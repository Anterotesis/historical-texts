<HEAD>THE
EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> WAS invited to pass a mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
last summer in Buckingham∣shire
by a friend, who paid an∣nually
a visit to his mother: a
lady pretty far advanced in years,
but extremely chearful, sensible, and well-bred.</P>
<P>She lived altogether in the country, in
a good old fashioned house, which was
part of her jointure; and it was to this
hospitable mansion he carried me.</P>
<P>The lady received me very politely,
as her son's friend; and I have great rea∣son
to be obliged to him for the introduction.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
My friend and I generally dedicated
our evenings to the entertainment of this
obliging Lady. She loved reading, and
was a woman of an excellent taste; but
as her years rendered that employment
not so easy to her as it had been, her son
and myself usually spared her the task,
and read to her such authors as she chose
for her entertainment; nor was she so con∣fined
to particular studies, as not to al∣low
us to vary our subjects as inclination
led us.</P>
<P>It happened one evening, which was
on the eve of the day appointed for our
departure, that we had made choice of
the tragedy of Douglas for our entertain∣ment,
when a neighbouring lady (a sensi∣ble
woman) who had drank tea with us,
desired to make one of our auditors.</P>
<P>After the tea-table was removed, we
entered on our task; my friend and I
reading alternately, to relieve each other,
that we might not injure the performance
by a wearied or flat delivery.</P>
<P>Neither of the ladies had ever seen or
read this play before; and both gave that
true testimony of nature to its merit,
tears.</P>
<P>When we had finished the reading of
it, they each in her turn bestowed high
praises on it; but the visitor lady said,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
that notwithstanding the pleasure it had
afforded her upon the whole, she had one
great objection to it. We were all im∣patient
to know what it was. I think,
said she, that the moral which it incul∣cates
is a discouraging lesson, especially
to youth; for the blooming hero of this
story, though adorned with the highest
virtues of humanity, truth, modesty, gra∣titude,
filial piety, nobleness of mind,
and valour in the most eminent degree,
is not only buried in obscurity, by a se∣vere
destiny, 'till he arrives at manhood,
but when he emerges into light, is sudden∣ly
cut off by an untimely death, and that
at a juncture too, when we might (mo∣rally
speaking) say his virtues <HI>ought</HI> to
have been rewarded.</P>
<P>We each spoke our thoughts on the
subject, as opinion led us, when the old
lady drew our attention, which she al∣ways
does, whenever she delivers her sen∣timents.</P>
<P>I should think as you do, madam, said
she, if there were not too many melancho∣ly
precedents to give a sanction to the fable
of that tragedy. I do not say but that the
poet, who is at liberty to dispose as he plea∣ses
of the works of his own creation, may
as well reward and punish according to the
measures of justice in this life; it might
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
perhaps make a better impression, and in∣deed
afford a more prevalent example to
the generality of young people. I say
therefore, I do not take upon me to
defend an opposite conduct upon princi∣ples
of poetic justice, but surely the
poet who prefers that course, may be
justified in it from every day's experi∣ence.
If we always saw virtuous people
successful in their pursuits, and their days
crowned with prosperity, there would be
more force in your objection; but the di∣rect
contrary is a truth, which every body
who has lived but a moderate number of
years, must have been convinced of from
their own observation. Amongst heathens
indeed, who looked no farther than <HI>this</HI>
life for good and evil, and whose only in∣citement
to virtue was the praise of men,
or what <HI>they</HI> called glory, such morals
might be dangerous; but surely amongst us
Christians they <HI>cannot,</HI> at least <HI>ought</HI> not to
have any ill effect.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I think it should serve
to confirm that great lesson which we are
all taught indeed, but which we seldom
think of reducing to practice, <HI>viz.</HI> to use
the good things of this life with that in∣difference,
which things that are neither
permanent in their own nature, nor of any
estimation in the sight of God, deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
On the other hand, to consider the evils
which befall us, as equally temporary, and
no more dispensed by the great ruler of all
things for punishments, than the others are
for rewards; and by thus estimating both,
to look forward for an equal distribution of
justice, to that place only, where (let our
station be what it will) our lot is to be un∣changeable.
It is in this light that I was in∣structed
in my early days, to consider the va∣rious
portions that fall to the share of man∣kind;
which very often, as far as we can
see, appear extremely partial; and no doubt
would really be so, were there not an invisi∣ble
world where the distributions are just and
equal. From this reflection I have drawn
comfort in many trying incidents of my life;
but in none more than the unhappy fate of
a lady, who was my particular friend; and
who, tho' a woman of most exemplary
virtue, was, thro' the course of her whole
life, persecuted by a variety of strange mis∣fortunes.
This lady, to use your expression,
madam (addressing her friend), to all hu∣man
appearance, <HI>ought</HI> at last to have been
rewarded even here—but her portion was
affliction. What then are we to conclude?
but, that God does not estimate things as
we do. It is ignorant, as well as sinful, to
arraign his providence. We daily see its
dispensations with our own eyes, in the va∣rious
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
accidents of life. Why should we
not then allow the poet to copy from life,
and exhibit to our view events, the proba∣bility
of which are founded on general ex∣perience?</P>
<P>We are indeed so much used to what
they call poetical justice, that we are disap∣pointed
in the catastrophe of a fable, if e∣very
body concerned in it be not disposed
of according to the sentence of that judge
which we have set up in our own breasts.</P>
<P>The contrary we know happens in real
life; let us not then condemn what is drawn
from real life.—We may wish to see nature
copied from her more pleasing works; but
a martyr expiring in tortures, is as just,
though not as agreeable, a representation of
her, as a hero rewarded with the brightest
honours.</P>
<P>We agreed with the venerable lady in
her observations; and her son taking oc∣casion
from her mentioning that unfortunate
person, who was her friend, told her, he
would take it as a particular favour, if she
would oblige me with the sight of that la∣dy's
story.</P>
<P>She answered, that as we had fixed upon
the next day for our departure, there would
not be time for me to peruse it, but that she
would entrust me with it to take it to town,
that I might read it at my leisure. It is
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
drawn up, said she, for the most part, by
the lady herself, and the occasion of its be∣ing
so was this. She and I had been inti∣mate
from our childhood; we were play-fellows
when young, and constant compa∣nions
as we grew up. We always called
each other sister, and loved as well as if we
had really borne that relationship to each
other. It was our continual practice, from
children, to keep little journals of what dai∣ly
happened to us; these, in all our short
absences, were matter of great entertain∣ment
to us; we constantly communicated
them when we met, or if we chanced to be
separated by any distance, we made a mu∣tual
exchange by the post of our little diur∣nal
registers, having made each a solemn
promise, not to conceal an incident, or even
a thought, of the least moment, from the
other; and this promise I believe was reli∣giously
kept up during a correspondence of
many years.</P>
<P>I had a brother about three years older
than myself; a very promising young man.
He was an only son, and the darling of his
parents: when he had finished his studies,
my father thought of sending him abroad,
but his fondness for him made him resolve
to accompany him himself.</P>
<P>A better tutor or a better guide he could
not have found for him; my father was
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
then in the prime of life, he had no other
children but him and me. My mother,
as fond of me as he was of his son, and per∣fectly
affectionate to my father, expressed
her wish to let both her and me be of this
party. She said, she thought a young lady,
under proper conduct, might improve as
much by seeing foreign courts, and the va∣rious
customs of different nations, as a young
gentleman.</P>
<P>I was then about sixteen: my father rea∣dily
consented, as he perfectly loved my
mother; and we all four set out on our
tour together. It was my lot, after I had been
some time abroad, to marry an English gen∣tleman,
then resident at Vienna! this occa∣sioned
my continuing there some years, and
it was during that space of time, that I had
the occurrences of my friend's life from her
own hand. As she had kept up to the me∣thod
we had agreed on of communicating
every thing that happened, even to trivial
matters, it generally increased the bulk of
the packets I used to receive from her, to a
prodigious size: these she sent off occasion∣ally,
at nearer or more distant periods of
time, according as I gave her the opportu∣nity,
by letting her know our motions.</P>
<P>I have from those papers selected the
most material parts of her history, and con∣nected
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
them so as to make one continued
narrative.</P>
<P>There were long intervals of time be∣tween
many of the most important incidents
of her life; but as the passages which inter∣vened
were either soreign to the main scope
of her story, or too trivial to be recorded,
in copying her papers they were omitted.</P>
<P>I have myself prefixed to her story a ve∣ry
brief account of the lady's family.</P>
<P>Thus much, Sir, added the good lady,
I thought necessary to premise to you, for
your better understanding her history, which
I have never yet shewn to any body but my
son.</P>
<P>When I took my leave, she put the ma∣nuscript
into my hands, with a charge to be
careful of it</P>
<P>We returned to town, and in less than
three weeks I had the mortification to hear
that this respectable old Lady, by whom I
had been entertained with so much friend∣ship
and politeness, was dead. Her son
(my friend) was on this occasion obliged to
go down into Buckinghamshire; it was
some months before I saw him again, as he
had a good deal of family business to settle.</P>
<P>When he came back to London, I offer∣red
to return him the manuscript, which he
had quite forgot. He told me, as he had
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
all the original papers, <HI>that</HI> the copy was
at my service.</P>
<P>I then expressed my wish that it were
made public. To this he at first objected,
as he said there were several persons living,
related to the parties concerned in some of
the principal events of the story, who might
take umbrage at it. I told him, that this
might easily be obviated, by changing the
names both of persons and places, which I
would undertake to do throughout the
whole; and I was afterwards so urgent with
him to comply with my request, that he at
last yielded. With his consent therefore I
give it to the world, just as I received it,
without any alteration, excepting the pro∣posed
one of a change of names.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
Miss SIDNEY BIDULPH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>RS. Catherine Sidney Bidulph,
was the Daughter of Sir Robert
Bidulph of Wiltshire. Her fa∣ther
died when she was very
young; and of ten children none survived
him but this lady, and his eldest son, after∣wards
Sir George Bidulph. The family
estate was not very considerable; and Miss
Bidulph's portion was but four thousand
pounds; a fortune however at that time
not quite contemptible: it was in the begin∣ning
of queen Ann's reign.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Lady Bidulph was a woman of plain
sense but exemplary piety; the strictness
of her notions (highly commendable in
themselves) now and then gave a tincture
of severity to her actions, though she was
ever esteemed a truly good woman.</P>
<P>She had educated her daughter, who was
one of the greatest beauties of her time, in
the strictest principles of virtue; from which
she never deviated, through the course of
an innocent, though unhappy life.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph was nine or ten years
older than his sister. He was a man of a
good understanding, moral as to his gene∣ral
conduct, but void of any of those refined
sentiments, which constitute what is called
<HI>delicacy.</HI> Pride is sometimes accounted lau∣dable;
that which Sir George possessed (for
he had pride) was not of this kind.</P>
<P>He was of a weakly constitution, and had
been ordered by the physicians to Spa for
the recovery of a lingering disorder, which
he had laboured under for some time. It
was just on his return to England that the
busy scene of his sister's life opened. An
intimate friend of hers, of her own sex, to
whom she revealed all the secrets of her
heart, happened at this juncture to go a∣broad,
and it was for her perusal only the
following journal was intended. That friend
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
has carefully preserved it, as she thinks it
may serve for an example to prove, that
neither prudence, foresight, nor even the
best disposition that the human heart is capa∣ble
of, are of themselves sufficient to defend
us against the inevitable ills that sometimes
are allotted, even to the best. ‘The race
is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong.’</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>April 2, 1703.</DATE></P>
<P>MY dear and ever-beloved Cecilia is
now on her way to Harwich. How
insipid will this task of recording all the little
incidents of the day now appear to me, when
you, my sister, friend of my heart, are no
longer near me? how many tedious months
will it be before I again embrace you? how
many Days of impatience must I suffer be∣fore
I can even hear from you, or commu∣nicate
to you the actions, the words, the
thoughts of your Sidney?—But let me
not grow plaintive, the stile my friend hates
—I should be ungrateful (if I indulged it)
to the best of mothers, who, to gratify and
amuse me on this first occasion of sorrow
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
which I ever experienced, has been induced
to quit her beloved retirement, and come on
purpose to London, to rouse up my spirits,
and, as she expresses herself, to keep me
from the sin of murmuring.</P>
<P>Avaunt then, complainings! Let me rest
assured that my Cecilia is happy in her pur∣suits,
and let me resolve on making myself
so in mine.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 3. We have had a letter from my
brother George; he is landed, and we ex∣pect
him hourly in town. As our house is
large enough, I hope he will consent to take
up his quarters with us while we stay in Lon∣don.
My mother intends to request it of him:
she says it will be for the <HI>reputation</HI> of a gay
young man to live in a <HI>sober</HI> family. I know
not how Sir George may relish the proposal,
as our hours are not likely to correspond with
those which I suppose he has been used to
since he has been absent from us. But per∣haps
he may not refuse the compliment; Sir
George is not averse to oeconomy.—
How kind, how indulgent, is this worthy
parent of mine! she will not suffer me to stay
at home with her, nay, scarce allows me
time for my journal. “Sidney, I won't have
you stay within; I won't have you write;
I won't have you think—I will make a
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
rake of you; you shall go to the play to
night, and I am almost tempted to go with
you myself, though I have not been at one
since your father's death’—These were
her kind expressions to me just now.—I am
indeed indebted to her tenderness, when she
relaxes so much of her usual strictness, as
even to <HI>think</HI> of such a thing.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5.—My brother returned to us this
day, thank God! in perfect health. Never
was there such an alteration seen in a man;
he is grown fat, and looks quite robust. He
dropped in upon us just as we sat down to
dinner: what a clutter has his arrival made!
my mother was <HI>so</HI> rejoyc'd, and <HI>so</HI> thank∣ful,
and <HI>so</HI> full of praises, and asked <HI>so</HI> many
questions, that George could hardly find
words enough to answer the over-flowings of
her kind inquisitiveness, which lasted all
dinner-time.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, my mother
proposed his taking up his abode with us:
you see, said she, your sister and I have got
here into a large house; there is full room
enough in it for you and your servants; and as
I think in such a town as this it will be a repu∣table
place for you to live in, I should be
glad of your company; provided you do
not encroach upon my rules by unreasonable
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
hours, or receiving visits from such as I may
not approve of for the acquaintance of your
sister. I was afraid Sir George would dis∣relish
the terms, as perhaps some of his ac∣quaintance
(though far from faulty ones)
might fall within my mother's predicament:
but I was mistaken, he accepted of the invi∣tation,
after making some slight apologies
about the inconvenience of having so many
servants: this however was soon got over.</P>
<P>To say the truth, I am very glad that my
brother has consented to be our guest, as I
hope by his means our circle of acquaintance
will be a good deal enlarged. There is no
pleasure in society, without a proper mixture
of well-bred sensible people of both sexes,
and I have hitherto been chiefly confined to
those of my own.</P>
<P>I asked Sir George, jocosely, what he had
brought me home? he answered, perhaps a
good husband.—My mother catched up the
word—What do you mean, Son? I mean,
madam, that there is come over with me a
gentleman, with whom I became acquainted
in Germany, who of all the men I ever
knew, I should wish to have for a brother.
If Sidney should fortunately be born under
the influence of <HI>uncommonly</HI> good stars, it
may happen to be brought about. I can tell
you (applying himself to me) he is prepos∣sessed
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
in your favour already; I have shewn
him some of your letters, and he thinks you
a good sensible girl. I told him you were
very well in your person, and that you have
had an excellent education. I hope so, said
my mother, looking pleased; and what
have you to tell us of this wonderful man that
so much surpasses every body? Why, ma∣dam,
for <HI>your</HI> part of his character, he is
the best <HI>behaved</HI> young man I ever saw. I
never knew anybody equal to him for sobrie∣ty,
nor so intirely free from all the other vices
of youth: as I lived in the same house with
him for some months, I had frequent op∣portunities
of making my observations. I
have known him to <HI>avoid</HI> many irregularities,
but never saw him guilty of <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>An admirable character, indeed, said
my mother. So thought I too; but I want∣ed
to know a little more of him. Now, Sid∣ney,
for your share in the description; I must
tell you he is most exquisitely handsome,
and extremely sensible.</P>
<P>Good sense to be sure is requisite, said my
mother, but as for beauty it is but a fading
flower at best, and in a man not at all neces∣sary—A
man is not the worse for it, howe∣ever,
cried my brother—No—my mother
answered, provided it does not make him
vain, and too fond of the admiration of giddy
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
girls—That I will be sworn is not the case of
my friend, answered Sir George, I believe
no body with such a person as his (if there <HI>can</HI>
be such another) would be so little vain of it;
nay, I have heard him declare, that even in
a woman he would give the preference to
sense and virtue.</P>
<P>Good young man! cried my mother, I
should like to be acquainted with him (So
should I, whispered I to my own heart.)</P>
<P>Well, brother, said I, you have drawn a
good picture; but to make it complete, you
must throw in generosity, valour, sweetness
of temper, and a great deal of money—Fie,
my dear (said my good <HI>literal</HI> parent) a <HI>great
deal</HI> is not necessary; a very moderate for∣tune
with such a man is sufficient.</P>
<P>The good qualities you require in the fi∣nishing
of my piece, answered my brother,
he possesses in an eminent degree—will that
satisfy you? As for his fortune—<HI>there</HI> per∣haps
a difficulty may step in—What estate,
madam, (to my mother) do you think my
sister's fortune may entitle her to?</P>
<P>Dear brother, I cried, pray do not speak
in that <HI>bargaining</HI> way.</P>
<P>My mother answered him very gravely,
your father you know left her but four thou∣sand
pounds; it is in my power to add a <HI>lit∣tle</HI>
to it, if she marries to please me. Great
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
matters we have no right to expect; but a
<HI>very</HI> good girl, as my daughter is, I think,
deserves something more than a bare equiva∣lent.
The equality, said my brother, (with
a demure look) I fear is out of all propor∣tion
here, for the gentleman I spake of has
but—six thousand pounds a year.</P>
<P>He burst out a laughing; it was not good-natured,
and I was vexed at his joke. My
poor mother dropped her countenance; I
looked silly, as if I had been disappointed,
but I said nothing.</P>
<P>Then he is above our reach, Sidney, an∣swered
my mother.</P>
<P>I made no reply—Have a good heart, Sid,
cried my brother; if my nonpareil likes you,
when he sees you, (I felt myself hurt, and
grow red) and without a compliment, sister,
(seeing me look mortified) I think he will,
fortune will be no objection. I have already
told him the utmost extent of your expecta∣tions;
he would hardly let me mention the
subject; he has a mind for my sister, and if he
finds her personal accomplishments answer a
brother's (perhaps partial) description, it will
be your own fault, if you have not the pret∣tiest
fellow in England for your husband.</P>
<P>My mother reassumed her pleased coun∣tenance.
Where is he? let us see him? I
forced a smile, though I did not feel myself
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
quite satisfied—We parted on the road, my
brother answered; he is gone to Bath for a
few weeks; he has sent his servants and his
baggage to town before him, and has com∣missioned
me to take a house for him in St.
James's Square, or some of the adjacent
streets; so that we shall have him in our
neighbourhood.</P>
<P>My mother enquired on what account he
went to Bath. Sir George said he complained
of a weakness in one of his wrists, which was
the consequence of a fever that had seized
him on his journey, in their return to Eng∣land.
It seems he had finished his travels,
on which he had been absent near five years,
when my brother and he met in Germany.
The liking he took to Sir George protracted
his stay, and he resolved not to quit him
while his health obliged him to continue
abroad; they took a trip to Paris together,
and returned home by Holland.</P>
<P>The name of this piece of perfection is
Faulkland, Orlando Faulkland. What a
pretty name Orlando is! My mother says it
is romantic, and wonders how <HI>sober</HI> people
can give their children such names.</P>
<P>Now am I dying with curiosity to see this
man. A few weeks at Bath—what busi∣ness
had he to go to Bath till he had first set∣tled
his houshold at London? His wrist
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
might have grown well without the pump.
I am afraid he is gone to Bath only to shew
himself, and that he will be snapped up be∣fore
he comes to town. I wish Sir George
had kept the account of him to himself, till
he returned to London again.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7.—We have settled Sir George's
oeconomy within doors: my mother has
been very busy all day in fixing trunks,
portmanteaus, and boxes, in their proper
places; and in appropriating the rooms for
his men, which she has taken care shall be
as remote from those of our servants as the
house will admit. She says, she knows our
own domestics to be orderly and regular,
but she cannot answer what other people's
may be.</P>
<P>I begin to recover my spirits: my bro∣ther's
arrival has given new life to the family;
my mother thinks that in <HI>his</HI> company, with
a lady or two, there will be no impropriety
in suffering me to go, at least, half a dozen
times into public during the season, even
without the sanction of her presence—
How kind, how considerate is this dear mo∣ther!
I find this was one (amongst others) of
her principal reasons for wishing Sir George
to be with us, as it will save her from the ne∣cessity
of going to public diversions, which
otherwise she would have done, rather than
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
have me debarred the pleasure of partaking
of them, through the want of a proper pro∣tector.
Every day lays me under fresh obli∣gations
to her.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20.—My brother has had ano∣ther
letter from Mr. Faulkland. He has
been but a fortnight at Bath, and already has
found benefit from the use of the pump; I
wish his wrist was quite well; I never was so
impatient to see any body—But, Sidney,
have a care—this heart has never yet been
touched: this man is represented as a dan∣gerous
object. What an ill-fated girl should
I be, if I should fall in love with him, and
he should happen not to like me? Should
<HI>happen,</HI> what a vain expression was that! I
would not for the world any one should see
it but my Cecilia.—Well, if he should not
like me, what then? why, I will not like
him. If I have a heart, not very suscepti∣ble
of what we young women call love; and
in all likelihood I shall be as indifferent to
him, as he may be to me—Indeed I think I
ought to resolve on not liking him; for not∣withstanding
those fine out-lines of a charac∣ter,
which my brother gave me of him in
the presence of my mother, I have since drawn
out of Sir George, who is always talking of
him, some farther particulars which do not
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
please me so well; for I think he is made up
of contrarieties.</P>
<P>Nature, says Sir George, never formed a
temper so gentle, so humane, so benevolent
as his; yet, when provoked, no tempest is
more furious. You would imagine him so
humble, that he thinks every one superior to
himself; yet through this disguise have I dis∣covered,
at certain times, a pride which
makes him look down on all mankind.
With a disposition formed to relish, and a
heart attached to the domestic pleasures of
life, he is of so enterprizing a temper, that
dangers and difficulties rather encourage than
dishearten him, in the pursuit of a favourite
point. His ideas of love, honour, gene∣rosity,
and gratitude, are so refined, that no
hero in romance ever went beyond him; of
this I was convinced from many little inci∣dents
which occurred in the course of my
acquaintance with him The modesty and
affability of his deportment makes every
body fancy, when he is in company with
them, that he is delighted with their conver∣sation;
nay, he often affects to be improved
and informed; yet there is a sly turn to ri∣dicule
in him, which, though without the
least tincture of ill-nature, makes him see
and represent things in a light, the very op∣posite
of that in which you fancied he saw
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
them. With the nicest discernment, where
he permits his judgment alone to determine,
let passion interfere, and a child can impose
on him. Though, as I have already told you,
he is very handsome, he affects to despise
beauty in his own sex; yet is it easy to per∣ceive,
by the nice care he takes in his dress
(though the farthest in the world from a fop,)
that he does not altogether disregard it in his
own person.</P>
<P>Are not these faults? yes, surely they are;
yet Sir George protests he has none; or at
least says, if these be such, they are so over-ballanced
by his good qualities, that unless it
be <HI>you,</HI> sister (flattering creature! though that
is seldom his failing) I don't know the wo∣man
that deserves him. I did not thank
him for the compliment he paid me, at the
expence of the rest of our poor sex.</P>
<P><HI>May 5.</HI>—A month is past since my bro∣ther
arrived, and Mr. Faulkland does not yet
talk of coming to town—If Sir George had
drawn half such a flattering picture of me
to him, as he has done of him to me, his
curiosity would have brought him here soon∣er.—
My mother has mentioned him several
times, and asked when he is to be in town?
My brother has taken a very handsome house
for him in the Square. We are all in expec∣tation
of this blazing star's making its ap∣pearance
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
in London. If he stays much
longer, my patience will be so tired, that I
will not give a pinch of snuff to see him.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19.—Six weeks, and no news of Mr.
Faulkland's coming! I'll positively give
him but another week; I begin to think
myself affronted at his stay.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23.—Now, now, my Cecilia, I
can gratify your curiosity at full: he is come
at last; Mr. Faulkland, I mean; Orlando is
come! we had a message from him this
morning, to enquire after all our healths; he
was just arrived at his house in the Square:
Sir George flew to him directly, and said he
would bring him without ceremony to take
a family dinner. My mother bid him do so;
and she held a quarter of an hour's confer∣ence
with her cook. She is always elegant
and exact at her table; but we were more
than ordinarily so to-day. My brother
brought Mr. Faulkland a little before din∣ner-time,
and presented him to my mother
and me, with that kind of freedom that al∣most
looked as if he were already one of the
family.</P>
<P>We had both been prepossessed highly in
favour of his figure, a circumstance that sel∣dom
is of advantage to persons on their first
appearance: but here it had not that effect:
Sir George did not over rate the personal ac∣complishments
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
of his friend. Now you'll
expect I should describe him to you, per∣haps,
and paint this romantic hero in the
glowing colours of romantic exaggeration.
But I'll disappoint you—and tell you, that
he is neither like an Adonis nor an Apollo
—that he has no hyacinthine curls flowing
down his back; no eyes like suns, whose
brightness and majesty strike the beholders
dumb; nor, in short, no rays of divinity
about him; yet he is the handsomest mortal
man that I ever saw.—I will not say that
his voice is harmony itself, and that all the
loves and graces (for why should not there
be male as well as female graces?) attend on
his motions; that Minerva presides over his
lips, and every feature has its attendant Cu∣pid—
But I will acknowledge that his voice
in speaking is inexpressibly pleasing (you
know how I admire an agreeable voice;) that
his air and motions are easy, genteel, and
graceful; his conversation sensible and polite,
and without the least tincture of affectation,
that thing, which of all others, would to
<HI>me</HI> destroy the charms of an angel.—In
short, without hyperbole, that he is, what
every one must allow, a perfectly handsome
and accomplished young man.</P>
<P>I never saw my mother appear so pleased
with any one. The polite freedom of his
address, the attention and deference he
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
seemed to pay to her sentiments (and the dear
good woman talked more to him, I think,
than ever I heard her do to any one on so
short an acquaintance,) delighted her beyond
expression. I bore no great part in the con∣versation,
but was not, however, quite over-looked
by Mr. Faulkland. He referred to
me in discourse now and then, and seemed
pleased with me; at least I fancied so. My
brother endeavoured to draw me out, as he
said afterwards. The intention was kind,
but poor Sir George is not delicate enough
in those matters; I should have done better
if he had let me alone. I thought of the
conversations we have so often had about Mr.
Faulkland, and could not help considering
myself like a piece of goods that was to be
shewn to the best advantage to the purchaser.
This reflection threw a sort of constraint
over my behaviour, that (fool as I was) I
had not courage enough to shake off, and I
did not acquit myself at all to my own mind.
I had, notwithstanding, the good fortune to
please my mother infinitely. She told me,
after our visitor was gone, that my behavi∣our
had been <HI>strictly</HI> proper; and blamed
Sir George for his wanting to engage me too
often in conversation. You may assure your∣self,
son, she said, that a man of Mr. Faulk∣land's
understanding will not like a young
lady the worse for her silence. She spoke
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
enough to shew that it was not for want of
knowing what to say that she held her tongue.
The man who does not reckon a modest re∣serve
amongst the chief recommendations of
a woman, should be no husband for Sidney.
I am sure, when I married Sir Robert, he
had never heard me speak twenty sentences.
Sir George agreed with her as to the propri∣ety
of her observation, in regard to a modest
reserve; but said, people now-a-days did
not carry their ideas of it quite so far as they
did when his father's courtship began with
her; and added that a young lady might
<HI>speak</HI> with as much modesty as she could hold
her tongue.</P>
<P>I did not interfere in the debate, only
said, I was very glad to have my mother's
approbation of my conduct. This put an
end to the argument, and my mother launch∣ed
out into high encomiums on Mr. Faulk∣land.
She said, upon her <HI>truth,</HI> he was the
finest young man she ever saw, in every re∣spect.
So modest, so well bred, so very en∣tertaining,
and so unassuming, with all his
fine accomplishments: She was quite asto∣nished;
and owned she had almost despaired
of finding a young gentleman, of the pre∣sent
mode of education, so <HI>very</HI> unexcepti∣onable
in his behaviour. If his morals an∣swered
to his outward deportment—
there she stopped; or rather Sir George in∣terrupted
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
her. I hope you'll believe, ma∣dam,
that my knowledge of mankind is not
so circumscribed, but that I can distinguish
between a real and an assumed character;
and I will venture to assert, that, in the circle
of my acquaintance, I do not know <HI>one</HI> so
unobjectionable, even in your strict sense of
the word <HI>morals,</HI> as Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Well, said my mother, I have the pleasure
to observe to you (and I think I am seldom
mistaken in my judgment,) that Mr. Faulk∣land
is at least as well pleased with Sidney as
we are with him—What say you? daughter,
Ay, what <HI>say</HI> you, sister? cried Sir George
—I think, madam, that Mr. Faulkland
is an accomplished gentleman, and—“and
that you could be content to look no far∣ther,
if matters are brought to bear; eh,
Sidney?” (I need not tell you whose speech
this was)—Brother, that is going a little
too far, for the first time of my seeing him.
A great <HI>deal</HI> too far, my mother said; let
us first know Mr. Faulkland's mind from
himself, before we say a word more of the
matter.</P>
<P>Sir George told us, that Mr. Faulkland,
at going away, had requested he would sup
with him at his own house, as he said he had
a few visits of form to pay, and should be at
home early in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
<HI>May</HI> 24.—My mother and I were in
bed before my brother came in last night,
though he keeps very good hours in general.
When we met this morning at breakfast, I
saw by Sir George's face that he was brim∣ful
of something—Faulkland don't like you,
Sidney, said he, abruptly—How can you
or I help that, brother? cry'd I, colouring;
tho', to tell you the truth, I did not believe
him; for I knew, if it <HI>had</HI> been so, he
would not have come out with it so bluntly.
But my mother, who always takes every
word she hears literally, took him up very
short; “If he does not, Sir, it is not polite
in you to tell your sister so; I hope Sidney
may be <HI>liked</HI> by as good a man as Mr.
Faulkland,” and up she tossed her dear
honest head. Sir George burst out a laugh∣ing.
My mother looked angry; she was
afraid her sagacity would be called in questi∣on,
after what she had pronounced the even∣ing
before. I looked silly, but pretended to
smile. Sir George was clown enough to
laugh on; at last (to my mother) “But,
my dear madam, can you believe me se∣rious
in what I have said? have you so
good an opinion of my veracity, or so ill a
one of my breeding, as to suppose I would
shock my sister by so rude a declaration, if
I meant any thing by it but a joke?” In∣deed,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Sidney, (looking half smiling at me)
I would not be as much in love with our so∣vereign
lady the queen, as poor Faulkland
is with you, for my whole estate.</P>
<P>This put me a great deal more out of
countenance than what he had said at first.
Nay, brother, now you are too extravagant
the other way—My mother looked sur∣prized,
but recovered her good humour pre∣sently—Dear
George, there is no know∣ing
when you are in earnest, and when not:
but, as Sidney says, now you are rather too
extravagant. You might say so to Faulk∣land,
answered my brother, if you were to
hear him; I could get nothing from him the
whole night but your praises. I thought,
said my pleased mother, he had not <HI>disliked</HI>
the girl—Now you see, son, her <HI>silence</HI>
did her no harm; and she smiled tenderly at
me. Come, said Sir George, things are
mighty well on both sides. Faulkland has
begged of me, that I would use my interest
with your mother, (whom he thinks one of
the best of women,) that he may be permitted
to form to make his addresses to Miss Bi∣dulph.
<HI>My</HI> interest he knows he has, and I
hope, madam, it will have your approbati∣on—He
desired me to explain minutely every
circumstance of his fortune: what his estate
is, I have told you; and his family is of
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
known distinction. He begged I would not
<HI>mention</HI> Sidney's fortune; and said, that if,
upon farther acquaintance, he should have
the happiness to be acceptable to my sister,
he should insist upon leaving the appointment
of her settlement to lady Bidulph and myself.
I told him I would lay this proposal before
you, and could for his present comfort in∣form
him, that, as I believed my sister had
no prepossessions in favour of any one else, I
was sure that if he met with your concur∣rence,
her's would follow of course.</P>
<P>A very discreet answer, said my mother;
just such a one as I would have dictated to
you, if I had been at your elbow. I believe we
may venture to suppose, that Mrs. Sidney
<HI>has</HI> no prepossessions; and as this is as hand∣some
an offer as can possibly be made, I have
no objections (if you have none, my dear)
to admit Mr. Faulkland upon the terms he
proposes.</P>
<P>What answer ought I to have made, Ceci∣lia?
Why, to be sure, just the one I <HI>did</HI> make
—I have no prepossessions, madam, looking
down and blushing, till it had actually paint∣ed
me, for I was really startled. My Cecilia
knows I am not a prude.</P>
<P>My dear! cry'd my mother, and took
me by the hand—</P>
<P>Poor Sidney, said Sir George, how you
are to be pitied! Mr. Faulkland purposes
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
waiting on you in the afternoon, if he is not
<HI>forbid;</HI> and he looked so teazingly sly, that
my mother bid him leave off his <HI>pranks.</HI></P>
<P>The day is over—Mr. Faulkland spent
the evening with us; no other company but
our own family. My mother likes him bet∣ter
even than before—Thy <HI>mother</HI>—disingenuous
girl! why dost thou not speak
thy <HI>own</HI> sentiments! (There is an apostrophe
for thy use, my Cecilia.) Well then, <HI>my</HI>
sentiments you shall have; you have an un∣doubted
right to know them on all subjects,
but particularly on this interesting one.</P>
<P>I <HI>do</HI> think Mr. Faulkland the most amia∣ble
of men; and if my heart were (happily
for me it is not) <HI>very</HI> susceptible of tender
impressions, I really believe I should in time
be absolutely in love with him. This con∣fession
will not satisfy you: may be it is not
enough—yet, in truth, Cecilia, it is all that
at present I can afford you.</P>
<P>The thoughts of the aukward figure I
should make in the evening visit, sat heavy
on my spirits all day.—Can you conceive
any thing more distressing than the situation
of a poor girl, receiving the visit of a man,
who for the first time, comes professedly as
her admirer? I had conceived a frightful idea
of such an interview, having formed my
notions of it only from romances, where set
speeches of an ell long are made by the
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
lover, and answers of a proportionable size
are returned in form by the lady. But Mr.
Faulkland soon delivered me from my anxi∣ety.
His easy, but incomparably polite and
sensible freedom of address, quickly made
me lose my ridiculous fears.—He made no
other use of his visit, than to recommend
himself more strongly to our esteem, by such
means as proved how well he deserved it.
If he was particular to me either in his looks
or manner, it was under the regulation of
such a nice decorum, that I (who supposed
I must have sunk with downright confusion)
was hardly disconcerted during the whole
visit.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 10.—I do really think my good
mother grows so fond of Mr. Faulkland,
that if he goes on at this rate, he will get the
start even of Sir George in her affections—
“Mr. Faulkland said so and so; Mr. <HI>Faulk∣land</HI>
is of opinion; and I am sure you will
allow Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI> to be a good judge of
such and such things.”</P>
<P>To say the truth, the man improves upon
you every hour you know him. And yet I
have discovered in him some of those little
(and they are <HI>but</HI> little) alloys to his many
good qualities, which Sir George told me
of. The interest I may one day have in him
makes me a closer observer than I should o∣therwise
be. There <HI>is</HI> that sly turn to ridi∣cule
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
which my brother mentioned; yet to
do him justice, he never employs it, but
where it is deserved; and then too with so
much vivacity and good humour, that one
cannot be angry wiih him.</P>
<P>We had a good deal of company at din∣ner
with us to day; amongst the rest, young
Sayers, who is returned from his travels, as
<HI>he</HI> calls it. You remember he went away
a good humoured, inoffensive, quiet fool;
he has brought no one ingredient of that
character back with him but the last; for
such a stiff, conceited, overbearing, talka∣tive,
impertinent coxcomb, does not exist.
His mother, who, poor woman, you know
originally made a simpleton of the boy, con∣tributes
now all in her power to finish the
fop; and she carries him about with her
every where for a show. We were assem∣bled
in the drawing-room before dinner: in
<HI>burst</HI> (for it was not a common entry) Mas∣ter
Sayers, and his mama, the cub handing
in the old lady—<HI>So</HI> stiff, and <HI>so</HI> aukward,
and <HI>so</HI> ungrateful, and so <HI>very</HI> unlike Mr.
Faulkland, that I pitied the poor thing,
who thought that every body would admire
him as much as his mother did. After he
had been presented to the ladies (for it was
the first time we had seen him since he came
home), he took a turn or two about the
room, to exhibit his person: then applying
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
himself to a picture which hung over the
door (a fine landscape of Claude Lorrain,
which Mr. Faulkland himself had brought
over and given to Sir George), he asked
my brother, in a tone scarce articulate, whe∣ther
we had any <HI>painters</HI> in England? My
mother, who by chance heard him, and by
greater chance understood him, answered,
before Sir George had time, <HI>Painters,</HI> Sir!
yes, sure, and some very good ones too;
why, you cannot have forgot <HI>that;</HI> it is not
much above a year since you went abroad,
(for you must know he had been recalled
upon the death of an uncle, who had left
him his estate). I observed Mr. Faulkland
constrained a very sly laugh, on account
both of the <HI>manner</HI> of my mother's taking
his question, and her innocently-undesigned
reprimand. Sayers pretended not to hear
her, but looking through his fingers, as if
to throw the picture into perspective, that
is a pretty good piece, said she, for a copy.
Oh! cry'd his mother, there is no pleasing
<HI>you</HI>—people who have been <HI>abroad</HI> are such
connoisseurs in painting—No body making
an immediate answer, Mr. Faulkland step∣ped
up to Mr. Sayers, and with such a ro∣guish
humility in his countenance, that you
would have sworn he was a very ignoramus,
aid, “Are you of opinion, Sir that that
picture is nothing but a copy?” Nothing
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
more, take my word for it, Sir: When <HI>I</HI>
was at Rome, there was a Dutchman there
who made it his business to take copies <HI>of</HI>
copies, which he dispersed, and had peo∣ple
to sell for him in different parts, at pret∣ty
good prices; and they did mighty well;
for very few people <HI>know</HI> a picture; and
I'll answer for it there are not many masters
of eminence, but what have a hundred ori∣ginals
palmed upon them, more than ever
they painted in their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland then proceeded to ask him
abundance of questions, which any one,
who did not know him well, would have
thought he proposed for no other end but a
desire of information; and the poor cox∣comb
Sayers plumed himself upon display∣ing
so much travelled knowledge, to a won∣dering
ignorant Englishman, who had never
been out of his own country. The com∣pany
were divided into little chattering par∣ties,
as is usual when people are whiling a∣way
half an hour before dinner. Mrs.
Sayers, my mother, and I, were sitting to∣gether
on a couch, near enough to hear the
conversation that passed between the two
gentlemen; at least as much as was not sunk
in the affected, half-pronounced sentences
of Mr. Sayers. His mother, to whom he
was the principal object of attention in the
company, seemed mightily pleased at the
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
opportunity her son had, from the inquisi∣tiveness
of Mr. Faulkland (whom she did
not know) of shewing his taste in the po∣lite
arts, and often looked about to observe
if any body else attended to them, My
dear literal woman! (as I often call her to
you) took every thing seriously, and whis∣pered
to me, how pretty that is, Sidney!
how condescending in Mr. Faulkland! you
see he does not make a parade of his <HI>own</HI>
knowledge in these matters, but is pleased
to reap the benefit of other people's. I,
who saw the latent roguery, could hardly
contain myself. Indeed I was amazed at
Mr. Faulkland's grave inquisitive face, and
was very glad my mother did not find him
out.</P>
<P>Sayers, elated with having shone so con∣spicuously
(for he observed that both my
mother and I attended to his discourse) pro∣ceeded
to shew away with an immensity of
vanity and frothy chat, beginning every new
piece of history with, “When <HI>I</HI> was at
Rome, or when <HI>I</HI> was Paris”—at last,
unluckily for him, speaking of an incident
(which made a good deal of noise, and hap∣pened
at the first mentioned place) in which
two English gentlemen had been concerned,
he said it was about eleven months ago, just
before he left Rome. My mother, who
had heard Mr. Faulkland relate the same
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
story, but with some very different circum∣stances,
immediately said, Mr. Faulkland,
have I not heard you speak of that? you
were at Rome yourself when the affair hap∣pened;
and if I be not mistaken, it was
through your interest with the cardinal of
—that the business was made up.</P>
<P>If a spectre had appeared to poor Sayers,
he could not have looked more aghast.
He dropped his visage half-way down his
breast, and for the <HI>first</HI> time speaking very
<HI>plain,</HI> and very loud too, with a stare of
astonishment, Have <HI>you</HI> been at <HI>Rome,</HI> Sir?
I was there for a little time, Sir, answered
Mr. Faulkland, with real modesty; for he
pitied the mortified buzzard; and I know
the story was <HI>represented</HI> as you have told it;
the circumstances differed in a few particu∣lars,
but the facts were nearly as you have
related them.</P>
<P>How obligingly did he reconcile the out-of-countenance
Sayers to himself and to the
compan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Were you long abroad, pray
Sir, said the coxcomb? About five years,
Sir, answered Mr. Faulkland; but I per∣ceive,
by the conversation I have had the
honour of holding with you to-day, that
many accurate and curious observations e∣scaped
me, which you made in a much short∣er
space of time; for the communication of
which I think myself extremely obliged to
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
you. Whether the poor soul thought him
serious (as my mother did) I cannot tell;
he made him a bow, however, for the
compliment; but was so lowered, that he
did not say a word more of Rome or Paris
for the rest of the day: and in this we had
a double advantage; for as we had nothing
else to talk of, his mouth was effectually
stopped, except when Mr. Faulkland, out
of compassion, asked him (as he often did)
such questions as he thought he could an∣swer,
without exposing his ignorance: for
he was contented to have enjoyed it in their
tête à tête, and was far from wishing the
company to be witnesses of it.</P>
<P>I think such a bagatelle may give you
some idea of this man's turn. I told it to
Sir George; he laughed heartily, and said
it was <HI>so</HI> like him! My mother loves even
his faults, though she will not allow me to
call them by that name.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 4.—You are unkind, Cecilia, and
do not do justice to my sincerity, when you
say, <HI>you are sure I am in love with Mr. Faulk∣land.</HI>
If I were, can you conceive it pos∣sible
that I would deny it to you? Ah! my
sister, must I suspect <HI>you</HI> of wanting can∣dour
by your making a charge of disinge∣nuity
against your friend? Indeed, Cecilia,
if I <HI>am</HI> in love with him, I do not <HI>yet</HI> know
it myself. I will repeat it to you, I think
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
him the most amiable of men, and should
certainly give him the preference, if I were
left to a free choice, over all the rest of his
sex; at least all that I have ever yet seen;
though possibly there <HI>may</HI> be handsomer,
wiser, better men, but they have not fallen
within my observation. I am not however
so prepossessed in his favour, as to suppose
him a phoenix; and if any unforeseen event
were to prevent my being his, I am sure
I should bear it, and behave very hand∣somely.</P>
<P>And yet perhaps this may be only bragg∣ing
like a coward, because I think a very
short time will put it out of the power of
fortune to divide us. Yet certain as the e∣vent
of our marriage appears to me at pre∣sent,
I still endeavour to keep a sort of
guard over my wishes, and will not give
my heart leave to center <HI>all</HI> its happiness in
him; and therefore I cannot rank myself
amongst the first-rate lovers, who have,
neither eyes, nor ears, nor sensations
but for one object. <HI>This,</HI> Mr. Faulkland
says, is his case, in regard to me. But I think
we women should not love at such a rate,
till <HI>duty</HI> makes the passion a virtue; and till
<HI>that</HI> becomes my case, I am so much a phi∣losopher
in love, that I am determined not
to let it absorb any of the other cordial
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
affections, which I owe to my relations and
my friends.</P>
<P>I think we ought always to form some
laws to ourselves for the regulation of our
conduct: without this what an impertinent
dream must the life be of almost every young
person of our sex? You, my dear, though with
an uncommon understanding of your own,
have always been entirely conducted by
your wise-parents; and in this I make it my
boast to have followed your example. I
have been accustomed from my infancy to
pay an implicit obedience to the best of
mothers; the conforming to this never yet
cost me an uneasy minute, and I am sure ne∣ver
will.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5.—A little incident happened to∣day,
which pleased my mother wonderfully.
She had been at morning prayers (as you
know is her daily custom); when returning
home in her chair, one of the men happen∣ed
to slip his foot, and fell down just before
Mr. Faulkland's house. He was so much
hurt, that he could go no farther; and the
footman immediately opening the chair, told
her she had better step into Mr. Faulk∣land's,
till he called another, or got a man
to assist in carrying her home.” One of Mr.
Faulkland's servants happened to be standing
at the door; so that, without any previous
notice, she was immediately conducted into
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
a parlour, where Mr. Faulkland was sitting
at breakfast. She found with him two pret∣ty
little children at his knee, to one of whom
he had given some cake; and the elder of
the two, a boy of about five years old, he
was gravely lecturing, though with great
gentleness, for having told a lye. My mo∣ther
asked him, with some surprize, whose
children those were? He smiled, and told
her they were his coachman's; and then or∣dered
the footman to carry them down, bid∣ding
the little boy be sure to remember what
he had said to him.</P>
<P>My mother enquired, if he permitted
them to be in the house? He said, he did;
and had been induced to do it from the dis∣tress
he had seen their poor father in, a few
days before. He is an honest careful fel∣low,
continued Mr. Faulkland, and has
lived in my family from a boy. He was
married to a good sort of a body, who took
great care of these children, and helped to
maintain them decently by her work. The
poor woman died in childbed last week;
and the person who attended her in her Ill∣ness
(for she had no servant) took that op∣portunity
of robbing the lodgings; and af∣ter
plundering the poor creature of every
thing that was worth carrying away, locked
up those two children, whom you saw with
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
me, and the new-born infant, with the
corpse of their mother.</P>
<P>The poor little wretches continued in that
dismal situation all night, having cried them∣selves
to sleep, without being heard, though
there were some other people in the house.
The morning following I happened to make
an early visit in the neighbourhood of this
distressed little family, and my coachman,
who was a very affectionate husband and
father, took that opportunity of calling on
his wife, whom he had not been able to see
for three days. The cries of his children
(now awake and almost starved) obliged
him hastily to break open the room door,
where the poor fellow was shocked with the
dismal spectacle of his wife lying breathless
in her bed, the infant almost expiring at
her side, and the other two poor little famish∣ed
creatures calling to their dead mother
for bread.</P>
<P>The sight almost deprived the man of his
senses. He snatched up his two eldest child∣ren
in his arms, and ran raving to the house
where I was; tearing his hair like a mad∣man.
He told me his mournful story;
with which I was so affected, that I ordered
one of my footmen to carry the two child∣ren
home to my house directly, and desired
their father to look out for some body to take
care of the young one; which he soon did.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47"/>
The honest poor fellow was delighted,
when he came home, to find his two child∣ren
well and merry; for they were sensible
of no want but their food. But his grief
returned on him with great violence at the
thoughts of his being obliged to put them
into the hands of people, who, he said,
he was sure would not be so kind to them
as their own poor mother had been; and my
man told me he did nothing but kiss them,
and cry over them the whole day. To
make his mind easy at once, I let him know
they should remain here under his own eye,
'till they were old enough to be put to
school; and accordingly directed my house∣keeper
to see that they were taken care
of; which has made their father very
happy.</P>
<P>The little rogues have found their way
up to me, and I love some times to hear
them prattle; but this morning the eldest
having told me a lye of his brother, I was
checking him for it when you came in.</P>
<P>My mother was so pleased with Mr.
Faulkland's conduct in this little history,
that she repeated it to me word for word as
soon as she came home, and concluded with
observing, how <HI>good</HI> a <HI>creature</HI> Mr. Faulk∣land
must be, who in so tender a manner
interested himself in his poor servant's mis∣fortune.
Most young gentlemen, said she,
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
would have thought they had done enough
in giving the servant money to have pro∣vided
for his childen how he could: it is in
such trifles as these that we often discover
the excellence of the heart.</P>
<P>You will suppose, my dear, that I am
not displeased at any circumstance that can
raise Mr. Faulkland's character in my pious
mother's esteem. I heard the story with
great pleasure; but not making any com∣ments
on it, Sir George (who was present
at the relation), said, Well, Sidney, you
are either very affected, or the greatest stoic
in the world; why, any other girl would
be in raptures at such a proof of the honest
tenderness of that heart which she knows she
possesses entirely, and on which the whole
of her future happiness depends. I am very
sensible of Mr. Faulkland's worth, brother,
I replied, and I can feel without being tran∣sported.
I will be hanged, said Sir George,
if I think you love Faulkland, at least not
half as well as he deserves; and I dare swear
you have not been honest enough to tell him
yet whether you do or not. It is time e∣nough
for that, I replied; if Mr. Faulk∣land
and I should be married, I hope I shall
give him no cause to complain of my want
of affection.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> you marry, said my brother! I know
of no possible <HI>ifs,</HI> unless they are of your
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
own making. I know of none neither, an∣swered
my mother; yet I think Sidney is
in the right to be doubtful about all human
events, Many things, added she gravely,
(for she has a great veneration for old say∣ings),
fall out between the cup and the lip.</P>
<P>I think, mother, said Sir George, blunt∣ly,
<HI>you</HI> were disappointed in your <HI>first</HI> love;
I have heard you speak of it, but I forget
the circumstances. As I had never heard
my mother make any mention of this par∣ticular,
I begged she would oblige me with
relating it.</P>
<P>When I was about one-and twenty, daugh∣ter,
said she, a match was concluded by
my father between me and a very fine gen∣tleman.
I loved him, and (as I suppose all
young women do in the like circumstances)
believed myself equally beloved by him.
The courtship had been of a year's standing;
for you must know I was not very easily
won. Every thing was settled, and the
day appointed for our marriage arrived;
when, instead of the bridegroom, whom
we every minute expected, there came a
letter from him directed to me. The con∣tents
were, that having formerly been en∣gaged
to a young lady by the most solemn
vows, he had, unfortunately for them both,
forgot them all on seeing me, and had broke
through every obligation divine and human
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
to obtain me. He intreated mine, and my
family's pardon, in the most pathetic man∣ner,
for having engaged our esteem so far
as to consent to an union, of which he
found himself unworthy, and which it was
impossible for him to accomplish; for, said
he, the wrongs I have done the woman,
whose youth I seduced, rise to my imagina∣tion
with so much horror, that, for the em∣pire
of the world, I would not complete
my guilt, by devoting that hand to another,
to which she only has a right. He enlarged
greatly on the sufferings of his heart, in the
struggle between his love for me, and his
duty to the person who had his vows; and
whom, he declared, his infidelity had al∣most
brought to the grave. He claimed
my pity, both on his own and her account;
and repeatedly intreated my forgiveness of
his fault.</P>
<P>The whole letter, which was very long,
was so expressive of a mind overwhelmed
with despair, that I was exceedingly shock∣ed
at the reading of it. What could I say?
The plea he offered for his seemingly
strange conduct, was too just to admit of
any objections. I own the disappointment
afflicted me, but I bore it with a becoming
resolution. My family were at first exceed∣ingly
exasperated against my doubly un∣faithful
lover; but, upon enquiring into
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
the facts, they found the truth to be as he
had represented it. The conclusion was,
that, upon the very day on which he was to
have been married to me, and on which he
had writ me that gloomy letter, he was
seized with a melancholy, which increasing
on him daily, soon after ended in absolute
madness, and he was obliged to be confined
for the remainder of his life. The young
lady lived but a short time after the melan∣choly
fate of her lover, and died, as it was
said, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>It was a great comfort to me to reflect that
my fate disposed otherwise of me than to
this unhappy gentleman; for I am very
sure, had these fatal events happened in con∣sequence
of my marriage with him, that I
should never have survived it.</P>
<P>This extraordinary anecdote of my mo∣ther's
life, which I had never had a hint of
before (for she could not speak of it with∣out
great emotion), very much affected me.
Sir George said, the story was more tragical
than he had apprehended, and told my mo∣ther,
<HI>that</HI> was an accident which fell out be∣tween
the cup and the lip, with a ven∣geance.</P>
<P>My mother continued thoughtful for a
good while; and I was sorry that the me∣mory
of this melancholy story had been re∣vived:
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
but Sir George talked and laughed
us both into spirits again.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 6.—This Mr. Faulkland is a
princely man; he has sent me <HI>such</HI> a set of
jewels! My mother says they are too fine
for a private gentlewoman; but George
tells her they are not a bit too fine for Mr.
Faulkland's <HI>wife,</HI> and only suitable to his
fortune. You know I have but few of my
own, those only which were my mother's
when she was a maiden. The greatest part
of her's, and by much the finest, were pre∣sented
to her by my father; but those she
reserves for Sir George, against the time of
his marriage, as a present for his lady; for
they are family jewels.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.—My probation is over, my
Cecilia.—The formidable question has been
put to me, and I have answered it—Ay
marry, say you, but how? In the <HI>negative,</HI>
to be sure, my dear—No, no, my Cecilia;
a valuable (psha! what an affected cold
word that is), a lovely and most worthy
man, with six thousand pounds a year, is a
prize that a country girl must not expect to
draw every day. Mr. Faulkland, in <HI>lover∣like</HI>
phrase, demanded from me the time of
his destined happiness: I referred him to
my mother. She, good and delicate as she
is, referred him back to Sir George.
George blurted out some sudden day that
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
startled us both, when Mr. Faulkland re∣ported
it to us. I stammered out some∣thing;
my mother hesitated; Sir George
came in, and blundered at us all; so I think
we compounded for the time, and amongst
us fixed upon this day month—And full
soon enough, says my Cecilia: you have
known the man but about six weeks, and
surely a month is as little time as you can
take, in preparing fineries. True, my girl,
true; but it is all George's doings. Indeed,
my Cecilia, without affectation, I had much
rather have had a longer day; though I think
I <HI>know</HI> the man as well in those six weeks, as
if I had been acquainted with him so many
years; for he has spent most of his hours
with us every day during that time; and
my mother says he is one of those in <HI>whom
there is no guile.</HI></P>
<P>Sir George is downright insolent; he de∣clares
I am not sensible of my own happi∣ness,
and that I deserve to be married to
some little petty Wiltshire 'squire. He so
piques himself upon making this match,
there is no bearing him. He has taken all
matters of settlement upon himself, and in∣sists
on my mother's not interposing. She
acquiesces, but charges my brother not to
let Mr. Faulkland's generosity carry him
too far, and bids him remember what is
due to his friend, as well as to his sister.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
<HI>July</HI> 10.—I really begin to be hur∣ried.
My mother, you know, is exactly
punctilious in every thing. Such a quantity
of things <HI>are</HI> bought, and such a quantity to
be bought, that there is no end of journies in∣to
the city. Then milliners and mantua-ma∣kers!—One
would think I was going to
pass the remainder of my life in a remote
country, where there were no kind of manu∣factures
or artificers to become at, and that
I was to provide cloathing for half a century.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12—I have much upon my
hands, and Sir George is so impatient, and
troublesome, that I believe I must employ
an amanuensis, to give a minute detail of
all our foppery; for I shall not have pati∣ence
to do it myself.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 17.—Sir George has often told
me, that he knows of no fault Mr. Faulk∣land
has, but a violence of temper when
provoked. I saw an instance of it to-day,
which I was sorry for, and the more so, as
I was in some measure accessary to it. Mr.
Faulkland, my brother, a lady of our ac∣quaintance,
and myself, took a ride in
Hide-park this morning. We were to
dine at Kensington (where my mother was
to meet us), at the house of the lady (a
relation of Mr. Faulkland's), who was
with us.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
We rode into the stable-yard of her house,
in order to alight. My horse which hap∣pened
to be a young one that Sir George
had newly bought, saw some object that
made him shy of advancing, and he turned
suddenly about. A footman of Mr. Faulk∣land's,
who chanced to stand just behind
me, very imprudently, though I am sure
without design of harm, gave him a stroke
with his whip, which made the animal
plunge and throw me, as I had not time to
recover my seat from the first short turn he
made. I luckily received not the least hurt,
and was on my feet in an instant. But Mr.
Faulkland, who had leaped off his horse
even before I fell, was so enraged at the
fellow, that he gave him too or three sound
lashes with his whip across the shoulders,
which fell on him as quick as lightning. I
am inclined to think the servant was not so∣ber;
for he had the insolence to lay hold of
his master's whip, and muttered an oath or
two ▪ Mr. Faulkland's attention being quick∣ly
turned to me, he took no farther notice
of the man. We went into the house; and
after I had assured them all I was not in the
least hurt, I begged of Mr. Faulkland to
forgive the footman, who had undesignedly
caused the accident. He made a thousand
apologies, for having let his anger so far
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
transport him, as to chastise his servant in a
manner he was not used to do; but the pe∣ril
he put me into, madam addressing him∣self
to me, made me forget myself. I repeat∣ed,
I hope, Sir, you have forgiven him. I
wish, my dear Miss Bidulph, said he, that
the fellow were guilty of no other fault but
this, that I might shew you my readiness to
obey you; but he is such an intolerable sot,
that there is no keeping him with safety. I
have forgiven him several idle things; but as
I had determined to part with him before
this happened, I hope you will be so good
as not to insist on my retaining him. I could
not intercede for the foolish fellow after this;
so said no more.</P>
<P>This little incident convinces me that Mr.
Faulkland is of too warm a temper; yet I
am not alarmed at the discovery; you know
I am the very reverse; and I hope in time,
by gentle methods, in some measure to sub∣due
it in Mr. Faulkland. His own good
sense and good nature must incline him to
wish it corrected. My brother says he has
often lamented this vice of his nature to him,
and said he had taken infinite pains to get
the better of it; and had so far succeeded,
that he seldom was surprized by it, but on
very sudden and extraordinary occasions;
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
such as, I suppose, he looked upon this to
be, which I have related.</P>
<P>We passed the day delightfully at Ken∣sington,
and did not return to town till late.
I think I have got cold, as we walked a long
time in the gardens.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13.—I have got an ugly sore
throat; my mother insists on my being let
blood; I am afraid of alarming her by com∣plaining,
though I had very little rest all
night. Mr. Faulkland came early this
morning to enquire after my health: my
mother told him I was not well. How
tenderly dejected were his looks, when I
came into the room. Sir George made him
stay to breakfast; he scarce tasted any thing;
he was quite cast down. My brother rallied
him (I thought it unseasonable) on the chance
he had the day before of his losing his wife.
Mr. Faulkland answered, I wish I had fol∣lowed
the first motion of my thoughts, and
discharged that wicked fellow a month ago.
Sir George said, as it happened, there had
been no harm done; but he thought Mr.
Faulkland would do well to dismiss such an
insolent rogue from his service. He has
saved me that trouble, said Mr. Faulkland, he
has dismissed himself; but took care first to
rob me. To rob you! we all repeated in
the same breath. Yes, said Mr. Faulkland:
I told him, after I got home, that he was
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
to deliver up such things as he had in his charge
to my own man, as I meant to discharge
him in the morning. He made me no re∣ply,
for he was a sullen fellow; but when
the family were asleep, he contrived to pick
the lock of a bureau in my dressing room,
where I sometimes keep money. I believe
what induced him to it was, his having
seen me yesterday morning, when I was go∣ing
to ride, (a precaution which I generally
use), put my pocket book into this place,
and I suppose he concluded there were bank
notes in it, for he took <HI>that</HI> (I presume with∣out
staying to examine it) and all the mo∣ney
he could find besides, and very cleverly
made his escape out of a back window,
which was found open this morning.</P>
<P>My mother lectured Mr. Faulkland a
little, for suffering a servant, whose fidelity
he was not sure of, to see where he deposited
his money; which, she said, might prove
a temptation to one, who was <HI>not</HI> so ill in∣clined
as this man. Mr. Faulkland ac∣knowledged
it was careless in him; but said,
in his own justification, he had been accustomed
to very honest people about him, which
rendered him less suspicious.</P>
<P>He appeared so anxious and unhappy
about my indisposition, that I affected to
make as light of it as possible; though in∣deed
I find myself very much out of order.
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
With what a kind sorrow did he observe
my looks; sighs now and then stole from
him, as his eyes were fixed on my face. I
am obliged to him, yet I think I should
be as much concerned for <HI>him,</HI> if he were
ill.</P>
<P>Here is a whole cargo of silks and laces
just sent in to me—Heigh-ho! I can't look
at them—I am not well—and I have such a
gantlope to run of visiting and racketting,
that the thought makes me sicker.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 27.—After 2 fortnight's, a dread∣ful
fortnight's intermission, I reassume my
pen. I have often told you, Cecilia, I was
not born to be happy. Oh! I prophesied
when I said so, though I knew not why I
said it.</P>
<P>I will try to recollect all the circumstances
of this miserable interval, and relate them
as well as I can. The last line in my jour∣nal
(which I have not yet ventured to send
you, as your stay at Paris is so uncertain)
informs you that I was ill. I was let blood;
but my disorder increased, and I was in a
high fever before next morning. I remem∣ber
what my reflections were, and am sure
my apprehensions of death were not on my
<HI>own</HI> account afflicting, but grievously so at
the thoughts of what those should feel
whom I was to leave behind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60"/>
My mother and Mr. Faulkland, I believe,
chiefly engaged my mind; but I did not
long continue capable of reflection. The
violence of my disorder deprived me of
my senses on the fourth day, and they tell
me I raved of Mr. Faulkland. I remem∣ber
nothing, but that, in my intervals of
reason, I always saw my poor mother in
tears by my bedside. I was in the utmost
danger, but it pleased God to restore me to
the ardent prayers of my dear parent. In
about ten days I began to shew some symp∣toms
of amendment, and enquired how
Mr. Faulkland did. My mother answered,
he is well, my dear, and gone out of town, but
I believe will return in a day or two. Gone
out of town, said I, and leave my dying! In∣deed
that was not kind of Mr. Faulkland, and
I shall tell him so. My mother was sitting on
the bedside, and had hold of my hand;
my brother was standing with his back to
the fire place. I observed they looked at
one another, but neither made me any an∣swer.
Pray, Sir George, I cried, would
you serve the woman so whom you were so
near making your wife? My brother was
going to reply, but my mother frowned at
him; he looked displeased, and went out
of the room. Dear madam, said I, there
is something the matter with Mr. Faulkland;
don't keep me in suspence. I <HI>know</HI> there
is something, which you and my brother
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
would conceal from me. Is Mr. Faulkland
sick? not that I know of I assure you, an∣swered
my mother; he was well yesterday,
for we had a message from him to enquire af∣ter
your health, as we have had every day,
for he is but at Richmond; and you know if
he were in town, he could receive no other sa∣tisfaction
than hearing from you, as you are
too ill to admit of any visits. My mother
rang the bell immediately, and asked me to
take something; I saw she wanted to turn
the conversation. My maid Ellen came into
the room, and I asked no more questions.</P>
<P>My mother staid with me till it was time
for her to go to rest; but avoided mention∣ing
Mr. Faulkland's name, or giving me
any opportunity of doing it; for she tenderly
conjured me to keep myself quite composed,
and not to talk. The doctor assured her this
night that he thought me out of danger;
and she retired with looks of cordial de∣light.</P>
<P>She was no sooner gone, than I called El∣len
to my bedside, and charged her to tell
me all she knew concerning Mr. Faulkland.
The poor girl looked concerned, and seemed
to study for an answer. Lord bless me,
madam! what should I know of him more
than my lady has told you? When did you
see him, said I? Not for several days, she
answered. Where is he? At Richmond, I
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
heard Sir George say; but I suppose he will
come to town as soon as he hears you are well
enough to receive him. I catched hold of
her hand; “Ellen, I know there is some∣thing,
relative to Mr. Faulkland, which
which you all want to hide from me; don't
attempt to deceive me; you may be sure,
whatever it be, I must soon be informed of
it; in the mean while, my doubts make
me very unhappy.”</P>
<P>The good-natured girl's trouble and con∣fusion
increased as I spoke: my dear madam,
she replied, when you are better, my lady
will tell you all: “No, no, Ellen, I must
know it now; tell it me this minute, or
you must never expect to see me better
under such uncertainty. What is the <HI>all,</HI>
the frightful <HI>all,</HI> that I am to be told? How
you have shocked me with that little word!”
I know nothing, madam, answered Ellen,
but what I gathered from Sir George's loud
angry talk with my lady; and I should be
undone if her ladyship were to know I men∣tioned
it to you. I assured her my mother
should not know it. Why then, madam,
(speaking lower,) I am afraid that Mr. Faulk∣land
has misbehaved, or has been belied
to my lady—She stopped at this—How?
how? cried I eagerly; what, has she heard
of him? something of another courtship,
she replied; but I hope it is all false—You
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
trifle with me—speak out and say all you
know. The poor creature started at my
impatience: “I know no more, madam,
than that I heard my lady say to Sir George,
I had rather Sidney were in her grave,
than married to him. Sir George said,
but why will you not let Mr. Faulkland
justify himself, madam? justify himself!
my lady answered; what can he say? is it
not plain that he is false to another woman?
they talked lower; but at last Sir George
raised his voice, and said, he would give
half his estate to have the villain punished
—All this, madam, I over-heard by
mere accident. Sir George was going
abroad; his linen was lying ready for him
in his dressing-room; and his man desired
me to put a stitch in one of his master's
point ruffles which was a little ripped in the
gathering. I had come up the back stairs
into the dressing-room, just as my lady
(who was with Sir George in the bed-chamber)
said the words I first repeated ▪
and while I stood doing the ruffle, I heard
the rest. There was a great deal more
said, but I could not distinguish any thing
besides, except a word here and there,
which Sir George seemed to speak in a
very angry tone. This was the second
day of your illness. Mr. Faulkland had
been here in the morning to enquire how
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
you did; my lady saw him, and I thought
they parted very friendly. I met Mr.
Faulkland coming down stairs; he looked
full of grief; my lady stood at the dining-room
door, and wished him a good morn∣ing.
About an hour after came a letter
directed to you; it was brought by a por∣ter,
who said it required no answer. As
you were too ill to read it, I gave it to my
lady; and it was soon after this, that I
heard the conversation between Sir George
and her ladyship. Mr. Faulkland came
again in the evening. Sir George was not
at home; but my lady had him above an
hour in the drawing-room; and the foot∣man,
who let him out, said, he looked as
if he were in sad trouble. He has never
been here since, but sends constantly every
day to know how you do. My lady or∣dered
me, if any letters came for you, to
deliver them to her. And has there any
come to me? No, madam; word was al∣ways
sent to Mr. Faulkland of your being
so ill, that to be sure he thought it would
be in vain for him to write to you.”</P>
<P>This was all I could gather from the maid.
What a night did I pass? I scarce closed my
eyes. Ellen lay in a field-bed by me; she
had watched several nights, and I obliged
her now to undress and go into bed. She
slept soundly; how I envied her tranquillity!
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
If I forgot myself for a few minutes, my
slumbers were distracted, and I started at the
recollection of what I had already heard, and
the dread of what I had <HI>still</HI> to hear. Mr.
Faulkland absenting himself from the house
so long; my mother wishing me in the
grave, rather than be his wife; my brother
denouncing vengeance on the <HI>villain!</HI> These
were the terrible ideas that haunted me till
morning. What can he have done, I cried
aloud several times? I summoned to my aid
all the fortitude I was mistress of, and re∣solved
not to sink under the calamity, be it
of what nature it would.</P>
<P>My mother, ever kind and tender, came
early the next morning into my room. She
enquired after my health, and looked as if
she <HI>pitied</HI> me. I was ready to cry at her
compassionate glances; they mortified me,
but I was determined not to let her perceive
it. I told her I was much better; and, what
is surprising, I was really so, notwithstand∣ing
the uneasy state of my mind. She talked
of indifferent things, and said, she hoped I
should soon be able to go into the country
for a few days, to recover a little strength.
I answered, I hope so too, madam. We
were both silent for a while; my mother had
her indulgent eyes fixed upon me; mine
were cast down: at last I resolved to speak
out. Madam, said I, looking steadfastly
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
at her, what is the cause of your coldness to∣wards
Mr. Faulkland? its in vain for you to
hide it longer; you say he is <HI>well,</HI> and gone
out of town. If he has shewn any slight to∣wards
me, tell me so at once; and do not en∣tertain
so mean an opinion of your daughter,
as to suppose she cannot bear the news.
Your tenderness, I see, would conceal <HI>some∣thing</HI>
from me; but believe me, madam,
I am prepared for the worst.</P>
<P>My dear, replied my mother, it gives me
great pleasure to hear you say so. I pray
God preserve my child, and grant her a bet∣ter
lot than she could hope for in a union
with Mr. Faulkland. What has he done,
madam? my dearest Sidney, this is the first
trial you have ever had of your patience;
but I have no doubt that your goodness and
discretion will teach you to act as becomes
your character.</P>
<P>I did not intend to have spoken to you on
the subject, 'till you were better able to bear
the knowledge of what I am going to ac∣quaint
you with; but your prudence, I
think, makes you equal to every thing;
and I hope your health will not be endan∣gered
by the discovery of Mr. Faulkland's
baseness. (What a dreadful preface!)</P>
<P>The day after you were taken ill, a letter,
directed to you, was brought hither by a
porter, which your maid (very discreetly)
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
delivered to me. As you were not in a con∣dition
to read it yourself, I thought proper
to open it. The cover contained a few
lines addressed to you; and in it was inclosed
a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland. Good
God, added she, taking the papers out of
her pocket, how little reliance ought we to
have on a fair out-side!</P>
<P>Here are the letters; read what is in the
cover first. I did so; it was ill writ and
worse spelt. These were the contents:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I hear you are soon to be married to Mr.
Faulkland; but as I think it a great pity that
so virtuous a young Lady should be thrown
away, this is to inform you, that he does
not deserve you.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter, wrote to him by a
fine and beautiful young lady that he decoy∣ed,
shews you how false he is. When you
tax him with it, he will know from whence
you got your information; but let him deny
it if he can.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, madam,
Your unknown friend,
and humble servant.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The letter to Mr. Faulkland, in a very
pretty female hand, and the date but a week
old (from the time it was sent to me) was as
follows:</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68"/>
“Oh! Mr. Faulkland, I am the most
unfortunate woman in the world Fatal have
you been to me, and I am undone for ever—
I was in hopes that our mutual fault might
have been concealed; for while we stayed
at Bath, I kept my aunt entirely ignorant of
what passed between us, though she often
pressed me to confess the truth; but it can
now no longer be concealed. I am but too
sensibly reminded of the unhappy conse∣quences
of my own weakness, and your un∣governed
(would I could call it) love. I ne∣ver
meant to trouble you with complaints;
but my present condition calls loudly for your
compassion. Are you then really going to
be married? There wants but this to com∣plete
my destruction! Oh! Sir, before it is
too late, take pity on me! I dare not con∣tinue
in the house with my uncle much long∣er.
My aunt says, that, when my affliction
becomes so conspicuous as not to be any
longer hid, she will form a pretence, on ac∣count
of my health, for me to be absent
for some months, under colour of going to
Bath, or to London, for better advice than
I can have here. But what will this avail me?
I have no relations, no friends, nor acquaint∣ance,
that I can trust with the secret of my
miserable situation. To whom then can I
fly, but to you, the cause of all my sorrow?
I beseech you for heaven's sake, write to me,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
and tell me, if indeed you are going to give
yourself away for ever! If you are, your in∣tended
bride, perhaps, may have no other
advantage of me, but what you in an evil
hour deprived me of. Write to me, dear,
though cruel as you are; and think of some
place of refuge for your unhappy</P>
<P>A. B.”</P>
<P>When I had read these letters, my mo∣ther
asked me, what I thought of Mr. Faulk∣land?
indeed, I was so astonished, that I
scarce knew what answer to make; but re∣plied,
madam, are you satisfied, that this
letter is not forged, with a design to injure
Mr. Faulkland? Ah! my dear, said she, I
am sorry you strive to catch at so slender a
twig; you may be sure I am but too well
convinced that the letter is genuine, or you
should never have had a moment's uneasiness
by the knowledge of it. Mr. Faulkland
himself does not deny it, and it is with his
permission that I kept it. I promised to re∣turn
it, but desired leave to retain it for a
few days. He could not refuse me this, tho'
he might easily imagine I designed to shew it
to you. That, indeed, <HI>was</HI> my intention,
when I desired to keep it a little while in my
hands, and I did so, that I might have your
judgment on the letter itself, as well as fully
to justify my own proceedings in what I have
done. Ah! dear madam, cry'd I, scarce
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
knowing what I said, I rely on your mate∣rial
goodness; I am sure you have done
what is proper. Yet has Mr. Faulkland no∣thing
to say for himself?—But I will ask
no more questions—I know too much al∣ready—My
love, said my mother, you have
a right to know every thing relative to this
affair.</P>
<P>I shewed the letters to your brother, as
soon as I received them. Sir George at first
seemed quite confounded, but afterwards,
to my very great surprize, he smiled and
said, he knew of that foolish business before.
I asked him, if he knew of him before, how
he could answer it to his honour, his consci∣ence,
or the love he ought to bear his sister,
not to divulge it immediately? Why, said
he, I assure you it is a <HI>trivial</HI> affair, that
ought not to make you uneasy.</P>
<P>What, George! answered I, a trivial
matter for a man to ruin a fine young lady,
forsake her, and dare to involve an innocent
creature in his crimes! Do you call this a
<HI>trivial</HI> affair? If you knew the <HI>circumstances,</HI>
said he, you would not view it in so disad∣vantageous
a light. Faulkland certainly
gained the affections of a young lady, tho'
without seeking to do so; he never courted
her, never attempted to please her, much
less to win her heart, and least of all to ruin
her virtue. I know that is an action he is
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
not capable of committing. How comes it
to pass then that he <HI>did</HI> so, said I, interrupt∣ing
him? Why, the girl was silly, and she
was thrown in his way by a vile designing
woman that had the care of her. “And
was he (again stopping him) to take
advantage of her folly, and join with that
<HI>vile designing</HI> woman, to destroy a poor
young creature's honour?” The <HI>best</HI> men,
said he, confidently, may fall into an error;
and if you expect to find a man entirely free
from them, you look for what is not possi∣ble
in human nature.</P>
<P>I may expect to find a man without fla∣grant
crimes to answer for, I hope; and I be∣lieve
I spoke it with warmth. Do you call
<HI>this</HI> one, madam, said he, with still more
assurance? I hope Sidney will not be such a
chit as to think in this manner, when she
comes to hear the affair explained. I really
grew down-right angry, and could not for∣bear
saying, I would rather see you married
to your grave than to such a man. Your
brother then begged I would hear Mr.
Faulkland <HI>justified,</HI> and be a little cool 'till
that was done. I told him there was a terri∣ble
fact alledged, of which I could not con∣ceive
it possible for him to acquit himself.</P>
<P>George said, he had a letter to shew me
on the subject, which he had received from
Mr. Faulkland while he was at Bath, and
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
which he was sure would convince me, that
the whole affair was so trifling, it ought by
no means to be objected to Mr. Faulkland,
nor, in his opinion, even mentioned to him.</P>
<P>I told him I was sorry to find that he and I
thought so differently; for that I was de∣termined
to speak to Mr. Faulkland imme∣diately
about it, and, if he could not satisfy
me entirely on the score of the injured lady,
that he must never think of Sidney more.</P>
<P>Your brother said, that the letter which
was sent to you had come from the revenge∣ful
dog who had robbed his master, and that
he would give half his estate to have the vil∣lain
punished as he deserved. Mr. Faulk∣land,
it seems, had told him this himself.
The fellow found it in the pocket-book which
he had taken out of the escrutore, and his
disappointment, perhaps, at not getting a
better booty, (for he found but twenty moi∣dores
besides,) joined to his malice against
his master, incited him to make the use he
did of this letter. Now, continued my mo∣ther,
though the fellow is undoubtedly a vile
creature, yet, my dear, I think <HI>we</HI> are
obliged to him for this discovery, providen∣tially
as it has come, to save you from what,
in my opinion, would be the worst of mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>The loss of this letter had alarmed Mr.
Faulkland so much, that he put an adver∣tisement
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
into the papers next day, worded
in so particular a manner, as shewed how
very fearful he was of that letter's coming
to light; for, no doubt, he suspected the
man might make a dangerous use of it.
The advertisement said, that if the servant,
who had absconded from his master's house
in St. James's Square the night before,
would restore the papers which he took with
him, they should be received without any
questions being asked, and a reward of
twenty guineas paid to any person who
should bring them back. This advertise∣ment,
which, to be sure, the fellow either
did not see at all, or had not time enough to
avail himself of it, shews you to what sad
resources people are driven, who, having
done unwarrantable actions, are often in the
power of the lowest wretches. I own this
circumstance gave me a very ill impression
of Mr. Faulkland. Your brother says, he
remembers this man was one of the ser∣vants
he took with him to Bath, and with∣out
doubt, he knew of his amour. The
advertisement has since been changed, by
Sir George's advice. I find the man is
named, his person described, and a reward
of fifty pounds offered for the apprehending
him; but I take it for granted he has got
out of reach.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Though this little digression was very
pertinent, I was impatient to know what had
passed between my mother and Mr. Faulk∣land
on the fatal subject, and could not for∣bear
asking her.</P>
<P>I shall tell you, said she, in order. Your
brother and I had some farther altercations;
and indeed, my dear, it amazes me to find,
that a young man, educated as Sir George
was, in the early part of life, in the strictest
principles of virtue, and the son of parents,
who, thank God, always gave him the best
example, should have so far deviated from
the sober paths he was brought up in, as to
treat the most glaring vices with a levity that
shocked me. But, I suppose, the company
he kept abroad, among whom this hypocrite
Faulkland was his chief, has quite perverted
him. He gave me the letter to read, which
he had received from his friend whilst he was
at Bath; and which, he said, was to con∣vince
me that it was such a <HI>trifling</HI> affair,
that we ought not to take the least notice of
it. And all his reason for this was, truly,
because that loose man treats the subject as
lightly as he does. I am afraid Sir George
is no better than himself, or he would not
have ventured to make him the confidant of
his wild amours; and that at a time too
when he was encouraged to address you.
He tells him of a very pretty young lady (in∣nocent
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
he says too) that he got acquainted
with, who came to Bath under the care of
an aunt and uncle; he talks some idle stuff
of avoiding her, when he found she liked
him, and that the aunt (wicked woman!)
contrived to leave them together one even∣ing,
when, I understand, the poor young
creature fell into the snare that was prepared
for her. For, would you believe it, my dear,
the monstrous libertine, notwithstanding his
pretences, owned that he had paid a price for
the girl to her aunt. The betrayed creature
herself knew not of this.</P>
<P>I own I had not patience to read the letter
through. To say the truth, I but ran my
eye in a cursory manner over it; I was afraid
of meeting, at every line, something offen∣sive
to decency. And <HI>this</HI> was the account,
which, in your brother's opinion, was en∣tirely
to exculpate Mr. Faulkland. I think
I never was so angry. I threw the letter to
George with indignation, telling him, I
was ashamed to find, that he, after knowing
an incident of this kind, had so little regard
to the honour of his sister, as to promote a
marriage between her and such a rake. He
answered, if I kept you unmarried till I
found such a man as <HI>I</HI> should <HI>not</HI> call a rake,
you were likely to live and die a maid. That
for his part, he was very sorry, as well for
Mr. Faulkland's sake as yours, he had ever
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
proposed a union, which he found was likely
to be overthrown by unseasonable scruples.
And the gentleman, in a violent passion,
flung out of the room, without deign∣ing
even to take up the letter which had
fallen on the floor.</P>
<P>I presume he went directly to his friend
Faulkland, and told him all that had passed;
for the plausible man came to me in the even∣ing,
and with looks, full of pretended sor∣row,
but <HI>real</HI> guilt, begged I would hear
him on the subject of a letter which he said
he found had unfortunately prejudiced me
against him. To be sure he was prepared,
and had, with George's help, contrived an
artful story to impose on me. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e took me
unawares; but I was resolved not to give him
the advantage of arguments, but proceed to
ask him a few plain questions. I therefore
cut him short at once, by saying, Mr. Faulk∣land,
I am extremely concerned and shocked
at what has happened; I will say but few
words to you, and desire to hear nothing
more than answers to my questions: he bow∣ed,
and remained silent.</P>
<P>I then asked him, taking the young lady's
letter out of my pocket, whether that was
from the same person, of whom he had
written an account to my son whilst he was
at Bath? He answered, it is, madam; and
I hoped from that letter, which I find Sir
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
George has shewn you, you would be in∣duced
to believe that I never formed a
thought of injuring that young lady, till some
unfortunate circumstances combined, and
suddenly surprized me into the commission
of a fault that has made us both unhappy.
Sir, said I, I don't pretend to know people's
hearts, I can only judge of them from their
actions. You acknowledge that she was a
fine young woman, and you believe innocent:
what excuse can you offer for being her de∣stroyer?
dear madam, don't use so severe an
expression—Sir, I can use no other: how
can you extenuate the fault, by which you
merit so severe an appellation? to a lady of
your rigid delicacy, madam, said he, per∣haps
what youth could offer, in extenuation
of the fault, might appear but a weak plea:
yet 'tis most certain, that I was surprized in∣to
the fatal error: I am under no promises,
no ties, no engagements whatsoever to the
lady. No ties, Sir! (interupting him) is
your own honour no tie upon you, supposing
you free from any other obligation? You see
the consequence of this fatal error, as you call
it: here is a young person, of fashion, perhaps
(I don't enquire who she is, but she seems to
have had no mean education,) who is likely
to bring a child into the world, to the dis∣grace
of herself and her family. On you,
Sir, she charges her dishonour, and men∣tions
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
your marrying another, as the blow
which is to complete her ruin. Mr. Faulk∣land,
is not all this truth? be so good as to
give me a direct answer. Madam, I cannot
deny it; you have the proof of it in your
hands: from all that appears to you, I am
indeed very blameable; nay, I do not pre∣tend
to vindicate my folly; but, madam, do
not aggravate my fault in your own thoughts,
by considering the affair in a more unfavoura∣ble
light than what even her letter puts it! I
conjure you, madam, to suffer Sir George
to be my advocate on this occasion; he is
acquainted with every particular of the
transaction, and can give you a detail that I
will not presume to do. Be pleased, Sir,
replied I, to tell me what you mean to do
in regard to this lady? I mean to do all that
I <HI>can</HI> do, answered he; I shall provide a
place of retreat for her, where she will meet
with the utmost care, tenderness, and respect;
and where she may continue with privacy till
she is in a condition to return home again to
her friends. You may be sure, madam, as
to the rest, I shall acquit myself consistently
with honour. That is as much as to say,
Sir, said I, that you will take care of the
maintenance of your poor babe. He looked
as if he had a mind to smile, forward man!
but constrained it. Doubtless, madam, I
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
shall do all that is now in my power to do,
in every circumstance relating to her.</P>
<P>I felt myself exceedingly displeased with
him; I was so disappointed in my opinion
of him, that it increased my resentment.
Sir, I proceeded, I must inform you, that
there is as much <HI>now</HI> in your power as ever
there was. You are still unmarried; the
way is open to you, to repair the mischief
you have done: I will never bring down the
curses of an injured maid upon my daugh∣ter's
head, nor purchase her worldly prospe∣rity
at the expence of the shame and sorrow
of another woman, for aught I know, as
well born, as tenderly bred, and, till she
knew you, perhaps as innocent as herself.
For heaven's sake, madam, he cry'd, don't,
don't, I beseech you, pronounce my fate so
hastily—You must pardon me, Sir, said I,
if I beg to hear no more on this subject.
Sir George has already said every thing you
could expect of your friend to say in your
justification, and more than became him to
utter. All I can find by either you or him,
is, that you think the loss of honour to a
young woman is a trifle, which a man is not
obliged to repair, because truly he did not
<HI>promise</HI> to do so. This young creature, I
understand, is a gentlewoman, very charm∣ing
in her person, by your own account;
one who loves you tenderly, and will shortly
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
make you a father. Is not all this so? I
grant it, madam, said the criminal. Then,
Sir, what reason can you urge in your con∣science
for not doing her justice? None—
but your own inconstant inclinations, which
happen now, to be better pleased with ano∣ther
woman, whom, perhaps, you might
forsake in a few months.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to repeat to you all he said
upon this last article: words of course, you
may be sure. He entreated, over and over
again, that I would permit Sir George to
plead for him. I told him, that after the
facts he had granted, it was impossible that
either he or Sir George could make the affair
better; that I was very sorry to find myself
disappointed in a person of whom I had con∣ceived
so high an opinion; and added, that
as your illness made it very improper to let
you know any thing of the matter for the
present, I should take it as a favour, if he
would permit me to retain the lady's letter to
him for a few days, or till you were in a
condition to have the matter broke to you.
In the mean while, I requested that he would
dispense with my receiving any more visits
from him.</P>
<P>He said some frantic things (for the man
seems of a violent temper;) but finding me
peremptory, took his leave with respect.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
I understand from Sir George, that he
flew directly down to Richmond, to a little
house he has there, where he has remained
ever since; but sends every day to enquire
after your health. Sir George, I am sure,
sees him often; for he frequently goes out
early in the morning, and stays abroad till
night. The increase of your illness, from
the time I received the last visit from Mr.
Faulkland, to such a degree as to alarm us
for your life, I suppose, prevented your
brother from reassuming the subject; tho'
I can perceive he is full of anger and vexa∣tion
on the occasion. You are now, my
dear, God be praised, in a hopeful way of
recovery, and I expect that George (who
has, by espousing this man's interests so
warmly, very much offended me,) that
George, I say, will renew his sollicitations
in his favour. What do you say, my child?
I should be glad to know your thoughts,
with regard to the part I have acted, as well
as with respect to Mr. Faulkland's conduct.</P>
<P>Shall I own my weakness to you, my dear
Cecilia? I was ready to melt into tears; my
spirits, exhausted by sickness, were not proof
against this unexpected blow; a heavy sigh
burst from my heart, that gave me a little
relief. You know my mother is rigid in her
notions of virtue; and I was determined to
shew her that I would endeavour to imitate
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
her. I therefore suppressed the swelling
passion in my breast, and with as much com∣posure
as I could assume, told her, I thought
she acted as became her; and that, with re∣gard
to Mr. Faulkland, my opinion of his
conduct was such, that I never desired to see
him more. This answer, dictated perhaps
by female pride (for I will not answer for
the feelings of my heart at that instant)
was so agreeable to my mother, that she
threw her arms about my neck, and kissed
me several times; blessing, and calling me
by the most endearing names at every inter∣val.
Her tenderness overcame me; or, to
deal with sincerity, I believe I was willing to
make it an excuse for weeping. Oh! my
dear mother, cry'd I, I have need of your
indulgence; but indeed your goodness quite
over-powers me. My dear love, said she,
you deserve it all, and more than it is in your
mother's power to shew you. What a
blessed escape have you had, my sweet child,
of that wild man! Little did I think, my
Sidney, when I told you the story of my
first disappointment, that a case so parallel
would soon be your own. With respect to
you and me indeed, the incidents are nearly
alike; but there is a wide difference between
the two men. My lover had the grace to
repent, and would have returned to his first
engagements, if a dreadful malady had not
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
overtaken him; but this graceless Faulkland
persists in his infidelity, and would make
you as culpable as himself. I own to you,
daughter, that the recollection of that me∣lancholy
event which happened to me,
has given me a sort of horror at the
very thoughts of an union between you and
Mr. Faulkland. You remember the sad
consequences which I related to you of an
infidelity of this kind; the poor forsaken
woman died of grief, and the dishonest lo∣ver
ran mad. Think of this, my child, and
let it encourage you to banish such an un∣worthy
man from your heart. I was afraid
your regard for him might make this a dif∣ficult
task; but I rejoice to find your virtue
is stronger than your passion. <HI>I</HI> loved
as well as you, but I overcame it when
I found it a duty to do so; and I see your
mother's example is not lost upon you.</P>
<P>The honest pride that my mother endea∣voured
to inspire me with, had a good effect,
and kept up my spirits for a time. She told
me, she was sure that Sir George would
quarrel with us both, when we came to talk
upon the subject of the marriage; but she
was entirely easy as to that, now she knew
that my sentiments corresponded with her
own.</P>
<P>You know my mother has ever been de∣spotic
in her government of me; and had I
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
even been inclined to dissent from her judge∣ment
in a matter of this importance, it
would have been to no purpose; but this
was really far from my thoughts.</P>
<P>I was as much disgusted with Mr. Faulk∣land
as she was, and as heartily pitied the
unhappy young creature whom he had un∣done.</P>
<P>You may recollect, my dear, that my
mother, though strictly nice in every parti∣cular,
has a sort of partiality to her own sex,
and where there is the least room for it,
throws the whole of the blame upon the
<HI>man</HI>'s side; who, from her own early pre∣possessions,
she is always inclined to think
are deceivers of women. I am not surprized
at this bias in her; her early disappointment,
with the attending circumstances, gave her
this impression. She is warm, and some∣times
<HI>sudden,</HI> in her attachments; and yet it
is not always difficult to turn her from them.
The integrity of her own heart makes her
liable to be imposed on by a plausible out∣side;
and yet the dear good woman takes a
sort of pride in her sagacity. She had ad∣mired
and esteemed Mr. Faulkland prodi∣giously;
her vexation was the greater, in
finding her expectations disappointed; and
could I have been so unjust to the pretensi∣ons
of another, or so indelicate in regard to
myself, as to have overlooked Mr. Faulk∣land's
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
fault, I knew my mother would be
inflexible. I therefore resolved in earnest to
banish him from my thoughts. I found my
mother was mightily pleased with her own
management of the conversation she had
held with Mr. Faulkland. I think I talked
pretty <HI>roundly</HI> to him, said she; but there
was no other way; he is an artful man, and I
was resolved not to let him wind me about.
He would make a merit of having <HI>formed
no designs</HI> upon the young lady; why, pos∣sibly,
he did not, till he found the poor soul
was so smitten with him, that he thought she
would be an easy prey. Sir George impu∣dently
insinuated, that a man <HI>must</HI> not reject
a lady upon these occasions. I was ashamed
to hint to Mr. Faulkland at the circumstance
of his having actually paid a price for the
girl; it was too gross; and I think, had I
mentioned it, must have struck him dumb:
though very likely he might have had some
subterfuge, even for that aggravating part of
the story.</P>
<P>How I am shocked, my Cecilia, to think
of this! I was glad my mother had spared
his confusion on this particular; for though
probably, as she observed, he had come
prepared with some evasion to this charge,
yet what a mean figure must a man make,
who is reduced to disingenuous shifts, to ex∣cuse
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
or palliate an action, despicable as well
as wicked!</P>
<P>My brother came in, during our discourse,
to ask me how I did. My mother answered
his question before I had time to speak. She
is pretty well, thank God! and not likely
to break her heart, though she <HI>knows</HI> your
friend Mr. Faulkland's story (and she spoke it
scornfully.) My brother said, Sidney, are <HI>you</HI>
as averse to Mr. Faulkland as my mother is?
I replied, brother, I wonder you can ask me
that question, after what you have been just
now told. I always said, answered he, that you
did not know the value of the man, and
now I am convinced of it. I wish he had
never seen you! I wish so too, said I. Sir
George walked about the room, and seemed
vexed to death. For Heaven's sake, madam,
(turning to my mother) now my sister is to∣lerably
recovered, suffer her to see Mr.
Faulkland; let her hear what he has to say
in his own vindication: I think you may trust
to her honour, and her discretion; and if the
affair appears to her in so heinous a light as
it does to you, I will be contented to give
Mr. Faulkland up; but don't shut your own
ears, and your daughter's too, against con∣viction.</P>
<P>Sir, you are disrespectful, said my mo∣ther
angrily. Dear brother, I cried, I beg
you will spare me on this subject; my mo∣ther
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
<HI>has</HI> given me leave to judge for my∣self;
she has repeated all that you have
said, and all that Mr. Faulkland has been
able to urge on the occasion; and I am
sorry to tell you, that I think myself bound
never to have any farther correspondence
with him; therefore you must excuse me
for not seeing him. And so the match is
broke off, cried Sir George. <HI>It is,</HI> said my
mother peremptorily. It is, ecchoed I faintly.
Why then, replied Sir George (and he swore),
you will never get such another whilst you
live. A pretty figure you'll make in the
world, when you give it for a reason that
you refused <HI>such</HI> a man, after every thing
was concluded upon, because truly you found
that he had had an intrigue! Why, Sidney,
you'll be so laugh'd at! He addressed him∣self
to me, though I knew he meant the re∣proof
for my mother. Sir, answered she,
neither your sister nor I shall trouble our∣selves
much about the opinion of people
who <HI>can</HI> laugh at such things. You may
put the matter into as ridiculous a light as
you please: but this was no common in∣trigue;
you <HI>know</HI> it was not, however you
may affect to speak of it. I don't suppose
<HI>any</HI> of you are <HI>Saints,</HI> but I trust in Hea∣ven,
some are better than others. Oh! ma∣dam,
madam, said my brother, if you knew
the world as well as <HI>I</HI> do, you would think
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
that Mr. Faulkland is one of the best. God
forbid! my mother answered coolly. Well,
well, madam, cry'd Sir George, I see it is
to no purpose to argue; there are many fa∣milies
of more consequence than ours, and
ten times the fortune, that will be very
proud of Faulkland's alliance; and will
hardly make it an objection to him, that he
was led into a foolish scrape by the wickedness
of one woman, and the folly of another.
If you make my sister wait for a husband,
till you find a man who never offended in
that way, I think, mother, you had better
take a little boy from his nurse, breed him
up under your own eye, and by the time
Sidney is a good motherly gentlewoman,
you may give her the baby to make a play∣thing
of. For my own part, I am heartily
sorry I ever interfered.—People of such nice
scruples had better chuse for themselves;
but I cannot help thinking, that both Faulk∣land
and I are very ill used. I told you (said
my mother to me) how he would behave.
Sir George, I desire you will not distress
your sister thus (she saw me sadly cast down:
I was ill and weak:) if you have no respect
for <HI>me,</HI> have a little tenderness for her.—I
beg your pardon, child, said he, I did not
mean to distress you, I pity <HI>you,</HI> indeed, Sid∣ney.
I could have cry'd at his using that
expression, it humbles one so. Madam (to
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
my mother,) you shall be troubled no farther
by my friend or myself; all I shall say, is
this, that whenever my sister gets a husband
of your ladyship's chusing, I wish he may
have half the worth of the poor rejected
Faulkland.</P>
<P>My brother left the room with these
words. My mother was downright in a
passion, but soon cooled on his withdrawing.</P>
<P>My spirits were quite fatigued; and my
mother left me, that I might take a little rest.</P>
<P>What a strange alteration have a few days
produced! our domestic peace broke in up∣on
by the unlucky difference between my
mother and my brother. My near prospect
of—of—oh! let me be ingenuous,
and say Happiness, vanished—Poor Mr.
Faulkland! <HI>Poor</HI> do I call him? for shame,
Sidney—but let the word go; I will not
blot it Mr. Faulkland forbid the house,
myself harrassed by a cruel disorder, and
hardly able to crawl out of bed. All this
has fallen on me within these last fourteen
black days. Then I dread the going abroad,
or seeing company, I shall look so silly;
for the intended wedding began to be talk∣ed
of;—and the curiosity of people to
know the cause of it's being broke off—
What wild guesses will be made by some,
and what lies invented by others! Then the
ill-natured mirth of one half of the girls of
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
my acquaintance, and the <HI>as</HI> provoking con∣dolements
of the other half—I am fretted
at the thoughts of it—but it cannot be
I must bear it all—I wish I were helped;
enough to get into the country, to be well
out of the reach of such impertinence.</P>
<P>I long to know▪ who this ill-fated▪ girl is,
that has been the cause of all this. <HI>A gen∣tlewoman,
and very pretty; one that loves
Mr. Faulkland, and will shortly make him a
parent.</HI> Thus my mother described her to
Mr. Faulkland, and he assented to it. Oh!
fie, fie, Mr. Faulkland, how could you be
so cruel to <HI>her?</HI> How could you use me so
ill? and Sir George knew of all this, and
makes light of it! it is a strange story! My
mother is severe in her virtue, but she is in
the right—My brother would sacrifice every
consideration to aggrandize his family—To
make a purchase of the unhappy creature,
and that without her knowledge too, it is
horrid! A way, away from my thoughts,
thou vile intruder—Return to your Bath mi∣stress,
she has a better right to you than I
have; she implores your pity; she has no
refuge but you; and she may be every way
preferable to me—I wish I knew her name,
but what is it to me; <HI>mine</HI> will never be
Faulkland, <HI>hers</HI> ought. Perhaps Mr Faulk∣land
may be induced to marry her, when
he sees her in her present interesting situati∣on.
He says he will provide a retreat for
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
her; to be sure he will have the compassion
to visit her: and then who knows what
may happen? If I know my own heart,
I think I do most sincerely wish he may
make her his wife; but then I would not
chuse to have it known suddenly; that
might look as if he forsook me for her.
<HI>That,</HI> I own, would a little hurt my pride.
I wish not the truth to be known, for Mr.
Faulkland's sake; but then I should not
like to have a slur thrown on me.</P>
<P>I will add no more to this, but send the
packet off at all events; I think it will find
you at Paris.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1.—My health promises to
return: my mother praises me, and calls
me a Heroine. I begin to fancy myself
one: our pride sometimes stands in the
place of virtue.</P>
<P>Sir George went to Richmond yesterday.
We have scarce seen him since the tift he
had with us the other day. What strange
creatures these men are, even the best of
them! and how light they make of faults
in one another, that shock us but to think
of!</P>
<P>My mother takes his behaviour very ill:
he staid all night with his friend, and return∣ed
to town this morning: he only looked
into my room, to ask me how I did: my
mother was sitting with me. I believe that
hindered him from coming in; for he look∣ed
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
as if he wanted to speak to me. He
bowed to my mother, but said not a word;
he went abroad again as soon as he was dress∣ed,
and did not come in till late. I fear his
conduct will oblige us to separate; for my
mother will not brook any liberties to be
taken with her: she hinted as much, and said
she believed Sir George was tired of living
regularly.</P>
<P>She anticipated the request I intended to
make to her, of letting me go out of town;
for she said, as soon as I was able, I should
remove into the country for a while. Sidney-Castle
is too long a Journey for me at present
to think of undertaking, and she talks of
going into Essex, on a visit to Lady Grim∣ston,
which we have long promised her. I
shall like this better than going down to
Wiltshire, where the want of my Cecilia
would make my old abode a melancholy
place, especially at this juncture.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 4.—Sir George continues sullen
and cold to us: he never has had an oppor∣tunity
of saying any thing particular to me
since the day he said so much. My mother
scarce ever leaves me; he seems nettled at
this. I believe he would endeavour to work
on <HI>me,</HI> as he knows the attempt would be
vain in regard to <HI>her.</HI> As I am now well
enough to receive the visits of our intimate
acquaintance, I am never without company.
I am really in pretty good spirits, and bear
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
my disappointment (as I told you I would)
very handsomely. I never hear Mr. Faulk∣land's
name mentioned, no more than if such
a man did not exist. We are to set out for
lady Grimston's house on Tuesday; it is but
twenty Miles from London; and I am al∣ready
strong enough to bear a longer jour∣ney.</P>
<P>My mother told Sir George, that if he
liked it, the house we are now in was at his
service during her time of it, of which there
are some months to come; for she said
she meant to go directly home from
Essex. Sir George thanked her, but did not
say whether he would accept of her offer or
not.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 5.—I have been obliged to turn
away my poor Ellen. She was so imprudent
as to receive a letter for me from Mr. Faulk∣land's
man, contrary to my mother's express
commands. She brought it to me, and I
gave it to my mother unopened, who put it
directly into the fire without reading it, and
told me it would oblige her, if I would part
with the servant who had presumed to take
it after her prohibition. I instantly obeyed,
and have just discharged her. I should have
a sad loss of her, only I am in hopes of
having her place well supplied by an old ac∣quaintance
and play-fellow of ours, poor
Patty Main; her father is dead, and she is
obliged to go to service, for he has left a
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
widow with six children. The eldest son,
you remember, served his time to his father,
and is just now setting out in business; but a
young surgeon in a country town must take
some time to establish himself; though he is
a very worthy youth, and I hear clever in
his profession.</P>
<P>Patty came to town last week with a lady
from our neighbourhood, who applied to
my mother to recommend the girl to wait on
some person of fashion. My mother has
been looking out for a suitable place for her;
but she told me to-day, she thought I could
not do better than take her to myself; I
shall be very glad to have her, for she is an
amiable young woman.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 6.—We go out of town at seven
o'clock to-morrow morning, as we are to
dine at Grimston-hall, and purpose going at
our leisure. I will steal a few minutes from
sleep, though it is now very late, to give
you a short scene which passed in my cham∣ber
about an hour ago.</P>
<P>Sir George (who, according to his late
custom, had been abroad all day) came into
my room, where my mother and I were sit∣ting
together. He asked us, did we hold
our purpose of going out of town next day?
Yes, certainly, my mother said. And you
intend going from lady Grimston's to Sidney-Castle?
We do. Then, madam (to my
mother), as it is the last trouble you are like∣ly
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
to have from Mr. Faulkland, I hope you
will not refuse to read this letter, which he
has sent you; and he took one out of his
pocket, and presented it to her. She did
not make an offer to receive it, but answered,
Sir George, it is to no purpose for Mr.
Faulkland to sollicit me; you know I don't
easily alter my resolutions when once they are
fixed: he has given himself an unnecessary
trouble; pray excuse me: it was not hand∣some
of him to write to my daughter, after
he knew my sentiments. You need not be
afraid of fresh sollicitations, madam, said my
brother; I knew enough of your <HI>firmness</HI>
(and he spoke the word firmness reluctantly,
as if he would rather use another, perhaps
less respectful term;) I knew enough to as∣sure
Faulkland there was not the least hope
left for him; and though I do not know the
subject of that letter, I can venture to assure
you, it is not intended to move you in fa∣vour
of his pretensions: this he declared to
me, before I would take the letter from him;
but what puts it past doubt, is, that he set
out this very evening from London, in order
to embark for Germany. I could not help
breathing a sigh when Sir George said this;
but no body heard me. He still held the let-letter
in his hand, and again offered it to my
mother; you need not be afraid of it, madam;
I presume it may be no more than to take a
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
civil leave of you. I wish him well, said
my mother, taking the letter; if that be all,
what he says may keep cold; and she put it
into her pocket without opening.</P>
<P>This being the eve of our journey, some
little domestick matters, which my mother
had to settle, called her out of the room.
Sir George took that opportunity to ask me,
whether my mother had shewed me the let∣ter
which he had received from Mr. Faulk∣land
while he was at Bath, relative to that
cursed affair, as he called it. I told him, my
mother had repeated great part of the con∣tents
of it to me; and that the principal ob∣servation
she had made, was not favourable
to <HI>him,</HI> on account of his being made the
confidant of such an affair.</P>
<P>I am very sorry for your sake, Sidney,
said he, that our mother is of so inflexible a
temper; you have lost by it, what you will
have reason to regret as long as you live.
Such amazing obstinacy! such unaccountable
perverseness! I do not want to shake your
filial obedience; but I, for my own part,
think that nothing but infatuation can ac∣count
for your mother's conduct—Does
she want a man without passions? Or have
<HI>you</HI> filled your head with such chimaerical
notions as to—I interrupted him (for my
brother is not always nice in his choice of
words;)—Dear Sir George, say no more;
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
I am very well eontented as I am. I will
not increase your uneasiness, said he, by tell∣ing
you what Faulkland has suffered on this
occasion. If ever love was carried to ado∣ration,
it was in the breast of that generous,
charming fellow—but you have lost him—and
I have lost him; thanks to my wise
scrupulous mother for that. I begged of
him to drop the subject. My mother came
in to us again. Sir George bid us good night,
and wished us a good journey. The part∣ing
was cool enough. I am glad how∣ever,
there is not a total rupture. I believe
he will continue in our house in town for a
time, at least.</P>
<P>Patty Main, who gladly accepted of the
offer of my service, came home to me this
evening. She is grown very tall and genteel.
I hardly know how to treat her as a servant;
but the good girl is so humble, that she
does all in her power to make me forget that
I ever knew her in a better situation; but in
this she fails of her purpose, for it only
serves to remind me the more strongly of
it: she is so ready and so handy, that she
does twenty little offices that do not belong
to her place, and which are not expected of
her. My mother is exceedingly pleased
with her, and says it is such a happiness to
have about me a young person virtuously
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
brought up, that she almost considers her as
one of the family.</P>
<P><HI>Grimston-hall, August</HI> 8.</P>
<P>We arrived here yesterday, and met a
most friendly reception from the lady of this
mansion. But before I say any more of her,
I will hasten to a more interesting subject.
I have got Mr. Faulkland's letter to my mo∣ther;
she has just put it into my hands; and
while she walks in the garden with lady
Grimston, I will made haste to transcribe it.
Thus it is:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I submit to the sentence you have passed
on me. I am miserable, but do not presume to
expostulate. I purpose leaving England di∣rectly;
but would wish, if possible (a little
to mitigate the severity of my lot,) to con∣vince
you, that the unhappy rejected Man,
who aspired to the honour of being your
son-in-law, is not quite such a criminal as he
now appears to you.</P>
<P>To Sir George's friendship I know I am
much indebted for endeavouring to vindi∣cate
me. It was not in his power, it was
not in my own; for you saw all which I, in
unreserved freedom, wrote to him on the
subject of my acquaintance with Miss B.</P>
<P>I have but one resource left; perhaps,
madam, you will think it a strange one.
To the lady herself I must appeal. She
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
will do me justice, and I am sure will be
ready to acknowledge that I am no betrayer
of innocence, no breaker of promises; that
I was surprized into the commission of a
fault, for which I have so dear a price.</P>
<P>Her testimony, madam, may perhaps
have some weight with you; though I pro∣pose
nothing more by it, than that you may
think of me with less detestation. You have
banished me from your presence: I'am a
voluntary exile from my country, and from
my friends: I submit to the chastisement,
and would do any thing to expiate my of∣fence
against you and Miss Bidulph. There
is but <HI>one</HI> command which you can possibly
lay on me, to which I would not pay a per∣fect
and ready obedience; but that act, per∣haps,
is the only one which would make me
appear worthy of your esteem.</P>
<P>The lady whom it has been my ill fate to
render unhappy, and by whom I am made
unutterably so, will, ere long, come to a
house at Putney, which I have taken on
purpose for her. I have placed in it my
housekeeper, a grave worthy woman, under
whose care she will be safe, and attended
with that secrecy and tenderness which her
condition requires.</P>
<P>I have written to her a faithful account of
every thing relative to my hoped-for alliance
with your family, and the occasion of the
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
treaty's being broken off. As she must, by
this means, know that your ladyship is ac∣quainted
with her story, I have told her,
that, perhaps you might, from the interest
you took in her misfortune, be induced to
see her in her retirement. Let me, therefore,
conjure you, madam, by the pious zeal which
governs all your actions, and by the love
you bear that daughter so deservedly dear to
you, to take compassion on this young lady.
She has no friends, nor any acquaintance in
this part of the kingdom; her situation will
require the comfort of society, and perhaps,
the advice of wisdom. It will be an act
worthy of your humanity to shew some
countenance to her.</P>
<P>I think she will be in very good hands
with the honest woman who waits her come∣ing;
but if any thing should happen other∣wise
than well, it would make me doubly
wretched.</P>
<P>To one who has no resources of content∣ment
in her own bosom, solitude cannot be
a friend; this I fear may be the lady's case;
and this makes me with the more earnestness
urge my request to you. Forgive me, ma∣dam,
for the liberty I take with you; a li∣berty,
which, though I confess, it needs an
apology, yet is it at the same time a proof of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he confidence I have in you, which I hope
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
will not affront either your candour or your
virtue.</P>
<P>If you will condescend to grant this re∣quest,
I shall obtain the two wishes at present
most material to my peace; the one to se∣cure
to the lady a compassionate friend, al∣ready
inclined to espouse her cause; the other,
to put it in your power to be satisfied from
the lady's own mouth, of the truth of what
I have asserted. I trust to her generosity to
deal openly on this occasion.</P>
<P>I wish you and Miss Bidulph every bless∣ing
that Heaven can bestow, and am, with
great respect,</P>
<CLOSER>Madam,
Your ladyship's
Most obedient, humble Servant,
<SIGNED>ORLANDO FAULKLAND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>P. S. The lady will go by the name of
Mrs. Jefferis: you will pardon me for not
having mentioned her <HI>real name.</HI> I never
yet told it even to Sir George; but I presume
she will make no secret of it to you, if you
honour her with a visit.</P>
<P>Poor Orlando! unhappy Miss B! I could
name a third person, that is not <HI>happy</HI> nei∣ther.
What a pity it is, that so many good
qualities, should be blotted by imperfections!
how tender is his compassion for this poor
girl! how ingenuous his conduct! but still
he flies from her. I fear she can never hope
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
to recover him. There is but <HI>one</HI> thing, he
says, which <HI>he would not do; the only act,
perhaps, by which he could make himself appear
worthy of my mother's esteem.</HI> The meaning
of this but too plainly shews him determined
against marrying Miss B. I don't know
any thing else which would reconcile my
mother to him.</P>
<P>I make no doubt of her complying with
Mr. Faulkland's request in seeing the lady:
she is very compassionate, particularly to her
own sex.</P>
<P>What a <HI>strange resource</HI> indeed is this of
Mr. Faulkland's, to appeal to the lady her∣self!
what am I to judge from it, but that the
unfortunate victim, ignorant of the treachery
that was practised against her by her wicked
aunt, and that her destroyer paid a <HI>price</HI> for
her dishonour, exculpates him from the worst
part of the guilt, and perhaps, poor easy
creature, blames her own weakness only for
the error which a concealed train of cunning
and perfidy might have led her into?</P>
<P>But even supposing Miss B. were gene∣rous
and candid enough (and great indeed
must be her candour and generosity) to justi∣fy
this guilty man, what would it avail?
Did not my mother tell me she conceived a
<HI>sort of horror at the bare idea of an union be∣tween
Mr. Faulkland and me?</HI> This arises
from the strong impression made on her by
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
the unlucky event which blasted her own early
love. Strong and early prejudices are almost
insurmountable.</P>
<P>My mother's piety, genuine and rational
as it is, is notwithstanding a little tinctured
with superstition; it was the error of her
education, and her good sense has not been
able to surmount it; so that I know the uni∣verse
would not induce her to change her re∣solution
in regard to Mr. Faulkland. She
thinks he <HI>ought</HI> to marry Miss B, and she
will <HI>ever</HI> think so. I wish he would; for I
am sure he never can be mine. The bell
rings for breakfast; I must run down. My
mother came up to dress just now, and step∣ped
into my room. I returned her the let∣ter,
and she asked me, what I thought of
Mr. Faulkland's request? Madam, you are
a better judge of the propriety of it than I
am. I shall have no objection to seeing the
unhappy lady, said she, since it seems he has
apprised her of my knowledge of her affairs.
I am glad he has the grace to shew even so
much compassion for her: perhaps it may
be the beginning of repentance, and time
may work a thorough reformation in him, if
God spares him his life and his <HI>senses.</HI> You
see which way my good mother's thoughts
tended. I did not, she added, intend to re∣turn
to London again; but this occasion, I
think, calls upon me; and I believe I shall
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
go for a while, in order to see and comfort
this poor young creature. She cannot yet
be near lying in; and I suppose she will not
come to the house Mr. Faulkland speaks of,
'till she can no longer remain undiscovered
at home; so that a month or two hence will
be full soon enough for me to think of going
to town.</P>
<P>I saw my mother rested her compliance
with Mr. Faulkland's request, merely on
one point; that of compassion to the girl.
As for the other motive, said she, the hear∣ing
him justified from the <HI>Lady's own mouth,</HI>
I am not such a novice in those matters, but
that I know when a deluding man has once
got an ascendency over a young creature, he
can coax her into any thing. Too much truth
I doubt there is in this observation of my
mother's.</P>
<P>But it is time to say something of lady
Grimston. My Cecilia has never seen her,
though I believe she has often heard my mo∣ther
speak of her. They are nearly of an
age, and much of the same cast of thinking;
though with this difference, that lady Grim∣ston
is extravagantly rigid in her notions, and
precise in her manner. She has been a wi∣dow
for many years, and lives upon a large
jointure at Grimston-hall, with as much re∣gularity
and solemnity, as you would see in a
monastery. Her servants are all antediluvi∣ans;
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
I believe her coach-horses are fifty
years of age, and the very house-dog is as
grey as a badger. She herself, who in her
youth never <HI>could</HI> have been handsome, ren∣ders
herself still a more unpleasing figure, by
the oddity of her dress; you would take
her for a lady of Charles the first's court at
least. She is always dressed out: I believe
she sleeps in her cloaths, for she comes down
ruffled, and towered, and flounced, and
fardingaled, even to breakfast. My mother
has a very high opinion of her, and says,
she <HI>knows more of the world</HI> than any one of
her acquaintance. It may be so; but it
must be of the old world; for lady Grim∣ston
has not been ten miles from her seat these
thirty years. 'Tis nine years since my mo∣ther
and she met before, and there was a
world of compliments passed between them;
though I am sure they were sincerely glad to
see each other, for they seem to be very fond.
They were companions in youth, that sea∣son
wherein the most durable friendships are
contracted. I believe her really a very good
woman; she is pious and charitable, and
does abundance of good things in her neigh∣bourhood;
though I cannot say, I think
her amiable. There is an austerity about her
that keeps me in awe, notwithstanding that
she is extremely obliging to me, and told my
mother, I <HI>promised to make a fine woman.</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
Think of such a compliment to one of al∣most
nineteen. My mother and she call
one another by their christian names; and
you would smile to hear the two old ladies
(begging their pardons). <HI>Lettying</HI> and
<HI>Dollying</HI> one another. This accounts to me
for Lady Grimston's think <HI>me</HI> still a child;
for I suppose she considers herself not much
past girlhood, though, to do her justice, she
has not a scrap of it in her behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 10.—All our motions here are
as regular as the clock. The family rise at
six; we are summoned to breakfast at eight;
at ten a venerable congregation are assembled
to prayers, which an antient clergyman,
who is curate of the parish, and her lady∣ship's
chaplain, gives us daily. Then the
old horses are put to the old coach; and
my lady, with her guests, if they chuse it,
take an airing; always going and returning
by the same road, and driving precisely to
the same land-mark, and no farther. At
half an hour after twelve, in a hall large
enough to entertain a corporation, we sit
down to dinner; my lady has a grace of a
quarter of an hour long, and we are waited
on by four truly venerable footmen, for she
likes state. The afternoon we may dispose
of as we please; at least it is a liberty I am
indulged in, and I generally spend my time
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
in the garden, or my own chamber, 'till I
have notice given me of supper's being on
the table, where we are treated with the
same ceremonials as at dinner. At ten ex∣actly,
the instant the clock strikes the first
stroke, my lady rises with great solemnity,
and wishes us a good night.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 14.—You cannot expect, in
such a house as this is, my dear, that I can
be furnished with materials to give you much
variety. Indeed these four last days have
been so exactly the same in every particular,
excepting that the dishes at dinner and sup∣per
were changed, that I had resolved to
hang up my pen 'till I quitted Grimston-hall,
or at least resign it to Patty, and let her plod
on and tell you how the wind blew such a
day; what sort of a mantua lady Grimston
had on such a day (though by the way it is al∣ways
the same, always ash-coloured tissue);
what the great dog barked at, at such an
hour, and what the old parrot said at such a
time; the house and the garden I have ex∣hausted
my descriptive faculties on already,
though they are neither of them worth de∣scribing;
and I was beginning to despair of
matter to furnish out a quarter of an hour's
entertainment, when the scene began to
brighten a little this auspicious day, by the
arrival of a coach full of visitors. These
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
were no other than a venerable dean, who
is the minister of our parish, his lady and
daughter, and a Mr. Arnold, a gentleman
who is a distant relation of lady Grimston's.
He has a house in this neighbourhood, and
is just come to an estate by the death of his
elder brother.</P>
<P>This visit has given me hopes that I may
now-and-then have a chance for seeing a hu∣man
face, besides the antiques of the family,
and those which are depicted on the arras.
Though, not to disparage the people, they
were all agreeable enough in their different
ways. The old dean is good humoured
and polite; I mean the true politeness, that
of the heart, which dictates the most o∣bliging
things in so frank a manner, that they
have not the least appearance of flattery.
Being very near sighted, he put on a pair
of spectacles to look at me, and turning to
Mr. Arnold, with a vivacity that would have
become five-and-twenty, he repeated</P>
<Q><L>“With an air and a face,</L>
<L>And a shape and a grace, &amp;c.”</L></Q>
<P>The young man smiled his assent, and my
mother looked so delighted, that the good-natured
dean's compliment pleased <HI>me</HI> for
<HI>her</HI> sake. Lady Grimston, who is passio∣nately
fond of musick, has a very pretty
organ in one of her chambers; Mr. Arnold
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
was requested to give us a lesson on it,
which he very readily obliged us with. He
plays ravishingly; the creature made me
envious, he touched it so admirably. I had
taken a sort of dislike to him when he first
came in, I cannot tell why or wherefore;
but this accomplishment has reconciled me
so to him, that I am half in love with him.
I hope we shall see him often; he is really
excellent on this instrument, and you know
how fond I am of musick.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 15.—This packet is already so
large that I am sure it will frighten you. I
will therefore send it off before I encrease it;
especially as I am so now much in the hum∣drum
way, that I ought, out of policy, to
make a break in my narrative, in order to
encourage you to read it. Positively, if
things do not mend, and that considerably
too,—Patty shall keep the Journal, for I
find myself already disposed to sleep over it.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 20.—I have looked over what
Patty has writ for the five last days; upon my
word she is a very good journalist, as well as
amanuensis; and she has given you, to the
full, as good an account of matters and
things as I could.</P>
<P>My time passes rather more tolerably than
I expected. The dean's family seem to
have broke the solitary <HI>spell</HI> that hung over
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
the house, and we have company you see
every day. Mr. Arnold never fails. I al∣ways
make him play; he is very obliging,
and, if he were not good-natured, I should
tire him.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 22.—I have had a letter from Sir Geo.
he mentions not Mr. Faulkland; I too am en∣deavouring
to forget him. When my mother
goes to London, I will try to prevail on her to
let me go down to Sidney-castle. I have no
inclination to go to town, and less to stay
here. We are to have a concert to-morrow,
at Mr. Arnold's house. My lively good
old dean touches the bass viol, his daughter
sings prettily; I am to bear my part too;
so that we begin to grow a little sociable.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 30.—Are you not tired of my
Grimston journal, my Cecilia? Day after
day rolls on, and the same dull repetition!
Lady Grimston, the Dean, and Mr. Arnold,
perpetually! there is no bearing this, you
cry. Well but here is a new personage ar∣rived
to diversify the scene a little. Lady
Grimston's daughter, a sweet woman; but
her mother does not seem fond of her. It
amazes me, for she is perfectly amiable,
both in temper and person; she is a widow
of about eight and twenty. Lady Grimston
appears to treat her with a distance very un∣maternal;
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
and the poor young woman seems
so humbled, that I pity her. She is come
but on a visit, and we shall lose her in a
week, for which I am very sorry, as I have
taken a fancy to her.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1.—Poor Mrs. Vere! that
is the name of Lady Grimston's daughter.
I can now give you the cause of her mother's
coldness to her; I had it from herself; she
told me her little history this evening in the
garden, with a frankness that charmed me.</P>
<P>How happy you are, dear Miss Bidulph,
said she! you seem to be blessed with one
of the tenderest of parents. I am indeed,
I answered; she is one of the best of mo∣thers,
and the best of women. She sighed,
and a tear started into her eye; I too was
happy once, said she, when my indulgent
father lived. I hope, madam, Lady Grim∣ston
is to you, what my good mother is to
me. She shook her head: No, Miss Bi∣dulph,
it must be but too obvious to you that
she is not. I should not have introduced
the subject, if the cold severity of her looks
were not so apparent that you must have
taken notice of them. My mother is, un∣doubtedly,
a very good woman; and you
may naturally suppose, that my conduct
has been such as to deserve her frowns; I
will therefore tell you my melancholy,
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
though short story. It is now about twelve
years since Mr. Vere paid his addresses to
me. He was the eldest son of a gentleman
of family and fortune, who then lived in
this country. I was about sixteen, and the
darling of my father; who was perhaps the
more indulgent to me, as he knew my mo∣ther's
severity. Mr. Vere was but two
years older than myself, and a childish court∣ship
had gone on for some time between us,
before it was suspected by any body; and
to say the truth, before I was well aware of
the consequences myself. It happened, that
an elderly gentleman of a great estate, just
at that time saw and liked me, and directly
made proposals to my mother, as she was
well known to hold the reins of government
in her family.</P>
<P>This offer, I suppose, was advantageous;
for she immediately consulted my father up∣on
it, or rather gave him to understand that
she meant to dispose of her daughter in mar∣riage.</P>
<P>My father, who had no objection to the
match, told her he was very well satisfied,
provided I liked the gentleman; but said,
he hoped she would not think of putting
any force on my inclinations. My eldest
sister had been married some time before by
my mother's sole authority, and quite con∣trary
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
to her own liking; the marriage had
not turned out happily, and my father
was resolved not to have me sacrificed in
the same way.</P>
<P>My mother told him, she was sorry he
had such romantic notions, as to think a
girl of my age capable of having any ideas
of preference for one man more than an∣other;
that she took it for granted I had ne∣ver
presumed to entertain a thought of any
man as yet, and supposed her precepts had
not been so far thrown away upon me, as
that I could let it enter into my head that any
thing but paternal authority was to guide
me in my choice.</P>
<P>My father, from the gentleness of his na∣ture,
had been so accustomed to acquiesce,
that he made no other reply than to bid my
mother use her discretion. He came di∣rectly
to me notwithstanding, and told me
what had passed. It was then, for the first
time, that I discovered I loved Mr. Vere.
I burst into tears, and clinging round my
father's neck, begged of him to save me
from my mother's rigour. My gesture
and words were too passionate for him not
to perceive, that there was something more
at my heart than mere dislike of the old
man. He charged me to deal sincerely. I
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
loved him too well, and was myself too
frank to do otherwise. In short, I confessed
my inclination for Mr. Vere, and his affecti∣on
for me.</P>
<P>Though my kind father chid me gently for
admitting a lover without his or my mother's
approbation, yet at the same time he told
me, he would endeavour to dissuade her
from prosecuting the other match; though
he could wish, he said, I would try to
bring myself to accept of it; adding he
was afraid my mother would be much in∣censed
by a denial.</P>
<P>My mother was fond of grandeur; and
would not like to have me marry any one,
who could not at once make me mistress of
a fine house, and fine Garden, and fine
equipage; which I knew I must not expect
to be the case with Mr. Vere. His father
had several children, and was very frugal in
his temper: besides, as he was but of the
middle age, and of a very healthy consti∣tution,
his son's prospect of possessing the
estate, was to all human appearance, at a very
great distance.</P>
<P>These discouragements, however, did
not hinder me from indulging my wishes.
My father's tenderness was the foundation
on which I built my hopes. I told Mr.
Vere the designs of one parent, and the kind
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
condescension of the other. Emboldened
by this information, he ventured to disclose
his love to my father, begging his interest
with my mother in his favour. He had a
great kindness for the youth, and was so
fond of me, that he would readily have
consented to my happiness, if the fear of
disobliging my mother had not checked
him. He represented to her in the mildest
manner, the utter dislike I had expressed of the
proposed match, and conjured her not to in∣sist
on it. My mother, unused to be controul∣ed,
was filled with resentment both against him
and me; she said, he encouraged me in my dis∣obedience;
and that, if he did not unite
his authority to her's, in order to compel
me to marry the gentleman she approved
of, it would make a total breach between
them.</P>
<P>My good father, who loved my mother
exceedingly, was alarmed at this menace.
Unwilling to come to extremities either with
her or me, he was at a loss how to act. His
paternal love at length prevailed, and he
determined, at all events, to save me from
the violence which he knew would be put
upon my heart.</P>
<P>My mother had never condescended to
talk to me on the subject: she thought my
immediate obedience ought to have follow∣ed
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
the bare knowledge of her will. She
forbad me her sight, and charged me never
to appear before her, 'till I came with a de∣termination
to obey her.</P>
<P>However severe this prohibition was, I
yielded to it with the less reluctance, as my
father's tender love made me amends for
my mother's harshness. Perhaps, had she
vouchsafed to reason a little with me, tem∣pering
her arguments with a motherly kind∣ness,
she would have found me as flexible
as she could wish; but the course she took
had a very contrary effect. I thought my∣self
persecuted, and that it was for the ho∣nour
of my love to persevere. On the
other hand, my father's secret indulgence
encouraged me in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sentiments I entertain∣ed,
and I now determined, not only to re∣fuse
my old lover, but to have my young
one.</P>
<P>My mother had given me a stated time
in which I was to come to a resolution, and
if I did not, at the expiration of it, acqui∣esce,
I was to be pronounced a reprobate,
and to be no more considered as her child. In
this emergency I had recourse to my father.
I told him there was nothing which I was
not ready to suffer, rather than marry the
man I hated: my greatest affliction was the
uneasiness I saw him endure on my account;
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
for my mother reproached him daily with
my obstinacy.</P>
<P>My father said, he thought the alternative
offered by my mother, was to be avoided
but in one way, and that was by marrying
Mr. Vere; for, added he, when she finds
you resolute in your refusal of her choice,
not even my paternal authority will be able
to screen you from her severity, and your
life will be made miserable, without your
father's being able to relieve you. On the
other hand, when you are out of her house,
she cannot distress you, nor prevent me
from doing you the justice which I owe my
child. Nay, possibly in time, I may be
able to work out a reconciliation between
you; but she must not know that I was
consenting to this marriage, lest an irrecon∣cileable
quarrel should ensue. I fell at my
father's feet, and embraced his knees, for
this tender and unexpected proof of his af∣fection.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere's father was no stranger to his
son's attachment, and we were very sure he
would readily come into the proposal which
my father intended to make.</P>
<P>The two parents had a meeting secretly,
where all terms of portion and settlement
were speedily and privately adjusted. Mr.
Vere the father, who had been long intimate
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
in our family, knew very well the necessity
there was for keeping the secret. After
this, my lover and I were to be married
privately, without the knowledge, seeming∣ly,
of any one in either family, excepting
one of the Miss Veres, who was to be pre∣sent;
and when the time of my probation
was expired, my father was to let my mo∣ther
into the knowledge of this affair, as a
thing he had just discovered; and to pacify
her anger as well as he could.</P>
<P>Every thing was conducted in the manner
proposed. I was married with the utmost
privacy, and continued in my father's house
'till the day arrived, when I was to give my
definitive answer.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for me, my mother chose
to receive it from my own mouth, and call∣ed
me into her presence. I appeared before
her trembling and terrified: I had not seen
her for a fortnight, and I was in dread, lest
the discovery I had to make, should banish
me her sight perhaps for ever, unless my
father might influence her in time to forgive
me. She asked me, with a stern brow,
What I had resolved on? I had not courage
to make her an answer, but burst into tears.
She repeated her question; and I could only
reply, Madam, it is not in my <HI>power</HI> to
obey you. She did not comprehend the
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
meaning of my words, but imputing them
to obstinacy, commanded me to leave the
room, and not to see her face 'till I came to
a proper sense of my duty; at the same
time ordering me into my chamber, where
I was to be locked up.</P>
<P>I flew to my father, and conjured him to
let my mother know the truth at once, that I
might no longer be subject to such harsh treat∣ment;
for I knew the being sent home to
my husband would be the consequence of her
being told that I had one.</P>
<P>My poor father was almost afraid to un∣dertake
the task, though he had been the
chief promoter of my marriage, and his au∣thority
ought to have given sanction to it.
He ventured however to let her know, that
I had confessed to him what my fears of her
immediate resentment would not suffer me
to discover whilst I was in her presence;
and what my aversion to the man she pro∣posed
to me, and the rigours I had been
threatened with, if I refused him, had dri∣ven
me to. The rage my mother flew into,
was little short of phrenzy, and my father
made haste to send me out of the house.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere's whole family received me
with great tenderness; but I was sorry at
leaving my father, whose visits to me were
made but seldom, and even those by stealth.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120"/>
My situation, though I was united to the
man I loved, and caressed by all his family,
was far from being happy. My mother's
inflexible temper was not to be wrought
upon, notwithstanding my father did his ut∣most
to prevail on her to see and to forgive
me; and she carried her resentment so far,
that she told my father, unless he cut me off
entirely in his will, she was determined to
separate herself totally from him. This
was an extremity he by no means expected
she would have gone to.</P>
<P>In a fit of sickness, which had seized him
a few years before, he had left me ten
thousand pounds; five of this he had se∣cretly
transferred to Mr. Vere on the day
of my marriage, and had promised him to
bequeath me five more at his death.</P>
<P>In consequence of this disposition, he pur∣posed
making a new will, so that he the less
scrupled giving my mother up the old
one, with a promise of making another a∣greeable
to her request.</P>
<P>My mother's jointure was already settled
on her; my eldest sister had received her
portion; so that there was little bequeathed
by this testament, but my fortuue, and a
few other small legacies.</P>
<P>My mother tore the will with indignati∣on,
and not satisfied with my father's pro∣mise,
insisted on his putting it into executi∣on
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
immediately. In short, his easy temper
yielded to her importunities, and he had a will
drawn up by her instructions, in which I was
cutoff with one shilling, and my intended for∣tune
bequeathed to my eldest sister. My mo∣ther
was made residuary legatee to everything
that should remain, after paying all the be∣quests.
This would have amounted to a
considerable sum, if the half of my portion,
which was already paid without her know∣ledge,
had not made such a dimunition in
the personal estate, that after paying my
sister the whole of what was specified in
the will, there was scarce any thing likely to
remain.</P>
<P>Had my mother known this secret, she
would not perhaps have been so ready to
have made my father devise all my intended
fortune to my sister. My father who was
aware of this, durst not however inform
her at that juncture, how much she hurt
herself, by forcing him to such measures.
She insisted upon his leaving the whole of
what he designed for me to my eldest sister;
as well to convince him, she said, that she
had no self-interested views, as to be an ex∣ample
to other rebellious children.</P>
<P>My father had no remedy on these occasi∣ons,
but a patient acquiescence: the will
was made, and my mother herself would
keep it.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="122"/>
My father took an opportunity the same
day to inform me what he had done, but
assured me, he would immediately make an∣other
will, agreeable to his first intenti∣ons,
and leave it in the hands of a faithful
friend.</P>
<P>This was his design; but! alas he lived not
to execute it. He was seized that night with
a paralytic disorder, which at once deprived
him of the use of his limbs and his speech.
They who were about him believe he retain∣ed
his senses, but he was not capable of
making himself understood even by signs.
Alarmed with this dismal account of my
beloved father's situation, I flew to the house
without considering my mother's displea∣sure;
but I was not permitted to see him.
I filled the house with my cries, but to no
purpose; I had not the satisfaction of re∣ceiving
even a farewell look from him,
which was all he was capable of bestowing
on me.</P>
<P>He languished for several days in this me∣lancholy
condition, and then, in spite of the
aid of physic, expired.</P>
<P>The loss of this dear father so entirely
took up my thoughts, that I never reflected
on the loss of the remaining part of my
fortune; but it was not so with my father-in-law.
There had been a settlement made
on me in consequence of the fortune ▪pro∣mised;
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
though not equal to what it de∣manded,
yet superior to the half which was
paid. He relied on my father's word for the
remainder, and had no doubt of its being
secured to him, knowing his circumstances,
as well as his strict integrity, and that my sis∣ter
had actually received the same fortune
which I was promised.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere had four daughters, and it was
on this fortune he chiefly depended to provide
for them.</P>
<P>The news of my being cut off with a
shilling exceedingly surprized and exasperated
him. Unluckily I had not mentioned to
him, nor even to my husband, the will
which my father had been obliged to make.
The assurances he gave me, of immediately
making another in my favour, prevented me;
as I thought it would only be a very severe
proof of my mother's enmity to the family,
which I could have wished to conceal from
them; especially as I did not imagine it
would have affected me afterwards. Mr.
Vere the elder was from home when my fa∣ther
died, and his business detained him for
more than a month after his funeral was
over. My husband, on this occasion, shew∣ed
the tender and disinterested love he bore
me; he affected to make as light as possible
of this unexpected disappointment, but at
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
the same time expressed his uneasiness, left
his father should carry matters to an extremity
with my mother, from whom we knew we
were to expect nothing by mild methods.</P>
<P>It was now thought adviseable, that I
should write to my mother, to condole with
her on my father's death; again to intreat
her forgiveness of my fault, and, as some
mitigation of it, to acknowledge that it was
not only with my father's privity, but even
with his consent and approbation, that I had
married.</P>
<P>I wrote this letter in a strain of the utmost
humility, without mentioning a word of my
fortune; <HI>that</HI> I thought it would be time
enough for me to do, if I could prevail on
my mother to see me, and would at all events
come better from my husband or his father,
than from me. But I gained nothing by
this, only some unkind reflections on my
father's memory, and a message, that since
he thought proper to marry his daughter in
a manner so highly disagreeable to her mo∣ther,
he should have taken care of providing
for her; as he could not expect a parent, so
disobliged as she had been, would take any
notice of me.</P>
<P>My mother had been left sole executrix to
my father's forced will; and she took care
to put my sister, and the other legatees, into
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
possession of what was bequeathed to
them, in a very short time after his de∣cease.
She found there was an unexpected
deficiency in his personal fortune, inso∣much
that there was barely enough to
pay his debts; and that her being left the
residue, after the specified legacies were paid,
amounted to nothing. On the contrary,
had my father's just intentions taken place,
in leaving me five thousand pounds, she
would have come in for the other five;
but the whole ten thousand now went to my
sister,</P>
<P>She was not long however at a loss to know
how this came to pass. Mr. Vere determined
to assert his own, and his son's right; and
being exceedingly provoked at my mother's
behaviour, wrote to her immediately on his
return home; and having informed her of
the settlement made on me, on account of
the fortune already paid, and what was far∣ther
agreed on to be paid by my father, told
her, he expected that this promise should be
punctually fulfilled. He said, he knew she
had it in her power to do this; and since it
was by her contrivance I had been robbed of
my just right, if honour, and the duty of a
parent, would not induce her to make me
proper amends, she must excuse him, if he
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
made use of such means as the laws allowed
him, in order to compel her.</P>
<P>Such a letter, to a woman of my mother's
temper, met with such a reception as might
be expected. She tore it before his mes∣senger's
face; and desired him to tell his
master, that as what he had already obtained
was by fraud, so he was at liberty to make
use of force to recover the remainder; but
with her consent, he never should have a
single shilling.</P>
<P>This exasperating reply, made my father-in-law
directly commence a suit against her,
in which the other legatees were made par∣ties.
The distress I felt on this occasion is
scarce to be imagined; the breach was now
so widened between my mother and my hus∣band's
family, that there remained not the
least hope of its ever being closed. Mr.
Vere unwillingly joined with his father in
pursuit of these measures. He would for
my sake much rather have yielded up his ex∣pectations,
than supported them at the ex∣pence
of my quiet; but his father's will, and
justice to the rest of the family, compelled
him to proceed, and deprived me of any
pretence for interposing.</P>
<P>The law-suit was carrying on with great
acrimony on both sides, when an event hap∣pened,
that made me then, and has indeed
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
ever since, look with indifference on every
thing in this life; it was the death of my
husband. He was snatched from me by a
violent fever, before he reached his twentieth
year.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to describe my suffer∣ings
to you on this sad occasion; they were
aggravated by my being near the time of ly∣ing-in.</P>
<P>Whatever affliction Mr. Vere felt for the
death of his only son, it did not make him
forgetful of what he owed his daughters; and
he was resolved to carry on the law-suit with
the utmost vigour.</P>
<P>You may suppose the house wherein I had
lost a beloved husband appeared a dismal
place to me, especially in my present situa∣tion.
I thought too, my father's looks be∣gan
to grow colder to me than they used to
be; and I begged I might have his permis∣sion
to remove for a while. He did not
oppose it, and I went, at the pressing in∣treaties
of your favourite, the good old dean,
to his house; where he and his lady behaved
to me with more than parental tenderness.
My health was in so declining a way, that
this worthy man (as I have since learned)
made several applications to my mother to
see me, but without success. At length the
hour of my delivery arrived, and I was
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
brought to-bed of a dead female child. The
estate, in case of Mr. Vere's dying without
issue, devolved on his sisters; and I was in
hopes this circumstance, so favourable to the
young ladies, would have induced their fa∣ther
to have been less rigorous in persisting
in his claim. But in this I was deceived;
he loved money, and was besides full of re∣sentment
against my mother. I thought how∣ever
of an expedient, which I flattered my∣self
might work upon him; and by good for∣tune
it succeeded.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere, though I had left his house,
visited me constantly, and kept up a shew
of tenderness, which I am sure he had not
in his heart. I told him one day, whilst I
was still confined to my bed, that as I had
now lost both my husband and my child, a
very moderate income would be sufficient for
me; and that as I valued my mother's peace
of mind, beyond any selfish consideration,
I was very willing to give up half my join∣ture,
provided he would drop his suit.
Mr. Vere seemed surprized at the pro∣posal:
he said, he wondered I could be
so blind to my own interest, and that all
he was doing was purely for my sake.
I thanked him for his pretended friend∣ship,
but assured him, he could serve me
no way so effectually, as by coming into
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
the measure I proposed. Mr. Vere said, I
talked like a child; but he would consider of
it. The following day he called on me
again, and told me, that to make me easy,
he was willing to come into my proposal; that
he would have the proper instruments drawn,
by which I was to relinquish half my jointure;
and he in consequence to give up all claim on
my father's estate.</P>
<P>I was much better pleased, at this losing
agreement, than if I had acquired a large ac∣cession
of fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Vere soon got the proper deeds ready,
and they were executed in form.</P>
<P>I now relapsed into an illness, from which
I was supposed to have been quite recovered,
and my life was thought in great danger. I
have since been told, that Mr. Vere repented
his agreement at that juncture, and told some
of his friends, that if he had not been so
hasty, he should have had a chance for my
jointure and my fortune too.</P>
<P>I begged of the dean to go to my mother,
and use his last efforts on her, to prevail with
her to see and forgive me before I died; at
the same time, I sent her the release I had
procured from Mr. Vere, which I knew was
the most acceptable present I could make her.
The dean urged the danger I was in, without
its seeming to make much impression on her.
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
I am willing to believe, that she thought the
dean exaggerated in his account of my ill∣ness.
He owned to me himself, that he
was shocked to find her so obdurate. At
length, he took the paper out of his pocket,
and presenting it to her, I am sorry, madam,
said he, I cannot prevail upon you to act
like a parent or a christian; your daughter I
fear will not survive her present malady; but
she will have the comfort to consider, that
she has left nothing unattempted to obtain
that forgiveness, which you so cruelly deny
her. I hope, lady Grimston, your last hours
may be as peaceful, as her's I trust will be
from this reflection. There, madam—she
has by that instrument left you disengaged
from a troublesome and vexatious law-suit,
that would, if pursued, infallibly turn out to
your disadvantage; it was all she <HI>could</HI> do,
and what few children, used like her, <HI>would</HI>
have done.</P>
<P>My mother, a good deal alarmed at the
dean's manner of speaking, now examined
the contents of the paper. She seemed af∣fected,
and called him back, as he was just
leaving the room. She told him, she was
not lost to the feelings of nature; and that
if he thought her presence would contri∣bute
to ease my mind of the remorse it must
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
needs labour under, she was not against see∣ing
me.</P>
<P>The good man, glad to find her in this
yielding disposition, told her she could not
too soon execute her intention; and pressed
her to come to his house directly. She suf∣fered
him to put her into his coach, and he
carried her home with him. The interview,
on my side, was attended with tears of joy,
tenderness, and contrition. My mother did
not depart from her usual austerity; she gave
me but her hand to kiss, and pronounced her
forgiveness and her blessing in so languid a
manner, as greatly damped the fervour of my
joy.</P>
<P>She staid with me not more than a quar∣ter
of an hour, and having talked of indif∣ferent
things, without once so much as men∣tioning
what I had done, she took a cold and
formal leave.</P>
<P>This interview, as little cordial as my
mother's behaviour was to me, had so good
an effect on me, that I began perceptibly
to mend from that hour. She sent indeed
constantly to enquire how I did; but avoid∣ed
coming, lest, as she said, she should meet
with Mr. Vere, whom she could never for∣give.
As soon as I was in a condition to go
abroad, I went to pay my duty to her. She
received me with civility, but no tenderness;
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
nor has she ever from that time made me
the least recompence for what I have lost;
her permitting me to see her, she thinks suf∣ficient
amends.</P>
<P>I did not chuse to return to Mr. Vere's
house, as I had only a polite, not a kind in∣vitation.
One of his daughters, she who
had been present at my marriage, and who
always had shewn most affection towards me,
was about this time married to a gentleman,
whose estate lay in another county. When the
bride went home, she pressed me to go with
her so warmly, that I could not refuse her;
and during the time I staid with her, I re∣ceived
so many marks of tenderness from
her, that I resolved to settle in her neigh∣bourhood;
and have now a little house near
her, where I have resided constantly ever
since. I come once or twice a year to pay
a visit to my mother, but my reception, as
you may see, is always cold, and I seldom
stay more than a few days,</P>
<P>Old Mr. Vere is dead; and his daughters,
who were coheiresses to his estate, are all
married, so that the family is intirely dis∣persed;
but notwithstanding this, and the
number of years that have passed ever since
my marriage, my mother cannot yet endure
the name of the family: and always, as you
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
may have observed, calls me by my maiden
name.</P>
<P>I was much affected at the story of the
amiable Mrs. Vere. The sweet melancholy,
which predominates in her countenance, shews
that the spirits, when broken in the bud of
youth, are hardly to be recovered. What a
tyrant this lady Grimston is! I did not ad∣mire
her before, but I now absolutely dislike
her. What a wife and a mother has she
been to a husband and a daughter, who
might have constituted the happiness of a
woman of a different temper! And yet she
passes for a wonderful good woman, and a
pattern of all those virtues of a religion,
which meekness and forgiveness characterise.
She is mistaken, if she thinks that austerity
is necessary to christianity. The most that
my charity allows me to believe of such
people is, that they impose on <HI>themselves,</HI> at
a time when the most discerning perhaps
think that they are endeavouring to impose
on others.</P>
<P>What an angel is my good mother, when
compared to this her friend, whom her hu∣mility
makes her look upon as her superior
in virtue! I am very angry with Sir George,
who in his resentment said to me once, that
she was like lady Grimston. I then knew
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
but little of that lady's character, or I should
have reproved him for it.</P>
<P>I conjured Mrs. Vere to make her visit
longer than she had at first intended. She
told me, she would most gladly do it; but
that it was a liberty she did not dare to take,
unless her mother asked her to prolong it;
which, she said, she possibly might do, in
complaisance to me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 4.—My mother I find has
made lady Grimston her confident in relation
to my affairs; the dear woman never keeps
her mind to herself on any subject. Lady
Grimston highly applauds her conduct in that
business; and bestowed a few civil words on
me for my filial duty, intermixed with an
ungrateful comparison of her own daughter's
behaviour. And she condoled with herself,
by saying, that <HI>good parents</HI> had not always
<HI>good children.</HI> She told my mother, that she
wished to see the child (meaning me) hap∣pily
disposed of; for that, notwithstanding
the prudence of my behaviour, the world
would be apt to cast reflections on me, on
account of the abruptness with which the
match was broken off, without the true rea∣sons
being known: and my illness, she said,
might be imputed to the disappointment;
which might incline people to suspect the
rejection had been on Mr. Faulkland's side.
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
What a provoking hint was this my dear!
it has really alarmed my mother, who
depends much on the judgment of her
friend, and has at the same time so nice a
regard to the honour of her family. I wish
that formal old woman would mind her own
business.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 6.—My mother and lady
Grimston have had abundance of private
confabulation these two days, from which
Mrs. Vere and I am excluded. I wish there
may not be some mischief a brewing. One
thing, however, has given me pleasure; la∣dy
Grimston has invited her daughter to stay
at Grimston-hall as long as my mother and I
continue here.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vere tells me, she suspects the
subject of their conferences; but she is per∣verse,
and will not tell me what she thinks,
for fear, as she says, she should have guess∣ed
wrong, and her surmises would only teaze
me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 10.—A packet sent me
from London—A letter from Sir George—one
from my Cecilia—and so soon too! Wel∣come,
welcome, thou faithful messenger, from
the faithfullest of hearts!</P>
<P>Thou dear anticipating little prophetess!
What put it into your head to call Mr. Ar∣nold
a new conquest, upon my but barely
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
mentioning him to you? I was just going
to tell you all; and behold your own whim∣sical
imagination has suggested the most ma∣terial
part to you already. You desire me to
be sincere: was that necessary, my sister,
from <HI>you</HI> to <HI>me?</HI> You say, you are <HI>sure Mr.
Arnold is, or will be my lover;</HI> and insist on
my being more particular in my description
of him. What a strange girl you are! again
I ask you, What put this into your head?
What busy little spirit of intelligence flew
to you with this news before I knew it
myself? For as to the fact, it is but too
certain.</P>
<P>This has been the subject of my mother's
and lady Grimston's private conferences;
and Mrs. Vere (sly thing as she is) guessed
it. It seems Mr. Arnold disclosed his pas∣sion
to lady Grimston, in order to ask her
advice about it. She loves mightily to be
consulted; and ill-starred as I am, did me
the honour to recommend me strongly to
him; and she has prepossessed my mother
too in favour of this new man. I wish the
meddling old dame had been dumb. Now
shall I go through another fiery tryal! Hea∣ven
help me, if lady Grimston were to be
my judge! But my mother is all good∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137"/>
Well, but you want a description of this
man. I will give it you, though I have scarce
patience to write about him. Indeed, Cecilia,
I am vexed; I foresee a great deal of trouble
from that quarter.—But come, I will try
what I can say.</P>
<P>The man is about thirty, genteel, and
handsome enough; at least he is reckoned
so, and I believe I should think him so, if I
were not angry with him. He is very like
your brother Henry; and you know he is an
allowed handsome man. He seems to have
plain good sense, and is good humoured, I
believe: I do not know of what colour his
eyes are, for I never looked much at him.
Lady Grimston says he is a <HI>scholar</HI> (a thing
she pretends to value highly), and a mighty
sober, pious, worthy gentleman. He is of
a very good family; and has an estate of
about fifteen hundred pounds a year, upon
which there is a jointure of three hundred
pounds a year, paid to his brother's widow.
Part of the estate is in Kent, and part in this
county of Essex, where he has a mansion-house,
a well enough looking old-fashioned
place, something in the Grimston-hall stile,
at about a mile distance from this; where he
passes most of his time.</P>
<P>I have told you already, he plays divinely
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
on several instruments; this is the only cir∣cumstance
about him that pleases me.</P>
<P>He has not yet made his addresses to
me in form; yet we all know that he in∣tends
it, from his uncommon assiduity to∣wards
me; but he has a sort of reserve a∣bout
him, and loves to do every thing in his
own way.</P>
<P>Bless me!—here he is—his chariot has just
driven into the court; and Mrs. Vere peeps
in upon me, and with a most vexatious arch∣ness,
bids me come down to the parlour;
but I will not, unless my mother desires me.
I will go into the garden, to be for a while
out of the way.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 11.—Yesterday evening
was productive of nothing but looks and
compliments, and bows, and so forth; ex∣cept
two or three delightful pieces of mu∣sick,
which he executed incomparably.
But this morning, my Cecilia, Oh! this
morning! the man spoke out, told me in
down-right plain English, that he loved me!
How insipid is such a declaration, when it
comes from one, who is indifferent to us!
I do not know how it was, but instead of
being abashed, I could have smiled in his
face when he declared himself; but you may
be sure I did not, that would not have been
pretty.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139"/>
I was sitting in the little drawing-room,
reading, when he came in. To be sure he
was sent to me by the antient ladies, other∣wise
he would not have intruded; for the
man is not ill-bred. The book happened
to be Horace; upon his entering the room,
I laid it by; he asked me politely enough,
what were my studies. When I named the
author, he took the book up, and opening
the leaves, started, and looked me full in
the face; I coloured. My charming Miss
Bidulph, said he, do you prefer this to the
agreeable eetertainment of finishing this
beautiful rose here, that seems to blush at
your neglect of it? He spoke this, point∣ing
to a little piece of embroidery that lay
in a frame before me. I was nettled at
the question, it was too assuming. Sir, I
hope I was as innocently, and as usefully em∣ployed;
and I assure you I give a greater
portion of my time to my needle, than to
my book.</P>
<P>You are so lovely, madam, that nothing
you can do needs an apology. An apology,
I'll assure you! did not this look as if the
man thought I ought to beg his pardon for
understanding Latin? For this accidental,
and I think (to a woman) trivial accom∣plishment,
I am indebted, you know, to Sir
George; who took so much pains with me,
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
the two or three summers he was indisposed
at Sidney-Castle.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell me how much
he admired, how much he loved me! and
that having been encouraged by lady Grim∣ston's
assuring him that I was disengaged
(observe that), he presumed to tell me so.
Oh! thought I, perhaps thou art thyself a
Grimstonian, and do not think it necessary
that the heart should be confulted. I an∣swered
him mighty civilly, and mighty lit∣tle
to the purpose. Sir, I thank you for
your favourable sentiments—Lady Grimston
does me a great deal of honour—I think
myself happy in her good opinion—But
he was not to be so put off, he pressed me
to give him hopes, as he called it. Alas! I
have no hopes to give him. He said, he
would not presume to mention his love to
my mother, though lady Grimston pressed
him to it (it was like her), 'till he had first
declared himself to me. This was not in∣delicate;
my heart thanked him for it,
though I only returned him a bow. We
were seasonably (to me at least) interrupted
here, by the arrival of my friend the dean.
He had come to see lady Grimston, just as
Mr. Arnold had entered into conversation
with me; the old gentleman had a mind to
walk in the garden; the little drawing-room,
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
where we were, opened into it, by a glass
door; so that lady Grimston and my mother
were obliged to bring him that way. Though
I was glad that the conversation was broke
off, yet I could have wished that I had first
had an opportunity of throwing a little cold
water on Mr. Arnold's <HI>hopes,</HI> lest he should
have put too favourable an interpretation on
the reception I gave him, and mention the
thing to my mother, before I had time to
speak to her.</P>
<P>I was in some confusion at their entering
the room. Mr. Arnold had at that minute
laid hold of one of my hands, and I had but
just time to withdraw it, when the door flew
open to give entrance to the two ladies and
the good man: the latter lifting up both his
hands, as if conscious of having done some∣thing
wrong, with a good-humoured free∣dom,
asked pardon; but with a look that
seemed to indicate, he thought the apology
necessary both to Mr. Arnold and me. This
disconcerted me more; my mother smiled,
and lady Grimston drew up her long neck,
and winked at the dean. I took up my hat,
that lay in a window, without well-knowing
what I did, and said, I would wait on them
into the garden. Mr. Arnold followed my
example; but looked at me, I do not know
how—impertinently—as if he thought
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
I did not dislike him. I took one turn with
them, and then slipped away, under pretence
of going in to dress. I ran directly into
Mrs. Vere's room, and told her what had
passed between Mr. Arnold and me. She
laughed, and said, she could have told me
long ago it would have come to that. I
knew Mr. Arnold admired you, said she,
the first time I saw you in his company; he
is no contemptible conquest I can tell you.
He assured my mother, that you were the
only woman he ever saw in his life that had
made an impression on him; and I am in∣clined
to believe him, for he is not a man
of an amorous complexion; nor did I ever
hear of his making his addresses to any one,
though he might have his choice of the best
fortunes, and the best families in the county;
for the ladies, I must inform you, admire
him exceedingly; and when you are known
to be his choice, you will be the envy of
all the young women in the county. I sigh∣ed,
(I don't know why) and said, I desired
not to create envy on that account. Mrs.
Vere said, why really Miss Bidulph, if your
heart is at liberty, I know of no man more
worthy of it than Mr. Arnold; but perhaps
(looking with a kind earnestness on me) that
may not be your case. I told her, my heart
was not engaged (as it really is not; for in∣deed,
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
Cecilia, I do not think of Mr. Faulk∣land);
but that I did not find in myself any
great inclination towards Mr. Arnold. Oh!
my dear, said she, if you find no disinclina∣tion,
it is enough. I married for love, yet
I was far from being happy. The vexation
that I occasioned in my own and my hus∣band's
family, was a counter-balance to the
satisfaction of possessing the man I loved.
Mr. Arnold, besides being very amiable in
his person, has good sense, and good tem∣per;
and if you marry him with nothing
more than indifference, gratitude will soon
produce love in such a breast as yours. Were
there any thing like aversion in your heart,
then indeed it would be criminal in you to
accept of him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Vere delivered her sentiments with
such a calm sweetness, such a disinterested
sincerity, that what she said made an im∣pression
on me. We are apt, contrary as it
may seem to reason, to be more wrought
upon by the opinion and advice of young
people like ourselves, than by that of per∣sons,
whose experience certainly gives them
a better right to form judgments: but we
have a sort of a natural repugnance to the
being dictated to, even by those who have
an authority to do it; and as age gives a su∣periority,
every thing that comes from it car∣ries
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
a sort of air of prescribing, which we
are wonderfully inclined to reject.</P>
<P>Had lady Grimston said this to me, it
would have put me upon my guard, as sus∣pecting
a design on my liberty of choice.
Even my good mother might have been lis∣tened
to on this subject not without uneasi∣ness;
though my duty to her would not suf∣fer
me to give her a moment's pain, unless I
was sure that my eternal as well as temporal
happiness was at stake.</P>
<P>I told Mrs. Vere that I had no aversion to
Mr. Arnold; on the contrary, that if I
had a sister, I should wish her married to
him. Now, my Cecilia, the mischief of
it is, there <HI>can</HI> be no reasonable objection
made to him: he is a very tolerable man;
but I knew a man once that I liked better—
but fye, fye upon him! I am sure I ought
not to like him, and therefore I will not. I
am positive, if I were let alone, I should be
as happy as ever.</P>
<P>I told you I got a letter from my brother;
he says in it, he has had one from Mr. Faulk∣land,
who is now in your part of the world.
He tells Sir George, that “if my lady Bi∣dulph
will be so good as to see Miss B. and
converse with her, he is not without hopes
that she may so far exculpate him, as to in∣duce
my lady to repeal his sentence of ba∣nishment.”
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
Sir George adds his own wishes
for this, but says (to give you <HI>his</HI> words) he
fears the wench will not be honest enough to
do Faulkland justice—justice! what can
my brother mean by this? How ungenerous
these men are, even the best of them, in
love matters! He knows the poor girl doats
on her destroyer, and might perhaps take
shame to <HI>herself,</HI> rather than throw as much
blame on him as he deserves. I think this
is all the justice that can be expected from
her; and how poor an extenuation would
this make of his guilt! It would only add to
the merit of <HI>her</HI> sufferings, without lessening
his fault.</P>
<P>To what purpose then would it be? I
know my mother's sentiments already on
that head. I would not shew Sir George's
letter to her, he had said so many ridiculous
things about lady Grimston in it, which I
know would have offended her highly; o∣therwise,
on account of Mr. Faulkland's pa∣ragraph,
I should have been glad she had
seen it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 12.—Ah! my sister! my
friend! What shall I do? Oh! that offici∣ous
lady Grimston—What ill star drove
me to her house? Nothing would serve her
but she must know what Mr. Arnold said to
me in the drawing-room conference; and
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
how I had behaved. She made her enqui∣ry
before my mother and the dean, after I
had left them in the garden. What could
the man do? He had no reason to conceal
what passed, and frankly owned he had made
me an offer of his heart. Well, and how did
Miss receive it, asked lady Grimston? With
that modesty and polite sweetness that she
does every thing, answered Mr. Arnold. He
could say no less.</P>
<P>He thence took occasion to apply parti∣cularly
to my mother, apologizing at the
same time for his not having done it before.
What the self-sufficient creature added, I know
not; for my mother, from whom I had this
account, did not repeat all he said; but it
seems it was enough to make her imagine I
had not heard him reluctantly, and according∣ly
she gave him her permission to win me
and wear me.</P>
<P>I could cry for very vexation, to be made
such a puppet of. This eclaircissement I
dreaded before I had time to explain my∣self
to my mother. That best of women,
still anticipating what I had to say, congra∣tulated
me on my extraordinary prudence, in
not letting a childish misplaced attachment
keep such a hold on my heart, as to make
me blind to the merits of a more deserving
object.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
Dear madam, said I, sure Mr. Arnold
did not say that I encouraged his addresses.
Encouraged, my dear! why sure the hearing,
from a young lady of your education, is en∣couragement
enough to a man of sense.—
I heard him with complaisance, madam, be∣cause
I thought <HI>that</HI> due to him; but I had
not time to tell him, that it was my wish to
remain single, at least for some time. My
mother looked surprized. “Sidney, this
is not what I expected from you; I flattered
myself you thought no longer of Mr. Faulk∣land.”</P>
<P>She contracted her brow a little. Ma∣dam,
I do not; indeed I think no more of
him; but may I not be permitted to conti∣nue
as I am?</P>
<P>Had you never had any engagement with
Mr. Faulkland, answered my mother, I
should be far from urging you on this occa∣sion;
but circumstanced as you now are, I
think your honour is concerned.</P>
<P>Lady Grimston has put your affair in such
a light to me, as I never considered it in be∣fore.
How mortifying must the reflection
be, my dear, to think that it may be said
Mr. Faulkland perhaps flew off, from some
disadvantageous circumstance he discovered
in regard to you. The world wants not en∣vious,
malicious tongues enough to give it
this turn. Your unlucky illness, and your
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
brother's ill-timed assiduity in going so often
to him when he was at Richmond, looks as
if we had been endeavouring to recall him.
Every body knows the marriage was almost
concluded; and lady Grimston, though she
thinks our reasons for breaking it off were
extremely cogent, yet as she knows the
world well, thinks it has not virtue enough
to believe those to be the true reasons, and
that it will be much more apt to put an invi∣dious
construction on the affair, that may be
very detrimental to you in your future pro∣spects.
These considerations alone ought to
determine you; but there is one still of
greater moment, which I hope, from the
goodness of your heart, will have still greater
weight with you. That unfortunate young
lady, who <HI>ought</HI> to be the wife of Mr. Faulk∣land,
if you were once put beyond the reach
even of his most distant hope, would stand
the better chance for having justice done to
her; at least it would leave him void of that
pretence which he at first pleaded, and which
probably he will continue to do, while you
remain single. Think seriously of the mat∣ter,
my love. I shall only add, that Mr.
Arnold is every way an unexceptionable
match, and that your acceptance of him will
be extremely agreeable to me; as on the
contrary, your refusal will give an uneasiness
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
to your indulgent mother, which she never
yet experienced from you.</P>
<P>She left me with these cruel words, cruel
in their kindness—Oh! she knows I am flex∣ible
by nature, and to <HI>her</HI> will, yielding as
air. What can I do? My heart is not in a
disposition to love—Yet again and again I re∣peat
it, Mr. Faulkland has no interest there.
What he once had he has lost; but I cannot
compel it to like, and unlike, and like anew
at pleasure. Fain would I bring myself
chearfully to conform to my mother's will,
for I have no will of my own. I never knew
what it was to have one, and never shall, I
believe; for I am sure I will not contend with
a husband.</P>
<P>I have told Mrs. Vere what my mother
said to me; she is entirely of her mind;
every body is combined against me; I am
treated like a baby, that knows not what is
fit for it to chuse, or to reject.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.—I have been searching
my heart, my dear Cecilia, to try if there
remained a lurking particle of my former
flame unextinguished; a flame I call it, as
we are allowed the metaphor, but it never
rose to <HI>that;</HI> it was but a single ray, a gen∣tle
glow that just warmed my breast without
scorching: what it might have arisen to, I
will not say; but I have the satisfaction to
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
find that the short-lived fire is quite extinct,
and the mansion is even chilled with cold.</P>
<P>This was a very necessary scrutiny, before
I would even entertain a thought of Mr. Ar∣nold;
and, believe me, had I found it other∣wise
than I say, I would rather have hazard∣ed
my mother's displeasure by owning the
truth to her, than injure any man, by giving
him my hand with an estranged heart.</P>
<P>I will acknowledge to you, my sister, that
it was not without a struggle I reduced my
mind to this frame. My heart (foolish thing)
industrious to perplex itself, would fain have
suggested some palliating circumstances in
Mr. Faulkland's favour; but I forbid it to
interpose. Trifler, said I, let your guardian,
your proper guide, judge and determine for
you in this important cause, whereon so
much of your future peace depends. It
sighed, but had the virtue to submit; and I
arraigned Faulkland before a little tribunal
in my breast, where I would suffer reason
only to preside. The little felon, love,
knocked at the door once or twice, but
justice kept him out; and after a long (and
I think a fair) tryal, he was at length cast;
and in order to strengthen my resolves, and
justify my mother's, as well as my own con∣duct,
these are the arguments which I have
deduced from the evidences against him.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151"/>
If Mr. Faulkland seared the frailty of his
virtue, why did he not fly when he was first
alarmed with the knowledge of the lady's
passion for him? If not for his own sake, yet
at least for her's. If he could not return
her love, was he not cruel in suffering her to
feed a hopeless flame? But since his evil fate
urged him on, and the unhappy girl lost her
honour, was he not bound to repair it? He
had never seen me at that time, was under
no personal engagements to me, and might
easily have acquitted himself to my brother,
from so justifiable a motive.</P>
<P>What if I had married him, ignorant of
this secret, and it had afterwards come to
my ears, how miserable would it have made
me, to think that I had stood between an
unfortunate young creature and her happi∣ness?
For had Mr. Faulkland never heard
of me, had he not been prejudiced in my
favour, this young woman's beauty and in∣nocence
(which he acknowledges) might have
then engaged his honest vows; the wicked
aunt would not have been tempted to betray
her trust, nor he (shocking thought! when∣ever
it recurs) to buy that favour he might
have obtained on virtuous terms. His prior
engagements to my brother was the fatal
plea that undid them both! Had he not been
furnished with this excuse, her hopes might
have supported her virtue; or, if ignorant
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
of this, she fell, what pretence could he offer,
after the injury <HI>was</HI> done, for not fulfilling an
obligation of so much more importance? I
could not have suffered by not obtaining a
man I never saw; Miss B. is undone by lo∣sing
him: yet his word to Sir George, the
breach of which could have been attended
with no ill consequence, was to be preferred
to an act of justice. This is that false ho∣nour
upon which the men pique themselves
so much. An innocent child stigmatized;
an amiable woman abandoned to shame and
grief! I thank Heaven I made not myself
accessary to this. <HI>Had</HI> I married Mr. Faulk∣land,
<HI>knowing</HI> his fault, I could not say so,
nor have blamed any thing but my own im∣prudence,
If <HI>I</HI> in my turn found myself de∣serted.
Who knows but he might (after
having bound me in chains,) return to his
neglected mistress; and <HI>that</HI> love, which,
when it would have been meritorious in him,
he disrelished, he might have pursued with
eagerness when interdicted. This might
have been the case. I believe you may re∣member
an instance of it among our ac∣quaintance.
Mr. Saunders who refused a
young lady for his bride, from an absolute
dislike of her person, took uncommon pains
to debauch her when she became the wife of
his friend. Had Mr. Faulkland so behaved,
what a wretch would it have made me! you
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
know I have not a grain of jealousy in my
composition, yet I am sure a neglect of this
kind would make me very miserable.</P>
<P>You have not forgot, I believe, that about
two years ago there was a match proposed
to my mother by the bishop of B. between
me and his nephew. The young man was
heir to a good fortune, was reckoned hand∣some
and accomplished, and I think he real∣ly
was so: I was entirely free from prepos∣sessions
in favour of any one, and had no
objection to him, but that I knew he had a
most lamentably-vulnerable heart, for he had
been in love with two or three women of my
acquaintance. My mother mentioned him
to me upon the good old prelate's recom∣mendation,
and I gave her this as my rea∣son
for disliking the offer, which she ap∣proved
of so intirely, that the thing went
no farther. Indeed I think that woman is a
fool, who risques her contentment with one
of a light disposition. Marriage will not
change men's natures; and it is not every
one who has virtue or prudence enough to
be reclaimed. Upon the whole, I am satis∣fied
with my lot; and am sure I could hear
with pleasure, that Mr. Faulkland was mar∣ried
to that Miss B. I wish I knew the other
letters that compose her name.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 16.—My mother asked
me to-day, had I considered of what she
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
had been saying to me? I told her I had, and
only begged a little more time. She kissed
me, with tears in her eyes. To be sure, my
dear, as much as you can reasonably desire.
I know my Sidney is above trifling. Mrs.
Vere was present when my mother left the
room. Oh! Miss Bidulph, said she, who
would refuse to gratify such a parent as that?
Had <HI>my</HI> mother condescended to treat me so,
I am sure she could have wrought on me to
do any thing she liked, even though it had
been repugnant to my inclination. Dear ma∣dam,
I replied, how sweetly you inforce my
duty—Yes, I will obey that kindest best of
mothers. I believe I spoke this, tho' without
intending it, in a tone that implied something
like making a merit of this concession; for
Mrs. Vere immediately answered, There's a
good child! that to oblige its mama, will
accept of a very handsome young gentleman,
with a good estate, and one that many a girl
in England would give her eyes for. I felt
the rebuke; but turning it off with a smile,
said, but you forget, my dear, that I am
not dying for him.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 20.—How will you plume
yourself on your sagacity, Cecilia, when
you read this account of my love, which
you so wisely foretold? I can tell you I am
trying to like Mr. Arnold as fast as I can; I
make him sing and play for this purpose
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
from morning 'till night, for he is here every
day, and all day. Lady Grimston holds
her head a quarter of a yard higher than she
did before; and looks, as who should say,
it was <HI>I</HI> that brought this about. The dean
is as frolick as May-day upon it; for he is
very fond of Mr. Arnold; but tells him he
will not forgive him for robbing him of his
second wife; for such, he says, he intended
me. I think his daughter (a pretty girl of
about seventeen) looks a little grave of late.
I hope she does not like Mr. Arnold herself.
I wish my mother would take it into her
head that she was in love with him, and that
Mr. Arnold had promised to marry her;
then should I a second time crown me with
a willow garland. But there is no fear of
this, or rather no hope.</P>
<P>Lady Grimston has given my mother <HI>such</HI>
a character of Mr. Arnold, that if you will
take her word for it, there is not a man like
him in the world; and my mother firmly
believes every syllable she says. She told
me to-day she would write to Sir George, to
give him an account of the matter, and de∣sire
his advice. This is a compliment she
would not omit paying, for any considerati∣on,
tho' I know my brother's judgment has
now lost all credit with her; and that, let his
opinion be what it will, she is firmly re∣solved
on her new plan. Knowing as you
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
do my mother's firmness, when once she is
possessed with a thing, you would not won∣der
that I did not make attempts to alter her
mind, which I knew would be fruitless. She
likes Mr. Arnold prodigiously; she piques
herself on her skill in physiognomy, and says,
if she is deceived in this Gentleman, she will
never again rely on this science. Lady Grim∣ston
is so fond of him, that I wonder she did
not marry him herself.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 23.—We have received
two letters from Sir George; one in answer
to my mother's, the other to me. I will
give them both to you: the following is a
copy of that to my mother:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I thank you for the honour you do me in
asking my advice, in regard to the proposal
of marriage you have received for my sister;
but I am entirely disqualified from giving
you any, as I am an absolute stranger both
to the person and character of the gentleman
you mention; and know no more of him,
than that I have heard there is such a person,
who has some estate in the county where you
are.</P>
<P>As you are absolute mistress of your
daughter's will, as well of her person, I shall
not presume to interfere in this nice point.
If the marriage is not <HI>already</HI> agreed upon
(which may be the case, notwithstanding the
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
compliment you do me the favour to pay
me,) I think it would be generous in you to
see Miss B. and hear what she has to say, be∣fore
you proceed farther; but in this, as in
every thing else, your own discretion must
guide you.</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
Madam,
Your affectionate son,
and most obedient servant,

<DATELINE>London,
<DATE>Sept. 22.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>My mother was exceedingly displeased
with this Letter. She said Sir George had a
haughtiness in him that was very offensive to
her. I have acquitted myself in applying
to him, and shall give myself no farther
trouble about him, or his opinion. As for
Miss B. I think she can hardly be under a
necessity of coming to town as yet, and that
affair may keep cold, for I have but little
curiosity to hear what the poor soul may be
prompted to say, as I am sure I shall be time
enough to afford her any assistance she may
stand in need of. This was the whole of
her observation. My brother's letter to me
is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Sidney,</OPENER>
<P>I received with concern (though I own not with
surprize) an account from my mother,
of a new treaty of marriage that is on foot
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
between you and a Mr. Arnold, of whom I
know nothing. Instead of congratulating
you on this occasion, I cannot help con∣doling
with you; for I have a better opinion
of your heart than to suppose it can have so
soon renounced poor Faulkland. I do not re∣proach
you for your acquiescence in giving
him up, I <HI>know</HI> you could not do otherwise;
but why in the name of precipitancy, are you
to be hurried into wedlock already? You went
into the country to recover your health, I
thought; prithee how comes this new hus∣band
into your way? I know, child, it is
not of your seeking, and do from my heart
pity you.</P>
<P>I would by no means have you guilty of a
breach of duty to our mother; but for Hea∣ven's
sake, why don't you try your influ∣ence
over her, to have this sudden scheme of
matrimony suspended, 'till she sees and
talks to this girl that Faulkland refers her to?
If the wench owns that he was not to blame
so much as she herself was, and relinquishes
all pretensions to him, don't you think she
(my mother I mean) would, in that case, re∣main
bound in honour to yield you to his
prior claim?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sidney, I must blame you for
this part of your conduct; it looks like a
strange insensibility in you.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159"/>
I know you will urge a perfect submission
to your mother's will; and I know too, that
<HI>will</HI> is as absolute as that of an Eastern mo∣narch.
I therefore repeat it, I do not mean
to reproach you with your compliance, but
I am vexed to the heart, and must give it
vent.</P>
<P>I see plainly that old piece of formality,
lady Grimston's infernal shrivelled paw in all
this. For my Mother of herself, I am sure,
would not have thought of disposing of you,
without your liking, so soon after an affair
that had created you so much uneasiness, un∣less
it had been suggested to her by some∣body.
Prithee tell me what sort of a man
this Arnold really is, for I do not depend on
the partial representations I have had of him.</P>
<P>I wish Miss B. was come to town, but she
is not yet arrived. I enquired for her of Mr.
Faulkland's housekeeper, by the name of
Jefferis. The woman is at the house at Put∣ney
waiting to receive her, but does not
know how soon she will come. Would she
had been buried before Faulkland saw her!</P>
<P>I shall expect a letter from you soon.
How comes it that you never mentioned Mr.
Arnold to me in any that you have writ? But
I excuse you, and am</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate brother,
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Sept. 22.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>G. B.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
You see this is Sir George himself, my
dear, a mixture of petulancy and indelicacy.
There is one thing in him, however, com∣mendable;
his steady adherence to his
friend's interests. You find how impossible
for me it is to shew such a letter to my mo∣ther:
by his strange unguarded manner of
writing, which he does not consider, he
defeats his own purposes; for if any use
could be made of that part of his letter re∣lative
to Miss B. I could not shew my mo∣ther
part, without letting her see the whole:
but that is not to be done; and I can only
thank my good fortune that I received this,
and the last letter from him, without her
knowledge.</P>
<P>I will now give you my answer to this
letter, which I wrote, by the return of the
post.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Brother,</OPENER>
<P>I thank you for your condolements, but
can assure you my heart is not in such a si∣tuation
as to require any. I own I had all
the esteem for Mr. Faulkland, which I
thought his merit deserved. Duty to my
good mother, and an undeniable blemish
in his character, first wrought a change in
my sentiments towards him: my own peace
of mind now requires me to improve that
change into indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161"/>
You do me justice in supposing that I
should never think of seeking a husband;
and you have formed as right a judgment
in regard to lady Grimston's being the pro∣moter
of this union. As for Mr. Ar∣nold,
though perhaps (had I never known
your friend) he might not have been the
man of my choice, yet have I no dislike to
him. I believe him to be a very worthy
gentleman; and that my mother has not
been partial in her representations. I am
sure, at least, she has said nothing of him
but what she has seen, or been told, and
has good reason to believe.</P>
<P>I wish, dear brother, you had writ with
more caution, that I might have laid before
my mother what you said in relation to Miss
B. It may have its weight with me, though
I cannot answer for its having any with her.
Do you forget her having told me, that she
conceived a sort of horror at the thoughts
of my marrying Mr. Faulkland? She can∣not
but be sensible, that Miss B. is not with∣out
her share of blame in that affair, which
has so perplexed us all. But you know too
that does not exculpate Mr. Faulkland.
The young lady's relinquishing her hopes
(for a claim I think she does not make),
would only the more excite my mother's
compassion, and interest her in her favour.
To sum up the whole in one word, my mo∣ther
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
is resolved, and you yourself acknow∣ledge
that her will is absolute. She has
used the most irresistible argument to ob∣tain
my consent, <HI>viz.</HI> that it would make
<HI>her</HI> happy. Spare then, my dear brother,
unkind reflections on any part of my beha∣viour;
for I am determined to pursue,
through life, that rule of conduct, which I
have hitherto invariably adhered to; I mean
that of preferring to my own the hap∣piness
of those who are most dear to me.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>September</HI> 25.—Mr. Arnold has so ma∣ny
advocates here, that his interest cannot
fail of being promoted. Mrs. Vere ad∣mires
him; the Dean commends him; my
mother praises him; lady Grimston extols
him to the skies. No one is silent, but the
young girl that I mentioned to you before;
she only colours and hangs down her head
when he is spoken of. I really begin to
fear that the poor thing loves him; but he
never made any addresses to her, and I
hope does not suspect it.</P>
<P>Things are now gone so far, that my
mother and lady Grimston talked to day of
settlements. Mr. Arnold receives but twelve
hundred pounds a year from his estate: his
brother's widow, as I have already told you,
having a jointure upon it of three hundred
pounds a year. She lives entirely in Lon∣don,
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
and is, I am told, a very imprudent
woman, and not all esteemed by the family.
The elder Mr. Arnold and she were married
several years, but never had a child; the
last two years of his life his wife and he lived
separate, her conduct having given room
for some suspicions, very injurious to her
husband's honour.</P>
<P>The Arnold estate was originally a very
considerable one, but has been dissipated by
the extravagance of the successive possessors.
What remains, however, is quite clear,
and is likely to be kept so by the good ma∣nagement
of the present owner. His late
brother was exceedingly remiss in his affairs,
and spent most of his time in London; and
if it had not been for Mr. Arnold, the
mansion-house would have fallen to the
ground; but his brother lent it to him, and
he kept it in repair for his own use, as he is
fond of the place: though he has a pretty
house in Kent, belonging to another estate
of about three hundred pounds a year, which
came to him by his mother, for he is the son
of a second marriage. And this, 'till his
brother's death, was the whole of his income;
but he is so good an oeconomist, that he al∣ways
made a genteeler figure on his three
hundred pounds a year, than his brother
did in twelve.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164"/>
My mother, who you know is integrity
itself, thinks that I ought not to have more
settled on me than the widow of Mr. Ar∣nold's
brother had, whose fortune was su∣perior
to mine. Mr. Arnold makes a much
handsomer proposal; lady Grimston is for
laying hold of it. The Dean was for strike∣ing
a medium. I do not care how they
settle it; but I fancy my mother will have
her own way in this.</P>
<P>She purposes going to town next week,
that the wedding—(bless me! whose wed∣ding
is it that I am talking of so coolly?)
well—that it may be celebrated in her own
house. This to be sure will send Sir George
directly out of it. I cannot help it; I am
born to give, and to receive vexation.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold speaks of taking a house in
London, where my mother is to have an
apartment whenever she chuses to be in
town. This is a pleasing circumstance to
me; and she likewise proposes our being
sometimes with her at Sidney-castle. That
is a prospect which loses much of its charms,
by the reflection that my dear Cecilia is not
there.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 1.—All preliminaries are set∣tled.
There has been a fuss with parch∣ments
this week past. My mother has car∣ried
her point, in regard to the jointure;
and has made choice of that little estate in
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
Kent to be settled on me, as it is a complete
three hundred pounds a year, detached en∣tirely
from the rest, and has a pretty house
on it. This was all she would accept of,
though, to do Mr. Arnold justice, he would
have been much more liberal; but, my mo∣ther
says, a single woman, bred in retire∣men
as I have been, who cannot live on that,
does not deserve to live at all; adding, that
the estate was already subject to one jointure,
and the widow so young a woman; if it
should be also my misfortune to become one
early, a great part of the fortune would be
swallowed by dowagers, and the heir not have
enough to support his rank.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2.—This morning my mother,
lady Grimston, the Dean, and Mr. Arnold
(who is the idol of them all) took a rum∣bling
together in the old coach, by way of
taking the air, in a dusty road; and what
do you think was the result of their delibe∣rations
in this jaunt? Why truly lady Grim∣ston,
proud of her handy work, would
needs see it accomplished; and nothing will
serve her, but I must be married at her
house. My mother opposed it at first; but
the Dean seconded the proposal, that he
might have (as he expressed himself) the
satisfaction of contributing <HI>himself</HI> to make
Mr. Arnold happy; and Mr. Arnold (au∣daciously
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
expecting, I suppose, that this
would hasten the ceremony) joined his in∣treaties
so effectually, that my mother was
obliged to yield.</P>
<P>What a tormenting old woman is this la∣dy
Grimston! I hoped, at least, for the re∣spite
of a month, by getting to London. I
thought first to have delayed the time of
our going to town, and then to have saddled
away a while longer under pretence of pre∣parations;
though there is but little room
for that now, as all my fineries, destined I
thought to another purpose, are lying quietly
in my trunks at home. But then one
might have contrived many little occasions
of delay. There was a house to be fixed
upon, and I had twenty things to do, and,
as my mother says, many things fall out
between the cup and the lip. But all my
expectations are blown away, and I have
but one poor fortnight given me to recollect
my scattered thoughts, when they are
all to be centered in Mr. Arnold. I am
not merry, my Cecilia, but I am determin∣ed
not to appear sad; neither am I so; I
hope I have no reason.</P>
<P>My mother purposes writing again to Sir
George, to desire his presence at my mar∣riage.
I hope he will behave respectfully
to every one here, if he should come.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167"/>
<HI>October</HI> 5.—Mr. Arnold has writ to
town, to bespeak a new chariot; he will
do nothing in regard to the house, 'till I
am on the spot to please myself. I intend
sending Patty to town, to bring me down
my bridal trappings.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold has given some necessary or∣ders
for the new decking of his person, as
well as some of the apartments in the old
mansion-house, which seem a little to want
refurnishing; most of the goods having
been inhabitants there since the time of his
great grand-father.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9.—My mother's last letter to
Sir George has produced the following an∣swer,
which he sent down by Patty, when
she returned down here with my cloaths.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am sorry I cannot accept of the invitati∣on
you favour me with, to be present at my
sister's nuptials. Some affairs in Wiltshire
require my immediate attendance; and I
had settled matters before I received your
summons, so as to set out as on this day.
I wish you all imaginable satisfaction in your
new son-in-law; and my sister abundance
of happiness in her spouse.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, Madam, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Oct. 8.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168"/>
I am glad Sir George does not come
down; I am sure if he did, his behaviour
would be such, as would render him no very
acceptable guest at Grimston-hall.</P>
<P>A week, but a short week, to come, be∣fore
my fate is irrevocably fixed; or revo∣cable
only by the hand of death! This re∣flection,
solemn as it is, does not alarm me;
because, after again calling my heart to the
strictest account, I think I <HI>can</HI> pronounce it
entirely free. Mr. Arnold will soon have
an indisputable right to it; and it is my
firm purpose to use my utmost endeavours
to give him entire possession of it. He
every day gains upon my esteem. If his
talents are not so glittering as I have seen
some others possessed of, he is nevertheless
master of an exceedingly good understand∣ing,
which a sort of diffidence in his manner
does not suffer him to shew at once to the
best advantage. His temper is extremely
sweet, and he seems to have an openess of
heart (when he throws off a little shyness
which he has contracted) that is exceedingly
engaging. His love for me appears as ser∣vent
as I believe it sincere; and I should
be ungrateful not to do my utmost to re∣turn
it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 14.—How precipitate has been
my fortune? Twice within these three
months have I been almost at the eve of
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
my intended nuptials. Those which <HI>were</HI>
to have been, I thought as certain as those
which are <HI>now</HI> to be solemnized within two
days. Who knows what may still happen
to frustate our present designs?—No—there
is not another Miss B. to interpose. Mr.
Arnold seems to be one of those who are
born to pass quietly through life. He has
already attained to the age of thirty, with∣out
one event ever happening to him, but
such as happen to every man every day.
May no future storm ever interrupt his or
my tranquillity! for they will soon be one
and the same thing.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16.—The die is thrown, my
Cecilia, and thy Sidney is the wife of Mr.
Arnold! This day we were married; the
good dean joined our hands, and his daugh∣ter
was one of my bride-maids. The poor
girl was taken ill during the ceremony, and
was obliged to leave the church, which has
confirmed me in my suspicions—Oh! how I
pity her! I believe indeed she only seigned
illness for an excuse to retire. Mrs. Vere
went out with her; but she would not suf∣fer
her to attend her home. She promised
to dine with us, if she should be better; and
so she did, and seemed chearful and pretty
well; but I thought she looked as if she
had been crying. She made my heart ach
—but I am in hopes it is but a slight wound;
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
she is exceedingly lively, and, I dare say,
will soon get the better of it.</P>
<P>Lady Grimston was downright tiresome
with her compliments: and preached an
hour long about the duty of children to
their parents; and how good a wife that
woman was likely to make, who had al∣ways
been exemplary in her filial obedience.
Ah! lady Grimston, thought I, by what I
have heard of you, you did not seem to
number obedience amongst wife-like virtues
in your own case, though you can preach it
up to others. But I knew this sermon was
chiefly intended for poor Mrs. Vere's use. My
mother was all kindness and complacency.
She seemed so delighted, that I rejoiced in
having had it in my power to give her so
much happiness. Lady Grimston did the
honours of her house on this occasion with
great magnificence, and I believe I need
not tell you, with most exquisite decorum.
Indeed this wedding was conducted with
such a decent festivity, so rationally on all
sides, and such a comfortable privacy, that
I was not half so much shocked as I expect∣ed
to have been.</P>
<P>We have no company here besides the
family of the house, my dear good old
Dean, his lady and daughter, one young
lady more, and a relation of Mr. Arnold's;
a gentleman who came from London on
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
purpose to be present on this (as it is called)
joyful occasion.</P>
<P>We shall leave this house to-morrow, Mr.
Arnold and I, I mean. I am to be put in∣to
possession of the old mansion of Arnold-abbey.
My mother is to continue with lady
Grimston a week or a fortnight longer, and
then she goes to London on no other call, as
she says, but to see and administer comfort
to poor Miss B. who she supposes will be by
that time come to her retreat.</P>
<P>I believe I shall remain in the country
while the weather continues pleasant, but am
not yet determined.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17.—We took leave of lady
Grimston this morning, or rather of her
house; for her ladyship, my dear mother,
and all the good folks that were our guests
at Grimston-hall, are to dine with us to-day
at Arnold-abbey. I desired I might be per∣mitted
to go home without any parade▪ and
in as private a manner as possible; for you
know how I hate a bustle. Mr. Arnold very
obligingly indulged me in this request, and
conducted my sweet Mrs. Vere and me home
in his own coach, at eight of the clock this
morning. I found every thing in exact order
at Arnold-abbey. The house is very spa∣cious
and convenient, though very old-fashioned.
Some of the rooms however are
newly fitted up, perfectly neat and handsome.
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
The servants are orderly and well-behaved,
and every thing seems to be exactly well re∣gulated.
You may be sure I have taken my
own Patty home with me; I intend to con∣stitute
her house-keeper, and give her an ad∣ditional
salary for her additional trouble.
Mr. Arnold had nobody in that capacity be∣fore,
as his household had not been settled
since the acquisition of his fortune, and he
reserved the chusing of so material a domes∣tic
to me; but as I do not love to multiply
servants, and know that Patty is very capable
of the place, I shall take no other.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 21.—Visitors still in abundance:
all the gentry in the neighbourhood for
some miles about have been to pay us their
compliments; at least, I hope by this time
they have <HI>all</HI> been here, for we have not
had a minute to ourselves these three days.
It will make me up ten to return them, as
many of the families live at a good distance
from hence.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, whose mourning has been
laid aside since our wedding-day, seems to
have a very good taste in dress; he is per∣fectly
well shaped, and appears to great ad∣vantage
in colours; in short, he is more ami∣able
than I thought he was. It is with great
pleasure that I observe my young acquaint∣ance,
on whose heart I feared Mr. Arnold
had made an impression, has recovered her
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
usual vivacity. With people extremely full
of spirits, love is not apt to sink very deep,
or last long, when it does not meet with a
return.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30.—My mother sets out for
London to-morrow, and Mr. Arnold has
proposed to me, that he and I should ac∣company
her. He says, he wants to look
out for a house, and should like to fix in one
before the winter advances; and that we may
take up our abode at my mother's 'till our
house is ready for us. My mother is charm∣ed
at this proposal: she dreads the thoughts
of parting with me; and as she intends go∣ing
(after a convenient stay in London) down
to Sidney-castle, if I remain here, our sepa∣ration
must be immediate. I know this is
Mr. Arnold's kind reason for desiring me to
go; he thinks I shall be less affected at part∣ing
with my mother, when in the midst of
the various scenes which London affords,
than I should be if I were to continue here.
He gives not this for a reason, but I know it
is his true one; for he is not fond of Lon∣don
himself, especially at a season of the
year, when the country is so much more
agreeable. I thanked him for this mark
of his tenderness, and am determined to
go.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 31.—Once more returned
to London in very good spirits, after a
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
stay of little more than two months in
Essex, in which time so material and un∣expected
a change has been made in my
condition.</P>
<P>Lady Grimston took a most affectionate
leave of my mother, and asked her, with
more tenderness than I thought her capable
of, How many ages it would be before they
should meet again? As for Mr. Arnold and
me, she considers us as her neighbours.
The Dean pleases himself with that expec∣tation
too; and the dear Mrs. Vere, who
shed tears at bidding me adieu, promises
herself the happiness (as she kindly expressed
herself) of spending many delightful days
with me next summer. She set out on her
return to her own house, at the same time
that we left ours to go to town.</P>
<P>My brother is still in Wiltshire; but I
find he did not leave town at the time he
mentioned in his letter to my mother, nor
for some days after. This Patty learnt from
the servants; but I hope it will not come to
my mother's ears, for she would take it ex∣tremely
ill of him.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, for the first time, mention∣ed,
that he was very much disappointed in
not having had the honour of seeing Sir
George at his house in the country; but
he hoped, when he came to town, his
brother and he should make up for this,
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
by being the more together. I wish Sir
George may behave as he ought to this de∣serving
brother. Mr. Arnold little ima∣gines
how much he was an enemy to the
match, and much less his reason for it. I
should be very sorry Mr. Arnold were to
know how near I was being married to ano∣ther
man; it might give a delicate mind
pain, lest there should remain any traces of
this former attachment in the breast of the
woman he loves; but I hope there is no
danger of his hearing of it, certainly no
one would be so indiscreet as to mention it
to him. Mr. Arnold has lived chiefly in
the country, and may never have heard of
Mr. Faulkland, as he was so short a time
returned from his travels, on which he had
been absent more than five years; and as he
is now out of the kingdom, probably he
will not be spoken of. I have begged of
my mother, who is naturally communicative,
never to name Mr. Faulkland to Mr. Ar∣nold,
and have given my reasons for desiring
this. She says, she thinks it would be better
to tell him the whole affair at once; but I
cannot agree with her in that opinion; and
have at last prevailed on her to promise me
she will not speak of it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 2.—My mother drove out
in my new chariot to-day (a very fine gay
one it is), and went to Putney, to enquire
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
after Miss B. by the name of Mrs. Jefferis.
She soon found the house, a very neat box,
with a pretty garden behind it. The door
was opened by a servant maid; and my mo∣ther
being told the lady was at home, sent
in her name; and was immediately con∣ducted
up stairs into a very elegant little
dressing-room, where the lady was sitting at
her toilet; and Mr. Faulkland's housekeeper
(whom my mother had seen before) assisting
to dress her head. On my mother's entering
the room, Miss B. rose off her chair, and
soon discovered by her shape (for she was
without her stays), that it was high time for
her to seek a place of concealment. The
housekeeper immediately withdrew; and the
young lady seemed in the utmost confusion;
my mother says, she herself was at a loss
how to begin the conversation, but Miss B.
relieved her, and spoke first. She thanked
her for the honour she did her by so cha∣ritable
a visit, which, she said, Mr. Faulk∣land
had long ago made her hope for;
and which she must consider as the greatest
consolation in her present unhappy circum∣stances.</P>
<P>My mother placed herself by her. Ma∣dam,
said she, Mr. Faulkland made it a
point with me before he left England, that
I should see you, and afford you all the as∣sistance
in my power, or that you should stand
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or. You seem to be commodiously
situated here, and I understand have a very
careful good woman to attend you.</P>
<P>I have so, madam, she answered; but the
most material circumstance is wanting to my
relief: Mr. Faulkland!—He is not here.
Tears started into her eyes as she spoke. You
were apprised of his absence, said my mother,
before you came to town. I was, madam, and
with the cause of it; she hung down her head,
and was silent.</P>
<P>My mother reassumed the conversation.
She told her, she thought it a most provi∣dential
discovery, that had given her the
knowledge of Mr. Faulkland's ill behaviour,
time enough to prevent his marriage with
her daughter; assuring her, she would not,
for the universe, have had me the wife of a
man under such ties, as she must consider
Mr. Faulkland to be. Miss B. brightened
up a little upon my mother's saying this.
Did Mr. Faulkland ever tell you, madam,
how the unhappy affair happened? My mo∣ther
told her, she knew not particulars;
that she had been referred to her for a full
explanation; that Mr. Faulkland had always
endeavoured to excuse himself, and went so
far as to say, He was sure the lady herself
would acquit him in a great measure. Ah!
madam! Miss B. cried, and shook her head.
'Tis as I suspected, said my mother, Mr.
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
Faulkland is an ungenerous man. A young
lady of your modest appearance, I am sure
he must have taken more pains to seduce,
than he will acknowledge. Miss B. blushed
exceedingly—Oh! madam, you have a
charitable, generous heart, I was <HI>indeed</HI> se∣duced.
I knew it, replied my mother.
Did he promise to marry you? She
coloured deeper than before. I will not
accuse him of that, madam. My mother
proceeded; You have a relation, madam;
I understand she was accessary to your mis∣fortune.
Yes, the barbarous woman, an∣swered
the lady, she was the contriver of my
destruction; and if I could have avoided it,
I would never have seen her face again.
Tears of grief and indignation again burst
from her eyes. Have comfort, madam, said
my mother, all may end well yet. I can
have no hopes, answered Miss B. Mr.
Faulkland flies me, you see, nor can I ever
expect to recover his heart, since so charming
a young lady, as I hear Miss Bidulph is, has
possession of it; and though your goodness
disappointed him in his late views, he may
not yet despair. I found by this, continued
my mother, that Miss B. knew nothing of
your being married, and I made haste to tell
her. I never saw joy so visible in a counte∣nance.
She clasped her hands together;
Dear madam! what do you tell me? How
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
you revive my drooping heart! then I am
not <HI>quite</HI> hopeless, there is a <HI>possibility</HI> in my
favour.</P>
<P>She then asked my mother if Mr. Faulk∣land
had acquainted her with her real name,
or that of her relation. My mother, who
had once or twice called her by the name
of Jefferis, assured her he had not. That
was generous in him, said she; he <HI>can</HI> be
generous in <HI>some</HI> points. But I have no rea∣son
to conceal it from so prudent and worthy
a lady as you are; my real name is Burchell;
that of my cruel relation I will forbear to
mention, out of respect to my good uncle,
whose wife she is. Mr. Faulkland, she add∣ed,
left a Bill of five hundred pounds with
his house-keeper, to provide every thing for
me that I should want; with assurances that
he would take the tenderest care of—
the poor young creature hesitated, and could
proceed no farther; but my mother said she
understood her meaning. They had a good
deal more discourse: my mother promised
to see her often during her confinement, and
took her leave.</P>
<P>She tells me, she is exceedingly pretty,
and has such an air of innocence and sim∣plicity,
as very much engages one in her
favour.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180"/>
I have set down this whole conversation,
with every other particular, exactly as my
mother related it.</P>
<P>She, who has a most circumstantial memo∣ry,
repeated it word for word; and I, from
a custom of throwing upon paper every thing
that occurs to me, have habituated myself to
retain the minutest things.</P>
<P>I know not, my dear, whether you will
be of my opinion; but I cannot help think∣ing,
that there was something like art in Miss
Burchell's behaviour, far from that candour
which Mr. Faulkland seemed to expect from
her. My mother mentioned the <HI>pains</HI> that
she supposed had been taken to <HI>seduce</HI> her;
her deep blush at this hint, makes me suspect
that her answer was not dictated by sincerity.
She saw my mother was not acquainted with
particulars, and that she was willing to pass
a favourable judgment on her fault; it looks
to me as if she laid hold of this prejudice—
and yet she <HI>owned</HI> that Mr. Faulkland had
never promised to marry her—I know not
what to think; but there appears to me,
upon the whole, something evasive and dis∣ingenuous
in her conduct. My mother, who
is all openness and integrity, saw it not in
this light. But be it as it may, it is no
longer of consequence to me, which was
most to blame, the gentleman or the lady:
Miss Burchell is certainly the injured Person;
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
perhaps I too may have wronged her in my
surmises; if I have, I beg her pardon; the
observations I have made on her behaviour
are only <HI>en passant,</HI> and I do from my heart
wish Mr. Faulkland would make her his
wife. You may perceive, from what I have
told you, how little this interview was like∣ly
to produce in Mr. Faulkland's favour, had
it even been brought about sooner. My
mother is now more than ever confirmed in
her opinion, that the poor young creature
has been deceived; and she prays, that Mr.
Faulkland may not be overtaken with a judg∣ment,
which she thinks nothing but his mar∣rying
the girl can avert.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 10.—We have at length
fixed upon a house to our liking, a handsome
convenient one in St. James's-street. We
are preparing to get it furnished as fast as we
can, that we may go into it; for if my bro∣ther
should come to town, I know <HI>our</HI> being
with my mother will be an objection to his
lodging in her house: this I should be
sorry for, as she told him he might
make use of it while it remained in her
hands.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 15.—Thank my stars! I have
got over the fatigue of receiving and paying
a second round of bridal visits, and I am
really so tired of it, that, uninviting as the
season is, I could wish myself in quiet at
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
Arnold-Abbey; but I cannot think of leave∣ing
London while my mother continues in
it, and she is now resolved to do so 'till
Miss Burchell, or rather, on this occasion,
Mrs. Jefferis, is brought to-bed. You can't
imagine how sollicitous she is about her;
every time she sees her she seems more and
more pleased with her. I am very glad it has
happened so, for the poor young woman's sake;
my mother is as warm in her attachments
as in her resentments. She visits her almost
every second day; for the poor thing it seems
is ill at present, and can't leave her chamber.
She tells me she is extremely melancholy, and
seems much to dread the approaching hour.
I greatly honour my good mother for her hu∣manity
towards her: in her terrifying situa∣tion
she must want the tenderness of a well-bred
as well as a sensible friend; for it must
be a melancholy thing, in such circumstances,
to have no one about her but servants, and
those strangers too.</P>
<P>She told my mother, that her altered
looks, and frequent sicknesses, gave her
aunt (who was privy to the cause of it all)
a pretence for asking her uncle's permission
for Miss to go to Bath, which she told him
would do her more good than any thing.
He consented, and supposed she was actu∣ally
gone thither under the care of a lady,
whom her aunt named, who was really go∣ing
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
there in order to settle for life, and to whose
house she went for a day or two to give a co∣lour
to this story. Her aunt contrived that she
should not take any servant with her; give∣ing
it for a reason, that as she might be as
well attended by the lady's servants with
whom she lodged, and be considered by her
as one of the family, a maid would only
be an unnecessary incumbrance. She added,
that her uncle was so afflicted with the gout,
that he never stirred abroad, and saw very
little company, so that it was not likely he
should ever be undeceived.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 20.—We have just re∣ceived
a very odd piece of news, that I own
has a little alarmed me. It is, that the wi∣dow
of Mr. Arnold's brother is found to be
with child. There was no mention of this
at the time her husband died, nor indeed
any cause to suspect it; but the strongest
presumptions in the world to the contrary,
as her husband and she lived a-part. It has
not been even whispered, 'till since our ar∣rival
in town. The lady pretends that she
was not conscious of it herself 'till within
this fortnight; yet her husband has been
dead four months. This I am told is very
possible, though not very common. She
has herself wrote a letter to Mr. Arnold, to
inform him of it; at the same time de∣claring,
that she and her late husband had
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
been reconciled a little before his death;
and that, had he recovered, she was to have
lived with him again. All this is very strange.
The elder Mr. Arnold killed himself with
excessive drinking. His death approached
him by slow degrees; but as he could never
be persuaded to think it near, he took not
the least care either of his spiritual or tem∣poral
concerns. His brother was in the
country when he was seized with his last
illness, which he had precipitated by some
extravagant excess. He was almost at the
last extremity before he could be prevailed
on to let a physician attend him, or suffer
his brother to be sent for. In regard to the
latter, he told those about him, that as he
was his heir, of course he had made no will.
He mentioned not his wife. The jointure
which had been settled on her, he allowed
her for a separate maintenance. They had for
a long time pursued separate pleasures, and
none of his friends knew that they had ever
met, or so much as seen one another from
the time they parted. My Mr. Arnold ar∣rived
in town just time enough to close his
brother's eyes; he was speechless when he
came, and expired in less than an hour after
he entered his chamber.</P>
<P>As his wife had been very obnoxious to
the family, there was little notice taken of
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
her by them, more than what common forms
require. She seemed as indifferent about the
death of her husband, as she had been to∣wards
him in his life-time; and did not then
hint a word of this reconciliation between
them, or of her having had an interview
with him. I am told, she is a very weak,
as well as a very loose woman; and Mr.
Arnold thinks she has got into the hands of
some designing person. However that mat∣ter
may be, it is a serious affair; and he de∣signs
to take the opinion of an eminent law∣yer
upon it. My poor dear mother is frightned
sadly. If this child should make its appear∣ance
in the world time enough to prove
the possibility of its being the offspring of the
late Mr. Arnold, she says, it must be consi∣dered
by the law as his heir, notwithstanding
the husband and wife lived apart. Mr. Ar∣nold
laughs, or affects to laugh at this; we
shall, however, wait with patience 'till the
lady is brought to-bed.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 25.—Our house is intirely
fitted up, and we shall remove into it this
evening; my mother chuses to continue in
her own, though Mr. Arnold presses her to
accept of an apartment in ours; but we shall
be near neighbours, and she does not like to
change.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="186"/>
We have received the opinion of our
lawyers, who tell us, that in case the child
should be born within such a period of time,
as to give colour to its claim, yet the lady
must prove her assertion, in regard to the
pretended meeting between her and her hus∣band;
which it is imagined is not in her
power to do; and her indifferent character,
together with several favourable circum∣stances
which Mr. Arnold has on his side,
makes them quite sanguine in their expec∣tations
of overturning her claim. We are,
however, likely to be engaged in a disagree∣able
law-suit; but as Mr. Arnold seems per∣fectly
easy about the issue of it, I will make
myself so too.</P>
<P><HI>December 10.</HI>—I am more and more
reconciled to my lot, my dear Cecilia, every
day that I live. Mr. Arnold's assiduity and
tenderness towards me deserve the gratefullest
return my heart can make him; and I am
convinced it is not necessary to be passionate∣ly
in love with the man we marry, to make
us happy. Constancy, good sense, and a
sweet temper, must form a basis for a dura∣ble
felicity. The two latter I am sure Mr.
Arnold possesses; Oh! may I never experi∣ence
his want of the former! I hope my own
conduct will for ever ensure to me his love.
That only can secure the tranquillity of my
future Days.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187"/>
<HI>December</HI> 11.—My brother arrived in
town last night; and came this morning in
company with my mother (and I am sure at
her request) to make us a formal visit. My
kind Mr. Arnold received him with tender∣ness;
Sir George was coldly polite. He
owned, however, to my mother, upon her
asking him his opinion of his brother-in-law,
that he seemed to be a <HI>good clever sort of a
fellow.</HI> I wish I could cultivate a friendship
between them; it will not be Mr. Arnold's
fault if there is not; but Sir George, you
know, is not of a very pliant disposition.</P>
<P>He asked my mother, when they were
alone, Whether she had yet seen Miss B. or
Mrs. Jefferis (for he knew her by no other
name) and what she had to say for herself?
My mother told him, he had better not touch
upon that string. I will be hanged, replied
Sir George, if the artful young baggage has
not imposed upon you. My mother, who
is always angry at having her sagacity called
in question, told Sir George he was rude, and
she should give him no satisfaction on that
head. My brother answered, as it was <HI>now</HI>
of no consequence, what the wench affirmed
or denied, he had no farther curiosity about
her. My mother called him a bear, and so
the enquiry ended.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"/>
<HI>December</HI> 20.—I congratulate you,
my sister, my friend, my ever beloved Ce∣cilia.
Happy! happy may you be in your
nuptials! but in the midst of my joy for
your being so nobly and so worthily bestow∣ed,
self-love forces a sigh from me. I have
lost the pleasing hope of seeing you, at the
time fixed for your return. The station your
husband holds at the court of Vienna, will,
I fear, long detain my beloved in a foreign
land. But you are not amongst strangers;
a husband, a brother, and tender parent,
must make every part of the globe equally
your home. I will therefore seek for my
contentment in your's, and rest satisfied with
believing that you will always continue to
love me.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 10, 1703-4.—I begin to find
my thoughts so much dissipated, that I am
angry with myself; Mr. Arnold's excessive
indulgence will spoil me; he is always con∣triving
new scenes of pleasure, and hurries
me from one to the other. I do not wish
to be perpetually fluttering about. The
calm domestic life you know was always my
choice; but I will not oppose my kind Mr.
Arnold in his fond desire of pleasing me:
besides, I find that by his constantly gallant∣ing
me to public places, he begins himself
to acquire a sort of relish for them, which
he did not use to have; at least his prudence
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
made him so to conform to the necessity of
his circumstances, while his fortune was
small, that he never indulged himself in
any of the fashionable expensive amusements;
nor does he now in any, but such as I par∣take
of with him. I find he is by nature
open and liberal to excess. I must take
care, without his being conscious of it, to
be a gentle check upon his bounteous spirit;
I mean only so far as it regards myself: in∣deed
this is the most material point, for in
every other instance his generosity is regu∣lated
by prudence. I am every hour more
obliged to him, and should hate myself if
I did not find that he had an entire possession
of my love.</P>
<P>Sir George hardly ever comes near us but
by formal invitation, and then his behaviour
to Mr. Arnold is so very civil, and so very
distant, that it mortifies me exceedingly.
Mr. Arnold cannot but perceive it; but
either his tenderness for me makes him take
no notice of it, or else, not being well e∣nough
acquainted with my brother to know
his disposition, he may impute his coldness
to his natural temper.</P>
<P>My mother says, he never names Mr.
Faulkland or Miss Burchell to her. I wish
Sir George could entirely forget that unhap∣py
affair.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190"/>
<HI>February</HI> 1.—There is a story propa∣gated
by the widow Arnold, about the meet∣ing
between her and her husband; the cir∣cumstances
of which are as follows:</P>
<P>She says, she had dined one day in the
city, and was returning home to her lodgings
in York-buildings in a hackney-coach; that
the driver, by his carelessness in coming
along the Strand, had one of his fore-wheels
taken off by a waggon, which accident
obliged her to alight: the footboy, who was
behind the coach, had by the jolt been
thrown off, and received a hurt, which
made it necessary to have him carried into
a shop for assistance. That the lady herself,
being no otherwise injured than by a little
fright, found that she was so near, home,
that she did not think it worth while to wait
for another carriage, but pursued her way on
foot. It was a fine dry evening, about nine
o'clock; and though there was no light but
what the lamps afforded, yet as the streets
were full of people, she had no apprehensions
of danger.</P>
<P>In this situation she was accosted by two
gentlemen, who, seeing a lady well dressed
and alone; insisted on seeing her safe to her
lodgings. However disagreeable such an en∣counter
was, she said she did not give herself
much concern about it, as she was so near
home, and expected to shake off her new
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
acquaintance at the door of the house where
he lodged; and accordingly, when she got
there, she told them she was at home, and
wished them a good night; but the imper∣tinents
were not so easily to be put off. The
door having been opened by the maid of the
house, they both rushed in; her landlady, a
single woman, happened to be abroad, and
there was no man in the house.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold thought she had no way left,
but to run up to her dining-room, and lock
herself in; but in this she was prevented, as
the gentlemen, whom the servant of the
house vainly endeavoured to oppose, got up
stairs almost as soon as she did. Her own
maid, on hearing the rap at the door, had
lighted candles in the dining-room; the two
sparks entered with her; but how was she
surprized to find that one of them was her
husband. Her fright, she said, had pre∣vented
her from discovering this sooner, as
she had not looked in either of their faces,
though there was a light in the hall; and
Mr. Arnold's being half drunk, she supposed,
was the reason of his not perceiving sooner
who she was.</P>
<P>The astonishment that they both were in,
and the exclamation that each made in their
turn, soon informed the companion of Mr.
Arnold who the lady was. He congratu∣lated
them both on this fortunate mistake,
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
and saying, since chance had been so pro∣pitious
to Mr. Arnold as to throw him into
the arms of so charming a woman, he
hoped his discovering her to be his wife,
would not render her the less agreeable to
him; but that this unexpected meeting
might be a means of re-uniting them in their
former amity.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold, she says, in the presence of
this gentleman, advanced with open arms
to embrace her, which she not declining,
his friend having again felicitated them on
their reconciliation, took his leave, and Mr.
Arnold remained with his lady.</P>
<P>That at parting, which was not 'till late,
(as she would not, on account of her repu∣tation,
permit him to pass the night at her
lodgings) he promised to bring her home
to his house in a day or two; but unfortu∣nately
for her he was taken ill in the interim,
which she did not know of, 'till she had an
account that Mr. Arnold had lost his senses.
The reason she assigned for not enquiring af∣ter
him sooner was, that her pride would not
suffer her to make any advances to a man,
who had been so injurious as to part with
her; and she thought it his duty to recall
her, without her taking any step towards
it.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193"/>
This story seems plausible; yet none of
our friends believe a word of it, and ima∣gine
somebody has contrived it for her.
The gentleman, who was the companion of
Mr. Arnold that night, she says, can at a
proper time be produced as a witness, as also
her own maid, who can testify the truth of
this story. In the mean time this maid is
kept out of the way, and nobody can guess
at the gentleman, for his name is kept a pro∣found
secret.</P>
<P>I am delighted at the sweetness of Mr.
Arnold's temper: vexatious as this affair
is likely to be, even at the best, he does
not suffer it to interrupt our pleasures or
his own good humour. On the contra∣ry,
he is the more studious of promoting
every thing, which he thinks will entertain
me.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 28.—At length the poor Miss
Burchell is happily rid of her burthen; a
pretty little boy, my mother says it is: it
was, immediately after its birth, at which
my mother was present, privately baptized
by the name of Orlando, and sent away
with its nurse, a careful body, who had been
before provided for it. It passes for the son
of a captain Jefferis, abroad with the army.
Miss Burchell would never suffer the nurse
to see her; for as she intends to reassume
her own name, as soon as she shall be in a
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
condition to leave her present retirement,
she would chuse not to be known by the
woman, in case of her going to see her
child. Every thing was managed with
so much privacy, and Miss Burchell has
lived so perfectly recluse, nobody ever vi∣siting
her but my mother, that in all proba∣bility
this affair will always remain an entire
secret.</P>
<P>My mother says, that as soon as Miss
Burchell (to whom she considers herself as
a kind of patroness) is tolerably recovered,
she will go down to Sidney-castle; for she
thinks herself in a strange land any where
but there. And would you believe, it my
dear, she has taken such a fancy to Miss
Burchell, that she talks of inviting her down
with her, if she can obtain her uncle's leave.
The girl must certainly have some very ami∣able
qualities, so to captivate my mother, or
she has an immensity of art. I dare say the
young lady will gladly accept of her invita∣tion;
it will undoubtedly be a most eligible
situation for her. I do not know what Sir
George may say to her carrying her humanity
so far, as he hates the name of this poor
girl; but no matter, it may be a means of
preserving her character, which probably she
might not long keep, if she returned to live
with so vile a woman as I conclude her aunt
to be; nor can she have any colour for
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
quitting her, whilst her uncle lives; for I
find she is an orphan, and has no relation
but him. She must however go home for a
while, in order to get leave from him for this
visit to Sidney-castle.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26, 1704.—I am told the
widow Arnold computes the time of her ly∣ing-in
about the latter end of the next
month; if it should so happen, she saves
her distance, as her husband died in July,
a little before we went to Grimston-hall.
Mr. Arnold treats the affair very lightly, and
is only concerned at seeing my mother so
much affected by it. For my part, I form
my behaviour upon Mr. Arnold's conduct;
and as long as he appears easy, I shall certain-be
so too.</P>
<P>My brother throws out some unkind re∣flections:
he says, he wonders the old Sybil
at Grimston-hall did not foresee this; and
congratulates me on my good fortune, in
having my jointure settled on that part of
the estate which is not disputed. I really
think he shews a sort of ill-natured triumph
even in his condolements; for he generally
concludes them with thanking his stars that <HI>he</HI>
had no hand in the match. I trust in God we
shall none of us have any cause to repent it.
I am sure I never shall; for if Mr. Arnold
were reduced to the lowest ebb of fortune, I
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
should find my consolation in his kindness
and affection.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 27.—My mother is preparing
to leave town. Miss Burchell is quite reco∣vered,
and proposes going down to the
country to obtain her uncle's consent for the
intended visit. She says, she can easily tell
him she made an acquaintance with lady Bi∣dulph
in her late excursion to Bath, from
whom she received an invitation, and she is
sure he will not refuse to let her accept it.</P>
<P>Sir George laughs exceedingly at this plan.
He says his mother ought not to be sur∣prized
at Faulkland's falling into the girl's
snares, since she herself has done the same;
but he supposes my mother thinks she is
doing a very meritorious action, in affording
an asylum to this injured innocence. I give
you my brother's words, for I assure you,
as to myself, I approve of my mother's
kindness to her, and think it may be a
means of preserving the girl from future
mischief.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2.—Miss Burchell is gone into
the country, and this morning, for the first
time, severed me from the best of mother's.
I cannot recover my spirits; I have wept all
day. Mr. Arnold, ever good and obliging,
would needs accompany her some miles on
her journey; you may be sure I was not left
behind. Sir George was so polite as to say,
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
He would escorte her down to Sidney-castle.
I was surprized at it; for he does not often
do obliging things. My mother gladly ac∣cepted
of his company, and said, she would
make him her prisoner, when she had him
there; for she should be quite melancholy
without me for a time. Now though I
should be very unwilling not to allow the
merit of a good-natured action to Sir George,
yet do I attribute this in some measure to its
answering a purpose of convenience to him∣self.
You know, before his illness sent him
to the Spa, he always spent his summers
with us at the Castle, though he has another
very convenient house on his estate. When
he was in London, he never had any thing
but lodgings, for which I have often been
angry with him. My mother, since his re∣turn,
made him a compliment of her house;
but as the time she took it for is now ex∣pired,
and it is let to another family, he
could no longer continue in it. Mr. Arnold,
in the most affectionate manner, pressed him
to accept of an apartment with us, which
he declined. Now as he could not, without
shewing us an apparent slight, continue in
town in other lodgings, I believe he, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
reason, preserred going down with my mo∣ther.
Be it as it may, I am very glad that she
will have his company; for I make no doubt
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
of his staying with her some time, unless
miss Burchell should frighten him away.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5.—I have been so cast down
since my mother's departure, that Mr. Ar∣nold's
obliging tender assiduity to please and
entertain me seems redoubled; but indeed I
am wearied with a continual round of noisy
pleasures, and long to get back to Arnold-abbey.
I hope to be there in about three
weeks, or a month at farthest. My mother
has dispensed with our going down to her
this summer. She thinks it might be attend∣ed
with inconveniencies to me, and talks of
coming to town again in a few months; but
I shall insist on her not giving herself the fa∣tigue
of so long a journey, unless she comes to
stay all the next winter with us.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20.—My mother writes me
word that Miss Burchell has obtained leave
of her uncle, and is come to Sidney-castle:
she says, she never saw a better behaved
young creature. Sir George has taken so
much offence at her coming, that he talks of
going to his own house. My mother adds,
“He behaves, however, with manners, but I
shall not press him to stay.”</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6.—An important birth, my
Cecilia! the widow Arnold has produced a
young miss. I assure you the little damsel
has been ushered into life with all the cere∣mony
due to a young heiress; and her mother
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
introduces her as one, whom an unjust
uncle debars of her right. Now you must
know, that upon an exact calculation, this
little girl has made her appearance just twelve
days later than she ought to have done, to
prove her legitimacy, dating the possibility
of her being Mr. Arnold's, from the very
day whereon he took that illness of which he
died, and which confined him for five days
to his bed. In all that time his servants ne∣ver
lest him for a minute; this has occasion∣ed
various speculations; our lawyers say,
that it is enough to destroy her pretensions;
but some physicians, who have been consult∣ed
on the occasion, are of a contrary opini∣on;
and declare they have known instances
of children being born, even so long after
the stated time allotted by nature for their
coming into life.</P>
<P>It is a very unlucky affair, and has in∣volved
us in a law-suit. Who the person is,
that secretly abets the widow, we cannot
find out; but it is certain she has somebody;
every one believes this is an infamous and
unjust claim; and the woman's folly almost
frees her from the suspicion of its being of
her own cont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iving.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 10.—You cannot imagine my Ceci∣lia,
how happy I think myself, after such a
hurrying winter as I have had, to find my∣self
once more restored to my favourite plea∣sures,
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
the calm delights of solitude. Ar∣nold-abbey
seems a paradise to me now.</P>
<P>Lady Grimston shewed me a specimen of
her humour this morning, in talking of the
widow Arnold. She said she was an <HI>harlot,</HI>
that having already disgraced the family,
now wanted to beggar them; but that if
Mr. Arnold did not make an example of
her, she would never own him for a kins∣man.</P>
<P>My chearful old Dean says, he is now
completely happy, having lived to see his
daughter married (while we were in town)
very much to his and her satisfaction. I
am heartily glad of it, neither am I sorry
(for her sake) that she has left the country.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 11.—Mrs. Vere is come to spend
a few weeks with me according to her pro∣mise.
She is a truly amiable creature; her
disposition is so gentle, her temper so mild,
such a sweet humility in her whole deport∣ment,
that it astonishes me her mother can
still persist in her unkindness to her. But
the eldest daughter was always her darling,
who, I understand, is pretty much of her
mother's own cast; and makes a very ter∣magant
wife to a very turbulent husband.
So that notwithstanding their title (for he is
a baronet) and immense riches, they are a
very miserable pair.</P>

They were lately to pay lady Grimston a
visit; but there happened such a frecas, that
probably it may be the last she will ever re∣ceive
from them. The husband it seems, tho'
very rough and surly in his nature, is, not∣withstanding,
a well-meaning man, and not
void of humanity; which had induced him
to give a small portion to a young girl, a
distant relation of his own, who had been
left an orphan. She was beloved by the son
of a substantial farmer, a tenant of the ba∣ronet's,
and had an equal affection for him;
but the young man depending entirely on
his father for his future prospects, durst not
take a wife without something to begin the
world with; for his father had just put him
into the management of one of his farms.
The young lady and her mother (who was a
widow, and is but lately dead) had boarded
for some years at this honest farmer's house,
and in that time a mutual love had been con∣tracted
between the young people. The old
man himself liked the girl so well for a
daughter-in-law, that his only objection was
her want of fortune; but this was such an
obstacle as was not to be surmounted by a
man, who, being accustomed to earn mo∣ney
by indefatigable industry, put the utmost
value upon it. His regard to his son's hap∣piness,
however, made him resolve to try
an experiment in his favour, and accordingly
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
he plucked up courage, and went to his land∣lord.
He told him, in his own blunt way,
that he came to speak to him in behalf of
a poor young gentlewoman that was his (Sir
William's) relation. I have a son that loves
her, said he, and she loves him, but I
cannot afford to let the boy marry a wife that
has nothing; and you know she has no por∣tion.
I would not desire much with her,
for she is a good girl, and very housewifely;
but if you will be so kind to give her some∣thing
to set them a going a little, I shall be
content; if not you will be the cause of my
son's losing a wife, for he swears he will ne∣ver
marry any other woman, and she, poor
thing, may pine away for love. I do not
desire this match out of the ambition of
having my boy related to you, but because I
think the girl is an honest girl, and may make
him happy.</P>
<P>The rough honesty of the farmer pleased
his landlord so well, that he gave the young
woman five hundred pounds to set them a
going, as the old yeoman termed it. Tho'
this sum was but a trifle to a man of his for∣tune,
and the giving it was a praise-worthy
action, yet did it exceedingly displease his lady,
especially as he had not thought proper to con∣sult
her on the occasion. She was not contented
with venting her indignation on her husband
at home, but she renewed the quarrel, by
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
complaining to lady Grimston, that her
opinion and advice were not only despised,
but that Sir William was lavishing away the
fortune <HI>she</HI> had brought him, upon a <HI>tribe</HI> of
poor relations of his own. Lady Grimston
immediately took fire; she could not bear
the thoughts of having her daughter's au∣thority
of less weight in his family, than her
own had been, and she attacked her son-in-law
with acrimony on the subject. His an∣swer
to her was short. Look ye, lady
Grimston, you made a very obstreperous
wife to a very peaceable husband; your
daughter, I find, is mightily disposed to
follow your example; but as I am not quite
so tame as my father-in-law was, I will suffer
her to see as little of it as may be. With this
he turned from her, and ordering his coach
and six to be got ready immediately, with
very little ceremony he forced his wife into it,
and carried her home directly, leaving lady
Grimston foaming with rage. The alterca∣tion
had been carried on with so little cauti∣on,
that the servants heard it, and the story
is the jest of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I confess I am not sorry for this breach; it
may be the better for poor Mrs. Vere; for
tho' her mother's jointure reverts to a male
relation, on whom the estate was settled, yet
as lady Grimston has a large personal fortune,
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
it is in her power to make her daughter full
amends for the injury she did her.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20—Mr. Arnold is improving
his gardens, and taking in a great deal more
ground to enlarge them. I do not express
the least dissatisfaction at this, though I own
I could wish he would not engage in new ex∣pences
on an estate which is now in litigation;
but our lawyers are so sanguine, that they en∣courage
him to proceed.</P>
<P><HI>[The following is writ in the hand of the
lady, who gave the editor these papers:
“Here follows an interval of four months;
in which time, though the journal was
regularly continued, nothing material to
her story occurred, but the birth of a
daughter, after which she proceeds.”]</HI></P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 25.—How delightful are the
sensations, my dear Cecilia, that I feel hour∣ly
springing in my heart! Surely the tender∣ness
of a mother can never be sufficiently
repaid; and I now more than ever rejoice in
having, by an obedience, which perhaps I
once thought had some little merit in it, con∣tributed
so much to the repose of a parent,
to whom I have such numberless obligations.
I never see my dear little girl, but I think
such were the tender sentiments, the sweet
anxieties, that my honoured and beloved
mother felt when her Sidney was such a brat
as this. Then I say, surely I have a right to
all the duty, all the filial love that this crea∣ture
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
can shew me, in return for my fond∣ness.
As for Mr. Arnold, he idolizes it;
you never saw so good a nurse as he makes.
Lady Grimston declares, we are both in a
fair way of ruining the child, and advises
us to send it out of the house, that we may
not grow too fond of it: but we shall hard∣ly
take her counsel.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.—I informed you be∣fore
that Miss Burchell had been summoned
home by her uncle, who was then very ill.
She has lately written an account to my mo∣ther
of his death; and that as she has now her
fortune in her own hands, she intends im∣mediately
to quit her aunt, and look out for
some genteel and reputable family in Lon∣don
(where it seems she chuses to reside) to
lodge with.</P>
<P>My mother, in her letter to me, expresses
great satisfaction at her resolution to leave
her aunt, but is not without her fears, that
so pretty a young woman, left to her own
guidance, may be liable to danger; though
she thinks both her natural disposition, and
her good sense, sufficient to guard her against
actual evil.</P>
<P>Our lawyer writes us word, that he has
had an offer of a composition, proposed by
the widow Arnold's people: he says, though
the sum they mention is a very round one,
yet it plainly indicates the weakness of their
hopes; and concludes with telling Mr. Ar∣nold,
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
that if six-pence would buy them off,
he should not, with his consent, give it to
them; as it would tacitly admit the legality
of their claim, and might be productive of
troublesome consequences hereafter; and
therefore he would by all means have the
issue fairly tried. Mr. Arnold laughs hear∣tily
at the proposal, but says he is very much
obliged to the lady for condescending to
give up more than half, when her daughter
has a right to the whole; without whose
consent he supposes it is not in the mother's
power to make terms.</P>
<P>I wish we were rid of this troublesome
affair, as it must hurry us to town sooner
than we intended, and the country is still
delightful.</P>
<P><HI>London, October</HI> 1.—Again we have
quitted our sweet retirement for the noise
and bustle of London; but this law business,
it seems, must be closely pursued, though
our antagonist's motions seem a little dilato∣ry.
We cannot find out the secret spring
that sets the machine a going; the wheels
however do not seem to move with such
alacrity as they did; though the widow
still talks big, and says, we shall repent of
having rejected her offer.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3.—My brother is arrived in
town, but took care to settle himself in
handsome commodious lodgings before he
paid us a visit, for fear, I suppose, that we
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
should again press him to accept of apart∣ments
in our house. I see he is determined
to keep up nothing more than an intercourse
barely civil. Mr. Arnold cannot but be
disgusted with his behaviour, but he is too
delicate to take notice of it to me.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7.—I am disappointed in my
hopes of seeing my dear mother in town
this winter. Her apartment was ready for
her, and I delighted myself with the thoughts
of seeing her in possession of it, at least for
a few months; but she writes me word that
her old rheumatick complaint is returned
on her with such violence, that she cannot
think of undertaking the journey. Sadly
am I grieved at this news, and shall long
to have the winter over, that Mr. Arnold
and I may fly to Sidney-castle; he has pro∣mised
me this satisfaction early in the sum∣mer.</P>
<P>My mother informs me that Miss Bur∣chell
constantly corresponds with her: she
tells her that her aunt is come to town to
sollicit for her pension, but that she never
sees her; and as she means to drop all cor∣respondence
with her, she does not intend
even to let her know where she lodges.
I commend Miss Burchell highly for this,
as the acquaintance of such a woman may
be hurtful to her reputation.</P>
<P><HI>[Here ensues another interval of nine
months, in which nothing particular is re∣lated,
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
but that Mrs. Arnold became mother
to a second child. This last circumstance,
with a few others preceding and succeeding
that event, are related in the Journal by
her maid Patty; after which Mrs. Ar∣nold
herself proceeds.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 1, 1705.—Again, my dear Ce∣cilia,
I am able to reassume my pen. I
have read what Patty has writ, and find
she is admirable at the anecdotes of a nur∣sery.
Am I not rich, think you? Two
daughters, and both perfect beauties, and
great wits you may be sure!</P>
<P>The new-born damsel was baptized this
day by the dear-loved name of Cecilia. I
am angry with Mr. Arnold, he takes so
little notice of this young stranger; his af∣fections
are all engaged by Dolly: indeed,
I am almost jealous of her; for he spends
most of the time he is at home in the
nursery.</P>
<P>Our antagonist is grown alert again, and
has renewed her efforts, which we thought
began to flag a little, with fresh vigour.
Whence she derives those revived hopes
is still a mystery; but she now says, she
would not accept of a composition if it
were offered. My poor Mr. Arnold be∣gins
to fret a little, it now and then makes
him thoughtful; not that he says he has the
least doubt about his success, but he has
been much harrassed with the necessary at∣tendance
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
that the cause requires, and down∣right
tired with dangling after lawyers; be∣sides,
they say the cause cannot come to an
hearing in the ensuing term, though they
before made us hope, that it would be at
an end long before this time.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 3.—I am mortified exceedingly,
my dear Cecilia: I find I am not likely to
see my mother this summer. I thought I
could not have lived so long from her
sight. Indeed it was purely in the hope of
making her this visit, that I prevented her
coming to town in the spring, which she
purposed doing, though far from being well
enough to undertake the journey. I own I
have been impatient under my confinement,
as that, and my previous circumstances, de∣tained
us so long in town, and I this day
asked Mr. Arnold when we should set out
for Sidney-castle. He answered me, that
he feared it would not be in his power this
season to pay the intended visit to my mo∣ther:
he says, he has not been near his
estate in Kent these five years, except for a
day or two at a time, and that he thinks it
necessary to see what condition it is in. I
believe I have told you that there is a pretty
house on it. The place is called South-park,
and is that which my mother chose for my
settlement. Mr. Arnold, who always pre∣ferred
Arnold-abbey to it, hardly ever vi∣sited
this place; and as he never resided
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
there, and only lay at an inn when he went
down, the house is unfurnished, excepting
a room or two, which a man who receives
his rent has just made habitable for his own
convenience.</P>
<P>But that I have laid it down as a rule
never to oppose so good, so indulgent a
husband as Mr. Arnold is, in any instance,
wherein I do not think a superior duty re∣quires
me to do so, I should certainly
shew some disapprobation of what he now
purposes doing. It will be attended with
so much trouble, so much expence too: he
has ordered the house at South-park to be
completely furnished, and says, he hopes I
shall like it so well as to be induced to pass
the remainder of the summer there. Most
sure it is, every place will be delightful to
me where I can enjoy his company, and
have my dear little babes with me; but me∣thinks
two country houses are an unnecessary
charge, and more than suits our fortune. I
pray God this tender husband may not have
a strong and prudent reason for this conduct,
which out of kindness he conceals; perhaps
he thinks this little spot at South-park may
some time hence be the whole of our de∣pendence,
and he has a mind to be before∣hand
with ill fortune, in rendering that re∣treat
agreeable to me, and rather an object
of choice than of necessity. If this be his
motive, How much am I obliged to him?
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
He has not hinted any thing like it; nor
would I dash the pleasure he seems to pro∣mise
himself there, by insinuating the least
suspicion of what his reasons are for going to
it. If we lose Arnold-abbey, and the whole
estate belonging to it, I shall only regret it
for his sake.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.—We are to set out to-mor∣row,
my Cecilia, for our place in Kent. I
have made the best apology that I could to
my mother, and Mr. Arnold too has writ to
her; but I know she will be extremely dis∣appointed
at not seeing us.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 12.—We are safely arrived at
South-park, Mr. Arnold in high spirits,
and my two young travellers bore the fa∣tigue
extremely well.</P>
<P>I am not surprized that Mr. Arnold liked
the old family seat better than this. I
cannot say I am much charmed with it,
but I will not let him see that. I affect to
admire, and seem pleased with every thing
that affords me the least opportunity of
commendation. The house is a very neat
one; it has not been many years built, and is
in perfectly good repair. It is genteelly,
though plainly furnished, and we have a
tolerable garden; but as the whole domain
is let, we are obliged to take a few fields
from one of our tenants, to supply our im∣mediate
want. We are in a very genteel
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
and populous neighbourhood, and within
a mile of a good market town.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20.—I have regretted nothing
so much in my absence from Arnold-abbey,
as the being cut off from the hope of seeing
my amiable Mrs. Vere. We can have
but <HI>one friend</HI> to share our heart, to whom
we have no reserve, and whose loss is irre∣parable;
but I perceive the absence of a plea∣sing
acquaintance, whose society is no farther
necessary to us, than as it contributes to enliv∣en
solitude, and gets a preference to others
merely by comparison, is a loss easily sup∣plied;
this I find by experience. There
are Mrs. Veres every where; but, alas!
there is but <HI>one</HI> Cecilia!</P>
<P>I was visited to-day by two ladies that I
am charmed with, though it is the first
time I have seen either of them. The one
is lady V. of whom you have formerly
heard. Her Lord and she came together;
their seat is within a mile of us, and Mr.
Arnold had a slight acquaintance with lord
V. before. My lady is about forty, and has
that kind of countenance that at once invites
your confidence; I never saw integrity, be∣nevolence,
and good sense, more strongly
pictured in a face; her address is so plain,
so perfectly free from affectation, or any of
the little supercilious forms of ceremony,
that a person ignorant of what politeness
consists in, would imagine she wanted breed∣ing;
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
yet she received her education in a
court; but she seems to let good sense and
good nature preside over all her words and
actions rather than form. She told me she
had deserred her visit to me, longer perhaps
than the laws of decorum would admit of,
as we were such near neighbours; but,
said she, I was determined not to be over∣looked
in the crowd of visitors that have
been thronging to you every day, since you
came down. The character I have heard
of you, makes me wish for an intimacy
with you, and you are not to look upon
this as a visit of ceremony, but as an ad∣vance
towards that friendship I wish to
cultivate.</P>
<P>She spoke this with so frank an air, that
flattering as the compliment appeared, I
could not help believing her sincere; and
thought myself, that my appearance did
not diminish that good opinion which she
said she had conceived of me from report.</P>
<P>Lord V—is many years older than his
lady; a robust man, as plain in his way as
my lady is in her's; though <HI>his</HI> way and
<HI>her's</HI> are very different; for he is frank
even to bluntness, but the best humoured
man living.</P>
<P>The other lady whom I mentioned is a
widow; her name is Gerrarde, and she
lives upon a little estate she has in this neigh∣bourhood.
I think I never beheld so fine a
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
creature; she is about six and twenty; her
stature, which is much above the common
size, is rendered perfectly graceful and ma∣jestic
by one of the finest shapes in the
world; if her grace is not altogether so re∣gularly
beautiful as her person, it is, how∣ever,
handsome enough to render any wo∣man
charming who had nothing else to boast
of. Whether her understanding be of a
piece with the rest, I have not yet been able
to discover. Her visit to me was but short,
for she had not sat with me an hour when
lady V—came in, and she then took her
leave; but by what I could observe in that
little time, she seems to have as much viva∣city
and agreeable humour, as I ever met
with in any one. She pressed me to dine
with her at her cottage, as she calls it, to∣morrow,
and I like her too well to refuse
the invitation.</P>
<P>These two charming women, I think, I
shall single out for my chief intimates, from
the crowd which have been to compliment
me, on my coming into this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold is mightily pleased with them
both; but he gives the preference to lady
V—, whom, tho' he had a slight acquaint∣ance
with her lord, he never saw before.
But he is almost as great a stranger in this
place as I am: he is highly delighted at my
having met with people who are likely to
render it agreeable to me.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>
<HI>July</HI> 21.—We dined to day accord∣ing
to appointment with Mrs. Gerrarde. A
cottage she called her house, nor does it
appear much better at the outside, but
within it is a fairy palace. Never was any
thing so neat, so elegant, so perfectly well
fansied, as the fitting up of all her rooms.
Her bedchambers are furnished with fine
chintzs, and her drawing-room with the
prettiest Indian sattin I ever saw. Her lit∣tle
villa is called Ashby, and her husband,
she told me, purchased it for her some time
before his death, and left it to her; but
she has since had a considerable addition to
her fortune, by the death of a relation.</P>
<P>Our entertainment was splendid almost to
profusion, though there was no company
but Mr. Arnold and I. I told her, if she
always gave such dinners, it would frighten
me away from her: indeed it was the only
circumstance in her whole conduct that
did not please me, for I was charmed
with the rest of her behaviour. They must
surely be of a very churlish disposition, who
are not pleased, where a manifest desire to
oblige is conspicuous in every word and ac∣tion.
If Mrs. Gerrarde is not as highly
polished as some women are, who, perhaps,
have had a more enlarged education, she
makes full amends for it by a perfect good
humour, a sprightliness always entertaining,
and a quickness of thought, that gives her
conversation an air of something very <HI>like</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
wit, and which I dare say passes for the
thing itself with most people.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 24.—I have returned lady
V—'s visit, and am more delighted with
her than before. Mr. Arnold went with
me; but my lord not being at home, he
went to ramble about the grounds, so that
I had a long <HI>tete a tete</HI> with lady V—. She
is an admirable woman, so fine an under∣standing,
such delicacy of sentiment, and
such an unaffected complaisance in her man∣ner,
that I do not wonder my lord perfectly
adores her. There is a tenderness, a ma∣ternal
kindness in her behaviour towards
me, that fills me at once with love and re∣verence
for her; and next to my Cecilia, I
think I never met with any woman whom I
could so highly esteem as lady V—. She
is an admirable mistress of her needle, and
every room in her house exhibits some pro∣duction
of a very fine genius, united with
very great industry: for there are beds,
chairs, and carpets, besides some very pretty
rural prospects in pannels, executed with
inimitable skill, and very excellent taste.
She tells me, if I will give her leave to
bring her work with her, she will live whole
days with me.</P>
<P>I am rejoiced now that Mr. Arnold
thought of coming to South-Park. How
valuable is the acquaintance of such a wo∣man
as lady V—! and I might never have
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
known her, but for a circumstance to which
I was at first so averse. And then my a∣greeable
lively Mrs. Gerrarde! My acquaint∣ance
at Arnold-abbey begin to fade upon
my memory: to say the truth, I think of
none of them with pleasure, but Mrs. Vere,
and my good humoured old Dean.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 4.—Mrs. Gerrarde is a little
fancy monopolist; she grumbles if I do not
see her every day, and is downright jealous
of my intimacy with lady V—. They are
acquainted, but I don't find there is a very
close intercourse between them: Mrs. Ger∣rarde
says, her ladyship is too good a house∣wife
for her; and as she is not very fond of
needle-work herself, she cannot endure peo∣ple
that are always poring over a frame. I
find indeed, that this sprightly rogue is fond∣er
of cards than of work: she draws Mr.
Arnold and me in very often for a pool at
picquet: at her house I am obliged to sub∣mit;
but at my own, I often take up a
book, when she and Mr. Arnold are engaged
at their game, and make them decide the
contest between them. Nay, I threaten
that I will, some night or other, steal to bed
and leave them; for she is unconscionable at
late hours; and as she lives very near us,
and keeps a chariot, she does not scruple to
go home at any hour of the night. What
a pity it is so amiable a woman should be
thus fondly attached to so unprofitable an
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
amusement! for I begin to see play is her
foible; though, to do her justice, she ne∣ver
engages but for very trifling sums, and
that only in our own little domestic way.
But this passion may grow upon her, and
she may be led unawares into the losing
more than her fortune can bear.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 12.—I was never so discon∣certed
as I have been this day: you will be
surprized when I tell you, it was by my
good lady V—. She came to pass the day
with me, Mr. Arnold being engaged abroad.</P>
<P>We were both sitting at work in the par∣lour:
lady V—had contiuned silent for a
good while; at last last looking at me with
a most benign smile, for I had at the same
instant cast my eyes at her; I was just then
thinking, my dear Mrs. Arnold, said she,
that I once (though perhaps you did not know
it) flattered myself with the hopes of being
related to you. Her words threw me into
confusion, though I did not know their mean∣ing.
It would have been both an honour
and a happiness to me, madam, I replied,
though I don't know by what means I was
ever likely to possess it. She continued
smiling, but seemed in suspence whether she
should proceed. You will pardon my curi∣osity,
my dear, said she, but give me leave
to ask, whether Mr. Arnold was not once
near losing the happiness he now enjoys? I
felt my face glow as she spoke. There was
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
once a treaty of marriage on foot, madam, be∣tween
me and another gentleman. I am sorry
I mentioned it, said my lady, observing my
confusion; but as I was no stranger to the
affair while it was transacting, and Mr.
Faulkland is a kinsman of mine, I hope you
will forgive my inquisitiveness; for I own I
have a curiosity, which I believe no body
but yourself can gratify; and if I did not
think you the most candid, as well as the
best tempered creature living, I durst not
push my enquiry. My lord, you are to
know, was in London, at the time Mr.
Faulkland was first introduced to you; and
as they are extremely fond of each other,
Mr. Faulkland did not scruple to disclose his
passion to him, nor the success it then ap∣peared
likely to be crowned with, giving
him at the same time such a character of you,
as I have since found you deserve.</P>
<P>When my lord returned to V—hall,
which he was obliged to do very soon after
Mr. Faulkland had made this discovery to
him, he informed me of the alliance my
cousin Faulkland was going to make; and
we were pleasing ourselves with the thoughts
of congratulating him on his happiness,
when we received a letter from him that put
an end to all our expectations; this letter
contained but four distracted lines: he told
my lord, in broken sentences, that he had
lost all hopes of Miss Bidulph; that an act
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
of indiscretion had been construed into a
capital crime; and that being banished from
the presence of the woman he adored, he was
immediately about to bid adieu to England,
perhaps for ever.</P>
<P>This was the substance of what he wrote
to us: we have heard from him since a few
times, but he never cleared up the matter to
us, nor even so much as mentioned it. I
have not been in London since; my lord
has; but he never could get any light into
the mystery; he heard from some of our
friends, who knew of the intended match,
that it was broke off, no body knew why.
There were, however, several idle surmises
thrown out; some laid the blame on Mr.
Faulkland, and some on you; but the truth
I believe remains still a secret. Now, my
dear, if my curiosity is improper, or if there
was any particular motive to this disappoint∣ment
of my kinsman's hopes, which you
don't chuse to reveal, forgive my enquiry,
and think no more of it; but take up that
book, and read to me while I work.</P>
<P>Though my lady gave me this kind oppor∣tunity
of evading her question, I did not lay
hold of it: I did not indeed chuse to reveal
the whole of this affair, because I did not
think myself at liberty to divulge Miss
Burchell's secret, however I might discover
my own. I told my lady in general terms,
that though Mr. Faulkland might pretend
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
to a lady every way my superior, yet there
was an objection to him of no small weight
with us; that my mother had been informed
of a very recent piece of gallantry he had
had with a person of some condition, and
that it had disgusted her so much, she could
not think of uniting me with a man whose
passions were not a little more staid; and
that this was the sole reason of her dislike to
a gentleman, who was in every other respect
unexceptionable. I am glad it was no worse,
said lady V—, smiling, I am sure Mr. Faulk∣land
is not capable of a <HI>base</HI> action; youth∣ful
follies he may have had, though I believe
as few even of those to answer for as most
men of his yea. I make not the least doubt,
however, that lady Bidulph was guided by
prudence in what she did. She certainly
could not be too cautious in the disposal of
<HI>such</HI> a child as you; and whatever Mr.
Faulkland's disappointment may be, <HI>you</HI> I
hope are happy. Lady V—looked at me
as she pronounced these words, with an in∣quisitive,
though tender regard. I was glad
of an opportunity of enlarging on the merits
of Mr. Arnold, and told her, I was as hap∣py
as my heart could wish, or the worthiest
of men could make me. I am glad of it,
said she, with a quickness in her voice; but
don't imagine, my dear Mrs. Arnold, (and
she took me by the hand) that I introduced
this conversation merely to gratify a curi∣osity,
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
which I fear you must condemn in
your private thoughts, though you have
been so good as to satisfy it: I had another
reason, a much stronger one. What is it,
dear madam? almost starting with apprehen∣sions
of I did not know what. Don't be
alarmed, said she, smiling, it is only this;
a great aunt of Mr. Faulkland's is lately dead,
who has left him a considerable personal
estate, and he is coming over to take posses∣sion
of it; otherwise I don't know when we
should have seen him in England. My lord
had a letter very lately from him; he was
then at Turin, where he had met with our
eldest son, who is now on his travels: he
told us he had letters and some tokens of
love to deliver to us from him; and that he
should immediately on his arrival in England
come to V—hall, where he would pass a
month with us. Now as we expect him
daily, I had a mind to apprize you of his in∣tended
visit, that you might not be sur∣prized,
by perhaps unexpectedly meeting
him at my house. I thanked her lady∣ship
for her obliging caution, tho' I thought
it had something in it that mortified me. I
told her, that though I should not seek to
renew my acquaintance with Mr. Faulkland,
yet had I no reason to avoid him. Lady V—,
who is extremely quick of apprehension, re∣plied,
without doubt, madam, you have
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
not; but you might be surprized at seeing
him notwithstanding.</P>
<P>She presently turned the discourse; but
made me happy the whole day, by that in∣exhaustible
fund of good sense and improving
knowledge, of which she is mistress.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold came not home 'till very late;
he complains that he is got into a knot of
acquaintance that like the bottle too well;
but I am sure his natural sobriety is such, that
it will not be in the power of example to
lead him into intemperance; though I am
vexed he has fallen into such acquaintance,
because I know drinking is disagreeable to
him: yet a country gentleman must some∣times
give a little into it, to avoid the cha∣racter
of being singular.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 22.—Surprized I was not, be∣cause
I came prepared; but I own I was
abashed, at seeing Mr. Faulkland to-day.
Mr. Arnold and I were invited to dine at
lord V—'s, and his lordship, and his
guest, came in from the fields where they
had been walking, just as we were ready to
sit down to table.</P>
<P>There happened to be a good deal more
company; Mr. Faulkland was not intro∣duced;
so that there was no room for any
thing constrained or improper of either side.
I presently recovered the little embarrass∣ment,
that his first entrance into the room
had occasioned, I am sure no body took
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
notice of it; for dinner being immediately
served, there was a sort of bustle in hurrying
out of the drawing-room. The crowd we
had at table destroyed all conversation; and
nothing particular was said during dinner.
Lady V—soon withdrew, and all her female
friends followed her. I observed she fre∣quently
glanced her penetrating eyes at Mr.
Faulkland while we were at table, but I did
not chuse to make any observations on him.
We had not been long seated at our coffee,
when four of the gentlemen slipped from their
company and came to us: these were Mr.
Arnold, Mr. Faulkland, and two others.
My lord is pretty free at his bottle, and none
of these gentlemen, I suppose, were fond
of that entertainment. Lady V—and I
were sitting on a couch: I called to Mr. Ar∣nold,
and placed him between us: Mr.
Faulkland approached me, and then, for
the first time, with a respectful distance, en∣quired
after my mother and Sir George, tell∣ing
me he had missed of the latter, when he
was in London, being told he was at Sidney-castle.
After a few more indifferent questi∣ons,
he took a dish of coffee, and retired
with it to a window. Mr. Arnold asked me
in a whisper, if I was acquainted with Mr.
Faulkland; I could only answer that I was
formerly very well acquainted with him.
Nothing more passed between Mr. Faulkland
and me the whole evening: he returned soon
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
to the company in the next room, and I saw
no more of him.</P>
<P>I can, with the utmost sincerity, assure
my Cecilia, that I now behold Mr. Faulk∣land
with as much indifference as I do any
other man of my acquaintance. Time,
joined to my own efforts, must, without
any other help, have entirely subdued an in∣clination
which was always restrained by pru∣dential
motives, and rendered subservient to
my duty; but I have, besides this, now ac∣quired
a shield that must render me invulne∣rable;
I mean the perfect and tender affection
I bear my husband: this has completely se∣cured
me against the most distant apprehen∣sions
of being alarmed from any other quar∣ter;
yet notwithstanding all this, I can't say
that I am quite satisfied at this renewal of my
acquaintance with Mr. Faulkland. I hope,
and indeed it is reasonable to suppose, that I
have now as little interest in <HI>his</HI> heart as he
has in mine: it is but natural to believe that
a gay young man like him, should not be so
weak as to nourish a hopeless passion for
more than two years, especially as he has
never once seen the object of it in all that
time; and must, without doubt, have had
his attention engaged to others in all likeli∣hood
much preferable to her; so that I think
I have reason to be as easy on his account as
on my own. But still am I disquieted in my
mind; I have a delicacy that takes alarm at
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
the veriest trifles, and has been a source of
pain to me my whole life-time: it makes
me unhappy to think that I am now under
an almost unavoidable necessity of some∣times
seeing and conversing with a man,
who once had such convincing proofs, that
he was not indifferent to me.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold's ignorance of our former
connections makes it still worse. At the
time I was so averse to his knowing any
thing of this affair, I flattered myself I should
never see Mr. Faulkland more, or at least
never be obliged to have any intercourse with
him; but I now lament that I did not take
my mother's advice, and disclose the whole
affair at first. Oh! my Cecilia, when the
smallest deviations from candor (which we
suppose discretion,) are thus punished with
remorse, what must they feel whose whole
life is one continued act of dissimulation? If
Mr. Arnold had been acquainted with my
former engagements, my heart would be
more at ease, and I should then converse
with this man with all the disengaged free∣dom
of a common friend. I wish Mr. Ar∣nold's
curiosity would excite him to ask me
some questions relative to my acquaintance
with Mr. Faulkland, that I might have an
opportunity of telling him the secret. But
the enquiry he made at lady V—'s was in a
careless manner; he was satisfied with my
reply, and spoke not of him since.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227"/>
You will laugh perhaps when I tell you
that I have not courage to mention it first:
Mr. Faulkland is reckoned a very fine gen∣tleman,
and I think it would have such an
air of vanity to tell my husband that I refused
him: then it would bring on such a train of
explanations, and poor Miss Burchell's histo∣ry
must come out; for a husband on such a
subject might be disgusted with concealments
of any kind; and I doubt whether even
some circumstances in my particular share of
this story might not displease him. In short,
I am bewildered, and know not what to wish
for; but must e'en let things take their
course, and rest satisfied in the integrity of
my own heart.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 26.—Oh! my dear, I am mor∣tified
to the last degree, lest Mr. Arnold
should, from some indiscreet tongue, have
received a hint of my former engagement;
he may think me disingenuous for never
having mentioned it, especially since Mr.
Faulkland has been in the neighbourhood:
I think his nature is too open to entertain any
suspicions essentially injurious to me; yet
may this affair, circumstanced as it is, make
an unfavourable impression on him. I wish
I had been before-hand with any officious
whisperer: he has got so many new ac∣quaintance,
and is so much abroad, that the
story may have reached his ears, God forbid
it should affect his mind with causeless unea∣siness!
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
finess I would Mr. Faulkland were a thou∣sand
miles from V—hall. I think Mr. Ar∣nold
is altered since his arrival there—
Colder he appears to be—I hope I but
<HI>fancy</HI> it—yet there <HI>is</HI> a change—his
looks are less kind—his voice has lost that
tenderness, that it used to have in speaking to
me—yet this may only be his temper—
a man cannot <HI>always</HI> be a lover—Oh! I
sicken at the very thought of Mr. Arnold's
entertaining a doubt of my true affection
for him. I would not live in this suspence
for millions. I would rather he should treat
me roughly—if I discovered that to be
his humour, though it would frighten me,
yet should I patiently conform to it.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 30.—That which was ever
the terror of my thoughts is come upon
me—Mr. Arnold—Ah! my dear Cecilia!
Mr. Arnold is no longer the same! Coldness
and indifference have at length succeeded to
love, to complacency, and the fondest atten∣tion—What
a change! but the <HI>cause,</HI> my
dear, That remains a secret locked up in his
own breast. I cannot believe that a whisper,
an idle rumour should affect him thus. What
if he <HI>has</HI> heard that Mr. Faulkland loved me
once? That we were to have been married?
Cannot he ask me the question? I long to set
his heart at ease—yet cannot mention the af∣fair
first, after so long a silence; it would
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
look like a consciousness. A consciousness
of what? I have nothing to accuse myself of.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1.—I am no longer in doubt.
—The cause, the fatal cause of Mr. Ar∣nold's
change is discovered. This misera∣ble
day has disclosed the secret to me; a
black, a complicated scene of mischief.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning. He
told me he was to dine with a gentleman at
some miles distance, and should not return
till late in the evening.</P>
<P>He was but just gone, when a lady of my
acquaintance called in upon me, to request I
would go with her to a play, that was to
be performed at night. You must know we
have had a company of players in the neigh∣bourhood
for some time past, and it was to
one of those poor people's benefits that she
desired my company. I promised to attend
her, tho' you know I don't much admire
those sort of entertainments in the country,
and seldom go to them.</P>
<P>The lady and her husband called upon me
at the appointed hour, and I went with them
in their coach. The place which the players
had fitted up for their purpose, had formerly
been a pretty large school room, and could,
with the addition of a gallery (which they
had made) with ease contain above three
hundred people. The play had been bespoke
by some of the principal ladies in the neigh∣bourhood,
who had used all their interest for
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
the performer, so that the house was as full
as it could hold. The audience consisting
chiefly of fashionable people, it was with dif∣ficulty
that we reached the places which were
kept for us in the pit, as they happened to
be on the bench next the stage, and the door
was at the other end of the house. The first
object that I observed on my coming in, was
Mr. Faulkland; he bowed to me at a distance,
but made no attempts to approach me. The
play was come to the latter end of the fourth
act, and the curtain was let down to make
some preparation on the stage, when we
were alarmed with the cry of fire.</P>
<P>It happened that the carpenters, who had
been employed in fitting up this extempore
theatre, had left a heap of shavings in a little
place behind the stage, which had been con∣verted
into a dressing-room; a little boy be∣longing
to the company had found a candle
in it, and having piled up the shavings, set
them on fire, and left them burning: the
flame communicated itself to some dry boards
which lay in the room, and in a few minutes
the whole was in a blaze. Some persons,
who heard the crackling of wood, opened
the door, when the flame burst out with such
violence, and the scenes were presently on
fire, and the curtain, which as I told you was
dropt, soon caught it.</P>
<P>The consternation and terror of the poor
people, whose <HI>all</HI> was destroying, is not to
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
be described: the women shrieking, threw
themselves off the stage into the pit, as the
smoke and flames terrified them from at∣tempting
to get out any other way, though
there was a door behind the stage.</P>
<P>The audience were in little less confusion
than they; for as the house was composed
chiefly of wood, every one expected it would
soon be consumed to ashes.</P>
<P>The horror and distraction of my mind
almost deprived me of the power of mo∣tion.
My life was in imminent danger;
for I was scorched with the fire before I
could get at any distance from the stage, tho'
the people were rushing out as fast as they
could.</P>
<P>The lady who was with me was exceeding∣ly
frightned; but being under her husband's
care, had a little more courage than I had.
He caught her round the waist, and lifted her
over the benches, which were very high,
giving me what assistance he could with his
other hand. But the terror and hurry I was in
occasioned my foot to slip, and I fell be∣tween
two of the benches, and sprained my
ancle.</P>
<P>Some people pushing to get out, rushed
between me and my company; the excessive
pain I felt, joined to my fright, made me
faint away; in this condition Mr. Faulkland
sound me, and carried me out in his arms;
for my companion was too anxious for her
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
own safety, to suffer her husband to stay to
give me any assistance, so that he had only
time to beg of the men about him not to let
me perish.</P>
<P>I soon recovered, upon being carried into
the open air, and found myself seated on some
planks, at a little distance from the booth,
Mr. Faulkland supporting me, and two or
three other people about me, whom he had
called to my assistance.</P>
<P>Indebted to him as I was for saving my life,
my spirits were at that time too much agi∣tated
to thank him as I ought.</P>
<P>He told me he had stepped behind the
scenes to speak to somebody, and was there
when the stage took fire; that he then ran
to give what assistance he could to the ladies
that were in the house (observe he distinguish∣ed
not <HI>me</HI> in particular), and had just come
in when he saw me meet with the accident,
which had occasioned my fainting away; and
when the gentleman who was with me, was
calling for help, but at the same time getting
out as fast as he could.</P>
<P>I now began to recollect myself; I was
uneasy at Mr. Faulkland's presence; I wished
him away. I beseeched him to return once
more to the booth, to see if every one had
got out safe, for I told him I had seen se∣veral
of my female acquaintance there, for
whom I was alarmed. With the assistance
of the people who were about me, I said I
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
could make a shift to get to the nearest house,
which was not above a hundred yards off,
from whence I should send home for my
chariot, which I had ordered to come to me
after the play. He begged I would give
him leave to see me safe to that house, but I
would not permit him; and he left me in
the care of two women and a man, who had
come to be spectators of the fire.</P>
<P>With the help of these people, I con∣trived
to hobble (for my ancle pained me
exceedingly) to the place I mentioned, which
happened to be a public house. All the
rooms below were full, and the woman of
the house very obligingly helped me up
stairs to her own chamber. I called for a glass
of water, which was immediately brought
me, and I desired the woman to send some
one to my house, which was at about a mile's
distance, to order my chariot to come to me
immediately.</P>
<P>While the woman went to execute my in∣structions,
I had thrown myself into a chair
that stood close to the wainscot. I heard a
bell ring, and presently a waiter entered, and
asked if I wanted any thing; I told him,
no. He ran hastily out of the room, and
entering the next to that where I was sitting,
I heard a voice, which I knew to be Mr. Ar∣nold's,
ask, Were the servants found? The
man replying that they were not, Then, said
Mr. Arnold, tell your mistress she will o∣blige
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
me if she will let me have her chaise
to carry this lady home. The waiter pre∣sently
withdrew, and without reflecting on
the particularity of Mr. Arnold's being there
with a lady, about whom I formed no con∣jectures,
I was about to rise off my chair to
go in to him; but being almost disabled
from walking, I was obliged to creep along,
holding by the wainscot; when a tender ex∣clamation
of Mr. Arnold's stopped me.
My dearest creature, said he to his compani∣on,
you have not yet recovered your fright.
A female voice answered him with some fond
expressions, which I could not hear distinctly
enough to discover whose it was; but I was
soon put out of doubt, when the lady added,
in a louder tone, Do you know that your
wife was at the play to-night? Mr. Arnold
answered, No; I hope she did not see me.
Mrs. Gerrarde, for I perceived it was she
who spoke, replied, I hope not, because
perhaps she might expect you home after
the play. Though Mr. Arnold, in his first
emotion of suprrize at hearing that I was
at the play, was only anxious lest I should
have observed him, yet he was not so lost
to humanity as to be indifferent whether I
escaped the flames or not: I am surprized I
did not see her, said he; I wish she may
have got out of the house safe. You are
very sollicitous about her, replied Mrs.
Gerrarde, peevishly; there was one there
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
perhaps as anxious for her preservation as
you are—The conversation I found here
was likely to become extremely critical for
me; but I was prevented from hearing any
more, by the woman of the house, who
just then entered the room to ask me
how I did, and to know if I wanted any
thing.</P>
<P>I had heard enough to convince me that
my presence would be very unacceptable
both to Mr. Arnold and his companion,
and I resolved not to interrupt them; nor,
if possible, ever let Mr. Arnold know that
I had made a discovery so fatal to my own
peace, and so disadvantageous to him and
his friend.</P>
<P>The messenger who had been dispatched
for my chariot met it by the way, and was
now returned with it; I was told that it
was at the door; and it was with difficulty
I got down stairs, leaning on the woman of
the house.</P>
<P>I found Mr. Faulkland at the door; he
saw that I wished to disengage myself from
him after he had carried me out of the
booth; and though probably he did not take
the trouble to execute the sham commission
I gave him, which was indeed with no other
view than to get him away, yet I believe
he had too much respect to intrude on me;
and came then with no other design than to
enquire if my chariot had come for me,
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
and how I was after the terrible condition
he had left me in, sitting at night in the
open air, with nobody but two or three
ordinary people about me, and those stran∣gers.
This was a piece of civility which
humanity, had politeness been out of the
question, would have obliged him to. He
told me the fire was extinguished, and hap∣pily
nobody had received any hurt; and
that he had only called at that house to know
if I were safe, and recovered from the fright
and pain he had left me in. I thanked him,
and was just stepping, assisted by Mr. Faulk∣land,
into the chariot, when Mr. Arnold
appeared at the door: he was alone; and I
concluded, that having heard the chariot rat∣tle
up the court-yard, he supposed it was the
carriage he had ordered for Mrs. Gerrarde,
and came down to see if it was ready to re∣ceive
her.</P>
<P>The light which the servant, who attend∣ed
me out, held in his hand, immediately
discovered Mr. Arnold and me to each other.
I could easily distinguish surprize mixed with
displeasure in his countenance. He asked
me abruptly, How I came to that place?
Which I told him, in few words. The cold
civility of a grave bow passed between him
and Mr. Faulkland, who leaving me in my
husband's hands, wished me a good night,
and got into my lord V—'s coach, which
waited for him.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237"/>
Though I knew, from the discourse I had
overheard, that Mr. Arnold did not mean to
go home with me, yet as I was now seated
in the chariot, I could not avoid asking him.
He told me, he was engaged to sup with
company at that house, and that probably he
should not be at home till late. I knew this
beforehand, and, without troubling him
with any farther questions, drove home.</P>
<P>I have thrown together the strange occur∣rences
of this evening, as well as the tu∣mult
of my spirits would give me leave:
I shall now lay down my pen, to consider of
them a little more calmly. My heart sinks
in me—Oh! that I had remained in igno∣rance!—</P>
<P>Is it possible, my Cecilia, that Mr. Ar∣nold,
so good a man, one who married me
too for love, and who for these two years
has been the tenderest, the kindest husband,
and to whom I never gave the most distant
shadow of offence, should at last be led
into—I cannot name it—dare not think
of it—yet a hundred circumstances recur
to my memory, which now convince me I
am unhappy! If I had not been blind, I
might have seen it sooner. I recollect some
passages, which satisfy me that Mr. Arnold's
acquaintance with Mrs. Gerrarde did not
commence at South-park. I remember lady
V—once asked me, had she and I
been acquainted in London? I said, No.
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
My lord laughed, and in his blunt way said,
I will swear your husband was, for I have
seen him hand her out from the play more
than once. I never asked Mr. Arnold about
this; it made no impression on me at the
time it was spoke, and went quick out of my
thoughts.</P>
<P>'Tis one o'clock: I hear Mr. Arnold ring
at the outer gate; I tremble all over, and
feel as if I feared to see him. Yet why should
I fear? <HI>I</HI> have not injured <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 2.—Mr. Arnold staid long
enough in his dressing-room after he came in
last night, to give me time to go to-bed be∣fore
he came up stairs. Not a word passed
between us: I slept not the whole night:
whether he did or not I cannot tell. He
asked me this morning, when he rose, how
I did: I told him in great pain. My ancle
was prodigiously swelled, and turned quite
black, for I had neglected it last night. He
said, you had better let a surgeon see it, and
went carelessly out of the room. How new
is unkindness to me, my friend! you know
I have not been used to it. Mr. Arnold adds
cruelty too—but let it be so; far be
reproaches or complaints from my lips; to
you only, my second self, shall I utter them;
to you I am bound by solemn promise, and
reciprocal confidence, to disclose the inmost
secrets of my soul, and with you they are as
safe as in my own breast.—</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="239"/>
I am once more composed, and deter∣mined
on my behaviour. I have not a doubt
remaining of Mr. Arnold's infidelity; but
let me not aggravate my own griefs, nor
to a vicious world justify my husband's con∣duct,
by bringing any reproach on my
own. The silent sufferings of the injured,
must, to a mind not ungenerous, be a shar∣per
rebuke than it is in the power of language
to inflict.</P>
<P>But this is not all: I must endeavour, if
possible, to skreen Mr. Arnold from censure.
I hope his own imprudence may not render
these endeavours ineffectual. I am resolved
not to drop my acquaintance with Mrs. Ger∣rarde.
While we continue upon a footing
of seeming intimacy, the frequent visits,
which I am sure Mr. Arnold makes at her
house, will be less taken notice of.</P>
<P>How Sir George would triumph at the
knowledge of Mr. Arnold's deviating from
virtue! How my poor mother would be
amazed and afflicted! But I will, as far as
lies in my power, disappoint the malice of
my stars; my mother shall have no cause to
grieve, nor my brother to rejoice; the secret
shall die with me in my own bosom, and I
will wait patiently, 'till the hand of time ap∣plies
a remedy to my grief.—Mrs. Ger∣rarde
sent a message to enquire how I did.
Conscious woman! she would not come her∣self,
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
though she knew not I had discovered
her.</P>
<P>My dear good lady V—hurried to
see me the instant she had breakfasted: Mr.
Faulkland had told her of my disaster,
and her tenderness soothed and comforted
me much. She sat by my bed-side two
hours, and her discourse alleviated the pain
both of my mind and body; but now she
has left me, I must again recur to the sub∣ject
that wrings my heart. Mr. Arnold is
enslaved to one of the most artful of her
sex. I look upon his attachment to be
the more dangerous, as I believe it is the
first of the kind he ever had; and no wo∣man
was ever more formed to please and to
deceive, than she who now holds him in her
chains. Into what hands am I fallen! Mrs.
Gerrarde must have heard my story, and
by the hint I heard her drop, what cruel
misrepresentations may she have made to Mr.
Arnold! Mr. Faulkland, she can have no
enmity to; but me she certainly hates, for she
has injured me.</P>
<P>'Tis noon: I have not seen Mr. Arnold
since morning; he has been abroad ever since
he rose; Good God! is this the life I am
condemned to lead?</P>
<P>A new scene of affliction is opened to me:
surely my fate is drawing towards a crisis.
Mr. Arnold has just left me. What a con∣versation
have we had!</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241"/>
After entering my room, he walked about
for some minutes without speaking; at last
stopping short, and fixing his eyes upon me,
How long have you, said he, been acquaint∣ed
with Mr. Faulkland? I told him my ac∣quaintance
began with him some months be∣fore
I was married. He was once your lo∣ver,
I am informed. He was, and a treaty
of marriage was concluded on between us.
You would have been happier perhaps, ma∣dam,
if it had taken place. I do not think
so, Mr. Arnold, you have no reason to sup∣pose
I do. I had a very great objection to
Mr. Faulkland, and obeyed my mother
willingly, when she forbid me to see him.
I ask not what that objection was, said he;
but I suppose, madam, you will without
reluctance obey <HI>me,</HI> if I make the same re∣quest
to you. Most chearfully; you cannot
make a request with which I should more
readily comply. But let me beseech you,
Mr. Arnold, to tell me, what part of my
behaviour has given you cause to think such
a prohibition necessary? I do not say, an∣swered
Mr. Arnold, that I have any suspicion
of your virtue; but your acquiescence in
this particular is necessary to <HI>my</HI> peace and
your <HI>own</HI> honour. A lady's being <HI>married</HI>
does not cut off the hopes of a gay man.
You give me your promise that you will not
see him any more. I <HI>do,</HI> said I; I will give
up lady V—, whose acquaintance I so much
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
esteem: I will go no more to the house while
Mr. Faulkland continues there; and I know
of no other family, where I visit, that he
is acquainted with.</P>
<P>My pride would not suffer me to enquire
where he had got his information: I already
knew it too well; and fearing he would
rather descend to an untruth than tell me his
author, I declined any farther questions.
He seemed satisfied with my promise, but
quickly left me, as if the whole end of his
visit to me was accomplished in having ob∣tained
it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 8.—What painful minutes
am I obliged to sustain! Mrs. Gerrarde has
been to see me, gay and assured as ever.
She affected to condole with me on the ac∣cident
that had happened to my foot, with
such an overstrained concern, such a tender
solicitude, that her insincerity disgusted me,
if possible, more than the other part of her
behaviour. She told me, she herself had
been at the play, but very luckily had got
out without receiving any injury. I said, I
was surprized I had not seen her there. O,
replied she, I was in a little snug corner,
where nobody could see me; for having
refused to go with some ladies that asked
me, I did not chuse to be visible in the
house, and so squeezed myself up into what
they called their gallery, for I took nobody
with me but my maid. Audacious woman!
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
—Is it not strange, my dear, that Mr.
Arnold could be so weak as to humour her
in the absurd frolick of going with her to
such a place; for so it must have been; or
perhaps she appointed him only to call for
her at the play; and he might have arrived
but just in time to assist her in getting out.
No matter which it was.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 9.—I was born to sacrifice my
own peace to that of other people; my life
is become miserable, but I have no remedy
for it but patience.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold spends whole days abroad; at
night we are separated on account of my in∣disposition;
so that we hardly ever converse
together. What a dreadful prospect have I
before me! O! Cecilia, may you never ex∣perience
the bitterness of having your hus∣band's
heart alienated from you!</P>
<P>Lady V—, that best of creatures, is
with me constantly; she presses me to come
to her house, as my ancle is now pretty
well, yet I am obliged to excuse myself. I
am distressed to the last degree at the conduct
I shall be forced to observe towards her,
yet dare not explain the motive. Causeless
jealousy is always the subject of ridicule, and
at all events Mr. Arnold must not be exposed
to this.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 12.—I am weary of invent∣ing
excuses for absenting myself from
V—hall. My lady has done solliciting
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
me, yet continues her friendly and affection∣ate
visits; I fear she guesses my situation,
though she has not as yet hinted at it; but
her forbearing to press me any more on the
subject of going to her, and at the same
time not requiring a reason for this breach of
civility as well as friendship, convinces me,
that she suspects the cause of my restraint.
I am now perfectly recovered, yet do I still
confine myself to my house, to avoid as
much as possible giving umbrage to lady
V—: but this restraint cannot last much
longer; Mrs. Gerrarde teazes me to come to
her, and I have promised to make her my
first visit.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 27.—Said I not that my fate
was near its crisis? Where will this impend∣ing
ruin end? Take, my Cecilia, the occur∣rences
of this frightful day.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning, and
told me he should not return 'till night.
He asked me, with that indifference which
now accompanies all his words, How I
meant to dispose of myself for the day? I
told him I had no design of going abroad,
and should spend my time in reading, or at
my needle. This was my real intention;
but Mr. Arnold had but just left the house,
when I received a message from Mrs. Gerrarde
to know how I did, and to tell me she was
not well, and much out of spirits, or she
would come and pass the day with me; but
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
that she insisted on my dining with her. As
I had told Mr. Arnold I did not mean to go
out, I really had neither intention nor incli∣nation
to do so. But shall I confess my weak∣ness
to you? I suspected that he purposed
spending the day (as he often did) with Mrs.
Gerrarde, and the more so from the question
he had asked me on his going abroad; he
thought I might probably pay her a visit; and
this intrusion was a circumstance he had a
mind to be guarded against, by knowing be∣forehand
my designs, I had not been to see
Mrs. Gerrarde since my recovery, and it was
natural to suppose I would return her visits.
Possessed as I was with this opinion, her
message gave me a secret satisfaction, as it
served to convince me Mr. Arnold was not
to be with her, for she generally detained me
late when I went to her house. From what
trivial circumstances will the afflicted draw
consolation, or an additional weight of grief?
So it was, I felt a sort of pleasure, in think∣ing,
that for all that day at least Mr. Arnold
would absent himself from my rival.—My
rival! mean word, she is not worthy to be
called so; from his mistress let it be. In
short, I resolved to go, especially as she had
sent me word she was not well, and I knew
my husband would be pleased with my com∣plaisance.</P>
<P>I went accordingly to her house, a little
before her hour of dining, which is much
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
later than any body's else in this part of the
world. I found her dressed out, and seem∣ingly
in perfect health. She looked sur∣prized
when she saw me; and I then sup∣posed
that she hoped to have received a de∣nial
from me, and was disappointed at my
coming; though I wondered that the answer
she received to her message had not prepared
her. This thought rushed into my mind in
an instant, and I was sure she expected Mr.
Arnold. I told her if I had thought I should
have found her so well, that her message
should not have brought me to her; for that
I had determined not to stir out that day,
'till her invitation prevailed on me to change
my mind. Sure, my dear, said she, there
must have been some mistake in delivering
the message to you, it was for to-morrow I
desired the pleasure of your company to dine
with me; for to-day I am absolutely en∣gaged.
However, I am very glad you are
come, for I shall not go out 'till seven
o'clock. I was vexed and mortified; either
your servant or mine made a mistake, said
I, for I was told you desired to see me today; besides you sent me word you were
not well. She seemed a little abashed at
this: I <HI>was</HI> very ill in the morning, she said;
and though I was engaged to spend the
evening abroad, did intend to have sent an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cuse; but finding myself better, I changed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247"/>
Dinner was immediately served, and I
sat down, but with a reluctance that pre∣vented
me from eating. I would have taken
my leave soon after dinner, but Mrs. Gerrarde
insisted on my staying, and told me, if I re∣fused
her, she should think I had taken some∣thing
amiss of her. She called for cards; I
suffered myself to be persuaded, and we fell
to piquet.</P>
<P>I played with disgust, and without atten∣tion,
every minute wishing to break away.
Coffee was at length brought in; I begged
to be excused from staying, telling Mrs.
Gerrarde, I was sure I prevented her from
going abroad, but she would take no denial.
I was constrained to take a dish of coffee,
and was hastening to get it down when the
parlour door flew open, and lo! Mr. Faulk∣land
entered the room. If an object the
most horrible to human nature had appeared
before me, it could not, at that instant, have
shocked me half so much. I let the cup and
saucer drop from my hand: to say I turned
pale, trembled, and was ready to faint, would
be too feeble a description of the effect this
spectre had on me. I was senseless, I almost
died away. Mrs. Gerrarde pretended to be
greatly alarmed; she ran for drops, and
having given me a few in a glass of water,
I made a shift to rise off my chair, and
telling her, I should be glad of a little air,
tottered to the street-door. I determined to
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
go home directly, but the universal tremor I
was now in, disabled me from walking, and
I sat down in the porch to recover myself a
little. Mr. Faulkland's having been a wit∣ness
to the agony his presence had thrown me
into, did not a little aggravate the horror
and confusion of my thoughts. Whatever
<HI>his</HI> were, he had not spoke to me, nor was
it possible for me to have remarked his beha∣viour:
I staid not more than two minutes
in the parlour after he entered. In this situ∣ation
you will think my distress would hard∣ly
admit of any addition; but the final
blow was yet to come. Mrs. Gerrarde had
staid a minute in the parlour to speak to Mr.
Faulkland after I went out, but presently
followed me, and was soothing me with
the kindest expressions, when I heard the
trampling of horses, and presently beheld
Mr. Arnold alighting at the door. I now
gave myself up for lost. My mind suddenly
suggested to me that Mrs. Gerrarde had con∣trived
a plot upon my innocence; but how
she had been able to bring it about, my
thoughts were not then disengaged enough
to conceive. My mind was all a chaos; I
was not able to answer Mr. Arnold when he
spoke to me. He soon perceived my disor∣der,
and enquired the cause. Mrs. Gerrarde
took upon her to answer, that I was just
preparing to go home, when I was taken
suddenly ill. I was going abroad, said she,
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
and as I ordered the chariot much about this
hour, I fancy it is ready, and may as well
carry Mrs. Arnold home; you had best step
into the parlour, my dear, (to me) 'till it is
brought to the door.</P>
<P>I am now able to walk, madam, said I;
there is no occasion to give you that trouble.
Mr. Arnold said, I should not walk by any
means; and Mrs. Gerrarde immediately
calling to a servant to order the chariot to
the door, said, as she was going out, she
would leave me at home herself. Mr. Ar∣nold
answered, it would be the best way,
and that he should follow soon. The cha∣riot
was presently at the door, and I was pre∣paring
to get into it, when Mrs. Gerrarde
cry'd, Bless me, I had forgot, it will not be
so civil to leave the gentleman behind, with∣out
saying any thing to him. Mr. Arnold
hastily asked, What Gentleman? Mrs. Ger∣rarde
replied, Mr. Faulkland, <HI>who took it
into his head</HI> to make me a visit this evening.
She went quickly into the parlour, and strait
returned with Mr. Faulkland; who bowing
carelesly to Mr. Arnold, and civilly to me,
walked away.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde stepped into the chariot to
me, and ordered it to drive to my house,
leaving Mr. Arnold standing motionless at
her door.</P>
<P>A total silence prevailed on my side dure∣ing
our short journey home, except to an∣swer
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
in monosyllables Mrs. Gerrarde's re∣peated
enquiries after my health. She set
me down at my door, and took her leave
without alighting. When I found myself
alone, I began to consider the consequences
of this evening's fatal interview; an inter∣view,
which, though unthought of by me,
I judged was contrived to ensnare me. I
laid all the circumstances together, and en∣deavoured
to unravel the clue. 'Tis plain to
me Mr. Arnold was expected by Mrs. Ger∣rarde
this evening. She sent for me on
purpose to betray me; the message, which
she pretended was delivered wrong, was
only an artifice, in order to impose on Mr.
Arnold, that he might imagine she did not
expect me. Indeed, he could not possibly
think she should send for me on the very
evening he was to be with her; and she
had so well guarded her contrivance, that it
was not easily to be detected. She had sent
her message by word of mouth, though she
generally wrote them down on paper, but
this way would not have been liable to mis∣construction:
she had told me she was en∣gaged
in the evening, yet detained me
longer than I meant to stay. From the first
of these circumstances, it must appear to
Mr. Arnold, that as I had come unwished∣for,
she wanted to get rid of me; the lat∣ter
obviously served her own purpose; for it
is as clear as daylight, that she laid her plan
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
so as that Mr. Arnold should find Mr.
Faulkland and me together. All this I have
deduced from a long train of reasoning on
the circumstances. But the inexplicable part
of the mystery is how she contrived to get
Mr. Faulkland, with whom I did not think
she was acquainted, to visit her at so fatally
critical a juncture. Sure some evil spirit
must have assisted her in this wicked scheme:
she knew, no doubt, of the promise Mr.
Arnold had exacted of me, never to see
him. The apparent breach of this promise,
she may have art enough to persuade Mr.
Arnold was concerted on my side. But I
hope I shall be able to clear myself of this
cruel imputation to my husband. Truth
<HI>must</HI> force its way into his mind, if he is
not resolved on my destruction. Perhaps
Mr. Faulkland may be secretly Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
admirer, and Mr. Arnold is the dupe
to her perfidy, as I am the sacrifice to her
malice and licentiousness.—'Tis all a
strange riddle, but I cannot remain long in
this dismal state of suspence; Mr. Arnold,
perhaps, may discover her treachery, while
she is endeavouring to destroy me in his good
opinion.</P>
<P>I am waiting here like a poor criminal, in
expectation of appearing before my judge. I
wish Mr. Arnold were come in, yet I dread
to see him.</P>
<P>I might have spared myself the anxiety.
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
Mr. Arnold is just returned, but he has
locked himself into another chamber. I
will not molest him to night; to-morrow,
perhaps, he may be in better temper, and
I may be able to justify myself to him,
and dispel this frightful gloom that hangs
over us.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 13.—Hopes and fears are at
an end, and the measure of my afflictions is
filled up.</P>
<P>I went to bed last night, but slept not;
the hours were passed in agonies not to be
described. I think all griefs are magnified
by silence and darkness. I well knew, pre∣possessed
as Mr. Arnold was by my artful
enemy, I should find it difficult to excuse
myself, or persuade him, that chance, or
Mrs. Gerrarde's more wicked contrivance,
had been the sole cause of what had given
him such offence. I was resolved, however,
to vindicate my innocence, and was, in my
own thoughts, preparing my defence the
greatest part of the night. Towards morn∣ing,
weariness and grief overpowered me,
and I fell asleep, but I enjoyed not this re∣pose
long. Some noise that was made in
the house suddenly awakened me; I saw it
was broad day, and looking at my watch,
found it was past seven o'clock. I rang my
bell, and Patty entering my room, I en∣quired
if her master was yet stirring. The
poor girl looked aghast, He is gone away on
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
horseback, madam, said she, almost two
hours ago; and he ordered his man to put
up some linen and a few other things in a
small portmanteau. I believe he means not
to return to-night; for he bid me to deliver
this letter to you. I opened the letter with
trembling hands, from whence I received my
doom in the following words:</P>
<P>“You have broke your faith with me, in
seeing the man whom I forbad you to see,
and whom you so solemnly promised to a∣void.
As you have betrayed my confidence
in this particular, I can no longer rely on
your prudence, or your fidelity. Whatever
your designs may be, it will be less to my
dishonour if you prosecute them from under
your husband's roof. I therefore give you
'till this day se'nnight to consider of a place
for your future abode; for one house must
no more contain two people, whose hearts
are divided. Our children remain with me,
and the settlement which was made on you
in marriage, shall be appropriated to your
separate use.</P>
<P>“I have left home to avoid expostulati∣ons,
nor shall I return to it 'till I hear you
have removed yourself. Spare the attempt
of a justification, which can only aggravate
the resentment of your already too-much in∣jured
husband.”</P>
<P>I have for a while suppressed the tu∣mult
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
in my soul, to give you this shocking
letter.</P>
<P>O my Cecilia! What a wretched lot is
thy unhappy friend's! To be neglected, for∣saken,
despised, by a husband that I love!
Yet I could bear that: but to be suspected,
accused too! to be at once the miserable ob∣ject
of jealousy and scorn! Surely they know
nothing of the human heart, who say that
jealousy cannot subsist without affection; I
have a fatal proof to the contrary. Mr. Ar∣nold
loves me not, yet doubts my honour.
Cruel, mean, detestable suspicion! Oh that
vile woman! 'tis she has done this; like a
persecuting daemon she urges on the ruin
which she set on foot.</P>
<P>What can I do? Whither can I fly? I
cannot remain here any longer; my pre∣sence
banishes Mr. Arnold from his home.
If I go to my mother under such circum∣stances,
it will break her heart; yet she must
know it. I must not wait to be turned out
of my own doors. That thought is not to
be borne. I will go this instant, no matter
whither.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.—God preserve me in
my senses! I have passed two days and two
nights I know not how; in silence and with∣out
food, Patty tells me. But I think I am
a little recovered. I will write to my mo∣ther,
and beg of her to open her arms to
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
receive her miserable child. I am collected
enough, and know what to say.</P>
<P>I had just dispatched my letter, incohe∣rent
as it is, and blotted with my tears, when
Patty brought me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that had come by the
post. I knew my dear mother's hand on
the superscription, and kissed it before I
opened it. See, my sister, how the tender∣est
of parents writes to her unhappy child,
whom she fondly believes to be the darling
of her husband, and blessed with domestic
felicity.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My beloved Sidney,</OPENER>
<P>I find age and infirmities are advancing
a-pace upon me. My last illness shook me
severely, and has left a memorandum of
what I may expect in the next visit it makes
me. Your family cares are now so much
enlarged, that I cannot expect, nor do I de∣sire
that you should undertake a journey to
Sidney-castle to pay me a short visit; yet,
my dear, as you are the comfort of my age,
I cannot, in the present precarious state of
my health, bear to be at such a distance
from you; while God permits me strength
I will lay hold of his bounty, and endeavour
to get to London. You have told me that
you are not conveniently circumstanced at
South-park as to room; I will not theresore
incommode you, but shall content myself
with waiting your arrival in town, at your
house in St. James's-street; but do not
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
hasten your departure from the country on
this account. I am in no immediate danger,
my dear, only willing to lay hold of an in∣terval
of health, to get nearer to you. If
God prolongs my life, what joy will it be to
me to spend next winter with my darling, and
her dear good Arnold, and to feast my eyes
with my lovely grandchildren!</P>
<P>If I am called from you, I shall have the
comfort of my child's affectionate hands to
close my eyes; and shall leave the world
without regret, as I have lived to see my
Sidney happy in the arms of a good man,
who will supply the loss of parents, and unite
in himself those tender ties which nature must
soon dissolve.</P>
<P>My prayers for yours, and my dear son's
prosperity, I never fail to offer up to Heaven.
Your brother George is with me, and desires
to be remembered to you; he purposes stay∣ing
here the greatest part of the winter.</P>
<P>As I hope to reach London by the latter
end of the week, direct your next to me at
your own house in town.</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
My dear love,
Your most sincerely
affectionate mother,
<SIGNED>DOROTHY BIDULPH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>My heart is bursting—O. Cecilia!
What will become of my fond, my dear
venerable parent, when she finds this daugh∣ter,
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
this comfort of her age, this beloved of
her soul, a poor abandoned outcast; lost
to her husband's love, turned out of his
doors, despised, disgraced! My children
too—I must leave them behind—
My God, for what calamities hast thou or∣dained
thy creature! Tears, tears, you may
well flow!</P>
<P>So! I am relieved, and will endeavour
to fortify my soul against the two events,
that appear to me horrid as an approaching
execution to a guilty wretch, the parting
with my children, and the meeting with
my mother. As the letter I wrote will miss
of her at Sidney-castle, I shall write to
London, to prepare her to receive the wretch
whom her imagination has figured to her so
happy.</P>
<P>Lady V—! I hear her coming up stairs
—I cannot conceal my affliction, nor my
disgrace.</P>
<P>Lady V—has left me: left me in a∣stonishment
and new horror. Mrs. Ger∣rarde!
Who do you think Mrs. Gerrarde
is? She is the aunt of Miss Burchell, that
aunt who betrayed her to destruction. Sure
this woman was sent into the world for a
scourge!</P>
<P>I cannot collect myself to tell you with
any method, the conversation that passed
between lady V—and me. She found
me with the marks of tears on my face;
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
they streamed again at the sight of her; I
could not conceal the cause, and I put Mr.
Arnold's letter into her hands, for I was not
able to tell her the purport of it.</P>
<P>This is Mrs. Gerrarde's doing, said she,
the detestable creature! How could she
work on your infatuated husband, to drive
him such horrid lengths? I know not, said
I, but I hope my lady V—believes me
innocent. Innocent, she exclaimed! My
dear creature, your sufferings almost make
me mad. Do you know that Mrs. Ger∣rarde
has an intrigue with your husband?
I fear so, madam, I replied, but I hoped it
was not publick. Poor child, said lady
V—, his attachment to her has been
no secret, ever since he came down to this
country, though probably you were the last
to suspect it. I have often dreaded the con∣sequences
of it, but never imagined it would
have come to this; I always had a bad opi∣nion
of the woman, and only kept up a face
of civility to her in her husband's time, on
account of her niece, a charming girl that
then lived with her; but since Miss Burchell
has left her, I have almost dropt my acquaint∣ance
with her; though my lord, who had an
old friendship for captain Gerrarde, persuades
me to be civil to her.</P>
<P>The name of miss Burchell had struck me
speechless. The clue was now unravelled.
With what an unremitting zeal has this base
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
woman gone on in her career of iniquity?
Lady V—, who was intirely taken up with
the thoughts of my unhappiness, took no
notice of my silence or confusion. What
do you mean to do, my dear Mrs. Arnold,
said she? Do you think it is not possible,
by the interposition of friends, to disabuse
your unfortunate husband? For unfortunate
he is, in a higher degree than yourself, as
you have conscious innocence to support you.
Oh madam, said I, it is in vain to think of
it! Mrs. Gerrarde has struck the blow ef∣fectually.
Were Mr. Arnold left to the
workings of his own heart, he might, per∣haps,
relent; but that woman, like my
evil genius and his, will take care to keep his
suspicions alive. She possesses his whole
heart, and my removal is become necessary,
to the quiet of them both. I have taken my
resolution, I will immediately quit this house,
and leave it to a righteous God to vindi∣cate
me in his own time. You should go
no where but to my house, said lady V—,
with tears in her eyes, but that I think it
an improper situation for you, while Mr.
Faulkland is my guest. He will be distract∣ed
when he hears of this. I conjured lady
V—not to tell him: My being parted
from my husband cannot long be a secret,
said I, but the cause may. Lady V—
told me that Mr. Faulkland had that very
morning set out for Sidney-castle, to see my
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
brother; having received a letter from him
the day before, in which he told him that
my mother was going in a day or two to
London, and begged he would come and
spend a week with him. She added, Mr.
Faulkland purposed doing so, and then to
return to V—hall, as my lord had ob∣tained
a promise from him to stay some
time longer with them; at least 'till the old
lady's affairs were settled, who had left her
fortune to Mr. Faulkland, and to whom my
Lord V—was executor.</P>
<P>I told lady V—I depended on her friend∣ship,
to keep this affair a secret from Mr.
Faulkland, lest the heat of his temper
should make him take such notice of it, as
might render my separation from Mr. Ar∣nold
doubly injurious to my character. La∣dy
V—saw the necessity of this caution,
and promised to observe it. She expressed
great surprize at Mr. Faulkland's visiting
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom she said, she did not
imagine he had been acquainted with. He
is no stranger, said she, to your husband's
amour with her, as it has often been a topic
of discourse between my lord and me; and
I can hardly think he would be so indelicate
as to carry on a love-affair with such an a∣bandoned
creature; especially as I have often
heard him express the utmost detestation of
her, on account of her robbing you of your
husband's affection; which I had observed
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
for a good while. But there is no knowing
mankind, added she: if that should be the
case, you may depend upon it that vile Ger∣rarde
has laid her plan deeper than we are
aware of, and would out-swear us all, that
Faulkland came to her house for no other
purpose, than to have an opportunity of see∣ing
you; who to be sure, she said, had
given him a private hint to meet you there.
Now the worst of it is, it is impossible to
have this matter cleared up to your husband,
without Mr. Faulkland's concurrence, and
that you will not consent to. By no means,
I replied, I would not for the world have
Mr. Faulkland interfere in my justification.
If the affair should really be as you have
suggested, a little time may, perhaps, dis∣cover
this wicked woman to Mr. Arnold,
and it will not then be so difficult to clear my
innocence. At present, her influence over
him is too powerful for me to combat with;
and I know he wishes for nothing more than
to free himself from the restraint that my
presence lays him under.</P>
<P>Lady V—acquiesced in my opinion, and
said, she hoped a little time would chace
away the dark cloud that now hung over
me. She staid with me the whole day; it
was a day of tears: the dear woman was
quite subdued at parting with me. I see
you no more, dear lady V—, said I, I shall
go to London in two days—Preserve
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
your fortitude, dearest Mrs. Arnold, she re∣plied;
the time will come when your hus∣band
will repent of the bitter distress he has
occasioned to you: my lord and I will use
our utmost endeavours to convince him of
his error.—We shall meet in London,
my dear, I shall go thither early in the winter
on purpose—Have courage—Your inno∣cence
<HI>must</HI> be cleared. I answered her not,
my heart was too full. We embraced, and
lady V—parted from me in silence.</P>
<P>I have written to my mother, and directed
my letter to St. James's-street. I would have
her prepared for the shock before she sees
me; a shock, which I fear she will not be
able to sustain.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 16.—Mrs. Gerrarde has never
called or sent to me since I was at her house.
She has effected her purpose, and is content∣ed
without a triumph.</P>
<P>I am prepared for my departure. To∣morrow
I turn my back upon my husband's
house, and upon my children. I have been
weeping over them this hour as they lie
asleep in their nurse's arms. But I will look
at them no more.—Poor Patty is almost
dead with grief; she would fain go with
me, but I have persuaded her to stay: I can
rely on her fidelity and her tenderness to∣wards
my children; she says, she <HI>will</HI> be as
precious of them as the apple of her eye,
and will give me an account of their wel∣fare
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
from time to time. Sure Mr. Arnold
will not turn <HI>her</HI> out too; she is an excellent
manager, and he cannot do without a house∣keeper.</P>
<P>I have been debating with myself whether
I should write to Mr. Arnold or not, and
have at length determined to depart in si∣lence.
It is an easy matter for the guilty to
make as bold asseverations as the innocent,
and nothing which I could now assert would
make an impression on him. Had I only
his suspicions to combat, there might be
hopes: but his <HI>heart</HI> is alienated from me;
and while it continues attached to another,
I despair of his listening to the voice of rea∣son
or of justice. If ever his eyes are open∣ed,
his error will prove sufficient punishment
to him—Perhaps my mother or my brother
may put me in a way—My conduct, in time,
I hope, may justify me—Mean while I will
not condescend to the weak justification of
words.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 18.—I have bid adieu to
South-park, and arrived this morning in
London in a hired carriage, for I would
not take one of Mr. Arnold's. I found my
mother at the house in St. James's-street,
where I now am: she got here last night, and
my letter had thrown her into agonies, from
which she had not yet recovered. What
have you wrote to me, said she, as she held
me in her arms? your dreadful letter has al∣most
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
killed me.—Sure, sure, my dear child,
it cannot be true that you have left your hus∣band!
What is the cause? What have <HI>you</HI>
done? or, What has <HI>he</HI> done? I begged my
mother to compose herself a little, and then
related to her every circumstance, in the same
manner you have had them as they occurred.
Her lamentations pierced my heart; she
wrung her hands in bitterness of anguish;
Why did not the grave hide me, said she,
before I saw shame and sorrow heaped upon
my child. I came to die in peace with you
—You might have lengthened my days for
a while—But you cut them off—My eyes will
close in affliction—A wounded spirit who
can bear! Had you died in your cradle, we
had both been happy. My child would now
have been a cherub! an angel you have been
in my eyes, and I am punished for it; but
that was <HI>my</HI> crime, not your's. But you are
a martyr to the crimes of others.</P>
<P>My mother wept not all this time; I
wished she had; her passionate looks and
tones affected me more than tears could.
My eyes began to run over, her's soon accom∣panied
me, and it a little relieved the vehe∣mence
of her grief.</P>
<P>She then began to reproach herself for
having listened to lady Grimston's suggesti∣ons
in favour of Mr. Arnold, and for her
own solliciting this fatal marriage. But I
stopped her, on a subject which I knew would
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
so much torment her thoughts. I conjured
her not to reflect on it in that manner; I
told her I knew she had acted for the best,
and that nothing but an extraordinary fata∣lity,
which could neither be foreseen nor
avoided, had made me unhappy. I said I
was sure Mr. Arnold had been seduced by
the wiles of a wicked woman, for that he
was by nature a good man, and that he had
more of my pity than of my resentment.</P>
<P>I found it necessary to reconcile my mo∣ther
to herself on this head; she seemed
willing to lay hold on the hint, and turned
all her indignation against Mrs. Gerrarde.
A <HI>practised</HI> sinner, she called her, for whom
nothing could be said in extenuation of her
crime.</P>
<P>We now turned our thoughts towards
fixing on some other abode. You may be
sure Mr. Arnold's house is no place for us;
and my mother declared she would not stay
another night in it: accordingly we have
dispatched her maid to take us lodgings im∣mediately.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 21.—We have quickly shifted
the scene, my dear Cecilia, and are settled,
at least for the present, in very handsome
lodgings in St. Alban's-street. We came to
them last night, and my mother seems a
little less disturbed than she was. I pray
God spare her life, but I fear I shall not long
enjoy that blessing. She is sadly altered
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
since I last saw her; a dropsical complaint is
stealing on her fast, her legs are swelled,
and she has intirely lost her appetite; yet if
her mind were a little more at ease, I should
hope, that by the assistance she can have
here, she might be enabled to hold out a∣gainst
this disorder for a good while. I en∣deavour
to suppress my own grief, that I may
not increase her's.</P>
<P>I was surprized to-day by a visitor to my
mother. Miss Burchell came to pay her re∣spects
to her: I have told you they corres∣ponded.
My mother, it seems, had given
her notice of the time she intended being
in town: the young lady had been to wait
on her in St James's-street, and was from
thence directed by the servant, who kept
the house, to our new lodgings.</P>
<P>She is really a very lovely young woman;
and there is something so insinuating in her
manner, that there is no seeing her without
being prejudiced in her favour. She changed
colour when my mother presented me to
her by my name; but, at the same time,
surveyed me with a scrutinous eye. My
mother asked her, had she seen Mr. Faulk∣land
since his return to England. She an∣swered,
No, with a sigh; but that she be∣lieved
he had been at Putney. To see his
son, said my mother? without reflecting,
that Miss Burchell had avoided mentioning
that circumstance, and stopped upon name∣ing
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
the place where the child was at nurse.
Yes, she replied, in a timorous accent, and
stealing a look at me. The woman told
me, that a young gentleman had been there
about six weeks ago, who said he came
from the child's father abroad, and made
her a handsome present. As I did not then
know Mr. Faulkland was returned to Eng∣land,
I should not have suspected it was he
himself who had called, if his housekeeper
(that gentlewoman in whose care he left me)
had not come to me from him. She is
settled now in a lodging-house; and Mr.
Faulkland, on his coming to London, went
to her, to enquire where the child was.
She told me he enquired civilly after me,
and gave her a letter for me, which the
good-natured woman joyfully brought me;
but it contained nothing but a bill of a hun∣dred
pounds, with two or three lines, po∣lite
indeed, but not kind, to inform me it
was for the child's use; and I have heard
nothing of him since.</P>
<P>My mother told her, that as Mr. Faulk∣land
was returned again, probably to con∣tinue
in England, she did not despair of
his being brought to do her justice: espe∣cially
as she must suppose the sight of the
child had made an impression on him. She
then, without ceremony, entered into a
detail of my unhappy story: she was full of
it; and being, as you know, of a very
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
communicative temper, made no scruple to
inform Miss Burchell of every particular.
She seemed very much affected with the
story, and grew red and pale by turns; es∣pecially
at finding her aunt so deeply con∣cerned
in it. She exclaimed against her
barbarity, reproached Mr. Arnold for his
injurious suspicions, and condoled obliging∣ly
with me on the wrongs I had received;
and yet, my Cecilia, would you believe it,
I thought I could discover, through all
this, that Miss Burchell was not entirely free
from doubt in regard to my innocence.
This observation I gathered only from cer∣tain
looks that she cast at me, as my mo∣ther
related the passages. There are little
minute touches on the countenance some∣times,
which are so transient they can hardly
be overtaken by the eye, and which, from
the passions being strongly guarded that
give rise to these emotions, are so slight,
that a common observer cannot discover
them at all. I am sure my mother did not;
but my sensibility was particularly rouzed at
her relating a story that I did not then wish
to have divulged; and I was too much in∣terested
in the narrative, not to attend pre∣cisely
to its effects on the hearer. I am
neither angry with, nor surprized at Miss
Burchell, for her scepticism on this occasion.
She loves Mr. Faulkland, and had not
herself the power to resist him: she knows
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
he once loved me, and may fancy he does so
still; nay, thinks perhaps I am not indiffer∣ent
towards him: she is a stranger to <HI>my</HI>
heart; but is convinced, that her aunt is
base enough, first to ensnare to vice, and
then to betray. Upon the whole, there is
nothing unnatural in her suspicions; but I
think they could not proceed from a vir∣tuous
mind.</P>
<P>Upon Miss Burchell's taking leave, my
mother gave her a general invitation to
come to her as often as she had leisure;
telling her, she must not take it amiss if
she did not return her visits, as her health
would not permit her to go much abroad.</P>
<P>Miss Burchell, it seems, has a house (not
lodgings) in a retired street in Westminster,
where she has been ever since she quitted
her aunt, to whom she never discovered
where she lived. Her fortune enables her
to appear very genteelly in the private man∣ner
she chuses to live. She goes but sel∣dom
into publick, and has but a narrow cir∣cle
of acquaintance. Those are all of her
own sex, and of the best character; and
she has had the good fortune to preserve
her reputation unsuspected; so that, I hope,
she may yet retrieve her error by an advan∣tageous
match, should Mr. Faulkland still
continue averse to her.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.—I have had a letter
from Patty: she tells me, her master is re∣turned
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
home; and adds, “To be sure,
that vile wicked wretch let him know you
were gone.” She says, he called for the
two dear babes, and kissed them both. Pat∣ty
carried the youngest to him in her arms,
the other in her hand, and she says, he
looked troubled. How came you not to
follow your lady, Mrs. Martha, said he?
She replied, My lady was willing, Sir, that
I should stay to look after the children—
And to be a spy upon my actions, I sup∣pose:
Is not that to be part of your employ∣ment
too? Ah! Patty, Patty; Mrs. Arnold
had better have looked to her own conduct.
Patty made no answer, but retired in tears.
Every one in the house, she writes, is bro∣ken-hearted;
but that Mr. Arnold is never
at home, spending his whole time with
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom the girl, in the over∣flowings
of her zeal for me, heartily exe∣crates.
She informed him, that I was gone
to London, and purposed living with my
mother, who was now there.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 7.—I have just received a let∣ter
from Lady V—. She tells me she sent
twice to invite Mr. Arnold to dine with
them, in order, if possible, to lead him
into a conversation, by which they hoped,
in some measure, to have cleared my inno∣cence,
as my lord could take upon him to
justify Mr. Faulkland; but he declined
coming, not knowing, perhaps, that Mr.
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
Faulkland was absent from V—hall. She
said, her lord had gone to South-Park;
but either Mr. Arnold was not at home, or
denied, himself. My lady adds, “It is a
delicate affair to interpose in; yet would
I have ventured to have wrote to your
husband, if I had been sure that you had
no objection to my telling him, that you
had made me privy to the cause of your
parting: 'tis plain, by his avoiding us,
it is a subject he does not care to come to
an explanation upon. Let me have your
sentiments, and I will act accordingly.”</P>
<P>I shall answer Lady V—'s letter directly,
and beg of her to leave the matter as it is.
Mrs. Gerrarde's testimony will have more
weight than all my good lord or lady could
urge in my favour: besides, they are not
furnished with sufficient weapons to combat
against such an enemy: they know nothing
of Miss Burchell's story; my regard to <HI>her</HI>
character prevented me from giving my la∣dy
this specimen of her aunt's baseness. I
suppose the same reason may have closed
Mr. Faulkland's lips on that subject: so
that they have nothing to alledge against
Mrs. Gerrarde, which would help to inva∣lidate
her testimony with regard to Mr.
Faulkland and me. Mr. Arnold, indeed,
knows that she has forfeited her pretensions
to modesty; but the delusion of self-love
blinds a man in those cases; and he can be∣lieve,
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
that <HI>truth, sincerity,</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> in∣habit
the bosom of her, whose passion for <HI>him</HI>
alone has caused a deviation from chastity.</P>
<P>I cannot think of exposing the poor Miss
Burchell by giving up her secret. Though
it might contribute to clear me, by turning
Mr. Arnold's suspicions on Mrs. Gerrarde,
yet would she have great reason to resent it;
more especially as she is now, by a blame∣less
life, endeavouring to blot out the me∣mory
of her fault. Though my Lady V—
is very prudent, her zeal for me, and my
lord's good-natured earnestness in my cause,
might render them unguarded on the occa∣sion;
and should they attempt to make use
of this secret, in order to criminate Mrs.
Gerrarde, it might, at the same time, bring
malicious censures both on Miss Burchell
and Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>I think, upon the whole, my mother is
the properest person to mediate on this nice
occasion. When Mr. Arnold comes to
town, she can, with due tenderness to the
yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng lady, disclose the whole affair to him.
The knowledge of this black part of Mrs.
Gerrarde's character, joined to her argu∣ments,
may perhaps have some weight;
though, to tell you the secret bodings of my
heart, I expect not much from this. I have
lost my husband's love; Mrs. Gerrarde pos∣sesses
it all; and who knows whether he even
wishes to lose his pretence for abandoning an
unhappy wife? I wish however, Mr. Faulk∣land
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
were returned to V—hall: should Mr.
Arnold know of his absence at this juncture,
he might imagine possibly he was gone in
quest of me.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12.—How the scene is chang∣ed,
my sister! What a melancholy reverse
is here, to my late prospect of domestic
happiness! I pass my nights in tears, and
bitter reflections on my dismal situation.
My days are spent in a painful constraint,
to conceal the anguish of my own heart,
that I may not aggravate that of my
poor mother. My endeavours to be chear∣ful,
I perceive, have a good effect on her:
she is much more composed, and seems re∣signed
to our fate, patiently waiting for a
change. I think too she is rather better in
her health; she has had the advice of a
physician of eminent skill; the medicines
prescribed, he gives us hopes, will keep
her disorder at least from gaining ground;
and that she may hold out for some years.</P>
<P>I have prevailed on her not to give Sir
George an account of my unhappy story,
'till I hear that Mr. Faulkland has left him;
because I know my brother would conceal
nothing from him; and, if possible, I
would have Mr. Arnold's suspicions of <HI>Him</HI>
concealed. I have many reasons for this;
my own delicacy would receive a wound by
it; for who knows what judgement Mr.
Faulkland might form on this knowledge?
But my most material objection is, should
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
he attempt to vindicate his own honour,
what might be the consequence! I shudder
to think of it. I know Mr. Faulkland is
rash, when provoked. Rather let my suf∣ferings
and my disgrace lie wrapped in ob∣livion,
than bring any disaster on the father
of my children.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 16.—Another letter from
Lady V—. She tells me, that Mr. Faulk∣land
is returned from his visit to my brother.
He was soon informed of my parting with
Mr. Arnold; it is the talk of the neighbour∣hood;
every body lays it on Mrs. Gerrarde.
Mr. Faulkland was very inquisitive to learn
particulars from my lady, which, he said,
he was sure I had told her; but she took
care not to give him the least hint which
could lead him to suppose that <HI>He</HI> had any
share in my fate. She says, he raves like a
madman; and that she finds it absolutely
necessary to keep him in ignorance of the
truth. She was obliged to tell him, that
my having discovered Mr. Arnold's amour
with Mrs. Gerrarde, she believed, was the
sole cause of our separation. He asked
her, Was she <HI>sure</HI> there was no other?
adding, That he thought my temper had
been too gentle, to fly, on a sudden, to
such extremes. My lady took occasion to
ask him, Whether he did not visit Mrs.
Gerrarde? He replied, He did sometimes,
having formerly known her at Bath. She
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
concludes with telling me, That Mr. Ar∣nold
is become quite invisible to every friend
he has, Mrs. Gerrarde engrossing him wholly.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. Faulkland may not suspect
how much <HI>He</HI> is concerned in my misfor∣tune:
my absenting myself, for some time
before I left home, from V—hall, and my
departure from my husband, immediately
after my interview with Mr. Faulk∣land
at Mrs. Gerrarde's, may raise some
distrust in his mind; but, while it conti∣tinues
merely surmise, he can have no pre∣tence
for requiring an explanation from Mr.
Arnold; so that, if my husband keeps his
own council, which he seems inclined to do,
and my lord and lady V—preserve the se∣cret,
I shall rest satisfied.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 20.—My mother has wrote
to Sir George, and given him a full account
of my situation, with a request, which I
prevailed on her to make, that he would
not take any notice of the affair 'till he saw
us. My brother, perhaps, may think of a
way, with tenderness and safety, to remove
Mr. Arnold's doubts, without farther ex∣posing
my reputation, or laying my hus∣band
open to mischief. A prudent, cool,
and at the same time zealous friend, might
devise some means to effect this; but I fear
my brother's disregard to Mr. Arnold, his
diminished love for me, and his resentment
to my mother, will prevent him from en∣gaging
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
with that alacrity or precaution that
the nicety of circumstances may require. I
will, therefore, wait with patience, 'till
God, in his own time, shall raise me from
the state of humiliation into which I am
fallen.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22.—With what a tortoise
pace does time advance to the wretched!
how dismal are those hours which are spent
in reflecting on lost happiness. O Faulk∣land!
how light was thy transgression, if
we consider the consequences, compared to
that which has driven me from my home,
and from my children! steeled my husband's
heart against me, heaped infamy on <HI>my</HI>
head, and loaded my mother's age with sor∣row
and remorse! All this is the fatal con∣sequence
of Mr. Arnold's breach of his
marriage-vow: all this, and much more,
I fear, that is to come.</P>
<P>We keep ourselves entirely concealed from
the knowledge of our old acquaintance:
not a mortal visits us, but, now-and-then,
Miss Burchell; and I have never stirred out
of doors but to church.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 28.—Sir George has answered
my mother's letter, just as I feared he would:
he speaks of Mr. Arnold with more con∣tempt
and aversion, than he does of me
with pity or brotherly kindness. He says,
“It is well for him, that Mr. Faulkland
knows not of his injurious suspicion of
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
him, or he would vindicate himself in a
manner he little thinks of.” He tells us,
He does not know (at this distance) how to
advise; but that, as I am of so <HI>patient</HI> and
<HI>forbearing</HI> a spirit, he thinks my wrongs
may sleep 'till he comes to town, which
cannot yet be these three or four weeks,
having leases to renew with his tenants, and
abundance of other business to do in the
country.—So much for George's tender∣ness.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 29.—My comforts are cir∣cumscribed
within a very narrow compass;
for I cannot reckon one, but what I receive
from poor Patty's letters, who never fails to
send me weekly an account of my dear lit∣tle
children. They are all well, thank God,
and not yet abandoned by their father; but
even the knowledge of this is imbittered by
repeated hints of Mr. Arnold's lost condi∣tion.
Lost, I may call it; for his whole
soul is absorbed in the mad pursuit of his
own ruin. The poor girl, in the bitterness
of her indignation, tells me he has made
Mrs. Gerrarde a present of a favourite little
pad of mine: she says, she had a mind to
tear her off, when she saw her mounted up∣on
it.</P>
<P>I wish not to be told of any of Mr. Ar∣nold's
motions, and should forbid Patty to
write to me any thing on the subject, but
that I fear my letter might fall into Mr.
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
Arnold's hands: his curiosity might lead
him to open it (for the conscious mind will
descend to meannesses); and, if he should
see my prohibition, he would be satisfied
that his servant was too free in her censures.
I am sure he is quite unconcerned at <HI>my</HI>
knowing his conduct; but I would not ne∣vertheless,
for my children's sake, bring
this tender, faithful poor creature into dis∣grace
with him, by convincing him of the
liberty she takes, though he may very na∣turally
suspect it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30.—A lady of our acquaint∣ance,
who happened to see me at church,
came to pay me a visit to-day. It seems,
she is intimate with the widow Arnold, who
told her, very lately, that she was impati∣ent
for the commencement of term, as she
then expected the cause depending between
her and us would be brought to a final issue,
and determined entirely in her child's fa∣vour.
This account alarmed my poor
mother so much, that she could not be easy
'till she sent for our lawyer, who was so
obliging as to come upon the first summons.
She acquainted him with the cause of her
apprehensions; and asked him whether
there was any likelyhood of the widow's
succeeding. He laughed at my mother's
fears, and at our antagonist's flourishes, as
he called them; and said, he would not
give a bent six-pence to ensure Mr. Arnold's
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
estate to him, which the ensuing term, he
says, will put out of the reach of doubt.
This assurance has quieted our anxiety on
that head. The loss of our suit would in∣deed
be a dreadful blow, as we should have
nothing then remaining but my small join∣ture,
for the support of Mr. Arnold, my∣self,
and our two children; not to mention
Mrs. Gerrarde, who, I have reason to be∣lieve,
has been no inconsiderable sharer in
Mr. Arnold's fortune.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 4.—Six melancholy weeks
are gone since I have been here, I may say,
both a prisoner, and a fugitive. I count the
days as they pass, as if I expected some re∣volution
in my fate; yet, whence is it to
come? No prospect as yet opens to me.
Mr. Arnold's law-affairs will soon call him
to town: something may then happen—But
does not Mrs. Gerrarde come too? He
cannot live without her; and I shall reap no
benefit from this, but the chance of seeing
my children sometimes perhaps; though he
may not bring them with him, or, if he
does, he may be cruel enough to refuse me
the sight of them. Sir George is cold and
dilatory: were he on the spot, something
might be done; he might expostulate: my
mother too could join arguments to intrea∣ties:
Mr. Arnold perhaps might be recover∣ed
from his delusion; it is but a per∣haps.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280"/>
<HI>November</HI> 15.—My brother is arrived in
town sooner than we expected, and came
this evening to pay us a visit. My altered
and dejected looks, I believe, shocked him;
but George wants tenderness, or at least a
capacity of shewing it. After a recapitula∣tion
of my story, he asked me, “Could I
be so mean-spirited a creature as ever to
think of living with Arnold again, even
though he should be inclined to desire it?”
I told him, he considered the matter in a
wrong light; and that he ought to reflect on
my reputation, and the future welfare of my
two poor little girls, who would be material
sufferers, from the want of my care and at∣tention,
as they grew up; not to mention
the disadvantages they would enter into life
with, by my continuing under an aspersion
which might in time become very public,
and perhaps be believed too, as I made no
doubt but that Mrs. Gerrarde would take
pains to propagate it wherever she went.
My mother added, Mr. Arnold too might
be saved from perdition, if he could be so
far convinced of his wife's innocence, as to
be reconciled to her, and live with her a∣gain.
And pray, said Sir George, how is
this to be done, if that damned woman
has put it into his head, that Faulkland and
you are fond of one another? Do you ima∣gine
that he will believe what <HI>you</HI> say?
what your brother, or your mother, or even
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
Faulkland himself, could say to the contrary?
I own to you very fairly, that I so much de∣spise
the man, that, unless you will give me
leave to talk to him my own way, I will have
nothing to say to him at all. Would you
have me <HI>sue</HI> to him for a reconciliation, and
try to persuade him out of the belief of an
imaginary injury, which probably he was glad
to make a handle of to get rid of you? No,
Sidney; you may be as tame as you please
yourself, but it does not become your bro∣ther
to be so. When I go to him, I must
insist upon not having rules prescribed to me:
your delicacy, in regard to Faulkland's as∣serting
your innocence, I have nothing to say
against; but there can be no objection to
your brother's vindicating the honour of his
family. I saw Sir George's resentment was
roused to the highest pitch; his eyes spark∣led
with indignation, and his whole frame
seemed agitated.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear brother,</OPENER>
<P>said I, I conjure you, (and
I fell upon my knees and clasped both my
arms round his) do not add to my affliction,
by involving yourself and my husband in a
fatal quarrel. What difference would it
make to me if Mr. Arnold should fall, whe∣ther
it is by your hand, or Mr. Faulkland's?
The loss would be the same; the misfortune,
the publication of my disgrace, the same.
Your husband, said he, breaking from me,
though a little softened, would have as good
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
a chance as I, if it came to the hazard; or
perhaps he might condescend to take you
again (if you will have it so,) without coming
to these extremities, if I am suffered to ar∣gue
properly with him—I will not consent
to your seeing him at all, said I, eagerly.
The cause is now my own, he answered,
coolly; but I will do nothing to aggravate
your distress. I did not like the manner in
which he spoke. My mother, who 'till now
had been silent, caught the alarm. Let me in∣treat
you, son, said she, to drop the thoughts
of any violent methods with Mr. Arnold.
If you value your sister's peace, or have
any regard to the obedience you owe me, I
insist on it, that you neither see him nor write
to him, without our knowledge and consent;
and if you do not promise me this, I re∣nounce
all ties of kindred or affection to you:
your mother has as just a sense of the ho∣nour
of her family as you can have; but it
is not on so hot a head, and so weak an arm,
that she depends to see it justified to the
world. Sir George, who was nettled at my
mother's spirited rebuke, made her a low
bow. No doubt of it, madam, said he,
there will be a miracle wrought in my sister's
favour. I would have you let her try the
experiment of the ordeal: I dare say she
would come off victorious, and then Mr.
Arnold will do you the favour to take her
home again. I wish, said my mother, gravely,
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
that there was a possibility of bringing my
dear child's innocence to such a proof; I
would not hesitate a minute to put it to the
trial: but since there is no such a thing <HI>now-a-days,</HI>
I will wait 'till God, in his own
righteousness, shall judge her cause, and
clear her to the world. Therefore, son, I
insist upon your promise before you leave
me.</P>
<P>I give you my word, madam, answered
Sir George, I will not attempt to hold any
conference with Mr. Arnold without your
knowledge. Will that satisfy you? It does,
answered my mother; for I think I can rely
upon your word. Sir George left us not
very well satisfied with each other; his pride
and resentment piqued to the highest. I
cannot censure him for it here: he has cause;
but the case is a nice and difficult one. The
gratification of a private spleen ought not to
enter into the measures he should pursue.
Glad I am that my mother's properly-exerted
resolution has tamed him a little. Though
George sometimes fails in the respect which
he owes her, yet I never knew him wilfully
to disobey her commands, or oppose her
inclinations. 'Tis well there is any hold on
a disposition so ungentle and self-willed as
his.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 18.—My brother has taken a
very handsome house in Pall-mall, and told
my mother, between jest and earnest, he is
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
going to give her a daughter-in-law, to make
up for the loss of her son-in-law. He is, in
reality, making his addresses to lady Sarah
P. the daughter of a new-created peer. She
has a great fortune, he tells me; but I know
nothing more of her. I wish him better
success in his nuptials (if they take place)
than I have had.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 20.—Mr. Arnold is arrived in
town: he came late last night, and his man
called this morning to enquire how I did.
The poor fellow stole out before his master
was up; and was afraid of staying a minute,
lest he should be wanted at home. I called
him up to the dining-room: I saw an honest
shame and sorrow in his countenance. How
does your master do, Frank, said I? Has
he brought the children to town? No, ma∣dam,
said he; but they are pure and hearty.
I believe my master thought it a pity to bring
them out of the fresh air, as long as Mrs.
Patty is there to look after them. They are
better where they are. I asked him was Mr.
Arnold come to town to make any stay? I
believe for good-and-all, said he. This
ugly law-suit, to be sure, will detain him;
but he is come <HI>alone,</HI> said he, with an intel∣ligent
nod: I don't suppose though he will
continue long so. Well, Frank, said I, I
am glad to hear your master and the child∣ren
are well. Ah, madam! shaking his
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
head as he opened the door to go out, it was
a woeful day for us when you left South
Park. God give every one their reward!</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 22.—I have not seen my bro∣ther
these two days: he does not know, I
believe, that Mr. Arnold is come to town;
though, if he did, I am sure he will not
break his word; so that I am easy on that
particular. My mother says she will go to
Mr. Arnold herself, to <HI>reason</HI> with him a
little. I shall not oppose it, though I have
no hopes of her being able to effect any thing
in my favour: she is now laid up with a
cold, and is not able to come out of her
room; but she pleases herself with the
thoughts of this visit, as soon as she is able
to make it. She has planned what she in∣tends
to say to him; and is resolved to let
him into the whole history of Miss Burchell,
that he may know, she says, the full extent
of Mrs. Gerrarde's wickedness; as what is
there of which that woman is not capable,
who could set to sale the honour of an in∣nocent,
unsuspecting creature, left to her
guardianship?</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 23.—Amazing, my dear
Cecilia! I thought I should wonder no more
at any thing, yet is my wonder now raised
to astonishment—I have just received a let∣ter
from lady V—. I have read it over and
over again, and yet scarce can believe my
senses. Here it is in her own words.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="286"/>
“I suppose you know, my dear Mrs. Ar∣nold,
that your husband is in town; and
that he left Mrs Gerrarde behind him for
no other reason, I imagine, but that he
did not chuse to be quite so scandalous as
to let her travel with him; for we heard
that she purposed following him in a few
days. Patty, I conclude, may have in∣formed
you of thus much; but the extra∣ordinary
part of the intelligence, I believe,
is reserved for me to acquaint you with.
Know then that Mrs. Gerrarde is eloped,
no-body knows whither. <HI>Good,</HI> say you;
good, should <HI>I</HI> say too; but for the con∣clusion
of my story. It is with Mr. <HI>Faulk∣land</HI>
she is eloped: 'tis positively true;
she went off with him in triumph last
night in her own chariot, and neither of
them have been heard of since. I own I
am so much confounded at this, I scarce
know what I write.”</P>
<P>“I am very glad, for your sake, that bad
creature has quitted your husband; but
that she should have drawn my cousin
Faulkland in, is matter of serious concern
to me. It is evident the plan was previ∣ously
concerted between them; for I am
informed to-day, that Mrs. Gerrarde's
maid decamped at the same time, and
took with her every thing valuable belong∣ing
to her mistress, several of her drawers
being found open and empty. Mr. Faulk∣land's
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
servants have also disappeared; so
that we cannot conjecture which way they
are gone.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Faulkland, who was about leaving
us, asked my permission to give a ball to
the neighbouring ladies in our new room,
which is just finished. As I concluded he
would ask no-body but our own acquaint∣ance,
I readily consented; and my lord,
you know, is fond of those frolics. I own
I was surprized to see Mrs. Gerrarde
amongst the company, as undaunted as
the <HI>modestest</HI> face there. I would not how∣ever
affront Mr. Faulkland so much, as
to shew any disrepect to one, who was, at
that time, <HI>his</HI> guest; but I was out of all
patience to find that <HI>she,</HI> along with several
others, was asked to supper; my too-good-natured
lord joining in the invitation.
Mr. Faulkland made a pretence to wait on
her home, and the audacious creature took
that opportunity to march off with him.”</P>
<P>“Now, as Faulkland really purposed
leaving V—hall the next day, I think it
would have been but decent in him to have
forebore this piece of barefaced libertinism,
'till he was fairly from under <HI>our</HI> roof. He
have made his assignation in any other
place; but, I suppose, the lady had a mind
to shew the world she is above restraint,
and chose to make her infamy a sort of
triumph.”</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="288"/>
“sI am quite angry with my lord, for only
laughing at this, and calling it a piece of
spirited gallantry in them both. He says, he
is delighted to think how your good man
will shake his ears, when he hears his mi∣stress
has left him in the lurch and gone off
with another lover. I should smile too; but
that it makes me sad to think, that Mr.
Faulkland, of whom I had so good an opini∣on,
should so impose upon my judgement,
and forfeit his own character, for so vile a
creature.”</P>
<P>“Pardon me, my dear madam; I am so
full of my own reflections, on the interest
<HI>I</HI> take in this affair, that I have been sor∣getful
of how much more moment it may
be to <HI>you.</HI> Heaven grant that your hus∣band
may think of making himself
amends, in returning to a faithful and ami∣able
wife, for the loss of a deceitful, jilt∣ing
mistress. Surely this event must open
his eyes, or he deserves to lose them. I
hope to embrace you in London in a very
little time: 'till then, believe me,”</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Well, my Cecilia, what say you to this?
Are you not as much surprized as I am? Mr.
Faulkland to emerge at last the favourite
gallant of Mrs. Gerrarde! Prodigious! I
confess, my dear, I am so selfish as not to
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
participate with lady V—in her unea∣siness
on this occasion. That Mrs. Gerrarde
flies from my husband, I am glad; and that
Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI> is the very man she chose to fly
with, I am still gladder: he, of all men
living, I would have wished (though least
expected) to be the person. This explains
every thing that is passed. Surely as lady
V—says, this <HI>must</HI> open Mr. Arnold's
eyes. I can now discover a double reason
for my poor deluded man's having his ima∣gination
poisoned with jealousy. Mrs. Ger∣rarde
did not aim singly at separating my
husband and me: this, perhaps, was but a
secondary consideration; or who knows
whether it was at all intended? But she most
certainly designed to secure herself against all
suspicions, by making me the object of them;
and effectually to blind Mr. Arnold, per∣suaded
him, that Mr. Faulkland's visits,
made to her, were only in the hope of seeing
me.</P>
<P>Let her views have been what they would,
this event was beyond my hopes. Some
glimmerings of comfort begin to break in
upon me. Methinks my heart feels much
lighter than it did. How Sir George will
stare at this account! My mother will lift up
her eyes; but she has no opinion of Mr.
Faulkland's morals, and therefore will be
less surprized. I pity Miss Burchell: this is
an irremediable bar to our hopes; faint and
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
unsupported as they were made before, they
must now entirely vanish.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24.—I gave you a copy of
lady V—'s letter, while the subject was
warm at my heart, and before I shewed it to
any one; but my mother and my brother
have now both seen it. My mother (just as
I expected,) without any great emotions of
surprize, only exclaimed against their wick∣edness;
but said, she could not help rejoicing
in it, as <HI>I,</HI> she hoped, would derive happi∣ness
from their accumulated crimes. Sir
George read the letter twice over before he
uttered a word; and then said, It was <HI>strange;</HI>
upon his soul, most unaccountable; and that
either Faulkland was run mad, or that wo∣man
had bewitched him. When he was
with me at Sidney-Castle, he did not, said he,
so much as mention her. I asked him, whe∣ther
he was acquainted with Mr. Arnold (for
I had written him word of your marriage,
when he was abroad?) He told me, he had
seen both you and him two or three times, at
lord V—'s; but that, as he did not wish to
renew his acquaintance with you, he had ne∣ver
visited your husband. I presume he
was not then a stranger to his connection
with Mrs. Gerrarde; at least to the conjec∣tures
of the neighbourhood upon it: but as
it was then but a matter of opinion, and he
knew not of the difference between you and
your husband, 'tis probable he did not chuse
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
to disgust me more against my brother-in-law,
by hinting at this circumstance. He
expressed great acknowledgements to my
mother, when I told him of the notice she
had taken of Miss Burchell; though, he
said, he found (from my account of your
marriage) that she had deferred her confer∣ence
with that young lady, 'till it was too
late for her testimony to be of any service
to him. As I knew nothing of what had
passed between my mother and Miss Burchell,
I could give him no satisfaction on that sub∣ject;
and the recollection of past transactions
being equally disagreeable to us both, I
avoided ever mentioning them after our first
conversation; nor do I remember that Mrs.
Gerrarde's name occurred once.</P>
<P>My mother now began to exult over Sir
George, and took advantage of the surprize
and consternation that Lady V—'s letter had
thrown him into. This is your boasted
friend, said she,; the man whose <HI>honour</HI> and
<HI>generosity</HI> were not to be questioned, and
whose <HI>utmost</HI> crime was a youthful folly that
he was surprized into with a silly girl. I am
pleased, however, that <HI>this</HI> has proved I was
not so grosly mistaken in believing him a
loose man. Mrs. Gerrarde is the fittest mate
for him, and I am glad they are gone toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Sir George was too much mortified at the
flagrant misconduct of his friend to attempt
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
excusing him: he contented himself with re∣peating,
It was the strangest thing he ever
knew in his life.</P>
<P>My mother then told him Mr. Arnold was
come to town; and that, as things had taken
such a turn, she hoped herself to be able to
bring him to the use of his judgment; and
therefore thought it would not be at all ne∣cessary
for my brother to interfere. Sir
George said, With all his heart; if her la∣dyship
should be able to patch up a reconcili∣ation
that would save his sister's credit, and
she could be so <HI>extremely</HI> pliant as to think
of living with such a husband again, he
should not give himself any further trouble
about the matter; but in <HI>his</HI> opinion, the
affair wore a much odder aspect than it did
before. I find Mr. Faulkland's behaviour
sticks with him, and has a little cooled his
zeal towards him.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 25—I have had a letter
from Patty, who confirms my lady V—'s
account of the lovers flight; and she tells
me one of Mrs. Gerrarde's servants is gone
off express to town; I suppose to bring Mr.
Arnold the news: for they are all in confusi∣on
at her house, and know not what is be∣come
of their mistress; but they are certain
she is gone with Mr. Faulkland. Patty
adds, The servants believe this scheme had
been long concerted, Mr. Faulkland having
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
been a private visitor to their mistress for a
good while.</P>
<P>I must confess I am astonished at it: it
has sunk the man extremely in my opinion.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 26. Miss Burchell has just been
here. Poor creature she is quite stunned
with the news: she could scarce believe it at
first, 'till my mother desired I would shew
her lady V—'s and Patty's letter, which cor∣roborated
all she said. She then gave way to
tears and lamentations; saying, That cruel
woman was born to be the destruction of eve∣ry-body
she had any connection with. <HI>I</HI> have
found it so; <HI>you,</HI> madam (to me), have done
so too; Mr. Arnold, I believe, has been a
great sufferer; Mr. Faulkland is <HI>now</HI> her
victim. Inconsiderate and barbarous as he
is, I grieve for him.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 30.—I have heard nothing of
Mr. Arnold. Indeed it is hardly possible
that I should: we are shut up here from all
commerce with the world. My mother's
illness has confined her to her bed-chamber;
we admit no visitors, and I never leave her.
I long to know how he takes the ingra∣titude
of his mistress; but I see no-body
who converses with him. My brother and
Miss Burchell are the only people we see.
The latter is pretty often with us; as for Sir
George, he only looks in upon us now and
then, and we all seem in an aukward situa∣tion.
I wish my mother were well enough
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
to call on Mr. Arnold: I am very anxious
to know what his sentiments are; at least in
regard to Mrs. Gerrarde.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 6.—I have been almost asleep,
my dear Cecilia, for this week past; but I
have been rouzed this morning in a most ex∣traordinary
manner. Sir George called on
us; he ran up stairs in a violent hurry; and
had a countenance when he entered the room;
that spoke wonders before he opened his
mouth. He hardly gave himself time to ask
me how I did (though he had not seen me
for three days), before he took a bundle of
papers out of his pocket, which he gave me.
'Tis from Faulkland, said he, and may be
worth your knowledge. Upon opening the
cover, I found it contained at least, four
sheets of paper, written on every side. Bless
me, brother, said I, do you expect I should
take the trouble to read all this? He an∣swered,
You may read it at your leisure: you
will find it will pay you for the the mighty
trouble of a perusal. Sir George left me
presently; and having read this extraordinary
letter to myself, for I happened to be in my
own room when my brother came to me, I
sate me down to give you a copy of it. My
mother, who coughed almost the whole
night, is now endeavouring to get a little
sleep; so that I will scribble on as fast as I
can, while I have no interruption.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>Nov. 30, 1704.</DATE></DATELINE>
My dear Bidulph,</OPENER>
<P>I am in haste to vindicate myself to you,
but in much more haste to do so to Mrs.
Arnold; who, if she bestows a thought at
all on me, must, I am sure, hold me in the
utmost contempt; and great reason would
she have, if things were always as they ap∣pear.
Methinks I see her beautiful scorn at
hearing I had carried off Mrs. Gerrarde.
What a paltry fellow <HI>you</HI> must think me too.
And yet I <HI>have</HI> carried her off, and she is
now in my possession, not displeased with
her situation; and I might, if I would, be as
happy as Mrs. Gerrarde can make me: but
I assure you, Sir George, I have no designs
but what are for the good both of her soul
and body; and I have hitherto treated her
like a vestal. What a paradox is here,
say you? But have patience 'till I tell you
the story of my knight-errantry.</P>
<P>You are to know then, that as Arnold's
amour with Mrs. Gerrarde was no secret at
V—hall, from the moment I heard it, I
meditated a design of breaking the detestable
union; not out of regard either to him or
her, but in hopes of restoring, to the most
amiable of women, a besotted husband's
heart, which nothing but downright magic,
infernal witchcraft, could have robbed her
of. The woman is handsome, 'tis true;
but she is a silly toad, and as fantastic as an
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
ape. I had formed this design, I say, from
the first notice I had of the intrigue; and in
consequence of this, resolved to renew my
acquaintance with Mrs. Gerrarde: for I had
<HI>known</HI> her before; known her to my cost.
She it was, this identical devil, whom I have
now in my power, that was the cause of Miss
Burchell's misfortune; and therefore the re∣mote
cause of my losing Miss Bidulph. Had
it not been for her, I should never have had
the fall of that unhappy girl to answer for.
<HI>I</HI> should not, I say, (mark that); for the
mercenary witch was determined to sell her
to somebody, when my ill stars threw me in
her way. I do not rank this affair in the
number of capital crimes; and yet I never
think of it without a pang. If half of my
fortune would retrieve the girl's peace of
mind, I would give it freely: but it is past
now, and cannot be helped. She had the
good fortune never to be suspected; and if
she keeps her own council, probably never
will. If I die a batchelor (as I believe I
shall,) I will leave her my whole fortune.
What can a man do more?</P>
<P>How I ramble from my subject! I meant
only to tell you what my design was in carry∣ing
off Mrs. Gerrarde. In order to effect it,
as I said before, it was necessary for me to
renew my acquaintance with her; and ac∣cordingly
I put on a bold face, and made
her a visit. She was not surprized at this, our
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
former intimacy giving a sufficient pretence
for it. She received me with a pleased fa∣miliarity,
which convinced me my company
was far from being disagreeable to her; and
I am sure, had my views been other than they
were, I should have met with as kind a recep∣ption
as my heart could have wished; for she
certainly thought of retaining me in her service
unknown to Arnold. I was soon aware of
this; for, though she often desired to see me,
she always contrived it at such times, as she
was sure, of not being surprized by him.
This was, in some measure, meeting my
purpose half way; but though I wanted to
disengage her from Arnold, I did not mean
to sacrifice myself to her; and our views, in
the material point, were very different: mine
were only to part her from her gallant; her's
were to share her favours between us: for
she did not intend to let go her hold on him;
and I believe my backwardness, in pushing
my good fortune, began to disgust her; but
the time for carrying my plan into execution
was not yet arrived; it could not be 'till Ar∣nold's
departure from South-Park. I meant
to carry Mrs. Gerrarde away with the appear∣ance
of her own consent; and I knew this
was impossible, whilst her lover remained so
near her. I had formed but a rough sketch
of my plan when I received your letter,
which summoned me to Sidney-Castle; and
I resolved not to apprize you of it, 'till my
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
enterprize was crowned with success; more
especially as you were then quite ignorant of
your sister's wrongs.</P>
<P>On my return from visiting you, the first
news I heard at V—hall was, that Mr. Ar∣nold
and his lady were parted. I curst my
own dilatoriness, that I had not executed my
plan before things were brought to such ex∣tremities;
for I well knew it was that artful
fiend who had occasioned it, though I then
little thought how fatally <HI>I</HI> had contributed
towards the misfortune of the ever-amiable
and most respectable of women.</P>
<P>Lady V—told me, that your sister,
having discovered her husband's infidelity,
had left him on that account; but my lord
soon let me into the whole secret. Oh! Sir
George, that angel, who deserved the first
monarch in the universe, to be cast off by
an undiscerning dolt! and <HI>I,</HI> tho' innocent∣ly,
the accursed cause. I cannot think with
patience of what the divine creature has suf∣fered
on my account; but was it not all,
from the beginning, owing to Mrs. Ger∣rarde,
that avenging fury, sent on earth as a
scourge for the sins of me and of my ances∣tors;—I
rave—but no wonder—I am
mad upon this subject.—But to return: I
then recollected, that the day before I set out
for Sidney-Castle, I received a message from
Mrs. Gerrarde in the morning, desiring my
company to drink coffee with her that even∣ing.
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
I obeyed the summons, little expecting
to meet Mrs. Arnold at her house, whom I
had never seen there before. The effect my
presence had on her extremely surprized me:
she presently quitted the room. Mrs. Ger∣rarde
took that opportunity of telling me,
that she had dropped in on her very unex∣pectedly;
but as she supposed she would go
directly away, we should have an hour to
chat by ourselves. She then followed your
sister out, and I remained alone in the par∣lour.
Whilst I was reflecting on this odd
rencounter, which I did not then imagine
had been brought about by design, Mrs.
Gerrarde came into me, saying, your sister
was so ill she was under a necessity of ac∣companying
her home, and had ordered her
chariot for that purpose: she made an apo∣logy
for being obliged to leave me, and said
she should be glad to see me the next day.
I took my leave and in going out saw Mr.
Arnold at the door, which I judged was
the true reason of Mrs. Gerrarde's dis∣missing
me.</P>
<P>I set out for Wiltshire the next morning;
and though there was something odd in the
whole of this incident, I believed it was owing
to chance alone, and thought no more of it;
'till upon my Lord V—'s telling me the
true cause of your sister's disgrace, I found
that this serpent had laid the whole plan on
purpose to destroy her. You see (for to be
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
sure you know all the particulars) how she
seduced the innocent Mrs. Arnold into this
fatal visit, having first engaged me to come
at the very point of time when she knew the
husband would surprize us; for <HI>his</HI> coming,
you may be satisfied, was not unexpected.</P>
<P>I own to you, Sir George, in the first mo∣tions
of my rage, I could have stabbed Ar∣nold,
Mrs. Gerrarde and myself; but my
Lord V—calmed my transports, by telling
me that it was your sister's earnest request
that this detestable secret should be kept
from my knowledge; and that lady V—,
who had entrusted him with it, would never
forgive him if she knew he had divulged it.
This reflection brought me back to my senses,
and I burned with impatience to execute my
first plan, which Mrs. Gerrarde's repeated
crimes now called upon me to accelerate. I
communicated my design to lord V—, who
was delighted with it; for he perfectly
adores your sister. This, said he, though
not such a vengeance as that wicked woman
deserves, must, in the end, be productive of
what you wish, and Mrs. Arnold may be re∣stored
to her peace, without injury to her
character, or mischief to any-body.</P>
<P>Having settled my measures with lord
V—, I went to pay a visit to Mrs.
Gerrarde. The cockatrice affected to speak
with surprize and concern of your sister's
separation from her husband. I asked her,
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
had she, who was so intimate with both,
heard any reason assigned for it? She shook
her head, and by a pretended sorrow in her
looks, and a mysterious silence, invited me
to press for an explanation of her meaning.
She told me at length, with a seeming reluct∣ance,
that “poor Mrs. Arnold, though to
be sure she was a sensible woman, was not
without the little frailties and passions of
her sex; and that <HI>astonishing</HI> and <HI>groundless</HI>
as her suspicions were, she had taken it
into her head to be jealous of Mr. Arnold;
and with whom do you think, of all peo∣ple
in the world, she suspects him?” I can∣not
imagine, said I. Why truly with <HI>me,</HI>
replied the undaunted Jezabel, and looked
as if she expected <HI>I</HI> should be as much
amazed as she pretended to be. I affected
to laugh at it; and changing the discourse,
put an end to my visit.</P>
<P>The measures I had to observe required
some management. It would not answer
the full extent of my purpose to rob Mr.
Arnold of his dear, if it did not appear at
the same time that she had left him with her
consent. To bring about this it was necessary
that the flight on her part should seem pre∣meditated;
which would not carry any face,
unless she took with her such of her move∣ables
as were most valuable. This I knew
could not be done without the assistance of
her maid, whom I therefore not only resolved
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
to trust, but also to make her a partner in
her mistress's elopement.</P>
<P>Having settled thus much of my plan in
my own mind, I began my operations, by
making the maid presents every time I vi∣sited
the mistress; and I took care to give
these visits as much the air of an amour as I
possibly could. I dare swear the girl thought
Mrs. Gerrarde and I were upon the best
terms imaginable. I affected to come at
such hours as I was sure Mrs. Gerrarde was
alone; I always made my visits very short,
as if through fear of being surprized with
her; and went so far as to leave my chariot
(when I came in it) at a distance from the
house, and walked to it alone, with the cau∣tion
of one fearful of being observed. It
was a matter of indifference to me whether
Mrs. Gerrarde knew of this or not; my
business was only to excite suspicions of an
intrigue amongst her servants, in order to
answer a future purpose: but if she were to
know with what extreme precaution I visited
her, my prudence could not but be very agree∣able
to her: she had her measures to observe
as well as myself. As it was of consequence
to her to conceal our acquaintance from Ar∣nold's
knowledge, she must necessarily be
pleased at the pains I took (without her lay∣ing
herself open in making the request) to
conceal it from him; and she saw I was
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
as careful as she could wish, never to interfere
with him.</P>
<P>In short, we carried on a private inter∣course,
that, if it could not be called gal∣lantry,
was something very like it; for I
amused, complimented, and flattered her so
agreeably, that I believe she began to think
herself sure of me, and wondered I did not
make a better use of the favourable disposi∣tion
she was in towards me; but I trifled
with such dexterity, that even she, with all
the cunning she is mistress of, could not pos∣sibly
fathom my design.</P>
<P>Having thus laid the foundation of my
plot, I made no doubt of being able to exe∣cute
it, with my lord V—'s assistance: he
was in raptures at the thoughts of our enter∣prize,
and swore he would never have for∣given
me, if I had not allowed him a share
in it. He said, I would give my right-hand
to make Mrs. Arnold happy; adding, be∣sides
it will save her husband from destructi∣on;
for, to my knowledge, that woman has
already almost ruined his fortune.</P>
<P>I asked him, might we venture to let my
lady into the secret? He said, by no means;
my lady was too squeamish to be trusted with
such a notable exploit; but, when the af∣fair
was over, he would take upon him to ex∣cuse
me to her, after he had diverted him∣self
a little with her surprize.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="304"/>
I fretted to death at Arnold's staying so
long in the country, as it delayed my enter∣prize.
There was one circumstance that a
little compensatsd for this vexation; and that
was, that my long stay at V—hall, which
could be no secret to him, though he drop∣ped
visiting there on purpose to avoid me,
might in some measure help to efface his in∣jurious
suspicions with regard to his lady and
me; besides, it gave the better colour to
my other designs.</P>
<P>At last the long-sought-for opportunity
arrived. Arnold was obliged to go to Lon∣don
on his Law-affairs. I took care to in∣form
myself of the day from Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
maid; and learnt at the same time
that her mistress purposed going to town in
a week after; for she still endeavoured to
save appearances, and dared to the last to
pretend to reputation. I proposed giving a
ball, to take my leave of the ladies, on the
night subsequent to the day fixed for Arnold's
departure from South-park. My lord, al∣most
as anxious for the event as myself, im∣mediatly
dispatched invitations all over the
neighbourhood: there was not a person of
any fashion left unasked. Mr. Arnold and
Mrs. Gerrarde, you may be sure, were not
forgot. From the former, as we expected,
we received a civil apology; from the latter,
a message that she would be sure to come.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="305"/>
This was at the distance of eight days
from the appointed time. In the interim,
I continued to visit Mrs. Gerrarde as usual,
and took care to bespeak her for a partner.
Arnold went to town as opportunely as we
could wish. I called on Mrs. Gerrarde the
same morning; and having my lord's per∣mission
for it, engaged her to come early
enough to drink tea, as there were a great
many ladies invited for the same purpose;
and, at going away, I dropped a few mys∣terious
hints to her maid.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a very large
company met at V—hall; and having con∣certed
my whole plan, when the ladies were
engaged at the tea-table, I slipped out,
mounted my horse, and rode to Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
house. I desired to see her maid;
and, taking her aside, told her not to be
surprized; but that her lady was to go off
with me that night: that the thing had, for
certain reasons, not been determined on
'till that very evening: that I had just
snatched a minute to desire her to get all
her ladies trinkets together, and whatever
money and bills▪ she might have in her es∣crutore,
In order to this, I gave a parcel
of small keys, which I had carried in my
pocket for the purpose; and bid her hold
herself in readiness against seven o'clock,
when a person should call on her, who would
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
conduct her to a place where she would find
her lady and me.</P>
<P>I needed no arguments to persuade the
girl; the thing appeared plausible enough:
she was fully convinced of the intimacy be∣tween
her mistress and me; and knowing
her too well to have a doubt of her base∣ness,
she concluded I acted by Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
directions, and promised punctually
to obey them. She said, she could easily
convey away in the dark as many things as
she could conveniently carry; and, to a∣void
observation from the rest of the ser∣vants,
she would wait at a cottage hard by,
which she named to me, 'till her conductor
arrived.</P>
<P>Whether any of the keys I gave her
would fit the locks or not, I was not much
concerned; if they did not, I concluded
she would think her mistress had made a mis∣take;
and that she would force them open,
rather than fail. Having settled this material
point, I got back to my Lord V—'s, with∣out
having been missed by the company.</P>
<P>Our ball was very well conducted; I
danced with Mrs. Gerrarde, and we passed
a very agreeable evening. We supped at
twelve, and she had ordered her chariot to
come a little after that hour; but I had given
my fellows their cue. As the dancing was
not renewed, the company broke up be∣tween
one and two. Mrs. Gerrarde was
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
one of the first that offered to go; but as
her servants were not to be found, she was
detained 'till every body else had taken their
leave. At length her coachman and foot∣man
were found in the cellar, with one of
my men, all so drunk that they were not
able to stand. Her servants were really so,
and mine counterfeited so well, there was
no discovering the cheat. In this emergen∣cy,
nothing was more natural than the
offering my servants to attend her home,
and of course to wait on her myself to see
her safe. She readily accepted the first of∣fer,
but declined the other. This was easily
got over; I handed her into her chariot,
and stepped in after her. Our route was
settled: we drove from my lord V—'s
door; and turning short from the road
that led to Mrs. Gerrarde's house, we struck
down a lane which was to carry us by cross∣roads
to our first destined stage, which was
at the distance of seven miles. This was
no other than a poor gardener's house, to
which place two of my emissaries had been
dispatched that day to wait our coming,
with a travelling chariot, and 4 stout horses.
I had taken care, according to promise, to
send a trusty groom for the maid, with a
boy to carry her luggage. They were both
well mounted, and had orders to carry her
to an inn on the road to Rochester, and
within about a mile of the town. This inn
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
was kept by a fellow, who had formerly
been my servant; I had placed him there,
and he was entirely at my devotion. He
had already received his instructions, and his
house was to be our second stage. I con∣cluded
the maid had arrived there long be∣fore
us, having had six or seven hours the
start of us, and the place was not more
than twenty miles from her own house.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde was not immediately aware
of our going out of the road; she was in
high spirits, and I kept her in chat. As
soon as she perceived it, she cried out, with
some surprize, Lord, Mr. Faulkland! where
is the fellow carrying us? He has missed his
way. She called to him; but the coach∣man,
who had orders not to stop unless I
spoke to him, only drove the faster. Pray
do call to him, said she; the wretch has
certainly got drunk with the rest of the ser∣vants.
I told her there was no possibility of
turning in the narrow road in which we
then were: that when we got out of it, I
would speak to the coachman; and begged
of her, in the mean while, not to be fright∣ened.
The lane was a very long one, but
our rapid wheels soon carried us to the end
of it, where I had appointed Pivet and one
of my footmen to meet us on horseback. I
had another servant behind the chariot, whom
I purposed to send back with it in the morning.</P>
<P>At the sight of two horsemen, who were
apparently waiting for us, she screamed
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
out, Oh! the villain he has brought us here
to be robbed. She had a good many jew∣els
on her, and, to say the truth, had some
reason for her fears. The chariot had now
got on a good open road, and the horses ra∣ther
flew than galloped. The two horsemen
joined us, and kept up with us at full speed.
I saw she was heartily frightened, and
thought it time to undeceive her. I was
not ill-natured enough to keep her longer
under the apprehensions of highwaymen,
and thought she would be less shocked at
finding there was a design upon her person,
than on her diamond ear-rings. Now, said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
taking one of her hands with rather more
freedom than respect, since we are out of
all danger of discovery, or any possibility
of pursuit, I will tell you a secret; and I
spoke with an easy assured tone. She drew
her hand away. What do you mean, Sir?
Nothing, madam, but to have the pleasure
of your company in a little trip I am going
to take: believe me, you are not in the least
danger; you are under my protection;
those are my servants that you see riding
with us; and you may judge of the value
I set upon you, by the pains I have taken
to get you into my possession. Lord, Mr.
Faulkland! why sure you can't be serious!
Never more so in my life, madam; I have
long had a design upon you; but your con∣nection
with Mr. Arnold—<HI>My</HI> connection
with Mr. Arnold, Sir! interrupting me; I
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
don't understand you!—Come, come, Mrs.
Gerrarde; you and I are old acquaintance,
you know; 'tis no time for dissembling. He
has been a happy man long enough: 'tis
time for a woman of your spirit to be tired
of him; especially as I may think I may
say, without vanity, you do not change for
the worse in falling into my hands. The
lady had now discovered her courage; she
was no longer in fears of being robbed, and
her spirits returned. You audacious crea∣ture!
how dare you treat me thus? Have
you the assurance to insinuate that there
was any thing criminal in my attachment
to Mr. Arnold and his family? My dear
madam, I accuse you of no attachment to
any of his family; he himself was the only
favoured person—Sure there never was such
an impertinent wretch!—But I know the
author of this scandal: it was Mrs.—
(and she dared to profane your sister's
honoured name); but I despise her; and
Mr. Arnold shall soon know how I have
been affronted; and she fell a crying.—My
dear Mrs. Gerrarde, I beg your pardon;
I did not mean to offend you: if Mr. Ar∣nold
admired you, he did no more than
what every man does who sees you. I be∣seech
you to compose yourself; by all that is
good, I mean you no harm; be calm, I con∣jure
you, and don't spoil the prettiest face
in England with crying. A daring, pro∣voking
creature, she sobbed; what could
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
put such an attempt as this in your head?
and to what place are you carrying me?
Only to France, my dear creature: have
you ever been there? To France, to France!
she exclaimed; and do you dare to think
you shall carry me there? Oh! you'll like
it of all things, said I, when you get there.—What
do you think her reply was? Why,
neither more nor less than a good box in
the ear. I catched hold of her hand, and
kissed it: you charming vixen, how I ad∣mire
you for your spirit! She endeavoured
to wrest her hand from me; but I held
them both fast, for fear of another blow.
Base, insolent, ravisher, villain! As she
rose in her epithets, I replied with, lovely,
charming, adorable, tender, gentle creature—She
cried again; but they were spiteful
tears, and did not create in me the least
touch of that pity, which, on any other oc∣casion,
they might have moved me to.</P>
<P>I was glad our altercations had a short
truce, by the chariot's stopping at the gar∣dener's
cottage, where I had ordered my
equipage to wait. All the family were in
bed but the man's wife, who came curt'sy∣ing
to the door. I led, or rather lifted,
Mrs. Gerrarde out of the chariot; for she
would not give me her hand; and begging
she would repose herself for a few minutes,
whilst I gave orders to my servants, put
her into the good woman's hands. She
went sullenly in, without making me any
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
answer: and seeing nobody but the old wo∣man,
she was convinced that complaints,
or an attempt to escape, would be equally
fruitless, and so prudently acquiesced. I
soon dispatched my orders: I made the
footman, who came behind the chariot,
mount the box, and directed him to an inn
in the next village to Mrs. Gerrarde's house,
and from thence to send it home by some
one who did not know to whom it belong∣ed.
I then ordered my own equipage to
the door; and entering the cottage, told
the lady I was ready to attend her. The old
woman presently vanished; so that seeing
nobody to apply to, she suffered me very
quietly to put her into my chariot, and I
placed myself by her. It was made on
purpose for travelling, and I took care to
have nothing but wooden windows; to
which I had the precaution to add a couple
of spring-locks, which shut on drawing up,
and were not without difficulty to be open∣ed.
One of the windows was already up,
and I flurted up the other as soon as I got
into the coach. It was a fine moonlight
morning, the postillion cracked his whip,
and, though the roads were deep and dirty,
the four horses darted away like lightning.</P>
<P>I believe, madam, said I, you are by
this time convinced that my scheme is
too well laid to be baffled by any efforts
you can make. I mean to you treat with due
respect, and beg you will use me with a
<PB N="301" REF="313"/>
little more gentleness than you have done;
that is all the favour I shall ask in return,
'till you yourself are disposed to shew me more.</P>
<P>You are the most amazing creature, said
she, that ever breathed! What is the mean∣ing
that, in the whole course of our acquaint∣ance,
your behaviour never gave me room
to believe that you were serious in your de∣signs
on me, and now at once you souse
upon your prey like a hawk? I'll answer
you in two words, said I. When we first
met, you had a husband; since the renewal
of our acquaintance (you'll pardon me), it
was no secret that you had a favoured lover
in Mr. Arnold: I am not of a temper to
solicit a lady by stealth, and I would
not give a pinch of snuff for the woman
who is not entirely at my disposal. Your
attachments to Arnold forbad this, and I
was determined to have you all to myself.
My attatchments to Mr. Arnold! cried
she, impudently, again. Ay, said I, cool∣ly,
it began to be talked of so openly, that
your reputation was mangled at every tea-table
in the country; and had you staid
much longer there, you would have found
yourself deserted by every female of cha∣racter
that knew you. Mr. Arnold's part∣ing
with his wife, was by every-body charg∣ed
to your account; and as she is reckoned
a very <HI>good sort</HI> of a woman (was not that a
pretty phrase?) every one took her part,
and were not sparing in their invectives
<PB N="312" REF="314"/>
against you. Add to all this that Arnold
has certainly run out of his fortune, and is
so involved that it will not be possible for
him long to make those returns of genero∣sity
which your merit deserves.—You and
I have been acquainted long; I am no stran∣ger
to your circumstances; I know, at
Captain Gerrarde's death, your pension as
his widow, and the very small jointure at
Ashby, was the whole of your income.
Arnold's love, it is apparent, has hitherto
been bountiful; how long it could be in
his power to continue it so, may be a ques∣tion
worth your considering.</P>
<P>I found I had mortified her pride, by
mentioning the narrowness of her circum∣stances,
and the demolition of her character.
If all you say <HI>were</HI> true, Sir, which is far
from being the case, (with a toss of her head,)
you will find it no very easy matter to make
me amends for what I shall perhaps lose for
ever by this violence of yours, notwithstand∣ing
the <HI>smallness</HI> of my income, which you
seem so well informed of. I have a consi∣derable
sum of money, and some valuable
jewels, lying by me, of which my servants
may very probably rob me. I assured her
upon my honour, I would make good to
her every thing she should lose through
my means, and would take care her
situation should never again be upon the
same precarious footing which it had been.
I did not chuse to mention the circumstance
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
of my having secured her maid and her mo∣ney
too; I reserved that for an agreeable sur∣prize.
I had measures to observe; I did not
want to be on good terms with her too soon
for obvious reasons, as nothing was farther
from my heart than a thought of gallantry.</P>
<P>For this purpose, I assumed a more dist∣ant
behaviour, and affected to shew her
something like respect. I did not drop the
least hint of my knowing that Mr. Arnold
had made his lady uneasy on my account,
much less that I suspected her for the wick∣ed
contriver of that mischief. I deferred
the discussing of this point 'till a more favou∣rable
opportunity should offer, when it would
be in my power to make a better use of it.</P>
<P>My design was by degrees to make her
satisfied enough with her situation, not to
wish to return to Arnold. When I had
once brought her to this, I judged it would
not be difficult to carry her still farther, to
the point was aimed at; and that I, to write
a letter to him of my dictating. You will
think this was a strange expectation, and
yet it was what I resolved to accomplish.
I knew the turn of the mind I had to deal
with: bring a woman of this sort into good-humour,
and it is easy to wheedle her in∣to
compliance. She has no solid understand∣ing;
but possesses, in the place of it, a sort
of flashy wit, that imposes on common
hearers, and makes her pass for what is
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
called clever. With a great deal of vanity,
and an affectation of tenderness, which co∣vers
the most termagant spirit that ever ani∣mated
a female breast, her ruling and go∣verning
passion is avarice; and yet, strange
to tell! generosity is of all things what she
professes to admire, and is most studious of
having thought her characteristic. Her pre∣tensions
to this virtue I have opposed to her
vice of avarice, as the terms appropriated
to each seem most contrary in their natures;
yet I do not mean by generosity, that boun∣teous
disposition which is commonly under∣stood
by the word: no, no; she aimed at
the reputation of this virtue in our more
exalted idea of it, and would fain be thought
a woman of a <HI>great soul.</HI> This phrase was
often in her mouth; and though her whole
conduct gave the lye to her professions, she
would tell you fifty stories, without a word
of truth in any of them, to prove how
nobly she had acted on such and such
occasions. On the knowledge of this part
of her temper, I chiefly built my hopes of
success.</P>
<P>I kept up a sort of forced conversation
during the rest of our journey. She was
sullen, but not rude. As I was far from
desiring to come to an eclaircissement with
her, I did not wish to have her in better
temper.</P>
<P>We reached the inn, which was about a
<PB N="315" REF="317"/>
mile on our side Rochester, at eight o'clock
in the morning. This was a favourable hour,
as by that time every traveller must have left
the stages they lay at. The house stood
alone, and luckily enough had no company
in it. My old servant, Lamb, had receive∣ed
my instructions by letter, and was pre∣pared
accordingly for our reception. This
was the place to which I had ordered
the maid to be carried; she had arrived there
some time before us, and was safely lodged.</P>
<P>The chariot drove into the court-yard
close to the door of the inn; the step was
let down in an instant, and Mrs. Lamb
appeared to receive us. We both darted
into the house. Dressed as we were for a ball,
we made an odd appearance as travellers at
that hour in the morning. I believe this con∣sideration
made Mrs. Gerrarde very readily
hurry up stairs with the woman of the house.</P>
<P>I enquired for Mrs. Gerrarde's maid, have∣ing
given orders to Lamb that she should
not be seen 'till I first spoke to her. I was
carried into the room where she was: she
seemed very glad that we were arrived. I
desired her to lay out her lady's toilet, which
I concluded she had brought with her; for
that Mrs. Gerrarde would presently put her∣self
in a proper habit for travelling. The
maid told me she had brought her mistress's
riding-dress with her, and as many other
things of her wearing apparel as she could
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
conveniently carry. I saw a vast heap of
things lying unpacked on a bed which was
in the room, and asked her how she had
managed so cleverly as to get such a number
of things together without observation. She
told me she had lost no time, from the mi∣nute
I left her, 'till the arrival of her guide;
but had employed the interval in carrying
out some of the best of her lady's cloaths
piece by piece, and conveying them to the
cottage, which she could easily do without
the servants seeing her; for as it was dark,
she passed in and out without observation.
Here she huddled them into a large port∣manteau.
After this she went to examine
her lady's escrutore; but was a long time
puzzled in endeavouring to open it, as none
of the keys I had given her answered. She
endeavoured to force it open with as little
noise as possible, but in vain. She then had
recourse to a second trial of the keys, when
one of them, which probably had been pass∣ed
by before, luckily opened the lock; and
she secured all the money and jewels she
could find. These, said she, kept me in
continual dread all the way as I travelled;
for I have eight hundred pounds in bank
notes; and though my lady has such a quan∣tity
of jewels on her, I am sure I have as ma∣ny
more about me, which I have hid in differ∣ent
parts of my cloaths.</P>
<P>I commended the girl's diligence, as in∣deed
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
it deserved; and having before order∣ed
tea and coffee into Mrs. Gerrarde's room,
I now went in to breakfast with her. I found
the woman of the house still with her, at
which I was not at all uneasy; for as she had
been tutored by her husband, I knew she was
not to be wrought upon, if Mrs. Gerrarde had
attempted it.</P>
<P>As I did not at that time desire a <HI>tête à tête</HI>
with her, I contrived to keep Mrs. Lamb in
the room, by desiring her to drink tea with us.</P>
<P>When we had done breakfast, I told Mrs.
Gerrarde, that as I feared she was a good
deal fatigued, if it was agreeable to her, we
would remain where we were for that day;
and that I would by all means have her think
of taking some rest. She said she was ex∣tremely
tired, and should like to get a little
sleep. I think, madam, you had better go
to bed, said Mrs. Lamb; I have a very qui∣et
chamber ready, where no noise in the
house can disturb you. Shew me to it, an∣swered
Mrs. Gerrarde, with a tone of wea∣riness
and ill-humour. The woman obeyed;
I followed: she carried her to the door of
the room where the maid was and throwing
it open, Mrs. Gerrarde, who supposed she was
attending her, went in: I stepped in after her;
Mrs. Lamb withdrew.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde's astonishment at the sight
of her maid, is past description. Rachael!
in a tone of admiration. Rachael, who did
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
not think there was any thing unexpected or
extraordinary in their meeting, quite at a loss
to guess at what her mistress wondered, an∣swered
in her turn with some surprize, Ma∣dam!
and waited, expecting she would give
her some orders; which finding the lady did
not, the maid asked her very composedly,
would she please to undress? I hope, ma∣dam,
said I, stepping forward, that Mrs.
Rachael has taken care to bring you every
thing you may have occasion for; I shall leave
you in her hands, and wish you a good re∣pose.
Strange, astonishing creature! said
Mrs. Gerrarde, looking at me with less anger
than surprize. <HI>I</HI> bowed, and left the room.</P>
<P>I ordered Mrs. Lamb to have an eye to
my prisoners; and heartily tired as I was,
between dancing and travelling, I undressed,
and threw myself into bed. I slept 'till six
o'clock in the evening; then rose, and put
myself into a habit fitter for my journey than
that in which I came; and which I had sent
in a post-trunk before me, by the messenger
whom I had employed to apprize Lamb
of my coming.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde was not yet stirring. I
called for Rachael, and asked her how she
had come off with her lady, upon telling
her the manner of her falling into my snare.
Rachael told me her lady wondered mightily
at my art, and said I was the <HI>strangest gen∣tleman</HI>
that ever was born. My friend Ra∣chael
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
softened the expression I fancy; I am
sure Mrs. Gerrarde did not call me a strange
<HI>gentleman.</HI> She said her mistress smiled two
or three times at her relation, particularly at
my giving her the keys. I found, upon the
whole, that my conduct in securing her her
money and her jewels, together with the at∣tendance
of her maid, had a good deal ap∣peased
her resentment.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde did not rise 'till near eight
o'clock. I had ordered as elegant a dinner
as the house could afford; and the lady have∣ing
put herself into a genteel dishabille, with
great alacrity sat down to table, and did not
appear to have fretted away her appetite.
I would suffer no one to attend but Racheal.
I told Mrs. Gerrarde that I proposed setting
out for Dover that night, and that as it
could not be supposed her maid should
be able to ride so far, and that a second
carriage with four horses (as less might not
be able to keep pace with us) would be lia∣ble
to observation, I would, if she pleased,
resign my place in the chariot to Mrs. Ra∣chael,
and attend her myself on horseback.
She answered me coldly, Since she <HI>must</HI> go,
it was indifferent to her who was to be her
companion. Though the motive I offered
for this manner of travelling was not without
its weight, yet my true reason was to avoid
being boxed up so long again with Mrs. Ger∣rarde.
My time was not yet come for ex∣planations,
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
and I was afraid of being upon
good terms with her too soon.</P>
<P>The remainder of the evening was spent
by her and her maid in carefully packing up
their baggage, which had been brought in
a confused huddle to the inn. Mrs. Gerrarde
had a convenient trunk bought at Rochester
for the purpose, and assisted herself in laying
them up safely.</P>
<P>She equipped herself in a smart riding∣dress,
and at eleven o'clock, without any
great reluctance, permitted me to put her
and her maid into the chariot. The inn
had no company in it, at least that we saw;
and our host was too discreet to let any of his
servants be in the way. I mounted my horse,
and triumphantly galloped off with my
prize.</P>
<P>We reached Dover early next morning,
and immediately got on board the packet.
The lady by this time appeared so perfectly
serene, that I believe in my soul I should not
have got rid of her, if I had desired her to
have gone back again; but she had assumed
a new air, and affected a fine tender melan∣choly
in her countenance. I guessed at her
thoughts, and found afterwards my conjec∣ture
right. Will you believe me, Sir George,
when I tell you the baggage had formed se∣rious
<HI>honourable</HI> designs upon my person?
Fact, upon my word. I saw it presently
(you know my knack of reading people's
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
minds in their faces), and was not sorry for
the discovery; for though I determined not
on any account to encourage such a wild ex∣pectation,
yet I intended to make a <HI>discreet</HI>
use of it; besides, I knew it would afford
me a handle for keeping a <HI>respectful</HI> dis∣tance.</P>
<P>We landed next evening. She had been
very sick at sea, and continued so much
out of order, that she was put to bed as
soon as we got to the inn. She ordered
her maid not to stir from her; the very
thing I wished; so that I had nothing to do
but to be very troublesome in my enquiries
after her health, and very sorry for her indis∣position.</P>
<P>The next morning however set all to
rights; and after congratulating her on her
recovery, and the revival of her beauty, I
told her I meant to carry her to Boulogne,
whither I had sent Pivet the night before to
take lodgings for us, in a private house
which he knew. I found that neither Mrs.
Gerrarde nor her maid spoke French; a cir∣cumstance
I was very glad of, though the
former bitterly lamented her having <HI>forgot</HI>
it. She made not the least objection to the
travelling from Calais to Boulogne, as she
had done before; her late indisposition gave
me a pretence for insisting on Rachael's at∣tending
her in the chariot.</P>
<P>The lodgings Pivet had taken were very
handsome; our apartments were on the
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
same floor, separated only by a lobby. Mrs.
Rachael had a little bed fitted up for her by
my directions in her lady's dressing-room.
Thus far I had sailed before the wind; but
now came the difficult part of my task. It
was impossible for Mrs. Gerrande to conceive
that any thing, but down-right love for her
person, could have induced me to do what
I had done. I had actually run away with
her, put myself to some hazard, and, what
in her estimation was no small matter, some
expence too. No other motive had appear∣ed
in all my conduct towards her; and tho'
I had not absolutely made love to her, yet
what other construction could my actions
bear? for my words, to say the truth, were
equivocal. She must necessarily have con∣cluded
that I had no other view but a piece
of gallantry with her. Her designs on me
were of a much more serious nature; and
her vanity made her imagine, that, notwith∣standing
my thorough knowledge of her cha∣racter,
her cunning, joined to my passion,
might lead me into her snare.</P>
<P>Now, I had two nice points to consider
of, and two difficulties to surmount. The
first was, not, by any part of my conduct,
to carry the deception so far, as to give
her the least room to hope I could be mad
enough to marry her. This, bad as <HI>she</HI>
is, and extravagant as <HI>I</HI> am, I could not
think of doing, even to gain my favourite
point. The other was, to keep up such
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
an appearance of gallantry towards her as
she must naturally expect, and at the same
time avoid all approaches which usually
forerun the catastrophe of an amour; than
which nothing was more repugnant to my
wishes.</P>
<P>To steer between these two extremes was
the difficult task, particularly the latter; for,
between ourselves, I began to be much more
afraid of her than she was of me. I knew
it would be impossible for me to keep up
the farce long; the sooner it was over the
better; and therefore I determined to enter
on my part directly.</P>
<P>I had been ruminating on my project all
the way as I rode. When we arrived at
Boulogne, I found myself a little out of
order, having caught cold; and as I was
really somewhat feverish, a thought started
into my head, that this illness might aid me
in my design. When we came to our lodg∣ings,
I made my excuses to Mrs. Gerrarde for
not being able to attend her: I told her I
found myself ill, and must be obliged to go
to bed. She said she was <HI>very sorry,</HI> and per∣haps
she spoke truth.</P>
<P>I left her in possession of her new apart∣ment
with her maid Rachael. Their being
strangers to the language of the country cut
off all communication with the people of
the house, who could nor speak English. I
introduced Pivet to them, whom they had
never seen before (for he had taken par∣ticular
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
care to keep out of their view dure∣ing
the whole journey), as a gentleman who
was to be their interpreter; and having thus
settled my houshold, I retired to my bed∣chamber.</P>
<P>Not well, nor sick enough to go to bed,
I threw myself however down on it; and
after revolving in my mind all the occur∣rences
of the three or four past days, I started
up again, sat down to my desk, and have
given you, my Bidulph, a faithful narrative
of my proceedings down to the present pe∣riod
of time, being Nov. 20, eight o'clock
in the evening.</P>
<P>You may soon expect to have the second
part of this my delectable history; ‘Shew∣ing
how Orlando, not being able to pre∣vail,
with all his eloquence, on the as fair
and beautiful, as fierce and inexorable,
Princess Gerrardina, to put the finishing
hand to his adventures and most wonder∣ful
exploits, did, his wrath being moved
thereby, like an ungentle knight, bury
his sword in her snow-white, but savage
and unrelenting breast; whereat, being
stung with remorse, he afterwards kills
himself.’</P>
<P>Would not this be a pretty conclusion of
my adventures? No, no, Sir George, ex∣pect
better things from thy friend. I hope
my knight-errantry will not end so tragical∣ly.
But hasten to make my peace with that
gracious creature your sister: yet why do I
<PB N="325" REF="327"/>
name her and myself in the same sentence?
She cares not for me, thinks not of me, or, if
she does, it is with contempt. I said this
before, and I <HI>must</HI> repeat it again; but tell
her, what I have done was wish a view to pro∣mote
her happiness. Oh! may <HI>she</HI> be happy,
whatever becomes of me. I know the means I
have used will make her angry; but try to
make her forgive the means for the motive's
sake. Tell her as much of this wild story as
you think proper; but do not let her see it
in my wild rambling language; that is only
fit for your own eye.</P>
<P>Your mother, I know, is out of all patience
with me. I am black enough in her opinion al∣ready.
This last action, as far as she has yet
known of it, will dye me ten shades deeper;
but pray put in a word for me there too. I know
she will say, that ‘we are not to return evil for
evil; and that it is not lawful to do evil,
though to bring forth good.’ But put
her in mind that there are such things as
<HI>pious frauds</HI> (though, by-the-bye, I do not
take this of mine to be one of them);
‘that wicked people are to have their arts
opposed <HI>by</HI> arts; and that good people
have not only been permitted, but com∣manded
to execute vengeance on sinners.’
And you may hint at the children of Israel's
being ordered to spoil the Aegyptians, tho'
far be it from me to spoil Mrs. Gerrarde of
any thing she has. This however, and as
many wise sayings as you can collect for the
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
purpose, you may string together; and be
sure you tell her I have hopes of reclaiming
Mrs. Gerrarde from her <HI>evil</HI> courses, and
do not despair of prevailing on her to
go into a nunnery; for Mrs. Gerrarde, you
must know, was bred a Roman Catholic,
though she conformed on marrying Captain
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>Now put all this into decent language, fit
for that very good woman's ears; for <HI>good</HI> I
must call her, notwithstanding she was inex∣orable
to me.</P>
<P>I am fatigued with writing so long a
letter—I feel my disorder increase upon
me; I will be let blood, and hope soon to
give you a good account of my under∣taking.
Mean while, if I am not quite
reprobated, write me a line, directed un∣der
cover to Monsieur Larou, at the Post∣house,
Boulogne. Farewell, my dear Bidulph;
sick or well, I am ever your's,</P>
<P>O. F.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 7.—Was there ever such a
piece of knight errantry? What a mad∣cap
is this! Pray, my dear, are you not
astonished at him? I am sure I am. I had
not an opportunity to finish the copying
of this very long letter, which I began yes∣terday
morning, 'till very late this night.
My poor mother has been so restless, and so
much out of order, these two days, I de∣sired
her leave to read to her Mr. Faulkland's
history (for I can call it by no other name)
as I sat by her bed side. She told me, I
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
might let her know the substance of what he
said, as it would fatigue her too much to at∣tend
to so long an epistle.</P>
<P>You would have smiled, my Cecilia, at
my good parent's amazement, when I told
her Mr. Faulkland's proceedings, and his
reasons for them. She would scarce give
credit to it at first, and I was obliged to re∣peat
several circumstances to her over again.
And so, said she, this was all on <HI>your</HI> ac∣count,
and he had <HI>really</HI> no ill design on
Mrs. Gerrarde. I am glad of this for miss
Burchell's sake, and shall be impatient to tell
her of it. I begged of my mother to wait
a while for the result of Mr. Faulkland's
adventure, before she mentioned any thing
of the matter to miss Burchell. We do
not yet know, said I, how this matter may
turn out; Mr. Faulkland, to be sure, will
make haste to communicate to my brother
the issue of this odd affair, and it will then
be time enough to inform the young lady.</P>
<P>My mother unwillingly consented to post∣pone
a discovery which he knew would be
so agreeable to miss Burchell. I applaud
her humanity; but think that, good and
prudent as she is, she is too unreserved in
her confidences. This strange business is,
I think, at present in too critical a suspence
to trust the knowledge of it to any body.
If Mr. Faulkland fails in his design, his
avowal of it will be far from serving me.
Sir George was with us for a few minutes
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
to-day, only to exult in Mr. Faulkland's
recovered credit. Has he not well explain∣ed
himself, said he? Oh! I knew there must
have been some mystery at the bottom of
that conduct which surprized us all so much.
<HI>There</HI>'s a man for you! Shew me another
who would carry his noble disinterested love
to such lengths!</P>
<P>My mother did not like that he should
run on in that strain, and therefore stopped
him. The end crowns all, Sir George:
let us see how your friend will conduct
himself <HI>through</HI> this ticklish affair. Let
him get through it how he will, answered my
brother a little bluntly, I think Sidney has
obligations to him she ought never to forget.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 16.—More intelligence,
my dear; stranger and stranger still! I am
sorry I sent off my last packet, as I am sure
you must be impatient for the conclusion of
Mr. Faulkland's adventure; and then what
sorry stuff has the interval been filled up with!
but I will now make you amends. My mo∣ther
is better too, thank God! and every thing
promises well.</P>
<P>Sir George has had a second packet from
Boulogne. Take the continuation of Mrs.
Gerrarde's history as follows:</P>
<P>How rude is the hand of sickness, my
Bidulph! it had like to have spoiled one of
the best projects that ever was undertaken,
and consigned to oblivion an action worthy
of immortality. I have been very ill since
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
I last wrote to you; the disorder, which I
then complained of, turned out to be an
ugly fever; and I was for three days in ex∣treme
danger. Mrs. Gerrarde was, during
that time, closely attended by Pivet, whose
services I dispensed with on that account.
He told me she appeared uneasy at my situa∣tion,
and enquired constantly, and <HI>kindly</HI>
too, after my health. When I grew well
enough to sit up, I begged the favour of
seeing her in my chamber. She came very
readily, and seemed downright anxious for
my recovery. I told her I hoped she had
been treated with proper care and respect
during my sickness. She said Mr. Pivet was
a very obliging, good-natured man, and had
endeavoured to make her confinement as easy
to her as possible.</P>
<P>The plan she had formed of turning to
the most lasting advantage the inclination
she supposed I had for her, inclined her to
assume a very different behaviour from what
was natural to her. The weakness of my
condition, while it afforded me a pretence
for a more cold and languid behaviour, than
I could with any colour have put on at another
time, gave her an opportunity of playing off
her arts, and facilitated my design beyond
my hopes.</P>
<P>She was seated at my bed-side: our first
conversation consisted of nothing but com∣plaints
on my side, and condolements on
<PB N="330" REF="332"/>
her's. I signed several times, and she sigh∣ed
in return. Mrs. Gerrarde, said I, you
are afflicted; but my illness has no share in
your concern. Something else oppresses you;
you regret the being separated from Mr.
Arnold, and I am always the object of your
hatred. Neither one nor t'other, answered
she, in a kind voice. 'Tis impossible to
hate you; you know it is not in nature for
a <HI>woman</HI> to hate such a man as Mr. Faulk∣land.
As for Mr. Arnold, though I <HI>own</HI>
my former weakness in regard to him, yet
I hope I have something to plead in
my excuse. I was married very early to an
old man, and had never experienced the
happiness of reciprocal love: he died, and
left me destitute. Mr. Arnold's generous,
though I must confess unwarrantable passion,
rescued me from distress. I did not know
he was married when I first unwarily accepted
of his addresses, and it was too late to retreat
before I found it out; otherwise the universe
should not have tempted me to have listened
to him.</P>
<P>In the midst of the affluence I obtained
from him, it often grieved me to think of
the injury I did his wife. There is nothing,
Mr. Faulkland so grating to a generous mind,
and I think I may venture to assert that <HI>mine</HI> is
one, as to live in a state of dependence, and,
at the same time, owe that very dependence
to a vice that you disdain.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="333"/>
I was delighted to find that she had got
into this strain; it was the thing I wished,
but durst hardly hope for without abundance
of trouble on my part, and a dissimulation
that was irksome to me. I knew she had
studied this speech, and got it by rote to an∣swer
her own purpose; but in this, as is ge∣nerally
the case of designing people, she
overshot herself, and became the dupe to
her own artifice. I laid hold of the cue she
gave: Oh! madam, you charm me! go
on, go on; now indeed you shew a generous
mind: happy would it be for all your sex,
after having deviated from the paths of vir∣tue,
if they could return to them with so
good a grace, so just a sense of their errors!
To <HI>you,</HI> Sir, said she, with a solemn air, I
am indebted for my present resolutions: I
hope from this time forward that my life
will be irreproachable. <HI>I</HI> hope so too, ma∣dam.
I guessed she understood these words
as favouring her design: it was not meet to
undeceive her (a little mental reservation,
you know, Bidulph): she went on, little
thinking she was forwarding <HI>my</HI> plan, when
she only meant to promote her <HI>own.</HI> I hope
Mr. Arnold will be as sensible of <HI>his</HI> fault
as I am of <HI>mine,</HI> and that he will never fall
into the like indiscretion again. I believe
there can be no true happiness but between
a <HI>married</HI> pair, who sincerely love each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="334"/>
Good! good! thought I; sure my better
genius prompts the woman to speak thus.
Ah! Mrs. Gerrarde, how exactly do your
thoughts correspond with mine! How just
are all your sentiments! What a true relish
have you for virtue! Yes, I hope with you
that Mr. Arnold will be able to tread in your
steps: it is a pity he has not your noble
example before him. Mrs. Arnold is a good
woman, and he might still live with her in
tolerable contentment, if he can get the
better of his irregular passion for you. What
a noble triumph of virtuous resolution would
this be, if you yourself were the instrument
to bring this about. For Mrs. Arnold's and
her brother's sake, as well as your own, I
wish this were feasible.</P>
<P>I would do any thing in my power, said
she (thinking she obliged me by the decla∣ration);
but I know not by what means such
an event can be brought to pass.</P>
<P>I was afraid to urge the matter farther: I
was within an hair's breadth of gaining my
point, but did not think it prudent to press
too forward. We'll think of it another
time, said I, and groaned heavily, as if my
spirits were fatigued with talking. She took
the hint. I am afraid I have tired you; you
have talked too much. I answered her
faintly, You are very good! She curtesied
to me, and retired with a majestic step. I
saw her no more that day: she had got upon
<PB N="333" REF="335"/>
stilts, and it was not yet time to take her
down. To-morrow may produce a wonder:
I will wait for it. I am really weak, but be∣gin
to recover my spirits.</P>
<P>Boulogne, Dec. 6.</P>
<P>Nothing is so conducive to the body's
health, as the mind's being at ease. I have
proved the truth of this observation: my
soul had been racked with suspence and un∣certainty
during my illness; the uneasy state
of my mind increased my disorder; the
disorder itself had chiefly given rise to my
apprehensions, as pain and sickness are na∣turally
accompanied with a gloominess of
thought. Thus the cause and its effects were
united in mutual league against me, and re∣ciprocally
assisted each other to plague and
torment me.</P>
<P>My fears were entirely on Mrs. Arnold's
account. What, thought I, would be the
consequence of my project, in case of my
death? Mrs. Gerrarde will return back to
England; and, upon telling her story, will
be received again by Arnold; their union
perhaps established as firmly as before, and
poor Mrs. Arnold's hopes ruined for ever.
Then I thought what a wretch I must appear
in her eyes, doubtful, may be, of my sin∣cerity
as to the motives I urged to you for
my conduct. On the other hand, if these
motives should by any means happen to be
suspected by Mrs. Gerrarde, it might be the
<PB N="334" REF="336"/>
means of producing the direct contrary ef∣fect
from what I intended; and instead of
banishing Arnold's cruel suspicions of his
lady, only serve to strengthen them; for I
knew Mrs. Gerrarde would leave nothing
unsaid or undone for this horrid purpose;
and it is not every one, Sir George, whose
hearts are enlarged enough to suppose a man
may now and then take a little pains from
disinterested principles. This last suggestion
of my thoughts made me almost mad, and
actually brought on a delirium; and what
may seem a paradox, though it is literally
true, the total deprivation of my senses for
two days was the means of my recovering
them afterwards; for I am sure, had I re∣tained
enough of them to have ruminated
longer on this fatal supposition, and my
disorder had still threatened me with death,
I should have run mad. The care of a skil∣ful
physician recalled me from the precincts
of the grave; the strength of a constitution,
naturally good, joined to all the resolution I
could muster, did the rest.</P>
<P>The first use I made of my recovered rea∣son,
was to consult with myself in what
manner, or by what means, I should prevail
on Mrs. Gerrarde to lend a helping hand to
my design. Her leaving Arnold to go off with
me, and to all human appearance with her
own consent, was a material point gained; but
the most important of all, and without which
<PB N="335" REF="337"/>
every thing else would be fruitless, was to
get her to acknowledge, under her own
hand, the injury she had done Mrs. Arnold
by her vile insinuations to her husband. This
was the grand object of all my wishes. This,
you will say, was difficult: I confess it did
then appear so to me. I had not at first
weighed all the consequences of my enter∣prize
with that deliberation that I ought.
The principal object I had in view, was the
separating Mrs. Gerrarde and Mr. Arnold,
and raising his indignation against her, on
account of the apparent infidelity on her
side. To say the truth, I had not consider∣ed
what I was to do with her when I had her.
Two things I had resolved on; the one was,
not to let her return to England; the other,
to provide for her in whatever way she
would put it in my power (the devoting
myself to her excepted), in such a man∣ner
as should leave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her no room to re∣proach
me with having injured her temporal
welfare.</P>
<P>During my illness, I had revolved all
these things in my mind; the last, viz. the
providing for Mrs. Gerrarde, was not a
matter in which I expected to meet many
difficulties; the other appeared very formi∣dable.
Several methods presented them∣selves,
but none of them pleased me, and
I rejected them one after the other; and,
to tell you my mind honestly, I was almost
<PB N="336" REF="338"/>
resolved on using compulsion, and frighten∣ing
the poor woman into compliance; for I
preferred even this to artificial dealings. I
had already used more than I could have
possibly brought myself to on any other oc∣casion
in the world; and I think I should
have threatened her with a nunnery, the
bastile, or even an inquisition, sooner than
have failed, if she herself had not beyond
expectation, beyond hope, almost beyond
the evidence of my senses, led me as it were
to request the thing of her, which of all
others I most despaired of her consenting to,
or even hearing proposed with patience.
And yet, notwithstanding the seeming
strangeness of this, it was nothing but what
was very natural, and most consonant to her
own designs. Blinded, and, as I may say,
infatuated by vanity, she imagined, that as
I had taken such uncommon pains to obtain
her, I must love her with an uncommon
degree of passion; and that her steadily
refusing any dishonourable proposals might
induce me, rather than lose her, to make her
my wife.</P>
<P>In order to prepare me the better for this,
no means were more natural, than for her
to assume the air of a penitent, to seem
sorry and ashamed of her past sins, and re∣solve
on a virtuous course for the future. At
the worst, that is, if she found <HI>I</HI> was not
disposed to be as virtuous as herself, she
<PB N="337" REF="339"/>
knew she might play an after-game; and
could easily relax by degrees from the se∣verity
of her chastity, accordingly as I
made it worth her while.</P>
<P>This was the master-key to her behaviour,
and once I had got it, which I soon did, it
was easy to unlock her breast.</P>
<P>She came into my room the next morn∣ing
without an invitation, and only the pre∣vious
ceremony of sending Rachael to en∣quire
how I did, and to tell me, if I were
well enough to <HI>rise</HI> (observe her nicety), she
would sit half an hour with me. I had en∣joyed
such tranquility of heart since my last
conference with her, and had rested so well
the preceding night, that I found myself
quite another thing from what I was the day
before; and, excepting a little weakness, I
was as well as ever I was in my life. I was up
and dressed, and you may be sure sent a
suitable answer to her kind message, which
soon brought the lady, sailing with an im∣perial
port, into my chamber. After some
civilities past on both sides, she, by way of
bringing her own interests on the tapis, re∣assumed
the topic of our yesterday's con∣versation.</P>
<P>You don't imagine Mr. Faulkland, said
she, how easy I am in my mind, since I
have reconciled myself to the loss of Mr.
Arnold. I own I had a regard for him;
but I think it had more of gratitude than
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
love in it; for though he is an agreeable
man, to say the truth, he never was quite
to my taste: he had always something too
formal about him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty to ask her, how she
first came acquainted with Mr. Arnold;
and, as you may not know it, I will give you
the story. She answered, with a profound
sigh, It was by mere accident I first saw
him. After the death of Captain Gerrarde,
which happened in a little more than a year
after we left Bath, for the gout, poor man,
got into his stomach not long after we re∣turned
home (and the crocodile pretended
to drop a tear), I went to London, in or∣der
to sollicit for my pension. As I had
formerly been a Roman Catholic, and had
not publickly renounced that persuasion, some
difficulties arose in the business; and a friend
of my deceased husband, who had under∣taken
the affair for me, happening to be
an intimate of Mr. Arnold's, and knowing
he had an influence with the secretary at war,
endeavoured to interest him in my favour,
by representing my situation in the most af∣fecting
light he could to him. He kindly
undertook to interfere for me, and was as
good as his word; but could not surmount
the difficulty of the objection which was
made to my claim. He happened one
morning, unluckily for me, to call in
at my friend's lodgings, to tell him of
<PB N="339" REF="341"/>
his ill success: I, impatient to know how
my affair went on, had dropped in to en∣quire
about it a few minutes before him,
and was sitting in the dining-room when
Mr. Arnold entered. I was in my weeds,
and my melancholy looks, I believe, made
Mr. Arnold conjecture I was the person for
whom he had so kindly concerned himself.
He told my friend he was sorry to inform
him, that though he had used all means in
his power, with regard to the affair in which
he had employed him, he found it was im∣possible
to effect the business; and I am the
more concerned, said he, turning towards me,
as I am afraid this lady is to be the sufferer.
My relation said I was the person for whom
he had been so good as to intercede. I re∣turned
Mr. Arnold thanks not without
tears at the uncomfortable prospect I had
before me; for I had then nothing to depend
on but my small jointure in Kent. I was
about to take my leave; but observing it
rained, desired my friend to give his servant
leave to call me a chair. Mr. Arnold very
politely desired I would permit him to set
me down, as his chariot waited at the door.
I would have excused myself; but my
relation said, 'Tis in his way, child; and
since you have no hopes of a pension, you
ought to be sparing of chair-hire. Mr.
Arnold very obligingly offered me his hand,
and led me to his chariot. He set me down
<PB N="340" REF="342"/>
at my lodgings, and at parting desired per∣mission
to wait on me. The fatal conse∣quence
of our acquaintance it was impos∣sible
for me to foresee; for I never had the
least hint given me, either from my own
relation or Mr. Arnold himself, that he was
a married man, 'till he had so far secured my
gratitude, by repeated acts of generosity,
that it was impossible for me to refuse him
the return he demanded.</P>
<P>Too-grateful heart, said I (pretending to
believe her cant,) what a pity thou wert not
destined to reward a purer love! But I thought,
madam, you really had enjoyed a pension.</P>
<P>It was not necessary, she answered, that I
should let the world suppose otherwise. I was
not at all known when I first came to town.
Mr. Arnold's excessive profuseness (quite
against my inclination), threw me into a
more expensive way of living than before.
I found myself obliged to account for it,
to the few acquaintance I had, by all the
probable means I could devise. For this
purpose, I pretended that I had not only
obtained a pension, but had also a fortune
left me by the death of a relation. This was
believed, as no-body troubled their heads to
enquire whether it was true or not.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold was passionately fond of the
country, and always passed his summers
there; but as he could not think of parting
<PB N="341" REF="343"/>
with me, he was sadly at a loss how to have
me near him, without bringing on us both
the observation of an inquisitive neghbour∣hood
(such as all country places abound in)
if I went down, quite a stranger as I was,
into Essex; particularly as he told me there
were two families near Arnold-abbey, who
made it their business to pry into other peo∣ple's
affairs. These were, a Lady Grimston, a
censorious old woman, and the parson of the
parish, who was a mighty strict man, of
whom Mr. Arnold seemed to stand in some
awe. He therefore determined against my
going into that part of the world: but hav∣ing
casually heard me speak of my little cot∣tage
in Kent, where poor Captain Gerrarde
and I had lived for two or three years, he
asked me whereabouts it was, and was delight∣ed
to find it joined his own estate at South-Park,
and was within a mile of his house.
He begged of me to go down to my own
house, which he insisted on furnishing ele∣gantly
for me, and obliged me also to keep
a chariot. I (tho' unwillingly) found myself
under a necessity of complying. About a
fortnight after I was settled at Ashby, Mr.
Arnold and his family came down: then it
was, for the first time, I saw his lady.
I went to pay my compliments to her, as eve∣ry
genteel family in the neighbourhood did;
and I own I never saw her without seeling
myself shocked to death at the thoughts of
<PB N="342" REF="344"/>
the injury I did her; for I really believe
Mrs. Arnold is a very well meaning woman.</P>
<P>Oh! thou scorpion, muttered I to myself,
and yet thou hast pursued her to affliction
and ruin!</P>
<P>That Mrs. Arnold is a well-meaning wo∣man,
said I coldly, I have no doubt; yet
you see Mr. Arnold's opinion of her virtue
was not strong enough to be proof against
suspicions; for it is most certain, that if he
had not given credit to your representations of
his wife's conduct, he would not have gone
such lengths as to have parted with her, for Ar∣nold:
had always some regard to appearances.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> representations, Sir! with a look of
astonishment; pray do not lay more to my
charge than I deserve: what the particular
reasons were, which induced Mr. Arnold to
part with his wife, I will not say; but what∣ever
his suspicions were, they never took
their rise from me.</P>
<P>I found she intended to brazen this denial
out; but as it was absolutely necessary to
my design to bring her to a confession of
this particular act of persidy, I resolved to
lead her into it in such a way as should be
least mortifying to her pride.</P>
<P>Come, come, my dear Mrs. Gerrarde,
said I, I know you are above concealing any
past failings that you are resolved to mend.
I know very well that it was <HI>your</HI> insinuati∣ons,
and your's only, that kindled the fire of
<PB N="343" REF="345"/>
jealousy in Arnold's breast. Such arts are not
uncommon in lovers. You loved him then,
and wished to have him entirely to yourself;
and a wife, though a forsaken one, is still
intitled to so much attention from her hus∣band,
as a fond mistress may think robs her
of too much. I know this was the case,
and it is natural: but were you not on unmer∣ciful
little tyrant to involve <HI>me</HI> in the mis∣chief,
and put it into the man's noddle,
that <HI>I</HI> had designs upon his wife?</P>
<P>The easy manner in which I affected to
speak of this affair, seemed to reconcile her
a little to the charge; but the last part of it,
which regarded myself, struck her all of a
heap. She had no notion that I knew it.
She was going to speak, to deny the accusa∣tion,
I suppose, and therefore I prevented her;
and taking her by the hand, Come now,
said I, deal with me ingenuously; and if
you would persuade me that you are really
in earnest, and mean to repair those little
lapses which you have inconsiderately been
led into, tell me truly, did you really believe
that I ever had any thoughts of an amour
with Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>I chose to give my enquiry this turn, that
she might, with less shame to herself, by
laying hold on the hint, acknowledge her
guilt. She hesitated for an answer, and I
guessed she was considering whether to per∣sist
in denying the whole charge against her,
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
or avail herself of the handle I had given
her, and make a sort of merit of her sincerity,
by pretending to believe what she was
thoroughly convinced there was not the least
foundation even to suspect, but what her
own wicked suggestions had encouraged in
the unfortunate Arnold. Her silence, thus
rightly interpreted by me, made me go on:
You see I know all your secrets; and you are
not the woman I take you for, if you con∣ceal
your real sentiments in this particular:
more of my quiet depends on it than you
are aware of, and I withdrew my hand from
her's with a serious and almost resenting air.</P>
<P>She appeared disturbed, and in a good
deal of confusion; but recovering herself,
Why really, Mr. Faulkland, I can't say but
I <HI>had</HI> some suspicion of what you mention.
I was no stranger to your fondness for Mrs.
Arnold before she was married, and there
was nothing very surprising in a disappointed
lover's renewing his hopes, when he thought
the neglect which a lady met with from her
husband, might incline her to be less obdurate
to a man she was once known to favour so much.</P>
<P>This was enough: I did not think it by
any means necessary to press her to a farther
explanation; what she said was a sufficient
acknowledgement of her fault, though the
cunning forceress had turned the hint (which
I had indeed thrown out on purpose) to her
own advantage: and had the effrontery to
<PB N="345" REF="347"/>
avow an opinion which had never before
entered into her imagination.</P>
<P>I found it necessary now to carry on the
farce, by assuring her, I had never enter∣tained
a thought to Mrs. Arnold's disho∣nour;
and that though I made no great
scruple of robbing a man of his mistress,
yet I thought it a crime of the blackest dye
to deprive him of the affection or fidelity
of his wife.</P>
<P>The serious manner in which I spoke this,
a little disconcerted Mrs. Gerrarde. Well
said she, I can only say, that I am very sorry I
entertained so false a suspicion; and more so, as
it has produced such unhappy consequences:
but I hope Mr. Faulkland will not believe
that I meant <HI>him</HI> any injury.</P>
<P>That I am sure you did not, said I; and yet
this very affair has given me more uneasiness
than you can imagine; for as Mrs. Arnold's
brother is my most particular friend, he
must think me the greatest of villains, if
I could entertain a thought of dishonouring
his family: the fear of losing his friendship,
I own, gives me more pain than I can ex∣press,
and there is nothing I would not do
to exculpate myself to him.</P>
<P>I am very unfortunate, cried Mrs. Ger∣rarde
(pretending to wipe her eyes), to have
been the occasion of so much uneasiness in any∣body's
family. I wish I had died before I
was so unhappy as to meet with Mr. Ar∣nold,
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
if it had not been for him, I might
now have been an innocent and a contented
woman; and she <HI>really</HI> squeezed out a tear,
though not of contrition.</P>
<P>Dear madam (again taking her hand), do
not afflict yourself for what is past recalling;
contentment, nay happiness, I hope, is
yet within your reach; it will be your own
fault if you do not lay hold of it: as for
the unhappy family that <HI>I,</HI> as well as <HI>you,</HI>
have contributed to distress, I wish from my
heart there could be a re-union amongst
them. Mr. Arnold's having lost you
might perhaps incline him to turn his
thoughts towards his wife, if he were not
prejudiced against her by the suspicions he has
entertained of her virtue. This I am afraid
will be an insuperable bar to their ever living
together, unless your influence, which first
gave birth to his jealousy, is still forcible
enough to remove it.</P>
<P>I wish it were in my power, said Mrs.
Gerrarde; there is nothing I would not do
to effect it: but what influence can I have
on Mr. Arnold, after what has happened?</P>
<P>Suppose you were to write to him, said I:
you and he probably may never meet again;
and it would be an effort worthy indeed of a
noble mind, to repair the wrongs we have
done to others, by a candid acknowledge∣ment
of our own faults. Putting Mrs. Ar∣nold
out of the question, 'tis a reparation
<PB N="347" REF="349"/>
you owe <HI>my</HI> character; for however light
the world may make of a piece of gallantry
with a married woman, it is a matter of se∣rious
moment to me to acquit myself of the
supposed crime to Sir George Bidulph.</P>
<P>If you think, said she, that my writing to
Mr. Arnold could produce such good effects,
I am ready to do it; though I confess I
hardly know how to address him; for he
must, to be sure, look upon me as the very
reverse of what I <HI>really</HI> am, and thinks me
without dispute an ungrateful woman.</P>
<P>We can but try, said I: if it does not
produce the desired effect, it will not be your
fault; and you will have the satisfaction to
reflect that you have done your duty. I
stepped to my escrutoire while I was speak∣ing;
and resolving not to give her time to
cool, took out pen, ink, and paper, and
laid them on a little writing-table before her.
If this unlucky breach, said I, were once
made up, my mind would then be easy.</P>
<P>She took the pen in her hand, but seemed
irresolute, and at a loss how to begin. Come,
madam, said I, and confute by your own
example, the received erroneous opinion,
that if a woman once strays from the paths
of virtue, she never returns to them.</P>
<P>A false and ill grounded opinion indeed,
said she, listing up her profane eyes as in
penitence. What am I to say?</P>
<P>[You are to observe, that my notes, as
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
she went along while I dictated, are put be∣tween
hooks.]</P>
<P>[Begin] ‘Dear Sir’ [for I would be nei∣ther
too familiar nor too cold], “The terms
on which you and I have lived, intitle you
to an explanation of my reasons for leaving
you so abruptly; and I hope the generosity
of my motive, will incline you to over∣look
the seeming unkindness of the action.”
[This you may assure yourself it will, when
he comes to consider coolly]. “The unhap∣piness
that I occasioned in your family, by
causing the separation of you and your
wife, has, for a long time, been a thorn in
my heart; and the more so, as besides the
robbing her of your affections, I own,
and take shame to myself in the confession”
[how noble must he think this confession!],
“that those aspersions, which I threw on her,
had not the least foundation in truth.”
[This is truly great]. “I always believed
her perfectly innocent; but if I could have
had the least possible doubt of it before, I
must be now confirmed in that opinion by
Mr. Faulkland, who can have no reason
for excusing or concealing facts of this na∣ture
from me at present”. [Here she add∣ed
of herself, repeating it first aloud to to
me.] “and I think the preference he has
given me to her, now in her state of se∣paration,
is a convincing proof of this.”
[An admirable argument] (her vanity would
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
not let her slip this observation). [Pro∣ceed
madam]. ‘The true reasons of my
insinuations against her, were no other than
that I could not bear to share your affecti∣ons
with any-body” [and a very sufficient
reason too, which a man that loves can easily
forgive]. “I knew, that so long as she gave
you no cause of complaint, you were too
just to withdraw your whole heart from
her, and nothing <HI>but</HI> the whole would con∣tent
me.” [Still you see you shew a great
mind]. True, said she, going on; but my
reason for leaving him without apprizing him
of it, what are we to say for that? [Oh! no∣thing
more <HI>easy</HI> to execute: he will admire
you the more for the reason <HI>I</HI> shall give.
Come]. ‘My departing without first make∣ing
you acquainted with my design, and
going off with another person, may, at
first sight, seem very strange; but, to tell
you the real state of my heart, I found I
could not trust to its firmness on the sub∣ject
of parting with you. I loved you so,
that it was with pain and grief I made the
resolution; and I knew too well, that had
you used any arguments, which to be sure
you would have done, to dissuade me, I,
like an easy fool, would have given up all
my good designs.’ [I am only afraid this
will make him love you more than ever.]
(She smiled as she continued to write.) “As
for the other article”—(This I was more
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
puzzled to excuse than the first; but put∣ting
on a bold face, I said, madam, I hope
you will not condemn me here, while you
excuse yourself: the saying you were <HI>run
away</HI> with, will knock all the rest on the
head, and he may chuse whether he will be∣lieve
that you really intended to break off
with him or not; therefore that particular had
better not be touched upon. Well, said she,
get me out of this scrape as cleverly as you
brought me into it. Fear not said I; (go
on). “As for the other article, though I
shall never love Mr. Faulkland as I have
done you, yet in him I have found a pro∣tector;
and through his means, I hope to
pass the remainder of my life, in a manner
more suitable to a woman of a generous
way of thinking, than that wherein she
considered herself as encroaching on the
rights of another. I hope, by this sacri∣fice
which I have made of my love to a
more heroic principle, that I shall expiate
my former offence; and that you will fol∣low
my example so far as to make what
reparation you can to the woman we have
both injured.” [How this must raise, how
exalt you in his opinion! I think it must,
cried she, bridling up her head, as if they
were really her own sentiments.]</P>
<P>I believe, said I, this is all that is neces∣sary
to be said: you may add, in a post∣script,
that, as he furnished the house for
<PB N="351" REF="353"/>
you at Ashby, every thing in it is at his ser∣vice;
together with your chariot and horses,
which were also his gifts.</P>
<P>She demurred to this; and in the midst
of her heroics, said, I wish I could get
somebody to fell them for me privately, and
remit the money to me; for, since I <HI>am</HI>
here, I should like to see a little more of
France, before I return.</P>
<P>I told her that would look mean, and be∣low
a <HI>great mind.</HI> Well, said she, let them go.
I owe all my servants a year's wages, and ano∣ther
person about fifty pounds for a little tem∣ple
he had just built in my garden, but not
quite finished when I came away. I think I
had better desire those debts to be discharged:
I have always been very punctual in my deal∣ings,
and would not for the world <HI>wrong</HI>
any-body.</P>
<P>You are in the right, said I: it will look
honourable in you to desire those debts to be
paid.</P>
<P>She now proceeded to conclude her letter
in the same stile she had begun it, and added
a postscript to the purport I mentioned. I
hastened to make her seal it up, and direct it
to Mr. Arnold at his house in London, who,
I suppose, has had the pleasure of receiving it
before now; for I dispatched it off directly.
I flatter myself with the hope that it will
have the desired effect on him.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="354"/>
You will think perhaps, that, as I have
managed it, I have really given her a sort of
merit with him in the acknowedgement of
her fault, and the pretended reason she gives
for leaving him. No such thing, Sir George.
Arnold is a man of too much sense, and
knows the world too well, to be so deceived.
I have been told by my lord V—, who
knows him perfectly, that no-body judges
better when he is not blinded by his passions.
All her professions must go for nothing when
<HI>facts</HI> are against her. It is plain she went
off with another man, and to all appear∣ances
premeditately, as her maid and her
riches bore her company. 'Tis also plain,
by her own confession, that this man stands
well with her. As for her recanting her inju∣rious
aspersions on poor Mrs. Arnold, 'tis
the only circumstances in her letter likely to
gain belief, as she could have no temptation
to that but real compunction, with which
people of that kind are sometimes visited;
and for the rest of her letter, to any one of
common understanding, that lays circum∣stances
together, it will appear, as I intended
it should, the contrivance of an artful jilt,
who having almost ruined the wretch she has
had in her power, would afterwards make a
<HI>merit</HI> of deserting him; for they must be
hardened reprobates indeed, that would not,
if they could, at least try to palliate their evil
deeds. This is the light I expect Arnold will
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
consider her in. I know he is hurt deeply in
his fortune by this vile harpy. I hope the
remnant may be sufficient to support your ex∣cellent
sister, if not in affluence, at least with
comfort, should she regain her influence
over him, and submit to live with him again.</P>
<P>This I am sure, will be the consequence, if
he is not blind to his own happiness.</P>
<P>I shall be impatient to know how the letter
operates on him; but this you are not likely
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe let into; and perhaps his pride may
make him endeavour to conceal it from eve∣ry-body.
My lord V—, I am sure, will pick
up some intelligence, and send it to me.</P>
<P>I think Mrs. Gerrarde's confession, in re∣gard
to Mrs. Arnold (to which she could have
no interested motive), with the corroborating
circumstance of <HI>my</HI> going off with her at a
time when Mrs. Arnold was from under her
husband's protection, injured by him in the
tenderest point, and aspersed by a barbarous
and invidious world; all this, I say, must
surely clear from all suspicion that admirable
creature: for who, that knows Mrs. Arnold,
would think that any man (except her hus∣band)
would prefer any woman upon earth to
her? If this does not remove all doubt of
her conduct in Arnold, as well as in the rest
of the world, my pains have been to little
purpose; and I know no other human means
that can be used to disabuse the mad cre∣dulity
of that man. I pity him from my
<PB N="354" REF="356"/>
heart in his present situation; for it will be
some time before he will be sensible of the
good I have done him; and I dare swear, the
man is at this time so ungrateful, that, if he
could, he would cut my throat. I do not
want to have him know the extent of his obli∣gation
to me: I shall be satisfied to sit down
in the contemplation of my meritorious
actions, without enjoying the same of them.
This greatness of mind I learnt of Mrs. Ger∣rarde.
But to return:</P>
<P>The having gained my material point
put me into such spirits, that I could have
kissed Mrs. Gerrarde; a liberty which, I as∣sure
you, however I never presumed to take.
She, for her part, seemed as well pleased
with what she had done as I was. I praised
her for the part she had acted, though I
very much feared she would repent of it
when we came to explanations, which I re∣solved
should be on that very day. I told
her, I hoped she would oblige me with her
company at dinner. She consented with a
bow. I had ordered one to be got ready ear∣lier
than usual, and directed that it should be
in her apartment. We were told it was on
table. I never saw Mrs. Gerrarde so agree∣able
as she was during dinner; she was in
high spirits and good humour: I almost
thought it a pity to let her down that day;
but I considered the longer her expectations
were kept up, the greater would be her dis∣appointment;
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
and out of pure charity, I
determined to put her out of doubt.</P>
<P>I had been told Mrs. Gerrarde was no
enemy to a chearful glass; but the designs
she had formed upon me put her on her
guard, and I observed she drank nothing but
wine and water, made very small. This, I
was afraid, would not be sufficient to keep
up her courage under what I intended to
say to her. I pretended to be disposed to
drink, and insisted on her helping me out
with a flask of burgundy. With affected
coyness she suffered me to fill her glass; the
second offer I made, her resistance was less;
the third she made no objection to at all; and
the fourth she filled for herself. The wine
was excellent; not that poor sort which is
commonly drunk in France. In short, we fi∣nished
our bottle. I thought her now a
match for what I had to say. I had made
the glass pass briskly, and had filled up the
intervals with singing catches, and rattling
on any subject that came into my head.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, who no doubt expected I
should make an advance of some kind or
other, seemed to grow a little out of humour
at my levity. I found the burgundy had
been quite thrown away upon her, and had
had very little effect: she was silent for a few
minutes, and seemed to be considering of
something: at last she opened, and I will
<PB N="356" REF="358"/>
give you the conversation that passed between
us, by way of dialogue.</P>
</LETTER>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, it is time that
you and I should understand one another's
meaning a little better than we do at pre∣sent:
you know very well that you have put
an end to all my expectations in England:
indeed, if I were at liberty, I could not have
the face to return there again in any charac∣ter
but that of your wife. (I was glad she
began first, and that, though I guessed at her
views she had used so little caution in disco∣vering
them, as it at once roused in me in∣dignation
which I could not suppress, and
without which I could not have brought my∣self
to mortify her as she deserved).</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>wife,</HI> madam! (stopping her
at that tremendous word) be pleased to tell
me if I heard you right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it was your wife I said:
if you think you and I are to live together
on any other terms, you will find yourself ex∣ceedingly
mistaken. (I smiled and suffered
her to go on). I thought, Sir (stifling the
anger that I saw rising), that the words which
you yourself dictated in the letter which I
just now wrote, where you say, <HI>I had in you
found a protector, and by whose means I should
be able to pass the rest of my life in a manner
more suitable to a woman of a generous way of
thinking, than that wherein she considered her∣self
<PB N="357" REF="359"/>
as incroaching on the rights of another</HI>—
Were not these your own words, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were, madam. (To say the
truth), there was something equivocal in the
paragraph, tho', when I desired her to write
it, this construction never entered into my
head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, how am I to under∣stand
them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest, madam, you have forced
a construction that I never once so much as
dreamed of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Faulkland (with a very
brisk tone), do you fancy that by changing
Mr. Arnold for <HI>you</HI> on any other conditions,
that I am such a mighty gainer by the bar∣gain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, madam, if that <HI>were</HI>
to be the case, I don't think you would be a
very great loser: you have got as much
from poor Arnold as you could expect: I am
able to do better for you; and as I am no∣body's
property, it would certainly, in <HI>that</HI>
respect, be rather a more eligible course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you use me very ill! I did
not expect such treatment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, pray, madam? Did I ever
say I would marry you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but your behaviour
has given me room to suppose that such a
thing was in your thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you not then the more
<PB N="358" REF="360"/>
obliged to me for treating you with such re∣spect
as made you fancy so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Respect! respect (muttering be∣tween
her teeth), Mr. Faulkland! (and she
stood up) there is not a man in England but
yourself, after what I have declared, that
would refuse making me his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have you declared, Mrs.
Gerrarde?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, have I not ingenuously
owned my failings, shewed myself sorry for
them, quitted them, and made all the repa∣ration
in my power?</P>
<P>(I was amazed to see how audaciously she
adopted as her own, the sentiments which I
had suggested to her: it was so like her, that
I could have laughed in her face).</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your behaviour on this occasion,
has really been worthy of the imitation of all
your own sex, and the praise of ours: for a
woman <HI>voluntarily</HI> to quit an irregular life,
and that too from mere motives of <HI>conscience</HI>—
(I was stopped by a knavish sneer, which I
could not subdue. She saw it and fired imme∣diately;
but strutted about the room to cool
herself: at last, for I sat very silent, looking
at her, and playing with one of the glasses)—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, if you are disposed
to have done trifling, and will vouchsafe me
a serious answer, pray tell me, Are you abso∣lutely
determined not to marry me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absolutely.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="359" REF="361"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not serious, sure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear creature, why sure <HI>thou</HI>
canst not be serious in asking me the question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I <HI>am</HI> serious, and expect a
serious answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then,—seriously, I have no
more thoughts of marrying thee, than I have
of marrying the first sultana in the grand
seignior's seraglio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; very well; I am
answered; (and she walked quicker about the
room than before.)</P>
<P>We were both silent. She, I suppose, ex∣pected
that I should propose other terms, and
a settlement; and waited to try if I would
speak. I had a mind to teaze her a little, and
hummed a tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Advancing to me and making a
low curt'sey, with a most scornful and sar∣castical
air). May I presume to enquire what
your mightiness's pleasure is in regard to me?
Do you intend to keep me for your nurse
against your next illness, or intend me for the
grand seignior's palace to wait on the first
sultana?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell (carelesly, and looking
another way). I have not yet determined
which way I shall dispose of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dispose</HI> of me! <HI>dispose</HI> of me!
why sure the man has lost his senses!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Mrs. Gerrarde; we
will play no longer at cross-purposes: sit
<PB N="360" REF="362"/>
down, and be calm for a few minutes, 'till you
hear what I have to say.</P>
<P>(She did so, with a kind of impatience in
her looks, that informed me I might have
made a free proposal, without any great dan∣ger
of her resentment.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long have you and I been
acquainted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! what is that question to
the purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis only in order to my desiring
you would look back, and, upon recollecti∣on
ask yourself, if you ever had any reason
to look upon me as your lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made that observation to you
when we were travelling together: what is
the use of it now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I, in the course of our jour∣ney,
declare myself to be such, or drop the
least hint of devoting myself to you on any
condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not talk on the subject at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ever presume, on the ad∣vantage
of having you in my power, to ven∣ture
on the smallest liberty with you; or ever
deviate from that respect in my behaviour,
that I was used, at all other times, to treat
you with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say you did; and it was
that very behaviour that inclined me to
imagine you had other thuoghts than those
I find you have.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="361" REF="363"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>You drew a wrong conclusion,
though it is to be confessed not a very un∣natural
one. Such a behaviour might have
been so construed by a lady otherwise cir∣cumstanced
than you were; but I think a
woman of your sagacity might have con∣cluded,
that, with Mrs. Gerrarde, a man
would first have tried his fortune upon gen∣tler
terms than those of matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well (peevishly); I do
not understand your riddles: to the point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the point, in short, is this;
that, without any particular designs on your
person, my whole view, in carrying you out
of England, was to break off your inter∣course
with Mr. Arnold.</P>
<P>(She seemed thunder-struck; but reco∣vering
herself, And is <HI>this</HI> what I am to
hear calmly? And she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off the chair
to the other end of the room.</P>
<P>I followed her; and taking her by the
hand, begged she would again sit down, and
hear me out. I drew her to a chair, and
gently set her down in it).</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, for your own sake, hear me
with patience; violence or perverseness will
be of no use to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; I am your pri∣soner;
your <HI>slave</HI> at present: say what you
please; 'tis <HI>your</HI> turn <HI>now.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Madam, as I said be∣fore,
I really never had any designs upon you
<PB N="362" REF="364"/>
merely on your own account. I allow you
to be a very fine woman, and capable of in∣spiring
love in any man that sees you; but I
must tell you plainly, that <HI>love</HI> has had no
share in my conduct. (I saw stifled rage in
her face; but I proceeded). I have already
told you the real motive of my carrying you
off: it was, as I said, to dissolve the union
between you and Mr. Arnold, and my rea∣sons
for wishing to do so are these: Mr.
Arnold is married to one of the best women
living, for whom I have the highest respect
and esteem, and whom I once adored: That
lady has, by your influence over her husband,
not only been thrown out from his heart,
but even thrust out from his house. But
the calamity stops not there; she is cruelly
aspersed by the world through your suggesti∣ons,
and I am the person pointed at for the
injurer of Mr. Arnold's honour, and the de∣stroyer
of his wife's innocence. You have
brought shame and grief into a worthy fami∣ly.
Lady Bidulph (an excellent woman) has
not been able to overcome the shock of the
barbarous treatment her daughter has met
with. Her brother, the beloved friend of
my heart, suffers equal distress; for, though
he is conscious of his sister's innocence, he
feels the wounds that her reputation has re∣ceived;
nor can he possibly redress the mis∣chief,
as his sister's injuries spring from a
cause which her delicacy will not permit to
<PB N="363" REF="365"/>
be scrutinized. Her two poor children are
left without a mother; she herself almost
without a friend and sinking every day under
the weight of such complicated misery. As
for Mr. Arnold himself, I profess no personal
regard for him: I scarce know him; but,
for his family's sake, I would, on any <HI>other</HI>
occasion, risque my life to save him from
ruin; for ruin you have almost brought on
him. I am no stranger to the sums he has
lavished on you; his purchasing an employ∣ment
for <HI>one</HI> of your brothers, and redeem∣ing
another from a prison. You have lost
nothing by my proceedings but what I shall
make up ten-fold to you, if you behave so as
to deserve my kindness. I have now laid
before you the true reason for my conduct.
I hope, that by breaking the inchantment
that tied Mr. Arnold's heart, and blinded his
understanding, he may be induced to do
justice to his injured lady and her family. If
this comes to pass, as I have strong reason
to hope, I have no doubt of the lady's cha∣racter
being retrieved. <HI>Groundless</HI> calum∣nies
generally die of themselves, unless in∣dustriously
kept alive by malice. Mrs. Ar∣nold's
blameless conduct, the friendship her
brother has all along continued to favour me
with, joined to this last apparent proof of my
attachment to you, will, I am certain, in the
eyes of the world, acquit her of all suspicion
of guilt. Your letter to Mr. Arnold will,
<PB N="364" REF="366"/>
as far as relates to your own opinion of her,
give unquestionable evidence of her inno∣cence.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now, Mrs. Gerrarde, lay your hand on
your heart, and answer me if I have not given
you reasons, which, though they may not
be satisfactory to you, are in themselves of
weight sufficient to justify my conduct.</P>
<P>I had watched her countenance narrowly
during my discourse, which she had listened
to without once looking at me. I saw I had
shocked and even confounded her; but I
saw no remorse, no contrition in her looks.
All artifice was now at an end, and she un∣masked
the fiend directly. She started off her
chair with the looks and gestures of a fury;
and fixing her eyes (which had really some∣thing
diabolical in them at that instant)
steadily on me, You wretch! she cried, with
a voice answerable to her looks, you are such
a false dissembling, mean-spirited reptile, that
if you had a kingdom to offer me, and
would lay yourself at my feet to beg my ac∣ceptance
of you, I would trample on you
like dirt! and she stamped on the floor with
the air of an amazon. Do you think you
shally carry on this fine-contrived enterprize?
No, if I perish for it, I will have venge∣ance:
Mr. Arnold shall know how I have
been deceived and betrayed, and I will at
<PB N="365" REF="367"/>
least have the satisfaction of getting your
life, if I lose every thing besides.</P>
<P>A burst of malignant tears now gushed
from her eyes; but she robbed them of their
efficacy, by mixing with them the bitterest
imprecations against me. She curst even
the innocent Mrs. Arnold, you, and the
whole family; and her own folly, in being
blinded by the arts of such a worthless milk∣sop
as myself.</P>
<P>I let her give vent to her passion, calmly
walking about the room all the time; only
now and then casting an eye on her, for
fear she would have rushed on me with a
pen-knife; for I have not the least doubt,
if she had such an instrument about her, she
would have made an attempt that might
have given a very tragical turn to my ad∣ventures.</P>
<P>When she had done sobbing, I addressed
her in a very stern voice; for I found I had
no baby to deal with, and therefore resolved
to frighten her into submission.</P>
<P>I told you before, Madam, that violence
would be of no use to you: your menaces
I laugh at; you are in my power intirely,
and absolutely at my disposal: to think of
getting out of my hands would be vain; for
it is as impracticable as flying. No mortal
knows where you are but the people of this
house, who are strangers to your name and
circumstances; and if they knew both, they
<PB N="366" REF="368"/>
are so totally at my devotion, that it would
not avail you. I shall cut off all possibility
of a correspondence to England. What
then must be your resource? I am prepar∣ed
against all events; and I would carry
you about locked up in an iron cage, like
the Turkish tyrant, till I had subdued that
termagant spirit, sooner than you should
have your liberty to do more mischief. If
you have any regard to your own interest,
you will endeavour to make me your friend:
I have the power and will to serve you; I
have done you no injury; I said I would be
your protector; and so I will, if you will suf∣fer
me to be so. I said I would be the means
of your passing your days in a state more
eligible to a woman of either spirit, discreti∣on,
or a grain of honour, than you have hi∣therto
done. This I am ready to make
good, if you will not be wanting on
your part to your own happiness. You have
acknowledged that you are conscious of your
errors, are sorry for them, and are willing
to quit them (This was turning her own
weapons against herself); if you are in ear∣nest
in this declaration, I will give you the
means of quitting them The money you
have now in your possession, even with the
addition of your little jointure, is not sufficient
to promise you such a support as would make
you easy, if you were to return to England
to-morrow; and your story known (as it
<PB N="367" REF="369"/>
would be), what could you expect? Do you
think Arnold could be so besotted as to re∣ceive
you again? What must be your re∣source?
Why, to continue, while your beau∣ty
lasts, in a wretched, abandoned course.
Ten thousand to one you might never light
on another whose love would be prodigal
enough to enrich you. The only choice
left you, is to stay where you are not known,
and where, if you behave well, you may gain
the respect and esteem which you could ne∣ver
hope for in a place where your history is
known. If you will content yourself with
an easy fortune, joined to a life of virtue and
tranquillity, I will provide you with a hus∣band
that many a woman in your circum∣stances
would bless her stars for: I will dou∣ble
the portion you have already, and get it
settled on you; and will, on certain conditi∣ons,
add a handsome yearly income. If you
do not like this proposal, I have no other al∣ternative
to offer but a nunnery. I know
you were bred a Roman Catholick: I am
sure therefore I shall do no violence to your
religious scruples, if you have any. I can
get you admitted with ease: the religious
here will think it a meritorious act in me,
especially on the terms I shall propose; for I
will make it worth their while to receive and
treat you as a lady of the first family in
France: but remember there is a final period
to all intercourse with this world. If you
<PB N="368" REF="370"/>
think you can bring yourself to submit to
such a life, I would really recommend it to
you; for I am sollicitous for your happiness
both here and hereafter: if not, you have
the other choice to make; and so, Madam, a
husband or a convent; take which you like
best: I give you three days to consider of
it.</P>
<P>I kept up a severe countenance, and a re∣solute
tone. I rang the bell as soon as I had
done speaking. Rachael came in before Mrs.
Gerrarde could answer me. Take care of
your mistress, said I, and left the room, with∣out
even the ceremony of a bow, or deign∣ing
to look at her. I locked the chamber
door, which I took care to clap after me;
and, putting the key in my pocket, left the
lady and her maid to consult at their lei∣sure.</P>
<P>You know, Bidulph, I am not naturally
morose; and that I am not very apt to be
wanting in that complaisance which all wo∣men
expect, and which I really think due to
<HI>almost</HI> all women: but this one had, in the
preceding scene, so intirely thrown off her
sex, that I could hardly consider her as a fe∣male.
I had known many of her ill quali∣ties
before; but those she now discovered, if
they did not shew her more wicked, certain∣ly
rendered her more disgustful to me than
the others. In short, I found that all deco∣rum
was to be laid aside: I had gone too far
<PB N="369" REF="371"/>
not to put the finishing hand to my work;
and I had no other measures to observe, but
to finish, by dint of force, what I had begun
by stratagem. When I mentioned the nun∣nery
to you in a former letter, it was in mere
gaiety of heart: I had no serious thoughts of
that kind, nor did I now propose it as a prac∣ticable
scheme. I knew the woman too well
to suppose she would acquiesce; though, to
confess the truth to you honestly, I think, if
she refuses my other plan of accommodation,
I must compel her to accept of this: nor
ought it to be considered in any other light
than that of confining a wild beast, who,
having already done a great deal of mischief,
would still do more, if left at liberty: but I
think I shall not be driven to this. I believe
she will accept of a husband with a good set∣tlement,
sooner than resign her liberty.</P>
<P>And now who do you think the husband
is whom I have under contemplation for her?
Why, no less a man than my valet de
chambre Monsieur Pivet. He is young and
handsome, of good parts, and a man of birth.
He tells me he has an uncle that is a marquis,
and three or four cousins that are in the high
court of parliament. Without a joke, the
fellow is of a pretty good family: he was
bred a mercer, and in a frolick had run away
from his business, when I picked him up at
Paris, at the time you and I were there toge∣ther.
He then told me, that he only hired
<PB N="370" REF="372"/>
with me for an opportunity of seeing a little
of the world, and that he would one time or
other sit down and settle to his trade. I have
sounded him on the point in hand, and find
him very ready to accept of the lady with all
hers faults.</P>
<P>I told you I had introduced him to Mrs.
Gerrarde, to serve as her interpreter in the
house, at the time I was ill. I did not then
tell her who he was; and both she and her
maid take him for no other than an acquain∣tance
of mine, who happens to lodge in the
same house with us. The vain rogue has en∣couraged
this opinion, and I suppose passes
for a very pretty fellow with them; for you
know Pivet is a Beau, and is really not un∣genteel.
But do not fancy that I intend to
impose him on the lady for any other than
what he really is. All disguise is now laid
aside, and I shall proceed with the utmost
plainness and sincerity, as soon as I know
the lady's mind in regard to her choice.</P>
<P>Here, my dear Sir George, I must take
breath a little: it has been a busy day. I
undertook a difficult voyage without the cer∣tainty
of a landing-place; a few storms I
expected to encounter; I hope I have wea∣thered
the worst, and have come at length
to some prospect of an harbour. I expect
my next greeting to you will be from a fair∣er
shore.—Upon second thoughts, I will
<PB N="371" REF="373"/>
not send this off, till I can put both you and
my self out of the reach of suspence.…</P>
<P>Congratulate me, Sir George, honour me,
as the first of politicians, the greatest of ne∣gotiators!
let no hero of remance compare
himself to me, for first making difficulties,
and then extricating myself out of them; let
no giant pretend to equal me in the manage∣ment
of captive beauties in inchanted castles;
let no necromancer presume to vie with me
in skill for metamorphosing tigresses into
doves, and changing imperious princesses
into plain country nymphs! <HI>All</HI> this have I
brought to pass, without the assistance of en∣chanted
sword or dwarf, in the compass of a
few days; but take the circumstances in the
order they occurred.</P>
<P>I left the lady, as I told you, to utter her
complaints to her confidante. Rachael, a
simple girl, who had just sense enough to re∣gard
her own interest, was not likely to give
her mistress much consolation; for she was
at least as much <HI>my</HI> friend as her's. How <HI>they</HI>
passed the night I know not; for my own
part, I slept in perfect tranquillity. I desir∣ed
Pivet in the morning to go and inquire,
as from himself, how the lady rested. Mrs.
Gerrarde, who was still in bed, no sooner
heard his voice in the outer room, as he was
speaking to her maid, than she called out to
Monsieur Pivet, and desired he would be so
good as to step into her chamber. Pivet, not
<PB N="372" REF="374"/>
much abashed at being admitted to a lady's
<HI>ruèlle,</HI> obeyed her summons, and placed
himself in an armed chair by her. He said
he hoped it was not owing to illness that he
saw her in bed. Yes, Sir, said she, I am
exceedingly ill: I have not slept the whole
night, and am now in a high fever. Has Mr.
Faulkland told you any thing in relation to
me? I had prepared Pivet, and he had his
answers ready. Madam, said, he, I am not
a stranger to your situation, and am exceed∣ingly
sorry for it: I wish the little influence
<HI>I</HI> have over Mr. Faulkland could be em∣ployed
for your service; but he is a positive
man, very enterprising, and not to be con∣trolled
by any-body. Do you know my sto∣ry,
Sir, cried Mrs. Gerrarde? He bowed,
and looked down. Mrs. Gerrarde under∣standing
this as an affirmative, and raising
herself up a little, cried out, A base, unge∣nerous
man! Does he intend to expose me
wherever he goes? By no means, Madam,
answered Pivet: There is nothing in your
story that would do you the least injury in
any-body's opinion here: the ladies in France
do not think it any disgrace to have lovers.</P>
<P>You are very obliging, Sir, she replied;
and perhaps I have as much to say in my
vindication as any woman: but sure never
was mortal used in the barbarous manner I
am. Do you know the proposal he had the
insolence to make me last night? Either to
<PB N="373" REF="375"/>
take a husband of <HI>his</HI> chusing (<HI>any</HI> low fel∣low,
I suppose, he thinks good enough for
me) or immediately to go into a nunnery.
Oh! Sir, and she catched hold of his hand,
as you are a gentleman, if you have com∣passion,
any humanity towards an unfortu∣nate
woman, try to deliver me out of his
hands. I have a pretty good sum of money
in my possession; contrive the means of my
escape; my gratitude to you shall be un∣bounded!
and she wrung his hand.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, said Pivet, looking tender∣ly
at her, I would it were in my power; I
should think myself but too happy if it were
possible for me to accomplish what you re∣quest;
but I fear it will be impracticable: I
declare to you, if I were at my own dispo∣sal,
I would fly with you to the remotest
part of the world; but I am a young man,
who have my fortune to make: I am under
particular ties here, and have besides such
obligations to Mr. Faulkland, as make it
impossible for me, consistently with <HI>honour,</HI>
to interfere in this business.</P>
<P>Sir, said she eagerly, can't you write a let∣ter
for me, or furnish me with the means of
informing my friends in England of my situ∣ation?</P>
<P>Madam, said he, before Mr. Faulkland
permitted me the honour of seeing you, he
engaged my solemn promise that I would not
intermeddle in your affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="376"/>
Lord, what will become of me! What
would you, Sir, advise me to do? For as for
that wretch (meaning me), I am determin∣ed,
if I can help it, not to suffer him to
come near me.</P>
<P>'Tis a very nice point, Madam: I really
do not well know how to advise: but, to be
sure, a nunnery is a choice not to be recom∣mended
to a lady of your youth and beauty,
unless your inclinations lead you that way;
then indeed—</P>
<P>She interrupted him. Don't name it to
me, Sir; don't name it: I am determined
to keep out of <HI>that</HI> snare, if it be for nothing
but an opportunity to be revenged on that
tyrant: I would marry a beggar sooner than
give up that hope.</P>
<P>As for that, Madam, said Pivet, I sup∣pose
Mr. Faulkland would not be so ungene∣rous
as to compel you to marry one beneath
you: there are many young men of good
families who would think themselves honour∣ed
by your acceptance of them: your perso∣nal
accomplishments alone are a sufficient re∣commendation;
but Mr. Faulkland menti∣ed
to me the additional advantage of fortune.
I dare answer for him he will not think of be∣stowing
you unworthily.</P>
<P>I had charged Pivet not to go too far: he
thought it time to break off the conversation;
and, rising up, he told Mrs. Gerrarde he was
going into my apartment, and desired to
<PB N="375" REF="377"/>
know if she would honour him with any com∣mands.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, I shall only beg you will
tell Mr. Faulkland, that I never <HI>can</HI> think of
his proposal; that I am very ill, and beg to
be left in quiet for a few days; but shall be
very glad to see <HI>you</HI> whenever you are at lei∣sure.</P>
<P>He bowed, and left her; then came di∣rectly
to me, and repeated the conversation
he had with her word for word. I am glad,
said I, to find you are so much in her good
graces: it will accelerate my plot; but we
must not make you too cheap: if we manage
discreetly, she may possibly think herself ve∣ry
well off to get you.</P>
<P>At present I stand pretty well with her,
Sir, said Pivet: she does not suspect that I
am your servant: I fear if she did, as the la∣dy
seems to have a high spirit, she would for∣bid
me her presence.</P>
<P>I found Pivet had no mind to have this
part of his situation explained: his vanity
had been highly tickled at passing upon her
for a gentleman and <HI>my</HI> friend.—He
had, in obedience to my orders, spent much
of his time with her during the few days that
I had been too ill to see her. I had, at my
first introduction of him to her, cautioned
him against letting her know in what capaci∣ty
he was with me: I did not then give him
my reasons for this, and he supposed they
<PB N="376" REF="378"/>
were no other, than that, finding it necessa∣ry
to have him pretty much with her in her
confinement, I did not chuse to alarm her
pride by the knowledge of his station. I did
not hint at my design, till the day before I had
prevailed on her to write the letter to Mr.
Arnold. Pivet did not at all disrelish the pro∣posal:
he had not been blind to Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
charms: he only seemed surprized at
my being willing to part with her so soon;
for he had not the least conception of my rea∣sons
for carrying her off, and very naturally
concluded I was deeply engaged in an amour.
It was not difficult to guess his thoughts on
this occasion.</P>
<P>Pivet, said I, I must premise one thing to
you: I assure you there is not, nor ever was,
any intrigue between Mrs. Gerrarde and me.
I do not, however, pretend to vouch for her
chastity. It was no secret at V—hall that
she had occasioned an unhappy breach in Mr.
Arnold's family; and that, and that <HI>only</HI> (as
I have a most particular value and affection
for that family), was my motive to the carry∣ing
this lady away. As I hope the disunion
(now the cause of it is removed) will no
longer subsist, I find it necessary to provide
for Mrs. Gerrarde some way or other. A good
husband I would wish to bestow on her. I do
not yet know whether I shall be able to bring
her into any measures; but if she should be
prevailed on to accept of you, and I should
<PB N="377" REF="379"/>
make it worth your while to accept of her,
can you overlook the levity she has been guil∣ty
of, and resolve to use her kindly?</P>
<P>He promised he would make the best hus∣band
in the universe. I bid him not be too
sure of success, as I did not yet know Mrs.
Gerrarde's mind, and feared I should find it
hard to bring her into terms; adding, that
though I intended to threaten her, I should
be very unwilling to make use of compulsi∣on;
but if she should happen to like him,
without suspecting my design, I might ac∣complish
my purpose with less reluctance on
her side, and much more satisfaction to my∣self.</P>
<P>The conversation he had just had with her
elated him highly: she had made him her
confidant; she had implored his assistance;
she had promised an <HI>unbounded</HI> gratitude;
she had prohibited <HI>my</HI> visits, and invited <HI>his.</HI>
All this facilitated my work, and I at one
time thought of letting her e'en work out her
fate, and run blindfold into my trap; for it
is plain, if Pivet had given into it, she would
have marched off with him, and even marri∣ed
him, to get out of my clutches; and
then, you know, she could have blamed no
body but herself for the consequences. But
I resolved not to impose on the gypsey any
farther; but let her know what she was to
expect before the bargain was concluded,
and at least give her her option of having
<PB N="378" REF="380"/>
the power of continuing a jilt, or being ca∣nonized
for a saint.</P>
<P>I found things were now likely to take
such a turn as I wished; but it still required
management. Pivet, said I, you must let
her see you no more to day, it will make
her prize your company the more: keep out
of the way, that you may not be seen by
Rachael; and give such orders in the house,
as that there may be proper attendance for
the lady. One of my footmen spoke a little
French, and he had been directed to receive
and communicate Mrs. Rachael's orders in
the family.</P>
<P>Tho' Pivet assured me that he thought
Mrs. Gerrarde was not so ill as she said she
was, I yet thought it incumbent on me to
have the advice of a physician. The people
with whom I lodged said I could not have a
better than the doctor who had attended
me, as he was reckoned very skilful. I told
them, in the present case, I believed honesty
was more requisite than skill. They said
he was very honest too; so I desired he
might be sent for.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, being determined to car∣ry
on the farce of sickness, pretended she was
not able to rise; and the doctor was intro∣duced
to her bed-side. As he could neither
understand his patient, nor make himself un∣derstood
by her, I had ordered the footman,
whom I mentioned to you before, as know∣ing
<PB N="379" REF="381"/>
a little French, to wait at the chamber
door; for I was resolved so far to keep up my
resentment and my importance, as not to
vouchsafe assisting at the conference; which,
by this means, became the most ridiculous
scene you can imagine. The doctor having
felt Mrs. Gerrarde's pulse, proposed his ques∣tions
by the footman, who just peeped his
nose in at the door. He explained them
(very ill I suppose) to Rachael in English,
who re-repeated them to her lady within her
curtains; for she would not suffer them to
be drawn back. Mrs. Gerrarde's answers
travelled the same round-about way back ty
the doctor, who got them mangled in vero
bad French from his interpreter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, provoked, I believe, at
the doctor's visit, and very much tired of his
questions, asked peevishly where Monsieur
Pivet was? This inquiry I expected; and
the fellow who told me of it, had been orde∣red
to inform her that Monsieur Pivet was
not at home.</P>
<P>The doctor, after leaving his patient, came
to me, and confirmed the character I had re∣ceived
of him, both for skill in his professi∣on,
and integrity in his practice; for he told
me very honestly, that he thought the lady
was in perfect health. I thought the doctor
deserved a double see, and accordingly gave
it to him; requesting him, however, to con∣tinue
his visits: for I told him, that, though
<PB N="380" REF="382"/>
the lady might really be very well, she was,
however, a little vapourish.</P>
<P>I left her to her reflections the whole day.
Rachael inquired three or four times of the
footman if Mr. Pivet was come in, but was
always answered in the negative. I was plea∣sed
at her sollicitude about him.</P>
<P>I desired him to wait on her the next day,
at the time the doctor paid his visit; and in∣structed
Pivot to ask the doctor, in her pre∣sence,
what he thought of her case, and to
report his answer fairly to her; for I was re∣solved
not to let her imagine that she impo∣sed
on me.</P>
<P>The doctor, by Pivet's means, discoursed
with her more readily than he had done the
day before. Pivet asked his opinion of her
disorder, and the physician declared it as free∣ly
as he had done to me; adding, he should
not have repeated his visit, if I had not in∣sisted
on it.</P>
<P>Pivet could not help smiling. Mrs. Ger∣rarde
observed it; for, I suppose, she watch∣ed
his countenance, and asked him what the
Doctor had said. He says, Madam, what
gives me a vast deal of pleasure; which is,
that your disorder is entirely imaginary.
He is an ignorant fellow, said Mrs. Gerrarde;
and you may tell him I desire to see him no
more. The poor doctor, who knew not what
she said, made her half a dozen scrapes, and
withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383"/>
She then drew back her curtain; and re∣assuming
the subject she had been upon the
day before with Pivet, asked him if he had
any conversation with me about her? and
what resolution I had come to?</P>
<P>Pivet (who had begged I would leave this
conference entirely to his management) seem∣ed
to hesitate a little, and appeared melan∣choly.
We have had some talk about you,
Madam, said he; and Mr. Faulkland tells me,
if you reject the nunnery scheme (which I
think he seems to be fondest of), that he has
a person in his thoughts, who, he believes,
will be a suitable match for you, if you are
willing to accept of it; if not—here he
stop'd. What if I should not, Sir? Pray
speak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I hope, Madam, he will not carry
matters to an extremity. Extremity, Sir!
Do you think he can be brutal enough to
force me into a nunnery? Are there no laws
in France? I <HI>hope</HI> he will not, Madam; but
I can't pretend to answer for him: he is a
strange man: he seems out of temper too:
the doctor told him nothing ailed you; he
believes him, and spoke harshly on the occa∣sion.
And what, said she, is the match that
he calls <HI>suitable?</HI> One of his footmen per∣haps,
or his barber?</P>
<P>Pivet affected to look concerned. He tells
me, Madam, he has cast his eyes on a young
man, well born, and genteelly educated; not
contemptible in his personal accomplishents,
<PB N="382" REF="384"/>
and one who he is sure will make you a fond
and obliging husband.</P>
<P>Pivet sighed deeply, and cast his eyes lan∣guishingly
on her. You seem concerned,
Sir, said she. Do you know the person? It
is my doubt on that occasion, Madam, that
is the cause of my uneasiness. Pray explain
yourself, Mr. Pivet. Madam, I dare not,
he replied, with great solemnity. I will only
assure you, that whoever the person be,
whom Mr. Faulkland has not yet named to
me, I think him the happiest man in the
world. What can be his meaning, asked
Mrs. Gerrarde, for telling you <HI>so</HI> much, and
yet concealing the person's name? He says,
he has not proposed it yet to the gentleman,
Madam; and as, he tells me, he can't in
honour conceal any part of your story, he is
fearful—I beg your pardon, Madam; you
will excuse me if I do not repeat his scruples
on this occasion. I understand, you, Sir.
He supposes his friend will reject me. Some
such insinuation he threw out, Madam, said
Pivet. I told him, that he need only permit
the gentleman to <HI>see</HI> you; and if he then
made any objection, he must be the blindest
and most insensible man alive. He spoke
this with a warmth that seemed highly plea∣sing
to the lady. She bowed, and answered,
<HI>All</HI> men, Sir, are not as generous as you.
But what did Mr. Faulkland say to this? He
only smiled, and said he wished his friend
<PB N="383" REF="385"/>
might think as I did; that he would tell me
his name another time; and that, in the
mean time, it would oblige him if my visits
to you were less frequent. Inhuman monster,
said she; would he debar me of the only sa∣tisfaction
I have? Let me but live to get out
of his hands! if I can escape him by any
means, I will find ways to reckon with him
for this. Be so good, Mr. Pivet, to tell him,
that I am content to take the person he offers,
let him be who he will: I expect nothing
from him but insults; therefore shall not be
surprized if I see myself sacrificed to some
despicable wretch: but any, <HI>any</HI> thing is
better than to be in the power of such a ty∣rant!
Madam, answered Pivet, you need
not fear the being compelled to accept of an
unworthy object: Mr. Faulkland declares,
that if you should absolutely dislike the
gentleman, when you see him, he will be
far from constraining you to take him for your
husband. The other choice is still open to
you, and, by what I can judge, Mr. Faulk∣land
seems to wish you would give that the
preference. I would die first, cried Mrs.
Gerrarde—The fool, does he think I can
be so entrapped? No, no; the authority of a
husband, even of Faulkland's chusing, can∣not
be such a bar to my revenge as the walls
of a nunnery would be.—Sir, I think myself
obliged to you, and flatter myself you would
have served me if you could. I may yet have
<PB N="384" REF="386"/>
it in my power to make you a return for your
kind intentions towards me. I presume,
when Mr. Faulkland has disposed of his pro∣perty,
you will then be absolved of your
promise to him in regard to me, and will still
have charity enough to befriend an unfortu∣nate
woman. She wept, and Pivet owned he
was ready to do so too; but constraining him∣self,
protested she should command his
life, and withdrew full of seeming uneasi∣ness.</P>
<P>He told me what had passed between him
and the lady, and I could not help approv∣ing
his management of the scene, though
the rogue had stretched beyond the truth;
but stratagems, you know, are allowable in
love, and a lover he was now become in good
earnest.</P>
<P>He had taken care to alarm Mrs. Gerrarde's
apprehensions at every passage of access. He
had informed her, that I had a husband for
her in my thoughts; and at the same time,
that he avoided the most distant hint of its
being himself, he engaged her favour by
seeming to wish it <HI>were.</HI> Then he took care
to insinuate, at least, a possibility of her be∣ing
refused by the person designed for her,
and this he very naturally supposed would
raise his own consequence with her, in case
any suspicion should fall on him, of his be∣ing
the intended husband. He pretended I
had taken umbrage at his visiting her, still
<PB N="385" REF="387"/>
more to inflame her resentment against me,
and increase her impatience to deliver herself
out of my hands; at the same time he art∣fully
hinted that he was not the man destin∣ed
to be happy. This, as he saw already he
was not unacceptable to her, he thought
would make him doubly welcome, when she
should find herself no worse off. Then the
nunnery was mentioned, in terrorem, with
broad hints of my resolution. In short, Pi∣vet
played his part so cunningly, that it had
all the effect he could have wished; and
Mrs. Gerrarde, finding her spirit matched,
was obliged to surrender at discretion.</P>
<P>I own I did not expect to have succeeded
so soon; and without Pivet, who had now a
feeling in the affair, I certainly should not. I
resolved directly to make the best use of the
advantage I had gained. I told Pivet that
he should be married the next day. He was
so transported at the thought, that he begged
I would give him leave to go to Mrs. Ger∣rarde,
to declare his love and his good for∣tune
together; for, Sir, said he, you know
she promises to accept of whomsoever you
propose, and I hope she will not despise
your choice so much as she thinks she
shall. Softly, softly, good Monsieur Pivet,
your violent hurry will spoil all. I do not
mean that you shall see her till to-morrow.
Not till to-morrow! Ah Sir! do, I beseech
<PB N="386" REF="388" MS="y"/>
you, Sir, allow me; she will think it very
cruel. (Poor Pivet, thought I, thou wilt
have enough of her.) Simpleton (to him),
this day's suspence will forward your business
more than all you could say to her in seven
hours: is it not enough you are sure of her?
We have other things now to mind. What
plan of life do you purpose to pursue? You
know I have promised to do handsomely for
you.</P>
<P>Sir, said he, I always intended to follow
the business I was bred to; and if this piece
of extraordinary good fortune had <HI>not</HI> hap∣pened
to me, I did purpose, tho' you have
been the best of masters to me, to have ask∣ed
your permission to return to my friends,
in order to settle in my trade, as I have some
capital of my own. But to be sure, Sir, I
shall be directed in this, as in every thing
else, by your will and pleasure. I approve
of your design intirely, said I; but there are
certain conditions that must be previously
settled between you and me. In the first
place, tell me honestly, what is the capital
you say you are worth.</P>
<P>He answered, his father had left him a∣bout
eight thousand livres, which were in
the hands of a banker in Paris, whom he
named to me, and referred me to him for
confirmation of the truth of what he told
me.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="389"/>
Well, said I, this will go a good way to∣wards
setting you up in your own business.
Where do you think of settling?</P>
<P>He answered, Paris was the best place for
his trade.</P>
<P>On that I put an absolute negative; I said
Paris was too much frequented by my coun∣trymen,
to be a proper place for Mrs. Ger∣rarde
to make her appearance in, as she was
likely to meet there with more of her acquain∣tance
than might be convenient: I told him
I had no objection to any other large provin∣cial
town.</P>
<P>He said he was born at Dijon, and should
like to go thither, as he had many friends
there.</P>
<P>Be it so, said I: What I purpose doing
for you is this. Mrs. Gerrarde has eight
hundred pounds of her own; I will add as
much more to it, for which I will give you
my bond, till I can have the money remitted
from England; and this you shall settle on
her, that she may be sure of a support in
case of your death, and the interest you shall
allow her for her own separate use, but with∣out
her knowing that you are tied down to
it, that you may have it in your power to o∣blige
her.</P>
<P>He made no reply, but acquiesced with a
low bow.</P>
<P>I laughed at the simplicity of his counte∣nance.
Pivet, said I, though I have taken
<PB N="388" REF="390"/>
care of Mrs. Gerrarde's interest, I do not in∣tend
to neglect yours, provided you make no
demur to the terms. You already know my
reasons for proceeding as I have done in this
affair. I have great cause to apprehend Mrs.
Gerrarde's vindictive spirit, if she should find
means, which I know she will endeavour at,
to lay open the real state of this transaction
to some people in England. This might fru∣strate
all that I have been at so much pains to
accomplish; be it your care then to prevent
it. I cannot wish you to use harsh measures
with your wife; but if you have address
enough to prevent a correspondence with any
one in England, (an elopement, for both
your sakes, I am not willing to suppose;
though I think, for some time at least, you
must keep a strict eye over her) if, as I said,
you can prevent a correspondence, I think it
will answer my purpose; and that I may
make it your interest to do this, I will bind
myself, by as strong an obligation as the law
can make, to pay you two hundred pounds
a year English, so long as you keep your wife
within the bounds prescribed; provided, if,
after three years, I find those terms no lon∣ger
necessary, they shall, if I then chuse it,
become void. I shall also add something to
enable you to fit up a house and a shop, that
you need not be under a necessity of break∣ing
in upon your capital.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="391"/>
Pivet's gratitude overflowed at his lips for
this (as he called it) noble provision. He
said, he made no doubt of gaining so far up∣on
Mrs. Gerrarde's affections, as to be able
effectually to fulfil his covenant, without
using violent methods; but, said he, at all
events, I warrant you shall hear no more of
her.</P>
<P>Preliminaries thus adjusted, I sent for a
notary of reputation, to whom I gave instruc∣tions
to draw up two separate articles for the
purposes mentioned; the latter was to be a
secret between Pivet and me, as it was by no
means proper for Mrs. Gerrarde to be let in∣to
it. The other, which regarded her own
particular settlement, was intended for her
perusal and approbation. I charged the no∣tary
to use dispatch, and he promised to have
both the papers ready by next morning,
as also the bond which I was to give Pi∣vet
for the payment of eight hundred
pounds.</P>
<P>The lawyer brought the papers according
to his promise, and they were signed, sealed,
and delivered in due form. That which was
to be the private agreement between Pivet
and me, was worded in consequence of an
article which I drew up myself, and made
Pivet sign; wherein I set forth particulars at
large.</P>
<P>Pivet was very impatient to see his belo∣ved,
but a little uneasy lest she should be dis∣gusted
<PB N="390" REF="392"/>
with him, when she should come to
know the situation he had been in. I bid
him not be discouraged, telling him I should
set off that circumstance of his having been
my gentleman (for so I chose to call him)
in the most favourable light. I presented
him with a very elegant suit of cloaths,
which I had never worn, and which fitted
him very well, as you know he is nearly of
my size. You cannot imagine how handsome
the fellow looked when he was dressed, for
he had linen and every thing else suitable to
his cloaths.</P>
<P>I then desired him to wait on his goddess;
but he, who had been so eager a little be∣fore,
was now quite abashed at the thoughts
of making his pretensions known to the lady,
and intreated me to present him to her. I
saw he was quite disconcerted at the serious
scene he was going to engage in.</P>
<P>I pitied him, and told him I would go with
him to Mrs. Gerrarde; but that it was pro∣per
first to prepare her a little.</P>
<P>He said he thought so too.</P>
<P>I immediately sent for Rachael, and speak∣ing
to her at the door, without letting her see
Pivet, I bid her tell her mistress that I pur∣posed
making her a visit in half an hour,
and should introduce the gentleman, whom
I expected she would, according to her pro∣mise,
receive at my hands for her husband;
reserving to herself still the liberty of chu∣sing
<PB N="391" REF="393"/>
the other alternative, in case she disliked
him.</P>
<P>Pivet shewed the sollicitude of a lover, af∣ter
this message was sent to his mistress; Poor
dear lady, said he, how I pity her? What
must she suffer in this interval? But your
presence, Monsieur Pivet, said I, will dispel
all her fears, and make her the happiest of
women.</P>
<P>The poor fellow was out of countenance,
and, I dare say, as anxious as Mrs. Gerrarde.</P>
<P>As I received no answer from her to my
message, I construed her silence as leave to at∣tend
her; and accordingly, at the appointed
time, I entered her apartment, leading Pivet
by the hand.</P>
<P>She was sitting at a table, leaning her head
on one of her hands: she cast a look of scorn
at me, and immediately withdrew her eyes,
not so much as deigning to glance them at
Pivet, little imagining that it was <HI>he</HI> who ac∣companied
me, though she knew it was her
intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Pivet was not able to speak; he trembled,
and, like a true inamorato, ran to her, clapt
one knee to the ground, and ventured,
though with great diffidence, to take one of
her hands.</P>
<P>This action obliged the haughty fair one
to vouchsafe him a glance of her eye.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="394"/>
Her surprize, spite of her assumed airs of
grandeur, was not to be concealed; it was
apparent, she coloured, and though she in∣tended
to have been solemn and losty, she
even <HI>stared;</HI> and I could discover a little
gleam of pleasure dance over her counte∣nance.</P>
<P>What! Monsieur Pivet? And then she
looked at me, as if for an explanation.</P>
<P>Yes, madam, said I, Monsieur Pivet <HI>is</HI>
the man, (I was going to say the <HI>happy</HI> man,
but I did not mean to compliment her; my
business was not to make her think I was do∣ing
her a favour.) It has been your good for∣tune
to make a conquest of him; and in the
hope of your making him a good wife, as I
am sure he will make you a good husband, I
have consented to the match; and I spoke
this in the tone of one, who thinking he has
conferred a great obligation on an undeser∣ving
object, expects to be thanked for it.</P>
<P>The woman, with all her art and assurance
to boot, was quite confounded. I did not
give her time to recover herself, but taking
the settlement out of my pocket, and reading
it to her, Look there, madam, and see if I
have injured you in the disposal of your per∣son
and your fortune.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde, always alert when her in∣terest
was in the question, took the paper,
and notwithstanding her confusion, read it
entirely over. Pivet's handsome appearance,
<PB N="393" REF="395"/>
joined to her former prepossessions, had made
so good an impression on her, that she began
to think the matter worth attending to.
When she had read the paper, she put it in∣to
Pivet's hands. Sir, said she, it should ap∣pear
by this that you have acted generously;
but as I have already been imposed upon by
that gentleman (looking at me) all this may,
for aught I know, be a deceit; but as it is
not in my power to make terms for my self,
it is to no purpose for me to make objections,
or to enquire any farther. I am ready to
accept your offer, only I should be glad to
know who the man really is, that I am to
make my husband.</P>
<P>She spoke this with such an air of disdain,
that the poor lover, shrunk up and diminish∣ed
in his own eyes, left me to make an an∣swer.
Mrs. Gerrarde, said I, I declare to
you solemnly that there is no deception in any
thing which you see, nor any foul play meant
to you. This young man, whom I now pre∣sent
to you for your husband, is well born,
and has many genteel relations in this coun∣try;
he has it in his power, to my certain
knowledge, to make good the settlement he
proposes for you, which I will take care to
see properly secured. That part of it which
is your own property, you have now in your
possession, the other half I know is in his.
He was brought up to a creditable business,
<PB N="394" REF="396"/>
which he intends to follow. I know him to
be good natured, and of an obliging temper.
He lived with me some time, and accompa∣nied
me in my travels. I suppose his having
been my gentleman, which station he did
uot accept through necessity, will not be a
material objection (and I smiled and affected
to look very proud), and I only mention it to
convince you that I have no design of decei∣ving
you, or concealing any part of his cha∣racter.</P>
<P>Pivet coloured (for I stole a side glance at
him) and looked sheepish. He began an
aukward compliment with a bow, and ‘I
hope, madam’—but I relieved him; and
speaking to Mrs. Gerrarde, You know all now
madam, that can be known; therefore, if
you are disposed to keep your word, let us put
an end to this business to-day. To-day, Sir!
Yes, to-day, madam. What occasion is
there for farther delay?</P>
<P>Pivet now plucked up his courage, and
begged, since she had consented, that she
would not defer his happiness. I told her,
between mirth and chiding, that I was in
haste to get rid of my charge, and was there∣fore
determined to make her over to Mr. Pi∣vet
that evening; and telling her I would
give orders about the ceremony, left the lo∣vers
to make out for themselves a scheme of
conjugal felicity. Pivet pleaded his own cause
so effectually, that, in the evening, I had the
<PB N="395" REF="397"/>
satisfaction of bestowing, with my own hand,
that inestimable treasure of virtue and meek∣ness,
Mrs. Gerrarde, on my faithful Squire,
Monsieur Pivet; to the no small joy of the
latter, and I believe, if the truth were known,
to the no great mortification of the former.
Mrs. Rachael and myself were the only wit∣nesses
of this illustrious union.</P>
<P>When the ceremony was over, I ap∣proached,
according to custom, to congra∣tulate
and salute the bride; but she turned
her saucy cheek to me, and affected the
whole night vast dignity of behaviour; yet it
was so foreign to her nature, that it appear∣ed
ridiculous; however it was better than
ranting.</P>
<P>I invited them both to sup with me, and
treated Pivet with a familiar civility that seem∣ed
to please him highly, as it did him credit
in the presence of his lady.</P>
<P>After supper, Pivet entreated me to com∣plete
the friendly and generous offices I
had already done him, by undertaking the
settlement of all money matters for him. As
he knew I intended to go to Paris, he beg∣ged
I would receive for him the sum he had
in the hands of the banker, which, he said,
if I would remit to him, it would enable him
to enter upon his business immediately. At
the same time he (with no ill grace) presented
me my bond again, assuring me he relied in∣tirely
<PB N="396" REF="398"/>
upon my honour for the execution of
my promise to him, farther requesting that
I would put that, together with Mrs. Ger∣rarde's
money, if she approved of it, into
such hands as I should judge most proper for
her advantage.</P>
<P>I was pleased at the openness of his pro∣ceedings,
and promised to do every thing for
their mutual satisfaction; but insisted on his
keeping the bond, or lodging it in some pro∣per
hand, till I could redeem it, by paying
the money, which should take care should be
speedily done. I told him I thought the
sooner he set out for his own province the
better. He said, he should be ready the next
day, if Mrs. Gerrarde (for he did not yet
presume to call her by his own name) did
not object to it. He appealed to her with
his looks.</P>
<P>She had scarce condescended to open her
lips before; but now answered, You may be
sure, Sir, I shall not think it too soon to get
out of a prison.</P>
<P>He asked her if she chose to take her maid
Rachael along with her?</P>
<P>Certainly, she said; I should not be fond of
having a servant about me, by whom I should
not be understood.</P>
<P>Rachael was now called in, and the thing
proposed to her. She seemed rather inclined
to return to England; but I told her she
<PB N="397" REF="399"/>
could not, in gratitude, desert her lady in a
strange country; and that if she had a mind
to make me her friend, which she should find
me upon any future occasion, she would attend
her home, and continue with her till her
mistress was willing to part with her.</P>
<P>The girl upon this consented to stay, and
received Mrs. Gerrarde's orders to prepare
for their departure the next day.</P>
<P>In the morning I made Pivet a present for
his travelling charges, and Rachael another;
telling her according to the account I should
have of her behaviour, that I would be kind
to her. She made me all the promises that
I could desire; assuring me, that it was
purely to oblige me that she staid with Mrs.
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>Pivet told me, that he would send the sum
which his wife had, in bills to me, to be ap∣propriated
in the manner agreed on: for, he
said, that having that morning mentioned to
her my generosity, in relation to the bond,
she had owned, that, notwithstanding her
resentment to me, she had no distrust of my
honour in <HI>those</HI> particulars.</P>
<P>I took this opportunity of telling Pivet,
that when he could get his wife in the hu∣mour,
he might prevail on her to give an
instrument, impowering my steward to re∣ceive
the little income of her jointure at Ash∣by,
which I would take care should be re∣mitted
<PB N="398" REF="400"/>
to him; for, trifling as it was, it
might be serviceable.</P>
<P>When they were ready to set forward on
their journey, I begged leave to speak a few
words to madam Pivet by herself. She seem∣ed
not inclined to the conference, but her
husband very obligingly pressing her not to
part with me in enmity, and at the same
time quitting the room, she was obliged to
hear me.</P>
<P>I then very frankly asked her pardon for
the lengths I had gone; telling her, that I
hoped time, and her own good sense, would
convince her that she was more obliged to
me, than her passion would then give her
leave to see. Remember, madam, I have
kept my word with you. You are now mar∣ried
to a very deserving young man; you
have a competent support during your life.
Happiness is in your power, if you do not
wilfully cast it away from you. Shew now
that greatness of mind of which you have so
often boasted, by forgiving the man, who has,
as you think, injured you; and resolving at
once on a behaviour that shall, in your turn,
intitle you, not only to the forgiveness, but
even to the esteem, of those whom you have
injured.</P>
<P>I would have preached on, and given her
more good advice, but she cut me short,
with this decisive answer. Sir, I neither de∣sire
your counsel nor your good opinion;
<PB N="399" REF="401"/>
Mr. Pivet <HI>may</HI> deserve some regard from me,
but <HI>you</HI> I never will forgive, and she flung
from me.</P>
<P>I called in Pivet, and telling him I was in∣finitely
pleased at the good disposition I found
his lady in, I wished him all happiness and a
safe journey, and they set out directly for
Dijon.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Bidulph, stop, to
praise, to admire, to wonder at my virtue!
I, who have had one of the finest women in
England in my possession, for so many days
(and by the way was not her aversion) to
yield up her (by me) unpolluted charms to
the arms of another! Add to this, that it has
cost me more to make one woman honest,
than it need have done to have made half a
dozen—otherwise. I had like to have writ
a strange ugly word, that was just at the nib
of my pen.</P>
<P>If you relate my story with the laudable
partiality of a friend, judiciously abolishing
the context (for which you may have many
precedents), and neatly splicing together the
useful fragments, shall I not appear to poste∣rity
as great as Scipio himself? Ah! Sir
George, if we knew the secret springs of
many of those actions which dazzle us, in
the histories of the renowned heroes of old,
it is not impossible but the wonderous page
might dwindle into as insignificant a tale as
mine is.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="402"/>
Well, I thank my good genius that has led
me safely through such a labyrinth as I had
got into. In getting rid of that woman
(and not disgracefully neither), I feel as if I
had shaken off a great load. But what a
graceless baggage it is, not to thank me for
my kindness. I, who have been more than
a father to her, in saving her first from per∣dition,
and then settling her well in the
world—but there is no obliging some
tempers.</P>
<P>I shall leave this place to-morrow, for I
must hasten to Paris, to put every thing on
a good footing for the new-married pair;
and then I will go and ramble I do not care
whither, for another year. I shall lodge at
Paris, where I did before, and desire you
will write to me directly an account of all
that passes within the circle of your family.
Let your sister and my lady Bidulph know in
what manner I have disposed of Mrs. Ger∣rarde;
but be sure you do it discreetly, and
take care not to mention that paultry cir∣cumstance
of her settlement, or any other
private agreement with Pivet. I know Mrs.
Arnold's delicacy would be hurt by the
knowledge of this; therefore beware of
dropping the least hint of it, at your peril.
Tell lady Bidulph I will pray devoutly for her
daughter's happiness; if what I have done
will promote it, it will not a little contribute
to my own; tho' I begin to feel it is not to
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>
be expected in this life, at least by such a
hopeless wanderer as I am.</P>
<P>I could sit now, and indite melancholy
verses, or write an elegy, or make my will,
or do any other splenetic thing: in short, I
have a good mind to turn monk and go into
a monastery. I am sure I should have lady
Bidulph's vote for that.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Bidulph, you will not
hear from me again, perhaps, till I am in
another region.</P>
<P>Nov. 30.</P>
