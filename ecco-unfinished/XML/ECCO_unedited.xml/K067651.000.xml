<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had lately a very extraordinary Dream, which
made so strong an Impression on me, that I
remember it every Word: and if you are not
better employed, you may read the Relation of it, as
follows.</P>
<P>Methought I was in the Midst of a very agreeable
Set of Company, and extremely delighted in attend∣ing
to a lively Conversation; when on a sudden I
perceived one of the most shocking Figures, Imagi∣nation
can frame, advancing towards me. She was
dressed in black: her Skin was contracted into a
thousand Wrinkles, her Eyes deep sunk in her Head,
and her Complexion pale and livid as the Countenance
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
of Death. Her Looks were filled with Terror
and unrelenting Severity; and her Hands were
armed with Whips and Scorpions. As soon as she
came near, with a horrid Frown, and a Voice that
chilled my very Blood, she bade me follow her: I
obeyed; and she led me through rugged Paths beset
with Briars and Thorns, into a deep solitary Valley.
Wherever she past, the fading Verdure withered be∣neath
her Steps: her pestilential Breath infected the
Air with malignant Vapours, obscured the Lustre of
the Sun, and involved the fair Face of Heaven in
an universal Gloom. Dismal Howlings resounded
through the Forest: from every baleful Tree the
Night Raven uttered his dreadful Note; and the
whole Prospect was filled with Desolation and Hor∣ror.
In the midst of this tremendous Scene, my
execrable Guide addressed me in the following
Manner:</P>
<P>“Retire with me, O rash unthinking Mortal,
from the vain Allurements of a deceitful World;
and learn that Pleasure was not designed the
Portion of human Life. Man was born to mourn,
and to be wretched. This is the Condition of
all below the Stars, and whoever endeavours to
oppose it, acts in Contradiction to the Will of
Heaven. Fly then from the fatal Enchantments
of Youth and social Delight: and here consecrate
thy solitary Hours to Lamentation and Woe.
Misery is the Duty of all sublunary Beings; and
every Enjoyment is an Offence to the Deity,
who is to be worshipped only by the Mortification
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
of every Sense of Pleasure, and by the ever∣lasting
Exercise of Sighs and Tears.”</P>
<P>This melancholy Picture of Life quite sunk my
Spirits, and seemed to annihilate every Principle of
Joy within me. I threw myself beneath a blasted
Yew, where the Winds blew cold and dismal round
my Head, and dreadful Apprehensions chilled my
Heart. Here I resolved to lie till the Hand of Death,
which I impatiently invoked, should put an End to
the Miseries of a Life so deplorably wretched. In
this sad Situation, I spied on one Hand of me, a deep
muddy River, whose heavy Waves rolled on, in slow
sullen Murmurs. Here I determined to plunge; and
was just upon the Brink, when I found myself sud∣denly
drawn back: I turned about and was surprised
by the Sight of the most lovely Object I had ever
beheld. The most engaging Charms of Youth and
Beauty appeared in all her Form: effulgent Glories
sparkled in her Eyes, and their awful Splendors
were softened by the gentlest Looks of Compassion
and Peace. At her Approach the frightful Spectre,
who had before tormented me, vanished away, and
with her all the Horrors which she had caused. The
gloomy Clouds brightened into chearful Sunshine;
the Groves recovered their Verdure, and the whole
Region looked gay and blooming as the Garden of
<HI>Eden.</HI> I was quite transported at this unexpected
Change, and reviving Pleasure began to gladden my
Thoughts: when, with a Look of inexpressible
Sweetness, my Deliverer thus uttered her divine
Instructions.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="103"/>
“My Name is <HI>Religion.</HI> I am the Offspring of
<HI>Truth,</HI> and the Parent of <HI>Benevolence, Hope,</HI> and
<HI>Joy.</HI> That Monster, from whose Power I have
freed you, is called <HI>Superstition.</HI> She is the Child
of <HI>Discontent,</HI> and her Followers are <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Sor∣row.</HI>
Thus different as we are, she has often the
Insolence to assume my Name and Character, and
seduces unhappy Mortals to think us the same,
till she, at length, drives them to the Borders of
Despair; that dreadful Abyss, into which you
were just going to sink.”</P>
<P>“Look round, and survey the various Beauties
of this Globe, which Heaven has destined for the
Seat of Human Race, and consider, whether a
World thus exquisitely framed, could be meant
for the Abode of Misery and Pain! For what End
has the lavish Hand of Providence diffused such in∣numerable
Objects of Delight, but that all might
rejoice in the Privilege of Existence, and be filled
with Gratitude to the beneficent Author of it?
Thus to enjoy the Blessings he has sent, is Virtue
and Obedience; and to reject them, merely as the
Means of Pleasure, is pitiable Ignorance, or absurd
Perverseness. Infinite Goodness is the Source of
created Existence. The proper Tendency of every
rational Being, from the highest Order of raptured
Seraphs to the meanest Rank of Men, is to rise
incessantly from lower Degrees of Happiness to
higher; and each have Faculties assigned them for
various Orders of Delight.”</P>
<P>“What,” cried I, “is this the Language of
<HI>Religion?</HI> Does she lead her Votaries through
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
flowery Paths, and bid them pass an unlaborious Life
of gay Amusement? Where are the painful Toils
of Virtue? The Mortifications of Penitents, and
the self-denying Exercises of Saints and Heroes?
Are these only the gloomy Conceits of visionary
Devotees? Are there no Difficulties to be en∣countered?
No Restraints to be endured? Does
the Whole of Human Duty consist in the chearful
Enjoyment of a beautiful World, and a constant
Indulgence of the soft Transports of Pleasure?”</P>
<P>“Not such a Kind of Pleasure,” answered she,
“as arises from the thoughtless Gaiety of a useless
Life. The Enjoyments of a reasonable Being
cannot consist in unbounded Indulgence, or luxu∣rious
Ease; in the Tumult of licentious Passion,
the Languor of indolent Repose, or the Flutter
of light Amusements. Yielding to immoral Plea∣sures
corrupts the Mind; living to animal and
trifling ones, debases it; both, in their Degree,
disqualify it for it's genuine Good, and consign
it over to Wretchedness. Whoever would be
really happy, must make the diligent and regular
Exercise of his superior Powers his chief Atten∣tion,
adoring the Perfections of his Maker, ex∣pressing
Good-will to his Fellow creatures, and
cultivating inward Rectitude. To his lower Fa∣culties
he must allow such Gratifications as will,
by refreshing him, invigorate his nobler Pursuits.
In the Regions inhabited by Angelic Natures, un∣mingled
Felicity for ever blooms: Joy flows there
with a perpetual and unbounded Stream; nor
needs there any Mound to check it's Course.”
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
“Beings conscious of a Frame of Mind originally
diseased, as all the Human Race has Reason to
be, must use the Regimen of a stricter Self-Go∣vernment.
Whoever has been guilty of volun∣tary
Excesses, must patiently submit both to
the painful Workings of Nature, and needful Se∣verities
of Medicine, in order to his Cure. Still
he is intitled to a moderate Share of whatever al∣leviating
Accommodations this fair Mansion of his
merciful Parent affords, consistent with his Re∣covery;
and, in Proportion as this Recovery ad∣vances,
the liveliest Joy will spring from his secret
Sense of an amended and improving Heart.—So
far from the Horrors of Despair is the Condition
even of the Guilty.—Shudder, poor Mortal, at
the Thought of that Gulph into which thou wast
going to plunge.”</P>
<P>“While the more Faulty have every Encourage∣ment
to amend, the more innocent Soul will be
supported with still sweeter Consolations, under
all it's Experience of Human Infirmities: Sup∣ported
by the gladdening Assurances, that every
sincere Endeavour to out-grow them shall be as∣sisted,
accepted, and rewarded. To such a one,
the lowliest Self-Abasement is but a deep-laid
Foundation for the most elevated Hopes: since
they, who faithfully examine, and acknowledge
what they are, shall be enabled, under my Con∣duct,
to become what they desire. The Chris∣tian
and the Hero are inseparable; and to the
Aspirings of unassuming Trust, and filial Consi∣dence,
are set no Bounds. To him, who is ani∣mated
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
with a View of obtaining Approbation from
the Sovereign of the Universe, no Difficulty is
unsurmountable. Secure in this Pursuit of every
needful Aid, his Conflict with the severest Pains
and Trials, is little more than the vigorous Exer∣cise
of a Mind in Health. His patient Depen∣dence
on that Providence, which looks through
all Eternity, his silent Resignation, his ready Ac∣commodation
of his Thoughts and Behaviour to
it's inscrutable Ways, is at once the most excel∣lent
sort of Self-denial, and a Source of the most
exalted Transports. Society is the true Sphere of
human Virtue. In social active Life, Difficulties
will perpetually occur; Restraints of many Kinds
will be nccessary: and studying to behave right in
Respect of these, is a Discipline of the human
Heart useful to others, and improving to itself.
Suffering is no Duty, but where it is necessary to
avoid Guilt, or to do Good; nor is Pleasure a
Crime, but where it strengthens the Influence of
bad Inclinations, or lessens the generous Activity
of Virtue. The Happiness allotted to Man in his
present State, is indeed faint and low, compared
with his immortal Prospects and noble Capacities:
but yet, whatever Portion of it the distributing
Hand of Heaven offers to each Individual, is a
needful Support and Refreshment for the present
Moment, so far as it may not hinder the Attain∣ment
of his final Destination.”</P>
<P>“Return then, with me, from continual Misery,
to moderate Enjoyment, and grateful Alacrity.
Return from the contracted Views of Solitude, to
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
the proper Duties of a relative and dependent Be∣ing.
Religion is not confined to Cells and Clo∣sets,
nor restrained to sullen Retirement: these
are the gloomy Doctrines of Superstition, by which
she endeavours to break those Chains of Benevo∣lence
and social Affection, that link the Wel∣fare
of every Particular with that of the Whole.
Remember, that the greatest Honour you can pay
to the Author of your Being, is by such a chear∣ful
Behaviour, as discovers a Mind satisfied with
his Dispensations.”</P>
<P>Here my Preceptress paused: and I was going to
express my Acknowledgments for her Discourse,
when a Ring of Bells from the neighbouring Village,
and a new-risen Sun darting his Beams through my
Windows, awaked me.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS very many well-disposed Persons, by the
unavoidable Necessity of their Affairs, are
so unfortunate as to be totally buried in the
Country, where they labour under the most deplor∣able
Ignorance of what is transacting among the po∣lite
Part of Mankind, I cannot help thinking but
that, as a public Writer, you should take the Case
of these truly-compassionable Objects under your
Consideration.</P>
<P>These unhappy Languishers in Obscurity, should
be furnished with such Accounts of the Employments
of People of the World, as may engage them, in
their several remote Corners, to a laudable Imita∣tion:
or, at least, so far inform and prepare them,
that if, by any joyful Change of Situation, they
should be suddenly transported into the gay Scenes,
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
they may not gape, and wonder, and stare, and be
utterly at a Loss how to behave, and make a proper
Appearance in it.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much the Welfare of all the
Country Towns in the Kingdom might be promoted,
if you would use your charitable Endeavours to raise
in them a noble Emulation of the Manners and Cus∣toms
of higher Life.</P>
<P>For this Purpose, you should give a very clear and
ample Description of the whole Set of polite Acquire∣ments;
a complete History of Forms, Fashions, Fro∣lics,
of Routs, Drums, Hurricanes, Balls, Assem∣blies,
Ridottos, Masquerades, Auctions, Plays, O∣peras,
Puppet-shows and Bear-gardens: of all those
Delights which profitably engage the Attention of
the most sublime Characters, and by which they have
brought to such amazing Perfection the whole Art
and Mystery of passing Day after Day, Week after
Week, and Year after Year, without the heavy As∣sistance
of any one thing, that formal Animals are
pleased to call useful or necessary.</P>
<P>In giving due Instructions through what Steps to
attain this Summit of human Excellence, you may
add such irresistible Arguments in it's Favour, as
must convince Numbers, who in other Instances do
not seem to want natural Understanding, of the un∣accountable
Error of supposing they were sent into the
World for any other Purpose but to flutter, sport,
and shine: for, after all, nothing can be clearer,
than that an everlasting Round of Diversion, and
the more sprightly and hurrying the better, is the
most important End of human Life.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="110"/>
It is really prodigious, so much as the World is
improved, that there should, in these Days, be Per∣sons
so ignorant and stupid, as to think it necessary
to mis-spend their Time, or trouble their Heads
about any thing else than pursuing the present Fan∣cy:
for what else is worth living for?</P>
<P>It is Time enough surely to think of Consequen∣ces
when they come: and as for the antiquated No∣tions
of Duty, they are not to be met with in any
<HI>French</HI> Novel, or any Book one ever looks into, but
derived almost wholly from the Writings of Authors
who lived a vast many Ages ago, and who, as they
were totally without any Idea of those Accomplish∣ments
which now characterize People of Distinction,
have been for some Time sinking apace into utter
Contempt. It does not appear that even their most
zealous Admirers, for some Partizans of his own sort
every Writer will have, can pretend to say they were
ever at one Masquerade. In the important Article
of Diversions, the Ceremonial of Visits, the extatic
Delight of unfriendly Intimacies, and unmeaning
Civilities, they are absolutely silent. Blunt Truth
and downright Honesty, plain Cloaths, staying at
Home, hard Work, few Words, and those unen∣livened
with Censure or double Meaning, are what
they recommend as the Ornaments and Pleasures of
Life. Little Oaths, polite Dissimulation, Tea-table
Scandal, delightful Indolence, the Glitter of Finery,
the Triumph of Precedence, the Enchantments of
Flattery, are things of which they seem to have had
no Notion: and one cannot help laughing, to think
what a Figure they would have made in a Visiting∣room,
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
and how frighted they would have looked at
a Gaming-table. The noble Zeal of Patriotism,
that disdains Authority, and tramples on Law for
Sport, was their absolute Aversion: and, indeed,
one cannot discover any one thing that they pretend
to teach People, but to be wise and good; Accom∣plishments
infinitely below the Consideration of Per∣sons
of Taste and Spirit, who know how to spend
their Time to so much better Purpose.</P>
<P>Among other admirable Improvements, pray,
Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> do not forget to enlarge on the very
extensive Benefits of playing at Cards on <HI>Sundays;</HI> a
Practice of such infinite Use, that we may modestly
expect to see it universally prevail in all Parts of this
Kingdom. To Persons of Fashion, the Advantage
is obvious: because, as for some strange Reason or
other, which no fine Gentlemen or Lady has yet
been able to penetrate, there is neither Play not
Masquerade, nor bottled Conjurer, nor any other
thing worth living for, to be had on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> if it
were not for the charitable Assistance of Whist or
Bragg, the genteel Part of Mankind must, one Day
in seven, necessarily suffer a total Extinction of
Being.</P>
<P>Nor are Persons of high Rank the only Gainers
by so salutary a Custom, which extends it's good
Influence, in some Degree, to the lower Orders of
People: but, were it quite general, how much bet∣ter
and happier would the World be, than it is even
now.</P>
<P>It is hard upon poor Creatures, be they ever so
mean, to deny them those Enjoyments and Liberties
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
which are equally open for all: yet if Servants were
taught to go to Church on this Day, to spend some
Part of it in reading, or receiving Instruction in a
Family Way, and the rest in mere friendly Conver∣sation,
the poor Wretches would infallibly take it
into their Heads, that they were obliged to be sober,
modest, diligent, and faithful to their Masters and
Mistresses. Now surely none of common Prudence
and Humanity would wish their Domestics infected
with such strange primitive Notions, or laid under
such unmerciful Restraints: all which may, in a
great Measure, be prevented, by the Prevalence of
the good-humoured Fashion, which I would have
you recommend. For when the lower Kind of
People see their Betters, with a truly laudable Spirit,
insulting and flying in the Face of those rude ill-bred
Dictators, Piety, and the Laws, they are thereby
excited and admonished, as far as Actions can admo∣nish
and excite, and taught, that they too have an
equal Right of setting them at Defiance, in such In∣stances
as their particular Necessities and Inclinations
may require: and thus is the Liberty of the whole
human Species mightily improved and enlarged.</P>
<P>In short, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> by a faithful Representa∣tion
of the numberless Benefits of a modish Life, you
will have done your Part in promoting, what every
Body seems to confess the true Purpose of human
Existence, perpetual Dissipation. By encouraging
People to employ their whole Attention on Trifles,
and to make Amusement their sole Business, you will
teach them how to avoid many uneasy and trouble∣some
Reflexions. All the soft Feelings of Humanity,
