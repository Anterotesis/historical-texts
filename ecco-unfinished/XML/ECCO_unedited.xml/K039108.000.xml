<P>BY
<HI>WILLIAM EDDIS,</HI>
LATE SURVEYOR OF THE CUSTOMS, &amp;c. AT

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IF an apology for the publication of these
Letters be thought as necessary by the
readers as it is by the author, he has only
to say, and, however hackneyed such ex∣cuse
may be considered, he can say it with
great truth, that his appearance in print
is more owing to the suggestion of some
partial friends, than to his own intentions.</P>
<P>The author arrived on the American
continent in the year 1769, and settled at
Annapolis, under the patronage and protec∣tion
of the then governor of Maryland:
from his situation there, he became inti∣mately
acquainted with the leading charac∣ters
of every party in that province, and
with every event which occurred subse∣quent
to his own arrival, until the unfor∣tunate
<PB REF="3"/>
misunderstanding, which arose be∣tween
the parent state and the colonies,
rendered it impossible for every one, like
him sincerely and steadily attached to the
former, to continue in the country.</P>
<P>What he saw and observed from the first
period of his residence there, he occasionally
communicated to his friends in England;
and as he had the opportunity of seeing,
and observing much, it has been conceived
by some respectable characters, for whose
judgment he has the greatest deference, that
the correspondence originally intended for
private amusement only, contained matter
sufficiently interesting to engage the atten∣tion
of the public.</P>
<P>The former part of these letters will
be found to give a description of the coun∣try,
government, trade, manners, and cus∣toms
of the inhabitants; the latter, the
<PB REF="4"/>
rise and gradual progress of the civil dis∣sention,
which is not perhaps so well
known, at least so far as the province of
Maryland was concerned, as are the con∣sequences
which attended it.</P>
<P>The conclusion will not, it is hoped, be
thought the least interesting part of the
work, as it represents the difficulties and
dangers to which the author was exposed,
from his loyalty, and unshaken attachment,
to the British constitution.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>York Town, Virginia, <DATE>Aug. 30th, 1769.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM, my dear friend, at length safely
landed on the American continent.
Our voyage has been tedious; we have en∣countered
hard gales, and contrary winds;
but of these I think no more. I am now
become an inhabitant of a new world; and
I enter into it, not only with the common
feelings of a stranger, whose attention is
engaged by the novelty of every surround∣ing
<PB N="2" REF="50"/>
object, but with the more interesting
reflexion, that this country is not more new
to me than are my hopes and expectations
in it; and that I am here, under the pa∣tronage
of new friends, to engage in new
pursuits. With this impression, I cannot
but form an ideal connexion between what
I see, and what I feel. I mean not, how∣ever,
that this should at all influence the
narrative which I shall occasionally trans∣mit
to you; <HI>that,</HI> as far as is in my
power, shall contain no more than what
may be supposed naturally to suggest itself
to any indifferent spectator, whom curiosity
or amusement has carried into a distant
country.</P>
<P>I will begin with acquainting you, that
the situation of this town is exquisitely
beautiful, and the adjacent country very
romantic and picturesque. The noble
river Chesapeak is full in view, which,
<PB N="3" REF="51"/>
in the narrowest part, is at least ten miles
broad, and runs a course of near three
hundred, navigable for the largest ships.
Many considerable rivers discharge them∣selves
into this bay, by which the ad∣vantages
of commerce are extended to the
interior country; and planters whose ha∣bitations
are far remote from the ocean,
receive at their own doors, by water con∣veyance,
the various productions of dis∣tant
nations.</P>
<P>From hence to Annapolis, the des∣tined
scene of my future pursuits, is two
hundred miles; for which place I shall
embark on board a schooner, the instant
I receive my baggage, and hope speedily
to impart the particulars of a most fa∣vourable
reception.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="52"/>
Chesapeak Bay, <DATE>Sept. 1st.</DATE></P>
<P>YESTERDAY I made an excursion to
Williamsburgh, the metropolis of Vir∣ginia,
the situation of which is by no
means equal to York Town. The capi∣tal
where the delegates of the people
assemble, is neat and elegant; the college
and the governor's palace, are likewise
handsome edifices; but I did not distin∣guish
any other buildings which particu∣larly
merited observation. I was, how∣ever,
greatly entertained by the variegated
beautiful prospects, lofty woods, and highly
cultivated plantations, which presented
themselves to me in every direction.</P>
<P>I am now on my passage for Anna∣polis;
a gentle breeze wafts us pleasantly
on our course; the day is splendid, and
the interesting and magnificent objects
which continually strike the eye, infinitely
exceed the utmost powers of description.
<PB N="5" REF="53"/>
Innumerable vessels of different denomina∣tions
are floating in every point of view,
which add to the grandeur of the scene,
and impress the mind with agreeable ideas
of commercial advantages.</P>
<P>The course we are steering is nearly
south; we have passed many noble rivers
on both sides the bay, particularly the Po∣tomac,
on the western shore; which, at
the entrance, is several miles in breadth,
and is navigable for ships of great burthen
to Alexandria, about forty leagues from
its influx. At a small distance above that
place are some considerable falls, which
interrupt the navigation of vessels further
up the country; but I am informed that a
plan is in agitation to remove this obstruc∣tion;
and should success attend the execu∣tion,
it is scarcely conceivable to what an
immense distance commerce may be then
extended.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="54"/>
The Potomac separates Virginia from
Maryland; but there are countries belong∣ing
to each province on both sides the bay.
In the Maryland government, the divi∣sion
is nearly equal; but in that of Virginia,
their territory on the western shore is in∣finitely
more extensive, more populous,
and more important than on the eastern.</P>
<P>These immense waters are diversified
with an infinite number of islands of the
most varied and beautiful appearance.
Some are cultivated; others entirely co∣vered
with lofty, valuable timber. It is
almost impossible, on viewing the natural
advantages of this country, to avoid antici∣pating
the future political and commercial
importance of America.</P>
<P>A few weeks since, the Thames was the
most considerable river I had ever beheld;
it is now, comparatively, reduced to a di∣minutive
<PB N="7" REF="55"/>
stream: but, may its real im∣portance
increase to the end of time!—
May the wealth of all nations flow in with
every tide, to the encouragement of arts
and manufactures, and to the general ad∣vancement
of the riches and prosperity of
Britain!</P>
<P>Early to-morrow, I hope to land at An∣napolis.
The cliffs which bound the en∣trance
of the Severn, are now in view;
but the wind is too light, and the distance
too remote to permit us to entertain a hope
of reaching the harbour before morning.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sept. 4th.</DATE></P>
<P>EARLY yesterday I was safely landed
at my desired port. The master of the
schooner conducted me to a tavern, where,
after a slight repast, I made the necessary
preparations to appear before the Gover∣nor.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="56"/>
My reception was equal to my warmest
wishes. The deportment of Governor
Eden was open and friendly. He invited
me to meet a party at dinner, and I took
leave, till the appointed hour, with a heart
replete with joy and gratitude.</P>
<P>Understanding that I was in time for
divine service, I availed myself of an im∣mediate
opportunity to offer up my servent
acknowledgements at the throne of grace;
and to entreat Heaven to dispense blessings
on those with whom my fate is inseparably
connected.</P>
<P>The exterior appearance of the church
has little to recommend it, but the con∣gregation
was numerous. The solemn of∣fices
were performed with a becoming
devotion; and my mind was perfectly in
unison with the important duties of the
day.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="57"/>
On my return to the Governor, he in∣troduced
me, in the most obliging terms,
to several persons of the highest respecta∣bility
in the province. He treated me
with the utmost kindness and cordiality;
assured me of his strongest disposition to
advance my future prosperity, and gave
me an unlimited invitation to his hospita∣ble
table.</P>
<P>I could not but consider these circum∣stances
of my reception and introduc∣tion,
as a prelude to future advantages.
The pleasing transactions of the day ex∣hilarated
my spirits; I evidently per∣ceived
a prepossession in my behalf; I ex∣erted
my utmost to improve the favour∣able
impression, and retired to rest with
a serenity to which I had been long un∣accustomed.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="58"/>
A ship in the road is preparing to
sail. I have not time to add more. <HI>You</HI>
know where remembrances are due, and
will impart them. The first vessel that
arrives from England will, I trust, con∣vey
pleasing intelligence of the welfare
of my family, and of yourself. Under
all the eventful circumstances of life, be
assured I shall remain unalterably yours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="11" REF="59"/>
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Oct. 1st, 1769.</DATE></P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the receipt of your
letter, the painful information had
arrived, that Powell was no more! He
was the valued friend of my early youth,
and I shall ever cherish his remembrance
with unabated attachment. To men∣tion
his professional excellence is unne∣cessary;
the unanimous voice of the pub∣lic
having firmly established his superior
pretensions. Nor need I express my fears,
that it is improbable we shall quickly
“look upon his like again;” for how sel∣dom
is it that the great requisites of acting
are so united in one man, as they were in
him! Great, however, as his loss is to
the public, it is still greater to his friends;
<PB N="12" REF="60"/>
to these who knew, as we did, his mild
and amiable manners; his easy and unaf∣fected
vivacity; and his uniform candour
and benevolence. My feelings on hearing
of his death, were much augmented by the
particulars of a circumstance immediately
preceding it: After having contended se∣veral
days with the violence of his disorder,
nature appeared totally exhausted, and he
had lain, for a considerable time, with
scarce a symptom of existence. His sur∣rounding
friends had mournfully yielded
him to his fate; and were expecting each
moment the last convulsive exertion! when
suddenly starting, with wonderful expres∣sion
in his countenance, he repeated the
speech in Macbeth, commencing with the
words: “Is this a dagger—” tracing
with his eye the imaginary movement of
the delusive phantom; then a short period
of recollection took place—he appeared
conscious of having been under the influ∣ence
<PB N="13" REF="61"/>
of a delirium—invoked Heaven for
mercy, and sunk lifeless on his pillow!
What a strong instance of the ruling pas∣sion,
in his final exit! In him I have lost
a faithful, animated friend; and “friends
grow not thick on every bough.” But
no more of this—I will endeavour to re∣lieve
my mind from the intrusion of me∣lancholy
ideas, by attempting to gratify
your curiosity respecting this place, and its
environs.</P>
<P>Annapolis is nearly encompassed by the
river Severn, and, with every advantage
of situation, is built on a very irregular
plan. The adjacent country presents a va∣riety
of beautiful prospects, agreeably diver∣sified
with well settled plantations, lofty
woods, and navigable waters. In our lit∣tle
metropolis, the public buildings do not
impress the mind with any idea of magni∣ficence,
having been chiefly erected during
<PB N="14" REF="62"/>
the infancy of the colony, when conve∣nience
was the directing principle, with∣out
attention to the embellishment of art.</P>
<P>The court-house, situated on an emi∣nence
at the back of the town, commands
a variety of views highly interesting; the
entrance of the Severn, the majestic Che∣sapeak,
and the eastern shore of Maryland,
being all united in one resplendent assem∣blage.
Vessels of various sizes and figures
are continually floating before the eye;
which, while they add to the beauty of
the scene, excite ideas of the most pleas∣ing
nature.</P>
<P>In the court-house, the representatives
of the people assemble, for the dispatch
of provincial business. The courts of jus∣tice
are also held here; and here, like∣wise,
the public offices are established.
This building has nothing in its appearance
<PB N="15" REF="63"/>
expressive of the great purposes to which
it is appropriated; and by a strange neglect,
is suffered to fall continually into decay;
being, both without and within, an em∣blem
of public poverty, and at the same
time a severe reflection on the government
of this country, which, it seems, is con∣siderably
richer than the generality of the
American provinces.</P>
<P>The council chamber is a detached
building, adjacent to the former, on a very
humble scale. It contains one tolerable
room, for the reception of the governor
and his council, who meet here during the
sitting of the assembly; and whose con∣currence
is necessary in passing all laws.</P>
<P>I am not yet enabled, from my own ob∣servation,
to form any accurate judgment
respecting the political disposition of the
colonists; but, if the information I have
<PB N="16" REF="64"/>
received may be relied on, they attend with
a jealous eye to the conduct of their re∣spective
governors; and to every regula∣tion
in the parent state, which relates to
their external or internal interests. In
the northern provinces, a republican spirit
evidently prevails; and in the middle and
southern, they are, perhaps, too ready in
taking the alarm, whenever they conceive
any measures are in agitation which may
lessen their importance, embarrass their
trade, or render them more dependent on
the mother country. Almost from the
commencement of their settlements, they
have occasionally combated against real, or
supposed innovations; and I am persuaded,
whenever they become populous, in pro∣portion
to the extent of their territory,
they cannot be retained as British subjects,
otherwise than by inclination and interest.
But I am wandering into a wide, unpleas∣ing
field of political disquisition, instead
<PB N="17" REF="65"/>
of pursuing the more agreeable path of
description.</P>
<P>The governor's house is most beautifully
situated, and when the necessary alterations
are completed, it will be a regular, conve∣nient,
and elegant building. The garden
is not extensive, but it is disposed to the
utmost advantage; the centre walk is ter∣minated
by a small green mount, close to
which the Severn approaches; this eleva∣tion
commands an extensive view of the
bay, and the adjacent country. The same
objects appear to equal advantage from the
saloon, and many apartments in the house;
and perhaps I may be justified in asserting,
that there are but few mansions in the most
rich and cultivated parts of England, which
are adorned with such splendid and roman∣tic
scenery.</P>
<P>The buildings in Annapolis were for∣merly
of small dimensions, and of an in∣elegant
<PB N="18" REF="66"/>
construction; but there are now
several modern edifices which make a good
appearance. There are few habitations
without gardens; some of which are
planted in a decent stile, and are well
stocked.</P>
<P>At present, this city has more the ap∣pearance
of an agreeable village, than the
metropolis of an opulent province, as it
contains within its limits a number of small
fields, which are intended for future erec∣tions.
But in a few years, it will probably
be one of the best built cities in America,
as a spirit of improvement is predominant,
and the situation is allowed to be equally
healthy and pleasant with any on this side
the Atlantic.</P>
<P>There is not, however, any probability
that Annapolis will ever attain any im∣portance
in a commercial point of view:
<PB N="19" REF="67"/>
the harbour is not capable of containing
many vessels of considerable burthen; and
the hazard of being frozen up, for a long
period, during winter, is a powerful obsta∣cle
to mercantile purposes. It is, however,
the seat of Government; the public offices
are here established; and as many of the
principal families have chosen this place
for their residence, there are few towns, of
the same size, in any part of the British
dominions, that can boast a more polished
society.</P>
<P>You cannot travel any considerable dis∣tance
in this country, without crossing ri∣vers,
many of them wider than the Thames
at Woolwich. Over these, regular ferries
are established, at the charge of the respec∣tive
counties; but though every proper

a number of considerable waters unavoida∣bly
occasion great delay.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="68"/>
In the vicinity of Annapolis are many
pleasant villas, whose proprietors are emi∣nent
for their hospitality. Colonel Sharp,
the late Governor, possesses a most de∣lightful
retirement, about seven miles dis∣tant;
his house is on a large scale, the
design is excellent, and the apartments
well fitted up, and perfectly convenient.
The adjacent grounds are so judiciously
disposed, that utility and taste are every
where happily united; and when the wor∣thy
owner has completed his extensive
plan, Whitehall will be one of the most
desirable situations in this, or in any of
the neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>Colonel Sharp has resided many years in
this country, where he has established a
reputation which reflects the highest ho∣nour
on his public capacity, and on his
private virtues. This gentleman does not
seem to entertain any idea of returning to
<PB N="21" REF="69"/>
his native land, but appears inclined to
spend the residue of his days, within the
limits of a province, which he has so long
governed with honour to himself, satisfac∣tion
to the people, and fidelity to his so∣vereign.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>October 19th.</DATE></P>
<P>I HAVE lately made an excursion to the
eastern shore of this province. As the
narrative may possibly afford you some
entertainment, I shall here endeavour to
give you an account of the particulars of
our journey.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth instant, the gover∣nor
and his lady, with a party of gentle∣men,
amongst whom I had the honour to
be included, embarked on board a vessel
properly accommodated for our reception;
the weather was remarkably fine, and a
pleasant gale wafted us, in about five hours,
to the seat of Mr. C—.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="70"/>
This gentleman resides on an island in the
Chesapeak, about seven miles in length, and
of different breadth; the whole of which,
being his intire property, is well cultivated,
and produces great quantities of tobacco,
grain, cattle, and stock of various kinds;
and as it abounds likewise with game, the
worthy proprietor lives, in a manner, inde∣pendent
of mankind, the monarch of his
little fertile territory.</P>
<P>Early on the following morning, seve∣ral
of the neighbouring gentry visited the
island, to pay their respects to the gover∣nor,
and invitations poured in from every
quarter. We were, however, under the
necessity of declining these proofs of atten∣tion;
his Excellency being obliged, on the
sixteenth, to attend some provincial con∣cerns
in Annapolis. Accordingly, after
partaking of a substantial breakfast, in the
true American style, which consisted not
<PB N="23" REF="71"/>
only of tea, coffee, and the usual accompa∣niments,
but likewise of ham, dried veni∣son,
beef, and other relishing articles, we
took leave of our friendly host, ferried over
from his island to the main land, where car∣riages
were waiting for our accommodation,
and proceeded about twenty miles along the
banks of the Chesapeak.</P>
<P>In the course of this little tour, we pas∣sed
several plantations, which not only pro∣claimed
the opulence, but the taste of their
owners. About noon, we arrived opposite
Kent Island, which, on that side, is only
divided by a narrow stream from the main
land: we were quickly conveyed to the
opposite shore, and in a short time came to
the house of Mr. H. where we enjoyed
a cheerful evening; and on the following
day embarked for the seat of government.</P>
<P>Kent Island is a narrow tract of land,
about twenty miles in length, fertile, and
<PB N="24" REF="72"/>
well settled; many of the inhabitants pos∣sessing
not only the comforts, but the
elegancies of life. This delectable spot
forms one parish, the clerical emoluments
of which afford a comfortable, if not an
affluent subsistence to the incumbent.
Kent Island ranges along the Bay, at the
distance of about ten miles from the west∣ern
shore, and beautifully terminates a most
delightful prospect, highly variegated with
wood and water.</P>
<P>As you cannot but be solicitous concern∣ing
my views and expectations, you will
be glad to learn that they are highly fa∣vourable.
In England there are few, even
in great departments of the state, who pos∣sess
so extensive a patronage as the gover∣nor
of Maryland; and I am perfectly as∣sured,
that his inclination to promote my
interest is in full proportion to his abi∣lity.
But public affairs do not, at this
<PB N="25" REF="73"/>
juncture, wear the most flattering aspect.
You, who know with what applause the
repeal of the stamp act was received on
this side the Atlantic, will not be surprized
to hear, that a revival of the claim of taxa∣tion,
by laying duties on other articles, has
renewed the apprehensions and discontents
which had happily subsided: and the esta∣blishment
of admiralty courts, during the
course of the preceding year, appears to
have raised a determined opposition to the
proceedings of government. To know
where it will terminate is beyond the reach
of human penetration. Associations are
forming from one extremity of this conti∣nent
to the other; few appear to dissent
from the popular creed; and it seems to be
generally admitted, that if the Americans
steadily adhere to their non-importation
agreement, they will from the interest, if
not from the equity of the Parent State,
obtain redress of grievances. “Statist I
<PB N="26" REF="74"/>
am none, nor like to be;” therefore am by
no means competent to deliver my senti∣ments
on this very alarming subject. There
are some zealots, who are frantic enough
to affect a bold language, and to talk of
hostile measures, if arguments and pacific
remonstrances should prove ineffectual; but
such men are deservedly treated with con∣tempt
by the wise and dispassionate. I am
persuaded, the principal persons in every
government, are not inclined to adopt any
measures but what are founded on rec∣titude
and moderation, from a settled be∣lief,
that calm and respectful applications
from the legislative body, will eventually
be productive of every desired consequence.</P>
<P>But enough of politics. I am looking
forward, with impatience, to the day which
will restore me to those who must partici∣pate
in my good, or evil fortune. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 15, 1770.</DATE></P>
<P>COLONEL F—, a gentleman of
considerable property, and a mem∣ber
of the council, early in December,
engaged the governour, with a circle of
select friends, to pass a few days, during
the Christmas vacation, at his seat in Cal∣vert
County, about seventy miles distant
from Annapolis. Having the honour to
be included in the party, I embarked on
the twenty-second, with the colonel, on
board a schooner which he had fitted up
for occasional excursions; and considering
the season of the year, we had a pleasant
run to the place of our destination, which
is delightfully situated within view of the
Chesapeak, on the fertile banks of the
river Patuxent.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="76"/>
Rousby Hall, which is the name of my
friend's hospitable mansion, is as well
known to the weary indigent traveller, as
to the affluent guest. In a country where
hospitality is the distinguishing feature, the
benevolent owner has established a pre∣eminence,
which places his character in
an exalted point of view.</P>
<P>The governor, on account of some par∣ticular
engagements, did not quit Anna∣polis
till the twenty-sixth; and on the
thirtieth I accompanied Colonel F—to
the habitation of a gentleman, about twen∣ty
miles distant, where, by appointment,
we met his Excellency, with a numerous
party, who had assembled to bid him wel∣come.
All the good things of a plentiful
country decorated the table of our muni∣ficent
host; the wines were excellent, and
various; and cheerful blazing fires, with
enlivening conversation, exhilarated the
<PB N="29" REF="77"/>
spirits, and rendered us totally regardless
of the rigour of an American winter. On
the ensuing day, the whole company pro∣ceeded
to Rousby Hall, where we conti∣nued,
in the full enjoyment of genuine
hospitality, till the third month; and it
was with the utmost reluctance we were
then permitted to take our departure.</P>
<P>Since we quitted Colonel F—, we
have visited most of the principal families
in Calvert, St. Mary's, Charles, Prince
George's, and Anne Arundel Counties; and
were every where received with the most
obliging proofs of regard and attention.
From the severity of the weather, we oc∣casionally
encountered some hardships and
inconveniences, but we were amply com∣pensated
at the end of every stage, by excel∣lent
accommodations, and sumptuous fare.
Notwithstanding the dreary season, the eye
was gratified with many picturesque and
noble objects: we travelled a considerable
<PB N="30" REF="78"/>
way on the banks of the great river Potow∣mac,
which separates Maryland from Vir∣ginia;
and though this country is greatly
inferior, in its present state, to the highly
cultivated parts of South Britain, yet, on
the whole, it is well settled; the generality
of the plantations are disposed with the ut∣most
regularity, and in very many of the
habitations we found elegance as well as
comfort.</P>
<P>We passed an agreeable evening with a
family, nearly opposite to Alexandria in
Virginia; and, had the weather been mo∣derate,
intended to have crossed the river
on a visit to Major Washington, who, as
you may recollect, particularly distinguish∣ed
himself in the transactions of the late
war: this gentleman has a pleasant seat on
the banks of the Potowmac, in the vici∣nity
of the above town, which is named
Mount Vernon, where he resides in full
possession of universal love, and esteem.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="79"/>
Yesterday we returned safe to Annapolis,
greatly satisfied with our expedition.</P>
<P><DATE>February 20.</DATE></P>
<P>ON Saturday last our little city appeared
in all its splendor. It was the anniver∣sary
of the proprietary's birth. The go∣vernor
gave a grand entertainment on the
occasion to a numerous party: the com∣pany
brought with them every disposition
to render each other happy; and the fes∣tivity
concluded with cards, and dancing,
which engaged the attention of their re∣spective
votaries till an early hour.</P>
<P>I am persuaded there is not a town in
England of the same size as Annapolis,
which can boast a greater number of fa∣shionable
and handsome women; and were
I not satisfied to the contrary, I should
suppose that the majority of our belles pos∣sessed
every advantage of a long and fami∣liar
<PB N="32" REF="80"/>
intercourse with the manners and ha∣bits
of your great metropolis.</P>
<P>I am told that beauty in this country is
not of long duration: it is also asserted
that, in general, the men do not possess
such good stamina as the natives of Great
Britain. Though every way equal in ge∣nius
and enterprize, they are supposed less
able to support fatigue, and to encounter
the hardships of laborious employments.</P>
<P>During the winter there are assemblies
every fortnight; the room for dancing is
large; the construction elegant; and the
whole illuminated to great advantage. At
each extremity are apartments for the card
tables, where select companies enjoy the
circulation of the party-coloured gentry,
without having their attention diverted by
the sound of fiddles, and the evolutions
of youthful performers.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="81"/>
About Christmas an intense frost set in,
which has continued till a few days since,
with unremitting severity. Our principal
rivers, for several weeks, have been pass∣able
for carriages heavily laden; and in
particular situations, innumerable skaters
have exhibited on the glassy surface their
feats of dexterity.</P>
<P>It is certainly extraordinary, that in a
latitude nearly parallel with Gibraltar, the
inhabitants should experience, for a consi∣derable
duration, a degree of cold to which
the northern extremities of the British
Islands have never been accustomed: this,
I am informed, proceeds entirely from local
circumstances; the winds, prevalent in
winter, blowing over those immense lakes,
situated to the westward of this, and some
neighbouring provinces, impregnate the
air with frigid particles, that make us
<PB N="34" REF="82"/>
sensible of an inclemency equal to that ex∣perienced
by the shivering Laplander.</P>
<P>In this country a heavy snow generally
precedes the frost, during the continuance
of which the atmosphere is beautifully se∣rene,
without any of those pernicious fogs
so prevalent in your humid climate.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the extensive forests
that abound throughout this vast conti∣nent,
fuel is an expensive article in all the
considerable towns: provisions are in ge∣neral
cheap, but the price of labour is
high, from which circumstance firing is
comparatively dear, even on the most oeco∣nomical
plan. I am, however, persuaded
that, by prudent management, a respec∣table
appearance may be supported in Ma∣ryland,
on terms infinitely more reason∣able
than in most parts of the mother
<PB N="35" REF="83"/>
country; and that greater opportunities
are afforded to the industrious and enter∣prising,
to lay the foundation of a com∣fortable
provision for a succeeding genera∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>April 2, 1770.</DATE></P>
<P>I THANK you, my friend, for your
very warm congratulations, on my pre∣sent
happy, and promising establishment.
The scene is, indeed, reversed; the remem∣brance
of former disappointments tends but
to excite a grateful sensibility of that pro∣vidential
goodness which has safely con∣ducted
me through a maze of difficulties
and embarrassments, restored me to all the
blessings of domestic peace, and, appa∣rently
placed me in a situation that has
little to fear from a reverse of fortune.</P>
<P>You have been rightly informed respect∣ing
the conduct of our worthy governor.
From every observation I have, hitherto,
been enabled to make, he appears perfectly
<PB N="37" REF="85"/>
competent to the discharge of his impor∣tant
duty. Not only in the summer, but
during the extreme rigour of an Ameri∣can
winter, it is his custom to rise early:
till the hour of dinner he devotes the
whole of his time to provincial concerns;
the meanest individual obtains an easy, and
immediate access to his person; he investi∣gates,
with accuracy, the complicated duties
of his station; and discovers, upon every oc∣casion,
alacrity in the dispatch of business;
and a perfect knowledge of the relative con∣nexions
of the country.</P>
<P>Had he been appointed to succeed a
person who had consulted his private
advantage in preference to that of the
public; who had been found unequal to
the discharge of his important trust, or
remiss in the execution it would have re∣quired
no extraordinary exertion of abi∣lities
to have appeared in a favourable
<PB N="38" REF="86"/>
point of view. But his immediate prede∣cessor,
by the invariable rectitude of his
conduct, the affability of his manners, and
his unremitting attention to the happiness
and prosperity of Maryland, had establish∣ed
a well merited popularity, which, du∣ring
an administration of sixteen years,
continued in full force, and has secured to
him the unabated love, and attachment of
a grateful people.</P>
<P>That our present supreme magistrate pos∣sses
an extensive capacity for government,
is, indeed, obvious to the most superficial
observer; but it may be objected, that ex∣perience
is yet wanting to confirm his
claim to eminent distinction. I admit the
force of the objection; and will likewise
acknowledge the influence of partiality.
He is my patron! my benefactor! I may
possibly be animated by the impulse of
gratitude, to delineate his conduct in the
<PB N="39" REF="87"/>
strongest colours. To time I therefore
leave him, the only true criterion by
which any character can be properly esta∣blished.
To that incontestible decision he
himself emphatically appeals in the conclu∣sion
of his first speech to the general as∣sembly
of the province. Let me quote a
declaration which, should he be found de∣fective,
will stand recorded to his disad∣vantage,
and likewise prove that I have
seen through a false medium, and have
been too precipitate in drawing conclu∣sions.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Gentlemen of both Houses,”</OPENER>
<P>“I am sensible that I shall be judged
of my actions, and not by any assu∣rances
I may now give you of my fu∣ture

submit, and shall be truly happy,
when I leave you, to be able, like my
<PB N="40" REF="88"/>
predecessor, to lay my hand on my heart,
in confidence of having acted solely on
the principles here laid down; and of
having merited, by so doing, the thanks
of those over whom I have the honour
to preside.”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Maryland is a proprietary government,
and owes its original settlement to religious
motives. In the year 1632, Lord Balti∣more,
who then possessed considerable in∣fluence,
obtained a grant of this country
from Charles the First, until which time
it had been considered as a part of Virgi∣nia
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The royal grant was given on this singular condi∣tion, that the proprietary should annually present, at Windsor Castle, two Indian arrows.</NOTE>. The Roman Catholics were, at
that period, greatly harrassed by the Puri∣tans,
who were then beginning to become
the predominant party; and to secure
them an asylum, where they might safely
<PB N="41" REF="89"/>
profess their religious tenets, was the mo∣tive
which induced the above nobleman
to solicit the grant. Accordingly, in the
following year, about two hundred fami∣lies,
of that persuasion, some of whom
were of considerable distinction, embarked
from Ireland for this newly acquired ter∣ritory,
where they were favourably receiv∣ed
by the Indian inhabitants, whose affec∣tion
they had the good fortune to conci∣liate
by the liberality of their conduct; in∣somuch
that they were soon enabled to pur∣chase
extensive tracts on the most moderate
terms, and to settle their lands to the best
advantage, without entertaining any anxi∣ous
apprehensions from the original pos∣sessors.</P>
<P>During the existence of that illegal
power, which had subverted the ancient
constitution both in church and state, the
proprietor of Maryland was deprived of
<PB N="42" REF="90"/>
his authority and his property; and a go∣vernor,
appointed by the protector, was
substituted in his stead: but at the restora∣tion
the property of the province reverted
to its natural possessor; Lord Baltimore
was reinstated in his privileges; and quick∣ly
demonstrated, by his distinguished con∣duct,
that he had every claim which me∣rit
and justice could afford. He instituted
a perfect toleration with respect to religion.
He gave the utmost encouragement to agri∣culture
and to commerce. In consequence
of his judicious exertions, the colony in∣creased
rapidly in wealth and population,
and persons of all denominations, attracted
by the moderation and equity of his go∣vernment,
were emulous to obtain set∣lements
under so flourishing and respec∣table
an establishment.</P>
<P>At the demise of Charles the Second, a
weak, arbitrary, and tyrannical monarch
<PB N="43" REF="91"/>
succeeded to the throne; during whose short,
but pernicious administration, this noble
family were again deprived of their posses∣sion,
which had been derived from royal
bounty, and had been wonderfully improv∣ed,
at the expence of infinite labour and
proportionable disbursements. They were,
however, again reinstated, in consequence
of that glorious revolution which establish∣ed
the British constitution on a firm unal∣terable
basis.</P>
<P>Though, by this ever-memorable event,
the proprietor was restored to the profits
of the government, yet the right of go∣verning
could not, consistently, under the
new system, be conferred on a Roman Ca∣tholic;
therefore, until the family renounc∣ed
that communion, the crown assumed
the power of appointing the supreme ma∣gistrate.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="92"/>
Lord Baltimore, the present proprietor,
has a right to exercise in his own person,
all the executive offices of government;
and in his absence to nominate one to that
department, with the consent and appro∣bation
of his majesty.</P>
<P>The present governor, who married his
eldest sister, was elevated to that situation,
a few months before my arrival in the
country.</P>
<P>Maryland is divided into fourteen coun∣ties,
seven on the western, and seven on
the eastern side of the bay, each of which
sends four representatives to the general as∣sembly.
The city of Annapolis has like∣wise
the privilege of delegating two. These
gentlemen form the lower house, and, if
I may compare small things to great,
possess similar powers with the commons
in the British parliament. The council, is
<PB N="45" REF="93"/>
composed of ten members, who are nomi∣nated
by the governor: they have the appel∣lation
of honourable, and with them he is
to advise in all matters respecting the gene∣ral
interests of the community. During
the sitting of the assembly, they become a
superior branch of the legislature, and their
confirmation is essential to the passing of
all laws.</P>
<P>The governor is, in every particular,
the representative of the Crown. He ap∣points
the time for the sitting of both
Houses; his assent is necessary for the con∣firmation
of their proceedings; and he pro∣rogues
or dissolves them, as appears to him
most consistent with the authority of Go∣vernment,
and the interests of the people.</P>
<P>I have previously observed, that Mary∣land
was originally settled by a colony of
Roman Catholicks, who emigrated from
<PB N="46" REF="94"/>
Ireland early in the last century, under
the patronage of the then Lord Baltimore.
For some time the inhabitants of that per∣suasion
maintained the entire ascendancy;
but their numbers are at present very in∣considerable,
and their influence of no
weight in the public concerns of the pro∣vince.
They, however, continue to be
tolerated, without being permitted to par∣ticipate
in the offices of government. The
established religion is that of the church
of England, the members of which com∣munion
very greatly exceed the aggregate
body of the dissenters of every denomi∣nation.</P>
<P>The province is divided into forty-four
parishes, many of which are populous and
extensive. The patronage is solely vested
in the governor, who is thereby enabled to
provide, in an ample manner, for many
worthy and respectable characters; and
<PB N="47" REF="95"/>
when all circumstances are taken into con∣sideration,
the clergy in this part of the
world, will be found to possess advantages
greatly superior to the generality of their
brethren in the mother country. Plurali∣ties
have never been admitted, the colo∣nists
being universally prepossessed against
that practice; and to attempt such an in∣novation,
would excite ferments of a dan∣gerous
nature. Each incumbent has a
neat and convenient habitation, with a
sufficient quantity of land, in proper culti∣vation
to answer every useful and domestic
purpose; and the emoluments arising from
the least beneficial preferment, are amply
sufficient to support an appearance, per∣fectly
consistent with the respectability of
the clerical profession. The holders of
church benefices are also happily exempted
from the frequent altercations, which una∣voidably
take place in the mother country,
on account of the collection of tythes.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="96"/>
By the laws of this province, all public
dues are levied by a poll-tax. The clergy,
from this provision, are entitled to forty
pounds of Tobacco for every person within
a limited age, at the rate of twelve shil∣lings
and six-pence the hundred weight.
Persons who plant Tobacco have it in
their option to pay either in money or in
produce; those who do not, are constantly
assessed in specie. A list of the taxables,
properly authenticated, is delivered to the
sheriff of each county, who collects the
clerical revenues, with other public claims;
and deducting a moderate commission for
transacting this concern, the residue is paid
with regularity and dispatch, to the respec∣tive
incumbents.</P>
<P>As the emoluments of benefices in∣crease,
in proportion to the increase of
inhabitants, many benefices in this go∣vernment
are rapidly advancing in value,
<PB N="49" REF="97"/>
and must, before many years elapse, very
greatly exceed the present annual amount.
Frederick County, which is considerably the
most extensive in this province, in its pre∣sent
state, is only divided into two parishes,
one of which, denominated All Saints, I
am credibly informed is, at this period, esti∣mated
at full one thousand pounds sterling,
<HI>per annum;</HI> and from the great increase
of population, which is daily taking place
in that beautiful and fertile country,
it will, very probably, soon produce an
income little inferior to many English
bishopricks.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive on what principle the
colonists are so strongly prejudiced against
the introduction of the episcopal order:
such an establishment would assuredly be
attended with many local advantages, and
save much trouble and expense to gentlemen
<PB N="50" REF="98"/>
educated in America for the sacred func∣tion,
who, on the present system, are under
the necessity of taking a voyage to England
for the purpose of ordination. Through∣out
the southern provinces, the members
of the established church greatly exceed
those of all other denominations; yet I
am persuaded, any attempt to establish an
hierarchy, would be resisted with as much
acrimony as during the gloomy prevalence
of puritanical zeal. This spirit of oppo∣sition,
to a measure so evidently condu∣cive
to the general good, is the more ex∣traordinary,
as the inhabitants of this part
of America discover, on every possible oc∣casion,
an enlarged and liberal disposition.
They have, however, conceived such rooted
prejudices against the higher orders of the
church, that they are positively persuaded
the advantages to be acquired, by such
an institution in the colonies, would by no
<PB N="51" REF="99"/>
means counter-balance the evils which
might arise from it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The establishment of episcopacy in America, since the conclusion of the war, is among those very extra∣ordinary circumstances which cannot be accounted for by human penetration.</P>
<P>While the colonies were a part of the British empire, the introduction of dignitaries was opposed with a most determined spirit, from an opinion, generally conceived, that the powers they would be authorised to exercise, might eventually be subversive of freedom; but when they were entirely at liberty to adopt any regulations for ecclesiastical government, totally independent of the mo∣ther country, they voluntarily and unanimously solicited the consecration of bishops.</P>
<P>About three years since, two clergymen, one from New York, and the other from Philadelphia, arrived in England, and received episcopal consecration. An act of Parliament had previously passed, for the purpose of dispensing with the oaths to the British government, in the case of those gentlemen, and in all similar cases. They were properly recommended hither, by a conven∣tion of the clergy in the United States of America; and another of their brethren, sanctioned in like manner from Virginia, has been lately consecrated here, as bishop for that state, under the forementioned authority. So that there are three bishops now in that country, who will have full power to continue the uninterrupted succes∣sion, which has existed from the days of the apostles; not to mention a gentleman who, a considerable time before the others, had been consecrated by the non-jur∣ing bishops in Scotland, and who resides in Connecticut. None of these, however, have any fixed income, but depend upon the voluntary contributions of their respec∣tive congregations, to whom they regularly preach on sundays, and officiate as parish priests. They have the title of <HI>Right Reverend,</HI> but have no particular powers, except that of ordaining deacons and priests, and superin∣tending the religious and moral conduct of the clergy, who are, in some sort, rendered accountable to them. It is, I believe, generally allowed, that the members of the episcopal church increase, throughout all the States, beyond any other denomination, although they are nearly upon an equality with the others, respecting the privileges from the civil power. In British America, there is a bi∣shop, chiefly resident in Nova Scotia, who has much the same distinction with those already particularised; but enjoys an established salary of about eleven hundred pounds sterling a year.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a political point of view, indepen∣dent
of religious motives, it is much to
be lamented, that a plan of this nature was
not determined on, before the colonies had
arrived to their present degree of popula∣tion
<PB N="52" REF="100"/>
and consequence: had an order of
nobility been created, and dignitaries in
the church appointed at an early period, it
would most assuredly have greatly tended
to cherish a steady adherence to monar∣chical
principles; and have more strongly
<PB N="53" REF="101"/>
rivetted the attachment of the colonies
to the parent state. Inattention to prin∣ciples
of such importance, has gradu∣ally
given birth to sentiments totally re∣pugnant
to the genius of our most excel∣lent
constitution. A republican spirit ap∣pears
<PB N="54" REF="102"/>
generally to predominate; and it will
undoubtedly require the utmost exertion
of legislative wisdom, to establish on a per∣manent
basis, the future political and com∣mercial
connexion between Great Britain
and America.</P>
<P>There are many discerning and intel∣ligent
persons, who are decidedly of opi∣nion
that the acquisition of Canada is
highly prejudicial to the interests of the
mother country. The Americans are, by
this event, relieved from continual appre∣hensions;
their frontiers are no longer ex∣posed
to the incursions of a restless enter∣prising
neighbour; and they begin to en∣courage
ideas of self-importance, which
have been wonderfully promoted by the
success attending their recent opposition to
the operation of the stamp duties.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="103"/>
Had Canada still continued annexed to
the French empire, it is evident that the
British provinces, from a well-grounded
dread of such numerous and powerful op∣ponents,
must unavoidably, on a principle
of self-preservation, if not of affection, have
remained firmly and indissolubly attached to
the parent state: a just apprehension of
real calamities would have operated with
efficacy against imaginary evils; and the
natural and constitutional dependence of
the colonies, on the protection and assist∣ance
of Great Britain, would have pro∣moted
a constant and mutual interchange
of friendly and benevolent offices, which
must have settled the union on a perma∣nent
foundation, and on terms reciprocally
honourable and advantageous to both coun∣tries.</P>
<P>What will be the event of the present
discontents, which, I am truly concerned
<PB N="56" REF="104"/>
to observe, are universally predominant,
time alone can determine. There are
amongst us, many restless spirits, who are
evidently industrious in fomenting divi∣sions,
and exciting jealousies; and unless
wise and constitutional measures are imme∣diately
adopted, there is too much reason
to apprehend consequences of a serious and
alarming nature.</P>
<P>You will think, and with great justice,
that I have ventured far beyond my depth,
in presuming to descant on such important
topics; but remember it was you who
started the game; I have only, like an un∣skilful
rider, followed an irresistible im∣pulse,
and if I retain but my seat on the
saddle, I shall be amply satisfied.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 8th, 1770.</DATE></P>
<P>THOUGH we are yet far behind the
mother country, with respect to cul∣tivation
and improvements, yet, in a com∣parative
view, Maryland may boast consi∣derable
advantages. The inhabitants are
enterprising and industrious; commerce
and agriculture are encouraged; and every
circumstance clearly evinces, that this co∣lony
is making a rapid progress to wealth,
power, and population.</P>
<P>Provisions of every kind, are excellent
and plentiful; and the Chesapeak, with
our numerous rivers, affords a surprising
variety of excellent fish. Poultry, and
wild-fowl, abound amongst the humble
<PB N="58" REF="106"/>
cottagers; and beef, mutton, pork, and
other provisions, are at least equal to the
production of the best British markets.</P>
<P>Deer, a few years since, were very nu∣merous
in the interiour settlements; but,
from the unfair methods adopted by the
hunters, their numbers are exceedingly
diminished. These people, whose only mo∣tive
was to procure the hide of the animal,
were dextrous, during the winter season, in
tracing their path through the snow; and
from the animal's incapacity to exert speed,
under such circumstances, great multi∣tudes
of them were annually slaughtered,
and their carcases left in the woods. This
practice, however, has been thought wor∣thy
the attention of the legislature, and an
act of assembly has taken place, laying se∣vere
penalties on “persons detected in
pursuing or destroying deer, within a
limited term;” and it is probable, the
<PB N="59" REF="107"/>
apprehension of punishment may very
greatly restrain, if not totally eradicate an
evil founded on cruelty and rapacity.</P>
<P>In England, almost every country is dis∣tinguished
by a peculiar dialect; even dif∣ferent
habits, and different modes of think∣ing,
evidently discriminate inhabitants,
whose local situation is not far remote:
but in Maryland, and throughout the adja∣cent
provinces, it is worthy of observation,
that a striking similarity of speech uni∣versally
prevails; and it is strictly true, that
the pronunciation of the generality of the
people has an accuracy and elegance, that
cannot fail of gratifying the most judicious
ear.</P>
<P>The colonists are composed of adventu∣rers,
not only from every district of Great
Britain and Ireland, but from almost every
other European government, where the
<PB N="60" REF="108"/>
principles of liberty and commerce have
operated with spirit and efficacy. Is it not,
therefore, reasonable to suppose, that the
English language must be greatly corrupted
by such a strange intermixture of various
nations? The reverse is, however, true.
The language of the immediate descendants
of such a promiscuous ancestry is perfectly
uniform, and unadulterated; nor has it bor∣rowed
any provincial, or national accent,
from its British or foreign parentage.</P>
<P>For my part, I confess myself totally at
a loss to account for the apparent diffe∣rence,
between the colonists and persons
under equal circumstances of education
and fortune, resident in the mother coun∣try.
This uniformity of language pre∣vails
not only on the coast, where Euro∣peans
form a considerable mass of the peo∣ple,
but likewise in the interior parts,
where population has made but slow ad∣vances;
<PB N="61" REF="109"/>
and where opportunities seldom
occur to derive any great advantages from
an intercourse with intelligent strangers.</P>
<P>You, my friend, are seated at the foun∣tain
head of literary and political intelli∣gence,
and from you I shall expect fre∣quent,
and circumstantial communications.
Most sincerely do I wish you may be en∣abled
to acquaint me, that the first trans∣action
in the ensuing sessions of parliament,
is a total repeal of acts, which are never
likely to be productive of any considerable
revenue; and which are esteemed in this
country, to have no other tendency but to
enforce claims, which the colonists univer∣sally
consider as impoliti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unconstitu∣tional.
How far their sentiments are justly
founded, I am by no means competent to
determine; but it is a certain fact, that the
statute imposing duties on glass, paper, and
tea, has undermined the foundation of that
<PB N="62" REF="110"/>
cordiality, which the repeal of the stamp
act had happily re-established; and it is
with the utmost concern, I am necessi∣tated
to acquaint you, that a spirit of dis∣content
and opposition is universally pre∣dominant
in the colonies.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 14th.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM sure you will take a sincere part
in the happiness I now experience. My

of domestic life. With their affec∣tionate
wishes, believe me, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sept. 20, 1770.</DATE></P>
<P>YOUR information relative to the
situation of servants in this country,
is far from being well-founded. I have
now been upwards of twelve months re∣sident
in Maryland, and am thereby en∣abled
to convey to you a tolerable idea on
this subject.</P>
<P>Persons in a state of servitude are under
four distinct denominations: negroes, who
are the entire property of their respective
owners: convicts, who are transported
from the mother country for a limited
term: indented servants, who are engaged
for five years previous to their leaving Eng∣land;
and free-willers, who are supposed,
<PB N="64" REF="112"/>
from their situation, to possess superior ad∣vantages.</P>
<P>The negroes in this province are, in
general, natives of the country; very few
in proportion being imported from the
coast of Africa. They are better cloathed,
better fed, and better treated, than their
unfortunate brethren, whom a more rigid
fate hath subjected to slavery in our West
India islands; neither are their employ∣ments
so laborious, nor the acts of the
legislature so partially oppressive against
them. The further we proceed to the
northward, the less number of people are
to be found of this complexion: In the
New England government, negroes are al∣most
as scarce as on your side of the At∣lantic,
and but few are under actual sla∣very;
but as we advance to the south, their
multitudes astonishingly increase, and in
<PB N="65" REF="113"/>
the Carolinas they considerably exceed the
number of white inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding the climate of North America is less favourable to the constitution of negroes than the European settlements in the Torrid Zone, they never∣theless increase rapidly in almost every part of that ex∣tensive continent. The last importation of slaves into Maryland was, as I am credibly informed, in the year 1769; and though great losses have been sustained in con∣sequence of the war, and desertions to the British stand∣ard, their numbers are at least doubted since that time, without any foreign supply. To account for a cir∣cumstance, apparently so improbable, it must be ob∣served, that on the American continent, the planters ge∣nerally adopted a more liberal mode in their African in∣tercourse, than has been pursued in the islands. They did not import slaves for the supply of foreign settlements, but purchased for their own immediate use, without any particular preference to either sex. The consequence is obvious, they have multiplied in a due proportion, and notwithstanding the occasional severity of the cli∣mate, and the recent calamities of war, their numbers are fully sufficient for their respective occupations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="114"/>
Maryland is the only province into which
convicts may be freely imported. The
Virginians have inflicted very severe penal∣ties
on any masters of vessels, or others,
who may attempt to introduce persons un∣der
this description into their colony. They
have been influenced in this measure by
an apprehension, that, from the admission
of such inmates into their families, the
prevalence of bad example might tend to
universal depravity, in spite of every regu∣lation,
and restraining law.</P>
<P>Persons convicted of felony, and in con∣sequence
transported to this continent, if
they are able to pay the expence of pas∣sage,
are free to pursue their fortune agree∣ably
to their inclinations or abilities. Few,
however, have means to avail themselves
of this advantage. These unhappy beings
are, generally, consigned to an agent, who
classes them suitably to their real or sup∣posed
<PB N="67" REF="115"/>
qualifications; advertises them for
sale, and disposes of them, for seven years,
to planters, to mechanics, and to such
as choose to retain them for domestic ser∣vice.
Those who survive the term of
servitude, seldom establish their residence
in this country: the stamp of infamy is
too strong upon them to be easily erased:
they either return to Europe, and renew
their former practices; or, if they have
fortunately imbibed habits of honesty and
industry, they remove to a distant situa∣tion,
where they may hope to remain un∣known,
and be enabled to pursue with
credit every possible method of becoming
useful members of society.</P>
<P>In your frequent excursions about the
great metropolis, you cannot but observe
numerous advertisements, offering the most
seducing encouragement to adventurers
under every possible description; to those
<PB N="68" REF="116"/>
who are disgusted with the frowns of for∣tune
in their native land; and to those
of an enterprising disposition, who are
tempted to court her smiles in a distant
region. These persons are referred to
agents, or crimps, who represent the ad∣vantages
to be obtained in America, in
colours so alluring, that it is almost im∣possible
to resist their artifices. Unwary
persons are accordingly induced to enter
into articles, by which they engage to be∣come
servants, agreeable to their respective
qualifications, for the term of five years;
every necessary accommodation being found
them during the voyage; and every me∣thod
taken that they may be treated
with tenderness and humanity during the
period of servitude; at the expiration of
which they are taught to expect, that op∣portunities
will assuredly offer to secure to
the honest and industrious, a competent
provision for the remainder of their days.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="117"/>
The generality of the inhabitants in this
province are very little acquainted with
those fallacious pretences, by which num∣bers
are continually induced to embark for
this continent. On the contrary, they
too generally conceive an opinion that
the difference is merely nominal between
the indented servant and the convicted
felon: nor will they readily believe that
people, who had the least experience in
life, and whose characters were unexcep∣tionable,
would abandon their friends and
families, and their ancient connexions, for
a servile situation, in a remote appen∣dage
to the British Empire. From this
persuasion they rather consider the con∣vict
as the more profitable servant, his
term being for seven, the latter only for
five years; and, I am sorry to observe,
that there are but few instances wherein
they experience different treatment. Ne∣groes
being a property for life, the death
<PB N="70" REF="118"/>
of slaves, in the prime of youth or strength,
is a material loss to the proprietor; they
are, therefore, almost in every instance, un∣der
more comfortable circumstances than
the miserable European, over whom the
rigid planter exercises an inflexible seve∣rity.
They are strained to the utmost to
perform their allotted labour; and, from
a prepossession in many cases too justly
founded, they are supposed to be receiv∣ing
only the just reward which is due to
repeated offences. There are doubtless
many exceptions to this observation, yet,
generally speaking, they groan beneath a
worse than Egyptian bondage. By at∣tempting
to lighten the intolerable bur∣then,
they often render it more insup∣portable.
For real, or imaginary causes,
these frequently attempt to escape, but
very few are successful; the country
being intersected with rivers, and the ut∣most
vigilance observed in detecting per∣sons
<PB N="71" REF="119"/>
under suspicious circumstances, who,
when apprehended, are committed to close
confinement, advertised, and delivered to
their respective masters; the party who
detects the vagrant being entitled to a re∣ward.
Other incidental charges arise. The
unhappy culprit is doomed to a severe chas∣tisement;
and a prolongation of servitude
is decreed in full proportion to expences
incurred, and supposed inconveniences re∣sulting
from a desertion of duty.</P>
<P>The situation of the free-willer is, in
almost every instance, more to be lament∣ed
than either that of the convict or the
indented servant; the deception which is
practised on those of this description being
attended with circumstances of greater du∣plicity
and cruelty. Persons under this
denomination are received under express
conditions that, on their arrival in Ame∣rica,
they are to be allowed a stipulated
<PB N="72" REF="120"/>
number of days to dispose of themselves to
the greatest advantage. They are told, that
their services will be eagerly solicited, in
proportion to their abilities; that their re∣ward
will be adequate to the hazard they
encounter by courting fortune in a distant
region; and that the parties with whom
they engage will readily advance the sum
agreed on for their passage; which, being
averaged at about nine pounds sterling,
they will speedily be enabled to repay, and
to enjoy, in a state of liberty, a compara∣tive
situation of case and affluence.</P>
<P>With these pleasing ideas they support,
with cheerfulness, the hardships to which
they are subjected during the voyage; and,
with the most anxious sensations of de∣light,
approach the land which they con∣sider
as the scene of future prosperity. But
scarce have they contemplated the diversi∣fied
objects which naturally attract atten∣tion;
<PB N="73" REF="121"/>
scarce have they yielded to the pleas∣ing
reflection, that every danger, every
difficulty, is happily surmounted, before
their fond hopes are cruelly blasted, and they
find themselves involved in all the com∣plicated
miseries of a tedious, laborious,
and unprofitable servitude.</P>
<P>Persons resident in America, being ac∣customed
to procure servants for a very
trifling consideration, under absolute terms,
for a limited period, are not often disposed
to hire adventurers, who expect to be gra∣tified
in full proportion to their acknow∣ledged
qualifications; but, as they sup∣port
authority with a rigid hand, they little
regard the former situation of their unhap∣py
dependants.</P>
<P>This disposition, which is almost uni∣versally
prevalent, is well known to the
parties, who on your side of the Atlantic
<PB N="74" REF="122"/>
engage in this iniquitous and cruel com∣merce.
It is, therefore, an article of
agreement with these deluded victims, that
if they are not successful in obtaining situ∣ations,
on their own terms, within a cer∣tain
number of days after their arrival in
the country, they are then to be sold, in
order to defray the charges of passage, at
the discretion of the master of the vessel,
or the agent to whom he is consigned in
the province.</P>
<P>You are also to observe, that servants
imported, even under this favourable de∣scription,
are rarely permitted to set their
feet on shore, until they have absolutely
formed their respective engagements. As
soon as the ship is stationed in her birth,
planters, mechanics, and others, repair on
board; the adventurers of both sexes are
exposed to view, and very few are happy
enough to make their own stipulations,
<PB N="75" REF="123"/>
some very extraordinary qualifications be∣ing
absolutely requisite to obtain this
distinction; and even when this is ob∣tained,
the advantages are by no means
equivalent to their sanguine expectations.
The residue, stung with disappointment
and vexation, meet with horror the mo∣ment
which dooms them, under an ap∣pearance
of equity, to a limited term of
slavery. Character is of little importance;
their abilities not being found of a supe∣rior
nature, they are sold as soon as their
term of election is expired, apparel and
provision being their only compensation;
till, on the expiration of five tedious labo∣rious
years, they are restored to a dearly
purchased freedom.</P>
<P>From this detail, I am persuaded, you
will no longer imagine, that the servants
in this country are in a better situation than
those in Britain. You have heard of con∣victs
<PB N="76" REF="124"/>
who rather chose to undergo the se∣verest
penalties of the law, than endure the
hardships which are annexed to their situ∣ation,
during a state of servitude on this
side the Atlantic. Indolence, accompanied
with a train of vicious habits, has, doubtless,
great influence on the determination of
such unhappy wretches; but it is surely
to be lamented that men, whose charac∣ters
are unblemished, whose views are
founded on honest and industrious princi∣ples,
should fall a sacrifice to avarice and
delusion, and indiscriminately be blended
with the most profligate and abandoned of
mankind.</P>
<P>It seems astonishing, that a circumstance
so well known, particularly in this pro∣vince,
should not have been generally cir∣culated
through every part of the British
Empire. Were the particulars of this ini∣quitous
traffic universally divulged, those
<PB N="77" REF="125"/>
who have established offices in London,
and in the principal sea-ports, for the re∣gular
conduct of this business, would be
pointed out to obloquy, and their punish∣ment
would serve as a beacon to deter the
ignorant and unwary from becoming vic∣tims
to the insidious practices of avarice
and deceit.</P>
<P>I am ready to admit there is every ap∣pearance
of candour on the part of the
agents, and their accomplices. Previous
to the embarcation of any person under
the respective agreements, the parties re∣gularly
comply with the requisitions of
a law, wisely calculated to prevent clan∣destine
transportation; they appear before
a magistrate, and give their voluntary
assent to the obligations they have mu∣tually
entered into. But are not such ad∣venturers
induced to this measure in con∣sequence
of ignorance and misrepresenta∣tion?
Assuredly they are. They are in∣dustriously
<PB N="78" REF="126"/>
taught to expect advantages in∣finitely
superior to their most sanguine views
in Britain. Every lucrative incentive is
delineated in the most flattering colours;
and they fondly expect to acquire that in∣dependence
in the revolution of a few years,
which the longest life could not promise,
with the exertion of their best abilities, in
the bosom of their native country.</P>
<P>I will relieve your attention from this
painful subject, by relating an anecdote of
an interesting nature, with which I be∣came
acquainted soon after my arrival in
these parts.</P>
<P>A gentleman of considerable influence
and fortune, purchased a servant as an as∣sistant
to his gardener; having been pre∣viously
informed that he had originally act∣ed
in that capacity, and was qualified for
the undertaking. The man, soon after he
<PB N="79" REF="127"/>
was brought on shore, received instructions
to enter on his business, when it was im∣mediately
discovered, that he was wholly
unacquainted with the nature of his em∣ployment.
On being interrogated relative
to this deception, he acquainted his master,
that “extreme indigence induced him to
abandon his native country—that in the
course of the voyage, having intimated
that he had not been brought up to any
mechanical profession, he was inform∣ed
by the captain, it was absolutely ne∣cessary
he should avow some particular
calling, in order to secure a more com∣fortable
situation; that in America, a
competent skill in gardening was easily
attainable, and seldom required the ex∣ertion
of greater talents than what
were immediately essential for domestic
purposes; and that by engaging in
such employment, he might avoid a
more laborious servitude, under the
<PB N="80" REF="128"/>
discipline of some rigid and inflexible
planter.”</P>
<P>This declaration was delivered in terms
so apparently consistent with truth, as ob∣tained
entire credit with his master, who
from his deportment, and exterior, was
likewise induced to form sentiments much
to his advantage: he therefore determined
to receive him into his family, in the capa∣city
of a domestic, and to give him that en∣couragement,
to which he might be entitled
by the propriety of his future conduct.</P>
<P>Every sentiment of gratitude appeared
to operate on the mind of the servant,
when he found himself destined to a station
more comfortable than his original allot∣ment;
and, for some time, the whole te∣nor
of his actions was such as might shew,
that he highly merited the indulgence
which he had so unexpectedly obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="129"/>
For a few months his diligence and at∣tention
secured him the entire appro∣bation
of his master, and he was conti∣nually
gaining ground on his confidence
and esteem. It was, therefore, with the
utmost concern, his benefactor began to
observe an appearance of discontent, a dis∣regard
to the duties of his station, and an
evident alteration in every particular. Re∣monstrances
and threats were equally in∣effectual:
his disposition became sullen, and
reserved; while he obstinately refused to as∣sign
any cause for such an obvious change
in his conduct. At length, he quitted
the house of his benevolent employer, and
by travelling in the night, and lying con∣cealed
in the day, he took the proper pre∣cautions
to elude the vigilance of pursuit.</P>
<P>His plan, though well concerted, was,
nevertheless, ineffectual. In a few days
he was discovered, almost famished. Ne∣cessity
<PB N="82" REF="130"/>
compelled him to supplicate the aid
of charity: his story was equivocal, and
excited suspicion; he obtained relief, but
with the detention of his person. A ma∣gistrate,
before whom he was conveyed,
threatened him with confinement and ri∣gorous
treatment, unless he gave a proper
and satisfactory account from whence he
came, and the circumstances which had
reduced him to his present situation. Find∣ing
every fallacious pretext fruitless, he
made a candid and explicit discovery, and
was, in consequence, with all possible ex∣pedition,
conducted to the presence of a
master, whose tenderness he had basely
returned
with such unpardonable ingra∣titude.</P>
<P>The most compassionate nature is sel∣dom
proof against repeated instances of
an incorrigible disposition. It was there∣fore
thought necessary that he should ex∣perience
<PB N="83" REF="131"/>
the consequences of his behavi∣our,
but he was previously reminded of the
repeated acts of kindness that had been
shown him, and the ungrateful return the
had made. From such considerations it
was observed, that it was a debt strictly
due to justice to compel him to serve
the residue of his time in the most labori∣ous
employment allotted to worthless ser∣vants.
He was accordingly sentenced to
the iron mines, there to reap the bitter
effects of his conduct.</P>
<P>Overwhelmed with the consciousness of
guilt, and terrified at the prospect of the
punishment that awaited him, the un∣fortunate
culprit, in the most ingenuous
terms, confessed the equity of the sentence
passed upon him, but not without an inti∣mation,
that there were circumstances in
his case which, were they known, he was
persuaded, would plead powerfully in his
<PB N="84" REF="132"/>
behalf. An irresistable inclination to re∣turn
to his native country, and the obsta∣cles
which appeared to bar his delusive
hopes, had possessed his mind with that
gloom and discontent, which had almost
obliterated the impressions of gratitude, and
occasioned that conduct which had brought
him into his present situation. He con∣cluded
by declaring, that he had not the
most distant claim to compassion, yet rely∣ing
on that goodness and lenity which he
had so frequently abused, he was encou∣raged
to admit a ray of hope, and to sup∣plicate
forgiveness, however undeserved.</P>
<P>His humane master heard him with the
most candid attention. He pitied a devia∣tion
from rectitude, which originated in
motives natural to the human mind; and
determined not only to exempt him from
the situation to which he had been justly
doomed, but to send him, by an early op∣portunity,
to his much loved native coun∣try,
<PB N="85" REF="133"/>
there to pursue such eligible methods
as Providence might suggest for his fu∣ture
comfortable provision. I shall not
attempt to delineate the transports which
on this intimation took possession of his
mind.</P>
<P>About this time, the captain of a ship
preparing to sail for England, signified his
want of a steward to attend on those pas∣sengers
who had engaged his cabin for the
voyage: the emancipated servant was re∣commended
for this employment; his ser∣vices
were accepted; and with solemn
assurances of the most lasting and grateful
attachment, he bade farewel to a master,
by whose generous, disinterested conduct,
he was so providentially restored to happi∣ness
and to liberty.</P>
<P>Two years elapsed without the least in∣telligence
respecting his situation, when, at
length, a letter arrived, filled with every
<PB N="86" REF="134"/>
sentiment of gratitude. “His sense of
repeated obligations was acknowledg∣ed
in terms which delineated a heart
conscious of the important benefits he
had experienced; and he concluded by
entreating his late master's acceptance
of a bill, as a trifling consideration for
the residue of that time, which he had
been so generously and humanely ex∣empted
from serving.”</P>
<P>The sum remitted, very greatly exceeded
the original cost of the most valuable ser∣vant.
In this epistle, not the least inti∣mation
was given, relative to the circum∣stance
which had enabled a man, so lately
at the lowest ebb of misery, to spare from
his immediate occasions, so considerable a
sum as <HI>thirty pounds;</HI> but an answer was
requested, to be addressed to a merchant in
London, that the party concerned might
be properly apprized his bill was received
and acknowledged.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="135"/>
Mr. I—was inexpressibly happy in the
pleasing reflection, that, by an indulgence
of lenity, natural to his disposition, he had
been rendered by Heaven the instrument
of such unexpected prosperity. He could
not, for a moment, admit the idea of ap∣propriating
any part of such money to him∣self,
as the payment of a debt▪ which
he considered as a free donation to the
claims of humanity; but he was naturally
anxious to become acquainted with the par∣ticular
events by which his late servant was
so happily situated as to obtain the power
of transmitting such a proof of his ho∣nesty
and gratitude. He, therefore, im∣mediately
addressed a letter to the merchant,
expressive of the “satisfaction he expe∣rienced
in receiving intelligence of such
an agreeable nature, and desiring him
to return the note, which he had en∣closed
for that purpose, into the hands
of the party who had conceived it his”
<PB N="88" REF="136"/>
“duty to transmit it, with earnest wishes,
that his future successes might amply
compensate for every former calamity.
He had only to request, that by an early
opportunity, he would afford him the
satisfaction of knowing, by what un∣expected
circumstance he had been so
rapidly, and so providentially favoured
with the smiles of fortune.”</P>
<P>By the return of the first ship, an an∣swer
from the agent arrived. The bill was
sent back, with an earnest entreaty, that
if Mr. J—refused to apply it to his
particular occasions, he would appropriate
it to some charitable purpose: that with
respect to the situation of the man, for∣merly
his servant, there were powerful rea∣sons
which precluded him from giving
the information he requested. All that
he was at liberty to disclose was, that the
person who had visited America, under
<PB N="89" REF="137"/>
circumstances so desperate and forlorn;
who had been necessitated to become a
common indented servant, subject to all
the hardships and miseries incident to so
abject a condition, was, by an astonishing
transition of fortune, elevated to a very
affluent and respectable situation in his
native country.</P>
<P>The above particulars were delivered to
me by the benevolent master himself, who
during a course of years, has assiduously
endeavoured, by every eligible mode of
inquiry, to develop a secret so industri∣ously
concealed from his knowledge: but
every method has hitherto proved ineffec∣tual;
and he has now relinquished the idea
of having so natural a curiosity, even con∣fidentially
gratified.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 18, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>YOU observe, that in the course of
my correspondence, I have not par∣ticularly
mentioned any towns of conse∣quence,
within the limits of this govern∣ment.
In all probability, from the mul∣titude
of rivers which, with their branches,
intersect this country in almost every direc∣tion,
Maryland will never abound with
ports, or establishments of any considera∣ble
magnitude. By the advantage of so
many navigable waters, an opportunity is
afforded to ship the produce of many ex∣tensive
districts, even at the doors of the
respective planters; who, consequently,
have not that inducement, common to
most countries, for establishing themselves
in populous communities.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="139"/>
Frederick County alone, from its inte∣rior
situation, appears precluded from this
benefit. But should a plan, now in agi∣tation,
to remove the obstructions in the
great river Patowmac, be attended with
the desired consequences, that very fer∣tile
and extensive country will, in a
great measure, participate in the advan∣tages
which are common to the other parts
of the province.</P>
<P>On the arrival of Lord Baltimore, the
original proprietor, with those families
who had emigrated under the grant which
he had obtained from the Crown, the first
establishment was formed on the northern
shore of the Patowmac. The bounds
of a town were ascertained; temporary
habitations were erected; and this place,
which was destined to be the seat of go∣vernment,
was distinguished by the name
of St. Mary's Town. But in process of
<PB N="92" REF="140"/>
time, that situation at the southern extre∣mity
of the province, was considered to
be inconvenient for the dispatch of public
business; and another spot more central
was selected, which appeared to possess
every possible advantage. Proper encou∣ragement
was given to promote popula∣tion;
a charter of incorporation was ob∣tained;
and the new metropolis, in ho∣nour
of the then reigning monarch, re∣ceived
the appellation of Annapolis.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I attempted to con∣vey
some idea of the truly picturesque and
beautiful situation of our little capital. Se∣veral
of the most opulent families have
here established their residence; and hos∣pitality
is the characteristic of the inhabi∣tants.
Party prejudices have little influ∣ence
on social intercourse: the grave and
ancient enjoy the blessings of a respectable
<PB N="93" REF="141"/>
society, while the young and gay have va∣rious
amusements to engage their hours of
relaxation, and to promote that mutual
connexion so essential to their future hap∣piness.</P>
<P>You well know, that I have ever been
strongly attached to the rational enter∣tainment
resulting from theatrical exhibi∣tions.
When I bade farewel to England,
I little expected that my passion for the
drama could have been gratified, in any
tolerable degree, at a distance so remote
from the great mart of genius; and I
brought with me strong prepossessions in be∣half
of favourite performers, whose merits
were fully established, by the universal sanc∣tion
of intelligent judges. My pleasure and
my surprise were therefore excited in propor∣tion,
on finding performers in this country
equal, at least, to those who sustain the best
of the first characters in your most celebrated
<PB N="94" REF="142"/>
provincial theatres. Our governor, from a
strong conviction that the stage, under pro∣per
regulations, may be rendered of general
utility, and made subservient to the great
interests of religion and virtue, patronizes
the American Company; and as their pre∣sent
place of exhibition is on a small scale,
and inconveniently situated, a subscrip∣tion,
by his example, has been rapidly com∣pleted
to errect a new theatre, on a com∣modious,
if not an elegant plan. The
manager is to deliver tickets for two sea∣sons,
to the amount of the respective sub∣scriptions;
and it is imagined, that the
money which will be received at the doors,
from non-subscribers, will enable him to
conduct the business without difficulty;
and when the limited number of perfor∣mances
is completed, the intire property
is to be vested in him. This will be a
valuable addition to our catalogue of amuse∣ments.
The building is already in a state
<PB N="95" REF="143"/>
of forwardness, and the day of opening is
anxiously expected. This circumstance
has carried me inadvertently from my pro∣per
subject. Give me pardon for the di∣gression.
I will return into the road from
which I deviated.</P>
<P>Annapolis, with every advantage to ren∣der
it an agreeable residence, labours under
inconveniences which will greatly impede
its progress to commercial importance.
The harbour, as I have formerly observed,
is not sufficiently commodious for vessels
of considerable burden; and the road is
too much exposed, to lade or unlade with
safety or convenience. But the province
has been amply compensated for this dis∣appointment,
by the rise of a settlement,
which in the memory of many persons now
in being, has increased with the most asto∣nishing
rapidity; and promises, by an equal
progress, to rank with the most populous
<PB N="96" REF="144"/>
and opulent establishments on this side the
Atlantic.</P>
<P>This place, which is named Baltimore,
in compliment to the proprietary-family,
is situated on the northern branch of the
river Patapsco, about thirty miles higher
up the bay of Chesapeak than Annapolis;
and at nearly the same distance by land.
Within these few years▪ some scattered cot∣tages
were only to be found on this spot,
occupied by obscure storekeepers, merely
for the supply of the adjacent plantations.
But the peculiar advantages it possesses,
with respect to the trade of the frontier
counties of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and
Maryland, so strongly impressed the mind
of Mr. John Stevenson, an Irish gentle∣man,
who had settled in the vicinity in a
medical capacity, that he first conceiv∣ed
the important project, of rendering
this port the grand emporium of Mary∣land
<PB N="97" REF="145"/>
commerce. He accordingly appli∣ed
himself, with assiduity, to the com∣pletion
of his plan. The neighbouring
country being fertile, well settled, and
abounding in grain; Mr. S—con∣tracted
for considerable quantities of wheat,
he freighted vessels, and consigned them to
a correspondent in his native country: the
cargoes sold to great advantage, and re∣turns
were made equally beneficial. The
commencement of a trade so lucrative to
the first adventurers, soon became an ob∣ject
of universal attention. Persons of a
commercial and enterprising spirit, emi∣grated
from all quarters to this new and
promising scene of industry. Wharfs were
constructed; elegant and convenient habi∣tations
were rapidly erected; marshes were
drained; spacious fields were occupied for
the purposes of general utility; and within
forty years, from its first commencement,
Baltimore became not only the most weal∣thy
<PB N="98" REF="146"/>
and populous town in the province,
but inferior to few on this continent, either
in size, number of inhabitants, or the ad∣vantages
arising from a well-conducted and
universal commercial connexion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soon after the appointment of Mr. Eden to the go∣vernment of Maryland, Sir William Draper arrived in that province, on a to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r throughout the continent. He contemplated the origin of Baltimore, and its rapid pro∣gress, with astonishment; and when introduced, by the governor, to the worthy founder, he elegantly accosted him by the appellation of the American Romulus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The third place of importance in the
province of Maryland, is situated about
seventy miles west of Annapolis, and is the
capital of a most extensive, fertile, and
populous county. Frederick Town is the
name of this settlement. Within fifty
years, the river Monocacy, about three
miles to the eastward, was the extreme
boundary of cultivated establishments; and
<PB N="99" REF="147"/>
Mr. D—, father to the present secre∣tary
of the province, was much consured
for having procured con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderable tracts of
lands, in the vicinity of that river, which
it was generally supposed could not even
repay the trifling charge of the purchase,
for many succeeding generations. The
richness of the soil, and the salubrity of
the air, operated, however, very power∣fully
to promote population; but what
chiefly tended to the advancement of set∣tlements
in this remote district, was the
arrival of many emigrants from the pala∣tinate,
and other Germanic States. These
people who, from their earliest days, had
been disciplined in habits of industry, so∣briety,
frugality, and patience, were pecu∣liarly
fitted for the laborious occupations of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling timber, clearing land, and forming
the first improvements; and the success
which attended their efforts, induced mul∣titudes
of their enterprising countrymen
<PB N="100" REF="148"/>
to abandon their native homes, to enjoy
the plenteous harvest which appeared to
await their labours in the wild, unculti∣vated
wastes of America.</P>
<P>The Germans were not the only people
sensible of the advantages to be derived
from establishments in this interior country.
Many British adventurers, and natives of
the coast, where land was becoming scarce
and difficult to be acquired, were equally
emulous on this occasion; and it is asto∣nishing
how soon extensive forests became
highly cultivated, and promising settle∣ments
began on all sides to extend them∣selves.</P>
<P>To supply the real and imaginary neces∣sities
of those, by whose persevering efforts,
and penetrating genius, immense unculti∣vated
tracts became flourishing establish∣ments,
storekeepers of various denomina∣tions
<PB N="101" REF="149"/>
were encouraged to pursue the path
which industry had pointed out. Ware∣houses
were accordingly erected, and
woollens, linnens, and implements of hus∣bandry,
were first presented to the view of
the laborious planter. As wealth and po∣pulation
increased, wants were created,
and many considerable demands, in conse∣quence,
took place for the various elegan∣cies,
as well as necessaries of life: and thus,
by imperceptible degrees, from an humble
beginning, has Frederick Town arisen to
its present flourishing state.</P>
<P>This place exceeds Annapolis in size,
and in the number of inhabitants. It con∣tains
one large and convenient church, for
the members of the established religion;
and several chapels for the accommodation
of the German and other dissenters. The
buildings, though mostly of wood, have a
neat and regular appearance. Provisions
<PB N="102" REF="150"/>
are cheap, plentiful, and excellent. In a
word, here are to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound all conveniences,
and many superfluities; a lucrative trade is
supported with the back country, and a
considerable quantity of grain is sent from
hence, by land carriage, to Baltimore, for
exportation to the European markets.</P>
<P>The above excepted, there are not any
towns of consequence in the province of
Maryland; the rest, which bear that de∣nomination,
are rather inconsiderable vil∣lages,
the residence of a few merchants
and storekeepers, with a sufficient assort∣ment
of goods for the supply of the neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P>Ship building, throughout this continent,
is a very lucrative and extensive branch
of business; and I am assured by many,
who are esteemed competent judges, that
American vessels are, in general, moulded
<PB N="103" REF="151"/>
in a very elegant and superior stile. The
immense quantity of useful timber to be
found, even on the banks of almost every
river, gives the shipwright peculiar ad∣vantages.
These vessels, when perfectly
completed, exclusive of particular decora∣tions,
are freighted with produce to some
British port, and are generally sold after
the delivery of their respective cargoes.</P>
<P>As an Englishman, I cannot but enjoy
the reflection, that Great Britain will ever
maintain a decided superiority in the dura∣bility
and intrinsic value of her shipping.
Were a judgment, indeed, to be formed
from external appearances, a casual ob∣server
would not fail to decide, as to this
article, in favour of Maryland, and the
adjacent provinces; American oak, greatly
exceeding the British in size and foliage;
but when the growth is taken into
<PB N="104" REF="152"/>
consideration, a manifest advantage is evi∣dent
in favour of the oaks of Britain. On
this continent, this very useful and valua∣ble
timber attains its highest state of per∣fection
in about fifty or sixty years: the
natural consequence is, that being of a
light and porous quality, it will not endure
the depredations of time, in any degree
equal to that which advance by slow de∣grees
to maturity. I have heard it asserted,
by persons of undoubted knowledge and
experience, that an English ship, formed
of solid and well-seasoned materials, is
worth more after a service of twenty years,
than the generality of American vessels
that have sailed only seven.</P>
<P>This reason, I think, strongly operates
against those, who penetrating into futu∣rity,
predict that the colonists must in∣evitably,
before many years are passed, be∣come
<PB N="105" REF="153"/>
great and formidable as a maritime
power; since the necessity under which
they must labour, of frequently rebuilding,
in order to support a navy, cannot but be
attended with expences that will require
immense revenues; so as always to check
their progress towards that distinction to
which they may possibly aspire.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Nov. 2, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>IN this remote region, my dear friend,
the phantom pleasure is pursued with
as much avidity as on your side of the At∣lantic;
and certainly with as much grati∣fication,
except by the injudicious herd
who form ideas of happiness from compa∣rison
alone.</P>
<P>Our races, which are just concluded,
continued four days, and afforded excel∣lent
amusement to those who are attached
to the pleasures of the turf; and, surpris∣ing
as it may appear, I assure you there
are few meetings in England better at∣tended,
or where more capital horses are
exhibited.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="155"/>
In order to encourage the breed of this
noble animal, a jockey club has been in∣stituted,
consisting of many principal gen∣tlemen
in this and in the adjacent provinces,
many of whom have imported from Bri∣tain,
at a very great expence, horses of
high reputation.</P>
<P>In America, the mild beauties of the
autumnal months amply compensate for
the fervent heats of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummer, and the rigid
feverity of winter. Nothing could exceed
the charming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erenity of the weather dur∣ing
these races; in consequence of which
there was a prodigious concourse of spec∣tators,
and considerable sums were depend∣ing
on the contest of each day. On the
first, a purse of one hundred guineas was
run for, free only for the members of the
club; and on the three following days sub∣scription
purses of fifty pounds each. As∣semblies,
and theatrical representations,
<PB N="108" REF="156"/>
were the amusements of the evening, at
which the company exhibited a fashionable
and brilliant appearance.</P>
<P>Our new theatre, of which I gave you
an account in a former letter, was opened
to a numerous audience the week preced∣ing
the races. The structure is not inele∣gant,
but, in my opinion, on too narrow
a scale for its length; the boxes are com∣modious,
and neatly decorated; the pit and
gallery are calculated to hold a number of
people without incommoding each other;
the stage is well adapted for dramatic and
pantomimical exhibitions; and several of
the scenes reflect great credit on the ability
of the painter. I have before observed,
that the performers are considerably above
meciocrity; therefore little doubt can be
entertained of their preserving the public
favour, and reaping a plenteous harvest.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="157"/>
Thus far on the article of pleasure. I
shall conclude with an observation of a se∣rious
nature.</P>
<P>In the course of my excursions, I have
conversed with divers intelligent planters,
who emigrated to this country, on account
of various discouraging circumstances which
baffled their utmost industry at home. A
principal cause which has been assigned by
very many for becoming adventurers in this
part of the world, is the custom, which is
becoming too prevalent in England, of
farming extensive farms, for the accommo∣dation
of wealthy tenants, and for greater
facility in collecting the rents.</P>
<P>Whatever present advantages may arise
from this practice, be assured a perseve∣rance
therein will be attended with con∣sequences
very prejudicial, for by this
means a sensible depopulation will ensue;
<PB N="110" REF="158"/>
a considerable tract of country will be oc∣cupied
by few inhabitants, and a multitude
of valuable members of the community,
will be obliged to abandon their homes and
connexions, and to court fortune in a dis∣tant
region, where land may be procured
for a trifling consideration, and where the
greatest encouragement is held out to skill
and application.</P>
<P>Reason and experience incontestibly prove
that in the number of inhabitants consists
the power and prosperity of the state. Agri∣culture,
manufactures, and arts, are found∣ed
on population, and a government natu∣rally
becomes wealthy and formidable, by
the strenuous exertions of industrious com∣petition.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Dec. 24, 1771.</DATE></P>
<P>THE intense heat which prevails dur∣ing
the summer, and the extremity
of cold in winter, I well know has been
asserted to be highly prejudicial to the con∣stitution;
though for my own part I have
not been sensible of any material inconve∣nience
from the opposite quality of the
seasons, but have continued to enjoy un∣interrupted
health and spirits.</P>
<P>The variations of the weather are cer∣tainly
more sudden in this part of America,
than even in the changeable climate of Bri∣tain.
During one part of the day I have
frequently thought the lightest apparel
scarcely supportable; when in a moment a
north-west wind has created sensations of
a very different nature, and a substantial
<PB N="112" REF="160"/>
suit of broad cloth has scarcely been suffi∣cient
to repel the cold.</P>
<P>Whatever you have heard relative to the
rigid puritanical principles and economi∣cal
habits of our American brethren, is
by no means true when applied to the in∣habitants
of the southern provinces. Li∣berality
of sentiment, and genuine hospi∣tality,
are every where prevalent; and I am
persuaded they too frequently mistake pro∣fuseness
for generosity, and impair their
health and their fortunes, by splendor of
appearance and magnificence of entertain∣ments.</P>
<P>The quick importation of fashions from
the mother country is really astonishing.
I am almost inclined to believe, that a new
fashion is adopted earlier by the polished
and affluent American, than by many opu∣lent
persons in the great metropolis; nor
are opportunities wanting to display supe∣rior
elegance. We have varied amusements,
<PB N="113" REF="161"/>
and numerous parties, which afford to the
young, the gay, and the ambitious, an ex∣tensive
field to contend in the race of vain
and idle competition. In short, very little
difference is, in reality, observable in the
manners of the wealthy colonist and the
wealthy Briton. Good and bad habits pre∣vail
on both sides the Atlantic.</P>
<P>It is but justice to confess, that the Ame∣rican
ladies possess a natural ease and ele∣gance
in the whole of their deportment;
and that while they assiduously cultivate ex∣ternal
accomplishments, they are still anx∣iously
attentive to the more important em∣bellishments
of the mind. In conversation
they are generally animated, and entertain∣ing,
and deliver their sentiments with af∣fability
and propriety. In a word, there
are, throughout these colonies, very many
lovely women, who have never passed the
bounds of their respective provinces, and
yet, I am persuaded, might appear to great
<PB N="114" REF="162"/>
advantage in the most brilliant circles of
gaiety and fashion.</P>
<P>In this country the marriage ceremony
is universally performed in the dwelling
houses of the parties. The company, who
are invited, assemble early in the evening,
and after partaking of tea and other re∣freshments,
the indissoluble contract is com∣pleted.
The bride and bridegroom then
receive the accustomed congratulations:
cards and dancing immediately succeed: an
elegant supper, a cheerful glass, and the
convivial song close the entertainment.</P>
<P>There are few places where young peo∣ple
are more frequently gratified with op∣portunities
of associating together than in
this country. Besides our regular assem∣blies,
every mark of attention is paid to the
patron Saint of each parent dominion; and
St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and
St. David, are celebrated with every par∣tial
<PB N="115" REF="163"/>
mark of national attachment. General
invitations are given, and the appearance is
always numerous and splendid.</P>
<P>The Americans on this part of the con∣tinent,
have likewise a Saint, whose history,
like those of the above venerable charac∣ters,
is lost in fable and uncertainty. The
first of May is, however, set apart to the
memory of Saint Tamina, on which occa∣sion
the natives wear a piece of a buck's
tail in their hats, or in some conspicuous
situation. During the course of the even∣ing,
and generally in the midst of a dance,
the company are interrupted by the sudden
intrusion of a number of persons habited
like Indians, who rush violently into the
room, singing the war song, giving the
whoop, and dancing in the stile of those
people; after which ceremony a collection
is made, and they retire well satisfied with
their reception and entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="164"/>
In this province there are scarce any ves∣tiges
of the original inhabitants, but it
does not appear that their numbers have
been reduced by any inhuman or indirect
practices of the British settlers. In Dorset
County, on the eastern shore of Maryland,
there are indeed the remains of a nation,
once populous and powerful, who, to this
day, retain considerable tracts of valuable
land, for which they receive an annual con∣sideration,
but by no means equivalent to
the real value. When every other Indian
nation thought it necessary to retire be∣yond
the range of the European settle∣ments,
these people it seems determined
to continue on their native spot. But
being precluded from their former occu∣pations
and pursuits, they became totally
indolent and inactive; and a different habit
of living, a violent propensity to spirituous
liquors, and the havock occasioned by the
small-pox, and other disorders, to which
<PB N="117" REF="165"/>
they were unaccustomed, reduced their
numbers to such a degree, that at this time
not twenty of their descendants remain.</P>
<P>Since no charge of cruelty can justly be
adduced, it becomes a natural enquiry what
is become of those numerous tribes that
formerly occupied this fertile territory?</P>
<P>Maryland, comparatively, is a small pro∣vince,
bounded on the west by the inte∣rior
counties of Virginia and Pennsylvania:
the Indians, from their particular mode of
living, require an extensive circuit, de∣pending
principally on hunting for their
support; and wherever their game becomes
scarce, they instantly quit that country for
a more eligible situation. As this colony
became populous, by the arrival and natu∣ral
increase of the new adventurers, the
Aborigines were circumscribed in their an∣cient
limits, and were consequently in∣duced
to relinquish their possessions, for a
<PB N="118" REF="166"/>
supposed equivalent, and retire to a more
extensive field of action.</P>
<P>From what cause I cannot ascertain,
but the North American Indians have ne∣ver
yet been known to incorporate with
Europeans; nor has any progress yet been
made in civilizing their manners, or in re∣claiming
them from that ignorance in
which they are universally involved. Their
habits appear rooted beyond the possibility
of conviction to remove; the present mo∣ment
engrosses every thought, regardless of
the events of futurity.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Feb. 17, 1772.</DATE></P>
<P>IT is true, my friend, that America is
rapidly increasing in population and im∣portance:
but a continent so extensive
must be very thinly inhabited for many
generations. Agriculture must, therefore,
be the grand object of colonial attention,
to a very distant period. While the peo∣ple
can be more profitably employed, as
they now are, in clearing and cultivating
land, it will be their interest to import the
various manufactures of the mother country,
it being evident that every species of goods
may be obtained much cheaper, and of a
superior quality, through the medium of
commercial intercourse, than by any pa∣triotic
exertions amongst themselves.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of the Ameri∣can
provinces, there are immense tracts of
<PB N="120" REF="168"/>
unappropriated lands. In every govern∣ment,
offices are established under regal or
proprietary authority, for the purpose of
granting the same to adventurers on stipu∣lated
terms. As the method of proceeding
in this business is nearly similar in every part
of the continent, an account of the mode
adopted with us will give you a general
idea of this matter. Take, therefore,
the following detail, which I have tran∣scribed
from an official record, for your
information.</P>
<P>“All papers relating to the granting of
vacant land,” within this province, issue
out and are recorded in the land office;
and the mode pursued to effect the grant
of such vacant lands, is by warrants, either
special or common. If the lands are cul∣tivated
or improved, they cannot be effected
by any other than a special warrant, spe∣cifying
the particular location and quan∣tity
to be effected. And all such warrants
<PB N="121" REF="169"/>
issue in consequence of an order from the
proprietary's agent, intimating that the
caution money of five pounds sterling, <HI>per</HI>
hundred acres, is paid. The warrant is
directed to the surveyor of the county
where the land lies, who makes a survey,
and returns a certificate thereof into the
land office; from whence it is transmitted
to the examiner general, and after exami∣nation,
it is again sent back to the land-office:
a patent, or grant, then issues on
the certificate, subject to the payment of
an annual rent of four shillings sterling for
every hundred acres. The fees attending
granting the warrant; of the survey in
consequence; of the examination of the
certificate; issuing patent thereon; and
affixing the great seal of the province
thereto, will amount to about the sum of
seven or eight pounds currency, <HI>per</HI> hun∣dred
acres.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="170"/>
“The same mode is exactly pursued in
common warrants,” to effect uncultivated
lands, but the expences are rather less.</P>
<P>“It is to be observed, the aforesaid war∣rants
are to effect lands never before taken
up.” There are other warrants that issue
out of the land-office, such as warrants of
re-survey, escheat warrants, and warrants
under the proclamation.</P>
<P>“The first of these are granted to re-sur∣vey
a tract of land,” already patented, and
in which the petitioner has a fee-simple;
and to add all, or any contiguous vacancy,
whether cultivated or otherwise. This
warrant, as well as all others, must be ex∣ecuted,
or renewed within the first six
months from the time of granting, other∣wise
they are of no force or effect; and
any vacant land added, if not paid for
within two years from the date of the war∣rant,
(agreeable to sundry proclamations
published) will become subject and liable
<PB N="123" REF="171"/>
to the benefit of the first discoverer thereof.
And hence the proclamation warrants take
their rise, <HI>for they, and no other warrants,</HI>
can legally effect lands thus circumstanced.</P>
<P>“Warrants of Escheat,” are only grant∣ed
in instances where the original paten∣tees,
or persons claiming under them, have
died seised in fee, intestate, and without
heirs, of tracts of land heretofore granted,
with liberty given of effecting, as well such
original tracts of Escheat, as any vacant
land thereto adjoining. The composition
money payable, as in the above cases; with
this distinction, that the quality of the
escheat land, and improvements thereon,
are more particularly described by the sur∣veyor,
and from such description the agent,
or receiver-general, ascertains the real va∣lue
of the land so escheated. The peti∣tioner
is entitled to one third of the full
valuation of the escheat for the discovery;
and the residue, together with any vacancy
<PB N="124" REF="172"/>
added, must be paid for, to entitle him to
a grant. The fees and expences inciden∣tal
to all these warrants, are considerably
more than in primitive surveys, and cannot
be particularly ascertained till the whole
business is compleated.</P>
<P>“By an instruction from the Board of
revenue,” no certificate whatever can be
patented, though every requisite be com∣plied
with, till it has lain three months in
the office. The intention of this instruc∣tion
is to give persons who might be in∣jured
by the operation of secret surveys,
an opportunity of contesting such surveys
by a caveat.</P>
<P>“The land-office, and all offices re∣specting
the proprietary's revenue, are, in
a great measure, subject to the control of
the board of revenue, which was esta∣blished
by the late Lord Proprietary. Upon
a declaration of a caveat in the land office,
if it should be dissatisfactory to the parties,
<PB N="125" REF="173"/>
they may appeal to the board of revenue,
and have the matter reheard and deter∣mined
by them.”</P>
<P>The annual revenue of the proprietary,
arising from the sale of lands, and the
yearly quit rent, after deducting all the
various charges of government, averages at
twelve thousand five hundred pounds <HI>per
annum.</HI> All offices, excepting those in the
service of the customs, are in his gift, or
in the gift of his representative for the
time being. This patronage includes a
very extensive range of lucrative, and re∣spectful
stations; and consequently throws
great weight and influence into the scale of
government.</P>
<P>This influence is considered by many,
as inimical to the essential interests of the
people; a spirit of party is consequently
excited; and every idea of encroachment
is resisted, by the popular faction, with all
the warmth of patriotic enthusiasm.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="174"/>
I have before observed, that elections in
this province are triennial. The delegates
returned, are generally persons of the
greatest consequence in their different
counties; and many of them are perfectly
acquainted with the political and commer∣cial
interests of their constituents. I have
frequently heard subjects debated with great
powers of eloquence, and force of reason;
and the utmost regularity and propriety
distinguish the whole of their proceed∣ings.</P>
<P>During the sitting of the assembly, the
members of both houses receive a stated
sum for their attendance on public busi∣ness;
and the number of days being pro∣perly
certified, they are regularly paid their
respective claims at the conclusion of each
session<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Members of the upper house, nine shillings sterling <HI>per diem;</HI> those of the lower, about eight shillings and six-pence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="175"/>
Provincial and country magistrates are
appointed by the governor. The former
are commissioned to try capital offences,
and important causes relative to property;
the latter preside in the county courts.
They have likewise, individually, power
to determine causes of the value of forty
shillings; and to inflict punishment on
servants, complaint being regularly made,
and the matter proved by their employers.</P>
<P>The governor has a discretionary autho∣rity
to pardon persons capitally convicted;
and by the principles of the constitution,
he is obliged to sign all warrants for the
execution of those who suffer agreeable to
sentence.</P>
<P>A litigious spirit is very apparent in this
country. The assizes are held twice in
the year, in the city of Annapolis, and the
number of causes then brought forward, is
really incredible. Though few of the gen∣tlemen
who practice in the courts have
<PB N="128" REF="176"/>
been regularly called to the bar, there are
several who are confessedly eminent in their
profession; and those who are possessed of
superior abilities, have full employment
for the exertion of their talents, and are paid
in due proportion by their respective clients.</P>
<P>The natives of these provinces, even
those who move in the humbler circles of
life, discover a shrewdness and penetration,
not generally observable in the mother
country. On many occasions, they are
inquisitive, even beyond the bounds of
propriety; they discriminate characters
with the greatest accuracy; and there are
few who do not seem perfectly conversant
with the general, and particular interests
of the community. An idea of equality
also seems generally to prevail, and the
inferior order of people pay but little ex∣ternal
respect to those who occupy supe∣rior
stations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sep. 7th, 1772.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM just returned from an excursion
to the frontiers of this province, in
which my curiosity was highly gratified.
It is impossible to conceive a more rich
and fertile country than I have lately tra∣versed;
and when it becomes populous in
proportion to its extent, Frederick County
will, at least, be equal to the most desira∣ble
establishment on this side the Atlantic.</P>
<P>In the back settlements, where the in∣habitants
are but thinly scattered, the face
of the country, even at this luxuriant sea∣son
of the year, exhibited in many places
a dreary appearance. Lands, to a very
considerable extent, are taken up by per∣sons,
who looking to futurity for greater
advantages, are content to clear gradually
some portions of their domains for imme∣diate
<PB N="130" REF="178"/>
subsistence. Not having the means
to fell, and carry their timber away, they
make a deep incision with an axe entirely
round each trunk, at the distance of about
four feet from the ground, which occasions
the leaves almost instantly to wither; and
before the total decay of the tree, Indian
corn may be cultivated to great advan∣tage,
amidst the immense trunks that fill
the dreary forest.</P>
<P>To have the idea of winter impressed on
the mind, from external appearances, at a
time when nature is fainting beneath the
intense heat of an autumnal sun, is, I am
inclined to believe, peculiar to this coun∣try.
In some districts, far as the eye could
extend, the leafless trees of an astonishing
magnitude crowded on the sight; the creep∣ing
ivy only denoting vegetation; at the
same time, the face of the earth, was covered
with golden crops, which promised,
<Q>“Richly to repay the anxious toil.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="179"/>
The habitations of the planters, in this
remote district of the province, are, in ge∣neral,
of a rude construction; the timber
with which they frame their dwellings,
seldom undergoing the operation of any
tool except the axe. An apartment to
sleep in, and another for domestic purposes,
with a contiguous store-house, and conve∣niences
for their live-stock, at present gra∣tify
their utmost ambition. Their me∣thod
of living, perfectly corresponds with
their exterior appearance. Indian corn,
beaten in a mortar, and afterwards baked
or boiled, forms a dish which is the prin∣cipal
subsistence of the indigent planter,
and is even much liked by many per∣sons
of a superior class. This, when pro∣perly
prepared, is called <HI>homony,</HI> and when
salt beef, pork, or bacon, is added, no
complaints are made respecting their fare.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of this province,
fruit is not only plentiful, but excellent in
<PB N="132" REF="180"/>
various kinds. There are very few planta∣tions
unprovided with an apple, and a peach
orchard; the peach trees are all standards,
and without the assistance of art, frequently
produce fruit of an exquisite flavour.</P>
<P>In the woods, I have often met with
vines, twining round trees of different de∣nominations;
and have gathered from them
bunches of grapes of a tolerable size, and
not unpleasant to the palate. In process
of time, when the colonists are enabled to
pay attention to their natural advantages,
they will, assuredly, possess all the super∣fluities,
as well as the conveniences of life,
without the necessity of recurring to fo∣reign
assistance. Even sugar, of a tolera∣ble
quality, they will be able to manufac∣ture
without application to the British
Islands. A planter, at whose house
I partook of some refreshment, pro∣duced
a quantity of that capital luxury,
the grain of which was tolerable, and the
<PB N="133" REF="181"/>
taste not disagreeable. This, he assured
me, was the produce of his own posses∣sions,
extracted by incision, from a tree,
great numbers of which grow throughout
the interior regions of the American pro∣vinces
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Maple-tree.</NOTE>. The simple process of boiling,
brought the luscious liquid to a proper
consistency; and he was persuaded, when∣ever
more important concerns would per∣mit
a necessary attention to this article, the
inhabitants of the British colonies would be
amply supplied from their own inexhausti∣ble
resources.</P>
<P>About thirty miles west of Frederick-town,
I passed through a settlement which
is making quick advances to perfection.
A German adventurer, whose name is Ha∣gar,
purchased a considerable tract of land
in this neighbourhood, and with much
discernment and foresight, determined to
<PB N="134" REF="182"/>
encouragement to traders, and to erect pro∣per
habitations for the stowage of goods,
for the supply of the adjacent country.
His plan succeeded: he has lived to be∣hold
a multitude of inhabitants on lands,
which he remembered unocupied; and
he has seen erected in places, appropriated
by him for that purpose, more than an
hundred comfortable edifices, to which the
name of Hagar's Town is given, in honour
of the intelligent founder.</P>

<P>BY an act of the assembly of this pro∣vince,
a residence of three years is
requisite as a qualification for holding
any office immediately dependent on the
proprietary. This regulation affords secu∣rity
<PB N="135" REF="183"/>
against the intrusion of strangers, who
might arrive from the mother country,
under a patronage too strong for any local
interest.</P>
<P>Having happily completed the limited
term, I have begun to experience the boun∣ty
of my patron, and find myself already
in possession of an office of trust and re∣spectability;
and not unauthorized to look
forward to a still better provision. I hope
it is unnecessary to say, that I am content
and grateful under such circumstances, and
yet there is something which seems to ob∣scure
my prospect, and to lessen that hap∣piness
which would otherwise be complete.</P>
<P>It is I know both imprudent and cul∣pable,
“to shape the fashion of uncertain
evils;” yet it is almost impossible to
avoid drawing unfavourable conclusions
from that spirit of party which, at this

British Colonies.</P>

jealousy and discontent; and unless

dissention which is become but too evident,
and involve this now happy country in
complicated misery.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Feb. 20, 1773.</DATE></P>
<P>YOUR observations on the resources
of America are well founded. I
grant they are infinite, and I am persuaded
that, in process of time, she will be ena∣bled
to avail herself of innumerable ad∣vantages;
but those that assert she will ef∣fectually
rival Great Britain in that inva∣luable
staple of her commerce, the <HI>woollen
manufactory,</HI> are, indeed, by far too san∣guine
in their expectations: coarse cloths
for the wear of servants and negroes, the
<PB N="140" REF="188"/>
colonists may probably be enabled to ma∣nufacture,
but insurmountable objections
arise to the production of those of a supe∣rior
quality.</P>
<P>To judge of this climate, by the paral∣lel
degrees of latitude in Europe, it is na∣tural
to conclude, that the middle pro∣vinces
experience very little of the rigour
of winter, and that, in fact, their greatest
inconvenience must arise from intense heat,
during the summer months. But, extra∣ordinary
as it may appear, this country,
from local circumstances, is accustomed to
every severity of the opposite seasons. I
assure you, that I have been less sensible
of the influence of the sun in the hottest
seasons in the island of Jamaica, than in
this part of British America; and I am cre∣dibly
informed, that no material difference
prevails from New York inclusive, to the
southern extremity of Virginia. To the
northward of New York the winters con∣tinue
<PB N="141" REF="189"/>
longer; the cold is equally intense;
and the summer, for its short duration, hot
in proportion. South of Virginia the cli∣mate
gradually becomes similar to the tor∣rid
zone, consequently the wool degene∣rates,
in a regular proportion, until the
external covering of the sheep becomes at
last a strong coarse hair resembling that of
goats.</P>
<P>In Maryland, and in the adjacent pro∣vinces,
the cold is more severe from Ja∣nuary
till the beginning of May, than in
any part of the island of Great Britain; in
consequence of which the American farmer
is reduced to the necessity of housing his
sheep during that rigid season. Summer
may, literally, be said to be seated on the
lap of winter, and the immediate transi∣tion
from cold to heat is, evidently, ex∣tremely
prejudicial to the growth and
improvement of wool; so that in quality
it is greatly inferior; nor is the quantity
<PB N="142" REF="190"/>
produced proportionable to what is yield∣ed
in the milder regions of the parent
state.</P>
<P>Under these disadvantages it may rea∣sonably
be concluded, that the American
settlements will ever be necessitated to look
up to Britain for a very considerable sup∣ply
of her invaluable staple. And even if
these causes did not operate, many years
must unavoidably elapse before the colo∣nists
can establish or conduct manufactures
in such a manner, as to enable them to
supply, even their own wants, on terms
of greater advantage than by relying on
external assistance.</P>
<P>This immense continent will require a
considerable population before the inhabi∣tants
can, with any propriety, divert their
attention from agriculture. To settle, and
to cultivate lands must be their first great
object; and the produce of those exertions
they must barter in exchange for European
<PB N="143" REF="191"/>
manufactures. In vain is encouragement
held forth, to induce ingenious artizans to
emigrate from their original situations. On
their arrival, either the allurements which
tempted them deceive their expectations;
or the natural wish to obtain a perma∣nent
establishment, supercedes every other
consideration, and induces a great majority
of these adventurers to purchase lands
which, comparatively, bear no price, and
the purchasers are reduced to rely on time
and industry to recompence their assiduity.</P>
<P>Another circumstance, very important
in its nature, likewise demands attention.
The price of labour must be greatly les∣sened
before the Americans can possibly
manufacture to any advantage; and this
inconvenience cannot be remedied, until,
by an overplus of people, there are com∣petitors
in every art, and a sufficient num∣ber
of opulent inhabitants to encourage and
reward their ingenuity.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="192"/>
At present, it is evident, that almost
every article of use or ornament, is to be
obtained on much more reasonable terms
from the mother country, than from arti∣zans
settled on this side the Atlantic. It
is also as certain, that goods of every kind
produced, or manufactured in England, are
greatly superior to the produce or manufac∣tures
of this continent. In process of time,
but a time far distant, the colonies may,
undoubtedly, from their great resources,
be enabled to rival Britain in many valuable
articles of commerce. But in your grand
staple, the growth and manufacture of
wool, you will, in a general point of view,
stand <HI>single</HI> and <HI>pre-eminent.</HI> Nature, in this
particular, has been exuberantly bountiful.
Your fertile downs are a source of inex∣haustible
wealth. Support that superiority,
which the benevolence of heaven has blest
you with, by a judicious and industrious
exertion of local advantages, and the power

the utmost efforts of opposition, and re∣main

<P>About the close of the year 1769, an

on with great dispatch, and, when com∣pleted,
will, at least, be equal to any pub∣lic
edifice on the American continent. The
legislature of this province, animated by
sentiments which reflect the highest credit
on their patriotism and wisdom, have also
determined, by a recent law, to endow and
found a college for the education of youth
in every liberal and useful branch of sci∣ence.
An institution of this nature was
most strongly recommended to their consi∣deration
by our worthy governor, at an
early period after his arrival in this coun∣try;
and to his laudable and persevering

noble mansion was projected for the resi∣dence
of the governor of Maryland. A
delightful situation was appropriated for
this purpose on the banks of the Severn,
within the limits of the city of Annapolis,
commanding, in every point of view, the
most interesting and beautiful objects. Ma∣terials
of every kind were provided equal
to the spirit of public liberality, and the
building was nearly completed in a stile
of superior magnificence, when an un∣happy
contention took place between the
governor and the delegates of the people,
which increased to such a degree, that,
at a period, when a very trifling sum
would have rendered it a noble habi∣tation,
the further prosecution of the
design was discontinued, and it has re∣mained
to this day, a melancholy and
<PB N="148" REF="196"/>
mouldering monument of the consequences
resulting from political dissentions.</P>
<P>The depredations of time have very
greatly injured the interior parts of this
edifice, which, in an unfinished state, has
continued many years, exposed to every
inclemency of weather. However, on a
late accurate survey, the outside structure,
and the principal timbers, are found in a
condition so perfect, that it is determined
to repair the damages sustained, and to ap∣ply
the building to the purposes of col∣legiate
education, for which every cir∣cumstance
contributes to render it truly
eligible. The adjacent country is open and
healthy; the contiguous grounds are suffi∣ciently
extensive for the advantages of exer∣cise
and amusement; and the fabric will
contain a variety of spacious and commo∣dious
apartments for the accommodation of
the professors and students.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="197"/>
Institutions of this nature are inseparably
connected with the interest and happiness
of these provinces; but with respect to
the parent state, they may possibly be at∣tended
with serious consequences. When
the real, or supposed necessity ceases of send∣ing
the youth of this continent to distant
seminaries for the completion of their edu∣cation,
the attachment of the colonies to
Great Britain will gradually weaken, and a
less frequent intercourse will tend to encou∣rage
those sentiments of self-importance
which have already taken too deep root, and
which, I fear, the utmost exertions of po∣litical
wisdom will never be able wholly to
eradicate. As an Englishman I therefore
cannot but view, with a partial regret,
every adopted plan that may possibly, in
the event, lessen or alienate the affec∣tion
of the colonists. And though I am
sensible the good of the whole ought to
supercede every private consideration, yet
<PB N="150" REF="198"/>
I cannot anticipate the future importance
and prosperity of America, without a most
fervent prayer, that every advantage she
may derive from her exertions, may
ultimately depend on a permanent and
constitutional connexion with the mother
country.</P>
<P>To the number of public erections, a
new church is likewise to be added; the
design of which does great credit to the
genius of the architect. It will be large,
neat, and commodious; and is to be built
on the scite of the ancient edifice, from
which many materials will be furnish∣ed.
This work is to be executed as
soon as possible; and we may reasonably
expect, if these different undertakings are
conducted with judgment, and spirit, that
they will be considered as valuable monu∣ments
of that refined taste, which so re∣markably
characterises the present times.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Nov. 8th, 1773.</DATE></P>
<P>“AS water to a thirsty soul, so is
news from a far country.” Your
circumstantial letter of the fourteenth of
September, afforded me the greatest satis∣faction:
I was at once entertained and in∣structed,
by your very judicious and pointed
observations on the present political system.
The repeal of the stamp-act, was a wise
and necessary measure: but on what prin∣ciple
subsequent laws have been enacted,
which have evidently the like tendency,
I am at a loss to determine. Were the
duties to be regularly collected, in conse∣quence
of the acts now in force, the reve∣nue
arising from them, would really be
inconsiderable. Nor do the colonists ground
their objections on the sums which, by this
<PB N="152" REF="200"/>
means, would be levied on the importation
of the enumerated articles; but they assert,
that the principle on which they resist the
operation of these laws, is briefly this:
“That they are wholly unconstitutional:
and that to admit their legality in a single
instance, would undoubtedly be to admit
a right, which might be considered by the
legislature of Great Britain, as a sufficient
authority to tax them at some future pe∣riod,
in any proportion adequate to the
real, or supposed exigencies of the state.”
How far they are to be justified in this opi∣nion,
I am not competent to determine;
but it is evident, that on this side the At∣lantic,
a spirit of discontent universally
prevails; and there are many desponding
individuals here, and in other provinces,
who already pretend to penetrate so deep
into the events of futurity, as to foretel
the most serious consequences.</P>
<P><Q>“From trivial cause, what mighty evils spring!”</Q>
<PB N="153" REF="201"/>
For my part, I will not indulge apprehen∣sions
of so melancholy a nature.</P>
<P>I have lately received a very sensible,
and very entertaining letter, from my valued
correspondent, Miss M—M—, who
informs me that her sister H—has, at
length, complied with the requisition of
many judicious and impartial friends, and
has ventured into public notice, in defiance
of criticism. On the 10th of May last, her
pastoral poem, “THE SEARCH AFTER
HAPPINESS,” made its first appearance; and
so rapid has been its success, that a second
large impression took place early in Au∣gust.
Lord Lyttelton, whose refined taste,
and accurate discernment, is universally ac∣knowledge,
has honoured the amiable au∣thor
with a letter, expressive of his warmest
approbation; and the public prints are
unanimous in bearing testimony to her me∣rit.
The copy I have received, is in con∣tinual
circulation, and indeed, it must argue
<PB N="154" REF="202"/>
a vitiated and depraved judgment in the
reader, not to be charmed with a produc∣tion
formed on a plan subservient to the
great interests of religion and virtue, and
decorated with all the graces and embel∣lishments
of poetry.</P>
<P>After paying this just tribute to the
talents of a lady who, I trust, will soon
attain a distinguished rank in the lite∣rary
world, I shall venture to conclude
this letter by the insertion of an epilogue,
which I wrote a few months since, at the
request of a friend, for the benefit of a
comedian at the theatre in Philadelphia.
As I am informed it was received with
approbation by a numerous audience, I
shall venture, with the greater confidence,
to add this little poetical effusion to your
manuscript collection.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 3d, 1774.</DATE></P>
<P>THE American prints will inform
you, ere you receive this, of the
recent proceedings at Boston. The whole
quantity of tea, contained on board three
vessels, amounting to three hundred and
forty-two chests, was on the 16th of De∣cember,
immersed in the bay. The East
India Company are the only sufferers on
this occasion; as all accounts perfectly
correspond in asserting, that this hasty bu∣siness
was transacted without the least de∣triment
<PB N="157" REF="205"/>
to private property. New York,
Philadelphia, Charles Town, and other places
it is universally imagined, will pursue similar
measures. Vast as this continent is, the
inhabitants appear animated, to a degree of
frenzy, with the same spirit of opposition.
Where the consequences will terminate,
Heaven knows! If a judgment may be
formed from the present disposition of the
people, I will venture to assert, that not the
least future taxation will ever be admitted
here, without what they conceive, a legal
representation.</P>
<P>As an Englishman, warmly attached to
my native country, and anxious for its ho∣nour
and prosperity; I view the impend∣ing
storm with inexpressible inquietude. I
fear my friend, our statesmen have promoted
measures which they will be equally embar∣rassed
to enforce, or defend. But these are
matters too high for my discussion; I detest
politics, and shall, therefore, leave you to
<PB N="158" REF="206"/>
make your own comments. I and mine
are well; would I could say we were per∣fectly
happy! Have I not reason to appre∣hend
my establishment is not so perma∣nent
as my flattering ideas had suggested?
Should the storm burst, it must inevitably
involve, in the same ruin, multitudes who
think differently, and are equally actuated
by conscientious principles.</P>

<P>ALL America is in a flame!—I
hear strange language every day.
The colonists are ripe for any measures
that will tend to the preservation of what
they call, their natural liberty. I enclose
you the resolves of <HI>our</HI> citizens; <HI>they</HI> have
<PB N="159" REF="207"/>
caught the general contagion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At a meeting of the inhabitants of the city of An∣napolis, on Wednesday, the twenty-fifth day of May, 1774, after notice given of the time, place, and occasion of this meeting;</P>
<P>Resolved, “that it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting,” that the town of Boston is now suffering in the common cause of America, and that it is incumbent on every colony in America, to unite in effectual measures to obtain a repeal of the late act of Parliament for block∣ing up the harbour of Boston.</P>
<P>“That it is the opinion of this meeting, that if the colonies come into a joint resolution to stop all importa∣tion from, and exportations to Great Britain, till the said act be repealed, the same will preserve North America, and her liberties.”</P>
<P>Resolved therefore, “That the inhabitants of this city will join in an association with the several counties of this province,” and the principal provinces of Ame∣rica, to put an immediate stop to all exports to Great Britain, and that after a short day, hereafter to be agreed on, that there shall be no imports from Great Britain, till the said act be repealed, and that such asso∣ciation be on oath.</P>
<P>“That it is the opinion of this meeting,” that the gen∣tlemen of the law of this province bring no suit for the recovery of any debt, due from any inhabitant of this pro∣vince to any inhabitant of Great Britain, until the said act be repealed.</P>
<P>“That the inhabitants of this city will,” and it is the opinion of this meeting, that this province ought imme∣diately to break off all trade and dealings with that co∣lony or province, which shall refuse or decline to come into similar resolutions with a majority of the colonies.</P>
<P>“That Messieurs John Hall, Charles Carroll,” Tho∣mas Johnson, jun. William Paca, Matthias Hammond, and Samuel Chase, be a committee for this city, to join with those who shall be appointed for Baltimore Town, and other parts of this province, to constitute one general committee; and that the gentlemen appointed for this city immediately correspond with Baltimore town, and other parts of this province, to effect such asso∣ciation as will secure American liberty.</P></NOTE>. Expresses
are flying from province to province. It
is the universal opinion <HI>here,</HI> that the mo∣ther
country cannot support a contention
with these settlements, if they abide steady
to the letter and spirit of their associations.
<PB N="160" REF="208"/>
Where will these matters end? Imagination
anticipates, with horror, the most dread∣ful
consequences. If the measures adopted
at home are founded on the principles of
justice, it will become administration to
be firm and decisive. If they are not, it
<PB N="161" REF="209"/>
will be adviseable, even on the score of
interest, not to abandon the substance for
a shadow. True policy will suggest the
expediency of embracing a conciliatory
system.</P>

<P>The Governor left Annapolis on the
twenty-eighth of last month, in order to
embark for England; where his private
concerns require, for a time, his presence.
He is now with his friend, Colonel F—,
at the mouth of the Potaxent. His dis∣patches
are to leave town this evening, as
the ship will certainly sail in the course of
the week.</P>
<P>You will observe, that the inclosed re∣solutions
of the citizens of Annapolis took
place in consequence of the act of Parlia∣ment
for blocking up the harbour of
Boston.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="210"/>
The meeting at which these resolutions
were passed, was on Wednesday the twenty-fifth
of May. But as it was evident that
the majority by which they were carried,
did not consist of the most respectable in∣habitants,
a protest made its appearance
on the ensuing Monday, signed by one hun∣dred
and thirty-five persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>TO THE PRINTERS.
<DATE>May 30th, 1774.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>A publication of the enclosed protest, supported by the names of a considerable number of the inhabitants of the city of Annapolis, will, it is presumed, furnish the most authentic grounds for determining the sense of the majo∣rity, on a question of the last importance.</P>
<P>We whose names are subscribed, inhabitants of the city of Annapolis, conceive it our clear right, and most incumbent duty, to express our cordial and explicit disap∣probation of a resolution which was carried by forty-seven against thirty-one, at the meeting held on the 27th instant.</P>
<P>The resolution against which we protest, in the face of the world, is the following.</P>
<P>“That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the gen∣tlemen of the law of this province, bring no suit for the recovery of any debt, due from any inhabitant of this province, to any inhabitant of Great Britain, until the said act be repealed.”—<HI>Dissentient.</HI></P>
<P>First, Because we are impressed with a full convic∣tion, that this resolution is founded in treachery and rash∣ness, in as much as it is big with bankruptcy and ruin to those inhabitants of Great Britain, who, relying with unlimited security on our good faith and integrity, have made us masters of their fortunes; condemning them <HI>unheard,</HI> for not having interposed their influence with parliament in favour of the town of Boston, without duly weighing the force, with which that influence would probably have operated; or whether, in their conduct, they were actuated by wisdom and policy, or by <HI>corrup∣tion</HI> and <HI>avarice.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Because whilst the inhabitants of Great Britain are partially despoiled of every legal remedy to recover what is justly due to them, no provision is made to prevent us from being harrassed by the prosecution of internal suits, but our fortunes and persons are left at the mercy of domestic creditors, without a possibility of ex∣tricating ourselves, unless by a general convulsion; an event, in the contemplation of sober reason, replete with horror.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because our credit, as a commercial people, will expire under the wound; for what confidence can possibly be reposed in those, who shall have exhibited the most avowed, and most striking proof that they are not bound by obligations as sacred as human invention can suggest.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>, amongst
<PB N="163" REF="211"/>
whom are to be found many of the first
importance in this city, and in the neigh∣bourhood.
You will, I doubt not, be
pleased to see that I have taken this oppor∣tunity
of avowing my sentiments on a sub∣ject,
which equally affects private reputa∣tion
and public faith.</P>
<P>I need not mention, that it is <HI>a particular
resolution</HI> against which the protest is le∣velled;
the others being of too popular
<PB N="164" REF="212"/>
a nature to admit of opposition. And,
indeed, the generality of those who have
ventured to assert the claims of honour,
to discharge their pecuniary obligations
to the mother country, are considered, by
the more violent party, as actuated by
sentiments inimical to the interests of
America: and it is even said, that they
would combat every attempt to obtain
a repeal of the obnoxious acts, if they
were not apprehensive of incurring the just
<PB N="165" REF="213"/>
resentment of an injured people. For my
own part, I verily believe that the majority
of the subscribers are influenced by motives
which reflect the highest credit on their
integrity, independent of political conside∣rations.</P>
<P>It is here necessary that I clear up a seem∣ing
contradiction. The resolutions inserted
in the Gazette are dated the twenty-fifth:
the protest alludes to transactions on the
twenty-seventh. After the publication of
the resolves entered into, in consequence
of the meeting held on the first-mentioned
day, several gentlemen of influence and
respectability had the courage to declare,
in the most express terms, that if the sen∣timents
of the people were properly col∣lected,
it would not appear that the WHOLE
of the proceedings received their unani∣mous
approbation. To obviate this ob∣jection,
hand-bills were distributed, and
a general attendance was earnestly re∣quested;
<PB N="166" REF="214"/>
in consequence of which, on the
evening of the twenty-seventh, a second
assembly of the citizens took place. But
instead of associating with that ardor the
zealous partizans expected, ONLY seventy-eight
persons were mustered on the im∣portant
occasion. Had the whole number
of those whose principles were directed
by moderation, thought it safe, or prudent
to appear in support of their sentiments,
the iniquitous resolution, against which we
have protested, would not have publicly
appeared, to the discredit of our province;
even admitting the conduct of Govern∣ment
with respect to this continent, to
be founded on maxims subversive of the
constitution. Surely, in a moral point of
view, it is highly criminal to attempt, by
unjust or indirect methods, to obtain a re∣dress
of the most oppressive grievances.</P>
<P>In these tempestuous times, your dear
sister supports her spirits wonderfully; yet
<PB N="167" REF="215"/>
are there moments, when she yields to bod∣ing
apprehensions, and anticipates the re∣newal
of sorrows and disappointments. She
has, however, this consolation to support
her, that whatever sufferings may be our
portion, we shall share them with each
other.</P>
<P>It is my solemn determination, without
regard to motives of interest or safety, to act
strictly upon principle. And though <HI>my</HI>
conduct will be of very little importance,
considered in a <HI>public</HI> point of view, yet
under all the varied circumstances of pros∣perity
or distress, the reflection of having
acted agreeably to the dictates of conscience,
will enhance the advantages of affluence,
or animate the mind to sustain, with be∣coming
fortitude, the most painful, and
unmerited reverse of fortune.</P>
<P>That the general tranquility may be
speedily re-established, is the fervent prayer
of your faithful, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE general attention is fixed on the
Congress now sitting in Philadel∣phia,
and all descriptions of people are
waiting for the result of their deliberations,
with the utmost impatience.</P>
<P>The Canada Bill is as unpopular here as
the Boston Port-bill, and adds greatly to
the universal discontent. The provinces are
unanimous in the cause of their northern
brethren, and contribute largely in sup∣plying
their necessities. The spirit of op∣position
to ministerial measures, appears to
blaze steadily and equally in every part of
British America, and unless some speedy
alteration takes place in the political sys∣tem,
the consequences must inevitably be
dreadful.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="217"/>
Every well-wisher to the interest and
happiness of the mother country, and her
colonies, must behold this unnatural con∣test
with inexpressible anxiety. There
never was a period in our history, more
critical that the present. It is high time
some methods were adopted to conciliate
these growing differences. The colonies
are daily gaining incredible strength. They
<HI>know,</HI> they <HI>feel,</HI> their importance; and
<HI>persuasion,</HI> not <HI>force,</HI> must retain them in
obedience.</P>
<P>A general non-importation agreement
will, speedily, take place; and I have rea∣son
to believe, will be resolutely adhered to.
It is therefore to be feared, the manufac∣turers
and artificers in Britain will be much
distressed, and probably driven to great ex∣tremities.
For I need not observe to a
man so conversant as you are with the
commercial interests of the empire, how
<PB N="170" REF="218"/>
severely the mother country must suffer
by an interruption of her extensive trade
with this continent. It is the universal
doctrine <HI>here,</HI> that it will plunge you into
violent commotions, and probably be at∣tended
with fatal consequences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The separation of America from Great Britain was contemplated, by persons of all descriptions, as pregnant with ruin to both countries. It must be granted, that in consequence of this event very many deserving individuals have experienced a reverse of fortune which has subjected them to innumerable difficulties and dis∣tresses: but in a political point of view, this dreaded revolution has been attended with circumstances highly beneficial to the parent state. The superiority of the manufactures of Britain, and the established knowledge of her merchants in all the articles essential for the Ame∣rican market, have given them decided advantages over every rival nation. Similarity of language, customs, and opinions, likewise powerfully operate in favours of the mother country; so that, at this period, with every pleasing prospect of an uninterrupted continuation, Bri∣tain supports a more extensive and a more lucrative commerce with the United States, than at any time during their immediate connexion as a part of her Em∣pire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A serious transaction took place, a few
days since, in this city. The affair is par∣tially
<PB N="171" REF="219"/>
represented in the Maryland Gazette.
I attended the whole progress of the bu∣siness,
and was active in my exertions to
prevent the extremities to which some
frantic zealots proceeded.</P>
<P>On Saturday the fifteenth instant, the
brig Peggy, Stewart, arrived from London
with servants, and an inconsiderable quan∣tity
of goods, among which were seven∣teen
packages, containing two thousand,
three hundred, and twenty pounds of tea,
consigned to Thomas Charles Williams and
company, merchants, in Annapolis. This
intended importation was immediately dis∣covered,
and the citizens were summoned
to a general meeting. On examination it
appeared, that Messrs. Williams had, on
this occasion, imported a larger quantity
of that detestable plant, as it is here term∣ed,
than by any former opportunity; and
that Mr. Anthony Stewart, the proprietor
<PB N="172" REF="220"/>
of the vessel, had paid the duties thereon;
though he was not, in any shape, concern∣ed
in the property. This was deemed a
submission to the contested claim of the
British Parliament. Very severe censures
were accordingly passed on the parties con∣cerned,
and a general spirit of resentment
appeared to predominate. After various
modes of proceeding had been proposed,
and discussed, it was determined to appoint
a committee to attend the vessel, and pre∣vent
the landing of the tea, until the sense
of the county could be fully collected.
The ensuing Wednesday was appointed for
that purpose, and proper measures were
pursued to give the necessary information.</P>
<P>Mr. Stewart, apprehensive of the con∣sequences
likely to ensue, with great pro∣priety
solicited a previous meeting of the
citizens on the following Monday; trust∣ing
that, by a timely submission, measures
<PB N="173" REF="221"/>
might be taken to prevent the assembling
of so numerous a body as were expected to
come in from the country; from whom
he had much to fear with respect to his
person and his property.</P>
<P>At this meeting it was proposed, by the
moderate party, that Messrs. Stewart and
Williams, who were desirous to make
atonement for the offence they had com∣mitted,
might be permitted to land and
burn the tea, in any place that should be
appointed for that purpose. This motion
was, however, strongly opposed by others,
who insisted on matters remaining as they
were, until the time appointed for the
county meeting, in order that a more pub∣lic
acknowledgment and satisfaction might
be made.</P>
<P>Mr. Stewart, with a view to moderate
the resentment which his conduct had un∣happily
occasioned, distributed the follow∣ing
<PB N="174" REF="222"/>
hand-bill and affidavit, which were
also publicly read; but without any appa∣rent
effect in his favour.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“To the Gentlemen of the Committee,”
the Citizens of Annapolis, and the In∣habitants
of Ann Arundel County.
“Gentlemen,”</OPENER>
<P>“I find by a hand-bill,” that you are
requested to meet to take into consideration
what is proper to be done with the tea,
the property of Thomas C. Williams and
Co. now on board the brig Peggy, Stewart,
and finding my conduct censured for hav∣ing
paid the duty on that tea to the col∣lector,
I take the liberty to present a plain
narrative of the part I have acted therein,
and the motives by which I was actuated.
Deeply interested as I am in the peace and
harmony of this country, no man would
be farther than myself from taking any
<PB N="175" REF="223"/>
steps to disturb them. I am not in the
least connected with any thing that relates
merely to the importation; indeed so cau∣tious
have I been of infringing in the least,
any of the resolutions of America, that I
did not order a single farthing's worth of
goods by that vessel, though I could have
done it on such easy terms as to freight,
and shipping charges; much less should
I have thought of ordering any tea, after
the disturbance which the importation of
that article had occasioned on the conti∣nent.
When the brig arrived, the captain
informed me she was very leaky, and that
the sooner she was unloaded the better.
I told him to enter his vessel, but not the
tea, which I found, on enquiry of the
collector, could not be done. Under these
circumstances, the brig leaky, and fifty-three
souls on board, where they had been
near three months, I thought myself bound,
both in humanity and prudence, to enter
<PB N="176" REF="224"/>
the vessel, and leave the destination of the
tea to the committee. The impropriety of
securing the duty did not then occur to me,
neither did I know the tea would be suf∣fered
to be lodged as a security for the pay∣ment.
I had nothing in view but to save
the vessel from a seizure, and of having
an opportunity of releasing the passengers
from a long and disagreeable confinement.
The duty on tea has been paid hitherto,
both in Virginia and Maryland, by every
importer of goods: in this case I am not
the importer. If I have erred in my part
of the transaction, I declare, upon my
honour, it is without the least intention;
I have infringed no rules prescribed by the
general resolutions of this province. It
happened unluckily, that the tea was put
on board of Captain Jackson's brig, in the
manner as will be seen by the annexed af∣fidavit;
and it can be incontestibly proved,
the captain refused taking tea on board:</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="225"/>
Mr. Williams was in London when the
tea was shipped, and must have known
that many merchants had refused to ship
that article. I have only to add, that I
am sincerely sorry my conduct, on this
occasion, has been the cause of so much
uneasiness, and freely submit it to your
candid consideration.</P>

<P>Captain Richard Jackson, master of the
brig Peggy Stewart, deposeth and saith,
“That immediately after the landing of
his cargo in London, he applied for, and
obtained a <HI>general</HI> permit from the Cus∣tom-house,
to receive <HI>India and other
goods</HI> on board for exportation; and, (as
is always customary in such cases) gave
<PB N="178" REF="226"/>
security, and took an oath not to re∣land
the same in any part of Great Bri∣tain.
But having great reason to be∣lieve
any importation of tea would be
unfavourably received in America, he
was fully determined, and had resolved
not to receive any on board; and pub∣lickly
on the Change of London, in the
month of July, refused to receive tea,
which was offered to be shipped by Kel∣ly,
Lott, and Co. This deponent fur∣ther
saith, that by the method of ship∣ping
goods from London, <HI>tea</HI> may be
put on board any ship, without the
knowledge of the master. All goods
are examined at the Custom-house, and
sent, by the shipper, in lighters, on
board the ship, with only a common
bill expressing the parcels, and not the
quantities contained, or the qualities of
them; these are received by the mate
of the ship, who gives a receipt on the
<PB N="179" REF="227"/>
lighter-bill, which is again returned to
the shipper, and the master signs his bills
of lading <HI>at London,</HI> by the lighter-bill,
specifying the parcels, without know∣ing
the contents, and clears out the ship
at the Custom-house with merchandize,
without knowing or mentioning of what
nature. The cockets containing the
particulars of each parcel, are sent by
the officers of the customs at London,
to the Custom-house at Gravesend, and
there lodged to be called for by the cap∣tain
or master of the ship on his passage
to sea. In this manner the goods ship∣ped
in the Peggy Stewart, were received
on board: And this deponent further
saith, that he saw Thomas Charles Wil∣liams,
to whom the tea is consigned,
and Amos Hayton, who shipped the
same, frequently in London, neither of
whom ever mentioned to him their in∣tention
of shipping any: That he did
<PB N="180" REF="228"/>
not know of any tea being on board,
until after he had received his cockets
at Gravesend, and that he would not
have received the same had he known
thereof.”</P>

<P>Mr. S—, on account of what was
deemed a cheerful and ready compliance
with an unconstitutional act of the British
legislature, was particularly obnoxious: and
though he publicly read his recantation,
expressed in the most submissive and peni∣tential
terms, there were frantic zealots
among the multitude, who warmly pro∣posed
the American discipline of tarring and
feathering. Others, with a less vindictive
spirit, were clamorous for the destruction
of the brig, which had imported the hate∣ful
commodity: whilst many others, who
indeed were the more numerous party, can∣didly
declared, “that the paper signed by
the offenders, with their unextorted con∣sent
<PB N="183" REF="231"/>
to burn the tea, was a sufficient pu∣nishment,
and satisfaction.” But to de∣termine
this point with certainty, it was
proposed and assented to, that a division
should take place on the following question:
“Whether the vessel should, or should
not be destroyed?” when it was carried
in the negative by a considerable majority;
the citizens, in general, appearing averse to
violent measures. But as the minority were
chiefly persons who resided at a distance
from Annapolis; as some of them had
great influence in their neighbourhood;
and intimated a determined resolution to
proceed to the utmost extremities, the in∣stant
they could collect sufficient numbers
to support them, Mr. Stewart was induced,
from an anxious desire to preserve the pub∣lic
tranquillity, as well as to ensure his own
personal safety, to propose setting fire him∣self
to the vessel; which being immedi∣ately
assented to, he instantly repaired on
<PB N="184" REF="232"/>
board, accompanied by several gentlemen
who thought it necessary to attend him,
and having directed her to be run on
ground, near the wind-mill point, he made
a sacrifice of his valuable property to intem∣perate
zeal and clamour; and in a few hours
the brig, with her sails, cordage, and every
appurtenance, was effectually burnt.</P>
<P>By comparing the foregoing account with
the circumstances stated in the Maryland
Gazette, a manifest difference appears.
Every step that Messrs. Stewart and Wil∣liams
took in this transaction, to the pre∣judice
of their property, seems, in that
publication, to proceed from a voluntary
election, unawed and unintimidated by the
multitude: but I need not comment on
the absurdity of such an opinion. The
truth is, they destroyed property of great
value, to prevent worse consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="233"/>
Annapolis, <DATE>Nov. 2d.</DATE></P>
<P>The Congress have concluded their de∣liberations.
I have seen their resolves;
the association; the petition to his ma∣jesty;
and the addresses to Great Britain, to
Canada, and to the confederating Ameri∣can
colonies.</P>
<P>The petition to the king is not to be
published on this side the water, until
advice is received of its delivery at St.
James's. It was sent home from Phila∣delphia,
by a ship, which by this time, is,
probably, far on its way. God knows
what influence these papers may have in
England. If they are supported by truth,
may they produce effects to the mutual
advantage of all parties! The petition is
held to be a masterly performance; firm,
explicit, and respectful: the Address to
Great Britain is thought to be pathetic and
persuasive; that to Canada, to be founded
<PB N="186" REF="234"/>
on sentiments of liberty and reason; and
that to the uniting provinces, to be instruc∣tive
and moderating. I have perused them
with impartial attention, but am not com∣petent
to determine on their respective
merits. It is evident the colonists are
unanimous, and will steadily support the
proceedings of their delegates. Our
printer is closely engaged at the press: the
whole will make a tolerable pamphlet; and
should the publication take place before
this packet is dispatched, I shall forward it
by the same conveyance.</P>
<P>I do not imagine the present situation of
affairs will materially affect you; at least
for some time: but I and mine are al∣ready
too sensible of the evils attending
the contest. My income is now consi∣derably
reduced; trade is already at a
stand; and on the 1st of December, a ge∣neral
<PB N="187" REF="235"/>
non-importation takes place. Com∣modities
of every kind are, at this early
period, become scarce and dear. Neither
money, or bills can be found; and few peo∣ple
are sufficiently provided to answer the
purposes of their necessary expenditure.
Amidst every suffering, the reflection that
thousands of industrious manufacturers at
home, must take their proportion of the
impending calamity, gives infinite disqui∣etude
to every honest and feeling mind.</P>
<P>The West Indies, will likewise severely
suffer; for without any share in political
proceedings, they are doomed to a heavy
punishment.</P>

<P>The Governor is returned to a land of
trouble. He arrived about ten this morn∣ing
in perfect health. He is now com∣menced
an actor on a busy theatre; his part
<PB N="188" REF="236"/>
a truly critical one. To stem the popular
torrent, and to conduct his measures with
consistency, will require the exertion of
all his faculties. The present times de∣mand
superior talents; and his, I am per∣suaded,
will be invariably directed to pro∣mote
the general good. Hitherto his con∣duct
has secured to him a well-merited
popularity; and his return to the province
has been expected with an impatience
which sufficiently evinces the sentiments
of the public in his favour. May he be
enabled to discharge his duties to the parent
state, and to the country over which he
presides, with unblemished credit, and un∣interrupted
tranquillity! Enclosed, you have

<P>THERE is but too much reason to∣apprehend
that the hour is approach∣ing
when even the intercourse of letters
will be greatly interrupted, if not totally
prohibited.</P>
<P>From one extremity of this continent
to the other, every appearance indicates
approaching hostilities. The busy voice
of preparation echoes through every set∣tlement;
and those who are not zealously
infected with the general frenzy, are
considered as enemies to the cause of li∣berty;
and, without regard to any peculi∣arity
of situation, are branded with oppro∣brious
appellations, and pointed out as vic∣tims
to public resentment.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="238"/>
Very considerable subscriptions have been
made in every quarter, for the relief of the
Bostonians: large sums have likewise been
collected for the purchase of arms and am∣munition,
and persons of all denominations
are required to associate under military re∣gulations,
on pain of the severest censure;
every measure, while tending to the most
fatal consequences, is eagerly and wildly
pursued.</P>
<P>Admitting the evils complained of to be
founded on reality, the mode adopted to
obtain redress cannot, in my opinion, be
justified on principles of reason or sound
policy. I have, therefore, refused to join
in any of the proposed contributions;
to appears in any of their associations; or to
enrol in any military corps. I have even
attempted to moderate the enthusiasm of
intemperate zeal, by the following appeal
to Common Sense and Common Equity;
which, through the medium of the Mary∣land
<PB N="191" REF="239"/>
Gazette, has been submitted to pub∣lic
inspection; and if favourable conclu∣sions
may be drawn from appearances, it
has been received with considerable ap∣probation,
my letter having already been
reprinted in almost every paper throughout
this continent.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>“TO THE PRINTERS.”</HEAD>
<P>“The present unhappy contention be∣tween
the <HI>mother country</HI> and her <HI>colonies,</HI>”
is a matter of the deepest concern to every
honest, every feeling mind: it is, there∣fore,
the indispensable duty of every friend
to society, to study and to pursue those
methods, which may lead to a perfect re∣conciliation,
and the establishment of a
permanent union between <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>“The principle of <HI>parliamentary taxation</HI>
over this extensive part of the empire,” is
<PB N="192" REF="240"/>
generally denied by all ranks, and denomi∣nations
of men; the grand subject of con∣troversy,
therefore, that prevails at pre∣sent,
respects <HI>the most eligible method to
obtain redress.</HI> On this point, there ap∣pears
a division of sentiment, which has
given rise to <HI>heart-burnings and discontent;</HI>
and, in some degree, struck at the root of
that harmony which, at this important
period, ought to <HI>guide</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> every
action.</P>
<P>“In opposition to measures dictated by
<HI>calmness</HI> and <HI>moderation,</HI>” (a steady adherence
to which, it was generally supposed, would
be attended with the most happy effects)
<HI>a military appearance</HI> is assumed—<HI>subscrip∣tions</HI>
are industriously making for the pur∣chase
of <HI>arms, ammunition,</HI> &amp;c. and the
<HI>severest censure</HI> is indiscriminately passed on
those person who happen to dissent from
the popular opinion, and prefer more con∣ciliating
methods of accommodation.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="241"/>
“It is certain that there are many in <HI>this,</HI>”
and other <HI>provinces,</HI> who object to the
spirit of violence, which seems at this
time too predominant. Convinced of the
propriety of their sentiments, and the in∣tegrity
of their hearts, they conceive the
cause of America may be <HI>totally injured</HI> by
a precipitate, and unnecessary defiance of
the power of Great Britain: they firmly
believe, that a respectful behaviour to their
<HI>sovereign</HI> and their <HI>mother country</HI>—a du∣tiful
and constitutional application to the
<HI>throne</HI>—and a firm perseverance in <HI>virtuous,</HI>
though <HI>pacific principles,</HI> will, in the issue,
be productive of the most felicitous conse∣quences.
Actuated by such considerations,
they cannot be reconciled to those violent
extremes which have been too rashly
adopted by many; and which they are
anxious to establish, as the <HI>only</HI> feasible
plan of terminating the present dissensions.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="242"/>
“On deliberate reflection,” it can hardly
be imagined, that the mother country has
formed the least intention of reducing these
provinces to a state of abject servility, by
the force of arms; the <HI>natural connexion</HI>—
the <HI>close ties</HI>—and <HI>nice dependencies,</HI> which
exist between the different parts of the
empire, forbid indulging any conclusions
of so melancholy a nature. She will be
more just—more tender to her offspring—
the voice of reason will prevail—our griev∣ances
will be redressed—and she will be
found, <HI>to the end of time,</HI> a kind—a fos∣tering
parent!—But admitting that Great
Britain were determined to enforce a sub∣mission
to all her mandates; even in that
case, we have little cause to apprehend,
that she will <HI>unsheath the sword,</HI> and esta∣blish
her decrees in <HI>the blood of thousands.</HI>
A more safe and certain method is obvious:
a small proportion of <HI>her naval power</HI> would
entirely shut up our harbours—suspend our
<PB N="195" REF="243"/>
trade—impoverish the inhabitants—pro∣mote
intestine divisions—and involve us in
all the horrors of anarchy and confusion.
To avoid evils, <HI>even great as these,</HI> we are
not meanly to bend the neck, and submit
to every innovation. But when there is
no prospect of such dreadful calamities,
why are we to form ideas of <HI>battles</HI> and of
<HI>slaughter?</HI> Why are our coasts to resound
with <HI>hostile preparations?</HI>—the demon of
<HI>discord</HI> to stalk at large—and <HI>friends</HI> and
<HI>kindred</HI> forget the peaceful bonds of <HI>amity</HI>
and <HI>love?</HI></P>
<P>“It has been objected by the advocates
for moderation,” that the methods pursued
to complete the subscription for arms, &amp;c.
has more the complexion of <HI>an arbitrary
tax,</HI> than <HI>a voluntary contribution.</HI> On
the other hand, it has been asserted, “that
money raised in a manner,” where there
is no obligation to pay but a sense of duty;
<PB N="196" REF="244"/>
and no other mode to induce compliance,
but shame and infamy, cannot be deemed
<HI>a tax.</HI> A sense of duty is, undoubtedly,
the most noble incentive to <HI>worthy actions;</HI>
but a false dread of <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>infamy,</HI> has
perverted many <HI>an honest heart,</HI> and too fre∣quently
proved an irresistible temptation to
<HI>dishonourable practices.</HI> Let us a moment
reflect:—Can there be an imposition more
arbitrary and severe, than a necessity of
assenting to any particular measure, or for∣feiting
<HI>that fair</HI>—that <HI>unsullied reputation,</HI>
which alleviates the cares of life, and
smooths the inevitable rugged path to the
dreary mansions of the grave!</P>

On perusing the above humble effort of
my pen, it will readily occur to you, that
if I had, in the most distant manner, ad∣mitted
the right of parliamentary taxation,
my address, in times like these, could not
possibly have been productive of any salu∣tary
consequences. The denial of that
right being the prevailing creed of the co∣lonies,
I found myself necessitated to co∣incide
with the popular opinion, that I
might strike, with the greater efficacy, at
that vindictive, arbitrary system, which
under the fallacious pretence of support∣ing
the interests of constitutional freedom,
exerts a tyrannical authority, in order to
enforce hostile opposition in preference to
moderate and respectful applications.</P>
<P>How far the legislative authority of
Great Britain legally extends over the
American Provinces, is beyond the extent
of my limited abilities to determine. In
<PB N="200" REF="248"/>
the confidence of conversation, I daily
hear various opinions, supported by strength
of argument and accuracy of observation,
and from what I have heard, and am en∣abled
to judge, I am clearly convinced
that much more is apprehended than
has any existence in reality. But in all
countries there are busy, turbulent spirits,
who from motives of ambition, avarice,
or discontent, “infect the general ear with
horrid speech:” by eagerly pressing for∣wards,
as champions in the public cause,
they agitate the passions of the misguided
multitude, and imperceptibly lead them to
the most dreadful extremities.</P>
<P>It is with pleasure I am able to assert,
that a greater degree of moderation appears
to predominate in this province, than in
any other on the continent; and I am
perfectly assured we are very materially in∣debted
for this peculiar advantage to the
<PB N="201" REF="249"/>
collected and consistent conduct of our
Governor, whose views appear solely di∣rected
to advance the interests of the com∣munity;
and to preserve, by every possible
method, the public tranquillity. How
long we may continue thus distinguished,
time alone must determine. Should our
demagogues obtain the ascendency, after
which they labour, we shall assuredly equal
any of our neighbours in those violences
of which we now only contemplate the
commencement.</P>

<P>Annapolis, Wednesday Even. <DATE>April 26, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>ABOUT noon this day, arrived an
express from Boston, which brought
an account, “that on the 19th instant
a detachment of the king's troops, con∣sisting
of about a thousand men, being
ordered on some secret duty, at a place
called Lexington, fell in with a company
of provincials, whom they attacked with∣out
any provocation, killed six, and wound∣ed
four: that on an alarm being given,
the regulars were, in consequence, assault∣ed
by a numerous body of the militia, who
had surrounded them; and it was sup∣posed
the conflict would be desperate and
bloody.”</P>
<P>An additional paragraph says, “that
General Gage had sent a reinforcement,
<PB N="203" REF="251"/>
with some artillery, to sustain the troops;
but that measures were taken to prevent
their junction: that when the express was
dispatched, about one hundred and fifty
soldiers were killed, and about fifty New
Englandmen; and that the engagement
continued with determined resolution.”</P>
<P>With the most dreadful anxiety are we
now waiting for further, and more circum∣stantial
intelligence.</P>
<P>The last advices from London intimate,
that both Houses of Parliament have ad∣dressed
his Majesty, requesting him to en∣force
the acts; and that it has been de∣termined,
in consequence, to increase the
army already in America.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, this intelligence
has brought on the commencement of hos∣tilities;
the violent party having conceiv∣ed
the practica<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ility of reducing General
<PB N="204" REF="252"/>
Gage, before he is rendered more formid∣able
by the fresh supplies. Should the
event be answerable to their expectation,
the measure will be applauded by very many
of the rash and inconsiderate. If they fail,
the disappointment may, probably, give
encouragement to the cool and moderate
throughout the different provinces, to exert
their influence and their abilities, in order
to prevent the continent, in general, from
participating in the miseries of war!</P>
<P>The Provincial Convention are now sit∣ting
in Annapolis, but strangers are not
permitted to attend their debates. They
have already dispatched an express to the
southward, in consequence of the informa∣tion

These men have ever been
of opinion, that the plantations ought
to contribute more liberally than they at
present do, in return for the advantages of
commerce, and for the protection afforded
by Great Britain. But how far his lord∣ship's
conciliatory scheme may operate,

now when actual hostilities are commenced,
heaven alone can determine.</P>

<P>Last night advice was received from Vir∣ginia,
that the powder and stores in the
magazine at Williamsburg, were taken
from thence by some marines belonging
to one of his Majesty's vessels on that sta∣tion,
by order of his Excellency Lord
Dunmore.</P>
<P>This intelligence has given an additi∣onal
alarm to our patriotic party; and ac∣cordingly
some gentlemen were deputed
by the convention to wait on the gover∣nor;
soliciting him to give directions, that
the arms, powder, and stores, belonging
to the province, should be delivered into
their possession; apprehensions being en∣tertained,
“That some ship of war may
arrive in the harbour of Annapolis, whose
<PB N="207" REF="255"/>
commander might probably have instruc∣tions
to seize the same.”</P>
<P>The deputation was received with
respect, and the governor promised to
consult his council with all possible dis∣patch.
This answer has given satis∣faction
for the present; and the militia,
who were assembled to enforce submission,
are departed quietly to their habitations.</P>
<P><DATE>April 28.</DATE></P>
<P>To prevent riot and confusion, the go∣vernor
and council have thought it ad∣viseable
to comply with the requisition of
the convention, on condition that the co∣lonels
of the militia, in the respective coun∣ties
under the ancient establishment, so∣licit
for the delivery of the arms, powder
and stores, pointing out the necessity of
the measure. By this mode of proceed∣ing,
the dignity of government is main∣tained,
<PB N="208" REF="256"/>
and the public tranquillity preserv∣ed.
In these turbulent times, something
must be yielded to the clamour of an infa∣tuated
multitude.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of New York have hi∣therto
discovered sentiments favourable to
government: but if the sword is unsheath∣ed,
it is apprehended they will almost unani∣mously
fall into the ranks of opposition. A
report is circulated, that fourteen regiments
are ordered to that city, who are to pre∣vent
all communication between the south∣ern
and eastern provinces. In consequence
of this rumour, their commi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tee of observa∣tion
have transmitted dispatches to Pennysyl∣vania,
Maryland, Virginia, and other places,
desiring immediate assistance should such an
event take place. How <HI>our</HI> patriots will act
in this business I know not: for my part I
suspect there are people who industriously
circulate reports, and magnify the most
<PB N="209" REF="257"/>
trivial circumstances, with a view to in∣flame
the minds of the multitude. Men
of this complexion, are best gratified when
by somenting divisions, and exciting ap∣prehensions,
they are enabled to take the
lead in the subversion of all order, and by
obtaining an iniquitous pre-eminence,
<Q>Ride in the tempest, and direct the storm.”</Q></P>

<P>We are incessantly alarmed with varied
accounts from the northward, full of incon∣sistency
and contradiction; but upon the
whole there is the greatest reason to con∣clude,
that the action between the regulars
and provincials, has not been attended with
consequences so fatal as has been industri∣ously
represented. We are, however, still
in the dark with respect to authentic par∣ticulars.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="258"/>
The governor last night received a cir∣cular
letter from Lord Dartmouth, with a
resolution of the House of Commons, rela∣tive
to a conciliatory plan. I pray God it
may be attended with efficacy, though I
fear the unhappy event at Lexington will
retard the accomplishment of peace.</P>
<P>I am heartily disgusted with the times.
The universal cry is <HI>Liberty!</HI> to support
which, an infinite number of petty tyran∣nies
are established, under the appellation
of committees; in every one of which a
few despots lord it over the calm and mo∣derate;
inflame the passions of the mob,
and pronounce those to be enemies to the
general good, who may presume any way
to dissent from the creed they have thought
proper to impose.</P>
<P>Our provincial convention rose this day;
and, considering the complexion of the
times, their proceedings have been regular
<PB N="211" REF="259"/>
and moderate. The eleventh instant is to
be observed as a fast throughout this pro∣vince:
the mustering is to be continued;
and a sum is to be raised in each county,
for the support of the delegates in Phila∣delphia.</P>
<P>From the public prints it is difficult to
form a clear idea of the prevailing opinion
at home, respecting the present unhappy
and unnatural contention. If determined
measures are pursued, under officers of ap∣proved
trust and ability, it can hardly be
imagined that the colonies will be equal to
a long and serious opposition; but whe∣ther
a reduction of them by force would
be attended with the desired consequences,
is a question that ought to be considered in
preference to every other object. It will
surely be adviseable on the part of the Bri∣tish
commanders, to act only on defensive
principles, until every lenient method has
<PB N="212" REF="260"/>
been adopted to restore harmony and mu∣tual
confidence on a constitutional founda∣tion.
It is evident there are too many in∣dividuals,
in every province, who, from
interested or ambitious motives, embrace
all opportunities to foment the seeds of di∣vision,
by inflammatory addresses to the
passions of the multitude, by repeated mis∣representations,
and by artfully delineating
the miseries of that arbitrary system which
they assert, will be the inevitable conse∣quence
of submission to ministerial man∣dates.
Yet there are, also, throughout
this continent, many respectable charac∣ters,
whose real importance and establish∣ed
reputation, give them such due weight
and influence, that I cannot but indulge
the pleasing idea they will, by the steadi∣ness
and consistency of their conduct, be
able to stem the torrent excited by fac∣tious
artifices, and to forward measures
that may be essential to the interests
<PB N="213" REF="261"/>
and happiness of the united British Em∣pire.</P>
<P>Supported by this hope, those who are
sincerely attached to the prosperity and
welfare of the general community, direct
their best attention to the parent state.
Under the evils that now oppress them,
they derive some consolation from a firm
persuasion, that the olive-branch will
speedily be extended, and that such wise
and judicious dispositions will be made
for future legislation in the colonies; that
many inestimable advantages will arise from
past and present calamities.</P>
<P><DATE>May 13.</DATE></P>
<P>At length we have received General
Gage's account of the late action, which
is materially different from those transmit∣ted
by the respective committees; and, I
<PB N="214" REF="262"/>
think, may be more certainly relied on,
being written ten days after the engage∣ment,
when the particulars relative to the
whole transaction were properly and mi∣nutely
collected. The charge of cruelty
and precipitation is now retorted on the
provincials. But the patriots yield no
credit to this relation; though they affect
to believe implicitly every report propa∣gated
to the disadvantage of the British
forces.</P>
<P>The Members of the Congress are now
assembled in Philadelphia. I need not say
with what anxiety we attend the event of
their deliberations. The governor con∣tinues
to stand fair with the people of this
province; our public prints declare him to
be the only person, in his station, who, in
these tumultuous times, has given admi∣nistration
a fair and impartial representa∣tion
of important occurrences; and I can
<PB N="215" REF="263"/>
assert with the strictest regard to truth,
that he conducts himself, in his arduous
department, with an invariable attention to
the interests of his royal master, and the
essential welfare of the province over which
he has the honour to preside.</P>

<P>Annapolis, <DATE>July 25, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>MR. D—will do me the favour to
deliver this letter. He is going to
pass some time on the continent of Eu∣rope,
where he hopes to find that tranquil∣lity
which is not, at present, to be obtain∣ed
in this unhappy country. I shall leave
him to represent, minutely, the calamitous
situation of the colonies. Government is
now almost totally annihilated, and power
<PB N="216" REF="264"/>
transferred to the multitude. Speech is
become dangerous; letters are intercept∣ed;
confidence betrayed; and every mea∣sure
evidently tends to the most fatal ex∣tremities:
the sword is drawn, and, with∣out
some providential change of measures,
the blood of thousands will be shed in this
unnatural contest.</P>
<P>Before this letter is received, you will have
heard of the action at <HI>Bunker's Hill.</HI> The
provincials were forced from their intrench∣ments;
but it is said the regulars suffered
so severely, that they cannot afford to ob∣tain
future advantages at so dear a price.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this province are in∣corporated
under military regulations; and
apply the greater part of their time to the
different branches of discipline. In An∣napolis
there are two complete companies;
in Baltimore seven; and in every district
of this province the majority of the people
<PB N="217" REF="265"/>
are actually under arms: almost every hat
is decorated with a cockade; and the chur∣lish
drum and fife are the only music of
the times.</P>
<P>I have not yet, in positive terms, been
required to muster; and, I trust, my pe∣culiar
circumstances will be considered as
a reasonable plea of exemption. I wish well
to America.—It is my duty—my inclina∣tion
so to do—but I cannot—I will not—
consent to act in direct opposition to my oath
of allegiance, and my deliberate opinion.
Rather than submit to a conduct so base, so
inconsistent with my principles, I will give
up all—embrace ruin!—and trust to the
protecting care of Providence for the future
disposition of me and mine.</P>
<P>On Tuesday the 18th instant, a num∣ber
of armed persons set fire to a ship which
had accidentally run on ground a few miles
below this city. She was the property of
<PB N="218" REF="266"/>
Mr. Gildart of Liverpool, and had brought
in some goods contrary to the association.
This is the second burnt-offering to liberty
within this province: at the same time, it
is but justice to confess, that these instances
of popular fury are heartily condemned by
very many, even of the patriotic party.</P>
<P>Mr, James C—, a respectable mer∣chant
of Baltimore, lately addressed a let∣ter
to a near relation, Lieutenant-Co∣lonel
C—of the 60th regiment, sta∣tioned
in the island of Antigua, in which
he strongly expressed his disapprobation of
the prevailing system. This letter has been
intercepted and laid before the committee
of Baltimore county; and on its being
made public, his house was surrounded by
a disorderly rabble, and had not a detach∣ment
of the militia interfered, Mr. C—
would probably have fallen a sacrifice. This
gentleman is now a close prisoner, under
<PB N="219" REF="267"/>
the custody of a guard, and his case is to
be laid before the provincial convention,
who meet to-morrow, in this city, for the
purpose of establishing new regulations.</P>
<P>The proclamation issued by General
Gage is very little regarded. Hancock
and Adams are therein excepted from mer∣cy!—
The Congress have adjourned until
September.</P>
<P>My friend M—arrived on the 18th,
and delivered your circumstantial epistle.
How we are to correspond hereafter I
know not. On the tenth of September
next the non-exportation association takes
place; and all commercial intercourse will
consequently cease, until these unhappy
differences are by some means decided. It
seems but yesterday that I considered my
situation as permanent.—Every flattering
prospect appeared before me.—Happy in
my family, in my connexions, in my cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="220" REF="268"/>
cherished and supported by a
patron, able and anxious to promote my
interest. Alas! my brethren, how cru∣elly
is the scene reversed! I am suddenly
involved in a train of difficulties and dan∣gers,
against which no human prudence or
foresight could possibly guard. How
strangely complicated have been the events
of my life, on which, apparently, my own
conduct has had so little influence. Under
all circumstances believe me ever yours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Aug. 24, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>ON the fourteenth instant, the Con∣vention
concluded their delibe∣rations.
If their proceedings are published
before I have an opportunity to transmit
<PB N="221" REF="269"/>
this, I will enclose them for your informa∣tion.
You will then be enabled to form
an opinion of the disposition of this pro∣vince.</P>
<P>When you have perused the association
of the freemen of Maryland, you will, I
presume, acknowledge the propriety of my
objecting to subscribe to it, and acknow∣ledge
that such conduct would be incon∣sistent
with my principles, and the station
under government, in which I am situated.
I verily believed some regard would have
been paid to the particular circumstances
of revenue officers, but our present rulers
entertain different sentiments, and all per∣sons,
without exception, must associate and
enrol; the Governor, and his household,
<HI>only</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>His Excellency, ever attentive to my in∣terest,
has generously made me an offer to
become one of his family, immediately after
the embarkation of Mrs. E—, who is
<PB N="222" REF="270"/>
now anxiously preparing for her approach∣ing
voyage. We had firmly determined,
that no circumstances, however adverse to
our hopes, should induce us again to con∣sent,
even to a temporary separation; but
the cruel necessity of our once more sub∣mitting
to it, has of late appeared too
evident. She is perfectly convinced, that
I must speedily avow my political senti∣ments,
in the most explicit manner; and
that my refusal to join in the popular mea∣sures,
will subject me to inconveniences
which may better be supported, when my
family is removed to some secure asylum.
Influenced by such forcible considerations,
she has acknowledged the expediency of
what is so distressing to our domestic hap∣piness!
and early in the ensuing month,
we must bid farewell!—a painful farewell
to each other!</P>
<P>The Governor's humane and generous
offer impresses my mind with the most
<PB N="223" REF="271" MS="y"/>
lively gratitude: yet am I greatly embar∣rassed
how to conduct myself on the occa∣sion.
Considering the wild, unsettled times,
he is uncommonly popular; but how long
he may continue so is a matter of great
uncertainty. It is highly probable he may
speedily think it necessary to express his
decided approbation of the present pro∣ceedings,
which step, I am fearful, would
effectually cancel his past merits; subject
him to calumny and censure; and render his
longer continuance in Maryland impossible.
Should the event prove these conjectures
to be well-founded, I cannot possibly ex∣pect
protection from the friendly attention
of my worthy patron; on the contrary, I
must either bid adieu to America, and every
pleasing prospect, or meanly comply with
the requisitions of the Convention, in direct
opposition to the sentiments of my heart.
Let me weigh both evils, with a settled
determination to make that election which
<PB N="224" REF="272"/>
will hereafter be attended with the most
salutary effects, and the most pleasing re∣flections.</P>
<P>If I abandon this country, in conse∣quence
of a steady adherence to my prin∣ciples
and my duty, I must unavoidably be
subjected to a precarious life of uncertainty
and dependence; and instead of enjoying a
comfortable asylum in my native land, I
may only experience a variety of misfor∣tunes
and disappointments, and drink yet
deeper draughts of the cup of affliction. I
am, however, perfectly assured, if I preserve
my integrity unblemished, though I should
thereby be subjected to
<Q><L>“—the spurns</L>
<L>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,”</L></Q>
yet, hereafter, I shall receive an adequate
reward.</P>
<P>On the other hand, should I act in oppo∣sition
to the dictates of my mind, by sub∣scribing
to the association, and taking arms,
<PB N="225" REF="273"/>
I shall not only be subject to those pain∣ful
feelings which accompany a consci∣ousness
of doing wrong, but be justly de∣spised
by every brave and honest man;
detested and avoided by every respectable
society; and, when tranquillity is happily
restored, deservedly cast out, to encounter
a complication of miseries, without one
chearing thought to support such a reverse
of fortune.</P>
<P>I have now fairly stated my situation;
and believe, from your knowledge of
my principles, you will readily determine
how I shall regulate my conduct; and
whenever I am unhappily necessitated to
quit this country, where I have experi∣enced
great blessings, this pleasing reflec∣tion
will accompany me, that I have left
behind me a fair and unblemished reputa∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="274"/>
A new emission of paper currency, to
the amount of sixty thousand pounds sterl∣ing,
is now preparing under the inspec∣tion
of gentlemen, appointed by authority
of the Convention, which is hereafter to be
sunk by a tax on the inhabitants of this pro∣vince;
besides which, they are to be assessed
their proportion to sink the Congress mo∣ney,
amounting to six hundred and seventy
five thousand pounds, lately emitted at
Philadelphia, for the payment of the pro∣vincial
army. How these enormous ex∣pences
are to be supported, and how the
people are to be maintained, after a total
stagnation of commerce, is not easy to con∣ceive.
If ways and means are not speedily
devised to feed the hungry, and cloath the
naked, we must assuredly experience all the
horrors of the most extreme indigence.</P>
<P>Numbers of my valued friends are now
preparing to bid farewell to a country,
<PB N="227" REF="275"/>
where they cannot possibly remain with any
degree of safety, unless they take an active
part in opposition to the measures of go∣vernment:
to be neuter is to be adverse.
What a variety of circumstances combine
to make me wretched! It is but too proba∣ble
that <HI>I</HI> also shall soon abandon this con∣tinent,
either by sentence of banishment,
or by voluntary retreat. I cannot be ex∣celled
by any in good wishes to Ame∣rica,
and I heartily pray that every real evil
under which she labours, may be speedily
and effectually redressed: but the present
measures will never meet my concurrence:
I cannot subscribe to a compact, which I
believe to be incompatible with my oath of
allegiance; nor can I think it consistent
with that liberty, which is the universal cry,
to compel any man to act in direct opposi∣tion
to his well-grounded principles.</P>
<P>I have written you a gloomy letter, which
a word or two more shall conclude. In a
<PB N="228" REF="276"/>
former epistle, I mentioned Mr. James
C—, and the danger to which he was
subjected in consequence of having im∣parted
his opinions too explicitly in con∣fidential
correspondence. That gentleman
has been examined by the Convention, and
there are vindictive spirits who think the
sentence he has received, by no means ade∣quate
to the <HI>supposed</HI> enormity of his of∣fence.
He has been pronounced “an
enemy to America; condemned to perpe∣tual
banishment; and obliged to deposit
the sum of five hundred pounds sterling,
in the hands of persons appointed by the
Convention, to be expended occasionally to∣wards
his proportion of all charges incur∣red,
or to be incurred, for the defence of
America, during the present contest with
Great Britain; the overplus, if any, after
a reconciliation shall happily be effected,
to be restored to the said James C—.”</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="277"/>
From this you will learn how hazardous
it is become to support a free intercourse.
The Convention have thus assumed the
powers of all the different branches of go∣vernment;
but with what propriety, it be∣comes
not me to determine. That the
blessings of peace may speedily be restored,
is the fervent prayer of your faithful, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Sep. 26th, 1775.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM seated, my dearest wife, to trans∣mit
a detail of material occurrences,
since our unhappy separation on the six∣teenth
instant.</P>
<P>It is impossible to delineate the anguish
I experienced when I quitted the vessel
<PB N="230" REF="278"/>
which was to convey you, and our darling
boy to a land of safety. Anxious to retain
you as long as possible in my possession, I
had proceeded with you further down the
Bay than prudence warranted, and the
night was far advanced before I regained
the mansion of the hospitable Colonel. I
then retired to the apartment you had so
recently quitted, and gave a loose to all the
complicated emotions which “harrowed
up my soul.”</P>
<P>On the nineteenth, the wind being fa∣vourable,
I took leave of the worthy family
at Rousley-hall, and embarked for Anna∣polis.
In my way down the river I visited
a vessel which had anchored near the mouth
on the preceding evening, and found on
board several of our valued acquaintance,
who had abandoned their dearest connexions,
rather than assent to measures they could
not conscientiously support.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="279"/>
Immediately on landing, I repaired to
my new abode at the Governor's, who
received me with that friendly attention
which so remarkably distinguishes his con∣duct
on every occasion. I found him in
company with a few select loyal friends:
political occurrences engrossed our conver∣sation,
in which hope appeared to operate
but weakly, with respect to the eventful
transactions of the times. At an early hour
we separated: my apartment was ready for
my reception; and after invoking Heaven
on behalf of my wife and son, I rested
with tolerable composure.</P>
<P>Mr. L—, who had actually em∣barked
for England, with full permission
from the ruling powers, has been obliged
to relinquish his intention, and return on
shore, some clamours having been excited
by the populace to his prejudice; and it
being thought necessary he should remain
<PB N="232" REF="280"/>
to vindicate his conduct. Many of our
friends have found it expedient to take a
French leave. I trust you will speedily
meet them in perfect safety.</P>
<P>On the twentieth, I visited our once
happy mansion. This was an additional
trial of resignation and fortitude; every
surrounding object too forcibly reminding
me of past felicity. Your servants shewed
the strongest sensibility; and their earnest
and pathetic inquiries relative to their dear
mistress and our beloved boy, proved the
fervency and sincerity of their attachment.
In a few days they remove to their respec∣tive
situations. What a dreadful reverse
have I already experienced!</P>
<P><DATE>Septem. 26th, <HI>P. M.</HI></DATE></P>
<P>About an hour since, the governor was
exceedingly surprised by the receipt of a
letter from Mr. L—. D—, dated from
Philadelphia. The contents intimate, that
<PB N="233" REF="281"/>
on the tenth and eleventh instant they en∣countered
a most violent storm, about sixty
leagues to the eastward of Virginia, during
which the Annapolis lost all her masts;
and that they continued three days in that
dangerous situation, before they were able
to fix-jury masts, under which they made
sail for the coast of America. On Tues∣day,
the nineteenth, they had the good
fortune to fall in with a vessel bound to
Philadelphia, which received the passen∣gers,
and conveyed them to that city. Cap∣tain
H—intends to go into the first
port he can make, in order to repair his
damages, which are considerable. I need
not observe, that we wait for intelligence
of his arrival with great anxiety.</P>
<P>We once considered the circumstances
which prevented your sailing in that ship,
as a very severe disappointment; but in
consequence of that seeming evil, what
<PB N="234" REF="282"/>
inconveniences, what terrors, have you not
happily avoided! what increased expence!
which in our present situation we are little
able to support.</P>
<P>Wednesday evening, <DATE>Sep. 27.</DATE></P>
<P>This morning early we were alarmed by
the beating of drums, and a proclamation
for the inhabitants to assemble at the Li∣berty
Tree. The purport of this meeting
was to obtain a resolve, “That all persons
who had refused to sign the association,
and comply with the other requisitions,
should be obliged to quit the city, as ene∣mies
to the essential interests of America.”
I have, however, the pleasure to inform
you, that this violent project was defeated
with little difficulty: every judicious and
reasonable person seeing through the per∣nicious
tendency of such a design; and
the promoters, who were amongst the
lowest of the people, not being supported
<PB N="235" REF="283"/>
or encouraged. It is needless to mention,
that this proceeding was directly opposite to
the resolves of the Convention; it having
been determined by that body, that <HI>they only</HI>
were competent to take cognizance of of∣fences,
and to ascertain the punishment.</P>
<P>I am, however, clearly of opinion, that
all power will quickly be transferred into
the hands of the multitude, who once tak∣ing
the lead, will not easily be reduced again
to proper submission. In some counties
they have had warm contests in electing
their delegates for the ensuing convention,
and in appointing members of the respec∣tive
committees. In Talbot, the poll lasted
several days; party prejudices were highly
predominant, and much ill blood produced.</P>
<P>Mr. R—, the Attorney General of
Virginia, with his lady and daughters, are
on their passage to England. His son is of
the adverse party, and is appointed an aid-du-camp
<PB N="236" REF="284"/>
to General Washington; with
whom, beneath the hospitable roof of our
worthy governor, I have so frequently shared
the hour of social and sentimental discourse.
Little did I then conceive, that he was des∣tined
to be called forth, by the united voice
of America, from the private occupations
of domestic tranquillity, to direct hostile
operations against the measures of the Bri∣tish
government. Reserved in conversa∣tion,
but liberal in opinion, his actions
have, hitherto, been directed by calmness
and moderation; a perseverance in which
conduct may restrain misguided ardor, and
direct every movement to that grand point;
a permanent and constitutional reconcilia∣tion.</P>
<P>The exaltation of this gentleman to the
supreme command, is considered as a se∣vere
stroke to the ambition of General
Lee; who, relying on a supposed opinion
<PB N="237" REF="285"/>
of his superior abilities and experience,
expected to have been unanimously chosen
to this elevated station. I am persuad∣ed,
that General Washington would re∣joice
in an opportunity of returning into
the private walks of life: but it is too
evident that General Lee is governed by a
vindictive spirit, the result of disappoint∣ment
in military advancement, while in the
service of Great Britain. Perhaps this ad∣ditional
mortification may moderate his
zeal in the cause he has recently espoused.</P>
<P>The Council of Safety have given di∣rections
to several gentlemen in public de∣partments,
to hold themselves in readiness
to remove their books and papers. Inti∣mations
of this nature have not yet ex∣tended
to myself or colleague, but when
the Convention meet, it is expected we
shall be included in whatever regulations
they may think necessary to establish.</P>

The report of a ship of war being or∣dered
to this port; has occasioned many
families to quit Annapolis; and others talk
of removing speedily. I have, however,
the pleasure of informing you, that the
generality of the inhabitants seem perfectly
disposed to conduct themselves with mo∣deration,
should such ship arrive; for at a
respectable meeting of the citizens, on
Monday last, it was unanimously agreed,
“If a vessel, belonging to his Majesty,
should be stationed in our harbour, to
supply the same with every necessary,
at a reasonable price, and cautiously to
avoid any cause of contention with the
officers or the crew.” An address is
also prepared to be delivered to the Gover∣nor,
expressive of these laudable sentiments,
and entreating that he will intimate the
same to the commander of any ship that
may be ordered on this duty.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="287"/>
I shall be truly impatient till I learn that
you are safely arrived. May the wished-for
intelligence be soon conveyed to your
ever faithful, &amp;c.</P>

<P>WHEN we parted, I intimated an
intention of making an excursion
to the northward; but, on reflection, think
it prudent, during these discordant times,
to relinquish the design. The city of New
York is deserted by almost every respectable
family; and Philadelphia only presents a
view of military arrangements and general
confusion. While the country is in such
commotion, commerce and agriculture at
a stand, and marks of distress, real or ima∣ginary,
<PB N="240" REF="288"/>
imprinted on every countenance,
it is absolutely impossible to receive any sa∣tisfaction
from change of situation.</P>
<P>The king's proclamation, and the Man∣chester
address, have appeared in the con∣tinental
papers; but as I carefully avoid
“the busy haunts of men,” I am not suf∣ficiently
informed to determine on their
general reception. From what I casually
learn they do not tend to conciliate.</P>
<P>Friday, <DATE>Nov. 17.</DATE></P>
<P>I have just received intelligence which
gives me great disquietude. The Septem∣ber
packet is arrived from England, but
the letters are detained for inspection. The
governor is much chagrined on the occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Washington, accompanied by her
son Mr. Curtis, and his lady, passed through
Baltimore this day on their way to the
<PB N="241" REF="289"/>
camp at Cambridge, escorted by a detach∣ment
of horse, that made a very military
appearance.</P>
<P>Tuesday, <DATE>Nov. 21.</DATE></P>
<P>The governor this morning received his
letters, but they have passed the ordeal of
examination. Those you may write to me
will assuredly share the same fate. It is a
painful reflection, that private correspon∣dence
cannot escape being subjected to
public investigation; but we must yield
with resignation to the complexion of the
times.</P>
<P>Annapolis is daily more and more de∣serted;
some families have quitted us from
apprehensions of a bombardment; others
on account of the distressed times, bad
markets, and a general scarcity of money;
even tradesmen and mechanics have quit∣ted
their habitations, and are retired from
<PB N="242" REF="290"/>
the vicinity of navigable waters. Agricul∣ture
is neglected; the voice of peaceful in∣dustry
is heard no more; and the military
science is the universal study, so that I
have, every hour, additional reason to fe∣licitate
myself on your absence from this
wretched country.</P>
<P>Monday, <DATE>Nov. 27.</DATE></P>
<P>A hand-bill is just arrived from the
northward, which conveys information,
that the metropolis of Canada has surren∣dered
to Colonel Arnold, by the reduction
of which an immense quantity of military
stores has fallen into the possession of the
captors. The acount says fifteen thou∣sand
stand of arms, and two thousand five
hundred barrels of gunpowder, with can∣non,
mortars, &amp;c. Fifteen thousand suits
of soldiers clothing are also said to be
included in this valuable capture. Ge∣neral
<PB N="243" REF="291"/>
Carleton is at Montreal, but with
what force is not ascertained; it is how∣ever
imagined that place must inevitably
fall, and the gallant commander submit to
the provincial armament. War between
different nations is an evil of great magni∣tude;
but between people who acknow∣ledge
the same sovereign, who speak the
same language, profess the same religion,
and who are connected with each other by
all the affecting ties of nature and of interest,
it is indeed too horrible for imagination to
conceive.</P>
<P>In consequence of the late success, our
patriots talk in a strain of high exultation;
and prognosticate events fatal to the poli∣tical
and commercial interests of the pa∣rent
state.</P>
<P>As it is impossible during these unsettled
times, to conjecture what fortune may be∣fall
me, I would have you be constantly pre∣pared
<PB N="244" REF="292"/>
for my arrival in London, as it may
not be in my power to transmit you any
information previous to my leaving this
country. For if peace is not re-establish∣ed
during the course of the present winter,
I can neither enjoy happiness, nor derive
any advantage by remaining in America.</P>
<P>These wretched times indeed strike at
the root of every home-felt enjoyment;
every countenance is darkened with anxiety
and suspicion; mutual confidence is anni∣hilated;
political prejudices erase the re∣membrance
of former attachments, and
friends and kindred forget the endearing
bonds of amity and love.</P>

<P>WERE I to yield to those corrod∣ing

form the most calamitous ideas, respecting
the events which may, too probably, take
place before the commencement of a fu∣ture

it is possible all may yet be well. Tran∣quillity
may be effectually restored; we
may be happily re-united, and enabled to

which, through paths of danger, conducts

<P><PB N="248" REF="296"/>
For some time I have indulged the idea
that the November packet would convey
the pleasing intelligence of your safe arrival
in London; and that you were enjoying as
much satisfaction as the restoration of
health, and the attention of kind friends
could possibly afford. But, alas! I am
miserably disappointed; by the painful in∣formation
that, from October last, no more
packets were to be dispatched regularly
from England. It is, therefore, now be∣come
a doubt, whether I shall obtain in∣formation
of your welfare, until it pleases
heaven to restore you, and our dearest child,
to my impatient arms.</P>
<P>Since your departure, what a strange al∣teration
has taken place. Our harbours—
our rivers are deserted. The chearful sound
of industry is heard no more; activity is
only exerted in warlike preparations: every
visage is clouded with apprehension; and
<PB N="249" REF="297"/>
a continued succession of aggravated re∣ports
agitate the mind, and foment the
general discontent. Were my duty, and my
inclination reconcileable with each other,
you would speedily behold me in England;
but every motive of principle and affection
equally operates to deny the gratification of
my fondest wishes. For while a possibility
remains that a reconciliation may be con∣stitutionally
effected between Great Bri∣tain
and her colonies, it is, undoubtedly,
incumbent on the servants of government
not to relinquish their respective situati∣ons.
Such conduct would be justly re∣prehensible,
as it might occasion infinite
irregularity and confusion; which by a
decent and steady perseverance may be
avoided. I am persuaded these reasons will
have their due influence on your mind,
and, in a great degree, prepare you to
encounter those evils, which I would even
yet hope are but temporary.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 16, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>AFFAIRS in Virginia have borne,
for some time, a very serious as∣pect.
On the 25th of October last, Lord
Dunmore cannonaded Hampton, a com∣mercial
town on the banks of the Chesa∣peak,
but was repulsed with the loss of
some men and a tender, which was taken
by the militia. In consequence of this
transaction, on the 7th of November, a pro∣clamation
was issued by his lordship, dated
on board the ship William, lying off Nor∣fok,
declaring, “that as the civil law was
insufficient, at that period, to prevent and
<PB N="251" REF="299"/>
punish treason, martial law should take
place, and be executed throughout the
colony; therefore requiring all persons
capable of bearing arms, to repair to his
majesty's standard, or to be considered
as traytors. He also declared all in∣dented
servants, negroes, or others ap∣pertaining
to persons in opposition to
government, who were able and willing
to bear arms, and who joined his ma∣jesty's
forces, to be free.”</P>
<P>This measure of emancipating the ne∣groes
has excited an universal ferment, and
will, I apprehend, greatly strengthen the
general confederacy.</P>
<P>The proclamation, however, had some
immediate effect in the opulent town of
Norfolk, where many of the inhabitants
were well affected to government. The
governor was speedily joined by some hun∣dreds
of all complexions, and he doubt∣less
<PB N="252" REF="300"/>
formed an idea, that the disposition
to loyalty, which he discovered in that
neighbourhood, would have been suffici∣ently
general for enabling him to raise a
force competent to re-establish, what he
deemed a proper degree of subordination.</P>
<P>This delusive expectation was interrupt∣ed
by information, that a party of provin∣cials,
under the command of Colonel
Woodford, were on their march to oppose
his measures. To obstruct their progress,
and to support those who were well-affected,
Lord Dunmore immediately took possession
of a post called the Great Bridge, some miles
distant from Norfolk, which is a pass of
great consequence, and the only practicable
way of approaching that town. Both par∣ties
fortified themselves within cannon shot
of each other; and as a narrow causeway
lay between them, which must necessarily
be passed previous to an attack, they ap∣peared
<PB N="253" REF="301"/>
to be mutually secured from any
danger of surprise.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, they continued in∣active
several days, till, at length, a de∣sign
was formed of surprising the Ameri∣can
troops in their intrenchments. Cap∣tain
Fordyce, a very gallant officer, at the
head of about sixty grenadiers, led the at∣tack:
they passed the causeway with the
utmost intrepidity, and with fixed bayo∣nets
rushed on an enemy, who were pro∣perly
prepared for their reception; for
Captain Fordyce's party were not only ex∣posed,
naked, to a heavy fire in front,
but were enfiladed from another part of
the works. The brave leader, with seve∣ral
of his men, fell; the lieutenant, with
the residue, all of whom were severely
wounded, were taken prisoners.</P>
<P>The fire of the artillery from the British
fort, enabled the forces under the com∣mand
<PB N="254" REF="302"/>
of the governor, to retreat from
the post which they had occupied, and
which was now no longer tenable, with∣out
pursuit; and as all hopes in this quar∣ter
were terminated by the defeat, Lord
Dunmore thought it expedient to abandon
the town and neighbourhood of Norfolk,
and retire on board the shipping, with
numbers of persons, who having been ac∣tive
in supporting his measures, found it
necessary to seek the same asylum. A con∣siderable
number of vessels was, by this
means, collected, crowded with people and
effects; but possessing little force and in
great want of able mariners. The pro∣vincials
immediately took possession of
Norfolk, and the governor, with his ad∣herents,
removed to a greater distance.</P>
<P>The loyalists who had taken refuge in
the fleet, together with the seamen and
military, quickly became sensible of many
<PB N="255" REF="303"/>
difficulties and hardships; provisions, ne∣cessaries,
and every kind of succour, being
absolutely denied from the adjacent shore.
The ships, likewise, being constantly an∣noyed
by the fire of the Americans, from
that part of the town which lay nearest
the water, it was determined to dislodge
them, by destroying it. A flag, however,
was first sent on shore, to learn “whether
the provincials would regularly supply
his Majesty's ships with water and pro∣visions,”
which requisition being an∣swered
in the negative, extremities were
resolved on. Previous notice being ac∣cordingly
given, that the inhabitants might
remove to situations of security, the first
day of the present year was signalized by
the attack; when a violent cannonading
commenced from the Liverpool frigate,
two sloops of war, and the Governor's
armed ship, the Dunmore; supported by
parties of the sailors and marines, who
<PB N="256" REF="304"/>
landed, and set fire to the nearest houses.
These measures soon produced the intended
effect; but not without the destruction of
the whole town, which by the rapid pro∣gress
of the flames, was quickly reduced
to ashes.</P>
<P>I have seen the copy of a gazette, which
was printed on board the Governor's ship,
he having removed the press and materials
thither from Norfolk, in which it is con∣fidently,
and with great probability asserted,
“that it was only intended to destroy that
part of the town which adjoined the
river, but that the provincials com∣pleted
the devastation, by setting fire
to the remote streets; which, as the
wind then stood, would otherwise have
been secure from danger.”</P>
<P>Such has been the fate of the most con∣siderable
commercial town in the colony
of Virginia; and the whole loss upon the
occasion, is estimated at above three hun∣dred
<PB N="257" REF="305"/>
thousand pounds. This unhappy
event has given a fresh alarm to our citi∣zens,
many of whom are preparing to quit
Annapolis.</P>
<P>The Provincial Assembly have been sit∣ting
here, ever since the fourth of Decem∣ber.
It is expected they will speedily ad∣journ.</P>
<P>Our Governor is in perfect health. He
still continues to receive every external
mark of attention and respect; while the
steady propriety of his conduct, in many
trying exigencies, reflects the utmost cre∣dit
on his moderation and understanding.</P>
<P>My ignorance of your situation, is a very
considerable addition to the disquietude I
experience, on account of public calami∣ties.
May my next acknowledge the re∣ceipt
of an epistle from her who occupies
every thought; and whose happiness is the

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>March 14th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>THE inhabitants of this city have
been exceedingly alarmed. On the
fifth instant, about eight in the evening,
intelligence was received, that a ship of
war was on her passage up the bay; and at
no great distance from Annapolis. The
consternation occasioned by this informa∣tion,
exceeds description. The night was
tempestuous; extremely dark; and the
rain descended in torrents: notwithstanding
which, many persons began to remove their
effects; and the streets were quickly crowded
<PB N="259" REF="307"/>
with carriages laden with furniture, and
property of various kinds. A little reflec∣tion
must have made it evident, that with∣out
violent provocation, hostilities would
not have commenced: and at all events,
that timely notice would have been given,
previous to any bombardment. It ought
to have been considered, that a governor,
acting under the authority of Great Britain,
was resident in the town, and, apparently,
exercising the powers with which he was
invested. No complaint had been trans∣mitted,
on his part, relative to the treat∣ment
experienced by him, and the adhe∣rents
of administration. His prudent and
consistent conduct, had greatly tended to
prevent personal outrages; and under such
circumstances, it was manifest, that no
commander in his Majesty's service, could
have formed the most distant idea of pro∣ceeding
to extremities, without commu∣nicating
<PB N="260" REF="308"/>
his intentions to the supreme
magistrate, who was undoubtedly a valua∣ble
pledge in the hands of the people, to
secure themselves and property from imme∣diate
violence.</P>
<P>But as reason seldom operates under
instantaneous impressions, the Governor
resolved to pursue every eligible method
that might effectually remove the appre∣hensions
so universally entertained. Actu∣ated
by such motives, he made immediate
application to the Council of Safety, and,
in order to dissipate the general anxiety,
proposed sending a flag of truce on board
his Majesty's ship, the instant she made
her appearance, or came to an anchor off
the harbour. An offer so evidently tending
to preserve the public tranquillity, was ac∣cepted
with every suitable acknowledg∣ment;
and on the seventh instant, a ship
of war, accompanied by a tender, passing
<PB N="261" REF="309"/>
by Annapolis, I had the honour to be de∣puted
to perform this service; on which
occasion I thought it necessary, in order to
obviate any misrepresentation, to transcribe,
as follows, the substance of my negotiation,
for the inspection of the Governor, the
Council of Safety, and the Committee of
Observation.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Friday, <DATE>March 8th.</DATE></P>
<P>“By order of his Excellency the Gover∣nor,”
and with the approbation of the pre∣sident
of the Council of Safety, I repaired
yesterday on board his Majesty's sloop, the
Otter, commanded by Captain Squire, then
lying at an anchor in Chesapeak Bay, be∣tween
Magotty River, and the Bodkin;
and delivered to him a letter from the Go∣vernor,
to which a satisfactory answer was
returned, and immediately made known,
for the general information of the citizens
of Annapolis.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="310"/>
“In conversation with Captain Squire,”
I took occasion to expatiate on the temper
and moderation of the people of Mary∣land;
their attachment to the British con∣stitution;
and their settled aversion to any
design of establishing an independency: for
an assurance of which, I referred him to
the instructions given to their delegates in
Congress, and to the proceedings of the
late Convention.</P>
<P>“I informed Captain Squire,” that from
the commencement of these unhappy dis∣sentions,
the Governor and his friends had
been treated with respect and attention;
I recommended the utmost moderation in
the execution of his orders; and assured
him, that in so doing, the esteem of the
people would be so far conciliated, as to
render the Maryland station as convenient
and agreeable as the nature of the times
would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="311"/>
“Captain Squire,” on his part, expli∣citly
acquainted me, that it was the fur∣thest
from his intentions to proceed to any
extremities; that he was instructed to de∣mand
a privateer, avowedly fitted out at
Baltimore, for hostile purposes; as also
some vessels laden with flour, of which the
navy were in the greatest want; that he
was ready to pay the market price for any
provisions that the inhabitants would sup∣ply
him with; but otherwise he was under
an absolute necessity to seize whatever
might come within his power. Captain
Squire promised, that if his requisitions
were complied with, not the least damage
should ensue to any individual, or to the
town of Baltimore.</P>
<P>“Captain Squire mentioned,” that he had
given particular directions to the gentle∣men
under his command, not to fire, under
any pretext, upon such persons as might
<PB N="264" REF="312"/>
assemble on the adjacent shores, or permit
any depredations; but to perform such
duty only, as was absolutely essential to his
Majesty's service.</P>
<P>“Captain Squire,” from the whole of his
behaviour, discovered the utmost concern
for the unhappy breach which had taken
place between the mother country, and her
colonies; and obliged as he was, to act in
the line of his duty, it appeared his most
earnest wish to avoid any measures which
might only tend to widen the calamitous
dissention.</P>
<P>“To the above I have only to add,
that my business on board was to recom∣mend
temperate proceedings, and to ob∣tain
such intelligence as might conduce to
remove the apprehensions of the much
alarmed citizens of Annapolis, in which
service I have the satisfaction to believe I
have not been altogether unsuccessful.</P>

<P><PB N="265" REF="313"/>
Early in the afternoon, the armed ves∣sel,
of which they were in quest, appeared
in sight. The tender, belonging to the
sloop of war, had proceeded further up the
bay, and had taken possession of a ship,
with a valuable cargo, then lying at an
anchor, and ready for sea: but on the ap∣proach
of a force greatly superior, the cap∣tors
were reluctantly obliged to relinquish
their prize, and hasten to the Otter, with
intimation of their disappointment. Every
circumstance plainly indicated an intention,
on the part of the privateer, to attack his
Majesty's sloop; which immediately got
under way, in order to prepare for their
reception. While they were weighing,
I took leave of the captain and officers,
and repaired on board the schooner which
brought me from Annapolis, in firm ex∣pectation
that the action would commence
before I could possibly proceed far on my
return. Shortly after I quitted the Otter,
<PB N="266" REF="314"/>
she struck on a shoal, and heeled confidera∣bly,
in which situation she could have
made very little resistance, had the provin∣cial
commander thought it advisable to
have then availed himself of that op∣portunity.
She, however, quickly righted,
and stood for her opponent, who, possibly
in pursuance of orders, put about, and di∣rected
her course for Baltimore. Night
approaching, and the navigation being in∣tricate,
the Otter came again to an anchor
near the mouth of the Patapsco.</P>
<P>On the ninth, the Otter returned down
the bay, and anchored off the mouth of our
harbour; soon after which a flag of truce
was dispatched on shore. The officer who
brought it was received with respect; two
gentlemen of the Council of Safety were
present at the delivery of his message; and
the day was concluded at the Governor's,
in a sociable manner. During this inter∣val,
<PB N="267" REF="315"/>
the seamen who accompanied the offi∣cer
continued in their boat, at a small dis∣tance
from the shore, where they supported
a friendly conversation with the provincial
military, who were stationed on the beach
to preserve regularity.</P>
<P>Early on the ensuing day, another flag
attended the Governor, but continued with
him a very short time: and about noon,
the Otter made sail to join the fleet on the
Virginia station.</P>
<P>It was certainly a most happy circum∣stance,
that this visit was not attended with
more serious consequences. Had an action
taken place, which at one time appeared
too probable, whatever might have been
the event, factious and ambitious men
would eagerly have embraced the oppor∣tunity
to have fomented the general dis∣content.
The Defence, which is the name
of the armed ship fitted out at Baltimore,
is much superior in force to the Otter
<PB N="268" REF="316"/>
sloop, and was crouded with seamen and
volunteers, who appeared resolute and de∣termined.
Many are of opinion they acted
wisely in declining the contest. They had
retaken the prize, the avowed object of
their intentions; and admitting their claim
equal with respect to courage, added to the
circumstances of a superior force, these
advantages would, probably, by no means
have counterbalanced the acknowledged
activity and address, which so remarkably

<P>I am this day rendered happy by intel∣ligence

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>March 29th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>AN authentic account arrived this
day, that the British forces have
evacuated Boston, and that General Wash∣ington,
with the continental troops, had
taken possession. This important event took
place on the seventeenth instant. The rea∣sons
which rendered this measure necessary,
will probably reach England at an earlier
period than it will reach this part of America.
Various opinions are industriously circulat∣ed;
and some, who pretend to have inves∣tigated
<PB N="270" REF="318"/>
the real motives of this sudden and
unexpected event, consider the conduct of
Sir William Howe, as a preliminary to∣wards
a reconciliation.</P>
<P>The utmost credit is given to the British
general, for the propriety and regularity
with which he conducted the evacuation;
and though his design for some days had
been manifestly evident, the provincial army
continued quiet in their works, without
any efforts to obstruct the embarkation, or
to molest the rear. Several hundreds of
the inhabitants, whose attachment to Go∣vernment
had rendered them obnoxious,
have removed, with their families and ef∣fects,
on board the transports and ships of
war; and numerous conjectures are formed,
with respect to their destination. The sea∣son
of the year operates strongly against a
distant voyage. Beacons are, therefore,
established along the coast, to give the most
<PB N="271" REF="319"/>
immediate notice of their approach, should
a design be formed against any other part
of the continent, which the commanders
of his Majesty's forces may deem more
accessible. A short time must resolve
every doubt.</P>
<P>From present appearances, there are but
faint hopes of a speedy reconciliation.
Greater requisitions will assuredly be made,
than I fear, can consistently be complied
with. In political, as in moral events,
one evil imperceptibly leads to another.
The original limited boundary is cast far
behind; and new claims, and new pursuits,
are even sanctified by the fallacious plea
of justice and necessity. In Maryland, a
spirit of moderation is yet predominant;
and if an opinion may be formed from ge∣neral
appearances, every endeavour is di∣rected
to restore a constitutional connexion
with the parent state. But in several po∣pulous
<PB N="272" REF="320"/>
and powerful provinces, doctrines
are industriously promulgated, and eagerly
received, which will effectually bar every
avenue to a pacific accommodation; and
the most sanguine adherents to the interests
of Great Britain, cannot, with propriety,
indulge the faintest idea, that any single
colony, however influenced by circum∣stance
or inclination, can possibly pretend
to stem the torrent, should it unhappily
tend to the establishment of an independent
government.</P>
<P>From such considerations, I am naturally
led to believe, that the day cannot be far
distant, when it will be necessary for those
to abandon this country, who cannot con∣sistently
coincide with the popular mea∣sures.
Be, therefore, always prepared to
see me: and let not my sudden appearance
affect your mind too sensibly. On the
other hand, yield not to gloomy apprehen∣sions,
<PB N="273" REF="321"/>
if a considerable time should elapse,
without your receiving any intimation of
my welfare; and be not alarmed, when
reports are circulated relative to calamities
incident to war. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>May 20, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>THE Congress, by a declaration of
the fifteenth instant, have earnestly
recommended to “the respective assem∣blies
and conventions of the united co∣lonies,
where no government sufficient
to the exigencies of their affairs has
been hitherto established, to adopt such
government as shall in the opinion of
the representatives of the people best
<PB N="274" REF="322"/>
conduce to the happiness and safety of
their constituents, and America in ge∣neral.”
This declaration is grounded
on the prohibitory act, by which, “the in∣habitants
of British America are totally
excluded from the protection of the
crown.” “It is also alledged therein,
that no answer has been, or is like to be
returned to the humble petitions of the
colonies; but that instead of attending
to the redress of grievances, coercive
measures are adopted; by which the
whole force of the mother country, aid∣ed
by foreign mercenaries, is to be ex∣erted
for their destruction. From such
considerations, it is asserted to be abso∣lutely
irreconcileable to reason, and good
conscience, to take the oaths and affir∣mations
necessary for the support of any
government under the dominion of
Great Britain, and therefore expedient
that the exercise of every kind of au∣thority
<PB N="275" REF="323"/>
under the said crown, should be
totally suppressed, and all the powers of
government hereafter exerted under the
authority of the people of the colonies;
for the preservation of internal peace,
virtue, and good order; as well as for
the defence of their lives, liberties, and
properties, against the hostile invasions,
and cruel depredations of their enemies.”
Whether any of the provinces, by their
delegates in congress, have dissented from
a measure which must, inevitably, be pro∣ductive
of the most serious consequences,
has not yet been ascertained; but it is cer∣tain,
that the colony of Virginia has taken
a most decided lead in promoting a total
separation from Great Britain. For on
the same day in which congress came to
the resolution above-mentioned, the con∣vention
in Williamsburgh issued a similar
declaration, but expressed in such strong
and pointed terms, as evidently indicate a
<PB N="276" REF="324"/>
settled determination never to acknowledge
themselves in any degree subordinate to the
influence or authority of the British go∣vernment.</P>
<P>There were present that day in conven∣tion,
one hundred and twelve members,
who, after stating the reasons which in∣fluenced
their conduct, conclude with the
following <HI>unanimous</HI> resolution.</P>
<P>“That the delegates appointed to re∣present
this colony in general congress,
be instructed to propose to that respec∣table
body, <HI>to declare the United Colonies
free and independent States,</HI> absolved from
all allegiance to, or dependence upon
the crown, or parliament of Great Bri∣tain;
and that they give the assent of
this colony to such declaration, and to
whatever measures may be thought pro∣per
and necessary by the congress for
forming foreign alliances, and a confe∣deration
<PB N="277" REF="325"/>
of the colonies, at such time,
and in the same manner, as to them shall
seem best: PROVIDED, that the power
of forming government for, and the re∣gulations
of the internal concerns of
such colonies, be left to the respective
colonial legislatures.”</P>
<P>To very many this proceeding appears
extraordinary and premature; commissi∣oners
being daily expected to receive the
claims of the colonies; in order to adjust
and regulate the terms of reconciliation.
It is possible their powers may be ample;
surely their extent ought at least to be as∣certained,
previous to any decided mea∣sure,
which may preclude a possibility of
entering upon a negociation. In speaking
thus far, I but declare the sentiments of
many respectable individuals who have,
hitherto, taken a distinguished lead in op∣position
to the British legislature; and I
<PB N="278" REF="326"/>
most fervently hope, that the influence of
such men, in the different provinces, will
operate with sufficient efficacy to prevent
the final declaration of independence, until,
in their opinion, it becomes an unavoid∣able
expedient, and immediately necessary
for the interest, the happiness, and the
freedom of America.</P>
<P>Friday, <DATE>May 24.</DATE></P>
<P>Some events have recently taken place,
in which I am particularly interested, and
which will probably be attended with im∣portant
consequences to me and mine. But
that you may be enabled to form a proper
idea of my present critical situation, I must
relate some material circumstances, which
took place early in the preceding month.</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had some private
concerns with the Earl of Dunmore, ob∣tained
permission from the council of safety
<PB N="279" REF="327"/>
Maryland, to attend his lordship on board
his ship, then lying off the town of Nor∣folk
in Virginia; and on his return he
took charge of such letters as were arrived
in the fleet, addressed to persons in this
province, amongst them was a packet for
our governor from Lord George Germaine,
secretary of state for the American depart∣ment.</P>
<P>In his passage up the bay, he was board∣ed
by an armed vessel in the provincial ser∣vice,
the commander of which examined
his papers, and after taking from him the
official dispatches, permitted him to pro∣ceed
to Annapolis, with such letters as
were totally unconnected with political
transactions. On the 6th of April he ar∣rived
in this city, by which opportunity I
had the happiness to receive your epistle
of the sixteenth of November last.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="328"/>
Lord George Germaine's letter acknow∣ledged
the important information which ad∣ministration
had received from our governor,
who was assured “of his Majesty's entire
approbation of his conduct; and was di∣rected
to proceed in the line of his duty
with all possible address and activity.”</P>
<P>This packet was forwarded to General
Lee, who has the command of the south∣ern
district, by whom it was immediately
dispatched to Maryland, with a strong re∣commendation
to seize the person of the
governor, together with all papers and do∣cuments
of office; by which it was pre∣sumed
some important discoveries would
be made of ministerial intentions.</P>
<P>The council of safety acted on this cri∣tical
occasion with the utmost moderation
and delicacy. Governor Eden, by the af∣fability
of his manners, and his evident
disposition to promote the interests of the
<PB N="281" REF="329"/>
province, had conciliated universal regard.
They, therefore, avoided proceeding with
that precipitate vigour so strenuously en∣joined;
and only required him to give his
parole, that he would not take any mea∣sures
for leaving the continent, till after
the meeting of the next convention.</P>
<P>This requisition the governor, for some
time, warmly resisted; but, on convic∣tion
that the measure was unavoidable, he
thought it necessary to comply, therefore,
on the sixteenth of the month, gave every
satisfactory assurance.</P>
<P>On the seventh instant the convention
assembled, and yesterday they came to a
determination respecting my worthy pa∣tron;
when it was resolved, “that his
longer continuance in the province, at
so critical a period, might be preju∣dicial
to the cause in which the colonies
were unanimously engaged; and that,
<PB N="282" REF="330"/>
therefore, his immediate departure for
England was absolutely necessary.” An
address was accordingly directed to be
drawn up, and presented to his excellency,
which was delivered to him this evening
by a committee of that body.</P>
<P>In this address the sentiments of the
convention are expressed in liberal terms;
“they acknowledge the services rendered
by the governor to the country, on many
former occasions; and they express the
warmest wishes, that when the unhap∣py
disputes which, at present prevail,
are constitutionally accommodated, he
may speedily return and re-assume the
reins of government.”</P>
<P>I cannot yet form any conclusion how
I am to regulate my conduct on this im∣portant
occasion. The governor is of opi∣nion
that it is my indispensible duty to re∣main
in Maryland, while the ancient form
<PB N="283" REF="331"/>
of government is, in any degree, acknow∣ledged
and continued. But how long that
will be, is a matter of great uncertainty.</P>
<P>It is but justice to confess, that the
most respectable leading men in this pro∣vince,
have acted with as much temper
and propriety, as the nature of the times
would admit. Yet I am apprehensive,
however favourably they may be now dis∣posed,
they will not long be able to stem
the torrent which, in several provinces,
runs strongly towards independence. What∣ever
may be the complexion of my fate, I
will continue to act consistently with, what
I conceive, to be my duty; and should
necessity compel me to revisit my native
clime, I shall assuredly be supported by a
consciousness, that my misfortunes are de∣rived
from inevitable events, and not from
impropriety of conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="332"/>
Our friends must not expect from my
pen, any comments on the present opera∣tions:
I am determined to avoid discus∣sions
which cannot possibly answer any sa∣lutary
purpose; nor will I censure any in∣dividual,
or collective body, merely from
being actuated by sentiments different from
my own. Human nature, even in the full
possession of every human acquirement,
cannot possibly be exempt from error: and
the best intended actions are, sometimes,
liable to censure. I therefore trust it will
be ever my disposition to judge in the most
favourable manner of my fellow-creatures,
and acknowledge every man to be right,
whose conduct is directed by the conscien∣tious
dictates of his breast.</P>
<P>Saturday, <DATE>June 1.</DATE></P>
<P>Our friend S—embarked last Sunday
for Virginia, to learn whether there were
<PB N="285" REF="333"/>
any vessels, on that station, bound for Eng∣land;
and yesterday he returned from his
expedition. A ship of war, under a flag
of truce, will shortly be ordered hither to
convey the governor down the bay; who
is now fully engaged in making prepara∣tions
for his departure. I am, however,
of opinion, he will not immediately pro∣ceed
for Europe; but that he will be anx∣ious
to remain near the scene of action,
until a competent judgment can be form∣ed,
whether any reconciliation is likely to
be effected; an event which a few weeks
will probably determine.</P>
<P>Mr. S—, myself, and my colleague,
are to continue for the present in our re∣spective
stations. The first named is charg∣ed
with the settlement of the governor's
private concerns; and as the loan office is
of the utmost provincial importance, it is
absolutely necessary that the commissioners
<PB N="286" REF="334"/>
should continue to act in that department,
as long as a shadow remains of the ancient
constitution. Should those who have now
the ascendency, think it expedient to model
a new system, under which I cannot con∣scientiously
remain, I shall avail myself of
the first opportunity to take leave of this
continent.</P>
<P>In consequence of residing with the
governor, I expected an exemption from
any penalties inflicted on persons, who
had refused to associate or enrol. But in
this idea I was very materially mistaken.
The committee of observation will not
consider me as a member of his excellency's
household; alledging in support of their
opinion, that I hold offices immediately
dependent on the province. These are
not times to dispute nice points. I have
therefore paid ten pounds for my fine, and
have taken a receipt for the same. My
<PB N="287" REF="335"/>
arms have likewise been demanded. I am,
however, happy to inform you, that I
have constantly been treated with kind
attention, even by political opponents. It
is my endeavour to regulate my conduct
with propriety; carefully avoiding mixed
company; taking heed that “I offend not
with my tongue;” and not permitting my
pen to expatiate on the tendency of public
transactions. I intrust this to the care of
a friend, bound to Lisbon; may it safely
reach you!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 4th, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>EVERY day is pregnant with some
new event. I am apprehensive from
a recent circumstance, that I must quickly
<PB N="288" REF="336"/>
bid adieu to Maryland. The committee
of observation have, this morning, served
me with a summons to attend them on
Thursday next, “to give security for my
behaviour during the present unhappy
contention with Great Britain.” I
must either comply; submit to imprison∣ment;
or abandon the country. The first
I consider as incompatible with my oath of
allegiance: confinement is an evil I would
most willingly avoid; and a voyage to Eu∣rope
will, inevitatably, subject me to all
the complicated embarrassments attending
disappointment, and a contracted income:
but at all events, I will rely on Providence,
and persevere in my integrity.</P>
<P>When I appear before the Committee, I
propose to intimate my intention of return∣ing
home; and shall only entreat a rea∣sonable
time to adjust my public and pri∣vate
concerns; that I may be enabled to
<PB N="289" REF="337"/>
leave the province with unsullied reputa∣tion.
I hope the Governor will not sail
before my fate is determined.</P>
<P>Friday, <DATE>7th June.</DATE></P>
<P>I learn that many of our friends, who
are supposed to be inimical to the popular
cause, are also summoned by the Com∣mittee
of Observation, so that such conso∣lation
as can be derived from having associ∣ates
in difficulty will at least be afforded me.
The concerns of the Loan Office, are of the
utmost importance to the public; and some
time will be absolutely requisite, to adjust
them with propriety. The ruling powers
will therefore, surely, be convinced of the
necessity of this measure; and comply with
a requisition founded on reason, and pro∣priety.
In that case, a possibility appears,
that an accommodation may be effected
<PB N="290" REF="338"/>
before the expiration of the term, which
may be allotted for the settlement of that
department; and we shall, consequently,
be reinstated with every circumstance of
advantage and reputation.</P>
<P>Sunday, <DATE>9th June.</DATE></P>
<P>We are in hourly expectation of seeing
the ship which is to convey the Governor
from this province; and though I am so∣licitous
to transmit the result of Tuesday's
proceedings, yet, on his own account, I
am anxious for his immediate departure,
lest any alteration should take place, which
may occasion his detention in Maryland.</P>
<P>In my last letter, I mentioned that it
was most earnestly recommended by Gene∣ral
Lee, to seize the person of the Gover∣nor,
together with his papers and official
documents. The Congress have, also, in
strong terms, urged the expediency of
<PB N="291" REF="339"/>
that measure; and the Convention of Vir∣ginia,
have likewise come to a similar reso∣lution;
which they have published to the
world; and which they are endeavouring
to enforce with all their power.</P>
<P>The sentiments expressed in the resolve
of that province, sufficiently evince the
danger of delay, as they already appear to
operate, with great force, on the minds of
the multitude; and there are some who
publicly avow their opinion, that the com∣munity
at large, are not bound to yield
their assent to any proceedings of delegates,
which, in their consequences, may be pre∣judicial
to the general interests of America.</P>
<P>That you may be enabled to form a
clear idea, under what embarrassing cir∣cumstances
the Governor is at present situ∣ated,
I have transcribed the resolve for
your more particular information.</P>

<P>“Resolved, <HI>unanimously,</HI> That the Com∣mittee
of Safety be directed to write a let∣ter
to the President of the Convention of
Maryland, in answer to his letter of the
twenty-fifth instant, expressing the deepest
concern at the proceedings of that Con∣vention,
respecting Governor Eden; and
our reasons for not becoming accessary
thereto, by giving him a passport through
this colony, or the bay adjoining: that
we would with reluctance, in any case, in∣termeddle
in the affairs of a sister colony,
but in this matter we are much interested;
and the Convention of Maryland, by send∣ing
their proceedings to the Committee of
Safety, have made it the duty of the Con∣vention,
to declare their sentiments thereon.</P>
<P>“That considering the intercepted let∣ter
from Lord George Germaine to Go∣vernor
<PB N="293" REF="341"/>
Eden,” in which his whole conduct,
and confidential letters are approved; and
he is directed to give facility and assistance
to the operations of Lord Dunmore, against
Virginia, we are at a loss to account for
the Council of Safety of Maryland, their
having neglected to seize him, according to
the recommendation of the general Con∣gress;
and more so for the Convention
having promoted his passage, to assist in our
destruction, under a pretence of his retir∣ing
to England, which we conceive, from
the above letter, he is not at liberty to do;
that supposing he should go to Britain, it
appears to us, that such voyage, with the
address presented to him, will enable him to
assume the character of a public agent, and
by promoting division amongst the colonies,
produce consequences the most fatal to the
American cause: that as the reasons assigned
for his departure, “That he must obey
the ministerial mandates while remain∣ing
<PB N="294" REF="342"/>
in his government,” are very unsatis∣factory,
when the Convention declare, that
“in his absence, the government, in its
old form, will devolve on the President
of the Council of State;” who will be
under equal obligation to obey such man∣dates.
We cannot avoid imputing these
proceedings to some undue influence of
Governor Eden, under the mask of friend∣ship
to America; and of the proprietary
interest in Maryland, whereby the members
of that Convention were betrayed into a
vote of fatal tendency to the common cause,
and, we fear, to this country in particular;
and feel it an indispensible duty, to warn
the good people of that province against
the proprietary influence.</P>

From the above it appears evident, that
my observations, respecting the temper and
moderation of those who, at present, direct
the political concernments of this province,
are well-founded. Independence is by no
means the general wish in Maryland. Our
neighbours are, however, active in propa∣gating
the popular doctrines, and I fear
the number of proselytes is daily augment∣ing.
The above appeal of the colony of
Virginia, has already added fuel to the fire;
it has increased the zeal of the vio∣lent;
and may possibly lead to measures,
which those who are now at the helm,
have not yet thought it expedient to
adopt.</P>
<P>Monday, <DATE>10th June.</DATE></P>
<P>To-morrow I must obey the summons

have drawn up the following representa∣tion

<LETTER>
<OPENER>“To the chairman and members of the

“GENTLEMEN,”</OPENER>
<P>“We flatter ourselves that the follow∣ing
representation will engage the Com∣mittee's
candid,” and dispassionate considera∣tion;
and that when the personal liberty of
even an individual is concerned, his endea∣vours
to preserve it will be received with
indulgence.</P>
<P>“You will please,” gentlemen, to ob∣serve,
that it is not ordered by the Con∣vention,
that the Committees of Observa∣tion
take bonds of all non-associators, but
it is left to their discretion, whether to re∣quire
bonds or not; and in the exercise of
<PB N="297" REF="345"/>
this power, though the committees are not
held, as magistrates are in similar cases, by
the obligation of an oath, yet we presume
they are bound in honour, not to demand
security unnecessary for the public good,
and inconvenient and embarrassing to the
persons called upon.</P>
<P>“From the above consideration we in∣ferred,”
on being required to give up our
arms, without any demand or hint respect∣ing
the entering into bonds, that the Com∣mittee
of Observation, in their discretion,
did not deem it necessary, or conducive to
the public good. Had we been called
upon for that purpose, we should have had
an opportunity of appealing immediately
to the Convention. To that respectable
body, we could have represented our pecu∣liar
circumstances; that we are officers of
the Crown; that we have given security
in London for the faithful discharge of our
<PB N="298" REF="346"/>
duty, agreeable to instructions from time
to time received, respecting the revenue of
customs; that we are not entitled to our
salaries without a nihil account, transmit∣ted
quarterly of our proceedings; and, that
though a correspondence of this nature
could be no way injurious to America, yet
it might, perhaps, be deemed a breach of
the proposed bond, and consequently de∣prive
us of the means of subsistence for
ourselves and families; for by the condi∣tion
of this bond, “no correspondence,
directly or indirectly, by letter, message,
or otherwise, with any person holding a
civil office under the crown, is allowa∣ble,”
even a demand for, and receipt of
our salaries, would be a breach of the con∣dition
prescribed.</P>
<P>“Although we are not natives of this
country,” we are animated with the warmest
attachment for its interest and happiness;
<PB N="299" REF="347"/>
and we flatter ourselves, that our conduct,
for a term of years, has been generally ap∣proved,
both as servants of the public, and
members of the community. We are de∣termined
to persevere, faithfully and ho∣nourably,
in discharging the duties of our
respective offices, as long as with propriety
we can act in the same; but we cannot
sacrifice our honour, or prostitute our oaths,
for temporary indulgences. Should we be
obliged to depart from this continent, we
hope we shall be permitted to take leave,
with security to our persons and property,
agreeably to a resolve of the Convention,
in that case provided; and wherever we
may fix our residence, we shall retain the
most affectionate regard for Maryland,
without deviating from our allegiance to
our Sovereign, which has been, and will
ever continue to be the invariable rule of
our conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="348"/>
“Not to trespass,” gentlemen, upon your
time, permit us to assure you, that we can∣not,

enter into the proposed bond. We act
solely from principle, and the dictates of
conscience. Relying, therefore, on your
impartiality, we shall cheerfully submit to
whatever you may please to determine;
and however Providence may dispose of us
in future, our prayers shall be continually
offered for the prosperity of this once
happy province, most ardently wishing a
permanent and constitutional reconciliation
may speedily take place, and that Great
Britain and America may remain, to the

Convention, and grant us passes to depart
the country, we have only to desire that a
sufficient time may be allotted us, to settle
the various and intricate concerns of the
loan-office, which we need not observe,
are of the utmost importance to the com∣munity
in general. It is also highly in∣cumbent
on us, to leave the business of
that department in a clear state, so that our
securities, who are engaged in very large
sums for our fidelity, may be honourably
discharged from the obligations entered
into on our behalf.”</P>
<P>We are by no means sanguine, with re∣gard
to the above application; on the con∣trary,
we are prepared to encounter every
disagreeable consequence. It is possible a
few weeks may be allotted, to adjust pro∣vincial
and private concerns: we must
<PB N="302" REF="350"/>
then give up every flattering expectation;
every late erected hope. We must forsake
ALL, or act inconsistently with the dictates
of honour and of conscience.</P>
<P>The case of my respectable colleague, is
uncommonly severe. Mrs. C—is on
the point of adding to a family, already
numerous, and totally dependent on his
industry for support. In times like these,
it is impossible to dispose of any property,
in order to raise a sufficiency for their tem∣porary
use in England; notwithstanding
which, he is determined to encounter the
utmost malevolence of fortune; every ac∣cumulated
evil, which penury can inflict,
rather than deviate from his principles, or
violate his allegiance.</P>
<P>Tuesday evening, <DATE>11th June.</DATE></P>
<P>We have attended the Committee, and
have heard their decision. On our refus∣ing
to enter into bond, with good and suf∣ficient
<PB N="303" REF="351"/>
security, under the penalty of ten
thousand pounds each, we are directed to
leave the province before the first of Au∣gust.
I shall be as expeditious as possible
in adjusting my concerns, and shall pro∣bably,
be with you before the conclusion
of September.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Convention broke
up so lately, they are summoned to meet
again in a few days, on account of some
important dispatches received from Con∣gress.
The Virginians are exceedingly
irritated with our ruling powers, for per∣mitting
the Governor to leave the country;
and are taking vigorous measures, which
they trust will have an effect in this pro∣vince,
to his prejudice. All who wish him
well, are anxious to behold the ship that is
to convey him hence, as apprehensions are
justly entertained of some violent measures
to detain him.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="352"/>
A formidable association has taken place
in the town of Baltimore, under the appel∣lation
of the Whig Club; they loudly
proclaim the absolute necessity of seizing
and securing the person of the Governor,
as a pledge for the public safety; and it is
asserted, that a plan is actually in agitation
to accomplish this purpose, in defiance of
that legislature which themselves have esta∣blished.
Under such a combination of per∣plexing
circumstances, his Excellency con∣ducts
himself with the utmost coolness and
fortitude: he does not appear to entertain
the most remote suspicion, but to rely
confidently on the honour of the Conven∣tion,
which is solemnly pledged for his safe
departure.</P>
<P>I mean to entrust this letter to the care
of my patron, and therefore cannot en∣tertain
any apprehension that it will be
liable to inspection; and shall, in conse∣quence,
<PB N="305" REF="353"/>
venture to make some comments
on the late proceedings of the Committee
of Observation.</P>
<P>I believe the demand of such unreasonable
security is unprecedented: it is, therefore,
evident, that the intention of that body, is
to banish all who are deemed inimical to
the popular cause. The case of the Crown
officers is particularly distressing, as it is
well known that they are required, under
the most sacred obligations, to give imme∣diate
circumstantial information of any de∣signs
that may be concerted against the
peace, or order of government. Who,
therefore, in possession of the least share of
reason, would consent to hazard so great a
penalty, on behalf of men, who must un∣doubtedly
be guilty of perjury, should they
neglect an opportunity to convey intelli∣gence.
Some of our friends, under simi∣lar
circumstances, entertain an opinion,
<PB N="306" REF="354"/>
that when the Convention meet, they will
check the authority of the respective com∣mittees,
and afford some indulgence to
those who have been unnecessarily oppressed
by their power. For my part, I very lit∣tle
rely on such delusive expectations. The
utmost moderation and temper, consider∣ing
the complexion of the times, has, in∣deed,
hitherto marked the proceedings of
that body; but violent and inflammatory
men, are now industriously straining every
nerve, to excite general confusion, and
plunge us fatally deep in schemes of inde∣pendance.
From this powerful considera∣tion,
I am decidedly of opinion that the Con∣vention
will not hazard their influence, or
their popularity, by injudiciously attempt∣ing
to extend any indulgence to a descrip∣tion
of men, who are too generally pro∣scribed
as enemies to the freedom, and the
interests of America.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="355"/>
The instant the governor embarks, I
shall establish my temporary residence with
my worthy colleague and his family, and
with them shall probably bid adieu to Ma∣ryland,
and to a valuable circle of respec∣table
connexions.</P>
<P>Sunday, <DATE>June 16.</DATE></P>
<P>Not any intelligence is yet received of the
expected ship. The governor appears ra∣ther
anxious for her arrival, and his friends
are solicitous for his immediate departure,
as there are busy spirits at work, who la∣bour
to excite commotions with a view to
his detention.</P>
<P>It seems to be the general opinion, that
the colonies will speedily be declared FREE
and INDEPENDENT STATES!—In that
case what dreadful calamities must inevit∣ably
ensue!—But surely every weighty
reason should operate for postponing this
<PB N="308" REF="356"/>
most important measure, until the com∣missioners
have made known the extent of
their powers, and the terms they are au∣thorized
to propose. Should the colonies
be thus precipitate, Great Britain cannot
tamely admit the claim, and the sword
alone must determine the fatal contest.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, I look forward with
extreme impatience to the hour of my de∣parture
from this country, where every
surrounding prospect is dreary and uncom∣fortable.
It is probable I shall be obliged
to go by the way of Nova Scotia. From
Hallifax, the capital of that province, I
shall find frequent opportunities of a pas∣sage
to England; but from this place
so few, that, after I am ready for em∣barkation,
I may be detained many weeks
before I can be accommodated. But to
accomplish my purpose, I must obtain
permission to join the British fleet on the
<PB N="309" REF="357"/>
Virginia station, from which vessels are
frequently dispatched to the general ren∣dezvous.</P>
<P>It is possible that this course may prove
advantageous to our private concerns; and
I am confident our worthy friend the com∣missary-general,
will exert his utmost en∣deavours
to render my situation agreeable,
while I am necessarily detained in that part
of America. By the first ship after the
receipt of this, I request you to inform
him that, “as it is probable I shall visit
his station previous to my return to Eu∣rope,
I entreat him to take charge of
all letters that may be forwarded to his
care.” He will gratify his own incli∣nation
in rendering us every good office;
and on my interview with him, I may pos∣sibly
obtain such information as may enable
me to regulate my concerns, with a pro∣per
attention to our mutual interest.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="358"/>
The convention are to meet on Wednes∣day,
and it is probable, before they rise,
that some important measures will be de∣termined
on by Congress, in which they
will be expected to acquiesce. Indepen∣dence
is the general cry of the infatuated
multitude: What effects may flow from
a proceeding of this nature, are dreadful to
imagine. Most fervently do I wish the
governor safe on board; for though the
convention, at their former session, pledg∣ed
their honour for his peaceable depar∣ture,
they may, from an idea of absolute
necessity, think themselves justified in re∣scinding
that resolution. The times are
so dangerous and unsettled, that it is im∣possible
to draw conclusions from present
appearances. Every countenance is cloud∣ed
with suspicion, and the warmest attach∣ments
are obliterated by the malignant in∣fluence
of political contention. The go∣vernor,
apparently, continues easy and col∣lected:
<PB N="311" REF="359"/>
he is treated with every exterior
mark of attention; and I am persuaded,
the consistency and propriety of his con∣duct,
in many trying and peculiar situ∣ations,
will be long remembered with sen∣timents
of esteem and gratitude.</P>
<P>Sunday, <DATE>June 23.</DATE></P>
<P>Last night the Fowey frigate, command∣ed
by Captain George Montague, arrived
off this harbour; and early this morning
the first lieutenant came on shore with a
flag of truce. The governor will embark
in the course of the day. Would he were
gone! It is impossible to determine what
a minute may produce. The militia are
under arms, and a general confusion pre∣vails.
You can well conceive the sensa∣tions
I experience on this very affecting
occasion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 29, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>MY last, by the governor, will, I
trust, safely reach you; but when an
opportunity may again offer to transmit in∣telligence
of my situation, is indeed a most
painful uncertainty. I shall, neverthe∣less,
occasionally resume the pen, as cir∣cumstances
may arise; and, as it is my
intent carefully to avoid commenting on po∣litical
transactions, I hope not to encoun∣ter
any hazard in the course of our future
correspondence.</P>
<P>Till the moment of the governor's em∣barkation
on the 23d, there was every
reason to apprehend a change of disposition
to his prejudice. Some few were even cla∣morous
for his detention. But the coun∣cil
of safety, who acted under a resolve of
<PB N="313" REF="361"/>
the convention, generously ratified the en∣gagements
of that body; and after they
had taken an affectionate leave of their late
supreme magistrate, he was conducted to
the barge with every mark of respect due
to the elevated station he had so worthily
filled.</P>
<P>A few minutes before his departure, I
received his strict injunctions to be steady
and cautious in the regulation of my con∣duct;
and not to abandon my situation, on
any consideration, until absolutely dis∣charged
by an authority which might, too
probably, be erected on the ruins of the
ancient constitution. I promised the most
implicit attention to his salutary advice;
and rendered my grateful acknowledgments
for the innumerable obligations he had
conferred on me; at the same time I of∣fered
my most fervent wishes, that his
future happiness might be in full propor∣tion
<PB N="314" REF="362"/>
to the integrity of his conduct, and
the benevolence of his mind.</P>
<P>In about an hour the barge reached the
Fowey, and the governor was received on
board under a discharge of cannon: his
baggage and provisions were left on shore,
to be forwarded in the course of the en∣suing
day.</P>
<P>During the night, some servants, and
a soldier, belonging to the Maryland regi∣ment,
found means to escape on board his
Majesty's ship, which being almost imme∣diately
discovered, a flag was sent off, with
a message, to captain Montague, demand∣ing
the restitution of the men, previous to
any further communication.</P>
<P>Captain Montague, in reply, acquainted
the council of safety, “that he could not,
consistently with his duty, deliver up any
persons who, as subjects of his Britannic
<PB N="315" REF="363"/>
Majesty, had fled to him for refuge and
protection; that he had strictly given it in
charge to such officers as might be sent
on shore, not to bring off any of the in∣habitants
without the express permission
of the ruling powers; but that the case
was extremely different respecting those
who had, even at the hazard of life, given
evidence of their attachment to the an∣cient
constitution.”</P>
<P>This message not being deemed satisfac∣tory,
a letter was dispatched to the gover∣nor,
demanding his interference in this cri∣tical
business, with an intimation, that the
detention of the men would be considered
as a manifest breach of the regulations
under which flags of truce are established.</P>
<P>Governor Eden received the officer with
proper attention, but replied, he had only
to observe, that on board his Majesty's ship,
he had not the least authority; and that
<PB N="316" REF="364"/>
Captain Montague was not to be influenced
by his opinion, as he acted on principles
which he conceived to be strictly consistent
with the line of his duty.</P>
<P>The event of this negotiation was dis∣agreeable
in its consequences to the gover∣nor.
The populace were exceedingly irri∣tated,
and it was thought expedient not
only to prohibit all further intercourse with
the Fowey, but also to detain the various
stores which the governor had provided for
his voyage to Europe. This resolution
was intimated in express terms; and, on
the evening of the 24th, Captain Mon∣tague
weighed anchor, and stood down
the bay, for his station on the coast of
Virginia.</P>
<P>This incident, inconsiderable as it may ap∣pear,
will operate strongly against those who
have hitherto restrained the impetuosity of
the popular zeal. The delegates in congress,
<PB N="317" REF="365"/>
for this province, have been instructed to
oppose the declaration of independence;
but it now appears almost a general opi∣nion,
that Maryland will coincide in every
measure which the uniting colonies may
think essential for the interest and happi∣ness
of the general community.</P>
<P><DATE>July 2.</DATE></P>
<P>The 31st of the present month was the
extent of time limited for our continuance
in Maryland, by the committee of obser∣vation,
in consequence of our refusal to
enter into the proposed bond. Conscious
that it was impossible to settle the concerns
of the loan office with satisfaction to the
public, to our securities, and to ourselves,
within the term they had thought proper
to prescribe, Mr. C—and myself de∣termined
to address the convention imme∣diately
on their meeting, for such relief as,
<PB N="318" REF="366"/>
on principles of justice and equity, we
were entitled to demand.</P>
<P>We, accordingly, in firm, but respect∣ful
terms, represented our peculiar cir∣cumstances,
referring them to the me∣morial
which had been presented by us to
the committee of observation. On due
consideration it was agreed by both houses,
“to depute some members of their body
to investigate the accounts and transac∣tions
of the commissioners of the loan of∣fice,
to discharge them from that impor∣tant
trust, and to appoint others to suc∣ceed
them therein.”</P>
<P>In consequence of this determination,
a considerable period may possibly elapse,
before this business will be finally adjusted,
till which time we shall be permitted to re∣main
quietly in the country without any
further requisition to enter into engage∣ments.
This undoubtedly is a great point
<PB N="319" REF="367"/>
gained in our favour, procrastination being,
with us, an object of the utmost impor∣tance.
A short time may be productive
of events conducive to public and private
tranquillity. “Hope springs eternal.”
But were a judgment to be formed from
the present aspect of political concerns,
every peaceful expectation must be aban∣doned.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>July 8th.</DATE></P>
<P>At length the decisive blow is struck.
The colonies, by their delegates in con∣gress,
are declared FREE AND INDEPEN∣DENT
STATES, which great event took
place on the fourth instant! By this act
they have abjured all allegiance to the Bri∣tish
crown; and have renounced every po∣litical
connexion with the land from which
they derive their origin. The declaration
will soon reach England, and will be found
to contain a long catalogue of grievances.
<PB N="320" REF="368"/>
This composition, which is replete with
invective, is not more temperate than the
measures which it professes to defend.
What effect it will have on the councils
and operations of government, a short time
will possibly determine.</P>
<P>I cannot but contemplate, with horror,
the complicated miseries which appear
ready to overwhelm this devoted country.
Thousands who, at this instant, are flushed
with hope, and exulting in a total separa∣tion
from the interests of the parent state,
will, probably, before many months elapse,
execrate the precipitation by which they
have been hurried into measures fatally pre∣judicial
to their repose and happiness.</P>
<P>Before you receive this, the particulars
of the action off Charles Town, in South
Carolina, on the 28th of June, will be in the
possession of government. Our accounts say,
the British troops were totally defeated with
a prodigious loss, after many exertions per∣fectly
<PB N="321" REF="369"/>
characteristic of the national bravery.
It is reported, that the quarter deck of
the Bristol was, at one time, cleared of
every person but the intrepid Sir Peter
Parker, who stood alone, a spectacle of he∣roic
firmness never exceeded in military
history. Three of the English frigates,
by accident, or through the ignorance of
their pilot, were entangled in some shoals,
where, for a long time, they appeared to
be immoveably fixed. With great damage
and difficulty, two were, at length, got
off; but not in a condition to render
any effectual service. The Actaeon, of
twenty-eight guns, was burnt by her of∣ficers
and crew, on the following morn∣ing,
to prevent her falling into the hands
of the provincials, every effort having prov∣ed
ineffectual to remove her from her situ∣ation.
This decisive victory, as it is here
termed, has given great spirits to the ad∣vocates
for the new government, and will
<PB N="322" REF="370"/>
tend to confirm them in their hostile dis∣position.</P>
<P>I trust this to a circuitous passage. It
will be forwarded by the French islands.
Entertain not the most distant apprehen∣sion
with respect to my safety; I am treat∣ed
with liberality and attention. When
shall I again acknowledge a letter from
you? To remain thus ignorant of the situ∣ation
of my family, is a weighty addition
to the complicated evils I encounter. We
must submit with fortitude!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Aug 1, 1776.</DATE></P>
<P>ON the 14th ult. Lord Howe safely
arrived at Staten Island, after hav∣ing
been long expected, by many persons,
with the most anxious impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="371"/>
His lordship immediately dispatched on
shore, by a flag, a circular letter to the go∣vernors
of the colonies, acquainting them
with the powers with which he was in∣vested;
and desiring that they would pub∣lish,
as generally as possible, an enclosed
declaration of the British legislature.</P>
<P>In this declaration the public are ac∣quainted
with the powers himself, and his
brother the general, are invested with, under
the late act of parliament, by which they are
authorized “To grant general or particular
pardons to those who, in the tumult of
the times, might have deviated from
their just allegiance; and who were
willing, by a speedy return to their duty,
to reap the benefits of the royal fa∣vour.”
“The commissioners have like∣wise
the power of declaring any colony,
town, or district, to be at his Majesty's
peace; in which case the penal provisions
<PB N="324" REF="372"/>
of that law would cease in their favour.
A due consideration is likewise promised
to the services of all persons who may
contribute to the restoration of the pub∣lic
tranquillity.”</P>
<P>The above papers having been immedi∣ately
forwarded by General Washington to
congress, were, as speedily published, by
their directions, in all the prints through∣out
the united colonies, accompanied with
the following resolution.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>“IN CONGRESS.”</HEAD>
<P><DATE>July 19.</DATE></P>
<P>“RESOLVED,” that a copy of the cir∣cular
letters, and of the declaration they

sent to Amboy by a flag, and forwarded to

either in the justice, or moderation of their
late king, may now, at length, be con∣vinced,
that the valour alone of their coun∣try
is to save its liberties.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>CHA. THOMPSON, Sec.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus are the sanguine expectations of
multitudes cruelly frustrated; it being es∣teemed
criminal, by the ruling powers, to
assert the pacific inclinations of the Bri∣tish
ministry. On the contrary, it is loudly
maintained, that unconditional submission is
the only ground on which the commissi∣oners
are empowered to treat: and there∣fore
<PB N="326" REF="374"/>
to commence any negotiation on such
a basis, would be inconsistent with good
sense, sound policy, and the essential in∣terests
of America. “All hope excluded
thus,” we must prepare for consequences
of the most serious nature; not the most
distant probability appearing of a friendly
accommodation.</P>
<P><DATE>August 9.</DATE></P>
<P>Advice is received that Lord Dunmore,
with his fleet, has quitted the coast of
Virginia; and is supposed to be gone to
the southward. By every account, the
hardships experienced by the loyalists, and
by all who were on board those ships, have
been dreadful in the extreme. The in∣tense
heat of the weather, the badness and
scarcity of water and provisions, together
with the closeness of the small vessels in
which the wretched fugitives were crowd∣ed,
produced a malignant fever, which
<PB N="327" REF="375"/>
made great havock, but more particularly
affected the negroes, most of whom were
carried off by the violence of the disorder.
Thus are the hopes terminated with re∣spect
to the emancipation of slaves, in
order to suppress the commotions in the
southern colonies.</P>
<P>Thursday, <DATE>5th September.</DATE></P>
<P>Intelligence of a most alarming nature
has been transmitted from New York. On
the twenty-second ultimo, the British forces
landed without opposition, near Utrecht
and Gravesend, on the south-west end of
Long Island; and on the twenty-seventh,
a desperate action ensued, which has
proved fatal to the arms of America. Par∣ticulars
of the loss in killed, wounded,
and prisoners, are not yet ascertained.
Maryland has suffered most severely
in this conflict; many young men of
the most respectable families, being in∣cluded
<PB N="328" REF="376"/>
in the number of the slain. Ge∣neral
Washington has effected a masterly
retreat, with the residue of the provin∣cial
army, to New York, which is re∣presented
as invulnerable. This defeat
does not yet appear to be attended with
such consequences as might naturally be
expected: the colonists seem to depend
on their internal resources, and defy the
utmost exertions of a brave and con∣quering
enemy. There are, however,
moderate men, and some of considerable
influence, who are inclined to think that
the late event may induce the leaders in
Congress to commence an immediate nego∣tiation
with the parliamentary commis∣sioners.
Whatever may tend to the re∣storation
of peace, cannot but afford the
highest gratification to every humane, be∣nevolent
mind.</P>

<P>In consequence of a message sent by
Lord Howe to Congress, three gentlemen
were deputed to confer with him and the
general, in order to learn the extent of
their authority, and to hear such propo∣sitions
as they were enabled to make.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and Mr.
Rutledge, were the committee appointed
on this very interesting occasion; and the
report they have made to Congress on the
subject of their conference has totally de∣stroyed
every pleasing idea of a pacific
treaty.</P>
<P>The following are the words in which
the Committee have thought proper to
sum up the particulars of their late nego∣tiation;
and I shall only add on the sub∣ject,
that reasons are from this deduced,
<PB N="330" REF="378"/>
to prosecute the war with the utmost vi∣gour,
against the power and authority of
the mother country.</P>
<P>“Upon the whole, it did not appear to
your Committee, that his Lordship's
commission contained any other autho∣rity
of importance, than what is con∣tained
in the act of Parliament, viz.
that of granting pardons, with such ex∣ceptions
as the commissioners shall think
proper to make; and of declaring Ame∣rica,
or any part of it, to be in the
King's peace upon submission: for as to
the power of inquiring into the state of
America, which his Lordship mentioned
to us, and of conferring and consulting
with any persons the commissioners
might think proper; and representing
the result of such conversations to the
ministry, who (provided the colonies
would subject themselves,) might, after
<PB N="331" REF="379"/>
all, or might not, at their pleasure,
make any alterations in the former in∣structions
to governors, or propose in
parliament any amendment of the acts
complained of, we apprehend any ex∣pectation
from the effect of such a power,
would have been too uncertain and pre∣carious
to be relied on by America, had
she still continued in her state of de∣pendence.”</P>

<P>The city of New York is in the posses∣sion

which may enable them to retrieve, with

transactions.</P>

<P>Though the declaration of independence
was made on the fourth of July last, the
form of government, with respect to Ma∣ryland
is, by no means finally adjusted;
and from the delay which has been evi∣dent
in the proceedings of our Convention,
and the committees subordinate to their
direction, I cannot but indulge the pleas∣ing
idea, in spite of hostile operations, that
the moderate and dispassionate, who are

most distant possibility remains of a recon∣ciliation

ample and proper discharge from an em∣ployment
of so much importance to the
community.</P>
<P>From the present political appearances,
I cannot but indulge an opinion, that our
legislative body will not proceed with ala∣crity
in the prosecution of this business.
A short—a very short time, will probably
determine how far the colonies are enabled
to support coercive measures against the
formidable exertions of the British nation;
and should the least prospect appear of re∣turning
peace, it would be impolitic and
fruitless to discharge officers who would im∣mediately
be reinstated with advantage, on
affairs reverting into the ancient channel.</P>
<P>My worthy colleague and his family are
preparing to remove from Annapolis to a
house belonging to Mr. D—, on
Hunting Ridge, about six miles distant
<PB N="334" REF="382"/>
from Baltimore, to which place I intend
to accompany them. We propose to at∣tend
alternately in this city, until discharged
from our employments, or confirmed
in them.</P>
<P>Hunting Ridge, <DATE>Nov. 1.</DATE></P>
<P>I write to you from one of the most de∣lightful
situations on the continent of Ame∣rica,
where I have obtained an occasional
retreat from the noise, the tumult, and the
miseries of the public world. From the
back piazza of our habitation, we com∣mand
a truly picturesque view into several
fertile counties; a distant prospect of the
eastern shore; the magnificent waters of
the Chesapeak, and the river Patapsco,
from the entrance at the Bodkin Point, to
its apparent termination at the town of
Baltimore. After this inadequate descrip∣tion,
I need not observe, that we reside on
a lofty eminence, where
<Q><PB N="335" REF="383"/>
<L>“—the air</L>
<L>Nimbly, and sweetly recommends itself</L>
<L>Unto our gentle senses.”</L></Q></P>
<P>As Mr. C—and myself are not yet
superceded in our office, we attend in ro∣tation,
every other week, in Annapolis, from
which this place is about thirty miles dis∣tant.
The contrast we experience on these
occasions, is hardly to be described; from the
churlish sounds of hostile preparation to the
calm enjoyments of peaceful retirement.
Though in the vicinity of a large and popu∣lous
town, agitated with uproar and confu∣sion,
and rumours of approaching calamities,
here, sheltered by surrounding woods, we
are entirely secluded “from the busy haunts
of men,” and are benevolently permitted
to enjoy our retirement without dread
of molestation. It is well known that we
have never attempted, by any injudicious
steps, to incur the resentment of those
who conceive they are warranted by justice
<PB N="336" REF="384"/>
and by duty, to take a contrary part; and
while we thus continue to regulate our
conduct, we shall surely experience atten∣tion,
with the most perfect security.</P>
<P>Hunting Ridge, <DATE>1st Decem.</DATE></P>
<P>The whole of York Island is in the
possession of his Majesty's forces. General
Howe has, for some time, been attempting
to force General Washington to a decisive
action, which he has, hitherto, avoided
with the penetration of a Fabius. Sir
William, finding every well-concerted effort
ineffectual to accomplish this purpose, has
directed his arms against the garrison left
for the defence of Fort Washington, a very
strong post, situated on a lofty eminence,
and to which the approaches were ex∣tremely
difficult.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of November, the
provincial commander was summoned to
<PB N="337" REF="385"/>
surrender, which he refused to do, in the
most peremptory terms, declaring he would
defend his station to the last extremity. A
general assault was, in consequence, deter∣mined
upon, which took place on the six∣teenth,
when the fort was carried, after a
spirited defence; and the garrison, con∣sisting
of near three thousand men, became
prisoners of war.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth, Lord Cornwallis,
with a strong detachment, passed the north
river, in order to attack Fort Lee, and to
make some impression in the Jerseys, in
which undertaking he was so successful,
that the garrison, consisting of about two
thousand men, had a very narrow escape,
by abandoning the post immediately before
his Lordship's arrival, leaving their artil∣lery,
stores, and tents behind them.</P>
<P>For the particulars of these important
transactions, I shall refer you to the ac∣counts
<PB N="338" REF="386"/>
transmitted home to administration;
and have only to offer my most fervent
prayers, that the rapid successes which
have hitherto attended the British arms,
may be productive of an honourable, and
permanent reconciliation, founded on such
principles as may secure to America the
inestimable blessings of liberty, with every
consequence attending an abundant popu∣lation,
and an extensive commerce.</P>
<P>I fear many of my letters will miscarry;
but I hazard every opportunity of writ∣ing.
I am persuaded you do the same,
though fortune has hitherto been adverse to
my wishes. Oppose, with all your power,
the intrusion of anxious thoughts, and be∣lieve
me unalterably yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>Jan. 1, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>SINCE the day our hearts and inte∣rests
were united, frequent occasions
have been afforded for the exercise of our
fortitude and resignation, and by the bles∣sing
of Heaven, we have, hitherto, been
safely conducted through every vicissitude.
Let us then take courage from past expe∣rience.
The year opens with the most
dreary prospects. The recent event of
Trenton, will add strength to the sinews
of war, and cruelly procrastinate the wished
return of peace.</P>
<P>The capture of Rhode Island, which
happened on the eighth of December;
and the surprising of General Lee, on the
thirteenth, by Colonel Harcourt, were cir∣circumstances
<PB N="340" REF="388"/>
which excited sanguine hopes
in the breasts of those who persevered in
their attachment to the ancient constitu∣tion;
and these hopes were encouraged by
a strong probability, that Philadelphia must
speedily follow the fortune of New York,
the Delaware being the only apparent ob∣stacle
that seemed likely to oppose the
progress of the royal arms.</P>
<P>The provincial forces, who were only
enlisted for a stipulated time, discouraged
by a succession of unfavourable events, were
so greatly reduced in their numbers, that
it is asserted, on the day preceding the af∣fair
at Trenton, the muster roll scarcely
exceeded three thousand men; and the
greater part of those were anxious for the
expiration of their term, that they might
return to their families, and their accus∣tomed
vocations. The Congress, from a
well-founded apprehension of danger, re∣treated
<PB N="341" REF="389"/>
with precipitation to Baltimore;
and many who had been most zealous in
promoting hostile measures, began to avow
sentiments of a conciliatory nature; in a
word, the general disposition of the colo∣nies
tended to a reconciliation, and even
the submission of some of the provinces
was daily expected.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this promising train,
when the American general planned, and
executed the late important enterprise.
Trifling as this manoeuvre might have
been considered, in the prosecution of a re∣gular
war, it has been, in this instance, at∣tended
with the most prejudicial and alarm∣ing
consequences to his Majesty's arms.
It has given spirits to those who shewed
the utmost despondency; it has recruited
the enfeebled ranks; and it has enabled
the enthusiastic leaders to magnify, in the
most exaggerated terms, the advantages
<PB N="342" REF="390"/>
that must inevitably arise from the success
of this brilliant exertion.</P>
<P>To many it has appeared extraordinary,
that the advanced post was occupied by
Hessian regiments, who might reasonably
be supposed less competent than Bri∣tish,
to determine on the authenticity
of intelligence, or the disposition of the
colonists, with respect to political attach∣ment.
But how far censure is well found∣ed,
it becomes not an individual to deter∣mine.
It ought rather to be concluded,
that those arrangements took place, which
on mature reflection, apparently, led to the
advancement of the general service.</P>
<P>The mode hitherto adopted by Congress,
in conducting their enlistments, has been
found so inadequate to every essential pur∣pose,
that they have concluded on adopt∣ing
a different one, which affords the pro∣bability
of a permanent army, under the
<PB N="343" REF="391"/>
most strict and regular military discipline.
Hitherto their troops have been raised with
a condition of receiving their discharge at
the expiration of twelve months; and they
conceived, that this rotation of duty would
occasion the weight to fall less heavy on
the general community. But such a con∣tinual
succession of men, unexperienced,
and impatient of restraint, has rather im∣peded
than promoted the success of their
operations. It is therefore resolved, to
prosecute the new levies on a settled esta∣blishment.
Those who engage to enlist
during the continuance of the war, are to
have an immediate bounty of twenty dol∣lars;
and one hundred acres of land each,
at the expiration of their service. Officers
are to be rewarded in proportion to their
respective situations. Others are admitted
for the stipulated term of three years, who
are to receive the same bounty, without
any landed compensation. By this regula∣tion,
<PB N="344" REF="392"/>
it is supposed a very formidable army
will be ready to take the field early in the
ensuing spring, under a commander who
has inspired every adherent to the mea∣sures
of Congress, with the most unlimited
confidence in his superior abilities.</P>
<P>It is confidently asserted, and it appears
to be universally believed, that General
Washington will quickly be enabled to
repossess the Jerseys, and to contract the
British posts into a very limited sphere of
action. This is certain, that apprehen∣sions
respecting Philadelphia, are no longer
seriously entertained, Congress having it
in contemplation, speedily to resume their
deliberations in that city.</P>
<P>Myself and colleague, are not yet super∣ceded
in our provincial employment; but
the day is assuredly at hand. When that
event has taken place, I am persuaded I
shall be at liberty to revisit England; and
<PB N="345" REF="393"/>
have reason to believe, I shall be necessi∣tated
to shape my course by way of the
West Indies. I think it possible we may
be restored to each other early in the en∣suing
summer.</P>
<P>It has been a matter of surprise to many,
that the capes of Virginia have, in a great
measure, been left open, since the depar∣ture
of Lord Dunmore and his fleet from
the Chesapeak. In consequence of this
apparent remissness, on the part of the
British cruizers, a considerable commerce
is carried on, with very little interruption,
between Virginia and Maryland, and the
French and Dutch islands, and even with
several ports on the continent of Europe.
Those who continue attached to the inte∣rest
of Britain, behold, with infinite con∣cern,
many valuable prizes continually
brought into American harbours, by pri∣vateers
so inconsiderable in appearance, that
<PB N="346" REF="394"/>
they might readily be mistaken for boats
belonging to the vessels they were tri∣umphantly
conducting. Almost all the
ships which have hitherto been taken, had
not the least apprehension of danger,
consequently were not prepared for re∣sistance;
and if a certain judgment may
be formed from the success which has at∣tended
the adventurers from this, and the
adjacent colony, Great Britain must sensi∣bly
experience the loss she has already sus∣tained,
by the rapid and spirited exertions,
which have been so unexpectedly directed
against her commerce.</P>
<P>The exorbitant price of almost every
essential article, exceeds credibility. Those
few who are in possession of specie, do not
permit it to circulate; and the constant
depreciation of the paper currency, baffles
every attempt of the legislature to support
its credit; yet, in spite of every apparently
<PB N="347" REF="395"/>
insurmountable obstacle, the utmost ala∣crity
appears for the prosecution of the
war; and the most sanguine hopes are
evidently entertained, that the political
connexion between Great Britain and Ame∣rica,
is finally and effectually dissolved.</P>
<P>The internal government of Maryland,
is not yet perfectly adjusted, but the ar∣rangements,
under the new constitution,
are in great forwardness, and will speedily
take place in the various departments. Our
discharge will, undoubtedly, immediately
follow, and we shall be free to shape our
course as providence may direct.</P>
<P>When we again meet, I trust we shall
find friends, “though they grow not
thick on every bough,” who will pro∣mote
our endeavours to obtain a compe∣tent
maintenance. Under all the varied
circumstances of life, we will steadily la∣bour
to merit success; and should our best
<PB N="348" REF="396"/>
endeavours be frustrated, we shall, at
least, be exempt from self-accusation, and
can derive no little satisfaction, from a
consciousness that our sufferings are not
the bitter fruits of dissipation or miscon∣duct.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Frederick County, <DATE>March 1, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>CHANGE of scene is frequently con∣ducive
to a temporary tranquillity.
In order therefore to obtain, if possible,
some relief, some mitigation of my anxiety,
I set out, about twelve days since, on a
visiting excursion into this fertile and beau∣tiful
country; and am now beneath the
hospitable roof of Doctor John Stephen∣son,
in the vicinity of Frederick Town,
<PB N="349" REF="397"/>
where I have been entertained with that ge∣nuine
hospitality which so remarkably cha∣racterises
the <HI>American Romulus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On my return to the Ridge, I expect
some material information relative to my
particular situation; and have reason to
believe that I am, before this, reduced to
a private station, and that one journey to
Annapolis will settle my concerns as an of∣ficer
under the ancient constitution; after
which I shall, certainly, embrace the ear∣liest
opportunity of departing from the
wretched scene of confusion which this
country, at present, exhibits.</P>
<P>Hunting Ridge, <DATE>April 2.</DATE></P>
<P>We are, at length, superceded in our de∣partment
as commissioners of the Loan
Office; but it is probable some time will
elapse before we shall obtain our final dis∣charge,
as the accounts and transactions
<PB N="350" REF="398"/>
must undergo the investigation of a com∣mittee
of both houses. I shall be extreme∣ly
impatient for the conclusion of this bu∣siness;
after which I cannot entertain a
doubt of procuring an immediate passport
from America.</P>
<P>On the twenty-first of last month, a let∣ter
arrived from Sir Robert Eden, whose
integrity and services have procured him
an honourable distinction. A prelude, let
us hope, to more essential advantages.</P>
<P>On the same day which brought the
above pleasing intelligence, Mr. Thomas
Johnson was proclaimed governor of the
State of Maryland: the cannon from the
ramparts were discharged at the conclusion
of the ceremony; the military were under
arms, and the American standard was hoist∣ed
on the principal battery.</P>
<P>Every circumstance tends to convince
me, that I must quickly bid farewel to a
<PB N="351" REF="399"/>
country, where I have experienced many
benefits, and formed many valuable con∣nexions.
Could I obtain permission to
visit New York in my way to Europe, I
am certain I should there meet with letters
of the greatest importance to my interest
and happiness. Influenced by that consi∣deration,
I have applied for the necessary
passport, to be granted immediately after
the affairs of the Loan Office are finally
adjusted. I cannot say that I entertain any
great hopes of success; and most of my
friends are of opinion, I shall meet a
refusal; in which case I must be content
with a circuitous and expensive passage by
way of the West Indies. Reduced as I
am in my circumstances, how I am to raise
the necessary supply is a very serious con∣sideration;
but I will not agitate my mind
with the concerns of a future day. It is
a proof of imbecility to—“shape the fa∣shion
of uncertain evils.”</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="400"/>
<DATE>April 12.</DATE></P>
<P>My application for permission to enter
the British lines is positively rejected; I
must therefore be content to take my pas∣sage
by way of the French islands.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>May 1.</DATE></P>
<P>I have taken my leave of Hunting Ridge,
and trust I am on the point of bidding
farewel to Maryland. The concerns of the
Loan Office will, I hope, be adjusted in a
few days; I have agreed for my passage in
a vessel bound from Alexandria in Virginia
to Martinique, from which place I shall pur∣sue
the path which Providence may direct.</P>
<P>Annapolis, <DATE>June 1.</DATE></P>
<P>The affairs of the Loan Office were
closed but yesterday; when my colleague
and myself obtained a most ample and ho∣nourable
discharge from that employment.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="401"/>
The ship I proposed sailing in is yet at
Alexandria, but her destination is changed,
she being ordered to Bourdeaux, and her
departure uncertain.</P>
<P>Mr. D—, who was to have partici∣pated
in my fortune, has taken his passage
in an armed schooner, which, in my cir∣cumstances,
I do not conceive to be an
eligible method; I shall therefore leave
him to his chance, and pursue myself
another course.</P>
<P>Mr. C—sets out this day for his de∣lectable
retirement on Hunting Ridge.
When shall we meet again?—I most fer∣vently
hope he will be permitted to en∣joy
his humble retreat without fear of
molestation: at all events he must be
greatly embarrassed to support his nume∣rous
family with any degree of comfort.
Indeed he will have full occasion for the
exertion of his utmost fortitude; but his
<PB N="354" REF="402"/>
established character, and his manly, ge∣nerous
disposition, must secure to him at∣tention
and respect, under every change of
fortune.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <DATE>June 4.</DATE></P>
<P>Yesterday I received my passport, and
wait only the arrival of the post on Friday
to determine my course. I have written
to my friend Mr. C—, who is a mem∣ber
of congress, on the subject of obtain∣ing
permission to enter the British lines;
and have represented in the strongest terms
I was able, “the peculiarity of my situa∣tion,
and my total incapacity to support
the heavy additional expense which must
attend a voyage to Europe by way of
the Islands: I have also urged domestic
motives: in short, I have suggested
every reason which can induce compli∣ance;
I have even requested to be con∣sidered
as a prisoner upon parole, and
<PB N="355" REF="403"/>
have offered to remain in Philadelphia,
or in some American post, until I can,
by application to my friends in New
York, obtain some person, in a civil ca∣pacity,
to be exchanged for me.”</P>
<P>Should I succeed in this attempt, it is
possible I may be relieved, in a few days,
from a state of inexpressible anxiety, by re∣ceiving
intelligence respecting those who
occupy every thought; and whose interest
and happiness are the primary objects of
my attention. If I fail, I must submit to
the disappointment with fortitude, sup∣ported
by the reflection, that I have di∣rected
my best efforts to the accomplish∣ment
of my wishes; and that the failure
has not proceeded from any neglect on my
part, or any impropriety of conduct. At
all events, on Saturday or Sunday, I shall
set out for Philadelphia, or cross the Che∣sapeak,
and proceed to an inlet on the east∣ern
<PB N="356" REF="404"/>
shore; from which I am informed,
there are frequent opportunities of passing
to the French islands.</P>
<P>I mentioned that we had obtained a most
honourable discharge from our late provin∣cial
department, as I am well convinced
it will be highly pleasing to you to learn
any circumstance which reflects credit on
my reputation, I give you the following
extract from the report to both houses.</P>
<Q>“Your committee further take leave
to report that, from the multi∣plicity
of business, the nature of
the trust, and the care and re∣gularity

have been very inadequate to the
services they have rendered the

<P><PB N="357" REF="405"/>
Mr. D—is in hourly expectation of

passage for France; I mean to intrust this
packet to his care, and should he be de∣tained
till Friday evening, I shall be able
to inform you particularly what route I in∣tend
to pursue.</P>
<P>General Washington is said to be in
great force, and in possession of a strong
country in the vicinity of Brunswick; it
is therefore probable, that some important
event will speedily happen, which may
bring this fatal contest to a decisive issue.
It seems, however, to be a prevailing opi∣nion,
that Sir William Howe will find
great difficulty in forcing his wary oppo∣nent
to a general action, unless obvious
advantages justify the measure.</P>
<P>Friday Even. <DATE>June 6.</DATE></P>
<P>My fate is determined. Reasonable as
my requisition appeared, it cannot possibly

the only means afforded me, under
a perfect conviction of this great truth,
that “Whatever is, is right.”</P>
<P>Saturday Morn. <DATE>June 7.</DATE></P>
<P>A more certain method offers than by
way of the eastern shore. So far I appear
successful. Last night a vessel arrived off
Annapolis, bound to Cape François in
Hispaniola, from whence, to Jamaica, the
distance is not considerable. I have agreed
with the master for my passage, and to∣morrow
we are to sail for our destined port.</P>
<P>How strange are the events of hu∣man

I still cherish a grateful attachment.</P>

Saturday Even.</P>
<P>I have taken leave of the few faithful
friends still residing in Annapolis. Per∣haps
a final one! It is a painful distressing
idea! But I am hastening to those, my
separation from whom I have so long felt,
and lamented. That thought will firmly
support me under every anxious trial it may
be yet my fortune to encounter. I shall
embark in a few minutes.—So will Mr.
D—, as his vessel is likewise in the har∣bour,
and ready for sea. Our projected
route, though aiming at the same point, is
widely different. I shall deliver this to his
care. Should he accomplish his passage,
agreeable to his wishes, he must reach
England long before I can possibly expect
that happiness. Adieu!—</P>

<P>On board his Majesty's Ship Emerald,
Capes of Virginia, <DATE>July 2, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>AFTER encountering a variety of
perplexing and vexatious circum∣stances,
I have been met with success
beyond my most sanguine expectations.
The most agreeable prospects are opening
to my view; and I shall speedily obtain
ample compensation for those various anx∣ieties
which have so long disturbed my
repose.</P>
<P>My last intimated that I had taken my
passage from Maryland, in a vessel bound
to Cape François, in the island of Hispa∣niola.
On the evening of the seventh of
June, I took an affectionate leave of our
few Annapolitan friends; and, I need not
say, such were my sensations on the occa∣sion,
<PB N="361" REF="409"/>
that I repaired on board the ship des∣tined
to convey me from that province, with
a mind greatly distressed and agitated.</P>
<P>It would have evinced the utmost in∣sensibility
to have quitted without such
feelings, the scene of former happiness and
prosperity. I reflected on the obligations
we had received; the benefits we had ex∣perienced,
and the connexions we had
formed. I could not resist the united im∣pressions
excited by such interesting ideas;
nor did I quit my pensive station on the
deck, while a single object could be distin∣guished
that so forcibly reminded me of
past felicity.</P>
<P>Soon as the day dawned on the eighth,
we weighed anchor, and stood down the
bay with a propitious gale. I found two
gentlemen on board, proprietors of the ves∣sel
and cargo; knowing them well, I pro∣mised
myself great satisfaction from their
<PB N="362" REF="410"/>
society, and my expectations were com∣pletely
gratified.</P>
<P>As we passed the mouth of Patuxent,
I beheld, with emotions of gratitude, the
hospitable mansion of our benevolent friend.
Those doors which ever opened with equal
alacrity, to the weary traveller, and to the
opulent guest, are now forsaken, even by
the generous worthy owner!—The colo∣nel,
his lady and family, are retired into
the interior country, that they may be fur∣ther
removed from the inevitable calami∣ties
of war.</P>
<P>Our passage down the bay was tedious;
the winds proving variable. On Saturday
the 14th, when we were standing in for
York River, in order to obtain informa∣tion,
and to avail ourselves of a proper
opportunity to prosecute our course, we
descried a British ship in chase of an Ame∣rican
sloop. My sensations on this occa∣sion,
<PB N="363" REF="411"/>
were such as I cannot possibly deli∣neate;
and I could scarce refrain expres∣sing
a wish, that the English colours were
flying on our ensign staff. The master of
our vessel, and my fellow passengers were,
for some time, apprehensive of danger;
and I believe we were greatly indebted for
our escape to some considerable shoals,
which rendered the navigation extremely
intricate and dangerous. Our captain being
an expert seaman, profited by the advan∣tages
he possessed; and, in a short time,
we were safely at an anchor, opposite to the
town of York, and close beneath the stern
of an American frigate.</P>
<P>My companions, though well inclined
to government, expressed much satisfac∣tion
on finding themselves secure within
the limits of an American port, for had
they been captured, notwithstanding their
sentiments were loyal, their property would
<PB N="364" REF="412"/>
have been justly forfeited, as they were
attempting to support an illicit commerce.
To this measure they were, however, re∣duced
by absolute necessity; it was the
only means they could possibly devise to
quit their wretched country, without em∣barrassing
their friends and relatives, who
were compelled, by unavoidable circum∣stances,
to continue in the province.</P>
<P>These gentlemen finding the capes ef∣fectually
guarded by several of his Majes∣ty's
ships, and being, consequently, con∣vinced
that it was impracticable to pass
them with any degree of safety, deter∣mined
to remain in Virginia, until a more
favourable opportunity presented itself.
This determination by no means accorded
with my wishes. The least detention ap∣peared
hostile to my happiness; and under
my peculiar circumstances, if no motives
of a superior nature had operated, I could
<PB N="365" REF="413"/>
not support, without the greatest incon∣venience,
the accumulated expence which
unavoidably must have attended such a
measure. I therefore began to devise some
proper method of abandoning a situation
which threatened a tedious and painful ob∣struction
to the renewal of our domestic
intercourse.</P>
<P>Animated by such considerations, I re∣solved
on an immediate application to the
officer, who commanded the provincial
troops in that district. To this gentleman
I explained my particular situation, with∣out
the least reserve: the pressing motives
which required my immediate presence in
England: the disappointment I had sus∣tained
by the detention of our vessel, and
the advantages which would arise to me by
a permission to be put on board one of the
British cruizers, from whence, by way of
New York, I might obtain a speedy con∣veyance
<PB N="366" REF="414"/>
to my family and connexions in
Europe. To corroborate assertions, found∣ed
on the strictest truth, I submitted to
his consideration the passport which had
been granted to me by the ruling powers
in Maryland.</P>
<P>I was heard by this officer with candid
attention, and the propriety of my plea was
readily admitted—he could not conceive
the necessity of waiting a distant opportu∣nity,
or of prosecuting my voyage by way
of the West Indies, therefore advised me
to proceed immediately to Hampton, where
some Virginian gentlemen, adherents to
the former government, were on the point
of embarking for New York, under the
operation of an act of their legislature; and
he was persuaded, on an explicit represen∣tation
of my case, I should not find any
difficulty in being permitted to avail my∣self
of the benefit of the flag, under the
<PB N="367" REF="415"/>
protection of which those persons were pre∣paring
to quit the colony.</P>
<P>You will admit that I dispatched this
important concern with becoming spirit
and expedition, for on Monday the 16th,
I exchanged reciprocal wishes with my
Maryland friends, and left them to pursue
fortune agreeably to the mode they had
adopted.</P>
<P>About noon, the weather being intensely
hot, I embarked in a small open boat for
the place of my destination, which was
about ten leagues nearer to the sea. The
capes opened to our view a considerable
time before we obtained sight of Hampton,
and I anticipated the happiness I expected
shortly to experience, by passing them on
a more eligible plan than necessity had ori∣ginally
suggested. I fondly conceived that
I had almost surmounted every difficulty,
and could not avoid congratulating my∣self
<PB N="368" REF="416"/>
on the happy address by which I had
so fortunately converted an apparent disap∣pointment
into such real advantage. Sup∣ported
by these ideas, I experienced but
little inconvenience during several hours
that I was confined in a very limited and
exposed situation; and scarcely had I reach∣ed
my desired harbour, where a new scene
of operations was to commence, before
a tremendous gale arose, which raged
for several hours with incredible violence,
and threatened inevitable destruction to
those who were exposed to its fury. Per∣haps
I was wrong: but I could not avoid
drawing the most favourable conclusions
from this dreadful elementary war: I con∣sidered
my escape as an undoubted prelude
to future prosperity; and I experienced a
confidence in my mind which led me boldly
forward to the completion of my arduous
design. But scarce had I landed on the
beach ere I experienced a disappointment
<PB N="369" REF="417"/>
which overthrew all my late hopes. Those
gentlemen, in whose fortune I trusted to
have participated, and for which pur∣pose
I had strained my utmost abilities,
and hazarded the most imminent danger,
were embarked the preceding evening, and
left melancholy impressions on the minds
of their friends, on account of the sudden,
and violent tempest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author had the satisfaction to learn, on his ar∣rival at New York, that they had safely accomplished their passage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How to extricate myself from the difficul∣ties
which now surrounded me I knew not.
I was in a place where I had not the slightest
connexion; and where the appearance of a
stranger was a sufficient motive to excite
suspicion. Time, however, was precious:
I therefore determined not to lose a mo∣ment.
It was generally known in Mary∣land
that I had taken my passage by way
of the islands; and it was possible I might
<PB N="370" REF="418"/>
meet some person from that province,
who would throw insurmountable obstacles
in my way, by representing my intentions
in an unfavourable point of view. Agi∣tated
by such apprehensions, and encou∣raged
by the success which had attended
my application at York Town, I waited
instantly on the commanding officer, and,
assuming a confidence necessary in my situ∣ation,
intimated the circumstances of my
disappointment, by the necessity of taking
shelter in York River; the motives which
had brought me to that place, in conse∣quence
of it, and the inexpressible mor∣tification
I had experienced by arriving too
late to avail myself of so favourable an op∣portunity.
I therefore entreated that he
would facilitate a re-union with my family
and connexions, by granting me the in∣dulgence
of a flag, under the conduct of
which I might obtain a temporary situation
on board one of the British ships stationed
<PB N="371" REF="419"/>
in the vicinity of the capes, until an op∣portunity
offered to convey me to some
port, from whence I might find a ready
passage to England.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the war,
I had established it as a fixed principle,
that they who were actually engaged in
hostile opposition, were directed by more
liberal sentiments than those inflammatory
demagogues, who had arisen to eminence
by fomenting discontents, and taking a
distinguished lead in popular assemblies;
and experience, on various occasions, has
fully confirmed the truth of this obser∣vation.</P>
<P>In Hampton, fortunately for me, all
public affairs were under military directi∣on:
the person who commanded, attended
with complacency to my application; and
expressed an earnest sollicitude to render
<PB N="372" REF="420"/>
me every possible service consistent with
his duty.</P>
<P>On the following day (the 17th) this
business was more fully investigated in pre∣sence
of the officer who directed the marine
department; and, on my delivering the
passport, which had been granted for my
departure from Maryland, no reasons ap∣peared
to operate against compliance with
my request; therefore to my inexpressible
joy, leave was immediately granted to en∣gage
a vessel for my passage, and a gen∣tleman
was deputed to attend me with a
flag, as soon as I gave intimation that I
was ready for my departure.</P>
<P>Favourable as appearances now were, it
was my fate still to encounter disappoint∣ment:
I found infinite difficulty in pro∣curing
a boat, from a settled persuasion
that, notwithstanding a flag was granted,
it was dangerous to rely on that privilege.
<PB N="373" REF="421"/>
Every hour's delay increased my disquie∣tude;
yet it was not until about noon on
the 20th, that I was able to accomplish
my purpose.</P>
<P>When the necessary arrangements for
our departure were made, I rendered my
grateful acknowledgments where they were
so justly due, and, accompanied by the
officer who was appointed to conduct me,
repaired to the landing place, where a ves∣sel
was waiting for our reception. Unfor∣tunately
at that critical period, the wind
freshened to a perfect gale; the sea run
high, and my companion, from an appre∣hension
of danger, intimated his resolution
to postpone the undertaking till the wea∣ther
was more moderate. It was in vain
that I urged every motive to alter his
determination; my best arguments were
ineffectual; and, with inexpressible re∣luctance,
I was obliged to relinquish my
<PB N="374" REF="422"/>
design, and wait the event of the ensuing
day.</P>
<P>Anxious with respect to the great con∣cern
which occupied my mind, a short time
before sunset I repaired to the harbour, to
gain information relative to the state of
the weather, and the probable time when
it might be adviseable to resume our un∣dertaking.
The person, whose schooner I
had engaged, comforted me with the most
favourable intelligence, and advised me to
be on board by the dawn of day, that ad∣vantage
might be derived from the land
breeze, which generally prevailed at that
season of the year, till the sun had at∣tained
a considerable height above the ho∣rizon.
With alacrity I hastened to com∣municate
these particulars to the officer
who had been appointed to attend me,
when I received intelligence which discon∣certed
every plan, and presented to my de∣jected
<PB N="375" REF="423"/>
view, a gloomy prospect of insur∣mountable
difficulties. In short, he in∣formed
me, that the battalion then quar∣tered
in Hampton, had that instant re∣ceived
orders to march, early on the fol∣lowing
morning, to join the grand army
under command of General Washington;
and that consequently he could not gratify
his own feelings by forwarding my inten∣tions
of quitting America.</P>
<P>This intimation, so sudden, so unex∣pected,
affected my mind in the most sen∣sible
manner. The officer to whom I had
delivered my passport, had already taken
his departure, and though I could obtain
evidence that I had been in possession of
such a credential, yet I might have to ne∣gotiate
with people of a less liberal and
more suspicious nature. Part of another
regiment was hourly expected, to the com∣manding
officer of which I should be ne∣cessitated
<PB N="376" REF="424"/>
to renew my application. Delay,
in every point of view, being replete with
danger, I hastened back to the wharf, and
candidly acquainted the master of the ves∣sel
with the foregoing circumstances, re∣minding
him that, as a full authority still
existed for his receiving me on board, he
could not possibly incur any censure by the
prosecution of our design, as soon as the
favourable moment offered to proceed on
our destined course.</P>
<P>My arguments, though strongly urged,
did not appear to produce conviction; he
conceived a flag was absolutely requisite to
protect him from being captured; and
that by venturing to conduct me without
that security, he might entail ruin on him∣self
and family. I attempted to combat
his objections, by alleging, that the very
circumstance of conveying a British sub∣ject,
who had undoubted credentials to
<PB N="377" REF="425"/>
secure the most favourable reception, would
effectually prevent any consequences pre∣judicial
to his safety or his interest. I re∣monstrated
to the wind; he appeared in∣flexibly
determined; and it was, with the
utmost difficulty, that at length I persuaded
him to reflect maturely on the reasons I
had advanced, and to give me, within two
hours, his ultimate resolution.</P>
<P>You will readily conceive the agitation
of my mind during this painful interval,
especially as a hint had been given me, that
the officer who commanded the gallies,
and who, on repeated occasions, had ap∣proved
himself a zealous partizan, had,
in the course of the day, intimated an al∣teration
of sentiment, relative to the mea∣sures
necessary to be pursued, previous to
my departure from the colony. This offi∣cer
seemed to apprehend an application
ought to be made, on my part, to the legis∣lative
<PB N="378" REF="426"/>
authority; and that the permission
which had been granted was insufficient,
without the sanction of the civil power.
A journey to Williamsburgh must have
been the consequence of such an opinion
being adopted; and, perhaps, even then,
on representing my situation to the Coun∣cil
of Safety in that city, it might have
been thought expedient to apply to the
government of Maryland, for authentic
documents to corroborate my assertions.
Such a proceeding must, inevitably, have
been attended with a tedious delay, and
with increased expence; not to mention
the strong probability, that a positive pro∣hibition
would have been the consequence
of such a reference.</P>
<P>Under these peculiar circumstances it was
absolutely necessary that <HI>I</HI> should appear
perfectly collected, in order to remove all
suspicion of my pursuing indirect measures
<PB N="379" REF="427"/>
to accomplish my purpose. I therefore
joined a party, with whom I had occa∣sionally
associated since my residence in
Hampton, and discussed with them the
circumstance of the sudden departure of
the battalion, and the objections unexpect∣edly
started by the master of the vessel,
against receiving me without the formality
of a flag. I acquainted them, that an offi∣cer
had accompanied me to the wharf,
who had avowed his authority to be my
conductor, but was prevented from execut∣ing
his commission by a sudden violent
gale, which had impressed his mind with
apprehension of danger; therefore, con∣ceiving
the master fully justified in pro∣ceeding
on the permission already granted,
I requested the sentiments of those gen∣tlemen
with respect to the conduct neces∣sary
to be adopted for his entire satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="428"/>
I was heard with the most obliging
attention, and it appeared to be their unani∣mous
opinion, that I had complied with
every requisite; that I was not actuated by
any hostile intentions against America; that
I had an undoubted right to avail myself
of the most immediate opportunity to ob∣tain
a passage to Europe; and that the
master of the schooner, who had been
publicly engaged to convey me on board a
British ship, could not possibly be subjected
to any censure by the civil authority in
Virginia; nor would he encounter any ha∣zard
with regard to the detention of his
person and property, by the officers and
seamen in his Majesty's service.</P>
<P>Though I was happy in hearing senti∣ments
so perfectly agreeable to my wishes,
yet I experienced much agitation, lest they
might not prove effectual where it was imme∣diately
necessary they should be attended to;
<PB N="381" REF="429"/>
and a considerable time elapsed, beyond the
limited period, before I received intimation
that the party in question had made enquiry
for me.</P>
<P>In an instant I determined to make this
transaction a public concern, and to re∣ceive
his determination in presence of those
who had so kindly evinced a solicitude
for my welfare: he was therefore requested
to enter the room, and to deliver his opi∣nion
without reserve.</P>
<P>The undisguised conduct which I as∣sumed
on this very interesting occasion,
instantly operated in my favour. The
master expressed his doubts in a less forcible
manner; and they were answered by per∣sons
totally unconnected with my views,
with whom he was well acquainted, and
who could not possibly be governed by any
motives prejudicial to his welfare or repu∣tation.
The event more than answered
<PB N="382" REF="430"/>
my expectations: the arguments adduced
on my behalf; the persons by whom they
were delivered; and the open manner in
which I had submitted to investigation,
carried conviction to his mind; he engaged
to receive me without any further applica∣tion,
and promised to be ready for me
by the earliest dawn.</P>
<P>It was late before I retired to my apart∣ment,
and then without the least propen∣sity
to partake of rest: I threw myself on
the bed, and yielded to a successive train of
gloomy apprehensions. Indeed my situa∣tion
was extremely intricate: early in the
evening I had seen two persons, whom I
knew to be residents in Annapolis; I had
endeavoured to avoid them, but perceiving
myself discovered, I assumed an air of con∣fidence,
accosted them with apparent com∣posure,
and enquired after the welfare of
several, with whom I had been happily
<PB N="383" REF="431"/>
connected in better times. They knew I
had taken my departure for the West
Indies, and appeared inquisitive concerning
the motives which had occasioned my con∣tinuance
on the continent. In brief terms
I intimated the disappointment we had en∣countered,
and the necessity of awaiting a
more favourable opportunity; that the
vessel was still lying in York River, and
that I had been led into that neighbour∣hood
on a visit of friendship and curiosity.</P>
<P>Though my detail appeared to gain cre∣dit,
I had some reason to conceive, that
they entertained suspicions of my real
design, which they might consequently
attempt to frustrate, by immediate mea∣sures
to my disadvantage. However I had
sufficient resolution to invite them to my
quarters, and obtained a ready assurance
that they would see me early on the en∣suing
<PB N="384" REF="432"/>
day, to receive my commands for
Maryland.</P>
<P>This event was an additional motive to
urge dispatch; and it also pointed out the
method necessary to pursue, if I found the
master of the vessel inflexible to my argu∣ments:
I determined, in that case, to re∣ceive
my unwelcome visitors with an ap∣pearance
of satisfaction, and if they were
returning to Annapolis, by way of York
Town, even offer to accompany them to
that place, as to the proper situation where
I was awaiting an opportunity to proceed
for the ocean.</P>
<P>Having, after our separation, succeeded
in my plan of engaging an immediate con∣veyance
to the nearest British ship, I well
knew that the attempt, without success,
would expose me to dangers and difficul∣ties
of the most alarming nature. My new
found acquaintance might be more early in
<PB N="385" REF="433"/>
their enquiries, than was consistent with
the plan I had adopted. On learning that
I had amused them with a fallacious ac∣count,
an alarm might be instantly given,
which might occasion a pursuit; and a
contrary wind, or bad failing, might throw
me into the power of those who would put
the most unfavourable construction on my
conduct; and perhaps punish me with a
rigour by no means proportioned to the
nature of the supposed offence. These
painful ideas occupied my mind till the
appearance of day. I was to receive no∣tice
when the proper period arrived for
embarkation; and I waited the summons,
with equal impatience and anxiety. My
baggage, which was contained in a small
portmanteau, had been on board the vessel
from the time I had engaged her for my
passage; and two or three trifling articles
which I had retained on shore, were
the whole of my incumbrance. About
<PB N="386" REF="434"/>
half past four, a lad arrived, with intelli∣gence
that all was ready for my reception.
I delivered my parcel to his care and ac∣companied
him to the adjacent beach, under
no small agitation of mind, which it was
highly incumbent on me to conceal, by a
steady appearance of confidence and se∣renity.</P>
<P>For the present I lay down my pen, but
shall resume it by every convenient oppor∣tunity.
Situated as I now am, I have full
time to be circumstantial in my detail; an
indifferent person might accuse me of pro∣lixity,
but I am persuaded you experience
a real concern in whatever relates to my
interest or happiness. Farewel!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>On board the Emerald, <DATE>July 3d, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>THE schooner, destined for my con∣veyance,
was navigated by an elderly
man, and by a youth about fourteen years
of age. With a view to guard against
accidents, and to animate my companions
to perseverance, I had laid in a supply of
refreshments for a voyage much longer
than ours promised to be, and we quitted
the harbour with a favourable breeze, and
the most pleasing prospect of an expeditious
passage.</P>
<P>We had not proceeded far on our course,
before our attention was divided by the
sight of two British frigates. One was
stationed in the vicinity of the capes; and
<PB N="388" REF="436"/>
the other at some distance up the bay, in a
situation to observe the movements in York
River. The former vessel being nearer to
the sea, appeared most eligible for my de∣sign,
and to that we directed our course ac∣cordingly:
but scarce had we digested our
plan, when the wind suddenly subsided,
and a total calm succeeded, during the con∣tinuance
of which we were unable to make
the least progress: about noon, a strong
breeze set in directly opposite to our
wishes; we made many tacks, without
seeming to obtain the least advantage; and
though, under this disappointment, I suf∣fered
extreme agitation, yet had I resolu∣tion
to affect a perfect serenity, that I might
not increase suspicions in the mind of my
conductor, who could not avoid occasionally
intimating his apprehensions, that he en∣countered
a considerable hazard in the un∣dertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="437"/>
It is impossible to paint the distress
that took possession of my soul, when
the impracticability of reaching the ship,
at least that evening, was announced in the
most decided terms. A strong head-sea
operated equally with the wind to baffle
our best attempts; the master, therefore,
proposed to return into the harbour, and
patiently await the event of the succeeding
day. To this measure I strongly objected,
and recommended altering our course for
the other vessel, which I conceived we
could easily attain before the approach of
night; but was exceedingly mortified to
hear him explicitly dissent from my opi∣nion;
when no choice was left me but to
return to an anchor, in order to take the
advantage of a more favourable opportu∣nity.</P>
<P>This determination, so cruelly adverse
to my hopes, rendered me almost frantic
<PB N="390" REF="438"/>
with apprehension. I recollected my An∣napolitan
acquaintance, and the probability
that they had excited an alarm, on account
of the deception I had practised, from un∣avoidable
necessity. I had also reason to
entertain ideas of dangers and difficulties
from every other quarter, and I knew not
how to stem the torrent of adversity which
appeared ready to overwhelm me. We
were now before the wind, standing directly
for the harbour, to which we were advancing
with a very rapid progress: one expedient
only remained, which a sudden thought
suggested: I had plied my old pilot as
freely with the bottle, as was not in∣consistent
with our safety; and he evi∣dently
discovered, in consequence of it,
a greater pliability of disposition. I availed
myself of the important crisis, and under
the plausible pretext of saving time, and
being more ready to catch the first breath
of a propitious breeze, I proposed running
<PB N="391" REF="439"/>
under a cliff to leeward of the town, where
the riding was perfectly convenient; and
where I trusted we might remain undisco∣vered,
till we could again, with propriety,
resume our arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>To my infinite satisfaction, and, indeed,
equal surprise, my plan received his im∣mediate,
and entire approbation: we were
quickly at an anchor behind a point of
land, which entirely sheltered us from the
view of the adjacent harbour; our little
vessel was soon properly secured; the day
closed with perfect serenity; and the vete∣ran
seaman and his boy, after partaking of
such cheer as our stock afforded, calmly
resigned themselves to repose, without an
anxious idea respecting the operations of
the ensuing day.</P>
<P>Contrasted with mine, their situation
was indeed most enviable—agitated by con∣flicting
passions! by a continued series of
<PB N="392" REF="440"/>
disappointments, I tamely yielded to the
pressure of calamity! and even dreaded the
return of day, which was to expose me to
new trials, and probably to additional mor∣tifications:
I weakly anticipated a train of
impending evils, which I considered as un∣avoidable.</P>
<P>The night was uncommonly splendid.
The beams of the rising moon were beau∣tifully
reflected on the noble expanse of
water. Nature appeared perfectly serene;
and every surrounding object contributed
to elevate the imagination above terrestrial
objects; to infuse a calm indifference
with regard to sublunary events; and to
suggest a firm confidence, in the great,
beneficent Creator! Yet, harrassed by the
corroding reflections which incessantly in∣truded,
I became insensible to all that
could dignify the mind; the delightful
prospect became a dreary waste; and I no
<PB N="393" REF="441"/>
longer recollected the providential delive∣rances
I had so frequently, and so unex∣pectedly
experienced.</P>
<P>I attempted, but in vain, to compose
myself, and to obtain that rest so essen∣tial
to recruit my agitated spirits, for
the transactions of the approaching morn∣ing:
but every effort was ineffectual,
I therefore determined to occupy the te∣dious
interval by an excursion on the adja∣cent
shore. Our vessel lay almost close to
the beach, and a small canoe, which was
fastened to our stern, enabled me, in an in∣stant,
to gratify my inclination. My com∣rades,
exempt from every anxiety, were
in perfect enjoyment of the most sound
repose; and I landed, without their being
sensible of the intention I had formed.
By this time, the moon had nearly at∣tained
her meridian height; the hemi∣sphere
was decorated with unnumbered
<PB N="394" REF="442"/>
stars, and not an intervening cloud ap∣peared,
to obstruct the view. I had at∣tained
a considerable eminence, at no re∣mote
distance from the place of our an∣chorage;
and from that situation, I could
plainly distinguish the town of Hampton;
several vessels lying at the mouth of the
harbour; an unlimited prospect of the
Chesapeak; and, just rising above the ho∣rison,
the British frigate, the object of my
most ardent hopes! Such a grand assem∣blage
of interesting objects gradually dis∣sipated
the gloom which hung over me;
a returning ray of confidence took full
possession of my soul; the eventful cir∣cumstances
of my preceding days, passed
rapidly in review before my imagination;
I yielded to an instantaneous impulse I
found myself unable to resist, and pros∣trate
on the shore, acknowledged the
imb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cility of human nature, and implored
<PB N="395" REF="443"/>
the all-merciful Providence to support me,
under every future vicissitude, and direct
my wandering steps to the paths of peace
and safety.</P>
<P>Supported and elevated by hope, I de∣scended,
like a new being, to the adjacent
beach, and hastened along the shore to pre∣pare
for the ensuing enterprize. Scarce
had I reached the vessel, before the wel∣come
dawn, and a rising favourable breeze,
intimated the expediency of commencing
our operations. I awakened my compa∣nions,
and apprized them of the promising
gale:—in an instant we were under way,
and stood, with a pleasing prospect of suc∣cess,
for the frigate, which, during the
preceding day, had been the earnest object
of our attention.</P>
<P>I now began to conceive, that fortune,
weary of persecuting me, was determined
<PB N="396" REF="444"/>
to make ample compensation for the mor∣tification
and disquietude I had sustained;
but I was destined to encounter yet fur∣ther
trials, under circumstances of more
imminent danger.</P>
<P>When we were within two leagues of
the ship, and at the moment that I was
anticipating the happiness which awaited
me, the breeze suddenly headed us, and
quickly freshened to a perfect gale. Our
schooner, unfortunately, was foul; her sails
and rigging in bad condition; and we had,
in the course of our former attempt, fully
experienced her inability to work to wind∣ward.
In this dilemma, a consultation
took place, the result of which was, a de∣termination
to change our course, for the
ship which was stationed up the bay; and
the master gave me great hopes that we
should carry our point, without much dif∣ficulty,
if the wind continued steady in its
<PB N="397" REF="445"/>
present quarter. To animate his exer∣tions,
and attach him more strongly to my
interest, I promised a handsome augmenta∣tion
to our stipulated agreement; and in
return, he assured me, that he would per∣severe
to the utmost, and at all events not
shelter in any harbour, unless absolute ne∣cessity
enforced him.</P>
<P>We had still serious embarrassments to
encounter. A heavy cross sea greatly im∣peded
our progress, and frequently broke
over the deck in an alarming manner.
The wind also became scant, and we barely
lay our course. Hope, however, was pre∣dominant;
I found we gradually gained on
our object; my comrades appeared con∣fident
of success; and I had a firm per∣suasion
that our expectations would be ef∣fectually
gratified. Thus circumstanced,
I resolved, if possible, to obtain a short
repose; the agitation of my mind, and the
<PB N="398" REF="446"/>
extreme fatigue I had experienced, had
totally exhausted nature; I therefore sum∣moned
resolution to retire to my birth,
having previously given directions to be
awakened before our arrival at the ship; or
if any unforeseen event should take place,
which might require my attention or as∣sistance.</P>
<P>It was about ten in the forenoon, when
I threw myself on my pillow, and in a
few minutes every anxious idea was oblite∣rated
by a profound sleep; but scarce an
hour had elapsed before I was alarmed by
a summons upon deck, and in a tone which
instantly filled my mind with a dread of
impending evil. I sprung instantly from
my cot, and in a moment was too perfectly
convinced, that I had the strongest reasons
to apprehend the most disagreeable conse∣quences.
We plainly descried an armed
schooner, stretching from the land, with
<PB N="399" REF="447"/>
an evident intention to intercept our pas∣sage
to the ship, from which we were at
that time, about two miles distant; and
as she gained rapidly upon us, I began to
abandon that confidence which had so re∣cently
taken possession of my breast.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the depression which
almost overpowered my faculties, I assumed
sufficient resolution to animate my com∣panions,
which I seconded, by promises of
greater efficacy, than the force of the most
eloquent persuasions; and the wind veering
a point or two in our favour, to my inex∣pressible
joy, we were within hail of the
ship, when the American vessel was also
within random shot, where she lay to, in
order to watch our motions, and take her
measures accordingly.</P>
<P>At this critical period it blew a fresh of
wind, accompanied with a heavy swell of
the sea; notwithstanding which, we run
<PB N="400" REF="448"/>
along-side the frigate with tolerable dexte∣rity;
but in attempting to catch a rope,
which was flung from the deck, the boy
had nearly fallen overboard, and before
another could be thrown for our assistance,
we had, in spite of every effort, fallen to
leeward with astonishing rapidity. On a
suspicion that we had acted by design, an
officer directed us immediately to bring to,
in a manner so commanding that we appre∣hended
a shot would be immediately fired
to force compliance. Obedience was
only left us; but under our circum∣stances,
obedience was attended with in∣finite
danger; our anchor, though suffi∣cient
in smooth water, was by no means
adapted for the present occasion, nor was
the cable in a condition to bear the violent
motion and working of the vessel; in seve∣ral
places it was greatly defective, and in
its best state, was only intended for har∣bours,
and occasional mooring places along
<PB N="401" REF="449"/>
the shore: necessity enforced submission;
the anchor was let go, and for some mo∣ments
I indulged hope, that a boat would
be manned, and sent from the ship, to
learn the motives which had brought us
into that perilous siuation; but in that
hope, so reasonably founded, I had quickly
the mortification to experience a disappoint∣ment,
we being again hailed, in an autho∣ritative
manner, and directed to send on
board immediately.</P>
<P>Situated as we were, it was in vain to
attempt representing the particulars which
gave me a right to expect assistance and
protection: we were unfortunately unpro∣vided
with a speaking trumpet, and the
wind setting directly against us, it was im∣possible
for the voice alone, at the dis∣tance
we were from each other, to con∣vey
an articulate sound. Our canoe was of
the smallest dimensions, and could not,
<PB N="402" REF="450"/>
even in the most serene weather, contain
more than one person, with any degree of
safety; tempestuous as it then was, the
most imminent danger awaited the attempt;
to deliberate was, at least, encountering
equal hazard: should the vessel drift, it
might be thought intentional, and a shot
might be attended with fatal effects. I
therefore entreated the master to undertake
alone, without a moment's delay, the ar∣duous
enterprise, while I continued with
his servant, to render him every assistance
in my power.</P>
<P>Whose situation was most critical, I am
utterly unable to determine: scarcely had
the canoe put off, before we became sen∣sible
that our vessel dragged upon the an∣chor,
which induced my young associate to
express the strongest fears, that our cable
could not possibly long hold out; in which
case, the least evil which threatened me
<PB N="403" REF="451"/>
was a tedious, and probably a rigid impri∣sonment,
as the armed schooner continued
lying-to, at no remote distance, and in a
very short time we must have drifted so
far to leeward, that she would have taken
us, even within random shot of that vessel
to which I fled for refuge.</P>
<P>Under circumstances so peculiarly dis∣tressing,
I anxiously attended to the mo∣tions
of the canoe. The veteran sea∣man
acquitted himself with the utmost
dexterity. Sometimes, from the height of
the sea, he was totally lost to view, which
excited a momentary sensation of the most
painful nature; but when I saw him rise
with a rising wave, hope in consequence
exhilarated my spirits. Though the dis∣tance
was not far, near an hour elapsed, be∣fore
I beheld him ascending the side of the
ship, every minute of which time, in my
peculiar situation, appeared insupportably
<PB N="404" REF="452"/>
tedious. Meanwhile our little bark con∣tinued
to pitch with great violence, and I
was under continual apprehensions, that
the strands of our weak cable must, in∣evitably,
yield to such excessive motion.
Guess then my transport, when I heard
the welcome signal given for hoisting out
a boat. My eyes were rivetted on an ob∣ject
which promised a speedy and effectual
relief. I saw her launch from the ship,
with all the wild enthusiasm of joy! and
in a few minutes I had the inexpressible
happiness to take an officer by the hand,
who delivered a friendly message from his
commander, with an obliging invitation to
partake of every accommodation his situa∣tion
could afford.</P>
<P>Thus much shall suffice for the employ∣ment
of the present day; but I shall quick∣ly
resume the pen, that I may conclude a
<PB N="405" REF="453"/>
narrative which, I am persuaded, you will
consider interesting and eventful.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Emerald, <DATE>July 5, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>THE officer who had it in charge to
convey me on board his Majesty's
ship, acquainted me that she was named
the Thames, and was commanded by Cap∣tain
Tyringham Howe, who had so re∣markably
distinguished himself in the de∣fence
of the Glasgow, when she engaged
the American fleet, under the direction of
Commodore Hopkins.</P>
<P>Against a force so wonderfully superior,
he maintained an animated contest; and,
in spite of their utmost exertions, effected
<PB N="406" REF="454"/>
a gallant retreat into the harbour at Rhode
Island. For his steady and intrepid con∣duct,
he was rewarded by a promotion into
his present ship, which, I trust, will be
only a prelude to some more honourable
distinction.</P>
<P>By Captain Howe I was received with
a cordiality which exceeded my utmost ex∣pectations.
I gave him a brief detail of
the events which had so happily terminated
in placing me under his generous protec∣tion;
and I entreated that he would ren∣der
every assistance to the master of the
schooner, by whose zealous and determined
efforts I had accomplished an escape, which
opened the prospect of a speedy restoration
to the blessings of domestic society.</P>
<P>In consequence of my requisition, im∣mediate
orders were given to secure his ves∣sel
beneath the stern of the frigate; and
<PB N="407" REF="455"/>
my old pilot, with his faithful adherent,
was received on board with assurances of
every accommodation, until a favourable
opportunity presented itself of prosecuting
their intentions with entire safety.</P>
<P>In about an hour after my arrival I sat
down with Captain H—, and several
officers, to a plain but plentiful dinner; I
experienced sensations I had long been un∣accustomed
to—my mind was exhilarated
with joy and gratitude—I acknowledged
the intervention of an all-directing Provi∣dence—and
I enjoyed a rapid succession of
these delightful ideas, which indicated a
reverse of fortune, and an ample compen∣sation
for past solicitudes.</P>
<P>On my name being occasionally menti∣oned,
it caught the attention of the first
lieutenant, who, to my great astonishment,
discovered a knowledge of my former situ∣ation.
He particularly enquired concern∣ing
<PB N="408" REF="456"/>
the welfare of my dearest wife and son,
and assured me, with uncommon warmth,
that every gentleman belonging to that
ship had, even previous to the hope of any
personal acquaintance, conceived sentiments
highly advantageous to my character and
my principles. Perceiving every counte∣nance
bore convincing testimony to the
truth of such pleasing assertions, I was
lost in amazement; and could not pene∣trate
into the mystery which had so strange∣ly
secured to me the approbation and es∣teem
of persons to whom I conceived I was
totally unknown. I therefore entreated an
immediate explanation, that I might learn
how to render my grateful acknowledg∣ments,
and to approve myself deserving
such an unexpected prepossession in my
behalf.</P>
<P>Mr. R—, the gentleman who had so
kindly expressed himself in my favour,
<PB N="409" REF="457"/>
then acquainted me that “a few weeks
since, the Thames had taken an Ame∣rican
vessel bound to a French island, on
board of which were a number of let∣ters,
which had been examined, with a
view to obtain information; that in per∣forming
this duty they had met with
two under my signature, which had im∣pressed
them so strongly in my behalf,
that it was resolved to retain them till
an opportunity offered for their safe con∣veyance.
Accordingly on the arrival of
the ship at New York, they had been
intrusted to the care of a German offi∣cer,
with particular injunctions to de∣liver
them immediately on the comple∣tion
of his voyage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. R—inclosed the intercepted letters, in a very elegant and expressive epistle from himself; and they were punctually delivered. The author is, at this time, happy in including Captain R—amongst his best and most valuable friends.</NOTE>.”—Mr. R—
concluded by observing that, “the instant
<PB N="410" REF="458"/>
my name was mentioned,” he entertained san∣guine
hopes that I was the person in whose
cause they had been so strongly interested;
and on finding those hopes so agreeably
confirmed, he was persuaded every gentle∣man
on board that ship rejoiced in the un∣expected
opportunity of affording protec∣tion
and assistance, where attachment ope∣rated
so forcibly with duty to command
their best exertions.</P>
<P>Had I not instantly conceived senti∣ments
of regard for this worthy man, I
must have been insensible to every gene∣rous,
every grateful impression.—I beheld
him with a mixture of reverence and love
—and tears—heart-felt tears—proclaimed
the genuine, the servent acknowledgments
of my soul.</P>
<P>On board the Thames I continued until
the 27th, experiencing from Captain H—
and the gentlemen under his command,
<PB N="411" REF="459"/>
the most obliging attention and hospitality.
But that ship being stationed a consider∣able
distance up the bay, I became anxious
for a removal into the Emerald, which lay
in the vicinity of the capes, whose comman∣der
consequently had it more in his power
to forward the intentions of those whose
circumstances rendered it expedient to visit
the city of New York.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the above day, an officer
in an armed vessel having arrived on some
duty from the commodore, I determined
to embrace the opportunity of his return,
that I might obtain a situation nearer to
the object of my hopes.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty I obtained the con∣sent
of Captain H—, and his benevo∣lent
officers, to this necessary measure.
They suggested the probability of being
speedily relieved, and the pleasure they
should receive in conveying me to my de∣sired
<PB N="412" REF="460"/>
haven. Though I felt the full force
of such persuasions, yet I combated their
friendly arguments with reasons so justly
founded, that my hospitable protectors
yielded reluctantly to their force; and with
their sincere prayers for the completion of
all my pursuits, I bade them farewell; and
early on the following day, was received
on board the Emerald with great attention
and politeness.</P>
<P>I have now brought you to my present
situation, where I experience every proof
of regard and humanity. Since the com∣mencement
of this contest, I have repeat∣edly
heard it asserted, that the commanders
of his Majesty's ships consider protection
rather as an act of necessity than inclina∣tion;
and that those loyalists who had,
with infinite hazard, effected an escape
from the adverse party, had been treated
by them, on application for refuge, with
<PB N="413" REF="461"/>
a distance and haughtiness, that aggravated
their sufferings, and almost alienated their
sentiments of allegiance. I verily believe
the assertion, in every instance, most un∣justly
founded; propagated by malice, and
by republican artifice. On board the Eme∣rald
are several gentlemen under similar
circumstances with myself; all equally
strangers to our benefactors, we are all
equally treated as friends and brethren.
Captain Caldwell, who is the commodore
on the station, is continually gaining on
our esteem by the affability of his manners;
his officers appear no less anxious to pro∣mote
our entire satisfaction; and we meet
with every accommodation our situation
can possibly obtain. But kindly and hu∣manely
treated as I am, happiness is not
yet my portion; my thoughts are anxiously
turned towards you and our dearest boy,
and I consider every hour a tedious delay,
till I obtain information of your health and
<PB N="414" REF="462"/>
welfare. Your letters will probably deter∣mine
my future conduct. I trust I shall
soon rejoin you in England; or by a pleas∣ing
change in the political system, be en∣abled
once more to bid you welcome to
the continent of America. May hea∣ven
grant us a speedy re-union; and may
we pass the residue of our days, without
again experiencing the insupportable anxi∣ety
of separation.</P>
<P>New York, <DATE>July 19, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>I have only a few minutes to inform
you, that yesterday I was safely landed in
this city, and met with the most cordial
reception from our invaluable friends.</P>
<P>I found but one letter from my dearest
wife, dated on the 26th of April, and 1st
of May last. On obtaining intelligence of
your welfare, my joy was inexpressible.
More than sixteen tedious months had
<PB N="415" REF="463"/>
elapsed, since the date of your last: many
of your epistles have undoubtedly miscar∣ried:
mine to you, I trust, have been
more fortunate. During the remainder of
our separation, our correspondence will be
certain. I am now free, unawed, unre∣strained.—I
feel myself enlarged; and I
will write, speak, and act, as becomes a
zealous adherent to the British constitu∣tion.</P>
<P>In my next I will give you the particu∣lars
of my expedition hither; of my pre∣sent
situation; and probably some idea of
my future intentions; but as the ship
which is to convey this is preparing to sail,
I must postpone further information.</P>
<P>Opportunities of writing from this place
very frequently offer: expect therefore to
hear from me again speedily. My volu∣minous
detail will be delivered to you by
Mr. S—, a worthy young man, and a
<PB N="416" REF="464"/>
refugee from Maryland. To him I refer
you for an account of your friends in that
province, which he quitted but a few days
since.—Adieu.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>New York, <DATE>Aug. 1, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>MY last contained a circumstantial de∣tail
from the day of my quitting
Maryland, to that of my reception on
board the Emerald frigate. I shall now
continue my narrative to the time of my
arrival in this city.</P>
<P>On the tenth of July, at day break, se∣veral
vessels were distinguished, which had
passed us by favour of the night, and
were stretching to the eastward with a
croud of canvas. In an instant we weigh∣ed
anchor, and stood out to sea. The Se∣negal
<PB N="417" REF="465"/>
sloop of war, and an armed brig,
that were stationed off Cape Charles, join∣ed
us in the chace; and before noon we
took three large sloops and two schooners
laden with tobacco, flour, and various va∣luable
commodities for the French islands.</P>
<P>The capture of these vessels was a for∣tunate
event to me, and to those who were
under similar circumstances, it being de∣termined
to send the prizes immediately to
New York, under convoy of the Senegal,
commanded by Captain Molloy.</P>
<P>On Friday the eleventh, Captain C—
introduced two gentlemen, who had es∣caped
from Virginia, and myself, to the
commander of the Senegal, and recom∣mended
us strongly to his kind attention.
On board this ship we experienced every
proof of hospitality and regard during the
passage to New York, where, on the 18th,
we were safely landed.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="466"/>
On entering the Narrows, my mind was
forcibly struck with the splendid appear∣ance
of a numerous, and formidable equip∣ment.
A grand fleet, attended with in∣numerable
transports, arranged in their
several divisions, lay at anchor off Sta∣ten
Island. The island itself was co∣vered
with troops ready for embarcation,
and every appearance indicated an expe∣dition
of the most decisive consequence.
I could not avoid contemplating, with as∣tonishment,
the power—the apparently ir∣resistable
power—of the parent state; and,
in consequence, equal astonishment took
possession of my mind, when I reflected
how ineffectual, to every salutary purpose,
the most determined efforts had hitherto
been.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. C—insist on my so∣journing
beneath their friendly roof, until
some plan is adopted for a permanent situ∣ation;
<PB N="419" REF="467"/>
and express their regret, that un∣avoidable
events have so long detained me
from experiencing their humanity and af∣fection.</P>
<P>Mr. C—is no longer Commissary Ge∣neral,
having resigned that lucrative office
with the greatest credit to his abilities and
reputation; and is now Auditor General
of accompts, a station of equal honour,
but inferior in point of emolument: it is,
however, attended with much less fatigue.</P>
<P>This alteration, though desirable to him,
is particularly unfavourable to me. His
patronage as Commissary General was very
extensive; and his inclination corresponded
with his power to render me essential ser∣vice.
He has just acquainted me that he
had, with a view to my interest, deferred
for some time the filling up a profitable
appointment; but learning that I had
taken my passage by way of the West In∣dies,
<PB N="420" REF="468"/>
he had given up all hopes of seeing
me in New York; and had, therefore,
previous to his resignation, disposed of the
employment to a gentleman who will, in
all probability, acquire thereby an ample
provision, should the war be continued for
any length of time.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that disappointment is
still to destroy our hopes of prosperity.
But it is folly—nay, it is criminal to in∣dulge
an idea of discontent. We have suf∣ficient
motives to nourish the most grate∣ful
acknowledgments: we will, therefore,
look forward with increasing confidence,
and trust to heaven alone for the disposal
of every future concern.</P>
<P>It is impossible to conceive a more mag∣nificent
appearance than was exhibited
by the departure of the grand fleet,
which on the 23d of last month, weighed
anchor, and stood to the eastward with a
<PB N="421" REF="469"/>
favourable breeze. Whither they are bound
is to the public an impenetrable secret;
but if the consequences are what might
be expected from the apparent strength of
the armament, surely the day is at hand
which will happily terminate the compli∣cated
miseries of this unnatural war.</P>
<P>There are those who appear sanguine
enough to believe, that the present campaign
will assuredly prove decisive, and restore the
ancient government. It is certain that
much may be expected from the operations
of the formidable force under the com∣mand
of Lord and General Howe; and
the utmost anxiety and impatience prevail
for intelligence of their destination and
proceedings.</P>
<P>Our worthy friend has a delightful situ∣ation
on the banks of the East River,
about five miles distant from New York,
where he principally resides during the
<PB N="422" REF="470"/>
summer. In this retirement I have a com∣fortable
apartment, where I enjoy rational
society, and an occasional retreat from the
active scenes of military arrangements.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <DATE>6th Aug.</DATE></P>
<P>I have this instant heard of a vessel pre∣paring
to sail for Liverpool; I must there∣fore
postpone an account of New York,
and its environs, to a future opportunity.
Every sail that I behold will excite the
strongest emotions of expectation. Surely
I shall now receive frequent accounts of
your health and welfare.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>York Island, <DATE>Aug. 16, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>HAPPY beneath this hospitable roof,
I seldom visit the crowded city. At
this season, the heat of the weather in town,
<PB N="423" REF="471"/>
occasioned by the confined air, and the re∣flection
of the sun, is scarcely supportable.</P>
<P>We are situated opposite to a fertile and
beautiful part of Long Island. Vessels of
every denomination are continually in view;
and a variety of pleasing and interesting
objects contribute to decorate the scene,
and to render our retirement truly delec∣table.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of our habitation, is a
very dangerous and narrow passage of the
river, the sight of which excites ideas of
greater terror than the celebrated poetical
descriptions of Scylla and Charybdis. The
tide runs with astonishing rapidity, and in
various currents, only one of which will
carry a vessel through, with any degree of
safety; for on one side there is a shoal of
rocks that barely make their appearance
above the water; and on the other, a dread∣ful
vortex, occasioned by a rock several feet
<PB N="424" REF="472"/>
beneath the surface, which attracts and
engulphs every object that approaches it.
At particular periods of the tide, this tre∣mendous
whirlpool appears to boil like
foaming cauldrons, accompanied with a
hollow terrific sound, which impresses the
most determined mind with apprehensions
of inevitable destruction. The breadth of
the river at this place is nearly half a mile,
but that of the channel does not exceed
eighty yards. This passage is only prac∣ticable
at, and near the height of tide; at
any other time it would be extreme rash∣ness
to attempt it; and under the most fa∣vourable
circumstances, the greatest know∣ledge
and dexterity are requisite in the na∣vigation.</P>
<P>Attended by some skilful boatmen, I
had the curiosity to shoot this formidable
gulf, which has, with some degree of pro∣priety,
obtained the appellation of <HI>Hell-Gate.</HI>
<PB N="425" REF="473"/>
The velocity of our motion was,
indeed, beyond credibility, through a won∣derfully
agitated stream, accompanied with
such dreadful roarings that, confident as I
was in the skill of my conductors, I heartily
repented the temerity of the undertaking,
and beheld, in imagination, the invisible
boundary “from which no traveller re∣turns.”</P>
<P>York Island extends to Kingsbridge,
about fourteen miles distant from the city;
where it is joined to the continent by a
small wooden bridge. The narrow deep
river, which runs at this place, is a suf∣ficient
security against sudden incursions;
and the works that are thrown up are so
exceedingly strong, and in such command∣ing
situations, as effectually to exclude the
idea of a regular attack.</P>
<P>The capital of this province is situated
on the southern extremity of the island:
<PB N="426" REF="474"/>
on one side runs the north, and on the other
the east river; on the latter of which, on
account of the harbour, the city is princi∣pally
built. In several streets, trees are
regularly planted, which afford a grateful
shelter during the intense heat of the sum∣mer.
The buildings are generally of brick,
and many are erected in a stile of elegance.
The situation is said to be perfectly health∣ful,
but fresh water is so very scarce, that
the purchase of this essential article is at∣tended
with a considerable expense.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the war, New York
is plentifully supplied from Long Island
with provisions of all kinds. It must,
however, be confessed, that almost every
article bears an exorbitant price, when com∣pared
with that of former happy times.
Both the north and east rivers abound with
a great variety of excellent fish. Lobsters,
of a prodigious size, were, till of late,
<PB N="427" REF="475"/>
caught in vast numbers, but it is a fact,
surprising as it may appear, that, since the
late incessant cannonading, they have en∣tirely
forsaken the coast, not one having
been taken, or seen, since the commence∣ment
of hostilities.</P>
<P>Into this place and neighbourhood, lob∣sters
were introduced by accident; the
province having been formerly supplied
with them by the fishermen of New Eng∣land,
who brought them in well-boats, one
of which, in passing Hell-Gate, striking
against a rock, separated, and the lobsters,
which escaped into their proper element,
multiplied so exceedingly, that in a short
time the markets were amply and reason∣ably
supplied.</P>
<P>Previous to the commencement of this un∣happy
war, New York was a flourishing, po∣pulous,
and beautiful town. But immedi∣ately
on the British troops taking possession,
<PB N="428" REF="476"/>
it was set on fire by some desperate incen∣diaries,
and near a third part destroyed, in
spite of the utmost exertions to prevent the
spreading conflagration. The flames, at
the same instant, burst out in a variety of
places, which rendered it evident, that this
execrable deed was perpetrated from a
principle of ill-directed zeal, in order to
preclude the royal army from a possibility
of maintaining, with the least degree of
comfort, their important acquisitions.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the late devastation,
there are still many elegant edifices remain∣ing,
which would reflect credit on any me∣tropolis
in Europe. The new church is a
noble structure: the college is spacious
and convenient: the barracks are well
built, and well accommodated. The Dutch
churches, with several places of worship
for Protestants of different persuasions, re∣flect
great credit on the genius of their ar∣chitects;
<PB N="429" REF="477"/>
and the general stile which pre∣dominates
in this city, impresses the mind
with an idea of neatness and taste.</P>
<P>The numerous fortifications thrown up
by the American troops in the vicinity of
the capital, appear to be constructed with
judgment and attention. Why they were
so precipitately abandoned is difficult to
ascertain: indeed the whole island forms a
continued chain of batteries and intrench∣ments,
which seemed to indicate the most
resolute opposition.</P>
<P>I have lately made an excursion to Long
Island, and was highly entertained in my
progress through a rich, beautiful, and
well cultivated country. At a village named
Flatbush, I met with several provincial
officers belonging to the Maryland batta∣lions,
who had been taken in different ac∣tions,
and were prisoners on parole; and
it was with real satisfaction I recognized
<PB N="430" REF="478"/>
some of my old acquaintance, and answered
their respective interrogatories relative to
their friends and connexions in that pro∣vince.</P>
<P>I have, in the course of my excursions,
traversed the whole of York Island, and
have even attended the relief of the piquet
guard without Kingsbridge, which is the
advanced post of the British army. It is
impossible to convey an adequate idea of
the interesting and noble objects which, in
every direction, strike the curious and in∣quisitive
eye. From the city of New
York, to the extent of the island, we be∣held
a regular continuation of formidable
intrenchments. The troops appear animated
in the service; and, surely, if their opera∣tions
are properly conducted, the event
cannot but effectually re-establish our an∣cient
happy constitution on a permanent
foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="479"/>
I frequently partake of a military dinner,
and have been hospitably entertained by
the officers of different corps. As I have
no real employment to occupy my time, I
often change the scene. Variety of objects
tends to prevent the intrusion of painful
reflections; yet, in spite of my best efforts,
I am almost unable to stem the tide of sor∣row,
when past blessings rise up, like phan∣toms,
to my view, and irresistably remind
me, “that such things were, and that I
once was happy.”</P>
<P>I have written by Mr. S—to Sir Ro∣bert
Eden, and have transmitted him a
minute detail of the political state of Ma∣ryland.
I have represented leading cha∣racters
with truth and impartiality; and
have endeavoured to convey a competent
idea of the military arrangements, and le∣gislative
dispositions which have taken place
in consequence of the new system of go∣vernment.

He will, probably, give you
his sentiments on the subject of my com∣munications.
—This I can safely aver, that
I have delineated circumstances in their
true light, “nor set down aught in malice.”</P>
<P><DATE>4th September.</DATE></P>
<P>I am somewhat relieved from the anxi∣ety
I have experienced. Several letters
mention the departure of a fleet for this
port, under convoy of the Bristol, which
left England previous to the sailing of the
packet; consequently they may be hourly
expected: by that opportunity I shall, as∣suredly,
receive intimation of your health
and welfare.</P>
<P>We have certain advice, thar our for∣midable
armament has proceeded up the
Chesapeak, and that the troops are landed,
in high spirits, near the head of Elk. My
friend Captain H—, who has been here
<PB N="433" REF="481"/>
some time, expects sailing orders every mi∣nute,
and solicits me to accompany him
on the cruize. Should he be directed to
Maryland, I have resolved to attend him;
for if we obtain possession of that province,
my duty and my interest will, undoubted∣ly,
require my immediate presence. But
to say truth, I cannot possibly adopt any
plan, with the least satisfaction, until I
procure information how it is with you,
and our dearest boy.</P>
<P><DATE>6th September,</DATE></P>
<P>It is confidently reported, that the city
of Annapolis, the scene of our former hap∣piness
and prosperity, is, by the inevitable
calamity of war, reduced to ashes. I need
not observe, that very many, whom we
have cause to love and esteem, will most
materially suffer in consequence of this un∣fortunate
event. I am extremely anxious
<PB N="434" REF="482"/>
to learn the fate of our loyal friends who
were necessitated, by circumstances, to re∣main
in that place, and in the neighbour∣hood.
I think it probable, that on the ap∣pearance
of the British fleet, the adherents
to government were compelled to retire
to the interior country.</P>
<P>Captain H—has not yet learned his
destination, but should he proceed to the
Chesapeak, it is my fixed intention to ac∣company
him; by which means I shall
obtain the knowledge of many material
circumstances, which it may be necessary
to impart to our suffering brethren in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The provincials have lately made an at∣tack
on Staten Island, where, during the
first confusion, they burned some stores,
and took a few prisoners; but they have
paid severely for the attempt. The alarm
instantly reached an adjacent post, and be∣fore
<PB N="435" REF="483"/>
they could effect a retreat they were
vigorously attacked. About two hundred
fell in the action, and near three hundred
surrendered to the British detachment.
Another party landed about the same time
on Long Island, but on the appearance of
opposition, quitted it with precipitation.
A strong body likewise advanced within
sight of our lines at Kingsbridge, but re∣tired
on the approach of our light infan∣try.
From these movements there is rea∣son
to believe, that an attack was meditated
on New York, in the absence of our grand
army; but, happily, a sufficient force is
left to baffle the best concerted attempt.</P>
<P><DATE>13th September.</DATE></P>
<P>I have, impatiently, expected particulars
relative to Annapolis; but, as nothing fur∣ther
is yet circulated, I am inclined to in∣dulge
hope that the account which was
propagated is without foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="484"/>
Nothing of real importance has yet trans∣pired
from Lord Howe and the general;
which is rather extraordinary, as we have
had certain information of our troops hav∣ing
effected a landing at the head of the
Chesapeak; and that they were in the vi∣cinity
of the American army.</P>
<P>A report is circulated, that General
Burgoyne has totally defeated the northern
army, under the command of General
Gates. If true—the consequences must
be glorious and decisive.</P>
<P>The Bristol, and her convoy, are hour∣ly
expected—but by no one with more im∣patience
than by your faithful, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>New York, <DATE>Sept. 20, 1777.</DATE></P>
<P>WE have intelligence of the most in∣teresting
and pleasing nature. It
is said that General Washington has suf∣fered
a total defeat in the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia. Should this report, which
is generally credited, be well founded, this
destructive war will surely be quickly ter∣minated.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform you, that the ac∣count
respecting Annapolis was totally
without foundation. Hitherto Maryland
has not experienced the actual scourge of
war: may the sweet return of peace ex∣empt
her from participating in the almost
general calamity.</P>
<P>On the appearance of the British fleet
in the Chesapeak, the loyalists throughout
<PB N="438" REF="486"/>
that province were obliged to retire to a
remote distance from navigable waters.
There is certainly reason to credit this re∣port,
as I have only heard of two gentle∣men
who have eluded the vigilance of the
ruling powers, and joined the royal army
in their passage up the bay.</P>
<P><DATE>1st October.</DATE></P>
<P>The Thames is sailed for the Chesapeak.
I have been dissuaded from accompanying
Captain H—and my friends on board
that ship, by the earnest advice of Mr. C—
who justly observed, “that as our troops
had not made any descent on the west∣ern
shore of Maryland, I could not ren∣der
any essential service to myself, or
others, by an excursion thither.” But
another reason more forcibly operates to
detain me in my present situation—the
constant anxiety I experience to obtain in∣telligence
<PB N="439" REF="487"/>
relative to the welfare of my
dearest wife and son.</P>
<P><DATE>8th October.</DATE></P>
<P>On Saturday last arrived the packet.
Your letters, which informed me that
you were well and happy, relieved my
mind from a most painful and tedious state
of disquietude.</P>
<P>On the same day an expedition took place
under the command of Sir Henry Clinton,
and commodore Hotham. Their destina∣tion
was up the North River; and this in∣stant
we have received the particulars of
their operations. Fort Montgomery, and
Fort Clinton, have been taken by storm;
and in the capture of these places, it was
doubtful whether bravery or humanity was
most predominant.</P>
<P>Count Gabrouski, a young Polish no∣bleman,
who arrived in the late fleet from
<PB N="440" REF="488"/>
England, served as a volunteer in this ex∣pedition;
and in those ranks, where every
individual displayed the utmost heroism,
his distinguished coolness and intrepidity,
attracted universal admiration. In rushing
forward to the enemy's works, against a
heavy and well directed fire, he received
many wounds, and fell at the foot of their
intrenchments. His death was not im∣mediate;
—he lived to rejoice in victory!
The undaunted deportment of the British
grenadiers excited his applause, even in the
moment of dissolution. He spoke with
rapture of that enthusiastic ardour which
animated the whole as one body; and he
desired that his remains might be depo∣sited
on the memorable spot, where his
gallant associates had gained such honor.
It is said, he entreated Lord Rawdon, in
a very handsome compliment, to wear
that sword which he had so recently drawn
in support of the claims of Britain; and
<PB N="441" REF="489"/>
then paid the inevitable debt, with that
intrepidity of spirit which determined his
conduct, and led him forward to his fate.</P>
<P>It is expected the success which has at∣tended
this expedition, will greatly facili∣tate
the operations of General Burgoyne,
who, after having surmounted infinite dan∣gers
and difficulties, has certainly advanced
into the neighbourhood of Albany.</P>
<P>Such variety of contradictory reports are
daily circulated relative to the real situation
of the army under his command, that at
present all is mere conjecture, without
any certain ground on which to erect hope,
or admit despondency. There are those
who conceive, that General Howe ought
to have conducted his first efforts, to
complete a junction with the northern ar∣my;
and then to have directed the united
force of the British arms, wherever their
<PB N="442" REF="490"/>
exertions would have been most effectual.
But without due information of those im∣portant
facts, that influence the proceed∣ings
of our commanders, it is illiberal and
ungenerous, to censure or condemn. The
best concerted plans are frequently defec∣tive
in execution; and the seeming hand
of chance often leads to success the most
brilliant and decisive.</P>
<P><DATE>1st November.</DATE></P>
<P>At length <HI>suspense</HI> is determined by <HI>cer∣tainty.</HI>
I am preparing for my immediate
—perhaps final—departure from America.
The unfavourable aspect of public affairs
compels me to this necessary measure; and
I must, in consequence, encounter the in∣conveniences
of a winter's passage. But the
predominant idea of being speedily restored
to the society of a beloved wife and son,
will smooth the rugged billows, and dis∣sipate
<PB N="443" REF="491"/>
every apprehension of difficulty or
danger.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne has been necessitated
to surrender himself with his army. The
particulars of this unhappy, unexpected
event, are not yet public; but it is strongly
asserted, that the want of provisions, and
not the amazing superiority of the enemy,
obliged our gallant general to submit to
the inevitable fate of war.</P>
<P>An universal dejection has followed:
every loyal countenance bears the most
evident impressions of sorrow and disap∣pointment.
The exaltation of our adver∣saries
is doubtless in full proportion to
our mortification: for certainly this im∣portant
success will animate their efforts
in the prosecution of the war; give credit
and strength to their political negotiations,
and render dubious the event of a contest,
<PB N="444" REF="492"/>
which appeared rapidly approaching to a
desirable issue.</P>
<P>The duty which fell to the share of Ge∣neral
Burgoyne, was infinitely more ha∣zardous
than the allotment of our other
commanders; and, I am sorry to observe, it
is the prevailing opinion, that there has been
some neglect in the proper arrangements
necessary to have secured success. But
leaving these matters which are too high
for me, and enter not within my limited
sphere of action, I shall confine my obser∣vations
to domestic concernments.</P>
<P>A fleet is expected to sail from this place
for Cork in about fourteen days, in which
I have taken my passage on board a conve∣nient
vessel. An officer, and his lady,
with whom I am intimately acquainted,
bear me company in the voyage; so that
before the conclusion of the year, I
trust we shall be re-united. May we
<PB N="445" REF="493"/>
never again experience the anxiety and sor∣row
of separation.</P>
<P>My worthy friend, under whose hos∣pitable
roof I have experienced every en∣gaging
mark of disinterested attachment,
is determined, if possible, to increase my
sense of the obligations I am under to
him. Though comparative plenty abounds
in this garrison, yet almost every needful
article bears so exorbitant a price, that
in the present reduced state of my finan∣ces,
my proportion of stores for the pas∣sage
to Europe, would require a greater
expenditure than I am well able to support.
Mr. C—has, therefore, generously in∣sisted
on supplying me with every requi∣site;
so that unless our voyage should be
uncommonly tedious, I shall be enabled,
by his bounty, to fare sumptuously every
day. Perhaps, within the extensive cir∣cuit
of the British dominions, there is not
<PB N="446" REF="494"/>
a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haracter more universally beloved, or
respected, than the exalted man to whom
I am so deeply indebted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This worthy personage was suddenly translated to a better state on the 27th of November, 1778. At that aweful moment he was surrounded by some valued friends, and the instant before his dissolution, he ap∣peared in the full possession of health and chearfulness. The author, on receiving intelligence of this fatal event, addressed the following letter to the Editor of the Morn∣ing Chronicle, which was inserted in that paper, Fe∣bruary 11, 1779.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“SIR,”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“Through the channel of your extensive and im∣partial paper, permit me to offer a just tribute to the memory of an invaluable man, whose death will long be pathetically lamented, and whose innumerable virtues endeared him, even in the midst of hostile commotions, to the love and veneration of contending parties.”</P>
<P>“Daniel Chamier, Es{que} late Auditor General to the British army in America, resided many years in the province of Maryland, and in the discharge of various important offices, was particularly distinguished as a faithful servant to the public, and a valuable member of society.”</P>
<P>“On his quitting that government, to act in an ho∣nourable department in the service of the Crown, even the leaders in the present controversy spoke of him in terms of the highest veneration: they were a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sured, that the uncommon benevolence of his disposition would ex∣tend to every person, independent of political tenets, who might be reduced by the vicissitudes of war, to im∣plore his generous assistance.”</P>
<P>“When hostilities unhappily commenced between the parent state and her misguided colonies, this great! this worthy man! then exerted himself in a more ex∣alted sphere! The loyalist, who abandoned his family and property, compelled by the rigid hand of persecution, and who preferred his integrity to every inducement of avarice or ambition, found in him a sympathizing bene∣factor, by whom he was hospitably received, his necessi∣ties amply supplied, and every relief extended that his fortune or influence could possibly afford.”</P>
<P>“The prisoner experienced no less the effects of his unlimited compassion: amongst those who were cap∣tured by the incidents of war, many were the husbands, the sons, and friends of them with whom he had been formerly connected. By his interest he procured them particular indulgences; he advanced considerable sums for their immediate occasions, and exerted every effort to alleviate the idea of captivity, and render them com∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table in their peculiar situations. In a word, the ut∣most hospitality marked the whole of his conduct, and the innate goodness of his heart beamed forth in every action.”</P>
<P>“Such was the man for whom the prayers of multi∣tudes were fervently offered; but, alas! the will of heaven suddenly removed him from this terrestrial state, to receive an eternal recompense for his faithful dis∣charge of every relative duty.”</P>
<P>“To enter fully into the character of this very ex∣cellent person, would greatly exceed my abilities, and lead me into a field of prolixity. Suffice it to say, that in him his sovereign has lost a most loyal animated sub∣ject; his country an invaluable citizen; his wife a ten∣der indulgent husband; and the writer of this letter (with numbers who have felt the miseries of this un∣natural contention) has lost the most faithful affectionate friend! the most generous humane benefactor!”</P>

<P>It is adviseable to guard against every
possible accident. Our ship may be sepa∣rated
<PB N="447" REF="495"/>
from the convoy, and we may fall
into the enemies hands; as in that case
we shall probably be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etained in some

I shall proceed directly to Bristol; which
will be less expensive than by way of Dub∣lin;
and by which means I may be enabled
to pay a melancholy visit to the monument
of my once much beloved Powell! I shall
also have the satisfaction to renew a per∣sonal

<P>THANKS to Almighty God I am
safely arrived at my desired port,
after a pleasant and expeditious passage.</P>
<P>On the 15th of November I took an
affectionate leave of our generous hospi∣table
friends; on the 18th we quitted the
coast; on the 13th instant we struck sound∣ings;
and yesterday, in the evening, land∣ed
at a village named Passage; took post
horses, and were set down in this city in
time to procure a good supper, and conve∣nient
lodging.</P>
<P>The hurry and bustle of this place bears
some resemblance to our great metropolis.
The streets are crowded with busy multi∣tudes;
many of the shops have a hand∣some
<PB N="451" REF="499"/>
appearance; and the habitations of
the principal merchants, sufficiently indi∣cate
their wealth and commercial import∣ance.
The incredible quantities of provi∣sions,
which are preparing for exportation,
cannot but excite the highest ideas of the
trade and consequence of this flourishing
port. The variety of canals, bridges, and
wharfs, are likewise deserving of admiration.
By their canals, ships of considerable bur∣den
are laden at the merchant's doors;
and the wharfs, which are convenient and
extensive, are covered with innumerable
commodities, principally for the supply of
the army and navy in America.</P>
<P>By my friend Mr. C—, I was fa∣voured
with a letter of introduction to Mr.
B—, a merchant of great respectability
in this port; from whom I have received
a frank and general invitation to his table,
<PB N="452" REF="500"/>
during the time that inclination or ne∣cessity
may detain me in this city.</P>
<P>There are few persons in whom the pas∣sion
of curiosity is more predominant than
in myself; and the environs of Cork pro∣mise
abundant gratification to an inquisi∣tive
mind; but as the first object of my
pursuit relates to you, and to our dearest
boy, I have no wish for an opportunity to
make any excursion, foreign to the thoughts
that engross my mind in my present situa∣tion.</P>
<P>Passage, <DATE>Dec. 25.</DATE></P>
<P>Yesterday I took leave of Cork, and
came to this place in order to embark for
Bristol. About noon we expect to sail.</P>
<P>I shall quit Ireland with deep impres∣sions
of gratitude. The entertainment I
have experienced, greatly exceeds the high
ideas I had been taught to form of Irish hos∣pitality.
May they continue to enjoy every
<PB N="453" REF="501"/>
blessing which liberty, industry, and pros∣perity
can afford.</P>
<P>I shall leave this to be forwarded by
the post. Should a favourable gale crown
my wishes, it is possible—nay, proba∣ble
—that I may be happily re-united to
my dearest partner, before she will receive
this servent assurance of my unalterable
attachment. The hour—the long ex∣pected
hour—is at hand, which will re∣store

<P>I emba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked at Passage on Christmas∣day,
but the wind would not permit us to

then became contrary, and we were happy

<P>The distance from this place to Bristol is
reckoned twenty-five leagues; but on ac∣count

<P>When you receive your husband to your
faithful arms, let every anxious idea be
excluded—let us unite in recounting past
deliverances, and be thus animated to look
forward with gratitude and confidence. Our
disappointments and our misfortunes have
originated from inevitable causes; and if
adversity should still continue to oppose
our best endeavours, we must derive con∣solation
from reflecting that we have acted
consistent with the sentiments which we
professed, and with a conscientious regard
to the duties of that station in which Pro∣vidence
had placed us, always remember∣ing
that though
