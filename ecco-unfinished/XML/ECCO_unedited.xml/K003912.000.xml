<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Very much fear I shall be thought guilty of great Presumption in taking the Liberty to dedicate, to Your Excellency, a Play represen∣ted at this Season of the Year; and, at the same time, in doing it without first ob∣taining Leave: But as Your Excellency has too just a Taste and Knowledge of every Science to pass Judgment on any Writer, otherwise than as You are influenc'd
<PB REF="3"/>
by the real Merit of his Performance, the first Objection will be of little avail against me; for I should have the same Dread, at any other time, of not gaining Your Ex∣cellency's Approbation, since I am sensi∣ble, I have but small Pretentions to it from the Alterations and Additions I have made in the Piece I do my self the Honour to lay at Your Excellency's Feet.</P>
<P>The other Objection, of not begging Your Excellency's Permission for this Ad∣dress, is of no greater Force than the for∣mer; for tho' very few Gentlemen of high Birth and Station so much deserve the Encomiums of Mankind as Your Ex∣cellency, yet, I am told, there are still fewer but seem more delighted with them. Then how could I apply to Your Excel∣lency in an Affair of this kind, which is, in my Opinion, no better than a Bargain between the Patron and Poet for such a Number of Flatteries and overstrain'd Compliments, as Your Excellency would scorn to accept had I Meanness enough to make an Offering of them?</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>But to take this Occasion of congratu∣lating my native Country, <HI>Ireland</HI>, on the Happiness it is going to receive from Your wise and prudent Administration, and of being one of the foremost in shewing my Zeal and Duty to Your Excellency, I hope will not be thought an unpardonable Am∣bition in,</P>

<L>Sworn Foe to Vice, by Virtue's Friends rever'd;</L>
<L>Impartial she indulg'd her noble Rage,</L>
<L>And Satire was the Business of the Stage:</L>
<L>No reigning Ill was from her Censure free,</L>
<L>No Sex, no Age of Man, and no Degree;</L>
<L>Whoe'er by Passion was, or Folly, led,</L>
<L>The laurel'd Chief, or sacerdotal Head,</L>

<L>When saucy Poets wou'd chastise their Crimes!</L>
<L>When each cornuting Mate, each rampant Jilt,</L>

<L>Each Fair may now the Comic Muse endure,</L>

<L>A wilful, headstrong, Termagant and Scold;</L>
<L>Whom, tho' her Husband did what Man cou'd do,</L>

Oh Heaven! I dream! Yet if this be a Dream, I would not wish to wake again. Sure, I died last Night, and went to Heaven, and this is it.</P>

<P>I have transform'd your Lady's Face so that she seems the Cobler's Wife, and have charm'd her Face into the Like∣ness of my Lady's; and last Night when the Storm arose, my Spirits convey'd them to each other's Bed.</P>
