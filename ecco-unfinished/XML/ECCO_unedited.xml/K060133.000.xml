for <HI>Extending</HI> and <HI>Improving</HI> our TRADE, and <HI>Promoting</HI>
the CONSUMPTION of our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> in Countries

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a Nation rais'd as we are by
Trade, fam'd for carrying on the
most extended Commerce in the
World, and particularly prospe∣rous
in the greatest Ʋnderta∣kings,
whether for Improvement at Home,
or Adventure Abroad, nothing is more
wonderful, than to see how ignorant the
Generality of our People are about it;
how weakly they talk of it, and how little
has been made publick for their better In∣formation.</P>
<P>Every Man knows his own Affairs, moves
in his own Circle, pursues the Mechanism
of his own particular Business; but take
him out of his Road, he knows nothing
of the Reason, or the End of what he is
about: The Clothier sorts his Wool, dyes
and mixes the Colours; the Comb, the Card,
the Wheel, the Loom, are all set on Work
by his Direction, and he is call'd a <HI>Master
of his Art,</HI> and he is so; but ask him where
<PB REF="3"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
his Cloths are sold, by whom bought, to what
Part of the World they are shipt, and who are
the last Consumers of them, he knows nothing
of the Matter; he sends them up to <HI>London</HI>
to the Factor that sells them, whether at
<HI>Blackwell-Hall,</HI> or in his private Ware∣house,
and when sold, he draws Bills for the
Money; there his Circle meets; the Money
buys more Wool to be sorted, and comb'd, and
spun; and so on, he ends just where he be∣gins,
and he begins just where he ended.
To talk to him of Trade, Ships, Ex∣portation;
Markets Abroad, and Returns
in Specie, or in Merchants Goods, tis
as much out of his Way, as the Race
and the Paddock is to a Carryer's Pack∣horse.</P>
<P>The Merchant on the other Hand
moves in another Sphere; and he being
a Man of Correspondence, besides his
own Adventure, receives Commissions from
Abroad to buy such and such Goods, and
good Remittances by Bills to pay for them,
then he ships them according to Order,
sends his Invoyces and Bills of Loading by
the Post; and there's his Circle finish'd. As
to the Wool which is the Principal of the
Manufacture; as to the many Hands it goes
thro'; how many Thousand Families are
employed by it; how the Poor are subsisted,
the Provisions consum'd, the landed In∣terest
rais'd, the Nobility and Gentry
enrich'd, and the whole Nation supported
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
by the very Goods he buys; he neither
knows or concerns himself about it.</P>
<P>The Captains, Masters, Owners, and
Navigators of Ships, they move in another
Orb, but still act in the same Round of
Business; the Ship is built, and fitted out
for a Voyage; Thousands of Tradesmen and
Workmen subsist upon the petty Demands
of the Captain or other Persons who direct the
Voyage; the Timber, the Plank, the Iron-Work,
the Masts, the Rigging, the Tar
and Hemp, the Flax and Oyl, all pass
thro' different and numberless Hands, till
they center in the Builder's Yard; there
the Frame of a Vessel is set on the Stocks.
What Hands are then employ'd to creat the
beautiful useful Form of a Ship! and
what Art to perfect and launch her into the
Water!</P>
<P>The Carpenters, Caulkers, Mastmakers,
Joyners, Carvers, Painters, Smiths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
finish the Hull; the Tradesmen are employ'd
to furnish and fit her out; the Sail-Ma∣kers,
the Rope-Makers, Anchor-Smiths,
Block- Makers, Guu-Founders, Coopers, and
(for a Thousand small Things too trifling to
mention, tho' absolutely needful) the Ship
Chandler, and at last the Brewer, Butcher,
Baker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Provision to victual her,
all help on the Voyage.</P>
<P>All these supported by that glorious Head
of Commerce, called the <HI>Merchant,</HI> are em∣ployed
in the Outset of the Ship, but know
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
nothing how to manage the Ship in the Ocean,
how to cause her to find her Way on the wild
and pathless Surface of the Water; they fit
her out, and deliver all to the Commander,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as to the sailing Part, that belongs
to another Class of People, called the Sailers
or Navigators; and when the Tradesmen
have put the Ship into their Hands, their
Work is done, till the Ship returns, and then
they begin all again: So the Circle is conti∣nued,
for ever the same.</P>
<P>Again, the Navigator or Commander, he
puts up his Ship on the Exchange for such a
Voyage, <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> or <HI>Hamburg,</HI> or
<HI>Leghorn;</HI> he takes in the Merchants
Goods, carries them safe to the delivering
Port; he reloads there, and brings back
his Cargoe; he knows no more; even his
<HI>Bills of Loading</HI> are sign'd, under a needful
Profession of his Ignorance, naming the Bulk
of what he receives on Board (so many
Hogsheads, or Butts, or Bales) but adds
<HI>the Contents unknown, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When he brings home the Ship, he makes
his Report at the Custom-house, and un∣livers
his Cargo, as they call it; then he
receives his Freight, pays his Men, and
lays the Ship up, and there's his Circle fi∣nish'd;
his Sphere of Action, however im∣portant;
reaches no farther; as to Trade
or Commerce, whether general or parti∣cular,
he knows no more of it than just
lies before him.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
I might run thro' almost all the Branches
of Business, and all the Classes of the Men
of Business; and give Examples of the like;
but 'tis enough, the Conclusion is short:
Hence then a general or universal <HI>Plan of
Commerce</HI> is certainly much wanted in
the World.</P>
<P>When we speak of some Men, who are
the most acquainted in the World of Busi∣ness,
we say they are Men of a general
Knowledge; and such a Man is an univer∣sal
Merchant; I have indeed heard such
Language talked among the trading Part of
Mankind, but I cannot say that I ever saw
the Man.</P>
<P>The Commerce of the World, especially
as it is now carried on, is an unbounded
Ocean of Business; Trackless and unknown,
like the Seas it is managed upon; the Mer∣chant
is no more to be follow'd in his Adven∣tures,
than a Maze or Labyrinth is to be
trac'd out without a Clue.</P>
<P>The Author of this Work is not quite
so arrogant, after a Complaint of this Na∣ture,
as to tell you he shall present you with
this universal Plan, for the whole Trade
of the World: It is enough, if he is able to
offer a Plan for the Trade of our own
Country, in which it is but too true, there
are many that talk of the general Com∣merce
to one that understands it.</P>
<P>Nor even in this Plan of our Commerce,
does he direct what the Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
in general is with us; but what and how great
our particular Commerce is; how it is ar∣riv'd
to its present Magnitude; how to
be maintained and supported in its full Ex∣tent;
(and which is, or ought to be, the
true End of all such Attempts:) How it
may yet be improv' d and enlarg'd.</P>
<P>We have loud Complaints among us of
the Decay of our Trade, the declining of
our Manufactures, and especially of our
woollen Manufacture, the contrary of which
is, I think, evidently prov'd in this Tract,
and the Reasons given for it, will not be
easily refuted. It is not any little Nega∣tive
put upon our Manufactures, as to their
Consumption in this or that petty Province
or Country in <HI>Germany,</HI> or else where:
Our Manufacture, like a flowing Tide, if
'tis bank't out in one Place, it spreads by
other Channels at the same Time into so many
different Parrs of the World, and finds
every Day so many new Outlets, that the
Obstruction is not felt; but like the Land
to the Sea, what it loses in one Place, it
gains in another.</P>
<P>It is plain, the Manufacture cannot be de∣clin'd,
if the Quantity of Wool is wrought
up, and the Goods are consum'd; on the other
Hand 'tis evident, the Consumption of our
Manufactures, both abroad and at home, is
exceedingly encreas'd; the first by the En∣crease
of our Correspondencies, and the last by
the Encrease of our People; and that to such
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
a Degree, as infinitely out-weighs all that
can be pretended of the Prohibitions of
them in <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Imitations of
them in <HI>France;</HI> nor are those things able to
wound us so deep as our phlegmatick Com∣plainers
would insinuate.</P>
<P>But that a full Answer may be given
to all they can say of what Loss we yet suf∣fer,
and to all they can suggest of what
we may suffer hereafter; this Work is cal∣culated,
to shew how we may counteract
it all at once: Namely, by improving and
encreasing our Trade in other Places where
those Prohibitions and Imitations cannot
reach, and where, if half <HI>Europe</HI> should
drop our Manufacture, which yet 'tis ap∣parent
can never happen, we shall raise
an equivalent Vent for our Goods, and
make Markets of our own; in which the
whole World could not supplant us, unless
they could subdue us.</P>
<P>This is the Substance of this Tract;
'tis the original Thought which gave Birth
to the whole Work; if our Trade is the
Envy of the World, and they are conspi∣ring
to break in upon it, either to anti∣cipate
it, or block it out, we are the more
engaged to look out for its Support; and
we have Room enough: The World is wide:
There are new Countries, and new Nati∣ons,
who may be so planted, so improv'd,
and the People so manag'd, as to create a
new Commerce; and Millions of People
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
shall call for our Manufacture, who ne∣ver
call'd for it before.</P>
<P>Nothing is to me more evident, than that
the civilizing the Nations where we and
other <HI>Europeans</HI> are already settled; bring∣ing
the naked Savages to Clothe, and in∣structing
barbarous Nations how to live,
has had a visible Effect already, in this
very Article. Those Nations call upon us
every Year for more Goods, than they did
the Year before, as well woollen Manu∣factures,
as others. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> Colo∣nies
in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> and on the East Coasts
of <HI>Africa,</HI> are an unanswerable Proof of
this. The <HI>European</HI> Manufactures now
sent to those Colonies, are above five Times
as many as were sent to the same Places,
about 30 to 40 Years ago; and yet the
<HI>European</HI> Inhabitants in those Colonies are
not encreased in Proportion. We might
give Instances of the like in other Places
abroad, and that not a few.</P>
<P>New planting Colonies then, and farther
improving those already settled, will effec∣tually
encrease this Improvement; for like
Causes, will have like Effects; Clothing
new Nations cannot fail of encreasing the
Demand of Goods, because it encreases the
Consumption, and that encreased Demand
is the Prosperity of our Trade.</P>
<P>Here then is an undiscover'd Ocean of
Commerce laid open to us, and same Spe∣cimens
are offer'd, which if entred upon,
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
with the Authority, Power, and Vigor of
the Publick, would open such new Chan∣nels
of Trade among us, as it would be
very hard for our Manufacturers to over∣stock
the Market, and as no petty Prohi∣bitions
in Europe could stop the Current of.</P>
<P>It is surprizing that in a Nation where
such Encouragements are given for planting
and improving, where Colonies have been
settled, and Plantations made with such
Success; where we may truly be said to
have filled the World with the Wonders of
our growing Possessions, and where we have
added not Provinces only, but Kingdoms to
the <HI>British</HI> Dominion, and have launched
out even to an Ocean of Commerce. That
now, I say, We should, as it were, put a
full Stop at once to all our great Designs;
check the Humour of Encreasing, and from
a kind of a mysterious unaccountable Stupi∣dity
turn indolent on a suddain. Not as if
we found no were Room to launch out, for
the Contrary to that is apparent; but as
if we had enough, and sought no more
Worlds in Trade to conquer.</P>
<P>In all other Cases, and among all other
Nations Success encourages Men to go on;
encreasing, they endeavour to encrease, <HI>Cres∣cit
amor nummi,</HI> &amp;c.—So in Trade, the
growing and enlarging the Bounds of a Plan∣tation,
the swelling and thriving of Com∣merce,
and the Advantages to the Mer∣chant
and Planter in all those Things, cer∣tainly
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
encreases the Desire of planting, en∣larges
the Commerce and fires the Mer∣chant
with the Desires of enlarging his Ad∣ventures,
searching out new Colonies, form∣ing
new Adventures, and pushing at new
Discoveries for the Encrease of his Trad∣ing
Advantages.</P>
<P>It is so in other Nations, and it seems
wonderful it should not be so here; the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> tho' an indolent Nation, whose
Colonies were really so rich, so great,
and so far extended, as were enough even
to glut their utmost Avarice; yet gave not
over, till, as it were, they sat still, because
they had no more Worlds to look for; or till
at least, there were no more Gold or Sil∣ver
Mines to discover</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> tho' an effeminate, haugh∣ty,
and as it were, a decay'd Nation in
Trade; yet how do they go on Daily encrea∣sing
their Colonies in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI>
as well on the East Side, as the West? And
how do they encrease their Commerce in all
those Countries, by reducing the numerous
Natious in <HI>Melinda,</HI> in <HI>Zanguebar,</HI> in <HI>Con∣go,</HI>
in <HI>Angola,</HI> in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> as well North
as South, and every where else, to the
Christian Oeconomy, and to the Government
of Commerce! by which they subdue whole
Nations of Savages to a regular Life, and
by that Means bring them to be subservient
to Trade as well as to Government.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
But how little have we done of this kind?
How little have we gain'd upon the Na∣tives
of <HI>America</HI> in all our Colonies? How
few of them are brought to live among us,
how few to be subject to us? How little
Progress of that kind can we boast of? All
our Colonies seem to be carried on upon the
meer Strength of our own People. Nor can
we say we have any one considerable Nation
reduced to entire Obedience and brought to
live under the Regularity and Direction of a
Civil Government, in all our Plantations;
a few (very few) in <HI>New England</HI> only
excepted.</P>
<P>As for new Colonies and Conquests, how
do we seem entirely to give over, even the
Thoughts of them, tho' the Scene is so large,
tho' the Variety is so great, and the Ad∣vantages
so many? On the Contrary, we
seem to forget the glorious Improvements of
our Ancestors, such as the great <HI>Drake, Ca∣vendish,
Smith, Greenfield, Somers,</HI> and a∣bove
all, the yet greater Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI>
upon the Foot of whose Genius almost all the
<HI>English</HI> Discoveries were made, and all the
Colonies and Plantations, which now form
what they call the <HI>English Empire</HI> in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>
were settled and established. These I
say we seem to sit down with, as if we
had done our utmost, were fully satisfied
with what we have, that the enterpri∣sing
Genius was buried with the old Dis∣coverers,
and there was neither Room in the
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
World or Inclination in our People to look
any farther.</P>
<P>Whereas on the Contrary, the World pre∣sents
us with large Scenes of Trade, new
Platforms for Business, enough to prompt
our Ambition, and even to glut our Ava∣rice;
yet we seem to have no Heart for the
Adventure.</P>
<P>Nor is there any want of People among
us; on the contrary, here are Thousands of
Families who want Business, want Employ∣ment,
want Encouragement, and many that
want no Stocks to carry with them, and are
ready to go abroad, were the adventuring
Spirit reviv'd, and some Men fired with
Warmth for the Ʋndertaking, and but vi∣gorous
enough to make the Beginning.</P>
<P>This is the Way to raise new Worlds of
Commerce, to enlarge and extend new Funds
of Trade, to open Doors for an Encrease
of Shipping and Manufacture; the Places
are so many and the Advantages so great
for the making such Attempts; that I say
nothing is more wonderful of its kind,
than to see how backward we are to push
on our own Advantages, and to plant in
the most agreeable Climates in the World,
in a manner so advantageous as never to
be supplanted, and such as should make
the <HI>English</HI> Possessions abroad five Times as
Great, as Opulent and as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Profitable to Old
<HI>England,</HI> as they have been yet.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
The Description of these Places, so pro∣per
for Planting, so suited to Commerce,
and so qualified to enrich and aggran∣dize
the <HI>British</HI> Nation, is a Work not only
too large for this Tract, but seems not suited
to our present Tast; it must lye till the
Trading Genius revives and the adventur∣ing
Temper is restored among us: Then it
will appear; there will neither want En∣couragment
to such Ʋndertakings or Ʋnder∣takers
to embrace the Encouragements which
offer.</P>
<P>As these are Things of the utmost Im∣portance
to our Trade in general, and in
that to the Prosperity of all his Majesty's
Dominions in particular, the Author hum∣bly
hopes it shall not be thought assuming,
that as we say in our Title, they are hum∣bly
referr'd to the Consideration of the
King and Parliament; they are Things
worthy of a King, and worthy of a power∣ful
Legislature to consider of; no Power
less than that of King; Lords and Com∣mons,
can put these Wheels of Improvement
into due Motion: And I conclude with
an inexpressible Satisfaction, in saying, that
as we know his Majesty has the Prospe∣rity
of all his Kingdoms at Heart, and will
be always ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to reasonable and
practicable Proposals for that Purpose;
and that the Parliament has always shewn
their Readiness to concur in the same just
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
Endeavour; and which is yet more, that
the Proposals here offered, and others yet
behind, are apparently practicable and ra∣tional;
it cannot be doubted, but that the
Time will come, and is near at Hand,
when the Improvement of the <HI>British</HI> Com∣merce
shall no more appear in Project and
Theory, but shew it self in a due and
daily Progression, till it compleats the Glo∣ry
and Prosperity of the whole Nation.</P>

GENERAL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>RADE, like Religion, is
what every Body talks of,
but few understand: The ve∣ry
Term is dubious, and in
its ordinary Acceptation, not
sufficiently explain'd.</P>
<P>WHEN 'tis particular to a Place, 'tis
<HI>Trade;</HI> when general, 'tis <HI>Commerce;</HI>
when we speak of it as the Effect of Na∣ture,
'tis <HI>Product</HI> or Produce; when as
the Effect of Labour, 'tis <HI>Manufacture:</HI> In
its Management 'tis the same, for when we
<PB N="2" REF="30"/>
speak of it in the gross, 'tis <HI>wholesale;</HI>
when of the particulars, 'tis <HI>retale;</HI> when
we speak of Nations, 'tis call'd <HI>Correspond∣ing;</HI>
when of foreign Import only, 'tis cal∣led
<HI>Merchandizing;</HI> 'Tis the same also in
the Manner, when we exchange Goods 'tis
call'd <HI>Barter;</HI> when we exchange Coin,
'tis call'd <HI>Banking, Negoce</HI> and <HI>Nego∣tiating;</HI>
Hence, our Money - Goldsmiths
were formerly called <HI>Bankers,</HI> and our great
national Treasury of Commerce is at this
Day called the <HI>Bank.</HI></P>
<P>THE general heads of Home-Trade are best
contain'd in the <HI>two</HI> plain and homely Terms
<HI>Labouring,</HI> and <HI>Dealing.</HI> 1st. <HI>The labouring
Part,</HI> this consists of Arts, Handicrafts, and
all Kinds of Manufactures; and those who
are employ'd in these Works, are properly
called <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> they are employ'd, gene∣rally
speaking, about the first Principles of
Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Product of the <HI>Land</HI> or
of the <HI>Sea,</HI> or of the Animals living on
both: In a Word, the ordinary Produce of
the <HI>vegetative</HI> and <HI>sensative Life;</HI> such as
Metals, Minerals and Plants, the imme∣diate
Produce of <HI>Vegetation,</HI> or such as
Flesh, Skins, Hair, Wool, Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> grown
with, and produc'd by the Animals, as the
Effect of <HI>sensitive Life.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The Dealing Part;</HI> this consists of hand∣ing
about all the several Productions of Art
and Labour, when finish'd by the Hand
of the industrious Mechanick, and made
<PB N="3" REF="31"/>
useful to Mankind; conveying them from
Place to Place, and from one Country to
another, as the Necessity and the Conve∣nience
of the People call for them; and
that upon such Terms and Conditions of
Delivery, as they can best agree about a∣mong
themselves, and this is Trade; whe∣ther
it be carry'd on by the general Medium
of all Exchangings call'd Coin, or by some∣thing
substituted as Coin, and in the room
of it, which we call Money.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> ANY Thing that is by the Autho∣rity
of a Nation establish'd as the Me∣dium
of their Exchanges, is properly
the MONEY of the Nation, tho' seldom
any Thing but Gold, Silver, or other
Metals is call'd COIN.</P>
<P>THUS Dealing and Manufacturing com∣prehends
all Trade; that is to say, in its
meer natural and original Situation; and
all the subsequent Divisions and Distincti∣ons
of Terms, by which we are taught to
express the particular Parts of Trade, are
but modern Names introduc'd by Custom,
and legitimated by length of Time, and
general Usage of the Men of Art, to di∣stinguish
Things, as accident and the Va∣riety
of the several Productions in Mecha∣nism
required.</P>
<P>SO the Word GOODS is a general Term,
comprehending all the several Kinds and
Sorts, whether of Manufactures or Pro∣duct,
that the greatest Dealer in the World
<PB N="4" REF="32"/>
can be supposed to Trade in; it is a usu∣al
Thing to express it so to this Day, in
the Language of Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI> in
<HI>retailing,</HI> we say, such a Shop is well fur∣nish'd
with all Sorts of GOODS: In <HI>whole∣sale</HI>
Trade, such a Dealer has his Ware∣house
well fill'd with GOODS; In <HI>House∣keeping,</HI>
all the Furniture of a House are
called the GOODS, or the <HI>Houshold-goods:</HI> In
<HI>Merchandizing,</HI> such a Ship was Loaden
with BALE GOODS; and in the <HI>East India</HI>
Ships, after the <HI>bulky Goods,</HI> (so they call
the Pepper, Salt-petre, Red-earth, Tea,
and such like) are taken out, it is said the
rest of the Loading was made up with
PIECE GOODS.</P>
<P>AS the Terms in Trade are various, so
the People concern'd in Trade bear differing
Titles, and are ordinarily known by differ∣ing
Denominations.</P>
<P>THOSE concern'd in the meaner and first
Employments, are called in common, Work∣ing
Men or Labourers, and the <HI>labouring
Poor;</HI> such as the meer Husbandmen, Mi∣ners,
Diggers, Fishers, and in short, all
the Drudges and Labourers in the several
Productions of Nature or of Art: <HI>Next
to them,</HI> are those who, tho' labouring per∣haps
equally with the other, have yet some
Art mingled with their Industry, and are
to be particularly instructed and taught
how to perform their Part, and those are
called Workmen or Handicrafts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="33"/>
SUPERIOR to these, are the Guides or Mas∣ters
in such Works or Employments, and
these are call'd Artists, Mechanicks or Crafts∣men;
and in general, all are understood in
this one Word Mechanicks; such are Clo∣thiers,
Weavers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Handicrafts in Hard∣ware,
Brass, Iron, Steel, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SUPERIOR to these are the Dealers who
only buy and sell, either by wholesale or
retale as above; these are the Factor, the
Pedlar, and the Merchant.</P>
<P>ALL these come under the general Deno∣mination
of Trading Men, and they are the
principal Kinds or Professions which <HI>just
now</HI> carry on the Trade of the World.</P>
<P>HAVING thus, once for all, accounted for
these several Distinctions, and for the tra∣ding
People in their respective Denomina∣tions
as above, we shall have no more Oc∣casion
to explain the Terms as we go a∣long,
or trouble the Reader witli running
out to enquire our Meaning, when we
speak of the several Branches of <HI>Commerce</HI>
in their proper and particular Distinctions
or Terms of Art.</P>
<P>WE must also remove some Scandal out
of the Way as we go on, and this is ano∣ther
Difficulty. This Scandal relates to the
Dignity, Antiquity, and other Honours
due to Trade, and claim'd in its Behalf;
concerning which we meet with much
weak headed Strife in the World; and
which, as I take it, belongs properly to
<PB N="6" REF="34"/>
this Place, at least I shall discharge my self
of it here, and by doing so, shall have no
more Occasion to trouble you with it in the
rest of our Debate, however, the imper∣tinent
Cavils of the Times may importune
me upon that Head.</P>
<P>PRIDE, in Conjunction with abundance
of Ignorance, is frequently in Arms against
the peaceable trading World about Pre∣cedence,
and in a Plea of Antiquity: They
would divide the World into two Parts
only, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Gentry and the Commo∣nalty;
among the Gentry they rank the
Nobility, the ancient Families of Gentle∣men,
(as they call them) Barons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
those who were formerly called Barons;
and with some Difficulty they admit the
Men of Learning, and the Men of Arms,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Soldiery and the Clergy, and
all the Families, who by the Heraldry of
their Houses claim to have been Gentle∣men
unmix'd with plebeian Blood for im∣memorial
Ages.</P>
<P>THIS Family Jargon, <HI>for it is no more,</HI>
they oppose to the trading Part of the whole
World, whom they divest of all Dignity, as
well as of Degree; and blend together un∣der
one general, or rather common De∣nomination
of <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> tho' by the Acci∣dents
of Time, and Circumstances of Things,
some of them <HI>are,</HI> and for many Ages
<HI>have been</HI> true Members of the Gentry
by collateral Branches; nay sometimes by
<PB N="7" REF="35"/>
the chief Lines of the best and most an∣cient
Families in the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> OBSERVE, here I speak of our own
Country chiefly, and of the Mistake,
as it is particularly espoused in <HI>England,</HI>
and nowhere else.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to Antiquity; and <HI>even in
this,</HI> I think the Tradesmen and the Gentry
should never cap Pedigrees, since the most
noble Descendants of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family, and
in whom the Primogeniture remained, were
really <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> for honest JUBAL and
TUBAL were the first <HI>Fidle</HI>-makers and
<HI>Tinkers</HI> in the World: The first invented
and made musical Instruments, <HI>Fidles,</HI>
&amp;c. and the second was the first <HI>Hard-ware
Manufacturer,</HI> that is in <HI>English,</HI> a <HI>Tinker,</HI>
and no better; <HI>N. B.</HI> for long, (many long
Ages) after them, the Sons and Grandsons
of these Mechanicks were Kings and Princes,
Dukes and Lords.</P>
<P>AFTER the second Peopling of the
World, before there were any Distinctions
of Nobility, or Mechanicks, they seem
to have been all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Labourers; as at the
erecting that stupendous Work called <HI>Ba∣bel</HI>
for Example; to be sure, the FREE-Masons
and their Brother Bricklayers, who
were the Master-Builders there, were some
of the top of their Gentry at that Time.</P>
<P>AS the World encreased, SIDON, <HI>No∣ah</HI>'s
Grandson, built a City, which remains
<PB N="8" REF="36"/>
in the same Place, and bears the same
Name to this Day.</P>
<P>HERE Navigation began, and as <HI>Noah</HI>
was the first Shipwright, or according to
us, the first <HI>Ship-Carpenter,</HI> (a true Me∣chanick)
his Posterity built the first Boats,
and afterwards Ships at this Place; with
these they traded to and with the neigh∣bouring
Nations upon the Coast, as Nature,
Reason and Necessity guided them. In
the Infancy of their navigating Skill, they
Row'd along in these Boats, (for at first they
had no Sails) from Place to Place North∣ward,
to the Gulph of <HI>Alexandria</HI> now
<HI>Scandaroon,</HI> and so on to the Coast of <HI>Cilicia</HI>
where they built <HI>Tarshish,</HI> the first grand
<HI>Arsenal</HI> or Place for Ship-building in the
World; whence great Ships were after∣wards
called <HI>Ships of Tarshish</HI> for many
Ages, no Ships of Burthen being built any
where else.</P>
<P>ALSO South they coasted to <HI>Joppa,</HI> now
<HI>Jaffa,</HI> thence to <HI>Damiata</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI>
where their great Grandfather CHAM reign∣ed
Emperor of all <HI>Africa</HI> for many Ages.
See Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI>'s History of the
World.</P>
<P>ENCREASING thus in People, and in
Wealth (by Trade) and growing too great
for the Compass of one City, or the Com∣merce
of one Port, they spread themselves
by way of Colony, and settled first at
<HI>Tyre,</HI> a convenient Situation also for Ship∣ing
and for Merchandizing.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="37"/>
HERE they encreased again to such a Pro∣digy
of Business, as I have good Reason to
believe, was never equall'd in the World,
except just now, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by the great Trade
carry'd on at this Time in <HI>England;</HI> of
which in its Place.</P>
<P>AND here to prove to you beyond the
Power of Cavil, that the Antients thought
it not below their Quality to be Trades∣men;
the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> says, <HI>Thy wise
Men were thy Pilots, and thy Merchants
are Princes;</HI> or as some read it, <HI>Thy Prin∣ces
are Merchants,</HI> as it is expresly in ano∣ther
Place, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xxvii. 21. <HI>The Princes
of</HI> Kedar <HI>were thy Merchants.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much is sufficient for the Antiqui∣ty
of Trade and Navigation; as to the An∣tiquity
of trading Families, I say with a
late low born Poet, but a Man of Wit,
<Q>Let <HI>Caesar</HI> or <HI>Nassau</HI> go higher.</Q>
And why then are we to despise Commerce
as a Mechanism, and the Trading World
as mean, when the Wealth of the World is
deem'd to rise from Trade? as the same Text
said of <HI>Tyre,</HI> v. 33. of the same Chapter, <HI>Thou
didst enrich the Kings of the Earth with
thy Merchandise.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to bring this down to our selves;
Are we a rich, a populous, a powerful Na∣tion,
and in some Respects the greatest in
all those particulars in the World, and do
<PB N="10" REF="38"/>
we not boast of being so? 'Tis evident it
was all deriv'd from Trade. <HI>Our Merchants
are Princes,</HI> greater and richer, and more
powerful than some sovereign Princes; and
in a Word, as is said of <HI>Tyre,</HI> we have
<HI>made the Kings of the Earth rich with our
Merchandise,</HI> that is, with our Trade.</P>
<P>IF Usefulness gives an Addition to the
Character, either of Men or Things, as
without doubt it does; Trading-men will
have the Preference in almost all the Disputes
you can bring: There is not a Nation in
the known World, but have tasted the Be∣nefit,
and owe their Prosperity to the use∣ful
Improvements of Commerce: Even the
self-vain Gentry, that would decry Trade
as a universal Mechanism, are they not eve∣ry
where depending upon it for their most
necessary Supplies? If they do not all <HI>sell,</HI>
they are all forc'd to <HI>buy,</HI> and so are a kind of
Traders themselves, at least they recognize
the Usefulness of Commerce, as what they
are not able to live comfortably without.</P>
<P>NAY, in many Parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> they
are really Traders, both Buyers and Sellers;
<HI>for Example,</HI> where the Landlords are
obliged to take their Rents in kind, as the
Clergy do their Tithes; here they are (in
a word) general Traders; they sell their
Barley to the Malt-makers, their Wheat to
the Millers and Bakers, their Oates to the
Corn-factors, their Sheep and Bullocks are
sold at the Markets to the Butchers, or
<PB N="11" REF="39"/>
at Fairs to the Graziers; they are Sheep-Shearers,
and sell their Wool to the Stapler
or Clothier; and when they kill a Bullock,
or a Calf, or a Sheep, for their Family-Use,
they are beholding to the Felmonger,
and the Tanner, to buy the raw Hides
and Skins; when they sell their Timber,
they are oblig'd to turn Mechanicks, and
sell the Bark to the Tanners, the Timber
to the Ship-wright and the Carpenters, the
Brushwood and Bavins to the Baker and
the Brick-maker.</P>
<P>IN a Word, useful Trade supports the
Gentleman; and without these Mechanicks
he could not dispose the Produce of his
Estate, or make any Rent of his Land; and
rather than not dispose of it, such is his Ne∣cessity,
that we see he will stoop to buy and
sell for himself, and trade and deal like a
meer Mechanick.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all, if they would look a
little nearer, they would see themselves not
by Practice only degenerated into Trad∣ing
Men, but even their Fortunes, nay,
their very Blood mingled with the Mecha∣nicks,
<HI>as they call them;</HI> the Necessity of
their Circumstances frequently reconciles the
best of the Nobility to these Mixtures; and
then the same Necessity opens their Eyes
to the Absurdity of the Distinctions which
they had been so wedded to before.</P>
<P>IT is with the utmost Disgrace to their
Understanding, that those People would di∣stinguish
<PB N="12" REF="40"/>
themselves in the Manner they
do, when they may certainly see every Day
prosperous Circumstances advance those
Mechanicks, <HI>as they will have them cal∣led,</HI>
into the Arms, and into the Rank
of the Gentry; and declining Fortunes re∣duce
the best Families to a Level with the
Mechanick.</P>
<P>THE rising Tradesman swells into the
Gentry, and the declining Gentry sinks into
Trade. A Merchant, or perhaps a Man of
a meaner Employ thrives by his honest In∣dustry,
Frugality, and a long series of dili∣gent
Application to Business, and being
grown immensely rich, he marries his
Daughters to Gentlemen of the first Quality,
perhaps a Coronet; then he leaves the Bulk
of his Estate to his Heir, and he gets into
the Rank of the Peerage; does the next Age
make any Scruple of their Blood, being thus
mix'd with the antient Race? Do we not
just now see two Dukes descended by the
Female Side, from the late Sir <HI>Josiah
Child,</HI> and the immediate Heir a Peer of
<HI>Ireland?</HI> Many Examples of the like Kind
might be given.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the declining Gen∣try,
in the Ebb of their Fortunes, frequent∣ly
push their Sons into Trade, and they a∣gain,
by their Application, often restore the
Fortunes of their Families: Thus Trades∣men
become Gentlemen, by Gentlemen be∣coming
Tradesmen. I could give Exam∣ples
<PB N="13" REF="41"/>
of this too, but they are too recent for
our naming.</P>
<P>THEY that learn thus to despise Trad∣ing
People as such, must either be intirely
ignorant of the World, or perfectly un∣capable
of the just Impressions of these
Things; they must forget sure, that the
Gentry are always willing to submit to the
raising their Families, by what they call
<HI>City Fortunes;</HI> and how useful Trade has
always been, and still is in the World on
that Account; while others who call them∣selves
Gentlemen, by Way of Distinction,
became unworthy, by the Scandal of their
Morals, to match with the meanest Citi∣zen,
if she be a Woman of Modesty and
Virtue.</P>
<P>BUT to go on in generals, which is pro∣per
to the Head I am talking of; Trade
is the universal Fund of Wealth through∣out
the World; the Gold of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Bra∣zil,</HI>
the Silver of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> had
but for Trade remained undisturbed in the
Mines, and in the Sands of the Rivers of
<HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Chili:</HI> The Diamonds of <HI>Golconda,</HI>
and of <HI>Borneo</HI> had been glittering, in the
Dirt, and remain'd unpolish'd to this Day,
if Diligence had not found them out; if
Navigation had not assisted the Discovery,
and if Trade had not spread and dispers'd
them over the whole Globe.</P>
<P>EVEN <HI>Solomon</HI> had wanted Gold to
adorn the Temple, unless he had been sup∣ply'd
<PB N="14" REF="42"/>
by Miracles; if he had not turn'd
Merchant-Adventurer, and sent his Fleets
to fetch it from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> that is to
say, from <HI>Achin,</HI> on the Island of <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
which is supposed to be the <HI>Ophir</HI> which
his Factors procur'd it at.</P>
<P>So effectually has Trade rais'd the Wealth
of the World, that 'tis remarkable, and
worth the most curious Observation, that
throughout the known World, Nations,
and Kingdoms, and Governments are rich
or poor, as they have, or have not, a
Share of the whole Commerce of the
World, or more or less, some Concern
in it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> who are Enemies to Trade,
and who discourage Industry and Improve∣ment,
'tis plain they dispeople the World,
rather than improve and cultivate it: View
their Condition; they are miserably poor!
distressedly poor! they are idle, indolent
and starving, their Governments have some
Wealth, because they are tyrannical, and
take what they please from the poor People,
throughout a vast Extent of Dominion;
so that if it be but a little in a Place, it a∣mounts
to a very great Sum in the whole,
the People and Nations which are tributary
to them, being so many; but those People
and Nations are poor and wretched to the
last Degree, and all for Want of Trade.</P>
<P>As to Trade, excepting what the <HI>Europe∣ans</HI>
and the <HI>Jews</HI> drive among them, it is
<PB N="15" REF="43"/>
so little, that it hardly deserves the Name
of Commerce; they have neither Produce of
the Land, or Labour of the People; neither
Merchandise or Art, nothing is encouraged
among them; Ignorance boasts indeed of
the rich Return we bring from them, such
as Drugs, Hair; Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But we know it
is not of <HI>Turky,</HI> or the Growth of <HI>Turky,</HI>
but is either the Product of <HI>Armenia</HI> and
<HI>Georgia,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Guilan</HI> and <HI>In∣dostan,</HI>
Part of <HI>Persia</HI> on the Shoar of the
<HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, quite out of the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Do∣minions,
and even there they are the Pro∣duct
of the old Christians Labour, the ori∣ginal
Inhabitants of those Provinces; the
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> have little or no Hand in it;
they abhor Business and Labour, and despise
Industry, and they starve accordingly; or
those Goods are the Produce of the Islands
in the <HI>Levant</HI> and the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> where
the <HI>Cotton-yarn,</HI> the <HI>Grogram</HI> or <HI>Goats-Hair</HI>
Yarn, the white or <HI>Beladine Silks, &amp;c.</HI>
are the Manufacture of the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> In∣habitants
of those Islands, and who by their
Labour in Cultivation, cause the Earth to
produce the Silk and the Wool, and by their
Labours in Manufacturing, spin and make it
up into Yarn, and into Form, as we have
it from them. Now, <HI>see the Consequence;</HI>
as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> I say have little Trade,
so they have little Wealth, the Produce of
their Lands yields little, and that little sells
for such a little Value, that one would pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
<PB N="16" REF="44"/>
so vast a Body of People labouring, as it
were, for nothing; All the fruitful rich
Countries of <HI>Natolia</HI> and the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI>
from the <HI>Aegean</HI> to the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> once
the most rich, populous, and fertile Pro∣vinces
of the World, with all the <HI>Morea,</HI>
the <HI>Achaia,</HI> (the <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> of the An∣tients)
and the fruitful Plains of <HI>Thes∣saly,
Macedonia,</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> from the
<HI>Ionian Sea,</HI> to the Banks of the <HI>Danube;</HI>
what do they now produce? The great Ci∣ty
of <HI>Constantinople</HI> is supplied with Corn
indeed, but how? (<HI>N. B.</HI> This is the Rea∣son
of mentioning it) when produc'd, sold
to the Merchant, shipt on Board the Vessels
which carry it by Sea, the Freight paid, and
all Charges of loading and unloading; yet
their Barley has been bought in the Market
at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for 3 <HI>d. per</HI> Bushel.</P>
<P>IF this were some Ages ago, if in were
not known to be so very frequently, and
if there were not some Merchants now li∣ving
in <HI>London,</HI> who are Persons of un∣doubted
Credit, who assure me they have
bought it so: I say if it were only, that it
had been so some Ages ago, it had been
nothing extraordinary, for all know it has
been thus in <HI>England;</HI> but this has been
so at <HI>Constantinople</HI> within these Ten or
Twelve Years, and I doubt not it might be
prov'd is often so still in the same Place,
when plentiful Years of Corn happen;
what the poor Husband-man must have for
<PB N="17" REF="45"/>
his plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing,
and carrying it out, is hard to imagine;
or what the Landlord has for the Land:
But I suppose the Grand-Seignior is ge∣neral
Landlord, and has his Tax from the
whole Country, instead of Rent.</P>
<P>Now, whence is all this Poverty of a
Country? 'tis evident 'tis Want of Trade,
and nothing else: And we may go back
for an Example of it to our own Country,
when the Product of the Land, and the
Labour of the People were as low here,
when good Wheat was worth about 4 <HI>d.
per</HI> Bushel, a fat Sheep about 3 <HI>s. 4 d.</HI> and
a fat Ox about 18 to 24 <HI>s.</HI> and when was
this? But when we had no Trade, and be∣cause
we had no Trade; neither is the
present Difference owing to any Thing else,
but to the Increase of Commerce, as well
here as in other Parts of the World; and
'tis evident the Rate of Provisions, and
the Value of Lands in all Parts of the
World are high or low, great or small, as
the People have or have not Trade to
support it.</P>
<P>TRADE encourages Manufacture, prompts
Invention, employs People, increases La∣bour,
and pays Wages: As the People
are employ'd, they are paid, and by that
Pay are fed, cloathed, kept in Heart, and
kept together; that is, kept at Home, kept
from wandering into Foreign Countries
<PB N="18" REF="46"/>
to seek Business, for where the Employ∣ment
is, the People will be.</P>
<P>THIS keeping the People together, is
indeed the Sum of the whole Matter, for
as they are kept together, they multiply
together; and the Numbers, which by the
Way is the Wealth and Strength of the
Nation, increase.</P>
<P>As the Numbers of People increase,
the Consumption of Provisions increases; as
the Consumption increases, the Rate or
Value will rise at Market; and as the Rate
of Provisions rises, the Rents of Land rise:
So the Gentlemen are with the first to feel
the Benefit of Trade, by the Addition to
their Estates.</P>
<P>AND here it would not have been im∣proper
to have made a Transition to our
<HI>English</HI> History, and to have enquir'd how
punctually the Course of Things have
obey'd the Laws of Nature in this very
particular; how as Trade has increased; so
by equal Advances, Provisions have been
consum'd, Lands cultivated, Rents raised,
and the Estates of the Gentry and Nobili∣ty
been improv'd: I mean as to Periods of
Time, as well as to the Proportion of Va∣lue;
which Enquiry would have been an
unanswerable Proof of the Fact; but I am
confin'd here to Generals, and must only
lay it down as a Proposition.</P>
<P>As the Consumption of Provisions in∣crease,
more Lands are cultivated; waste
<PB N="19" REF="47"/>
Grounds are inclosed, Woods are grubb'd
up, Forrests and common Lands are till'd,
and improv'd; by this more Farmers are
brought together, more Farm-houses and
Cottages are built, and more Trades are
called upon to supply the necessary De∣mands
of Husbandry: In a Word, as Land
is employ'd, the People increase of Course,
and thus Trade sets all the Wheels of Im∣provement
in Motion; for from the Origi∣nal
of Business to this Day it appears, that
the Prosperity of a Nation rises and falls,
just as Trade is supported or decay'd.</P>
<P>As Trade prospers, Manufactures in∣crease;
as the Demand is greater or smal∣ler,
so also is the Quantity made; and so
the Wages of the Poor, the Rate of Pro∣visions,
and the Rents and Value of the
Lands rise or fall, as I said before.</P>
<P>AND here the very Power and Strength
of the Nation is concern'd also, for as the
Value of the Lands rises or falls, the
Taxes rise and fall in Proportion; all our
Taxes upon Land are a Kind of Pound
Rate; and bring in more or less, as the
stated Rents of the Land are more or less
in Value; and let any one calculate, by
the Rate of Lands in <HI>England,</HI> as they
went in the Times of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. or
even in King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Time, when
Trade began, as it were, just to live in
<HI>England;</HI> and tell us how much they think
<PB N="20" REF="48"/>
a Land Tax would then have brought in:
For Example,</P>
<P>IF a Tax of Four Shillings in the
Pound now brings in above Two Milli∣ons,
I suppose it would have been thought
very well then, if it had brought in Three
hundred thousand Pound, all the rest is an
Increase occasion'd by Trade, and by no∣thing
else; Trade has increas'd the People,
and People have increas'd Trade; for Mul∣titudes
of People, if they can be put in a
Condition to maintain themselves, must in∣crease
Trade; they must have Food, that
employs Land; they must have Clothes,
that employs the Manufacture; they must
have Houses, that employs Handicrafts; they
must have Houshold Stuff, that employs a
long Variety of Trades; so that in a Word
Trade employs People, and People employ
Trade.</P>
<P>I once saw a Calculation of Trade for
the planting a new Town in the South
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> where, for the Encou∣ragement
of People to come and settle, the
Lords of the Manors, (for the Place lay in
three Manors,) agreed to give a certain
Quantity of Lands to Fifty Farmers, who
would undertake to bring each two hundred
Pound Stock with them, and settle there.</P>
<P>TO every such Farmer, they allotted
two hundred Acres of good Land, Rent-free for Twenty Years; and if the Farmer
brought three hundred Pound Stock, he
<PB N="21" REF="49"/>
had three hundred Acres; besides the Land,
the said Lords agreed to find Timber, and
all other Materials for the Building, to eve∣ry
Farmer a House, and out of their own
Pockets to build to each House a Barn
and Stables; and thus, with other Encou∣ragements,
Fifty Families of substantial
Farmers were brought to live in a Kind
of Circle within themselves, with every
one a good Farm to manage, and sufficient
Quantity of Land Rent-free; the Land was
good in it self, tho' never cultivated before,
so that being clear'd and inclos'd, and gra∣dually
plow'd or improv'd, it soon return'd
them a profitable Increase.</P>
<P>THE Land was so laid out in a large
Circle, that all the Farm-houses being built
at the Extremities of the respective Farms,
toward the Center, left a handsome large
Square Piece of Land which the Lords
reserv'd for the building a Town; and as
the Farm-houses were so regularly plac'd,
as to front all inwards, they left Ten Spaces
like Streets before their Doors, of which
Five of the Farm-houses, with their Out∣Houses,
made one Side, and the other
remained to build into a Street as Occasion
should present.</P>
<P>AT the same Time they publish'd, That
whoever would come and build on that va∣cant
Ground, should have a certain propor∣tion'd
Measure of Land allow'd him, ac∣cording
to the Size of the House he would
<PB N="22" REF="50"/>
build, should have Timber given him gra∣tis,
out of the Woods belonging to the
Estate, sufficient for his Building; and to
every House, Land also added for a Garden
and Orchard, no Rent to be paid for ten
Years, and then a moderate Rent for twenty
Years more; and then a certain Rent (not
at last immoderate) for the Time to come.</P>
<P>WHEN the Farmers were settled, for
there is the Substance and Reason of the
Thing, and in this it is exactly to my Pur∣pose;
immediately comes a Butcher, and he
runs up a little Shed for the present, till he
could build a House, and sets up a Shop,
to kill and sell Meat for the Farmers.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As these Farmers had every one
two Hundred Pounds Stock to begin,
so they are supposed to be all Men of
Families, that had Wives and Chil∣dren,
and every one had at least one or
two, and some three Servants.</P>
<P>NOR could one Butcher be sufficient to
furnish Meat to fifty Families, but they
were oblig'd to send to neighbouring
Towns for Provision, till the first Butcher
having Encouragement, two or three more
came afterwards, and set up also.</P>
<P>AFTER the Example of the Butcher, in
the next Place came a Baker, and he erects
an Oven to supply them with Bread.</P>
<P>FIFTY Families of Farmers limit neces∣sarily
find Work for a Smith or Farrier to
Shoe their Horses, and at least two Wheel-wrights
<PB N="23" REF="51"/>
wrights to make and repair their Carts,
Waggons, Plows, Harrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and these
with the necessary Iron-work for so much
Building, called in a couple of Black-smiths,
whereof one being a Man of Substance,
made himself a kind of Iron-monger, laying
in a Stock of all Sorts of wrought Iron
and Brass for Building and Furniture, which
on such an Occasion they could not be
without.</P>
<P>THIS Collection of Tradesmen natural∣ly
requir'd a Shoe-maker or two to set up,
who soon found Trade enough to supply
the growing Numbers of People with
Shoes and Boots; and likewise a good ho∣nest
Country Cobler or two could not fail
of Employment to repair them; and (to add
the other Trades working in Leather,) they
could not be without a Collar-maker or
two, for Harness, Pannels, Saddles, and
all the necessary Things relating to a Team.</P>
<P>ADD to these a Turner, an Earthen-ware
Seller, a Glover, a Rope-maker, three or
four Barbers, (perhaps a <HI>Midwife</HI>) end seve∣ral
such Trades as the Nature of things re∣quired.</P>
<P>BUT to go back to the building Part,
three Master Carpenters would be the least
that could be employ'd in building Hou∣ses,
and these would require at first five or
six Pair of Sawyers at least, with Journey∣men;
that is to say, Workmen; two or
three Bricklayers, with their Servants and
<PB N="24" REF="52"/>
Labourers, and perhaps hard by a Brick and
Tile-maker.</P>
<P>To supply these, one of the Carpenters,
a Man of Substance, builds himself a Wind∣mil,
and another builds a second, and they
both find Work enough (as the Town en∣creased)
to keep them constantly employ'd.</P>
<P>THE Town going thus forward, and
standing in the great Post Road, comes
an honest Victualler, and he sets up an Ale-house;
and soon after, he is follow'd by
five or six more; as the first encreasing in
Stock, sees Room for it, he enlarges his
Building, and makes his little Ale-house out
into a good Inn, and a second follows him,
and then a third, and in Process of Time,
the Number of Public-Houses encrease to
eleven or twelve in all; whereof as above,
three are very handsome Inns, and per∣haps
sell Wine as well as strong Drink.</P>
<P>BY this Time the Lords of the Manors
begin to think it proper to build their new
Tenants a Church, for which they lay out
a handsome Piece of Ground in the Center
of the Town, and a large Burying-Ground
added to it; and obtaining Licence from
the Bishop, they consecrate the Building;
and being joint Patrons, present in Turn,
getting a Law to erect it into a Parish,
and to assertain the Tithe and Maintenance
of the Incumbent, as in like Cases.</P>
<P>HITHER TO Nature acted it all, but this
Part indeed, the Piety of the Patrons supplies;
<PB N="25" REF="53"/>
our Business is (in both) to observe the ordi∣nary
Course of Things, the Concourse of
Tradesmen follow the Concourse of People,
as naturally as Warmth attends the Ap∣proach
of the Sun; the Settlement of the
Farmers gives a Summons to the Tradesmen
that supply them with Necessaries, and lets
them know, that there they may find Bu∣siness
and Employment: The necessity of
Meat and Drink, brings the Butcher, Ba∣ker
and Victualler to settle with them, as
naturally as Sutlers follow an Army.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed; Fame spreads the News
of a Town newly erected, and a Number
of Families brought together; A Grocer
goes to see if there is no Room for him,
and finding no Supplies of his Kind, he
takes a Piece of Ground in one of the
principal Streets, and marks himself out a
Place for his House; but first, as before,
runs up a Booth or Shed, stores it with
Goods, and opens a Shop, and two or
three Chandlers Shops do the same in re∣moter
Parts, buying their Goods perhaps of
him.</P>
<P>AN Apothecary does the like next Door
to him, and a Mercer next to him; then a
Haberdasher of Hats, a Draper and a Mil∣lener;
and thus the Town is inhabited and
furnish'd by Degrees with all Sorts of ne∣cessary
People and Things; till after some
Time, the Lords of the Manors, to carry
on the Improvement, get a Patent for a
<PB N="26" REF="54"/>
Market once a Week, and a Fair perhaps
twice a Year, or oftner, as there is Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>IN these advanc'd Circumstances, other
Trades fall in; as <HI>Ist,</HI> more Ale-houses;
<HI>2d,</HI> a common Brewer; <HI>3d,</HI> a Cooper for
Casks of all Sorts; a Pewterer, two or
three Lawyers, (or Attorneys, rather) for
drawing Writings, making Bonds, Bargains
and Agreements between Man and Man,
and one of these in Time gets himself made
a Justice of Peace, and so there is an imme∣diate
Magistrate among them.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time other Trades fill up
the Streets; a Malt-house, perhaps two or
three are erected, that the Inhabitants may
brew their own Beer if they please; a Sur∣geon
in Case of Disaster, for by this Time
the Town begins to grow populous.</P>
<P>THE good Women also being diligent,
and good House-wives, they spin, and in
Consequence of that, there must be a Li∣nen
Weaver, and a Woollen-weaver, a Flax
and Hemp-dresser, and in a word, whatever
depends upon their Thrift.</P>
<P>THUS far the Nature and Consequence
of Things agree with what is advanced a∣bove:
Thus Towns and Families, nay Na∣tions
and Countries are planted and peo∣pled,
and made flourishing and populous by
their Commerce.</P>
<P>LET us now cast up the Account,
and according to antient Custom Number
<PB N="27" REF="55"/>
the People, the List by the Poll will stand
thus.</P>
<LIST>
<LABEL>50 Farmers, with their Wives and
Two Children each, one with a∣nother,
which I take to be the least
that can be supposed.</LABEL>
<ITEM>200</ITEM>
<LABEL>TWO Men Servants and one Maid
to each Farmer, no Farmer with
200 Acres of Land could be sup∣posed
to make Shift with less.</LABEL>
<ITEM>150</ITEM>
<LABEL>THE several Families of Tradesmen
necessarily brought together on
such an Occasion, I cast up at 143
Families, at 5 to each House.</LABEL>
<ITEM>715</ITEM>
<LABEL>ADD to these hired Servants which
would fall in from other Coun∣tries;
Nurses, Midwives, Host∣lers,
Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In all</LABEL>
<ITEM>335</ITEM>
<LABEL></LABEL>
<ITEM>1400</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HERE are fifty Farmers, who with their
Servants make up but three hundred and
fifty People in all; but necessarily draw one
thousand one hundred People more to them.
Thus People make Trade, Trade builds
Towns and Cities, and produces every
Thing that is good and great in a Nation;
and wherever fifty Farmers were thus to
settle, I insist, that at least one thousand
People must of course throng to them, and
live about them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="56"/>
THERE are Numbers of Examples to be
given of it, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Republick began
thus; a despicable Croud of People flying
from the Fury of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> which
over-run the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, took Shelter
in a few inaccessible Islands of the <HI>Adria∣tic</HI>
Gulph.</P>
<P>HERE they had Safety indeed, and Life;
but nothing else. But falling into Trade,
applying themselves to the Sea, to Navi∣gation
and Commerce; How soon did
they raise themselves in the World, spread∣ing
themselves into the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> and
into the <HI>Levant;</HI> conquering the great and
rich Islands of <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Cyprus, Negro∣pont</HI>
and <HI>Scio,</HI> possess'd the <HI>Morea, Dalma∣tia</HI>
and <HI>Epirus,</HI> and gradually rais'd their
Dominion to such a Degree, as was superi∣or
to many Kingdoms.</P>
<P>THEIR City we see raised to a prodigious
Splendor and Magnificence, and their rich
Merchants rank'd among the ancient No∣bility,
and all this by Trade: Their Fleets
of Men of War have oftentimes engag'd
and beaten the <HI>Turkish</HI> Navy, driven them
into Port, and dar'd them at the Mouth of
the <HI>Dardanelli;</HI> and all this Power is rais'd
by Trade.</P>
<P>I might from this Example lead you to
the <HI>Hans,</HI> the great Confederacy of Com∣merce,
the greatest in the World; who
meerly by the acquir'd Greatness of their
Trade, became so rich, and so powerful, that
<PB N="29" REF="57"/>
they were many Years the Terror of the
North; whoever hired their Men of War,
were sure to conquer their Enemies at Sea,
and several times they beat whole Fleets of
the <HI>Danes,</HI> and at last brought the King of
<HI>Denmark</HI> to make a dishonourable Peace
with them; till the Kings of the neighbour∣ing
Countries grew justly jealous of them,
and oblig'd all the Cities within their Juris∣diction
to withdraw from their Alliance,
and to renounce their Confederacy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch,</HI> I mean the States-General
of the united Provinces, when they broke
off from the Obedience of <HI>Spain,</HI> and as
it may be rightly said, cast off the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Yoke, were a poor, mean, frighted Genera∣tion,
driven to the Refuge of the Water,
by the terrible Power of King <HI>Philip,</HI> and
reduc'd to such Distress, that, but for the
Assistance of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> they had
been ruin'd and destroy'd; yet pushing in∣to
Trade, and having Recourse to the Sea,
they built themselves upon their Marine
Power; and the Success of their Navigation
rais'd them to that Pitch of Naval Greatness
which we now see them at, in which they
are superior to all the World, <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
excepted, of whom I shall speak by
themselves.</P>
<P>AS it has been with Nations, so it has
been with Cities and Towns; such has
been the Case of the Cities of <HI>Hamburgh,
Dantzick, Lubec, Franckfort, Nurem∣berg,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="58"/>
Rochelle, Marseilles, Genoa, <HI>Leg∣horn,
Geneva,</HI> and many other Cities that
might be nam'd, who have been rais'd to a
Pitch of Opulence and Wealth, equal to
some Principalities, by their meer Situati∣on
for, and Success in their <HI>Commerce:</HI> I on
the other hand might name several Cities,
which being depriv'd of their Trade, have
sunk again in Proportion, as their Trade
has been taken away; such as the City of
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Dunkirk, South∣ampton,
Ipswich,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>AS their Trade has been cut off, their
Merchants have removed, the Inhabitants
decreased, and the Shells of the Towns re∣main
without the Kernel, the Houses with∣out
the People, and the People without the
Wealth.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Dutch</HI> cut off the free Navi∣gation
of the <HI>Scheld</HI> from the City of <HI>Ant∣werp,</HI>
how did it decline? the <HI>English</HI>
Staple remov'd to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the Fishing
Trade to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and the Merchants
followed; and what is that City now com∣par'd
to what it formerly was?</P>
<P>WHEN the King of <HI>France</HI> was oblig'd
by the late War to demolish the Works, and
ruin the Harbour of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> so that the
Navigation received a Blow; How did
the Town sensibly decay? from eighteen
thousand Families, which once inhabited
that Place, 'tis said, not two Thirds remain;
all the People depending upon the Naval
<PB N="31" REF="59"/>
Affairs, are gone with the royal Arsenal;
all the Magazines of Naval-Stores, either
for the King or the Merchant, employ'd
and carried off; and the Trade that attend∣ed
that Part sunk with it; few Ships now
belong to it, few Merchants now reside in
it, and in a few Years more, the empty
Houses being unrepaired, may publish its
Decay in a more visible Manner, and shew
the Wounds receiv'd by the Loss of their
Trade, as is the Case at <HI>Southampton,</HI> at
<HI>Ipswich,&amp;c.</HI> in a visible Manner.</P>
<P>I need not travel over the Globe, to give
you Examples in remoter Places, where
the great Emporiums, the greatest trading
Cities in the World, have sunk into Ruin
by the Stop of their Commerce, such as
<HI>Tripoli, Sinope,</HI> and <HI>Trapezond</HI> in the
<HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black Sea,</HI> whose Trade is cut
off, by the <HI>Turks</HI> stopping the Navigation
of the <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> and cutting off the
Trade they carried on with <HI>Europe;</HI> or
such as <HI>Suez,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> Ports an∣tiently
of prodigious Concourse, both of
Ships and Merchants; but emptied of both,
by the <HI>Europeans</HI> finding the Way to the
<HI>East Indies</HI> by the Cape of <HI>Good-hope;</HI> or
such as the famous Cities of <HI>Tyre</HI> and
<HI>Corinth,</HI> who having been the Envy of the
World for Wealth, and that Wealth obtain'd
by their Commerce, were overturn'd; the
first by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the last by the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
purely for the avaritious Part; and
<PB N="32" REF="60"/>
who, their Merchants being destroy'd, and
their Trade overthrown, never recover'd
their Figure any more than their Fortunes
in the World.</P>
<P>IN a Word, it appears by innumerable
Examples, that Trade is the Life of the
World's Prosperity, and all the Wealth that
has been extraordinary, whether of Na∣tions
or Cities, has been raised by it.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the Thing indeed im∣plies
it; as the Industry of Mankind is set
on Work, their Hopes and Views are rais'd,
and their Ambition fir'd: The View and
Prospect of Gain inspires the World with the
keenest Vigor, puts new Life into their
Souls; and when they see the Success and
Prosperity of trading Nations, it rouzes
them up to the like Application.</P>
<P>LET us view the differing Face of the
Nations, (and of the People who inhabit
them) where they have no Trade; how mi∣serable
is the Scene of Life? The Countries
look desolate, the People sad and dejected,
poor and disconsolate, heavy and indolent;
not for Want of Will to labour, but for
Want of something to labour profitably at;
the Rich are slothful, because they are rich
and proud, the Poor, because they are
poor and despair; for it will ever be true</P>
<P>That Poverty makes Sloth, and Sloth
makes 'Poor.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="61"/>
We say of some Nations, the People are
lazy, but we should say only, they are poor;
Poverty is the Fountain of all Manner
of Idleness; they have in short nothing to
do, no Employment in which they can get
their Bread by their Labour; their Work
gets no Wages for Want of Trade, and
their Trade no Increase for Want of La∣bour;
Diligence promotes Trade, and Trade
encourages Diligence; Labour feeds Trade,
and Trade feeds the Labourer.</P>
<P>THERE is hardly that Country to be
nam'd in the World, where there is no
Room for Improvement by Industry and
Application; nay, we find an industrious
People often thriving and wealthy, under
the weighty Discouragements of a barren
Soil, an inhospitable Climate, a tempestu∣ous
Sea, a remote Situation, having yet
something or other for Trade to work
upon.</P>
<P>THE People of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> ha∣ving
nothing but Mountains and Woods,
and the most barren inclement Air and Soil
in the World; yet, rather than not trade,
and rather than not labour, they cut down
their Trees, and send them abroad to build
Cities, and build Navies in other Countries,
and have hardly any of their own.</P>
<P>IF their Woods grow remote from the
Sea or Water Carriage, Industry dictates
to them to cut them down and burn them;
and to trade, if it be but with the very

Sap and Juices of the Trees: Hence they
send us Tar, Pitch, Rozin, Turpentine;
and we see as it were a whole Wood
brought away in Cask; Ten, Twenty
Thousand Last of Tar brought from <HI>Russia</HI>
at a Time, every Last being Ten to Twelve

<P>IF <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spitsbergen</HI> are un∣sufferably
cold: if Nature, not being able to
support the Violence of it, leaves those Pla∣ces
uninhabited; the diligent Trader not
being to be discouraged by Difficulties, flies
directly thither; there among a Thousand
Dangers, surrounded with Mountains of
Ice, terrible, and Horrors enough to chill
the very Soul to describe them, <HI>Hunts</HI>
the great <HI>Leviathan</HI> of the Seas, and loads
his Ships with the fat (BLUBBER) of a Thou∣sand
Whales.</P>
<P>I might instance in the Severities of the
torrid, as well as frigid Zone, and shew
the Hardships undergone in Places scorch'd
with the Violence of the Heat; and which
are every Way as terrible in their Kind, as
those of excessive Cold; such are the Dis∣eases
and Terrors of the long Calms, where
the Sea stagnates and corrupts for Want of
Motion; and by the Strength of the
Scorching Sun stinks and poisons the di∣strest
Mariners, who are rendered unactive,
and disabled by Scurvies, raging and mad
with Calentures and Fevers, and drop
into Death in such a Manner, that at last
<PB N="35" REF="63"/>
the Living are lost, for Want of the Dead,
that is, for want of Hands to work the Ship.</P>
<P>YET nothing discourages the diligent
Seaman, or the adventrous Merchant in
Pursuit of Trade, and pushing on Discove∣ries,
planting Colonies, and settling Com∣merce,
even to all Parts of the World.</P>
<P>NOW as I said before, that the Nations
who want Trade look dejected and sad, so
on the contrary, let the curious Traveller
observe, as he passes thro' the World, the
trading manufacturing Nations have a quite
different Aspect; their Labour, however
hard and heavy, is perform'd chearfully;
a general Sprightliness and Vigour appears
among them; their Countenances are blith,
and they are merrier at their Labour, than
others are at their Play; their Hearts are
warm, as their Hands are quick; they are
all Spirit and Life, and it may be seen in
their Faces; or which is more, it is seen
in their Labour; as they live better than
the Poor of the same Class in other Coun∣tries,
so they work harder: And here the
same <HI>Antithesis</HI> is observable as before, tho'
in its contrary Extreme; for as I said there,
that Poverty makes Sloth, and Sloth makes
Poor: So here,
<Q>Labour makes Gain, and Gain gives
Strength to Labour.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="64"/>
AS they labour harder, so they get more
for their Work than other Nations, and
this gives them Spirit for their Labour.
And this is the immediate Effect of Trade,
for the Poor of the trading and manufac∣turing
Countries are employ'd on better
Terms, and have better Wages for their
Work, than the Poor of those Countries
where there is less Trade.</P>
<P>WE are told, that in <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
when for want of Commerce, La∣bour
was not assisted by Art; they had no
other Way to cut out a large Plank, but
by felling a great Tree, and then with a
multitude of Hands and Axes hew away
all the Sides of the Timber, till they re∣duc'd
the middle to one large Plank; and
that yet, when it was done, they would
sell this Plank as cheap, as the <HI>Swedes</HI> or
<HI>Prussians</HI> did the like, who cut three or
four, or more Planks of the like Size from
one Tree by the Help of Saws and Saw-Mills:
The Consequence must be, that
the miserable <HI>Russian</HI> labour'd ten times
as much as the other did, for the same
Money.</P>
<P>WE are told frequently, when such and
such great Works or Buildings were finish∣ed,
Men work'd for a Penny a Day here
in <HI>England;</HI> and perhaps they did so; but
as I said before, speaking of the Cheapness
of Provisions, that it was before we had
any Trade among us; so it must be as to
<PB N="37" REF="65"/>
Wages, for as Trade raises Wages, so Wa∣ges
raise Provisions; and this is the Rea∣son,
why, as all Foreigners grant that our
Poor in <HI>England</HI> work harder than they
do in any other Nation; so it must be
own'd, they eat and drink better in Pro∣portion;
and this is, because they have bet∣ter
Wages.</P>
<P>I might examine this Article of Wages,
and carry it thro' almost every Branch of
Business in <HI>England;</HI> and it would ap∣pear,
that the <HI>English</HI> Poor earn more
Money than the same Class of Men or
Women can do at the same kind of Work,
in any other Nation.</P>
<P>NOR will it be deny'd, but that they do
more Work also: So then, if they do more
Work, and have better Wages too, they
must needs live better, and fare better;
and it is true also, that they cannot sup∣port
their Labour without it.</P>
<P>AND here I may grant, that a <HI>French</HI>
Man shall do more Work than an <HI>English</HI>
Man, if they shall be oblig'd to live on the
same Diet; that is to say, the Foreigner shall
starve with the <HI>English</HI> Man for a Wager,
and will be sure to win: He will live and
work, when the <HI>English</HI> Man shall sink
and dye; but let them live both the same
Way, the <HI>English</HI> Man shall beggar the
<HI>French</HI> Man, for tho' the <HI>French</HI> Man
were to spend all his Wages, the <HI>English</HI>
Man will out-work him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="66"/>
IT is true again, the <HI>French</HI> Man's Di∣ligence
is the greatest, he shall work more
Hours than the <HI>English</HI> Man; but the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Man shall do as much Business in the
fewer Hours, as the Foreigner who sits
longer at it.</P>
<P>TO conclude this Head, I would not
seem to be partial in Favour of our own
Country; but it must be added, that their
Work is better perform'd also; and I ap∣peal
for the Truth of it, to their several Per∣formances,
of which I could give Examples,
and which all the Markets in the World are
at this Time Witnesses to; but this begins
to be particular, I shall speak at large to
the several Examples of it in their proper
Places.</P>
<P>IT is sufficient to the Purpose here to
observe as above, that the diligent trading
manufacturing World work chearfully, live
comfortably; they sing at their Labour,
work by their Choice, eat and drink well,
and their Work goes on pleasantly, and with
Success: Whereas the unemploy'd World
groan out their Souls in Anguish and Sor∣row,
not by their Work, but for want of
it; and sink, as I may justly say, under the
Weight of their Idleness and Sloth; what
little Work they do, is done with Reluct∣ance
and Grief, because the small Wages
they have for it, gives them no Comfort
when it is done.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="67"/>
TRAVELLING in the North Part of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
I observed, that, in the Time of
their Harvest, they had always an Over∣seer
to keep the Reapers to their Work,
and a Bag-pipe to encourage them while
they were at Work: And one of our Com∣pany
observing that we had no such merry
Doings at our Harvests in <HI>England;</HI> ano∣ther
answer'd him, 'twas true, nor was
there any need of it, for that the <HI>English</HI>
work'd merrily enough without Musick; ad∣ding,
our Workmen have good Victuals and
good Drink: Let's enquire how these poor
People feed, said he; and so we did, when
we found that the best of their Provision
was a Cake of Oat Bread, which they call
a Bannock, and a Draught of Water only;
and twice in the Day, the Farmer or Stew∣ard
gave them every one a Dram of <HI>Glas∣gow</HI>
Brandy, as they call'd it; that is to
say, good Malt Spirits.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it was evident, the
poor Men had need enough of Music to
encourage them at their Labour; nor
would the Music do neither, without the
Overseer or Steward being in the Field too,
to see that they stood to their Work.</P>
<P>IN <HI>England</HI> we see the Farmers in Har∣vest
Time, providing good Beef and Mut∣ton,
Pyes, Puddings, and other Provisions
to a strange Profusion, feasting their Work∣men,
rather than feeding them; and giving
them good Wages besides: But let any
<PB N="40" REF="68"/>
Man see the difference of the Work, these
need no Music, the Feast is better than the
Fiddle, and the Pudding does more than the
Bag-Pipe; <HI>in short,</HI> they work with a Vigor
and Spirit, not to be seen in other Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>I could give like Examples among the
Manufacturers; the Spirit and Courage of
the Workmen, is seen in the Goodness and
Substance of their Manufacture; of which,
this must be said, our Manufacture may
not be so cheap as the same Kinds made in
other Countries; but bring them to the
Scale and try their Substance, you will find
the <HI>English</HI> Man's Work, according to his
Wages, out-weigh the other; as his Beer
is strong, so is his Work; and as he gives
more Strength of Sinews to his Strokes
in the Loom, his Work is firmer and faster,
and carries a greater Substance with it, than
the same Kinds of Goods, and of the same
Denomination made in foreign Parts.</P>
<P>I remember in our former Contests a∣bout
Commerce, great Noise was made of
the <HI>French</HI> imitating our woollen Manu∣facture,
and making them to such Perfecti∣on,
as to out-do us in foreign Markets;
from whence it was inferr'd, that they
would in Time supplant our Trade, and
carry away the Business from us: The Rea∣son
that was given, was, that their Poor
could work so much cheaper than ours, that
their Goods would be sold cheaper than
<PB N="41" REF="69"/>
the <HI>English,</HI> and consequently they would
have the first and best of the Market al∣ways
from us; and had this been fully and
fairly made out; had they brought sufficient
Evidence of the Facts suggested, the Infe∣rence
had been good. Now to prove how
finely the <HI>French</HI> perform'd, and how good
their Cloths were; Patterns were shew'd
here of their several Cloths, as finish'd for
the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, by the great Manufacto∣ry,
as they call it, in <HI>Languedoc;</HI> for it was
this Part that was brought for the Sup∣port
of the Argument; and it is true,
that the Patterns were extraordinary, the
Cloth well dress'd, the Colours well dy'd;
nay, to Perfection; and to a superficial Eye,
they rather went beyond the <HI>English,</HI> than
come short of them.</P>
<P>BUT when they came to be look'd well
into by Clothiers and Workmen who un∣derstood
it, and whose Business it was; the
Deficiency soon discover'd it self; their
Cloths appear'd to be slight, thin, with∣out
Substance and Proportion, and unfit to
do Service in wearing; in a word, they
were no Way equal in Goodness to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Manufucture of the same Kind. This
was farther prov'd by the <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer∣chants
at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and other
Places in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the said Goods were
usually sold; where upon bringing the
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Cloths to the Scale,
there was no Comparison between them;
<PB N="42" REF="70"/>
but the <HI>English</HI> always out-weigh'd them
forty to fifty Pound <HI>per</HI> Bale, and some∣times
much more; the Consequence of
which was,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT those <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants
would very seldom buy the <HI>French Cloths,</HI>
so long as there were any of the <HI>English
Cloths</HI> left at the Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT when they did buy them,
they always had them at a much cheaper
Rate.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THIS is an evident Proof of the <HI>English</HI>
manner of performing; and it will hold in
many other Cases, perhaps in all Manufac∣turing
Cases: The strong Labour of the
<HI>English</HI> Workmen in all their manual Ope∣rations
is very remarkable in the Works
themselves: And I say, it is evident in many
other Manufactures, besides that of Broad-Cloths; <HI>in a word,</HI> our Workmen, by the
meer Vigour and Strength of their Spirits,
supported by their strong Feeding, and by
their better Wages than in any other Na∣tion,
are not used to work slight and super∣ficially,
but strong and substantial in every
Thing they do; and as they have better
Wages for it than other Nations give, and
perform their Work accordingly, so their
Goods make it evident, for that they fetch
a better Price at Market, than any Goods
of the same Species, made in any other
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="71"/>
IT is the same Thing in their several
Manufactures of Brass and Iron, and other
Hard-ware Works; but especially, in their
building of Ships, in which it is evident,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French, Swedes</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI>
build cheaper; but the <HI>English</HI> build stron∣ger
and firmer; and an <HI>English</HI> Ship will
always endure more severity, load heavier,
and reign (<HI>as the Seamen call it</HI>) longer,
than any foreign built Ship whatever; the
Examples are seen every Year, particularly
in the Coal Trade, the Loading of which is
very heavy, and the Ships swim deep in the
Water, by the Eagerness of the Matters,
to carry large Burthens; and yet it is fre∣quently
known, that a <HI>New-Castle</HI> or <HI>Ips∣wich
built Colier,</HI> shall reign, (as I say the
Seamen call it) forty to fifty Years, and
come to a good End at last; that is, be
broken up; not founder at Sea, or break
her Back upon the Sands, as Ships weaker
built, often, nay generally do.</P>
<P>THE firm Building, as well as beautiful
Moulds of our Men of War confirm this
also, in which they out-last, as well as out∣shine,
the strongest and finest built Ships
of most other Nations, it not of all Nations
in <HI>Europe,</HI> except only those Castle-built
clumsy Things called <HI>Galeons,</HI> which are
built so strong, that is, so thick, that they
are scarce fit for any thing.</P>
<P>THE Comparison is still to my Purpose
in every Part, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that Trade invigorates
<PB N="44" REF="72"/>
the World, gives Employment to the Peo∣ple,
raises Pay for their Labour, and en∣creases
that Pay as their Labour encreases,
and as their Performance excels; and it ap∣pears
that what is said of <HI>England</HI> is no Com∣pliment
to our own Country, but a real,
historical Truth; for that 'tis undeniable,
that the Labour of the Poor is no where ra∣ted
so high as in <HI>England:</HI> There is no
Nation in the World where the Poor have
equal Wages for their Work as in <HI>England,</HI>
in Proportion to the Rate of Money, and
to the Rate of Provisions.</P>
<P>BY this Means the labouring Poor are
kept in Heart, kept stong, and made able
for the Business they are employ'd in;
and the contrary, is the Reason why the
<HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Italians,</HI> and most other Na∣tions,
rather make their Manufacture (of
any Kind) gay than good, fine than strong.
I allow them to be as exquisite in Art, nay
I may allow them to be more apt to in∣vent
and contrive, and perhaps finish some
Things with more Ornament: But for
Strength of Hand in their Works, where
Strength is essential to the Value of the
Work, there our People out-do them all.</P>
<P>I could carry this on thro' many Parti∣culars,
and it would lead me into some ve∣ry
useful Speculations, but they would
be remote from my Purpose; I bring it back
therefore to the single Point which I am
upon; namely, the great Advantage of
<PB N="45" REF="73"/>
Commerce to the World, and to particu∣lar
Nations.</P>
<P>WHEN we had no Trade, we had no
Ships, no populous Cities, no Numbers
of People, no Wealth compar'd to what
we see now; Provisions bore no Price,
Lands yielded no Rent; and why? The
Reason is plain and short; 'tis sum'd up in
a Word, <HI>Labour</HI> brought in <HI>no Wages.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> OBSERVE by the Word, no, or
none, is not meant litterally and strictly
<HI>none at all;</HI> but comparatively none
compar'd to what is seen now.</P>
<P>THE People were divided into Master
and Servant; not Landlord and Tenant,
but the Lord and the Vassal; the Tenant
paid no Rent, but held his Lands in Vas∣sallage;
that is, for Services to be perform∣ed;
such and such Tenants plow'd his
Land; such and such fenc'd his Park; such
and such Lands were let out to furnish the
Lord's Kitchen with Poultry, such with
Eggs, some with one Thing, some with
another; and thus the Lord liv'd, as the
<HI>Scots</HI> call it, in the middle of his Geer.</P>
<P>THE under People to these Tenants held
by Villenage; that is, the Labourers, those
we now call Husbandmen and Cottagers,
these did the Drudgery, were Grooms to
look after his Horses, drive his Teams, fell
his Woods, Fence, Hedge. Ditch, Thresh,
and in a Word, do all servile Labours;
and for this they had their Bread; that is,
<PB N="46" REF="74"/>
they had a poor Cottage, scarce so good as
a tolerable modern Hogstye to live in,
they drank at the Pump, and eat at the Kit∣chen
Door, Beggar-like: As for the rest,
the Lord of the Manor was their King;
nay, if I had said their God, I had not
err'd, so much as some may think; for they
worship'd him with such a blind Subjecti∣on,
that at his Command they would re∣bel
against their King, and take up the Bow
and Arrow against whomsoever he com∣manded
them.</P>
<P>THIS was the Case, even in this flourish∣ing
Nation of <HI>England,</HI> till Trade came in
to make the Difference; and give me leave
to assume so much, I insist upon it, that
Trade alone made the Difference; and the
Climax is very remarkable.</P>
<P>BEFORE the People fell into Trade,
what was the Case as to Wealth? You see
how it stood with the People; but what
was the Case of the Trade.</P>
<P>1. WE had no Manufacture; we had
Wool indeed, and Tin, and Lead, those
were Funds, and brought in some Sub∣stance;
but who had it? Truly, the Church
and the Gentry; the religious Houses and
the Barons had the Lands and the Sheep,
and consequently the Wool: And we find
that in King <HI>Edward</HI> III's Time, the
Clergy and the religious Houses gave the
King a fifth Part of all their Wool for car∣rying
on his Wars against <HI>France:</HI> This
<PB N="47" REF="75"/>
Wool was sent abroad to the <HI>Flemings,</HI>
and this Money was the Wealth of the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>2. THIS Money went all abroad again
generally speaking, for those ruinous Wars,
which for many Ages the Kings of <HI>England</HI>
carried on, sometimes in <HI>France;</HI> sometimes
in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> sometimes in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
sometimes in <HI>Brittany,</HI> and the like in o∣ther
Places; so that still the People were
impoverish'd, I mean the Gentry and Cler∣gy;
for this Wealth was theirs, and
they paid all the Taxes: As for the labour∣ing
Poor, they scarcely knew what Money
was.</P>
<P>3. AS to Trade, it was carry'd on by
the <HI>Esterlings;</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Hans</HI>
Towns, and by the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and they
carry'd away your Wool, Lead, Tin, and
whatever else you had, and supply'd you a∣gain
with Cloths, Spice, (Wine there was
none, or but little to be had) and in a
word, with Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Iron,
and whatever else was to be had from A∣broad;
and these run away with all the lit∣tle
Wealth which the King and the Wars
left among you; they brought you Ships,
they coin'd your Money, and they in short
grew rich by you, and you look'd on and
starv'd.</P>
<P>AT last, by the Prudence of King <HI>Henry</HI>
VII. you fell to Trade among yourselves;
and gradually getting Ground of the World,
<PB N="48" REF="76"/>
you made yourselves Masters of your own
Manufactures, about the middle of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Reign; and what she did to en∣courage
it, I shall shew in its Place. And
now what follow'd? The Consequences
were most gloriously seen in a few Years, as
follows.</P>
<P>1. YOUR People turn'd Merchants abroad,
as well as Manufacturers at home: They
tasted the Sweets of Commerce, and being
encourag'd by the Gain, soon supplanted
their Supplanters, built their own Ships, sent
out their own Goods, brought Home their
own Returns, cashier'd the <HI>Esterlings,</HI> for∣bid
the Wool going Abroad, and thereby
ruin'd the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and thus they set up
for themselves.</P>
<P>2. AS to the Country, the Revolution of
Trade, brought a Revolution in the very
Nature of Things; the Poor began to
work, not for Cottages and Liveries, but
for Money, and to live, as we say, at their
own Hands: The Women and Children
learnt to spin and get Money for it, a
Thing entirely new to them, and what they
had never seen before. The Men left the
Hedge and the Ditch, and were set at Work
by the Manufacturers to be Wool-Comb∣ers,
Weavers, Fullers, Clothworkers, Car∣riers,
and innumerable happy Labours they
perform'd, which they knew nothing of be∣fore;
nay the <HI>Flemings</HI> came over (for Mo∣ney)
and taught them how to perform those
<PB N="49" REF="77"/>
Things at first, <HI>I say at first,</HI> for the People
soon became able to send Home their Ma∣sters,
and teach one another; then the
Villains and Vassals were taken Appren∣tices
to the Manufacturers, till coming to
be Masters, the Name, nay the very Things
themselves call'd Vassalage and Villanage
grew out of Use. The Vassals got Money
by Trade, and the Villains by Labour; and
the Lords found the Sweets of it too, for
they soon buy off the Services, and bring
the Lords to take Money. Thus the Cot∣tagers
growing rich, bought their little
Cotts with right of Commonage for their
Lives, renewable so and so, as they could
agree, and this was called Coppy-hold.
On the other hand, the Vassals and Feu∣holders,
as they are call'd to this Day in
the <HI>North,</HI> growing rich, lump'd it with
the Lords, and for a Sum of Money bought
off their slavish Tenures, and got their
Leases turn'd into Free-holds; and to finish
the great Fabrick, the Farmers of Lands
were now enabled to take them at a Rent
certain, and the Gentry got a Revenue in
Money, which they understood nothing of
before.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the differing
Effects of Luxury and Frugality, which
became more than ordinarily visible upon
this Change of Affairs; namely, that as
the frugal Manufacturers, encourag'd by
their Success, doubled their Industry and
<PB N="50" REF="78"/>
good Husbandty, they lay'd up Money, and
grew rich; and the luxurious and Purse
proud Gentry, tickl'd with the happy En∣crease
of their Revenues, and the rising Va∣lue
of their Rents, grew vain, gay, luxu∣rious
and expensive: So the first encreas'd
daily, and the latter, with all their new en∣creas'd
and advanc'd Revenues, yet grew
poor and necessitous, till the former began
to buy them out; and have so bought them
out, that whereas in those Days, the Lands
were all in the Hands of the <HI>Barons;</HI> that
is to say, the Nobility, and even the
Knights and Esquires who had Lands, and
were call'd the Gentry, held them by ser∣vile
Tenures, as above: Now we see the
Nobility and the ancient Gentry have al∣most
every where sold their Estates, and the
Commonalty and Tradesmen have bought
them: So that now the Gentry are richer
than the Nobility, and the Tradesmen are
richer than them all.</P>
<P>I have given this Sketch of the growing
Wealth of the World by Trade, as in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
that is, I have placed the Scene as in
<HI>England,</HI> because being talking to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Nation, it will be understood with the
more ease. But the Subject is general, and
the Thing is not of private Interpretation:
It will hold in its Degree, in all the
trading Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as here;
tho' perhaps in none more eminently, the
Trade here having made so visible a Change
<PB N="51" REF="79"/>
in the Face of the Nation, and in the Cir∣cumstances
of the People, that the like is
not to be shewn of any other Nation, in
so very remarkable a Degree; so that if I
had been Writing in any other Country or
Language, I should certainly have singled
out <HI>England</HI> for an Example.</P>
<P>I may, however, refer to other Nations
for Evidence in their Proportion, for in all
the Manufacturing Countries in <HI>Europe</HI>
the Case is the same in Degree; as Trade
has encreas'd, the Miseries of the People
have abated, the Poor being employ'd by
Manufacture, by Navigation, and the or∣dinary
Labours which Trade furnishes for
their Hands; they have accordingly liv'd
better, their Poverty has been less, and they
have been able to feed, who before might
be said only to starve; and in those Coun∣tries
'tis observable, that where Trade is most
effectually extended, and has the greatest
Influence, there the Poor live best, their
Wages are highest; and where Wages are
highest, the Consumption of Provisions en∣creases
most; where the Consumption of
Provision is most encreas'd, the Rate of
Provision is highest; and where Provisions
are dearest, the Rents of Lands are ad∣vanc'd
most.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>for the Climax does not end here;</HI>
where the Rents of Lands are advanc'd, the
Taxes and Payments to the Governour are
the larger; and where the larger Taxes
<PB N="52" REF="80"/>
are levy'd, the Revenue being encreased,
that Prince or Governour is the richer;
and where Nations grow richer, they in
Proportion grow more powerful.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is the Foundation of Wealth,
and Wealth of Power: In former Days the
Poverty of the northern Nations added to
their Multitude, made them formidable;
as the People encreas'd, the Country not
being able to maintain them, the old ones
drove the young ones out, as Bees cast
their Swarms, to seek Place to dwell in,
and by the force of their Arms, to make
Room for themselves in warmer Climates,
and move in a more fruitful Soil. Thus
the <HI>Alani,</HI> the <HI>Gauls,</HI> the <HI>Hunns,</HI> invaded
<HI>Italy;</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> overrun <HI>Spain;</HI> the <HI>Van∣dals,
Spain</HI> and the Northern Parts of
<HI>Africa;</HI> the <HI>Thracians, Natolia</HI> and <HI>Ma∣cedonia,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>BUT in our Times, the Case alters uni∣versally,
the Art of War is so well study'd,
and so equally known in all Places, that 'tis
the longest Purse that conquers now, not the
longest Sword. If there is any Country
whose People are less martial, less enter∣prising,
and less able for the Field; yet, if
they have but more Money than their
Neighbours, they shall soon be superior to
them in Strength, for Money is Power,
and they that have the <HI>Gelt,</HI> (as the <HI>Dutch</HI>
call it) may have Armies of the best Troops
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and Generals of the greatest
<PB N="53" REF="81"/>
Experience to fight for them at the short∣est
Warning imaginable; thus upon sudden
Quarrels, Princes and States do not now
go Home and raise Armies, and list Men,
but they go Home and raise Money; and
that being done, they look abroad to hire
Armies, and, hire Men, and even to enter∣tain
Generals; so that they need never
bring any new raised Troops into the Field,
but old <HI>Veteran</HI> experience'd Soldiers, such
as <HI>Swiss, Germans,</HI> &amp;c. well Officer'd,
and led on by the greatest Generals in the
World; so that War is made in a trice, and
decisive Battles are fought now in shorter
Time than Troops in former Times could
be brought into the Field.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Venetians</HI> have had their Ge∣nerals
<HI>Shuylenbergh, Coningsmark, Baden,
&amp;c.</HI> to lead their Troops; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had their Marquis <HI>de Lede;</HI> the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
their Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> their Generals <HI>Gordon,
Konningseck,</HI> &amp;c. and Armies of <HI>Danes,
Prussians, Lunenbergers, Saxons, Hessi∣ans,</HI>
and <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and other <HI>Germans,</HI>
besides <HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>Grisons,</HI> are to be hired
for Money, alternately to fight, for now
one Side, than another; I say, <HI>alternately,</HI>
as the Persons direct them whose Money
they take; without Regard to Parties or
Interests, either of Politicks or Religion,
tho' whether for or against the Party or
Religion they profess; to Day for Papist,
<PB N="54" REF="82"/>
to Morrow for Protestant; be it for God
or for <HI>Baal,</HI> as they're hired, they go
<Q>And always fight according as they're
paid.</Q></P>
<P>THUS Money raises Armies, and Trade
raises Money; and so it may be truly said
of Trade, that it makes Princes powerful,
Nations valiant, and the most effeminate
People that can't fight for themselves, if
they have but Money, and can hire other
People to fight for them, they become as
formidable as any of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>SEEING Trade then is the Fund of
Wealth and Power, we cannot wonder that
we see the wisest Princes and States an∣xious
and concerned for the Encrease of the
Commerce and Trade of their Subjects,
and of the Growth of the Country; an∣xious
to propagate the Sale of such Goods
as are the Manufacture of their own Sub∣jects,
and that employs their own People;
especially, of such as keep the Money of
their Dominions at Home, and on the con∣trary,
for prohibiting the Importation from
Abroad, of such Things as are the Product
of other Countries, and of the Labour of
other People, as which carry Money back
in Return, and not Merchandize in Ex∣change.</P>
<P>NOR can we wonder that we see such
Princes and States endeavouring to set up
<PB N="55" REF="83"/>
such Manufactures in their own Countries,
which they see are successfully and profita∣bly
carried on by their Neighbours, and to
endeavour to procure the Materials proper
for setting up those Manufactures by all
just and possible Methods from other Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>HENCE we cannot blame the <HI>French</HI>
or <HI>Germans</HI> for endeavouring to get over
the <HI>British</HI> Wool into their Hands, by the
help of which they may bring their People
to imitate our Manufactures, which are so
esteem'd in the World, as well as so gain∣full
at Home.</P>
<P>NOR can we blame any foreign Nation
for prohibiting the Use and Wearing of
our Manufacture, if they can either make
them at Home, or make any which they
can shift with in their stead.</P>
<P>THE Reason is plain; 'tis the Interest of
every Nation to encourage their own Trade,
to encourage those Manufactures that will
employ their own Subjects, consume their
own Growth of Provisions, as well as Ma∣terials
of Commerce, and such as will keep
their Money or Species at Home.</P>
<P>'TIS from this just Principle, that the
<HI>French</HI> prohibit the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manu∣facture,
and the <HI>English</HI> again prohibit or
impose a Tax equal to a Prohibition, on the
<HI>French</HI> Silks, Paper, Linen, and several others
of their Manufactures. 'Tis from the same
just Reason in Trade, that we prohibit the
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
wearing of <HI>East India</HI> wrought Silks,
painted Callicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we prohibit the
Importation of <HI>French</HI> Brandy, <HI>Brasil</HI> Su∣gars,
and <HI>Spanish</HI> Tobacco; and so of seve∣ral
other Things.</P>
<P>I remember a Story told me by a Gen∣tleman
who liv'd many Years in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
where as weak and sordid a Nation as the
<HI>Russians</HI> were, and how gross soever in their
Politicks; yet this Principle prevailed with
them, as the Result of meer Nature in
Trade: The Case was thus;</P>
<P>AN <HI>English</HI> Man who had lived long in
the City of <HI>Casan</HI> upon the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and was
it seems concern'd in the great Salt Mines
there, had observ'd with Regret, the great
vast Luggage Boats, as we might call them,
and which he call'd <HI>Ballatoons,</HI> carrying
Goods by the River from <HI>Astracan,</HI> and
from the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and perhaps from
<HI>Persia</HI> to <HI>Muscow;</HI> these Boats as the Re∣later
told me, carry'd a prodigious Burthen,
from 100 Ton, to near twice as much;
but were unwieldy, heavy, ungovern'd
Things, and requir'd as they might well
do, a great many Hands to guide, and per∣haps
to tow them up against the Stream of
that mighty River, and the Distance being
above 1800 Miles too, they were in Pro∣portion
a long Time on the Voyage.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> Man fancy'd with himself,
that he could contrive a kind of Vessel,
that tho' it should not carry quite so much
<PB N="57" REF="85"/>
Burthen, should yet carry near 100 Ton,
and should, by the help of Sails and good
Management, perform the Voyage in much
shorter Time, and with much fewer
People.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THOSE Ballatoons it seems had
each 100 to 110 or 120 Men em∣ploy'd
in them to drag them along;
and the <HI>English</HI> Man proposed to do
the same Work with 18 or 20 Men,
and perform the Voyage in about one
third of the Time.</P>
<P>BIG with this Project, and expecting to be
very well accepted at Court, and rewarded
too, away goes the <HI>English</HI> Man to <HI>Moscow,</HI>
where after some Attendance, and making
known to some of the Boyars and great
Men, that he had a Proposal to make to
the Great Duke, that would be very much
to the Advantage of their Country, and for
the Advantage of the capital City, and the
like, he obtained Audience, and lay'd the
whole Scheme before his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE Grand Duke, for they did not then
call him Emperor, took the Thing very
readily, and at the second and third Au∣dience,
called him to him, and began to
question him about several Particulars, but
chiefly this: How many Men were employ∣ed
in these Boats before? And the <HI>English</HI>
Man answer'd, 120.</P>
<P>AND how many will you perform it
with says the Grand Duke.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="86"/>
EIGHTEEN or twenty Men at most,
says the Projector.</P>
<P>AND how long Time are my Subjects
performing the Voyage now? Says his
<HI>Russian</HI> Majesty.</P>
<P>ABOUT four or five Months, says the
<HI>English</HI> Man.</P>
<P>AND how long will you perform it in?
Says his Majesty.</P>
<P>IN about two Months, says the <HI>English</HI>
Man.</P>
<P>UPON this the Great Duke stop'd, and
look'd angrily; but seem'd to be musing,
as if he was calculating the Thing; after
some Pause, he turns to the <HI>English</HI> Man,
And what Country Man are you? Says
his Ducal Majesty.</P>
<P>AN <HI>English</HI> Man, says the Projector.</P>
<P>VERY well says his Majesty, 'tis well for
you, that you are not one of my Subjects;
do you come hither to set up Projects, to
starve my People? Get you gone forthwith,
and with the utmost Expedition out of
my Dominions upon pain of Death: You
perform that Work with eighteen Men,
which now one hundred and twenty Men
are employ'd, and get their Bread by!
What must the hundred and two Men do,
that are to be turn'd out of their Business!
Must they perish and be starv'd for want of
Employment! Get you gone, adds his Ma∣jesty,
and see my Court no more; and im∣mediately
gave Orders for having him car∣ry'd
<PB N="59" REF="87"/>
away directly to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> on the
Frontiers of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> towards <HI>Livonia</HI> and
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Dominions, lest he should pro∣pagate
such dangerous Inventions, as should
lessen the Employment and Labour of his
Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Folly of this Conduct makes a kind
of Jest upon the People of <HI>Moscow;</HI> but
the Moral of the Fable, be it so or not, is
good; 'tis certainly the Wealth and Felicity
of a Nation, to have the People fully em∣ploy'd
for Wages, let that Wages be what
it will.</P>
<P>BY the same Rule, those Nations are the
richest and wealthiest, as well in general
as in particular, where the Labour of the
People, without Injury to the Government,
brings the most Money for their Work.</P>
<P>IT is certainly a wrong Maxim which
some People dogmatize so very much upon,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it is the general Interest of this
Nation to reduce the Price of their Manu∣facture.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are some old Noti∣ons
which chime in with this Piece of tra∣ding
Policy, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapness causes
Consumption; and that by underselling o∣ther
Nations, we shall carry away the Trade
from them; and there is something popular
in the Notion too: But it will not hold
in all Cases, and particularly not in our
Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="88"/>
FIRST, I insist, that if you would re∣duce
the Price of our Manufacture, by re∣ducing
the Wages of the Poor, who are
the Workers or Manufacturers, it is not
possible but that you will reduce the Value
and Goodness of the Manufacture.</P>
<P>IF you expect the Poor should work
cheaper, and not perform their Work slight∣er
and more overly, as we call it, and super∣ficially,
you expect what is not in the Na∣ture
of the Thing.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if you lower the Wages of the
Poor, you must of Course sink the Rate of
Provisions, and that of Course will sink the
Value of Lands, and so you wound the
Capital at once; for the Poor cannot earn
little and spend much, the End of that is,
starving and misery; the Rate of Provisions
will follow the Rate of Wages, there is no
possibility of its being otherwise; it has
ever been so, and ever will be so, the Na∣ture
of the Thing requires it.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is beginning at the wrong
End of Trade; but the true Way is, keep
up the Goodness of your Manufacture, so
as to make it excel in Quality, and its ex∣ceeding
in Price will be no Deficiency in
Trade.</P>
<P>THINGS are not dear or cheap, accord∣ing
as they sell for more or less; but accord∣ing
as the Price they sell for, bears a Pro∣portion
to the goodness or meanness of the
Goods sold. A high priz'd Manufacture
<PB N="61" REF="89"/>
may be as cheap, as a low priz'd Manufac∣ture
of the same Kind, according to the
well or ill performing and finishing the
Work; as a fine Piece of Painting may be
cheaper than a coarser Piece of the same
Dimensions, in Proportion to the Goodness
of its Workmanship; tho' one should be
sold for one hundred Guineas, and the other
for one hundred Shillings.</P>
<P>LET your Manufacture gain the Credit
of the best in the World of its Kind, it
shall accordingly bear the best Price of any
in the World, and yet be cheap too; that
is, it shall be cheap of the Price, tho' not
under Price.</P>
<P>I shall speak more of this in its Place;
'tis only hinted superficially here, to argue
the great Advantage to a Nation, of having
such an Employment for their Poor, as
may make them not live only, but live
comfortably. The poor <HI>Muscovite</HI> Wretch∣es
who mann'd the Ballatoon with one
hundred and twenty Men, liv'd on that
Employ; that is to say, they did not im∣mediately
perish; but the Truth is, they
might be said to starve at it, not live at it.</P>
<P>BUT our labouring Poor really live, keep
Families, pay Taxes, Scot and Lot, as we
call it, wear good Cloths, eat the Fat, and
drink the Sweet; and yet, labour hard too.
And this is not only the Glory of Trade
in general, but of our Manufacture in par∣ticular;
nay, and is the Support of the
<PB N="62" REF="90"/>
Manufacture too; for by this means, the
Manufacture is kept up to its Price at Mar∣ket;
the Goodness being kept up at Home,
the Credit of it is kept up Abroad, and one
reciprocally is the Life of the other; the
Wages support the Manufacture, and the
Manufacture supports the Wages; by the
good Pay, the Weaver and all his Depen∣dent
Tradesmen are encourag'd to make
the Wares good, by the Goodness their
Credit Abroad is kept up, by the Credit
the Price, and by that Price the Wages;
<HI>one Hand</HI> washes <HI>t'other Hand,</HI> and both
the <HI>Hands</HI> the <HI>Face.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE I insist also, that our Manufac∣ture
is the cheapest in the World, because
it is the best; and our Poor work as cheap
as any Poor in <HI>Europe,</HI> because their Work
is best perform'd: And this I shall prove
more particularly as I go on.</P>
<P>LET us therefore cease those narrow No∣tions
in Commerce, or at least lay less
Stress upon them; that Cheapness causes
Consumption, may be allow'd in many
Things; but 'tis not a Rule without Ex∣ception,
nor a Foundation to build upon in
every Case; it is true, in the Consumption
of Trash, and in the Consumption of Eat∣ables
and Drinkables: If good Wine was
to be sold at six Pence a Quart, instead of
two Shillings, or at three Pence a Pot, as
strong Beer, there would be much more
Wine drank than is now; but in Things of
<PB N="63" REF="91"/>
Substance, weighty and durable, the Case
many times alters, and it is a true old Pro∣verb,
<HI>the best is best cheap.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER is it true in every Article, that
the Consumption of Quantity is the Pros∣perity
of Trade, unless it be also true, that
some Gain is made by the Trade: For
Example, when our Gold Coin in <HI>England,</HI>
was with the greatest Infatuation imagina∣ble,
advanc'd from twenty one Shillings and
six Pence, to thirty Shillings each Guinea,
the same Price being not in Proportion
raised in foreign Countries, the <HI>Dutch,
Germans, French,</HI> and <HI>Portugueze,</HI> hurry'd
over their Gold hither, coin'd it at forty
<HI>per Cent.</HI> Profit, and immediately vested it
in our Produce and Manufacture. Had
they gone on thus, and bought all the
Woollen Goods, Corn, Tin, Lead, wrought
Iron and Brass, Sugar and Tobacco in
<HI>England,</HI> as they would soon ha' done
wich Gold at six Pound an Ounce, that
Consumption of Quantity would ha' ruin'd
the whole Commerce; for they would
have stagnated all our Markets Abroad, be∣ing
able to sell twenty or thirty <HI>per Cent.</HI>
cheaper than the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, they
would in short have carried away all our
Quantity, and lest us full of Gold, at a
third of Price more than it was worth.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; neither may the carry∣ing
of the Quantity of our Goods be always
a Benefit, if the Price should be reduc'd be∣low
<PB N="64" REF="92"/>
low the Standard of our Trade: By the
Standard of our Trade, I mean, the stated
ordinary Rate of the Poors Labour. What
Benefit is a great Consumption of your
Goods, at a Rate with which the Mer∣chant
cannot gain, and the Maker cannot
live? There is no Question, but you may
sell all the woollen Manufacture at this
Time in the Nation, in three Months
Time, if you will give them at an Abate∣ment
of twenty to thirty per Cent, upon
the Value; and so the Cheapness will cer∣tainly
cause the Consumption.</P>
<P>But what Gain would this be to the
Commerce, and what Advantage to the
Trade in general? Since you cannot re∣place
the Quantity at that Price, and you
cannot hold the Trade upon that Foot
without falling into Circumstances as rui∣nous
to Trade, as want of a Market;
namely, the finking Wages, sinking Provi∣sions,
and sinking Land; which, in a word,
is a <HI>sinking Fund</HI> in the literal Sense.</P>
<P>A much better Way to support Trade,
is to sink your Quantity at Home, pro∣portioning
the Quantity to the Consump∣tion,
if you cannot proportion the Con∣sumption
to the Quantity; and you had
much better have tome of your People
want Work, and seek Employment some
other Way, than to have all Hands at
Work to no Profit: Of which also I shall
speak fully and at large in its Order.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="93"/>
Upon the whole, I insist, and doubt not
to make it appear, (without any Impeach∣ment
of the old popular Notion, of Cheap∣ness
causing Consumption;) That it is the
true Interest of any Trading People to keep
lip the Value, I mean the intrinsic Goodness
of their Manufactures, to their just Standard;
and make them cheap by their real Worth,
rather than by meer lowering the Price at
the Expence of their Credit, and meerly to
bring them to a low Rate at the Market.</P>
<P>I insist, that this keeping up the Cre∣dit
of a Manufacture, by its intrinsic
Worth, is the only Prosperity of a nation∣al
Production, by which the People that
make it are enrich'd, and the Nation they
live in made prosperous and powerful.</P>
<P>IT is apparent in the Manufactures of
<HI>China, India</HI> and other Eastern Countries,
they have, it is true, the most extended Ma∣nufacture,
and the greatest Variety in the
World; and their Manufactures push them∣selves
upon the World, by the meer Stress
of their Cheapness, which according to the
Principle mentioned above, causes their
Consumption.</P>
<P>BUT then look back to the Country or
Countries from whence they come, and
there you see the Consequence most evi∣dent;
the People who make all these sine
Works are to the lair Degree miserable, their
Labour of no Value, their Wages would
fright us to talk of it, and their way of Li∣ving
<PB N="66" REF="94"/>
raise a Horror in us to think of it:
Their Women draw the Plough instead of
Horses; their Men perish and sink under the
Weight of their heavier Labour, because the
Food they eat is not of sufficient Nourish∣ment
to support them, and the Wages they
get cannot provide better Food for them;
and yet their rigorous Task-masters lash them
forward as we (cruelly too) sometimes do
our Horses.</P>
<P>MONS. <HI>Niuenhoff</HI> in his Description of
<HI>China</HI> gives such an Account of the Misery of
the poor People dragging, or as we call it, tow∣ing
the Boats up the Stream of the royal Canal
there, the greatest in the World; and how
their Drivers, like our Carters, whip them
on till the poor exhausted Creatures drop
down and die under the Labour of it: I
say, he gives such an Account as would
make the Heart of a merciful Man bleed to
think of it; and the utmost of their Wages
for all this Labour does not, as I can calcu∣late
it, amount to so much as 2 <HI>d.</HI> a Day
<HI>Sterling</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and the like no doubt
is the Case in their Manufacture in Pro∣portion.</P>
<P>IF then these Gentlemen, who are for
forcing the Consumption of our Manufac∣ture
in <HI>England,</HI> (or in any of those Coun∣tries
in <HI>Europe</HI> where they work cheapest,)
by their meer Cheapness, are content to re∣duce
the Wages of the People that make
them, to the Rate of those in <HI>China</HI> or in
<PB N="67" REF="95"/>
<HI>India,</HI> there is no doubt they might en∣crease
the Consumption, and sell off the
Quantity; but what would be the Advan∣tage?
They would sell their Goods and ruin
their People; the Benefit of which in the
Gross, I confess I do not understand.</P>
<P>I shall speak of all this again, as it more
particularly relates to our Commerce in
<HI>England;</HI> and therefore I only mention it
here, as this Notion of reducing the Price
of the Manufacture is received, for a ge∣neral
Principle in Commerce, and apply'd
by Mistake to particular Cases.</P>
<P>THERE is an Exception in the Article of
Wages, which may be brought here against
what I have advanc'd above as to <HI>England,</HI>
viz. that we give the highest Wages to our
Poor, of any Nation in the World; and
it may be thought I have either for∣got,
or am ignorant of the high Wages
given in the <HI>European</HI> Colonies in Ame∣rica
as well <HI>English,</HI> as <HI>French, Spanish, &amp;c.</HI>
where a Piece of Eight, or rather five
Shillings, and in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> six to seven
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Day, is given to Handicrafts,
and labouring People for their Work; and
where the Price of Slaves is risen within
these few Years, from twenty Pound a
Head, to thirty and forty Pound, on the
meer Account of the Dearness of Wages.</P>
<P>But this is explain'd, and fully answer∣ed
in few Words; namely, that the Dear∣ness
of Wages there, is occasioned by two
<PB N="66" REF="96"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="67" REF="97"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="68" REF="98"/>
Things, <HI>viz.</HI> the Dearness of Provisions,
and the want of People; the Dearness of
Provisions in the Islands, and the want
of People in the Colonies on the Conti∣nent;
and let any Man of Experience cal∣culate
the Proportion of those Things,
and he will find that in a due Equality or
Proportion to the Dearness of Living, the
Wages are as cheap there as here, and in
some Articles rather cheaper; the parti∣cular
Examination of it, I refer to its pro∣per
Place.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, to sum it up in a few
Words, Trade is the Wealth of the World;
Trade makes the Difference as to Rich
or Poor, between one Nation and another;
Trade nourishes Industry, and Industry
begets Trade; Trade disperses the natural
Wealth of the World, and Trade raises
new Species of Wealth, which Nature
knew nothing of: Trade has two Daugh∣ters,
whose fruitful Progeny in Arts may
be laid to employ Mankind; namely,
<Q>MANUFACTURE
And
NAVIGATION.</Q></P>
<P>SEE how they unite their Powers to do
good to the World, and to teach Men
how to live happy and comfortably; let us
ice, I say, how these two join, and that
in the only Means of living comfortably,
<PB N="69" REF="99"/>
I mean Diligence, for a Life of Sloth and
Idleness, is not Happiness or Comfort;
Employment is Life, Sloth and Indolence
is Death; to be busy, is to be chearful, to
be pleasant; to have nothing to do, is all
Dejection, dispiriting, and in a word, to be
fit for nothing but Mischief and the Devil.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURE supplies Merchandize.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION supplies Shipping.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURE is the Hospital which
feeds the Poor.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION is the Nursery which rai∣ses
Seamen.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURE commands Money from
Abroad.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION brings it Home.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURE loads the Ships out.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION loads them in.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURE is Wealth.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION is Strength.</P>
<P>TO conclude, Manufacture for Employ∣ment
at Home, and Navigation for Em∣ployment
Abroad, both together, seem to
let all the busy World at Work; they seem
to joyn Hands to encourage the industrious
Nations, and if well managed, infallibly
make the World rich.</P>

meerly of <HI>England</HI> abstracted; limited to
its geographical Dimensions, and that little
Spot within the Lines of its Situation, as it
appears on the Surface of the Globe, which
is little indeed.</P>
<P>BUT I am to he understood in the Lan∣guage
of Trade; and so the Trade, of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
is the Trade of all the Places within
the Dominions of <HI>England;</HI> or, as it is usu∣ally
<PB N="71" REF="101"/>
express'd, the Countries subject to the
<HI>English</HI> Government.</P>
<P>I am not at all fond of that modern as∣sum'd
Stile, by which some Authors think
they do us an Honour, when they call
the extended scattered Colonies and Do∣minions
of the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Nation,
<HI>the English Empire:</HI> I don't think they
do His Majesty or the <HI>English</HI> Nation any
Honour at all by it; 'tis enough the King
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has the Opulence of an
Emperor, without affecting or at all valu∣ing
the Title.</P>
<P>NOT but that as the Humour of the
World goes, I believe in a few Ages more
all Degrees of Men, or at least many of
them, will advance their Plumes, and
cock their Feathers, in proportion as their
Pride increases, in all the Nations about us,
and that as the Counts and Princes are in∣creased
in several Nations already, even to
a Scandal; so they will go on.</P>
<P>THUS in Time the Counts may be Dukes,
the Dukes Princes, the Princes be Kings,
and the Kings Emperors; in a Word, 'tis
not improper, as we are talking of Trade,
to observe how Honour is become a Mer∣chandize,
Nobility grows cheap, and Dig∣nities
come to Market upon easy Terms in
the World; and what with the Church
Politicks on one Hand, and State Politicks
on the other, the World may in a few
Years be overrun, not with real Honours,
<PB N="72" REF="102"/>
but with Titles. Honour blooms and runs
to Seed; (I mean Abroad, not in <HI>England</HI>)
and Titles without Merit are the Scandal
of the World. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT I return, The Trade of <HI>England, I
say,</HI> is the Trade of the <HI>English</HI> Dominions,
the Commerce of the Countries subject
to the <HI>English</HI> Government, particularly,
<HI>1st,</HI> The Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land.</HI>
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> The Trade of the <HI>English</HI>
Colonies and Factories in <HI>America, Asia,</HI>
and <HI>Africa;</HI> These all put together, make
the Trade of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I come to speak of the general
Commerce of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> in
other Countries, where they are said to
trade as Merchants, not to be possest of
the Country in Sovereignty; that is quite
another Thing, and will be discoursed of in
another Manner, for we must always di∣stinguish
between the Trade of a Country,
and the Dealings of the People, by Corre∣spondence
in other Countries; and I shall
take Care to preserve that Distinction, as
Justice requires, on all Occasions as we
go on.</P>
<P>THE Trade of <HI>England</HI> is one Thing,
the Trade of the <HI>English People</HI> is another;
the first is confin'd to the Place, the second
is carried on by the Persons; however, and
wherever they may be scattered, removed,
and by Industry settled, as Occasion di∣rects,
<PB N="73" REF="103"/>
in any or every Part and Country of
the known World.</P>
<P>IT is true the Greatness and Opulence
of the <HI>English,</HI> as a trading Nation, is very
conspicuous on this very Account, <HI>viz.</HI>
that not only the Merchandize, but the
Merchants also of our Nation, are found
in all the trading Parts and Ports of the
known World; and which is still more,
they are placed there, and supported by the
Strength of their own Stocks, and the
Value of the Merchandizes they carry
thither, more than of the Goods they buy
there.</P>
<P>IN some parts of the World, indeed, they
seem to be settled and employed rather <HI>to
buy,</HI> than <HI>to sell;</HI> as in the several Factories
and trading Ports of <HI>India,</HI> at <HI>Mocha,</HI> at
<HI>Suratte,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> and all the
Coasts of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> but in most of
the other Parts of the World, we rather
<HI>sell</HI> than <HI>buy;</HI> at least we trade equally both
Ways, to the great Advantage of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Commerce in general, and of the Mer∣chants
in particular; as in <HI>Turky, Italy,
Spain,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the
Kingdom of <HI>Portugal;</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>German,</HI> and the <HI>Danish</HI> Coasts, the <HI>Bal∣tick,</HI>
and <HI>Northern</HI> Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN all these Countries, the Growth and
Product of our Lands and Seas, as mentio∣ned
already, and the Labour and Manu∣facture
of our People are the principal
<PB N="74" REF="104"/>
Subject of our Merchants Business; and
what <HI>they buy</HI> in those Countries is the
Return only, or rather in Part of the Re∣turn
for those Goods, which to our great
Advantage they first carried thither, and
sold in those Markets; the Overplus or
Ballance being made good, according to
the Nature of Things, and of the Country,
several Ways; some by Exchanges, some
in Specie, some directly, some from one
Country to another, as we shall see in its
Place.</P>
<P>BUT the Trade of <HI>England</HI> in particular,
as distinguish'd above, and as we are to
speak of it under the Title <HI>of the English
Commerce,</HI> is contain'd in these Generals.</P>
<P>1. THE Product and Manufacture of
the Country, for Exportation into foreign
Parts only.</P>
<P>2. THE Shipping and Navigation.</P>
<P>3. THE Home Consumption of our own
Goods, and foreign Importations.</P>
<P>4. THE Employment of the People in
Consequence of all these, and in the parti∣cular
Works for the Management of them.</P>
<P>UNDER these four Heads, what an im∣mense
Weight of Business is carried on, or,
as it is ordinarily express'd, is managed in
this Kingdom? How many Millions of
People are kept in constant Motion, Men,
Women, and Children employ'd, Infants
(so they may properly be called) of five,
six and seven Years of Age, made capable
<PB N="75" REF="105"/>
of getting their own Bread, and subsisting
by the Labour of their own Hands, and a
prodigious Wealth, accumulated among
the common People? insomuch, that if
it were cast up together, the Poor, that is
to say, such as were formerly counted a∣mong
the Poor, I mean the Tradesmen,
the Shopkeeping, trading and labouring
Part of the People, have more real movable
Wealth among them, than all the Gentry
and Nobility in the whole Kingdom, not
reckoning the real Estates in Lands, Tene∣ments,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which they possess a sur∣prizing
Share also.</P>
<P>AND here it is worth our making a Stop,
and reflecting a little on a most conside∣rable
Incident, in the <HI>English</HI> Trade, and
which is to be parallel'd in no Place
that I know of in the World; namely that
the Fund of our Trade in <HI>England</HI> is raised
wholly within it self; it is a Kind of Pecu∣liar
to us, that all our Commerce is deriv'd
from our selves: It is not so in other Nati∣ions;
the Trade of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> is all exo∣tick;
it consists in meer Buying and Selling,
Fetching and Carrying, and they export
little or nothing, but what they first im∣port;
even the Linnen which they are laid
to make, they import most of the Yarn (for
it) from <HI>Silesia</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the Flax
for the rest from <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> buy to sell, the <HI>English</HI>
plant, dig, sheer, and weave to sell; not
<PB N="76" REF="106"/>
only our Manufactures are our own, but
almost all the Materials of them are our
own; I say almost, because there are some
Exceptions, but they are not many.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of Wool, all the
Materials are our own, but the Oyl, and
some dye Stuffs, such as the Galls, the In∣digo,
the Cocheneal, and a few others; as
to <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool, it is an Extra, 'tis a
Step out of the ordinary Way; most of our
Manufactures are, <HI>and might be,</HI> made with∣out
it.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of <HI>Hard Ware,</HI> the
Tin, the Lead, is our own; the Copper,
and Iron are our own, except a part of the
Iron from <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and but a part:
For in the Gross, and in all our Founda∣ries
of Iron, the Metal is our own.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of Silk, it is true, the
grand and fundamental Materials are foreign.
But then, 1. The Silk Manufactures are but
of late called our own; it is an Improve∣ment,
and it is within the Reach of our
Memory, that we bought all our wrought
Silks, a few Ribbands excepted, from Abroad,
to the Value of near two Millions a Year;
and it may not be long before an improving
Nation, as we are, may raise the Silk at Home
too, or at least in our Colonies, as well as
other Countries have done, which had none
before, <HI>viz. France, Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> For 'tis
well known, that <HI>Italy</HI> at first, and <HI>France</HI>
but lately, had no Silk of their own, but
<PB N="77" REF="107"/>
brought it all from <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>India:</HI> As to
our Product for Exportation, 'tis all our
own, or of our Colonies, which is the same
thing, such as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Corn,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Coal,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Salt,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Malt,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Tin,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lead,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fish,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Drugs,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Copperas,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rice,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Alloms,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sugar,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Tobacco,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Peltry (Furs,)</ITEM>
<ITEM>Flesh</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cotton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Melasses,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ginger,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Indigo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE as Exportations, being all our
own, and being in themselves so vastly
great, are the Fund of our Wealth, and
the Encrease of our Numbers.</P>
<P>A People numerous and rich, necessarily
make a great Home Consumption, as well
of their own Growth, as of foreign Impor∣tations:
And this is the Sum of the <HI>English</HI>
Trade.</P>
<P>IT is no Boast, much less is it assuming
to say, that we consume at Home the grea∣test
Quantity of Foreign Product, but the
least of Foreign Manufacture of any tra∣ding
Nation in the World; the only foreign
Manufactures we may be said to import
wholly, is Linen and Paper, and Tin Plates;
and yet those not wholly neither, tho' 'tis
acknowledged they are chiefly imported.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> imports the Manufactures of other
Countries more than we, but very little of
their Growth and Produce, except Fish;
the like is said of <HI>France,</HI> tho' they have
<PB N="78" REF="108"/>
now so great a Share of Manufacture of
their own.</P>
<P>WE import Gold, Silver, Wine, Brandy,
Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Flax, Wax, Oyl, Iron,
Steel, Fruit, Wool, Silk, Hair, Drugs, Dye
Suffs, Salt-Peter, Tea, Coffee, Timber, Spice:
All these and many more. But these are all
the <HI>Growth</HI> and <HI>Produce</HI> of the Lands, not
the Manufacture and Workmanship of fo∣reign
Countries: And all these we consume
at Home in such Quantities, as are not to be
equalled in any other Country.</P>
<P>But of the Manufacture of other Coun∣tries,
we import very little, Linen ex∣cepted,
Paper and Tin-Plates; and of all
these, except Tin-Plates we make now great
Quantities at Home also: The Consump∣tion
of Wine and Linen in <HI>England</HI> is pro∣digious,
and we import more than any single
Nation in the World, notwithstanding a
very great Quantity of the first made at Home
especially in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> as for
East <HI>India</HI> Manufactures, the Quantity now
consum'd in <HI>England</HI> is small, and those that
are, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Callicoes</HI> may be esteem'd as
Linen, being of the same Species as to their
Use.</P>
<P>BUT to bring it back to the first Head as
a Trade, the Trade of <HI>England</HI> consists then
in short,
<Q><PB N="79" REF="109"/>
Of the greatest Inland Pro∣duction
Exported, and the
greatest foreign Production
imported
of any Na∣tion
in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Exportation lays in a Stock of
Wealth from Abroad, multiplies and en∣riches
our People, and our People in gene∣ral
being in good Circumstances, I mean the
middling, trading, and industrious People,
living tolerably well, their well-faring gives
Occasion to the vast Consumption of the
foreign, as well as home Produce, the like
of which is not to be equalled by any Nation
in the World; the Particulars we shall en∣quire
into in their Order.</P>
<P>HOW far the Multitudes of our People
are encreased by these very Articles, and
that to such a Degree as is scarce conceiv∣able,
is worth our Enquiry, were it not too
tedious for this Place. What populous Towns
are rais'd by our Manufactures, from within
few Years! how are our Towns built into
Cities, and small Villages (hardly known in
ancient Times) grown up into populous
Towns! Let any one that is curious in such.
Observations, take notice of the manufactu∣ring
Counties
and Towns, the Sea Ports,
and the Coast Counties, and compare
them with the Counties where there are
no Manufactures carried on, and where
there being no part of the Land bordering
<PB N="80" REF="110"/>
on the Sea, the Encrease of Trade could
not have that immediate Influence on them;
and let them but observe the Difference be∣tween
these in the Numbers of great and
populous Towns, the Throngs and Multi∣tudes
of People, and the still encreasing
Greatness of the Towns that were larger
before.</P>
<P>LET them see how the People gather
about the Manufacture, how they crowd
into the clothing Countries, however barren
and remote: And on the contrary, how
thin of Inhabitants, compared to those po∣pulous
Parts, tho' otherwise populous too,
are the other Parts of the Country; some of
which are much more fruitful and fertile,
the Soil richer, the Situation more agree∣able,
and the Air milder and wholsomer
than those that are so populous? But where
the Trade is, there are the People, there
the Wealth, there the great Markets, and the
large Towns; and in a Word, there the ready
Money: For it is the Trade that has made
the common People rich, as Pride has made
the Gentry poor.</P>
<P>WELL might I say, as in the foregoing
Chapter, That it is a Scandal upon the Un∣derstanding
of the Gentry, to think con∣temptibly
of the trading part of the Nation;
seeing however the Gentlemen may value
themselves upon their Birth and Blood, the
Case begins to turn against them so evi∣dently,
as to Fortune and Estate, that tho'
<PB N="81" REF="111"/>
they say, the Tradesmen cannot be made
Gentlemen; yet the Tradesmen are, at this
Time, able to buy the Gentlemen almost in
every part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND let me add, were it not for two
Articles, by which the Numbers of the Fa∣milies
of Gentlemen are recruited when
lessened by Fate and Folly, and restored
when sunk and decayed, and both by Trade,
this Nation would, in a few Years, have
very few Families of Gentlemen left; or,
at least, very few that had Estates to sup∣port
them.</P>
<P>1. THE ancient Families, who having
wasted and exhausted their Estates, and be∣ing
declin'd and decay'd in Fortune by
Luxury and high Living, have restor'd and
rais'd themselves again, by mixing Blood
with the despis'd Tradesmen, marrying the
Daughters of such Tradesmen, as being o∣vergrown
in Wealth, have been oblig'd, for
want of Sons, to leave their Estates to their
Female Issue; we find innumerable Families
not of Gentlemen only, but even of the No∣bility
of the highest Rank, have restor'd
their Fortunes by such Heiresses, and by such
Matches, to the Degree of 50, to 100 and
150 Thousand Pounds at a Time.</P>
<P>2. AS thus the decay'd Estates of the
Nobility and Gentry have been restored,
and their Family Wounds heal'd by the
Daughters of the richer Tradesmen; so on
<PB N="82" REF="112"/>
the other Hand, by the Tradesmen them∣selves,
or by their Sons, the Numbers of
the Families of the Gentry have been
recruited, when sunk quite out of Rank,
and lost in Poverty and Distress:</P>
<P>FAMILIES are as effectually extinct,
and lost, and as much forgotten, when
the Heirs are left in Misery and Po∣verty,
and the Estate sold from them,
as if they were sunk into the Grave. I
could instance at this Time, in a Family,
who once flourish'd within a few Miles of
this City, the eldest Son a Baronet with∣out
Bread, wears a red Coat without a
Commission, and goes in a disguised Name,
that he may not have a SIR tack'd upon his
Rags, and have his Honour be an Additi∣on
to his Misery: The Children that are
young, are kept upon Charity, and the
grown Daughters go to Service, from a
Coach and four Horses.</P>
<P>THE Estate (of one thousand eight hun∣dred
Pound <HI>per Annum</HI>) is purchased by a
Citizen, who having got the Money by
honest Industry, and persuing a prosperous
Trade, has left his Books and his Ware∣houses
to his two younger Sons, is retir'd
from the World, lives upon the Estate, is
a Justice of Peace, and makes a compleat
Gentleman: His eldest Son bred at the
University, and thoroughly accomplish'd,
is as well receiv'd among the Gentry in
the County, and upon the valuable Fund
<PB N="83" REF="113"/>
of his true Merit, as if he had been a Gen∣tleman
by Blood for a hundred Generati∣ons
before the Conquest.</P>
<P>I might add here, that it would be worth
the while for those Gentlemen, who talk so
much of their antient Family Merit, and
look so little at preserving the Stock, by
encreasing their own: I say, it would be
worth their while to look into the Roll
of our Gentry, and enquire what is be∣come
of the Estates of those prodigious
Numbers of lost and extinct Families,
which now even the Heralds themselves
can hardly find; let them tell us if those
Estates are not now purchased by Trades∣men
and Citizens, or the Posterity of such;
and whether those Tradesmens Posterity do
not now fill up the Vacancies, the Gaps,
and Chasmes in the great Roll or List of
Families, as well of the Gentry, as of the
Nobility themselves; and whether there
are many Families left, who have not been
either restored <HI>as in our first Head,</HI> or sup∣ply'd,
<HI>as in the second,</HI> by a Succession of
Wealth, and new Branches from the grow∣ing
Greatness of Trade.</P>
<P>TRADE, in a word, raises antient Fami∣lies
when sunk and decay'd: And plants
new Families, where the old ones are lost
and extinst.</P>
<P>I dare oblige my self to name five
hundred great Estates, within one hun∣dred
Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which within
<PB N="84" REF="114"/>
eighty Years past, were the Possessions
of the antient <HI>English</HI> Gentry, which are
now bought up, and in the Possession
of Citizens and Tradesmen, purchased fair∣ly
by Money raised in Trade; some by
Merchandizing, some by Shop-keeping,
and some by meer Manufacturing; such as
Clothing in particular, of which Sort,
notwithstanding all that is, or has been said
of the Decay of our Manufacture, it is not
difficult to find in the clothing and manu∣facturing
Countries of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> and <HI>Glou∣cestershire,</HI>
many, (very many) Clothiers,
worth forty to fifty thousand Pounds a
Man, and some of them worth from five
hundred to one thousand Pound <HI>per An∣num,</HI>
Estates in Land, besides their Stock
in Business; whose Posterity will never be
reproach'd with their being upstart Gen∣tlemen,
or be thought Mechanick, for be∣ing
of the Blood of a Clothier.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the populous Towns
rais'd by these Manufactures, let the curi∣ous
examine the great Towns of
<LIST>
<ITEM>Manchester,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Warrington,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Macclesfield,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hallifax,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Leeds,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wakefield,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sheffield,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Birmingham,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Froom,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Taunton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Tiverton,</ITEM>
</LIST>
and many others.</P>
<P>SOME of these are meer Villages; the
highest Magistrate in them is a Consiable,
<PB N="85" REF="115"/>
and few or no Families of Gentry among
them; yet they are full of Wealth, and
full of People, and daily encreasing in
both; all which is occasion'd by the meer
Strength of Trade, and the growing Ma∣nufactures
establish'd in them; and of eve∣ry
one of them it may be said, they have
severally more People in them, than the
City of <HI>York;</HI> besides that, (as I have said
above) they are all visibly and daily en∣creasing,
which <HI>York</HI> is not.</P>
<P>FROM these which are all Inland Towns,
let the same curious Enquirer cast his Eye
upon some of our Sea-Port Towns, where
Trade flourishes, as well foreign Trade,
as home Trade, and where Navigation,
Manufacturing, and Merchandize seem to
assist one another, and go Hand in Hand
to encrease both the Wealth and the Peo∣ple:
Few Cities in <HI>England, London</HI> and
<HI>Bristol</HI> excepted, can equal them; and in
Time, some of them bid fair to be superior
to even <HI>Bristol</HI> it self; such as
<LIST>
<ITEM>Yarmouth,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Leverpool,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Colchester,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Deal,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hull,</ITEM>
<ITEM>New-castle,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lyn,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Plymouth,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Whitehaven,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Biddeford,</ITEM>
</LIST>
and several others.</P>
<P>HOW are all these Towns raised by
Trade, and the Numbers of their Inhabi∣tants
drawn to them by the Employment,
and consequently the Money which Trade
<PB N="86" REF="116"/>
spreads and diffuses so liberally among the
People.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; let the curious En∣quirer
travel a little farther, and look into
the Countries adjacent to these Towns,
and there they will see a manifest Difference
in the very Face of Things, where the Ma∣nufactures
are settled and carry'd on; they
shall see the Villages stand thick, the Mar∣ket
Towns not only more in Number,
but larger, and fuller of Inhabitants; and
in short, the whole Country full of little
End-ships or Hamlets, and scattered Hou∣ses,
that it looks all like a planted Colony,
every where full of People, and the People
every where full of Business.</P>
<P>LET them view the County of <HI>Devon,</HI>
and for 20 Miles every Way round the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Excester,</HI> where the Trade of Serges
is carry'd on.</P>
<P>THE County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and for as ma∣ny
Miles every Way about the City of
<HI>Norwich,</HI> where the Stuff-weaving is car∣ry'd on.</P>
<P>THE County of <HI>Essex,</HI> for near 40
Miles every Way, where the Bay-making
Trade is carry'd on.</P>
<P>THE County of <HI>Wilts,</HI> thro' that whole
flourishing Vale, from <HI>Warminster</HI> South,
to <HI>Malmsbury</HI> North inclusive, and all the
great Towns of <HI>Bradford, Troubridge,
Westbury, Tedbury, Froom,</HI> and the <HI>De∣vizes,</HI>
&amp;c. where the Manufacture of fine
<PB N="87" REF="117"/>
<HI>Spanish,</HI> and Medley-Clothing, and Drug∣get
-making is carry'd on.</P>
<P>THE Counties of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Worces∣ter,</HI>
from <HI>Cirencester</HI> and <HI>Stroudwater,</HI> to
the City of <HI>Worcester,</HI> where the White-Clothing
Trade, for the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants
is carry'd on.</P>
<P>THE Counties of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Staf∣ford,</HI>
every Way round the Town of <HI>Bir∣mingham,</HI>
where the Hard-Ware Manu∣facture
and Cuttlery Trade is carry'd on;
as also about <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>
<P>THE Counties of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Lanca∣shire,</HI>
round about, and every Way adja∣cent
to the great Manufacturing Towns of
<HI>Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI>
where the known Manufactures of Cotton-ware,
Iron-ware, <HI>Yorkshire</HI>-Cloths, Ker∣sies,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are carry'd on.</P>
<P>IN all these, and many others which
might be mention'd, how infinitely popu∣lous
is the Country? <HI>not to say how rich;</HI>
how thick the Towns, how full the Mar∣kets,
how stor'd with People are the Vil∣lages,
and even the open Country! in so
much, that in the Parish or <HI>Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridge</HI> of
<HI>Hallifax</HI> alone, they reckon up sixteen
Chapels of Ease, and an hundred thou∣sand
Communicants, besides fourteen or
fifteen Meeting-houses, the People of all
which live at large, scatter'd and spread
over Hill and Dale, (for 'tis a mountainous
Country) as the Convenience of Water,

Coal, and other Things proper to their
Manufacture obliges them; so that the
whole Parish, which is a Circle of twelve
Miles diameter, is, as before, like a plant∣ed
Garden, or a Colony where every Fami∣ly
lives as it were within it self, and by it
self, for the propagating their Business;
and where, tho' the whole Country is in∣finitely
populous, yet, if you pass in the
middle of the Day thro' the Villages, and
by the straggling Houses on the Road, you
shall hardly see any Body to ask the Way
of: But if you go in the Evening, after wor∣king
Hours, you are surpriz'd at the Mul∣titude
of the People every where to be seen.</P>
<P>HAVING taken a View of these Countries,
let the same Person take a Tour through
those few Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where
Trade has the least Concern, and where
the Inhabitants consist chiefly of Landlord
and Tenant, the Gentry and Husbandmen;
and tho' there you see no want of need∣ful
People to cultivate the Ground, or to
dispatch the necessary Labours of the Place;
yet the Face of Things differs extremely,
and the following Particulars discover it.</P>
<P>1. THE Market Towns are few and small,
compar'd with such as I have nam'd, and
compar'd with the general Bulk of the
smaller Towns, not fit to rank with those
great ones nam'd; nay, the Villages in
those manufacturing Countries, are equal
to the Market Towns in these.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="119"/>
2. THE Villages are distant and remote,
small and thinly inhabited; and as for the
open Country, you see here and there a
Farm-house, and a Cottage indeed, but
nothing like the numerous Dwellings which
spread the enclosed Counties mention'd
above, and where the Roads as you travel
are like one continued Street, for some∣times
twenty or thirty Miles together, and
full of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>3. IN these unemploy'd Counties, you
see the Women and Children idle, and out
of Business; these sitting at their Doors, and
those playing in the Streets; even in the
Market Towns, and the most populous Vil∣lages,
where they might be supposed to
be employ'd, the Poor by the Rich, yet
there 'tis the same, much more in the
single scattering Villages, where they have
no Business but their own.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, in the manufacturing Coun∣ties,
you see the Wheel going almost at
every Door, the Wool and the Yarn hang∣ing
up at every Window; the Looms, the
Winders, the Combers, the Carders, the
Dyers, the Dressers, all busy; and the very
Children, as well as Women, constantly
employ'd.</P>
<P>4. AS is the Labour, so is the Living;
for where the Poor are full of Work,
they are never empty of Wages; they eat
while the others starve; and have a tole∣rable
Plenty; while in the unemploy'd
<PB N="90" REF="120"/>
Counties it goes very hard with them:
And whence is all this? Look to the
Lands, and consequently to the Estates of
the Gentry, the manufacturing Counties
are calculated for Business, the unemploy'd
Counties for Pleasure; the first are throng'd
with Villages and great Towns, the last
with Parks and great Forrests; the first are
stored with People, the last with Game; the
first are rich and fertil, the last waste and
barren; the diligent Part of the People are
fled to the first, the idler Part are left at the
last; in a Word, the rich and thriving
Tradesmen live in the first, the decaying
wasting Gentry in the last.</P>
<P>THE Product of the first, tho' improv'd
by Diligence and Application, is all consu∣med
among themselves; the Product of
the last, tho' not half what it might be, is
carried away for want of Money to the
Markets of the first; <HI>the first</HI> eat the Fat
and the Kernel of all, and enjoy the Soft, be∣ing
by their Diligence made able to buy it;
and <HI>the last</HI> eat the Husk, the course, and
the hard; pinch, and live miserable, being
without Employment, except meer Drudg∣ing,
and consequently without Money.</P>
<P>THE Reason of the Thing answers for
it self; a poor labouring Man that goes a∣broad
to his Day Work, and Husbandry,
Hedging, Ditching, Threshing, Carting,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and brings home his Week's Wages,
suppose at eight Pence to twelve Pence a
<PB N="91" REF="121"/>
Day, or in some Counties less; if he has
a Wife and three or four Children to feed,
and who get little or nothing for them∣selves,
must fare hard, and live poorly;
'tis easy to suppose it must be so.</P>
<P>BUT if this Man's Wife and Children
can at the same Time get Employment, if
at next Door, or at the next Village
there lives a Clothier, or a Bay Maker, or
a Stuff or Drugget Weaver; the Manu∣facturer
sends the poor Woman comb'd
Wool, or carded Wool every Week to
spin, and she gets eight Pence or nine
Pence a Day at home; the Weaver sends
for her two little Children, and they work
by the Loom, winding, filling Quills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and the two bigger Girls spin at home with
their Mother, and these earn three Pence
or four Pence a Day each: So that put it
together, the Family at Home gets as
much as the Father gets Abroad, and ge∣nerally
more.</P>
<P>THIS alters the Case extremely, the Fa∣mily
feels it, they all feed better, are
cloth'd warmer, and do not so easily nor
so often fall into Misery and Distress; the
Father gets them Food, and the Mother
gets them Clothes; and as they grow,
they do not run away to be Footmen and
Soldiers, Thieves and Beggars, or sell
themselves to the Plantations, to avoid
the Goal and the Gallows, but have a
<PB N="92" REF="122"/>
Trade at their Hands, and every one can
get their Bread.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I once went through a large po∣pulous
manufacturing Town in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and observ'd, that an Officer
planted there, with a Serjeant and two
Drums, had been beating up a long
Time, and could get no Recruits, ex∣cept
two or three Sots, who they had
drawn in to be drunk, and so listed
when they were not themselves, and
knew not what they did.</P>
<P>ENQUIRING the Reason of it, an
honest Clothier of the Town answe∣red
me effectually thus, <HI>The Case is
plain,</HI> says he, thus, there is at this
Time a brisk Demand for Goods, we
have 1100 Looms, <HI>added he,</HI> in this
Town, and the Villages about it, and
not one of them want Work; and
there is not a poor Child in the
Town of above four Years old, but
can earn his own Bread; besides, there
being so good a Trade at this Time,
causes us to advance Wages a little,
and the Weaver and the Spinner get
more than they used to do; and
while it is so, they may beat the Heads
of their Drums out, if they will,
they'll get no Soldiers here; but let
them come when Trade is dead, and
the People want Work, and they may
get Soldiers enough; the Gentleman
<PB N="93" REF="123"/>
Officer took the Hint, and went off
with his Drums, to try his Luck in
the Counties where there was no Ma∣nufacture,
and there he pick'd up young
Fellows enough, where they were
Poor and Proud, Idle and Lazy, as
among the Farmers, Horse-Breakers,
Gentlemens Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, 'tis Poverty and Starving
that fills Armies, not Trade and Manu∣facturing;
and therefore the <HI>Swiss</HI> and the
<HI>Grisons,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Lunen∣burghers,</HI>
the <HI>Hessians,</HI> and the <HI>Prussians,</HI>
are glad when they hear the Drums beat,
and rejoice when other Nations will hire
their Troops, and entertain their Men for
Soldiers; for their Numbers are their Grie∣vance:
And for the same Reason, the
<HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> are found dispersed
over all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and indeed
of the World, to seek Employment, either
as Soldiers or Slaves (that is Servants)
merely for want of Entertainment at Home;
whereas on the other Hand, in <HI>England,</HI>
in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Peo∣ple
have Manufacturing, and are well em∣ploy'd
at Home, nothing is more difficult
than to raise Men upon any extraordinary
Occasion; it was found so here, in the
late War with <HI>France,</HI> after a few of the
first Campaigns had carried off the loose
Fellows that a long Peace had left among
us; then they were oblig'd to make Acts of
<PB N="94" REF="124"/>
Parliament to empower the Justices to send
away all the poor Fellows they could pick
up, and force them into the Service.</P>
<P>NOR would this do neither; in the next
Reign the War being renewed, Men were
so hard to be had, the Queen was oblig'd
to hire Troops from all the neighbouring
Princes, to form her Armies; such as
<HI>Saxons, Hessians, Danes, Lunenburghers,</HI>
and the like, few <HI>English</HI> could be had
without the utmost Violence and Compul∣sion;
even the <HI>Scots</HI> themselves, what with
Disaffection, and better Business, were not
able to supply any sufficient Numbers; the
Reason was plain; Trade flourish'd, the Ma∣nufactures
were in Demand, the Merchants
gave out large Orders, and the Men were
full of Business: Indeed what poor Man in
his Senses, that could get nine Shillings,
ten Shillings, and twelve Shillings a Week
at his Loom, and at the Comb-Pot, or at
the Clothworking, Dressing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the
Manufactures, and live at home warm, easy,
and safe, would go abroad and starve in a
Camp, or be knock'd on the Head on the
Counterscarp, at the Rate of three Shillings
and six Pence a Week?</P>
<P>AND here give me Leave to remind you
of a Piece of History recent in every Man's
Head, and full to my Purpose. There was,
one Year of the late War with <HI>France,</HI> a very
terrible Scarcity of Corn throughout the
whole Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> such a Scarcity,
<PB N="95" REF="125"/>
that had it not been for the Merchants,
who, as we might say, rumaged the World
for Corn, many Thousands of People must
have perish'd more than did, for many died
of meer Want.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that there having been three
terrible Blows given to the <HI>French</HI> King
the Year before, and his Armies having been
routed on several great Occasions, as at
the Relief of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Battle of <HI>Turin,</HI>
and the Battle of <HI>Ramellies</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
all in one Campaign, the King of <HI>France</HI>
found himself greatly embarrass'd with the
Difficulty of recruiting his Armies, and it
was the Opinion of most of the Confede∣rates,
that the Fate of <HI>France</HI> was come; that
the Fall of the <HI>French</HI> Empire was at Hand,
for that his Armies were ruined, his Coun∣try
threatned on all Hands, and his People
starving, and ready to cut one another's
Throats for Bread, so that it seem'd im∣possible
for him to restore his Troops.</P>
<P>IN this Distress the General Officers
were almost affraid to speak to the King,
the old Monarch unacquainted with Mis∣fortunes,
was so wayward, so fretful, and
so full of Resentment, that none car'd to
meddle with it, and yet they saw all was
going to Wreck.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, the King publish'd
several Orders, and employ'd People, and
issued out Money every way for the amassing
Corn, from all the Quarters of the World;
<PB N="96" REF="126"/>
even from the outmost Ports in the <HI>Levant,</HI>
to <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Syria,</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to all the
Isles of the Arches, to the <HI>Gulph of Volo,</HI>
to <HI>Salonichi,</HI> and even to <HI>Constantinople</HI> it
self, and great Quantities of Corn were pro∣cured,
which the King gave express Orders
should be brought into the publick Maga∣zines,
for the supply of his Troops; but took
not the least notice, nor spoke one Word
about raising Men to recruit his Regiments,
and replace the many whole Brigades that
had been lost and cut off in the unhappy
Campaign that was past; nor did he order
his Finnanciers or Paymasters to issue out any
Money for the Supply of that important
Article, as he was always wont to do.</P>
<P><HI>At last,</HI> some of the <HI>Mareschals</HI> of
<HI>France,</HI> who presumed upon their great In∣terest
in his Favour, and were greatly con∣cern'd
at the dangerous delay, as they
look'd on it to be, resolv'd to move it to
him: <HI>His Majesty</HI> foresaw the Errand they
came about, but began with them plea∣santly
upon other Business, entertaining
them so warmly with other Discourse, that
he gave them no Opportunity to speak a
Word about the main thing they came for,
<HI>namely</HI> raising Recruits, and augmenting
his Troops, his Discourse still running ano∣ther
Way.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, <HI>His Majesty</HI> enquired of
them separately, how the People far'd in
their Provinces, and in those Provinces
<PB N="97" REF="127"/>
he knew were particularly under their Go∣vernment,
with Respect to the want of
Corn; and all agreed, that the Misery was
inexpressible, and that many of the poor
People perish'd for Want. <HI>But,</HI> says the King,
<HI>How do my Troops fare? are the Orders I
gave for supplying my poor Soldiers put in Exe∣cution?</HI>
Yes Sir, <HI>says one of the Mareschals,</HI>
and <HI>I think it was</HI> Monsieur <HI>Villeroy,</HI> such
of your Majesty's Armies as are listed, are
taken care of. <HI>I understand you,</HI> says the
King, <HI>I have given no Orders for Recruits,
nor do I intend it till next Spring,</HI> and with
that spoke again of the Corn, <HI>Are my Ma∣gasins
kept full?</HI> says the King. They an∣swered,
Yes, the Magasins were well sup∣ply'd, and were all kept full.</P>
<P>The Officers were surprized at what <HI>his
Majesty</HI> had said about Recruits; but such
was the fiery Disposition of the <HI>august Ty∣rant,</HI>
that no body cared to make the least
Reply to it; but with a profound Submis∣sion
went away, as acquiescing with the
King's Measures, tho' they thought them
the most ridiculous in the World, and
thought the King little better than stupid, or
lunatick.</P>
<P>AT their going away, the King repeated
his Orders to them, to take effectual Care
that his Troops might be supply'd with
Corn out of the publick Magasins in all the
Provinces where they were respectively
quartered, and told them he would have it
<PB N="98" REF="128"/>
publish'd that this was his Order, <HI>That so
says the King,</HI> my good Soldiers shall know
that if they suffer any Want, it is not my
Fault, but the Fault of the <HI>Mareschals</HI> of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, publick Notice was given
in Print for the Encouragement of the Troops,
that the King had given express Orders, that
the Soldiers should be supply'd with Corn out
of the publick Magasins, and the Regiments,
whose Quarters were remote from the Ma∣gasins,
were forthwith removed, so as to be
near those Magasins for their supply.</P>
<P>THIS was no sooner done, and that it
was every where known, that the Soldiers
had plenty of Bread, but the <HI>Mareschals</HI>
complimented the Wisdom of the King,
which they did not understand before; for
the poor starving Peasants run every where
to the Army, and listed so fast, that tho' the
Army wanted near 80000 Men, the Troops
were fill'd up without any Expence, and
twenty new Regiments were raised by way
of Augmentation; and all this with a sur∣prising
Expedition.</P>
<P>THIS Story abundantly confirms what I
have said, and for that Reason I told it, <HI>viz.</HI>
that Poverty and Want raises Soldiers. Trade
is a Friend to Peace, and provides for the Peo∣ple
a far better Way: Trade sets them to work
for their Bread, not to fight for it; and if we
want Men in <HI>England,</HI> 'tis not that the
<PB N="99" REF="129"/>
Number is deficient, but because they live
too well to go for Soldiers.</P>
<P>THIS also confirms what has been said
above, namely, that as the trading, middling
sort of People in <HI>England</HI> are rich; so the
labouring, manufacturing People under them
are infinitely richer than the same Class of
People in any other Nation in the World.</P>
<P>AS they are richer, so they live better,
fare better, wear better, and spend more
Money, than they do in other Countries;
and I make no doubt 'tis the same in some
other Places in their Proportion, as well as
here; at least, in free Nations, where the
People are not affraid to own their Circum∣stances,
and to appear in good Condition
when they are in good Condition: In short,
the Tradesmen in <HI>England</HI> live in better
Figure than most of the meaner Gentry;
and I may add than some of the superior
Rank in foreign Countries; nay, not to
magnifie Things here, and lessen them
Abroad, it is very evident that we have
Tradesmen or Shop-keepers, of very ordi∣nary
Employments in <HI>London,</HI> such as <HI>Cheese∣mongers,
Grocers, Chandlers, Brasiers,
Ʋpholsterers,</HI> and the like, who are able to
spend more Money in their Families, and
do actually spend more than most Gentle∣men
of from 300 to 500 Pounds a Year,
and that with this remarkable Addition,
that the Tradesman shall spend it, and grow
rich, and encrease under the Weight of the
<PB N="100" REF="130"/>
Expence; whereas the Gentleman spends to
the Extent of his Revenue, and lays up
nothing.</P>
<P>HOW many Shop-keepers, Ware-house∣keepers,
and Wholesale Traders, (to go a
Step higher) have we seen in <HI>London,</HI> such as
Drapers, Iron-Mongers, Salters, Haberdash∣ers,
<HI>Blackwell-hall,</HI> and other Factors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who shall spend 500 Pound a Year in their
Housekeeping, and other Incidents, and lay
up 500 Pound a Year more, while a Gen∣tleman
of a Thousand Pound a Year Estate,
can hardly bring both Ends together at the
close of the Year, and not live in a much
better Figure than the Tradesman, and not
at all in better Credit?</P>
<P>HOW do our Merchants in <HI>London, Bri∣stol,
Liverpole, Yarmouth, Hull,</HI> and other
trading Sea-Ports, appear in their Families,
with the Splendor of the best Gentlemen,
and even grow rich, tho' with the Luxury
and Expence of a Count of the Empire! so
true it is, that, <HI>an Estate is</HI> but <HI>a Pond,</HI> but
<HI>Trade is a Spring.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to look at the meaner People (for
among them, generally, the Wealth of
which I am now speaking is lodg'd, be∣cause,
their Number is so exceeding great)
those, it is evident, are in <HI>England</HI> support∣ed
after a different manner from the People
of equal Rank in Trade among other Nati∣ons;
let any Man that has seen how the
trading People, and the labouring Poor live
<PB N="101" REF="131"/>
abroad, make the Comparison, it is too evi∣dent
to be disputed.</P>
<P>IT is upon these two Classes of People,
the Manufacturers and the Shopkeepers,
that I build the Hypothesis which I have
taken upon me to offer to the Publick, 'tis
upon the Gain they make either by their
Labour, or their Industry in Trade, and
upon their inconceivable Numbers, that the
Home Consumption of our own Produce,
and of the Produce of foreign Nations im∣ported
here, is so exceeding great, and that
our Trade is raised up to such a Prodigy of
Magnitude, as I shall shew it is.</P>
<P>I need not describe it at large, a few
Words will give a Sketch of it, and a great
Volume will not line it out compleatly:
They eat well, and they drink well; for their
eating, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of Flesh Meat, such as Beef,
Mutton, Bacon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Proportion to their
Circumstances, 'tis to a Fault, nay, even to
Profusion; as to their Drink, 'tis generally
stout strong Beer, not to take notice of the
Quantity, which is sometimes a little too
much, or good Table Beer for their ordi∣nary
Diet; for the rest, we see their Houses
and Lodgings tolerably furnished, at least.
stuff'd well with useful and necessary house∣hold
Goods: Even those we call poor Peo∣ple,
Journey-men, working and Pains-ta∣king
People do thus; they lye warm, live in
Plenty, work hard, and (need) know no
Want.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="132"/>
THESE are the People that carry off the
Gross of your Consumption; 'tis for these
your Markets are kept open late on <HI>Saturday</HI>
Nights; because they usually receive their
Week's Wages late: 'Tis by these the
Number of Alehouses subsist, so many Brew∣ers
get Estates, and such a vast Revenue of
Excise is raised; by these the vast Quantity
of Meal and Malt is consumed: And, in a
Word, these are the Life of our whole
Commerce, and all by their Multitude:
Their Numbers are not Hundreds or Thou∣sands,
or Hundreds of Thousands, but Mil∣lions;
'tis by their Multitude, I say, that
all the Wheels of Trade are set on Foot,
the Manufacture and Produce of the Land
and Sea, finished, cur'd, and fitted for the
Markets Abroad; 'tis by the Largeness of
their Gettings, that they are supported, and
by the Largeness of their Number the whole
Country is supported; by their Wages they
are able to live plentifully, and it is by their
expensive, generous, free way of living, that
the Home Consumption is rais'd to such a
Bulk, as well of our own, as of foreign
Production: If their Wages were low and
despicable, so would be their Living; if
they got little, they could spend but little,
and Trade would presently feel it; as their
Gain is more or less, the Wealth and Strength
of the whole Kingdom would rise or fall:
For as I said above, upon their Wages it all
depends; the Price of Provisions depends
<PB N="103" REF="133"/>
on the Consumption of the Quantity; upon
the Rate of Provisions the Rent of Lands,
upon the Rent of Lands the Value of Taxes,
and upon the Value of Taxes, the Strength
and Power of the whole Body: So that
these are originally the first Spring of all the
Motion.</P>
<P>IN like manner it affects foreign Trade;
if the Poors Wages abate, the Consumption
of Quantity also, as above, would abate;
if the Quantity abates, the foreign Impor∣tation
would abate, the Brandy, the Oyl,
the Fruit, the Sugar, the Tobacco: For if
the Poor have not the Money, they can't
spare it for Superfluities, as those foreign
Articles generally are, but must preserve
it for Necessity; upon their Necessity de∣pends
the Consumption of the ordinary
Food, which is the Home Produce; and
upon their Superfluity depends the Con∣sumption
of their Extraordinaries, which is
the foreign Importation.</P>
<P>EVEN the Wine, the Spice, the Coffee
and the Tea, after the Gentry have taken
the nice and fine Species off, are beholding to
the mean, middling and trading People to
carry off the coarser Part, and the Bulk of
the Quantity goes off that way too: So that
these are the People that are the Life of
Trade.</P>
<P>THE Silk Manufactures are indeed a
Branch, the chief part of which the Gentry
may be said to support, and to help out
<PB N="104" REF="134"/>
Trade in: As to the Linen, they take in∣deed
the finest Hollands, Cambricks, Mu∣slins,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the middling Tradesmen
break in upon them, and follow them so at
the Heels, that 'tis to be questioned, whe∣ther,
as the Humour runs now, the Trades∣men
by the help of Numbers do not
out go them, even there also; not to men∣tion
the vast Quantity of Linens of other
Kind, which they consume every Day, im∣ported
from <HI>Ireland, France, Russia, Po∣land</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus mention'd the Substance
of our Trade, and the Support of it, it
remains to examine a little the Magnitude
of these several Branches, as well of Ex∣portation,
as of Importation, in Order to
make this Discourse be according to my
Title, a true <HI>Plan of the English Commerce;</HI>
and here it is necessary to make some little
Provisos, against the too forward Expecta∣tion
of the Reader, as to Numbers and
Calculations, in which it may be impossible
to go the Length which may be unreasona∣bly
expected.</P>
<P>THERE are many Things in our Com∣merce,
as well Abroad as at Home, in
which no exact Calculation can be made;
and yet perhaps our Estimates and Con∣jectures
may not be so remote as some may
imagine, or so, as that no probable Pro∣spect,
no rational View of the Commerce
may be made from them: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="135"/>
IT is not possible to make any Calculati∣on
of the Number of Shop-keepers in
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> or of the Number of Spin∣ners,
or of the Quantity of Wool, or of
the Bulk of the woollen Manufacture;
and yet, from what has been, and shall be
said, I doubt not, we shall form just and
rational <HI>Ideas</HI> in our Thoughts, of the
Greatness of our Manufacture, and of our
home Trade; and so of many other Things
which we cannot otherwise judge of, than
by such general Estimates.</P>
<P>THE World must be left in the dark,
concerning many useful Parts of Knowledge,
if we were to take no Measures, and form
no Ideas of Things from the Lights that
are given; tho' it should be true, that those
Lights do not amount to Demonstrations;
and especially, in Matters of this Kind,
where the Foundations are subject to va∣rious
Changes, and where the whole is ra∣ther
Matter of Observation, than real In∣telligence
of Fact.</P>
<P>WE may make an Estimate of many
Branches of Trade, without being able to
determine the Dimensions of either the
Subject on which those Branches are found∣ed,
or of the particular Parts themselves:
We may make just Estimates of the Re∣turns
or Treasure from the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI>
without enquiring into the Fund
of that Treasure, (<HI>viz.</HI>) how many Mines
there are discovered, in which the Silver is
<PB N="106" REF="136"/>
found, or how much every Mine that is
discover'd produces; and thus we may en∣tertain
a true Notion of the Magnitude
of woollen Manufacture, and of the great
Advantage of it to this Nation, without be∣ing
able to know, to what Value the Return
of it amounts in a Year: We may give
an Account of its being able to consume
the whole Quantity of the Growth of our
Wool in <HI>England,</HI> and of much from <HI>Ire∣land;</HI>
and we may bring this in Evidence
of the Magnitude of the whole Trade,
without being able to cast up how much
that Wool amounts to, <HI>and so of the rest.</HI></P>
<P>WE may venture to say in Publick, that
we are a most powerful Nation in Shipping,
having the greatest Number of Ships and
Seamen, of any Nation in the World, with∣out
being able to give a particular Account
how many Ships we have, or how many
Seamen we employ.</P>
<P>UPON the same Foundation, 'tis reasona∣ble
to say, we may judge of the Magnitude
of our Commerce in general, by the seve∣ral
Circumstances of the particular Bran∣ches;
<HI>for Example,</HI> the Encrease of the
Consumption or such and such Goods im∣ported,
which are absolutely requisite for
such or such a Manufacture, is a just Mea∣sure,
by which to conclude the Encrease of
that Manufacture: In other Cases we may
have plainer Rules to judge from, and to
make our Estimates by; and yet, even those
<PB N="107" REF="137"/>
Rules are not such, as that we can ascertain
those Estimates upon that Foot, because of
several Incidents in Trade, which cannot
be accounted for, any more than they can
be avoided.</P>
<P>WE may judge of the Consumption of
Wines in <HI>England,</HI> because they are all im∣ported
from Abroad, and we can have an
exact Account of the annual Importation
from the Custom-house Books; but we
cannot positively ascertain the Consump∣tion
from that Importation, because, tho'
all that are enter'd at the Custom-house,
are imported and consum'd, yet all that
are consum'd may not be enter'd at the
Custom-house; clandestine Trade, and smug∣gling
has a great Stroke in it; and the like
of foreign Brandy: <HI>Of both which hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>THUS again, we may judge of the Con∣sumption
of Spirits, by the Quantity of
Malt distill'd, and the Spirits of the first
Extraction gaug'd by the Excise-Man; but
clandestine Concealments have so great a
Share in that Trade, that we can never say
our Calculations are exact.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, if our Calculations
and Guesses are rational and probable, we
hope in these Cases it may be allow'd to
be sufficient, because it is as far as any Man
can go. The Commerce of <HI>England,</HI> is
an immense and almost incredible Thing,
and as we must content our selves with be∣ing
in some Cases in a difficulty as to Num∣bers
<PB N="108" REF="138"/>
and Figures; but in all such Cases,
we expect the Reader will be content with
the utmost possible Inquiry, and the utmost
possible Discovery that we are able to
make, and with such Reasons as may be
drawn from what appears, to judge of what
cannot be fully discover'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the first Rise, Growth and
Encrease of the COMMERCE of
England.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is something difficult to adjust
the Terms of our first Part of
this Work, they are set down in
general in our Title, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Rise, Growth, and Encrease of
our Trade; all which Words, as they im∣ply
a Progression, they necessarily imply
a stated Period, like an Epocha of Time,
from whence the Motion might be said to
begin like the starting Post, or Place of a
Race, where all that run, set out exactly
upon an Equality, whatever Advantage is
obtain'd afterwards, being the Effect of the
Strength and Vigour of the Racers, whe∣ther
Horses or Men.</P>
<P>I suppose all Nations had some Trade,
and all People some Dealing with one a∣nother
from the Begining; that is, ever
since they began to converse; when mutu∣al
Convenience guided them to enquire
what they might either want from, or spare
<PB N="110" REF="140"/>
to each other for the Supply of common
Occasions.</P>
<P>BUT this would lead us back into dull
Speculations of the Nature and Original of
Commerce; a dry useless Subject, and
therefore carefully avoided in my Title,
where it may be observ'd, that I do not
call this Work a History of Trade, or a
History of the <HI>English</HI> Trade; but a His∣tory
of the <HI>Rise, Growth,</HI> and <HI>Increase</HI> of
it; by which I mean as above, from the
Time, <HI>let that Time be when you will,</HI> when
standing upon the Square with the rest of
the World, <HI>England</HI> gave it self a Loose,
and got the Start of all the Nations a∣bout
her in Trade; and having held it ever
since, her Commerce is by that Means
arriv'd to that Prodigy for Magnitude,
which it appears in at this Time, and
in which 'tis acknowledg'd by all her
Neighbours, she out-does all the Nations
in the World, as we shall see in the next
Chapter.</P>
<P>HOW to fix this Period without running
out into foreign Enquiries, and giving a
State of Things tedious in themselves, and
remote from our Design, is the Thing we
are now to attend to; and tho' I shall do
it my own Way, and may differ from the
Opinion of some wiser than my self; yet,
I shall endeavour to support my Opinion
with such Reasons, as shall bring over such
differing Judgments to agree with me; or
<PB N="111" REF="141"/>
I shall, for want of it, submit to theirs;
so that either way the End will be an∣swer'd,
and the Magnitude and Encrease
of the Commerce of <HI>England</HI> be con∣firm'd
and describ'd, and the Time of it
ascertain'd.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> being an Island surrounded with
the Sea, and with neighbouring powerful Na∣tions;
her Converse in Peace, and at other
Times her Wars with those Nations, made
Shipping in particular exceedingly necessary
to her; and we find upon many Occasions,
the <HI>English</HI> Fleets not only very numerous,
but very formidable; yet History is very
barren on that Occasion, nor is there the
least Fragment to be gather'd up, that in∣timates
to us, when, how, or in what man∣ner
this Nation began their Acquaintance
with the Sea.</P>
<P>WE gather some Negatives indeed from
History, as to this Part; we are pretty
well assured, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had no
Knowledge of Navigation, nor do we read
of any Ships in Use among them, when
<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> landed here with a great
Navy.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Romans</HI> had Ships, and
that the <HI>Britans</HI> had none, or none con∣siderable,
will, I believe, be granted;
and as the <HI>Romans</HI> afterwards conquer'd
and possess'd the Island, as is evident
from History, nothing then can be more
natural, than to suppose, that the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="142"/>
first introduc'd the Knowledge of Na∣vigation,
and the Use of Ships in this
Island.</P>
<P>IT is true, and we are told it from Histo∣ry,
that the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> traded hither se∣veral
Ages before the <HI>Romans,</HI> and with
their best Ships, no doubt; but be that
so or no, we do not find that the <HI>Britains</HI>
learn'd any thing from them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes,</HI> after this, came in great
Fleets, and ravag'd the Coasts, both of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy;</HI> what their Ships
were, we know not; but 'tis evident, they
were such, as neither the <HI>Britains</HI> or <HI>Sax∣ons</HI>
could cope with; so that even after
the <HI>Romans</HI> were gone, the Knowledge of
Shipping and Navigation seems to be much
sunk and decay'd in <HI>England,</HI> and even in
this whole Part of the World; for accord∣ing
to Mr. <HI>Cambden,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> themselves
came over in strange Boats; that is to
say, in Boats or Vessels, as we may suppose,
built of Wood; that is, of Timber and
Boards, or Planks, and cover'd with a
kind of Tarpawlin, or Canvas dipt in Tar
and Oil, which being nail'd upon the Plank,
serv'd instead of Caulking, to keep out the
Water.</P>
<P>IF this is true, the northern World, who
at this Time so much out-do the rest of
the Nations in the navigating Skill, came
very late into the Knowledge, either of
<PB N="113" REF="143"/>
building of Ships, or of managing them
when built.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes,</HI> we may suppose, had bet∣ter
Vessels, tho' not such as would now
deserve the Name of Ships, and were nei∣ther
fit for Fight or Freight, for War or
Trade; only prepar'd to waft over a Par∣cel
of Thieves and Rovers, who came in
a desperate manner, to fight, plunder and
destroy, without any View or Design of
returning; and therefore, when they burnt
their Ships, as sometimes they did, and
sometimes the <HI>Britains</HI> or <HI>British Saxons</HI>
rather did for them, they had no great
Loss, for sending but one Vessel Express to
<HI>Norway,</HI> or to the Coast of <HI>Juitland,</HI> they
presently had as many more as they pleased;
but all this while, here was no Shipping
for Trade, no nor much Business for Ship∣ping,
if they had been furnish'd with Ves∣sels
to be employ'd.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, what Commerce there
was carry'd on at that Time between <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
and any other Countries, the Parti∣culars
of which, it is very hard to know,
was certainly carry'd on in foreign Bot∣oms,
till the Encrease of Commerce
brought the <HI>English</HI> to build Ships, or the
Encrease of Shipping brought the Com∣merce;
take it which Way we will, one is
as probable as the other.</P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> transport∣ed
his Army over hither in Ships and Gal∣lies,
<PB N="114" REF="144"/>
from the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>Gaul</HI>
as he calls it in his Commentaries; but 'tis
as true by the same Commentary, that
he caused those Ships to be built by his
own People, I mean, <HI>Romans;</HI> for we do
not find that the <HI>Gauls,</HI> any more than the
<HI>Britains,</HI> had any Ships before.</P>
<P>HE built the Ships it is said in about two
Months, so that they could not be very
great; and he tells something of it himself,
that for the Gallies, when they were land∣ed
in <HI>Britain,</HI> they haul'd them up upon
the Beach: What Ships were employ'd for
Commerce, we cannot tell; yet there was
some Trade at that Time too; for <HI>Caesar</HI>
says, the <HI>Britains</HI> had Intelligence of his
Design to invade them, by Merchants who
frequented their Coasts: See <HI>Caes. Com.</HI>
Lib. IV. Cap. 9. But all this leaves us
in the Dark, either as to their Commerce,
or their Navigation; what they traded in,
or what Vessels they traded with; 'tis cer∣tain,
the <HI>Britains</HI> had very little Trade,
and less Shipping, for we read of no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of
their Ships for many Ages afterward.</P>
<P>WHETHER therefore in succeeding Ages,
Navigation introduc'd Trade, or Trade
Navigation, is a Dispute not much mate∣rial
here; 'tis probable it may stand thus,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Necessity produc'd the Converse of
Nations one with another, for the Supply
of their mutual Wants, exchanging the
<PB N="115" REF="145"/>
Produce of their respective Countries, as
their Wants severally directed.</P>
<P>THIS exchanging of the Produce of
Countries, produced Commerce or Trade.</P>
<P>TRADE thus explain'd, necessarily re∣quired
a <HI>Voiture</HI> or Carriage of Goods, by
Land or by Water; the latter requir'd Ves∣sels
to carry them in, either to sail or to row,
and this is Navigation.</P>
<P>IF I was to write a History of Naviga∣tion,
I should go back here to the first In∣vention
of Boats to row, of which they tell
us the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> were the Inventers; and
of Sails to make use of the Wind, of which
they tell us the Fable of <HI>Dedalus</HI> and <HI>Ica∣rus</HI>
is a Representation, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Dedalus</HI>
being a Prisoner at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> contriv'd a Sail
to his Boat, and taking his Opportunity
when the Wind blew fresh from the Shore,
put boldly out to Sea in the Sight of all the
People; his Son <HI>Icarus</HI> doing the like in
another Boat fitted out by his Father's Di∣rection.
That the People enraged to see
them attempt their Escape even before
their Faces, pursued them with Boats row'd
with many Oars, laughing at the Madness
of the Attempt. But that when they came
out to Sea, <HI>Dedalus</HI> run two Foot for their
one, <HI>as the Seamen express it;</HI> the Sea also
being rough, and the Wind blowing a fresh
Gale; so he made his Escape from them all,
which they called flying in the Air with
waxen Wings. As for his Son <HI>Icarus,</HI> he
<PB N="116" REF="146"/>
outwent his Pursuers too, but impatient,
and not content with his Escape, but wil∣ling
to go faster, he crowding too much
Sail, as the Seamen call it, or not having
Judgment to sill, trim, and manage his Sails
skilfully as his Father did, he over-set
his Boat, and was drown'd which the
Fable represents, by soaring too high, and
melting his Wings.</P>
<P>BUT these Things would lead me out of
my Way, I am not writing of Navigation,
but of Trade and Commerce: So I return
to my Subject.</P>
<P>It seems the <HI>Dutch,</HI> [(for the <HI>Flemings</HI>
were all called <HI>Dutch</HI>) a diligent and labo∣rious
People were in Trade before us, and
being in Search of proper Methods to im∣prove
and enrich themselves, fell to Manu∣facturing.
In this the first of their Im∣provement,
as I am assured by good Au∣thority,
was <HI>making Linen,</HI> which they
fell into by the Instruction of some <HI>Cartha∣ginian</HI>
Merchants, who fled into <HI>France</HI>
by Sea from the Fury of the Wars between
the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> which War
afterwards ended in the Destruction of their
City.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that the <HI>Carthagini∣ans</HI>
were great Friends to Trade, and En∣couragers
both of Merchants and of Manu∣facture
(that is a History by it self). These
I say sled to <HI>France,</HI> and thence some of
them to <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="147"/>
had not made so intire a Conquest as in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>HERE they fell to Trade, and Manufactu∣ring,
and having planted the Flax, which
they found the Country very proper to
produce, they of Course set the People to
Work, instructing them how to dress the
Flax, spin the Yarn or Thread, weave
the Cloth, bleach it afterwards, and then to
sell it; and this I take to be a true Account
of setting up the Linen Manufacture in
the seventeen Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> had their Linen
Manufacture from the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI>
they from the <HI>Tyrians</HI> or <HI>Phaenicians,</HI>
of whom they were a Colony, and
they from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the fine Li∣nen
of <HI>Aegypt</HI> is often mentioned in
the Scripture History, and in others
also, as the most antient.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY seldom wants Business: The
<HI>Flemings</HI> falling into the Manufacture of
Linen, it led them as it were by the Hand
into that of the Wool; and the same <HI>Car∣thaginian</HI>
Refugees put them upon that al∣so,
for the old <HI>Numidians</HI> had Wool in
great Plenty, and the Wool of <HI>Barbary</HI> is
good to this Day.</P>
<P>BUT here they were put to a Stop, for
neither <HI>Belgia (Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI>) or
<HI>Gaul (France</HI>) yielded any Wool: This
balk'd their Undertaking for a while;
but the diligent Tradesman never tires; it
<PB N="118" REF="148"/>
was not long before, searching among the
neighbouring Nations, they found that
they had Wool in <HI>Britains,</HI> and that so
fine and good, that no other Wool the
World produced was equal to it, for their
Business.</P>
<P>THIS encouraged them so, that they
bought the Wool in <HI>Britain,</HI> manufactured
it in <HI>Belgia,</HI> and supplied first themselves, and
afterwards the neighbouring Countries with
woollen Manufactures, to the great Encrease
of the Wealth and Power of the <HI>Nether∣lands;</HI>
especially by drawing infinite Mul∣titudes
of People to them, so that they
soon became, from, a few fishing Towns,
and a poor labouring People, to be a most
populous, rich, and powerful Nation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Britains</HI> too, in their Degree,
found the Sweetness of this Encrease of
Commerce, and next to the <HI>Flemings</HI> had
their Share of the Gain from the Wool of
their Sheep: This Wool was but of small
Value to them before; for instead of manu∣facturing
in as the <HI>Flemings</HI> did, they wore
the Skins of their Sheep with the Wool on:
But now the <HI>Flemings</HI> eagerly calling for
the Wool, and giving a good Price for it,
the <HI>Britains</HI> were not only encouraged to
preserve it, but to nourish and take more
Care of their Sheep, in order to encrease
the Number of them, that they might, in
the Consequence, encrease the Wool.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="149"/>
THUS began the <HI>English Commerce,</HI>
and thus it may be said began the Opulence
and Greatness of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; for
the <HI>Flemings</HI> took off their Wool in a pro∣digious
Quantity, and gave also a prodigi∣ous
Price for it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> WE find in King <HI>Edward</HI> the
III's. Time they gave 40 <HI>l.</HI> a Pack
for the <HI>English</HI> Wool, which by the
Way was more than 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Pack,
as Money goes now; but of that in
its Place.</P>
<P>THIS filled the Nation with Money,
the Merchants grew rich, the Staple of the
<HI>English</HI> Wool was erected at <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
50000 Packs of Wool was the least that
was carried thither yearly, and the Fleets
of Ships which carried over the Wool, and
which went generally from <HI>Southampton</HI>
and <HI>London,</HI> were such, that sometimes
Fifty, Sixty, to 100 Sail, went off at a
Time.</P>
<P>IT is to be doubted indeed, the Ships
were most of them <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that is to
say <HI>Flemings,</HI> or in general <HI>Dutch,</HI> for I
do not find, but that as they were before us
in Trade and Manufacture, so they were
also before us in Shipping and Navigation;
tho' growing rich by the Wool, we soon
fell in to building Ships too, especially as
Trade encreased; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>As the Quantity of the Wool was thus
great, and the Price also, the Ballance of
<PB N="120" REF="150"/>
Trade was necessarily very great on our
Side, I mean great to the Advantage of
<HI>Britain;</HI> for the <HI>Britain</HI> bought but little
of any Goods from Abroad, for many A∣ges
after this, and their Wool was gene∣rally
paid for in Money; nay, they had
two several Products, beside the Wool,
which were peculiar to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
and which no other Nation in the World
had, (<HI>viz.</HI>) their <HI>Block Tin,</HI> and their
<HI>Lead.</HI></P>
<P>WE have very good Evidence, that both
these Metals were found and dug by the
antient <HI>Britains,</HI> long before this, and e∣specially
that the Tin was fetch'd from
<HI>Britain</HI> by the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> many Ages
before the Time I am now speaking of.</P>
<P>I take it, that at the first of the Trade
with the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Importations of
<HI>Britain</HI> were so small, that the Export of
<HI>Tin</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> was sufficient to purchase all
that they wanted from Abroad: So that
the Wool was necessarily all paid for in
Specie.</P>
<P>THIS I say enrich'd the <HI>British</HI> Nati∣ons
to a very great Degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill'd them
with ready Money, and especially the lan∣ded
Men grew very rich and powerful by
it, I mean the Barons, Knights, Gentlemen
and other Degrees, for they were the
Men that got the Money, the Wool and
the Sheep being their own.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="151"/>
<HI>N. B.</HI> WHEN I say other Degrees of
Men, I mean plainly the Clergy, for the
religious Houses had many, if not most
of their Rents paid in Wool; and
some had large Flocks of Sheep of
their own, kept by their own Shep∣herds,
for the Supply of the House,
(that is the Fryars) and their large
Attendants with Mutton, and for Sup∣ply
of Money to their Coffers by the
Wool; and we see the Clergy tax'd in
King <HI>Edward</HI> the III's Time, in
so much Wool to the King and his
Wars.</P>
<P>IT is almost incredible what immense
Sums of Money came over yearly to this
Kingdom for the Wool, and how rich and
powerful <HI>England</HI> grew by this Means,
even in the Time of the <HI>Normans</HI> Govern∣ment;
and had they not been so often ex∣hausted
by foreign Wars, peel'd and pol'd
by their tyrant Princes, ravag'd and wasted
at home by one another, I mean in civil
Dissentions, and plunder'd and emptied by
the foolish and ridiculous Zeal, or rather
Fury, call'd <HI>the Holy War,</HI> they might
have been infinitely richer than they
were.</P>
<P>LET but any Man of Figures calculate
the Commerce at that Time; the Wool on∣ly
that was exported, at the Rate above
mentioned, amounted to two Millions <HI>Ster∣ling</HI>
in Specie; an immense Sum, and more
<PB N="122" REF="152"/>
than Ten Millions <HI>per Annum</HI> would be
now.</P>
<P>IT is indeed very strange, that when
every Thing else was so cheap, the Wool
should be so dear, and that now, when every
Thing else is so dear, the Wool should
be so cheap; we only are left in some Un∣certainty
as to what was then called a Pack
of Wool, and how they could give such a
Price for it; if the Pack was the same then
as it is now, the Price was intolerable,
perhaps it might be made up in such large
Packs, as we still see sometimes brought into
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> one of which loads a Waggon,
and is called a Poke of Wool, or a Pocket;
but that we cannot now determine: But be
the Bulk what it will, the Number of
Packs was the same.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Pack of Wool must be much
larger than it is now, otherwise the Quan∣tity
of Wool produced in <HI>England</HI> was but
trifling; for as to 50000 Packs of Wool to
be the whole Crop, or the whole Product,
'tis ridiculous to suggest it, 'tis evident
we import more than twice that Quantity
now yearly from <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Wool or
in Yarn; the Wool of <HI>England</HI> is more
likely to amount to five Hundred Thou∣sand
Packs, than to fifty Thousand; and
we are assured, as you will see, by a just
Calculation in its Place, that the Sheep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
in <HI>Rumney</HI> Mash only in <HI>Kent▪</HI> make 2523
Packs of Wool every Year; which, were
<PB N="123" REF="153"/>
the whole calculated, is not a two Hun∣dredth
Part of the Wool of the whole
Country.</P>
<P>BUT to leave our Guesses at the Mag∣nitude
of the Pack of Wool, I am ready to
grant it must be larger than ours are now,
which are but two hundred and forty
Pound Weight to a Pack, and could never
be worth forty Pound Sterling; but if a Pack
was a Poke, and weighed twenty Hundred
Weight, as the Poke of Wool still does, and
is called in some Places a Load of Wool, be∣cause
'tis <HI>a Waggon Load,</HI> then indeed it
might yield such a Rate (tho' dear too) and
it also agrees best with the Growth or
Crop of <HI>Wool</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which would
then be about 400000 Packs a Year, and it
was an immense Business of its Kind too,
for the Time of Day in Trade.</P>
<P>THAT this Trade was really a Prodigy
for Magnitude, at that Time, appears by
many Particular Circumstances; and espe∣cially
by this, that great Increase of Wealth
and People, which the Manufacturing of it
brought to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> that is, to
the seventeen Provinces, whose Greatness,
as well as ours, began here.</P>
<P>NOR is it so long ago that this Trade
receiv'd a Turn, that we should want Evi∣dence
of the Fact, for it continued in the
same Situation to the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the
VII. and tho' we began then (by the Wis∣dom
and Sagacity of the Prince) to break
<PB N="124" REF="154"/>
in upon the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and to manufacture
much of our Wool at home, yet we find no
Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool,
till the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for the
Fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. we find a large Fleet
of <HI>Flemings</HI> laden with Wool, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd from
<HI>Southampton</HI> for the <HI>Scheld,</HI> being above
sixty Sail, that Wool being sent to pay the
King's Debts.</P>
<P>I have met with some who are of the
Opinion, that the Trade of the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI>
in the Woollen Manufacture, was
much greater then, than it is now here, or
than it has ever been since; and they give
these Reasons for it,</P>
<P>1. THAT if they had not had a most ex∣tensive
consumption, they could never have
been able to have consumed such a Quantity
of Wool; for <HI>England</HI> being not enclosed
and cultivated then, as it is now, they sup∣pose
the Quantity of Wool was much grea∣ter,
than it has been at any time since.</P>
<P>2. THAT they had no Rivals in the Trade;
no other Nation, for many Ages, having
any such thing as a woollen Manufacture
among them; and this gave them such a
Command of the Trade, as to be able to
give a Price for the Materials, and to sell
the Manufacture when wrought at a Rate
in Proportion.</P>
<P>3. THAT by the same Rule they had all
the Trade; and tho' it is true, they had not
extended the woollen Manufacture into
<PB N="125" REF="155"/>
<HI>Turky, Russia,</HI> and to both the <HI>Indies,</HI> as it
is now, and to several other remote Coun∣tries;
yet, on the other hand, they had the
whole Extent of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and the
<HI>German Empire, Poland, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
to supply with Goods; none of those
Countries making any thing of a Woollen
Manufacture; and as at length, the Domi∣nions
of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> fell to the House
of <HI>Austria,</HI> and that <HI>Spain, Germany,
Italy,</HI> and the whole <HI>seventeen Provinces,</HI>
were united under one Head, in the Go∣vernment
of that great Monarch <HI>Charles</HI>
V. they were allowed an unlimited Com∣merce
through all his Dominions, and had all
possible Encouragement for their Goods, of
which I might give many Particulars.</P>
<P>THESE things considered, it must be gran∣ted,
that their Trade was exceeding great;
whether it was equal or superior to our
Trade of the same kind now, is what no
body can make any Calculation of: And
therefore I shall not attempt to form any
Plan or View or Trade upon those remote
Guesses.</P>
<P>THE Turn given to this Trade afterward,
and the Wealth raised upon it in <HI>England</HI>
in so short a Space, as was seen in <HI>Queen
Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, may give us some Idea of
what it was before; and this part indeed
cannot without a Breach in our Work, as it
is proposed in my Title, be quite pass'd
over; but I shall be as brief in it as I can.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="156"/>
THAT King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. was the first
Prince that put the <HI>English</HI> upon the
Thought of manufacturing their own Wool,
must be acknowledged to his Memory; we
should not do him Justice, if we did not
mention it, as often as the Original of our
Woollen Manufacture is spoken of.</P>
<P>HE had been a kind of a Refugee in the
Court of his Aunt the Dutchess of <HI>Burgun∣dy,</HI>
being forc'd to make his Escape from
<HI>Bretagne,</HI> where he first harbour'd; while
he was here, he had opportunity to see as
well as hear of the mighty Increase and Im∣provement
of the Commerce of those Coun∣tries;
how populous their Cities, how rich
their Burghers, how great their Merchants,
how all the People were busy, and employ'd;
hardly a Child above five Years old, but
could do something to gain its Bread; and
particularly, it could not escape his Observa∣tion,
that all this Commerce, all this Wealth,
all this Imployment of the People depended
entirely upon the Supply of the Materials,
<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Wool</HI> and <HI>Fullers Earth</HI> from
<HI>England;</HI> that they had not a Pack of Wool
of their own in the whole Country, and if
that Source should by any Accident be stop∣ped,
they should be all ruin'd, their Trade
would be at a full Stop, and in a Word, that
the Manufacture could not be carried on
without it.</P>
<P>TO a Prince of such Penetration as he
was, it could not but occur after he came to
<PB N="127" REF="157"/>
the Crown, that certainly <HI>England</HI> was
much in the wrong, to let their Wool go
out of the Country thus unmanufactur'd,
and to let Strangers be made rich by
the working of it, while his own People
sat idle and unemployed, and consequently
starving the Poor.</P>
<P>THAT without doubt, where the Prin∣cipals
and Materials of the Manufacture
were only to be found, there Nature seem'd
to direct the making of the Manufacture it
self, and there it might be wrought with
the greatest Advantage; that, at least, it
would be an Advantage to his own King∣dom,
and that he could see no Reason why
that Advantage should be given away. In
short, he resolved, that if he could prevent
it, Strangers should no longer eat the Bread
out of the Mouths of his own Subjects.</P>
<P>I need not enter here into the particular
Measures the King took to put this happy
Resolve of his in Execution; 'tis enough to
mention it here, that in Persuit of these
Observations, he immediately let about the
Work, applied himself to the finding out pro∣per
Instruments for the carrying it on, and
set the Manufacture of Wool on Foot in
several Parts of his Country, as particularly
at <HI>Wakefield, Leeds</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in the
West Riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> a Country pitch'd
upon for its particular Situation, adapted to
the Work, being fill'd with innumerable
Springs of Water, Pits of Coal, and other
<PB N="128" REF="158"/>
Things proper for carrying on such a BusI∣ness,
and where it remains and thrives to
this Day.</P>
<P>BUT not, I say, to enter into the Particu∣lars
of this historically, which would be too
tedious, 'tis sufficient to lay, the anxious
Care of this Prince for the Prosperity of his
People has been followed with such a glori∣ous
Success, that the Example is perfectly
fitted to fire the Breast of any succeeding
Monarch, who desires the Good of his
Subjects with the same paternal Warmth for
the general Improvement; and for this End
I mention it, and for this End these Sheets
are thus addressed to the supreme Powers of
the <HI>British</HI> Government, and at this Time
too; because, being assur'd that his pre∣sent
Majesty has the same Ardour and Affe∣ction,
the same improving Genius, and the
Advantage of a much greater Fund of Wealth
and Power for the advancing the Interest of
his People, nothing may be wanting to lay
open the several Prospects for the farther
improving the Commerce and extending the
Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> which yet remain,
and which perhaps have not been so tho∣rowly
consider'd of by any other Hand.</P>
<P>THO' <HI>King Henry</HI> acted with a Vigor
becoming a Prince, and one that knew how
to execute, as well as how to resolve, for the
Advantage of his own Dominions; yet he
knew withal, that it was an Attempt of
such a Magnitude, as well deserv'd the ut∣most
<PB N="129" REF="159"/>
Prudence and Caution, that as it was
not to be attempted rashly; so it was not
to be push'd with too much Warmth: And
therefore, tho' he did not fail to encourage
his People in working and manufacturing,
and at a considerable Expence, secretly pro∣cured
a great many Foreigners, who were
perfectly skill'd in the Manufacture, to come
over and instruct his own People here in
their Beginnings; yet he did not immedi∣ately
prohibit the exporting the Wool to the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> neither did he, till some Years
after, load the Exportation of it with any
more Duties than he had before.</P>
<P>NAY, so far was the King from being able
to compleat his Design, that he could ne∣ver
come to a total Prohibition of expor∣ting
the Wool in his Reign; he did indeed
offer at it, but found, that if he had pro∣ceeded,
his People were not Masters enough
of the Trade to work up the whole Quan∣tity
of the Wool, and consume the Growth;
that the <HI>Flemings</HI> were old in the Business,
long experienced, and turn'd their Hands
this Way and that Way, to new Sorts and
Kinds of Goods, which the <HI>English</HI> could
not presently know, and when known, had
not Skill presently to imitate: And that
therefore they must proceed gradually.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if in some Years the <HI>English</HI> were
able to supply themselves, and make Goods
enough for the Home Consumption, so that
they had no need to buy from the <HI>Flemings</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="160"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="130" REF="162"/>
the Manufactures of their own Wool, This
was a great Point gain'd, and was a Step
sufficient for the first Ages of the Manu∣facture;
whereas, to have prohibited the
Wool being carry'd out while they were
not able to supply the Markets abroad,
was to ruin the Trade in general, and stop
the Consumption of the Wool too.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the King acted like a
wise and warlike Prince, besieging a City,
who tho' he attacks the Garrison, and
batters the Out-works with the utmost
Fury, yet spares the Inhabitants, and for∣bears
as much as he can ruining the City,
which he expects to make his own: So
the King seem'd willing to let the <HI>Flemings</HI>
keep up the Trade, till his Subjects were
thoro'ly enabled to take it into their own
Hands, and not destroy a Commerce, which
he knew would one Time or other be his
own.</P>
<P>UPON this Foot, I say, the prudent
Prince went on by Measures perfectly well
adjuusted, and particularly adapted to the
End which he aim'd at; and tho' he did
once pretend to stop the Exportation of
the Wool, he conniv'd at the Breach of
his Order, and afterwards took off the Pro∣hibition
entirely, leaving the Success of his
Undertaking, to the Industry of his Peo∣ple,
who, he perceiv'd, to his great Sa∣tisfaction,
went on with Courage and
Chearfulness, improv'd daily, and would
<PB N="131" REF="163"/>
at last entirely carry the Business from the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> by the meer Course of Things.</P>
<P>IN this Manner the Manufacture began,
and thus gradually it encreas'd; nor was
it much less than one hundred Years, be∣fore
<HI>England</HI> came to such a Perfection, as
to be able to claim the Property of it
to themselves, and to prohibit the Expor∣tation
of the Wool, which was never ef∣factually
done, till the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tyranny
under the Duke <HI>d'Alva</HI> finish'd the ruin
of the Commerce of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI>
by driving the <HI>Dutch</HI> into a Common-Wealth,
to cast off entirely the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Government; and by forcing the Prote∣stant
<HI>Flemings,</HI> who, indeed, were the
chief Manufacturers, to take Shelter in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
where they presently erected all the
several Species of the Manufacture, which
were not set up before.</P>
<P>THUS it was, from the Year 1489, when
King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. began to encourage the
Manufacture in <HI>England,</HI> to the Year 1587,
when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> may be said to see
it arriv'd to its Perfection, that this great
Work was gradually encreasing and bring∣ing
forward.</P>
<P>IT is worth observing here, in how short a
Time the Queen having fully stop'd the
Stream of Wool which supported the Ma∣nufacture
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> spread the Com∣merce
of <HI>England,</HI> into the remotest Parts
of the then known World, and carry'd
<PB N="132" REF="164"/>
the Trade of the woollen Manufacture of
<HI>England,</HI> into every Part which the <HI>Flem∣ings</HI>
had supply'd before, and to many
Places where they had no Business.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were erected into
a separate State under the Queen's Protecti∣on,
and who breaking off from the <HI>Flem∣ings,</HI>
that is, from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had no
Commerce with them, meddled not with
Manufacturing, but apply'd themselves to
their fisnng Trade, and to foreign Mer∣chandize;
and having before a very great
Correspondence by their Rivers, <HI>viz,</HI> the
<HI>Maes,</HI> the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> and other Rivers into <HI>Ger∣man,</HI>
they naturally apply'd to <HI>England</HI>
for the woollen Manufacture, which they
had formerly been supply'd with from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and were, as we may call them,
our first Customers for them Abroad.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Queen</HI> heartily engaged in the
Interest of her People, and particularly
espousing her Merchants, sent formal Em∣bassies,
with splendid Retinues, and in the
most honourable Manner, for the opening
the Sluices of Trade to her Subjects; 1. To
the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> 2. To the <HI>Great Duke,</HI>
or Emperor of <HI>Russia or Muscovy.</HI> 3. To the
<HI>Great Mogul;</HI> 4. To the King of, <HI>Persia,</HI> and
in a Word, to every other Place, whither
her enterprising Subjects desir'd her; for it
was at that Time an enterprising Age, and
the <HI>English</HI> Merchants spread the Seas
<PB N="133" REF="165"/>
with their Ships, as the Poet expresses it,
every where as far
<Q>As Winds could carry, or as Waters
roll.</Q></P>
<P>3. UNDER her Majesty's Conduct, and
by her particular Encouragement, her fortu∣nate
Navigators, her Merchants, and o∣ther
Adventurers began to shew themselves,
not experienc'd only in, but Patrons and
Improvers of Navigation, beyond all the
Trades of the World; they ranged about
the Seas having then no Rivals; search∣ing
the Globe for Discoveries, planting Co∣lonies,
and settling Factories in all Parts of
the World: But I must come to speak of
this Part again more at large.</P>
<P>BY this last Part of the Queen's Manage∣ment,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) prohibiting the Exportation
of the Wool, the woollen Manufacture in
the <HI>Netherlands</HI> received its fsatal Wound;
the <HI>Spanish</HI> cruelty scatter'd the chief Manu∣facturers,
and the Prohibition starv'd those
that were left; for now having no more
Wool to work up, the Work it self stop'd
at once, the Trade expir'd and dy'd: Nor
has it been able since that to revive, no
not in the least Degree; for as it depended
before entirely, upon the Supply of Wool
from <HI>England</HI> for its Support, when that
Stream said, when that Chanel stop'd, it
could no more subsist, than a Body with∣out
<PB N="134" REF="166"/>
out Food, or Life without Sprits: In a
word, the <HI>Flemings</HI> impoverish'd and poor,
dispersed and fed; their great Cities, such
as <HI>Antwerp, Ghent, Lisle,</HI> and other Pla∣ces
wasted and decayed; the People went
away into other Parts to seek Peace and
Employment; the populous Towns became
thin of Inhabitants, compared to what they
were; and the new establish'd Common∣Wealth
of <HI>Holland</HI> became populous and
rich, out of their Ruins.</P>
<P>THE People who remain'd, and who
are yet numerous, tho' not like what
they were before, apply'd to other Works,
such as Lace, Linen, and particularly fine
Thread, fine Cambricks, and whatever else
offer'd, for it must be own'd they are a
most industrious People.</P>
<P>THEY are now further reduc'd in their
Bounds by the <HI>French,</HI> who have taken from
them the whole Province of <HI>Artois,</HI> and great
Part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Hainault;</HI> and especial∣ly,
the Port of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the great Cities
of <HI>Arras, Cambray, Doway,<SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>isle,</HI> St.
<HI>Omers,</HI> and many others, so that the remain∣ing
Part, which is now call'd the <HI>Netherlands,</HI>
is but small, compar'd to what
it was; and their Trade is chiefly con∣sin'd
to the merchandizing Part, which
they carry on by the River Navigation
with <HI>Holland</HI> on one Side, and with <HI>France</HI>
on the other, and by the Manufacture as
above, of Lace and Linen: As to the wool∣len
<PB N="135" REF="167"/>
<HI>len</HI> Manufactures, they are oblig'd to give
them over, and to buy them of their Sup∣planters
the <HI>English,</HI> to whom they for∣merly
sold them.</P>
<P>THIS being the antient State of our
Commerce, and from which it deriv'd its
Being, I thought it absolutely necessary to
give this Summary of it, that we may have
no Occasion to look back any more, but
begin the Plan of its subsequent Improve∣ments
at this general <HI>Epocha,</HI> as from its
real Fountain Head, and as it is properly
an <HI>English</HI> Commerce.</P>
<P>THE Improvements of our Trade from
this Time are no less wonderful; its pre∣sent
Magnitude I call a Prodigy, and I
think it well deserves that Name. How it
come to arrive to such a Height, and how
it may be farther improved and increased in
Spite of all the Prohibitions and Encroach∣ments
of its Neighbours, remains to be dis∣cours'd
of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Encrease of the English Com∣merce,
from the, Time of Queen
ELIZAB TH's breaking with the
Spaniard.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the last Chapter, I mention'd
the Inclination Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
had to propagate the Interest of
her People; and especially, that
of their Commerce. I must observe here,
as an additional Remark, that this Warmth
of the Queen their Sovereign, fir'd her Sub∣jects
with an inexpressible Ardor for new
Discoveries, planting Colonies, finding out
unknown Passages, settling Factories, en∣gaging
in new Correspondences for Trade,
and the like; and in this Reign, and in
pursuit of this new Principle, (for it was
new at that Time,) they began several of
the present most flourishing Branches of
our present Commerce, and where our
woollen Manufactures are now best esta∣blish'd:
<HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>1. THE Queen sending an Embassy, as I
have said, to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants
<PB N="137" REF="169"/>
obtain'd Licenses of the Great Duke
for a certain Number of them to pass with
their Merchandize thro' his vast Dominions
into <HI>Persia,</HI> where they carried their <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Cloth, Kerseys, Bays, Says, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
sold them to great Advantage, and brought
back their Returns by the same Way 2500
Miles upon the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> 800 Miles up∣on
the <HI>Dwina</HI> to <HI>Arch-Angel;</HI> besides cros∣sing
the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and besides their Jour∣ney
by Land to <HI>Ispahan.</HI> These were af∣terwards
call'd the <HI>Russia Company,</HI> and
indeed, they carry'd on a very noble and
gainful Commerce, as well to themselves,
as to their Country, till it was afterwards
interrupted by the meer absolute Tyranny
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Emperor or Great Duke,
without any Offence given, and without
so much as a Pretence of any.</P>
<P>THIS Journey, besides the Voyage by
Sea, between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI>
then also newly discover'd, was five Times
perform'd by one Merchant of <HI>London,</HI>
whose Name was <HI>Lancaster,</HI> as may at
large be seen in <HI>Huckluyt</HI>'s, <HI>Voyages.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Queen having by an Ambassador,
as I have said, establish'd a Treaty of Peace
and Commerce with <HI>Solyman the magnifi∣cent,</HI>
the Great Emperor of the <HI>Turks;</HI> Her
Merchants immediately follow'd with their
Ships; and the <HI>Turky</HI> Company being by
that means erected and establish'd, they set∣tled
their Factories at <HI>Constantinople, Smir∣na,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="170"/>
and at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where the Trade flou∣rish'd
and encreased to a very great Mag∣nitude,
and continues to this Day.</P>
<P>3. THE War with <HI>Spain</HI> encouraging
her Majesty's Subjects to farther Adven∣tures,
partly for Reprisals upon the <HI>Spani∣ard,</HI>
and partly for Discoveries, Sir <HI>Wal∣ter
Raleigh, Drake, Smith,</HI> and others,
upon the meer Account of Commerce, dis∣cover'd
and planted the great, and now
flourishing Colonies of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s-<HI>Bay, New-England,
Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Burmoodas,</HI> with
the Fishery or <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> the Mag∣nitude
and Commerce of which Countries,
is not easily to be described; and to which
are since then added, the Island Colonies
of <HI>America,</HI> called in common the <HI>West∣Indies,</HI>
such as <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Antegoa,</HI>
St. <HI>Christophers, &amp;c.</HI> and at last <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
and upon the Continent, <HI>New-York,</HI> with
East and West <HI>Jersey,</HI> obtain'd by Con∣quest
from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Pensilvania</HI>
and <HI>Carolina,</HI> obtain'd by more modern
and extended Discoveries.</P>
<P>TO and from these, the Advantage of
the <HI>English</HI> Commerce is such at this Time
in the Consumption of <HI>European</HI> Goods
sent thither, and particularly the <HI>British</HI> Pro∣duct,
and their Manufactures of Linen,
Woollen and Silk; in the Numbers of Sea∣men
and Ships employ'd, and in the Re∣turns
made from thence, as also the vast
Wealth acquir'd there in Plantations, Build∣ings,
<PB N="139" REF="171"/>
Value of Lands, Slaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it
is a Doubt not easily resolv'd, whether is
greater in real Value, the Silver returned
to <HI>Spain</HI> yearly by the Galleons, or the Su∣gars,
Ginger, Tobacco, Rice, Furrs, Fish, and
other Product of <HI>America</HI> returned to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and to other Parts on <HI>English</HI> Account.</P>
<P>TO such an immense Greatness is the
Trade grown, such a Consumption is made
of the <HI>English</HI> Merchandizes, such Cities
and Towns are built, Countries, nay King∣doms
peopled and inhabited, and such a
Fund of Wealth and Commerce is raised,
that it is not to be estimated.</P>
<P>4. IN the same enterprising Times, was
the Trade to the <HI>Gold Coast</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI>
begun; a Trade founded upon the most: clear
Principles of Commerce; namely, the mean∣est
Export exchang'd for the richest Re∣turn;
a Trade carry'd on with surprising
Success, while justly countenanc'd by the
Authority which own'd its beginning; and
a Trade still holding up its Head, tho' so
strangely, unaccountably, and contrary to
the true Interest of Trade in general,
as well as of <HI>England</HI> in particular, aban∣don'd
and forsaken at last! And I ask leave
to say, I think 'tis the only national Advan∣tage
in Commerce, which seems to be neg∣lected
in <HI>England;</HI> it waits, however, for
better Times; and I cannot doubt, but as
it is capable (were it freed from the Inva∣sions
of Interlopers) of being made the
<PB N="140" REF="172"/>
most flourishing Trade of its kind in the
World; so it will still recover it self, and
flourish in a manner few People expect,
because they do not see it possible; which
however, I shall demonstrate, upon proper
Oecasion, to be both possible and easy.</P>
<P>5. BESIDES all these particular Steps
taken for the Encrease of Trade, the Ex∣port
of the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures to <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
mention'd above, took its beginning
in this Queen's Reign, by the natural Con∣sequence
of the commanding Influence the
Queen had over all the Affairs, as well as
in the Affections of the <HI>Dutch:</HI> The
<HI>Hollanders</HI> ador'd the Queen, and esteem'd
her, as she really was, their great Patro∣ness
and Protector, and in Return, they
omitted nothing that would oblige her, or
her People; and particularly the encou∣raging
and propagating the Consumption
of the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture was their par∣ticular
Care, knowing they could do no∣thing
that could oblige her Majesty more.</P>
<P>THIS Part was indeed one of the main
Articles, in which the Growth of the Manu∣facture
at that Time consisted; for as to the
rest, tho' they were Foundations on which
the future Greatness of the Manufacture
of Wool was very much rais'd; yet, as I
said of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII's Part, so it was
here, it was many Years, and not till long
after the Queen's Death, that the Harvest
of that Spring Time of Trade was reap'd.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="173"/>
<HI>N. B.</HI> The Success of those glorious
Attempts for the Encrease of Com∣merce,
and the generous Care for the
Prosperity of the Nation, tho' the Issue
could not be seen, or the Advantage be
reap'd till some Ages after, is a noble
Patern for the Princes, and for the Legi∣slature
of the present Age; moving them
to lay such Foundations, as present
themselves for the future Advantage
of their Subjects, tho' the Benefit should
not immediately be felt, and tho' the
Prospect be something remote, of which
something farther remains in the De∣sign
of this Work.</P>
<P>THESE, I say, were the Beginnings of
foreign Trade in <HI>England,</HI> and from hence
the home Manufacturers rais'd themselves:
These were the Beginnings, upon which the
immense Business carry'd on in <HI>England</HI> at
this time has been rais'd: This was the Time,
when (as I said above) <HI>England</HI> gave her∣self
a loose in Trade, and got the Start of
all her Neighbours, and like a strong
Horse in a Race, who having shot a Head
of the rest at their first setting out, by the
Skill of the Rider, holds it all the way, by
meer Strength, as well as Speed.</P>
<P>THE Advantages gain'd by the War with
<HI>Spain,</HI> gave <HI>England</HI> such a Start of her
Neighbours in this single Reign, in mat∣ters
of Commerce, as the whole World
could never overtake her in to this Day;
<PB N="142" REF="174"/>
the Discoveries made in <HI>America</HI> are an
Example of this; <HI>England</HI> began, and be∣ing
early, carv'd for her self, nor did she
lose her Time; the <HI>French</HI> put in as soon
as they perceiv'd it, but found all the
North Coast of <HI>America</HI> gone, and possest
by the <HI>English,</HI> and were glad to take up
with what was left, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to run into the
great and dangerous Gulph of St. <HI>Law∣rence,</HI>
take up with the frozen and
wild Countries of <HI>Canada,</HI> and plant be∣hind
the <HI>English,</HI> remote from the Sea, and
out of the Way of Commerce, except by
that one Port; by all which Inconveniences
they have been always so crampt in Trade,
they have made but mean Advances in a
Hundred and fifty Years Possession: As to
their <HI>Louisiana</HI> and <HI>Mississipi,</HI> it has indeed
been made a Bubble at Home, and but little
better Abroad, having only starv'd, or o∣therwise
devour'd most of the People that
have been sent over to it.</P>
<P>AMONG the Islands the <HI>French</HI> came a
little more timely, and so got a better Share
than any other of their Neighbours, except
the <HI>English;</HI> for they got <HI>Martinico
Guadaloup, Tortuga,</HI> and a part of St. <HI>Chri∣stopher,</HI>'s
and several other Places, which
they prositably hold to this Day.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> came last, got little upon
the Continent, and lost that little they had
got to the <HI>English, viz. New York,</HI> and East
and West <HI>Jersy;</HI> so that they have nothing
<PB N="143" REF="175"/>
to call their own on that Side; no, nor have
they one Island of any Consequence; they
got a footing in the <HI>Brasils</HI> indeed, and
held it above twenty Years, but were driven
out of it again by plain Force, even by the
<HI>Portuguese:</HI> Those very People, who on
other Occasions they so much contemned,
and who, in other Places, they drove before
them, as Wolves disperse a Flock of Sheep.</P>
<P>ALL they have now left in <HI>America,</HI> is
the two small Colonies of <HI>Surinam</HI> and
<HI>Curacao,</HI> of no Import, or worth naming,
and hardly worth their keeping, except for a
clandestine Trade carried on there with the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Caraccas;</HI> which is
now also likely to be entirely lost, and then
the Intrinsick of the Product will be their
only Benefit, which will appear very small.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, How are these Colo∣nies
of the <HI>English</HI> increas'd and improv'd,
even to such a Degree, that some have sug∣gested,
tho' not for Want of Ignorance, a
Danger of their revolting from the <HI>English</HI>
Government, and setting up an Indepen∣dency
of Power for themselves.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Notion is absurd, and
without Foundation, but serves to confirm
what I. have said above of the real En∣crease
of those Colonies, and of the flou∣rishing
Condition of the Commerce car∣ried
on there.</P>
<P>HOW great a Consumption of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Manufacture has the Encrease of these
<PB N="144" REF="176"/>
Colonies been to this Nation? Let the year∣ly
Export of all Kinds of Goods from hence
to <HI>New-England, Virginia, Barbadoes,</HI>
and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> besides all the lesser Colo∣nies,
be a Proof of it: Above a Thousand
Sail of stout Ships are constantly running be∣tween
<HI>England</HI> and those Countries, above
another Thousand are employed in coasting
and traversing the Seas between the Islands
and the Continent, including the Fishing
Trade; besides the Numbers of Sloops con∣tinually
waiting upon the Trade in <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI>
which they tell us are double the
Number of all the rest.</P>
<P>I have omitted the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> as
an Article made so much less advantageous
to <HI>England,</HI> by our own Mismanagement,
than it might have been, that I see but little
to boast of in it: But the general Com∣merce
is my Business, especially in those
Parts where our Manufactures are particu∣larly
concerned.</P>
<P>THE next to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> (with whom we
carry on such an immense Trade, that it
was affirm'd to the Parliament in a particu∣lar
Debate upon that Subject, that they
took off two Millions yearly of our Wool∣len
Manufacture only) I say, next to these
our Trade with <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and the <HI>Baltick</HI>
has been carried on to such an exceeding
Degree, and so encreased of late, that not∣withstanding
several Prohibitions and Inva∣sions
upon the Manufacture lately appearing
<PB N="145" REF="177"/>
in <HI>Germany,</HI> in Bar of our Manufacture,
our Trade thither is yet superior to all the
other Nations; and in a Word is so great,
as perhaps is beyond all Conjecture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade has been carried on
in the most regular Manner imaginable,
from its first Establishment spoken of above:
Its Encrease is visible, and as the Returns are
to be duly estimated, and we can make it
appear to be encreased, from thirty or forty
Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> a Year, to up∣wards
of 300000 /. Value in a Year.</P>
<P>The Export of our Manufacture to
<HI>Italy, France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and particu∣larly
to <HI>Portugal,</HI> how are they advanc'd
upon the first Establishment made in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Time: It is true, <HI>France,</HI>
by our egregious Folly, is lost to us in some
Sense; but how it is in <HI>Portugal,</HI> by the
Encrease of their Colonies in the <HI>Brasils,</HI>
and on both the Coasts of <HI>Africa</HI> South
of the Line; I say, how has the Consump∣tion
of the <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manufacture
encreased among them; so that I am assur'd
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> alone take off more <HI>English</HI>
Woollen Manufacture at this Time, than ever
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> put together, took off
from us before.</P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>Italy,</HI> especially to <HI>Leg∣horn</HI>
and <HI>Genoa, Messina</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> is
the same, and under the same Proportion
of Improvement. To this Prodigy of Mag∣nitude
is the <HI>British</HI> Manufacture arriv'd,
<PB N="146" REF="178"/>
and all built upon the solid Foundations
layd by that glorious Princess: She opened
all these Doors, she sent out all those Ad∣venturers,
she planted all those Colonies,
or made Way for the planting them; she
circled the Globe by her Mariners, she
founded the Commerce of both the <HI>Indies,</HI>
of <HI>Africa,</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the
<HI>Levant,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>SHE did not live indeed to see the Ani∣mosity
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> War abated, much
less brought to an End, or the Haughtiness
of that proud Nation humbled into a settled
Friendship and Commerce, as was after∣wards
done; but it was all founded on
her Conduct; for Example,</P>
<P>ON the Foot of her Establishments, the
<HI>American</HI> Colonies are since brought to
that flourishing State in which we now see
they stand; on her laying the Foundation
of the <HI>Turkey,</HI> the <HI>East India,</HI> the <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
and the <HI>East Country</HI> Trades, they
are grown up to what we now see them.</P>
<P>BUT above all, and what I have not
mentioned before, the Naval Glory of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
is all raised upon her prudent exerting
her Strength at Sea; she shew'd the <HI>Spani∣ard,</HI>
that however superior his Forces were
on Shore (and it must be allowed his Ar∣mies
were at that Time formidable, and
his Troops, as well as his Generals, the best
in the World) yet, <HI>I say,</HI> her Maje∣sty
shew'd him, that her Wooden Walls were
<PB N="147" REF="179"/>
her sufficient Defence; that she built her
Strength for War as well as for Commerce,
upon the invincible Power of her Fleets,
and the Courage and Bravery of her Sea∣men.
By this she carried her Arms to the
Doors of her Enemies, and visited them
with her Terrors in their remotest Situ∣ation.</P>
<P>By these she took <HI>Cadiz,</HI> burnt the
<HI>Galleons,</HI> with twenty Millions of Trea∣sure
in them, insulted <HI>Lisbon,</HI> (then in the
Hands of <HI>Spain</HI>) ravaged the Coast of
<HI>Galitia,</HI> and in a Word made all <HI>Spain</HI>
tremble: By these she seiz'd the Islands
and planted the Continent, landed upon the
Coasts, plundered the Cities, destroyed the
Shipping, and took immense Wealth from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, she cover'd the Seas with
her Men of War, and like King <HI>George,</HI>
let the Enemies of <HI>England</HI> see, that they
that command the Sea, awe the World, and
that to be Masters of the marine Power, is to
be Masters of all the Power, and all the
Commerce in <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> and
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>NOR was this all, but the <HI>Queen</HI> by thus ex∣erting
her Naval Power, encreas'd it; nay, she
took the best and the only Way to enlarge
and encrease it; the Success at Sea made Sea∣men,
as her Success in Trade made Merchants:
To speak the Truth, all her Subjects were
fir'd with new Thoughts; the very No∣bility,
<PB N="148" REF="180"/>
and first Rate Gentlemen, fell into
it, the <HI>Cliffords</HI> Earls of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> Sir
<HI>John Hawkins,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish,</HI> Sir
<HI>Richard Greenville</HI> of the <HI>Devonshire</HI> Fa∣mily,
since Earls of <HI>Bath,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI>
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and Multitudes more:
Some commanded Ships, some Troops; some
planted Colonies, some supply'd Stocks;
some ventur'd their Lives, some their
Estates; all something: The Trade, the
War, the Sea, emulated one another; all
the Nation was in a kind of Flame.</P>
<P>THE Seamen returned enriched with the
Plunder, not of Ships, but of Fleets, Loa∣den
with Silver; they went out Beggars,
and came home Gentlemen; nay, the
Wealth they brought Home, not only en∣rich'd
themselves, but the whole Nation.</P>
<P>THIS made the People run to Sea, as
Country Folks to a Fair; and all the young
Fellows turn'd Seamen as naturally as if they
had been born so: The Multitude of
Ships and Sailors in <HI>England</HI> grew so great,
that, in a Word, they, as it were, covered
the Seas; every Part of the World was vi∣sited,
and the Queen reign'd as it were
Mistress the Ocean; nor do we learn by
History or Tradition, that the Queen ever
prest any Seamen; Her glorious Successes at
Sea both in publick and private Adventures,
animated her People so, that they crouded
into the Service on all Hands; and whatever
<PB N="149" REF="181"/>
Adventure was on Foot, they never wan∣ted
Hands.</P>
<P>THUS the Queen, I say, by exerting her
Naval Strength, encreased it; and that to
such a Degree, that no Power on Earth,
during her whole Reign, was able to match
her at Sea; nay, I believe I do not carry
it too far, if I say, she was at that Time able
to have fought all the Maritime Powers of
Christendom at Sea, had they been all in
Confederacy together; and this I speak of
the Number of her Seamen and Ships, not
at all insisting on the Goodness of her Sea∣men;
tho' it must be allow'd, that her Sea∣men,
flush'd with <HI>Spanish</HI> Prizes, were the
best and the boldest at that Time, of any
Sailors in the World: But that is a Subject
by it self.</P>
<P>I return to the Subject; as it is now,
so it was then; <HI>Spain</HI> could not bring
home her <HI>American</HI> Treasures, without her
Majesty's Leave; and with this addition
too, that almost as often as they ventur'd
to do it, they miscarried; which has not
yet been our Case.</P>
<P>HERE began the formidable Strength,
as well as Trade of <HI>England,</HI> to shew it self,
the World scarce ever heard of an <HI>English</HI>
Navy till then; the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the
fifth had powerful Fleets, when he carried
on his Wars with so much Glory against
<HI>France,</HI> against the <HI>Turks</HI> (then very for∣midable
at Sea) and against the Rovers of
<PB N="150" REF="182"/>
<HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Algier;</HI> and his Son King <HI>Philip</HI>
had indeed great Navies, when he car∣ried
on his Wars against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> not
then form'd into a State; and when he fit∣ted
that terrible Fleet against <HI>England,</HI>
called <HI>Invincible,</HI> and which had been
truly invincible, had not Heaven and
Earth, as it were, fought against it in Con∣junction.</P>
<P>BUT the World scarce ever heard of an
<HI>English</HI> Man of War (so by the Iniquity
of Custom we call our Ships of War)
much less of an <HI>English</HI> Navy till Queen
<HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>WITH our naval Power grew up our
Commerce, as if like Twins they were born
together, and not to live asunder: What
had been all her new settled Plantations,
all her Infant Colonies? they had Difficul∣ties
almost unsurmountable in their very
Beginning, Difficulties found in the very
Nature of their Undertakings, and which
follow'd in the Consequence of the Thing;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) planting among the barbarous Nations,
and lying at the Mercy of the Savages: How
often famish'd, and frozen to Death by the
Severity of the Climates, and Want of Sup∣plies?
How often massacred by the treache∣rous
Natives? How often driven, to aban∣don
the Settlements they had made? And
had the <HI>Spaniard</HI> too been able to have at∣tack'd
them by Sea, had not the Queen al∣ways
kept herself in a Condition to defend
<PB N="151" REF="183"/>
them, and to protect their Commerce, all
the Discoveries they had made, and the
Colonies they had planted, like ill Births
had been strangled in the bringing forth;
and all had fallen back to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
by the meer Consequence of their Naval
Power.</P>
<P>BUT the Queen was the Life of all that
Glory; her adventurous Subjects found out
the Places, planted and settled them, and as
well as they could, fortified themselves a∣gainst
the Bow and Arrow Enemies, which
they found in the Place.</P>
<P>BUT 'twas the Queen's <HI>Naval Strength</HI>
that was their Security; by this she kept
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Hands full, that they had no
Time to bestow in attacking the newly
planted Merchants; nor had they Ships to
spare, they were met with in every Cor∣ner,
fought with on every Coast, and which
was more, beaten almost as often as fought
with, on whatever Occasion.</P>
<P>UNDER this Protection the Commerce
encreased, Trade got Ground, the <HI>English</HI>
Nation swelled into an Empire of Nations,
and the <HI>English</HI> Merchants carried a ge∣neral
Negoce to all the Quarters of the
World.</P>
<P>HAVING thus look'd back a little upon
Things past, I shall say a Word or two to
Things present, and conclude with Things
yet to come.</P>

<PB REF="184"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the present State of the English
Commerce, especially that Part of
it which relates to the woollen Ma∣nufacture;
the Prodigy of its Mag∣nitude,
and some Enquiry into how
it may be call'd great, and what
that Magnitude really is.</HEAD>
<P>_ BY what has been said, we are a
little let into the Beginning of
Things, and <HI>English</HI> Men of
Trade may see their glorious Ori∣ginal;
how they receiv'd Life, as we may
call it, from the Powerful Influences, and
Paternal Concern of their sagacious Princes;
and how they became a trading Nation.
Take a Summary of it again in the following
Abstract.</P>
<P>HEAVEN bestow'd the Wool upon them,
the Life and Soul, the Original of all their
Commerce; he gave it them, and gave It
exclusive of all the Nations in the World;
for none comes up to it.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="185"/>
<HI>Their King (Henry</HI> VII.) open'd their
Eyes to the Blessing, and put them upon
manufacturing it, aster they had, for almost
a Thousand Years of Ignorance, sold it to
the diligent <HI>Flemings;</HI> and even bought
their own Cloaths of them again, after they
were made with it Abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Their</HI> glorious <HI>Queen, (Elizabeth</HI>) shew∣ed
them the Way to find a Market for it,
when manufactur'd; she open'd the Sluices
of Trade to them, and Trade open'd the
Sluices of Money. In a Word, she made
them a Trading Nation, and that has made
them a rich Nation, as we see them at this
Time.</P>
<P>BUT I am called upon to describe the
Magnitude of this Commerce, and shew
the World, that we do not boast of its
Greatness without Cause; that Strangers
may know, what we say of it, is not made
up of Bluster and Wind, and that even those
that read it among our own People, may be
able to support and explain what they shall,
upon any Occasion, advance of the real
Greatness of our Trade.</P>
<P>THE Funds of Trade in any Nation, and
upon which the Commerce that is rais'd,
is with Propriety said to be the Trade of
that Nation, must be contain'd in these
Two.</P>
<P>THE Produce of the Soil, and,
THE Labour of the People.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="186"/>
Now, if I make it appear, that in both these
the Trade of <HI>England</HI> is greater than that
of any other Nation, I hope I may be sup∣posed
sufficiently to have prov'd the Mag∣nitude
of it.</P>
<P>1. THE Produce of the Soil.</P>
<P>AND here, that I may make all Things
plain and easy as I go, and leave as little
Room for Cavil as possible, I demand
to explain briefly the Term <HI>Product</HI> or Pro∣duce:
By Produce, as to Trade, I am to be
understood to mean, not that Part of our
Produce, be it of what Kind it will, that is
consumed at Home, and is employ'd by our
People; for this does not relate to the Trade
of the Kingdom, as I understand Trade in
this Discourse; that is to say, Our foreign
Trade: By this Exception I take out all the
vast Consumption of Corn, Cattle, Coal,
Fish, Fowl, or whatever of our own Growth
is consum'd unmanufactur'd; and tho' this
makes an inexpressible Sum, and employs a
Multitude of those of our People we call
Shop-keepers, Carriers, Coasting Sailors,
with Servants, Labourers and Horses; Ships,
Barges Boats, Carts and Carriages in∣numerable,
and that a vast Wealth is raised
by this part of Trade; yet, I say, this is not
the Article, or Branch of our Trade that I am
in particular now describing: But by the
Produce of the Soil here, I mean such part
of its Growth as is exported beyond the
<PB N="155" REF="187"/>
Seas. What is consum'd at Home, will
come under another Head. This includes,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WOOL, the greatest and best of our
trading Produce, the Soul and Life of our
whole Commerce, and the Fund of all our
Prosperity and Success in that Commerce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. CORN, so much as is exported only.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. COALS and Leather, also exported.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 TIN and Lead, Iron and Copper.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. FISH and Salt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>I suppose no thinking Man will object that
Fish being the Produce of the Sea, and not
of the Soil, is not to be call'd a Produce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Tobacco, Sugars
and Ginger.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Rum, Melasses,
Indigo.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Cocoa, Pimento,
and Drugs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Furrs and Skins
of Beasts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10 Turpentine, Rice,
Cotton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Timber, Masts,
and Planks.
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Produce of our
Colonies, which is
the same Thing as
our own Produce.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE Magnitude of our Trade, founded
upon these Productions, will appear, when
they are considered apart, and when the La∣bour
of the People, being added to the Va∣lue,
shall so far double and redouble the
<PB N="156" REF="188"/>
Sum, as the Nature of the Things respe∣ctively
shall admit.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Labour of the People</HI> is the next
Article. This is supposed to be rated accor∣ding
to the Thing they labour about, and
is to be added to the intrinsick Value of the
Materials; which being so join'd, the Work
finish'd is call'd Manufacture.</P>
<P>1. The Wool, as it is the first and greatest
Produce, so it is the first and principal Ma∣nufacture;
an Estimate of its Value, as
Wool, is as difficult to be made, as of its
Quantity; the Numbers of People it em∣ploys
are not to be reckon'd by Thousands,
but by Millions; the Places in <HI>Britain</HI>
where the Work is managed and carried on,
are not to be measured by Towns, and Di∣stricts
of Towns, Villages, or Lordships,
but by Counties, Provinces, Parts and
Quarters of the Island: As it is a Product
every where; so every where we see more
or less of the People employ'd in it: The
best Measure we can take to give you an
Idea of its Magnitude, is to tell you, that
it works up, and consumes not only all the
Wool produced by the Sheep of this whole
Island, the <HI>Cattle upon a thousand Hills,</HI>
but it calls for a prodigious quantity from
Abroad.</P>
<P>N. B. I suppose I am much within Com∣pass,
when I say, that in the Fleece
and in Yarn, we import 100000 Packs
of Wool every year from <HI>Ireland,</HI> be∣sides
<PB N="157" REF="189"/>
all the Wool of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which,
since the Union, is generally brought
to <HI>England,</HI> to be manufactured; and
whose Quantity, as represented at the
Time of that Treaty, was rated in the
Parliament there, to be worth 60000
Pound Sterling <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>They that would examine into the Quan∣tity
of Wool used in <HI>England,</HI> must make an
Estimate of the Numbers of the Sheep fed
here, which it would be very hard to do;
but let them view the Country where those
Sheep are generally rais'd and fed, or enquire
of those who have view'd it critically, and
let them see the innumerable Flocks of Sheep
fed constantly in the several Parts of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
following.</P>
<P>I <HI>Romney Marsh,</HI> an Extent of Land for
about 20 Miles long, and 10 Miles broad,
of the best and richest kind of Sheep Ground.
I name this Place first, because I can give
an authentick Account of its Extent, and
from thence may give you likewise some∣thing
more than a rough Guess at the Pro∣duce
of it in Wool.</P>
<P>THE Flat Country, commonly call'd
<HI>Romney Marsh,</HI> includes some other Lands
of the same Nature, and lying all in the
same Level, but of which <HI>Romney</HI> is the
Chief, and therefore gives its Name to all
the rest, the Quantities of Land they con∣tain,
and upon which they are rated in their
Level Books, stand thus.</P>

<LABEL>New Romney Level</LABEL>
<ITEM>292</ITEM>
<LABEL></LABEL>
<ITEM>47110</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THE ordinary Bounds of this great Level,
are by Estimation, from <HI>Rye Harbour,</HI> or
<HI>Guldford Marsh,</HI> East to the Town or Port
of <HI>Hithe</HI> West, 20 Miles, and from South
to North; that is to say, from <HI>Lyd</HI> on the
Sea Shore South, to <HI>Warchorn</HI> North, which
is suppos'd to be a Medium of the Breadth,
at least ten Miles.</P>
<P>As all (or all to a Trifle of) this Land, is
employ'd in breeding and feeding of Sheep,
they reckon the stated Number of Sheep to
Stock, the whole, that is to say, of Wea∣thers
and Ewes, which produce Fleece
Wool, is three Sheep to an Acre.</P>
<P>N. B. THE Lambs, of which a very
great Number, are every Year sold off,
are not included.</P>
<P>So that the Number of Sheep, and conse∣quently
the Number of Fleeces of Wool
raised in this <HI>Level,</HI> is 141330 Fleeces.</P>
<P>OF these 'tis usually reckon'd, that 14
Fleeces, one with another, make a Draft,
and four Drafts make a Pack of Wool; so
<PB N="158" REF="191"/>
that 56 Fleeces make a Pack, each Pack
weighing 240 Pound; and, thus</P>
<P>THE Total of the yearly Growth of
Fleece Wool in this <HI>Level,</HI> is 2523 Packs
23 Fleeces.</P>
<P>I could give many more Estimates of par∣ticular
Places after the like manner; but, as
all together will not amount to an exact
Calculate, I shall not trouble the Reader
with Figures. This is sufficient to give you
some just Ideas of the rest, after I have a
little describ'd the Countries where the Prin∣cipal
Numbers of Sheep are kept.</P>
<P>2. THE South <HI>Downs;</HI> an Extent of Car∣pet
Ground, reaching from <HI>Bourn</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI>
to near <HI>Chichester,</HI> and with small Intervals
to <HI>Post Down</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> being at least
65 Miles in length, and generally 5 or 6
Miles broad at a Medium; all covered with
Sheep of a smaller Size, but of the finest
Wool; in which Compass I find there is
estimated above 70000 Acres.</P>
<P>3. THE <HI>Downs</HI> and <HI>Plains,</HI> vulgarly call'd
<HI>Salisbury Plains,</HI> but extending from about
10 Miles on this side <HI>Winchester,</HI> to the <HI>Divi∣zes</HI>
East and West, and from <HI>Andover</HI> on the
Edge of <HI>Berkshire,</HI> through the whole
Counties of <HI>Wilts</HI> and <HI>Dorset</HI> to the Sea at
<HI>Weymouth,</HI> North and South; containing all,
or the most Part of the large Counties of
<HI>Southampton;</HI> besides, as above, that of <HI>Wilts</HI>
and <HI>Dorset,</HI> the Number of Acres not to
<PB N="160" REF="192"/>
be estimated, and the Sheep not to be
guessed at.</P>
<P>4. THE <HI>Cotswould</HI> Hills and the Plains ad∣joining,
in the Counties of <HI>Worcester, Glou∣cester</HI>
and <HI>Oxford;</HI> all these last Counties
breed an infinite Number of Sheep.</P>
<P>5. THE County of <HI>Surry</HI> breeds a very
great Number on <HI>Bansted Downs;</HI> and also on
the vast extended Commons and Heaths on
the West Part of the same Country, towards
<HI>Farnham, Guildford,</HI> and the <HI>Hind Head
Hills,</HI> all to be seen on the Road to <HI>Ports∣mouth.</HI></P>
<P>6. THE two rich feeding Counties of <HI>Lin∣coln</HI>
and <HI>Leicester,</HI> where the largest Sheep
in <HI>England</HI> are bred, and from whence
comes that innumerable Store which supplies
the Markets of <HI>London</HI> with their Flesh,
whose Number admits of no Calculation.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Newmarket Heath,</HI> and all those Downs
and Heaths adjoining in the Counties of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which reach from
<HI>Bourn Bridge</HI> on the side of <HI>Essex</HI> to <HI>Thet∣ford</HI>
North East, and on by <HI>Brandon</HI> and to
<HI>Lyn</HI> North West, and to the Sea due North,
where an innumerable Number of Sheep
are fed, noted for having all white Wool, but
black Faces.</P>
<P>I forbear to examine the Mountains of
<HI>Wales,</HI> the fine Wool of <HI>Leominster,</HI> the
<HI>Woulds</HI> in the East Riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI>
the Bank of <HI>Tees</HI> in the Bishoprick of
<HI>Durham,</HI> where are the largest Breed of
<PB N="161" REF="193"/>
Sheep in the whole Island; even larger
than in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> or <HI>Romney Marsh;</HI>
and last of all the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Sheep,
where, and in <HI>Cumberland</HI> their Number is
so great, that they are brought Southward to
be sold, even to <HI>London</HI> it self.</P>
<P>ADD to all these, that at least there is
brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> 120000 Sheep eve∣ry
Year, with the Wool upon their Backs,
besides Wool, as I said before, of all the
numberless Flocks that are left behind, in
the Shires of <HI>Galloway, Air, Nithsdale,
Tiviotdale,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be foreign to our purpose, to
mention these particular Sheep Countries,
if there were not something material in it,
to those <HI>English</HI> Men who are acquainted a
little with their own Country; and who
by reflecting on the Quantities of Sheep,
may make some Guess at the prodigious
Quantity of Wool produced by them; as
an Illustration of which, be pleas'd to ob∣serve.</P>
<P>1. THAT at <HI>Dorchester,</HI> the County
Town of <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> abovemention'd, I
was told by very grave and creditable Per∣sons,
Inhabitants of that Town, that upon
a Wager decided, it was made appear, that
within a Circle drawn round the Town,
six Miles every Way; that is, twelve
Miles Diameter, placing the Town exclu∣sive
in the Center, there were 600000 Sheep
<PB N="162" REF="194"/>
feeding at that one Time, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>June,
Anno</HI> 1673.</P>
<P>2. THAT at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> I received an
Account from Persons alike grave and ju∣dicious,
that there were sold, or brought to
be sold, at one Time at <HI>Wey-hill</HI> Fair,
400000 Sheep; and at <HI>Burford</HI> Fair in
<HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> the same Year, upwards of
600000.</P>
<P>THE Sum of this Account is, that as the
Number of Sheep, which are constantly kept
in this Island, is so exceeding great, and as
we may say, numberless; so must the
Growth of the Wool be yearly in Propor∣tion;
and how great then must be the
Manufacture, which not only works the
Wool always up, but receives such immense
Quantities from <HI>Ireland</HI> and from <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>THE next Consideration upon which,
to form an Idea of the Greatness of our
woollen Manufacture, is the Exportation
of it, and the several Markets where it is
sold: For Example,</P>
<P>THE Markets for <HI>English</HI> broad Cloths
in <HI>Turky,</HI> viz. at <HI>Constantinople, Smyrna,
Scanderoon, Aleppo,</HI> and at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>THE Staple at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the Fairs at
<HI>Leipsic</HI> and <HI>Frankfort au Main,</HI> and the
Markets of <HI>Ausburgh, Nuremburgh, Ʋlm,</HI>
and many of the most considerable Cities
of the upper, as well as the lower <HI>Ger∣many.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="195"/>
THE great Quantity of <HI>English</HI> Ma∣nufacture
sold yearly at <HI>Lubec, Gottenburgh,
Stockholm, Straelsand, Stetin, Konings∣burgh,
Dantzick, Riga</HI> and <HI>Petersburgh;</HI>
and this, notwithstanding all the Prohibi∣tions,
and pretended Imitations of our
Manufacture in <HI>Sweden, Prussia, Saxony</HI>
and <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>THE incredible Vent for the woollen
Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> which is now
actually in <HI>Holland,</HI> as well at <HI>Rotterdam</HI>
as at <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> and from thence it is
sent to all the Provinces and Counties of
<HI>Germany;</HI> which, as I have said above, is
said to amount to above two Millions Ster∣ling
<HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>THE lately encreas'd Market at <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
where, notwithstanding all that has been
said of the <HI>French</HI> supplying them, we
have so great a Vent for the woollen Ma∣nufacture,
that 'tis said, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade
is at this Time the best, and most entire
Trade we have.</P>
<P>THE Trade to <HI>Spain,</HI> as well old as new,
and to <HI>Italy;</HI> however, the first has been
interrupted, either by clandestine or Per∣mission'd
Traders: I say, it is very con∣siderable;
and it is observable, that our
Importation of woollen Manufactures into
old <HI>Spain,</HI> much over-ballances all the
Goods we bring back from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
their Bullion only excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="196"/>
THE Trade to <HI>India,</HI> with all its Faults,
in which the Company oblige themselves
to export yearly, the Value of 100000.
Pound in woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>ADD to all this, the Consumption in our
own Colonies and Plantations, which, as
has been already observ'd, is beyond the
reach of all Calculation.</P>
<P>THUS far relates to the first Article of
the Employment or Labour of the Poor,
<HI>viz.</HI> the woollen Manufacture only.</P>
<P>2. THE Silk Manufacture; this is en∣creas'd
in <HI>England</HI> within a few Years to
such a Degree, that whereas it was assert∣ed
by the late Dr. <HI>d'Avenant,</HI> and others,
that in the Years 1680, 1681, 1682, there
was imported yearly, by a Medium of three
Years, above 1200000 Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI>
Sterling in Value, in wrought Silks from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> I am assured, that at
this Time, there are not twelve thousand
Pounds first Cost, imported in a Year from
<HI>France,</HI> and from <HI>Italy</HI> less than ever, ex∣cept
what may be run in by Smuggling,
which, we have Reason to believe, is not
considerable: It is true, this is a Manu∣facture
wrought from foreign Materials;
but it has two Particulars attending, ex∣tremely
advantageous in Trade, and which
ballances all that can be said against it.</P>
<P>1. THAT the foreign Materials are such
as are imported manifestly in Return for
our Manufacture exported; as particularly
<PB N="165" REF="197"/>
the Raw-Silk from <HI>Turky</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI>
and the Thrown-Silk from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Si∣cily.</HI></P>
<P>2. THAT the Labour of our own Peo∣ple
is employ'd on the making those Goods,
which, however they may be consum'd at
Home, yet, would otherwise be bought
from Foreigners with our Money; so that
by this Labour of our People, the Sum of
more than a Million Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI> is
sav'd; if it is not gain'd, 'tis kept at home,
instead of being sent abroad, and the Bal∣lance
of our foreign Trade turn'd so much
the more in our Favour.</P>
<P>THUS far the Consumption at home is
made a Branch of our Gain; and the La∣bour
of the People, tho' expended by the same
People, is made a means to keep a Million
of Money at home, which would other wise
go aboad in Levity and Trifles.</P>
<P>BUT I return to foreign Trade.</P>
<P>3. THE Labour of our People is con∣cern'd
in foreign Trade, in all our Hard∣Ware
Manufactures, so far as those Hard∣Ware
Manufactures are exported; and this,
if cast up in Form, and containing all
our wrought Iron, Copper and Brass, and
wrought Pewter, is a very great Article in the
general Commerce; besides the many thou∣sand
Families employ'd in the Mines, in
digging Lead, Tin, Iron, Copper and Coal,
for Exportation; that is to say, the Lead in
Sows or Pigs, call it as you please, the
<PB N="166" REF="198"/>
Tin in Blocks, and the Copper in Bars and
Plates.</P>
<P>4. THE Labour of the People in the Fishe∣ry
of all Sorts, in which, tho' we do not
come up to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who they tell us
employ 10000 Seamen every Year in the
Whale Fishing, and 10000 more in the
Herring Fishing, and 10000 more in all
their other Fishing, including the fetch∣ing
Salt from St. <HI>Ʋvies;</HI> yet, it is certain,
that next to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> we have more
Men employ'd in the taking and curing
of Fish, including the <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and
<HI>New-England</HI> Fishing, than all the World
besides.</P>
<P>5. ADD to this, that <HI>England</HI> employs,
without Question, more Shipping than any
other Nation, even than the <HI>Dutch</HI> them∣selves;
and consequently more Seamen, and
Builders of Ships; for tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
an infinite Number of small Craft, such as
Galliots, Hoys, Busses, and Bylanders or
Hoys, for their River Navigation, in which
they and the <HI>Flemings</HI> out-do all the <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
World; yet sor great Ships, and
Ships of Force sor the Merchants Trade,
they cannot come near us; our coasting
Trade for Coals, our <HI>West-India, Spanish,</HI>
and <HI>Straits</HI> Trade, which is all carry'd on
in large Ships, carrying from ten to thirty
Guns, or able to carry so many, and some
36 to 40 Guns, especially the Trade to <HI>Vir∣ginia,
Jamaica, Barbadoes, Spain, Italy</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="199"/>
and <HI>Turkey,</HI> in which many Ships are em∣ploy'd,
which, in times of a sudden Rupture,
have been hir'd and taken up for Ships of
War, and are very fit to be so.</P>
<P>HERS the Strength, as well as the Wealth
of this Island, is discovered; and I need not
add, that out of this extraordinary Number
of Ships employ'd in our Commerce, the
Government, with very little Compulsi∣on,
and less now than ever, is able to man
any Squadron of Ships of War; nay, if
need be, the whole royal Navy with unex∣ampled
Expedition.</P>
<P>And this is another unanswerable convin∣cing
Argument to prove the Magnitude of
the <HI>English</HI> Commerce, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that if the
King wants 20000 to 30000 Seamen for the
Fleet, they are always to be had; the Trade
supplies them, and the continued Train of
homeward bound Ships produces them, and
yet the Merchants always find Men for
their Business; on the other hand, if
Peace returns, and the Royal Navy lies up,
if 20000 Seamen are dismiss'd and paid off,
they are gone in a few Minutes, they find a
Birth, (as they call it) in Trade, the Mer∣chants
fit out the more Ships, and good Sea∣men
never want Business.</P>
<P>THIS could never be, if the <HI>British</HI>
Trade was not a Prodigy for its Magnitude;
what Difficulties was the late King of <HI>France,</HI>
a Prince born to surmount all Difficulties,
I say, what Shifts was he put to to find, or
<PB N="168" REF="200"/>
rather to make Seamen to man his Ships at
the beginning of his late fatal Greatness?
How did he oblige all his Merchant Ships to
carry more Men than their Complement
(or Compleatment) to Sea upon every Voy∣age?
and besides that, a certain Number still
more upon the King's Account, and paid
by the Royal Treasury, that those Men be∣ing
inur'd to the Sea, might be afterwards
fit for his Service.</P>
<P>HOW did he invite foreign Sailors, espe∣cially
<HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> to serve in his Fleet,
by Offers of Preferment, and extraordinary
Wages, manning his best Ships with such,
because he found them better and more ex∣perienc'd
Seamen than his own Subjects?</P>
<P>EVEN the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves, if a War
presents, as was the Case more than once in
their former Wars with <HI>England,</HI> and was in
1689, and 1690, are oblig'd to stop their
<HI>Greenland</HI> Fleet, and even sometimes their
Herring Fishery, or, at least, to shorten the
Number, in order to man their Fleets.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the <HI>English,</HI> some small Em∣bargoes
excepted, for a Week or ten Days
at a Time, never put a full Stop to any general
Head of Trade, for want of Seamen; on
the contrary, in the hottest Press, and
when Seamen are wanting on any sudden
Expedition, yet they grant Exemptions and
Protections, upon the ordinary Representa∣tions
of the Merchants and of the Cities
and Towns; as, to the Coal Trade from
<PB N="169" REF="201"/>
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> the Mackrel and Herring-Fish∣ing
Smacks in their Seasons, and to their
outward bound Merchants on many Occa∣sions:
And this was done in the late King
<HI>William</HI>'s Time, even when the Govern∣ment
required 40000 Seamen to man the
Fleet, and when two or three Hundred
Ships at a Time were employed in the
Transport Service to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other
Places.</P>
<P>How could this be, if the Magnitude
of the <HI>English</HI> Trade was not, as I have
said, a Kind of Prodigy in the World, such
as is no where now to be equalled, or was
ever before heard of?</P>
<P>THESE I take to be solid Proofs of the
general Proposition; they are no Rhodo∣montades
or Boasts; the Case does not
want such mean Helps to set it out; the
Thing is not private and conceal'd, for a
few to know and be called upon to give in
Evidence, the whole World are Witnesses;
where to the Southward of our Channel is
the Port or the Place of Trade, in <HI>Europe,
Africa</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> where among all fo∣reign
Ships that enter their Harbours, the
<HI>Engish</HI> are not the most in Number? at <HI>Lis∣bon,</HI>
at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> at <HI>Malaga,</HI> at <HI>Messina,</HI> at
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> at <HI>Zant,</HI> at <HI>Venice;</HI>
read any of the publick Advices, there is
ordinarily more <HI>English</HI> Ships, not only
than of any other Nation, but generally
more than of all the other Nations
<PB N="170" REF="202"/>
put together. The last Account I saw went
thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Lisbon
<LIST>
<ITEM>French Ships 18</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dutch 5</ITEM>
<ITEM>Swedes 2</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hamburghers 1</ITEM>

<ITEM>Leghorn
<LIST>
<ITEM>French 5</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dutch 2</ITEM>
<ITEM>English 8</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
And so of several other Ports.</P>
<P>AS for <HI>America,</HI> we see hardly any
<HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> in any of the Ports or
Places of the Country, except the <HI>French</HI>
Bankers off of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and a few
Ships at <HI>Canada;</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with all their
powerful Commerce, have scarce any Thing
to do there.</P>
<P>THESE I call Demonstrations of the
Greatness of our Commerce in general;
'tis true it is not a Detail of Particulars,
neither is it needful to our Subject.</P>
<P>I have met with some who have preten∣ded
to be critical in those Things, and have
made Estimates of the Value of the Wool∣len
Manufacture in the whole; and they
<PB N="171" REF="203"/>
have told us, that they allow it to be five
Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> exported, and two Mil∣lions
<HI>Sterling</HI> the Home Consumption.
These Calculations I take to be much of a
Piece with those general Guesses formerly
made at the Value of our old Coin; some
would have it to be three Millions, and
others four; and the last pretended to speak
with Judgment, and with a Kind of Au∣thority,
and took upon them to make the
World believe they knew something more
than common.</P>
<P>FROM this assuming positive Way they
went on, to make a Judgment of other pub∣lick
Things, as the Proportion of People,
the Value of Lands, the Number of Acres
in <HI>England,</HI> and what such and such
Taxes might raise; by all which it past
with the World as a just Calculation, that
the current Coin was 4 Millions of Silver
Money; and when upon these Presumpti∣ons
they adventur'd upon that great Work
of reforming the Coin, and calling in the
old Money, they found the Sum nearer
to twelve Millions than to four; which
Mistake plung'd the famous Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI>
afterwards Lord <HI>H—x,</HI> into unexpe∣cted
Difficulties, which required his ut∣most
Skill to go thro', and which a Genius
less than his, would have been in Danger
to have been sunk under.</P>
<P>CALCULATIONS in Cases where there
is no Principle to calculate from, no given
<PB N="172" REF="204"/>
Number or Rule to begin at, should never
obtain too much upon us; the judging
by or from such Calculations leads Men,
or otherwise great Penetration, oftentimes
into fatal Mistakes, such as at least touch
the Reputation of their Understandings
and Judgment; and sometimes such as ex∣pose
them to Contempt; such were the
Guesses of that great Pretender to politick
Arithmetick, Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> whose
Calculations of the Numbers of the Houses,
and Families, and Inhabitants in <HI>London,</HI>
and other populous Cities, were not erro∣neous
only, but we may say have been
since prov'sd absurd, and even ridiculous.</P>
<P>I give therefore no Heed to those Gues∣ses
of five Millions and two Millions, in
the Account of the Value of our Manu∣facture,
there being no Rule or Foundation
to make such an Estimate upon, and it may
be too little or too much, none knows
whether.</P>
<P>BUT all this, without Impeachment of
my general Proposition, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Mag∣nitude
of our Woollen Manufacture is a
Prodigy in Trade.</P>
<P>I must therefore be allowed here to enter
into some Comparisons, and to talk by Allu∣sion
in Behalf of this particular Branch of
our Commerce, and that is, that it is not
only prodigious great, but that it by far
out-does, and goes beyond any single Branch
of Trade, or any particular Manufacture
<PB N="173" REF="205"/>
of any other Nation, at least in these Parts
of the World.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Linen Manufacture is a
Thing so universally useful, so wanted and
called for in all Parts, that if any Thing in
the World out-does our Wool, it is the
Flax, and this I might grant, without Pre∣judice
I say to my general Proposition.</P>
<P>FOR this is not a national Manufacture,
but a Manufacture of many Nations; and
I might almost say of all Nations, even
from <HI>Egypt</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> where we
have Reason to believe it began, to <HI>Russia</HI>
at the Bottom of the <HI>Baltick;</HI> whereas the
Woollen Manufacture, as now describ'd, is
a <HI>Nostrum,</HI> a Peculiarity to <HI>England,</HI> and
to no other Country in the World, except
<HI>Ireland,</HI> which is our own.</P>
<P>THE Wool, as I have said, is an exclu∣sive
Grant from Heaven to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
'tis peculiar to this Country, and no other
Nation has it, or any thing equal to it in
the World; and the Manufacture is of Con∣sequence
singular to us also; nor do all the
Depredations made upon it by Imitation, by
Application for the getting Wool either
from us by Stealth, or from remote Coun∣tries,
as <HI>Saxony, Silesia, Poland, Barbary,</HI>
and the like, amount to much; far from so
much as <HI>England</HI> need be concerned at them;
while she has the Wool, her Trade is invul∣nerable,
at least no mortal, final, destructive
<PB N="174" REF="206"/>
Blow can be given it; of which I shall say
more in its Place.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Callico and the Silk Ma∣nufactures
in the East <HI>Indies</HI> are (at least for
<HI>Asia</HI>) an universal Manufacture; so great,
that spreading into <HI>Europe,</HI> they become
a general Grievance, and are already pro∣hibited
from being imported in several
Kingdoms and Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> the
Quantity is so great.</P>
<P>BUT these again are the Manufactures of
many Nations, Kingdoms, nay Empires of
Nations, such as the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and
of the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Gol∣conda,</HI>
of <HI>Siam,</HI> of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and many
more, too long to reckon up.</P>
<P>BUT the Woollen Manufacture, as above,
is singular to our Nation, no People in the
World can come up to us in the Workman∣ship,
or have the Materials; not that I am,
or will be partial to my Countrymen, as if
they were the Nonparels of the World for
manufacturing of Wool; 'tis evident, other
Nations would go a great Way with them
in it, if not outdo them, if they had the
Wool, the main Principle of the Manufa∣cture
to work upon; but it cannot be, they
have it not, nor can have it, the whole World
cannot supply it; they may get some Wool
in one Country, and some in another, and
too much they get clandestinely from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and much too much, from <HI>Ireland;</HI>
and with this the <HI>French</HI> make some Things
<PB N="175" REF="207"/>
very well, nor should I deny this Justice to
that diligent Nation to own, that conside∣ring
the Shifts they are put to for Wool, they
shew themselves but too good Manufactu∣rers
in making such Things as they do.</P>
<P>BUT what does it amount to? they supply
themselves perhaps, and 'tis a great Step, if
they can do that; but it must be remem∣bred,
that it is because their Government
obliges them to make Shift with it, and to
wear their own Works, however defective;
a Wisdom we cannot arrive to, tho' we have
the Manufacture in its utmost Perfection:
<HI>Of which in its Order.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, they do not supply them∣selves
neither, and in Spite of the severest
Prohibition, in Spite of Tyranny, and the
Terror of an absolute Government, they do,
and will get <HI>English</HI> Manufactures in, and
do import very great Quantities too, as I
could demonstrate by undeniable Evidences
of Fact.</P>
<P>WHAT else means the great and sudden
Export of <HI>English</HI> Goods to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> more
just after the Stop of the <HI>English</HI> Commerce
with <HI>France</HI> than ever before? what the
continued Export of the same Goods to
<HI>Dunkirk?</HI> and above all, what means the
Commerce between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> by
the <HI>Maes</HI> and the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and by the <HI>Lys</HI>
and the <HI>Scheld.</HI></P>
<P>AND why? if the <HI>French</HI> make their Ma∣nufactures
equal to others, I say, Why is it,
<PB N="176" REF="208"/>
that when the French Gentlemen make a
Tour over hither to see the Country, or
to visit the Court, they bring no more
Clothes with them, than those on their
Backs, but make them more Clothes as soon
as they come hither, and always carry se∣veral
Suits of Clothes Home with them?</P>
<P>ON the contrary, if an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman
goes Abroad into <HI>France</HI> to travel, he al∣ways
makes himself new Clothes, and car∣ries
them with him; I speak now of the
Gentlemen of Quality that do not want
Clothes, or Money to buy them.</P>
<P>THE Reason is plain, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> can
get none so good at Home as he can buy
Abroad, and the <HI>Englishman</HI> can get none
so good Abroad, as he can buy at Home.</P>
<P>IT is the like with the Linen and Lace in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> if an <HI>English</HI> Gen∣tleman
travels into <HI>Flanders</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> he
carries as little Linen as possible out with
him, but gets all he wants made there; and
when he comes back, he is sure to make
himself two or three Dozen of fine Shirts,
and to lace them at the Neck and Hands
with fine Bone Lace.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, if a <HI>Dutch-man,</HI> or
<HI>French Gentleman</HI> comes over to <HI>England,</HI>
he is always well furnish'd with Linen and
Lace before he comes.</P>
<P>THE Reasons are just the reverse of what
is said above; the <HI>Dutch-man</HI> or <HI>Fleming</HI>
can get none so cheap Abroad as he can buy
<PB N="177" REF="209"/>
at Home, and the <HI>English-man</HI> can get none
so cheap at Home, as he can buy Abroad.</P>
<P>I give this Instance of the <HI>French,</HI> because
they are the People who are said to have
made the most considerable Advances in
the Woollen Manufacture; and much has
been said, and much fruitless Pains taken to
insinuate, that the <HI>French</HI> make our Goods
to Perfection; nay, some will tell you, the
<HI>French</HI> out-do us, and undersell us at Mar∣ket;
which is a great Mistake, and even in
the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade, which is the Top of their
Performance, and the Goods they send thi∣ther
are certainly the best of their Perfor∣mance;
yet I appeal to the Men of Expe∣rience
even in that Trade, whether they out∣do
us; whether, as is mention'd in our first
Chapter, a Bale of <HI>their Cloth</HI> will weigh as
much, or sell for as much at Market, as a
Bale of <HI>English</HI> Cloth? and whether in ge∣neral,
the <HI>English</HI> Cloth is not rather bought,
tho' at a dearer Price, by the <HI>Turkish</HI> and
<HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants, I mean those who
are the chief Dealers in those Goods, than a
Bale of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is true,</HI> there are in all Markets a sort
of Buyers, who take up with the Goods of
an inferior Quality, for the Sake of a cheap
Price, and these will buy the <HI>French</HI> Cloths:
And the worst Goods will find a Chapman, as
well as the best, if the Price be accor∣dingly.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="210"/>
IT is true also, the <HI>French</HI> Cloths carry
as good a Face as the <HI>English,</HI> are as well
drest, as well pack'd and set off, and the
Colours are as fine; so that it is not hard to
deceive the unexperienc'd Buyer: And this
is not the only Example of the superficial
Performances of that Nation, who are very
rarely wanting in Outsides, whatever they
are within; but the Substance is wanting,
the real intrinsick Worth of the Goods is
found in the <HI>English</HI> Cloths, and in them only;
there is all the Beauty of Colour, and the
Ornament of Dress, and the Substance too;
and this, whether the first Buyer can disco∣ver
it or no, the last Buyer and Consumer,
the <HI>Turkish</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Gentleman, <HI>Aga</HI> or
<HI>Bassa</HI> that wears it, finds it out presently;
one will wear firm and smooth, and solid to
the last; the other wears rough, light,
spungy, and into Rags; and when this Man
buys again, he calls for <HI>English</HI> Cloth, he
will have no more <HI>French</HI> Cloth, for it did
him no Service, it did not wear well.</P>
<P>IF I did not speak this from the Experi∣ence
and personal Knowledge of those that
have been upon the Spot, and been Wit∣nesses
to the very Fact, I should not take
upon me to affirm it thus positively; but I
may appeal for the Truth of it to unanswe∣rable
Evidence, nor is there Room to dispute
it; the Nature of the Thing speaks it, the
<HI>French</HI> Cloth, with all its superficial <HI>French</HI>
Gloss upon it, is fine, but thin and spungy,
<PB N="179" REF="211"/>
and will do the Wearer neither Credit or
Service, while the <HI>English</HI> Cloth wears to
the last like a Board, firm and strong, and
has a kind of Beauty even in its Rags.</P>
<P>HENCE I infer, we have no such Reason
to terrify our selves with the Apprehensions
of other Nations ruining our Trade, and
out-doing us in our woollen Manufacture;
let us but keep our Wool at Home, and
we need be in no Pain for our Manufacture
any where: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I return to the Magnitude of our Wool∣len
Manufacture; which, as I have said
above, I insist is the greatest single Manu∣facture,
and occasions the greatest Trade
both Abroad and at Home, of any Manufa∣cture
that is to be found in any particular
Nation in the World, be that Nation other∣wise
as much greater, richer, or more po∣pulous
than we are, as you will.</P>
<P>BUT there is yet another thing to be con∣sidered
in the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufacture,
which is above all our Boasts; and were we
to use the utmost Partiality, and the utmost
Art to compliment our own Country, and
set out the Beauty and Usefulness of our
Manufacture, nothing could be equal to this.</P>
<P>IT is not only great from the prodigious
Quantity of the Wool, the Numbers or the
People employ'd in it, the vast Quantity
of Goods made, and the Beauty and Perfe∣ction
of the Performance: But the Exten∣siveness
of its Consumption, is another Pro∣digy
<PB N="180" REF="212"/>
in Trade; and I cannot pass it with∣out
some Notice: I'll be as brief as I can.</P>
<P>LINEN is a Thing universally worn and
wanted; and few People of any tolerable
Figure or Fashion in the World are, or can
be without it: But then, more or less, all
the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> make it; and all they
have to do, is only as it were to exchange
Sorts with one another.</P>
<P>THE Silk Manufacture is very great, and
in all Nations some or other of it is made
use of, but then, 'tis made in many Coun∣tries,
and is exported from one to another
in Trade several Ways, the <HI>French,</HI> the
<HI>Italians,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> and now the <HI>English,</HI> make all
their own, and carefully exclude the <HI>East
Indian</HI> Silks from their Countries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Russian</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire are sup∣ply'd
from <HI>Persia,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and
<HI>Africans</HI> South, and the <HI>Germans</HI> and
<HI>Swedes</HI> North, from <HI>India,</HI> the Variety
spreads as the Situation of the Countries,
and as the Commerce directs.</P>
<P>The Callicoes are sent from the <HI>Indies</HI>
by Land into <HI>Turky,</HI> by Land and Inland
Seas into <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> and about
by long-Sea into <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> till
in general they are become a Grievance,
and almost all the <HI>European Nations</HI> but
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> restrain and prohibit them.</P>
<P>BUT take our <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manu∣facture,
and go where you will you find it;
<PB N="181" REF="213"/>
'tis in every Country, in every Market, in e∣very
trading Place; and 'tis receiv'd, valued,
and made use of, nay, call'd for and wanted e∣very
where. In a Word, all the World wears
it, all the World desires it, and all the World al∣most
envies us the Glory and Advantage of it.</P>
<P>NOR is it the Dress of the Mean and the
Poor in the several Countries where it
spreads, but of the Best and Richest: The
Princes, nay, at this Time I may say, the
Kings of the Earth, are cloth'd with it. I
appeal to all his Majesty's Servants, who
have had the Honour of his Commission as
Ambassadors, and Residents in foreign Coun∣tries,
and the Courts of Princes throughout
<HI>Europe,</HI> whether they have not seen the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Sweden,
Denmark, Prussia, Poland;</HI> nay, even the
Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> himself, cloathed in
<HI>English</HI> Cloth.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Spain</HI> vouchsafes, even on
his Days of Ceremony, to appear in a Bays
Cloak; the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> Lord of the
whole <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, has His Robe of <HI>En∣glish
Cloth,</HI> and the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> amidst
all his <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Silks, wears his
long Gown of Crimson <HI>Broad Cloth,</HI> and
esteems it, as it really is, the noblest Dress
in the World.</P>
<P>As it is with the Princes, it is, and ever
will be with the People, the Nobility, the
Gentlemen, and in a Word, the Burghers,
the best and wealthiest of the People are
<PB N="182" REF="214"/>
generally cloath'd with it; nay, so far
has it prevail'd, that in <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and other cold Climates, it has been known,
that those who could not go to the Price of
<HI>English Cloth,</HI> have bought the Lifts of it
which the Taylors cut off, sowed them
together, and lin'd them with Furs, to make
them long Robes or Garments, which they
wore in that Country, till the late <HI>Czar</HI> cut
them shorter for them.</P>
<P>AND this brings me back to the Imitati∣ons
which the People of these several Coun∣tries
are said to run into, to the Prejudice of
our Manufacture. 'Tis true, the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
the <HI>Prussians,</HI> and several other People, do
imitate the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture, and would
gladly do it: universally for the Advantage
of their People; and we cannot blame them;
nay, even this alone is a Document, an authen∣tick
Voucher to the Truth of what I have
said: For if our Woollen Manufacture were
not necessary to them, they would not buy
it of us; and if not profitable, they would
not attempt to mimick and make it.</P>
<P>BUT what does it all amount to? they are
able indeed to make the coarsest and meanest
of the Manufacture, and that just enough
to cover and cloath the Boors, and most de∣spicable
of their People; those whose Clo∣thing
was our coarse Duffells, Wadmill, Half
thicks, and in general a kind of the coarsest
Kersies, but a Degree or two above Blan∣kets;
or perhaps, the meanest of our Dozens,
<PB N="183" REF="215"/>
and what we call <HI>Yorshire</HI> Cloths: And even
this is done but indifferently neither.</P>
<P>BUT in all these Countries, the People
of English still cloath with our <HI>Fashion</HI> fine
broad Cloth; and 'tis ordinary to have a
Ship bound to <HI>Gottenburgh,</HI> or to <HI>Stock∣holm,</HI>
carry 500 or 1000 <HI>Spanish Cloths</HI> at
a Time into <HI>Sweden;</HI> by <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths I
mean the fine medly Cloths, such exactly
as we wear here, which are mix'd with
<HI>Spanish</HI> Wool in the Making, and there∣fore
call'd <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths.</P>
<P>IT is the same at <HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Konings∣burgh,
Straelsund</HI> or <HI>Dantzick,</HI> notwith∣standing
the Kings of <HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI>
prohibiting our Cloths, and setting their
own People to Work.</P>
<P>TO conclude; our Manufacture is the
general Wear, for therein the Argument is
forcible; 'tis not that some of it is to be had
everywhere, for so might be said of several
other Things, as of the <HI>French</HI> fine Stuffs,
Silks and Druggets, and other light spungy
Manufacture of Hair and Silk mingled with
Wool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>English</HI> broad Cloth is the ge∣neral
Wear; the Druggets, Serges, Du-roys,
Kersies, Camlets; in a Word, the Wool∣len
Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are the
general Wear in all the Countries in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovites,</HI> as I have said, wore
them formerly in their long Vests, the
<HI>Germans,</HI> the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Swedes</HI> are clothed
<PB N="184" REF="216"/>
with them universally; witness the great
Marts or Fairs, of <HI>Leipsick</HI> and <HI>Frankfort,</HI>
where such exceeding Quantities of them
are sold every Year, as is said above, and wit∣ness
the Cities of <HI>Hamburgh, Lubeck, Bre∣men</HI>
and <HI>Embden,</HI> by which all the Provin∣ces
of the lower <HI>Germany</HI> are supplied.</P>
<P>NOT a capital City in the Empire, but
you may find the Shops of the Tradesmen
stor'd with <HI>English</HI> Cloth, as far as the Na∣vigation
of the <HI>Elb,</HI> the <HI>Oder,</HI> or the <HI>Weis∣sel</HI>
can convey them; the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Maes,</HI>
the <HI>Moselle,</HI> the <HI>Saar,</HI> the <HI>Main,</HI> the
<HI>Neckar,</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> they all assist to hand
it on, not at <HI>Prague</HI> only, not at <HI>Vienna,</HI>
not at <HI>Munich,</HI> but even at <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI>
it is to be sold; and the best Gentle∣men
in the Country buy it, if they do not,
'tis for Want of Money, and not for Want
of Will.</P>
<P>FROM the Empire, and the northern
Countries, come away into the <HI>Mediterra∣nean,</HI>
I have mention'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Court,
there you see the <HI>Bassas,</HI> the <HI>Agas,</HI> the
<HI>Kadileschars,</HI> and even the <HI>Grand Seigni∣or;</HI>
cloth'd with <HI>English</HI> Cloth, even in
their Habits of Ceremony.</P>
<P>FROM thence you come to <HI>Italy,</HI> 'tis the
same there, and the great Fair at <HI>Messina</HI> is
an undeniable Evidence of it, where there is
seldom so little as an Hundred Thousand
Pound Value, sold in our <HI>English</HI> Woollen
Manufacture every Season, such as Drug∣gets,
<PB N="185" REF="217"/>
Du-Roys, Sagathyes, Camlets, with
all other Sorts of Mens Stuffs, and broad
Cloth it self; and tho' they have wrought
Silks in such Abundance, and so cheap, yet
you see the <HI>Italians</HI> generally clothed in
<HI>English</HI> Cloth or thin Stuffs; the Clergy in
black Bays, the Nuns are vail'd with fine
Says, and <HI>Long Ells,</HI> and even the noble
<HI>Venetians</HI> wear our fine Cloth for their
best Dress.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Rome</HI> it is the same, the foreign Prin∣ces
and Ambassadors, and the <HI>Italian</HI> Prin∣ces
themselves, wear it at <HI>Millan,</HI> at
<HI>Turin,</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> even at <HI>Rome,</HI> 'tis all the
same: As to <HI>France,</HI> I mention'd it already,
and I scarce need name the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and
the <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT one Manufacture like this can
boast of so general a Reception, or of
being the Favourite Dress of the whole
Christian World? If we should go over to
<HI>America,</HI> whether to the <HI>Brasils,</HI> the flou∣rishing
Colony of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> how
many Hundred Thousand Moyd'ors a Year
do we receive from thence, for the <HI>English</HI>
Manufactures worn and consumed there,
notwithstanding the intense Heat of the
Place? 'tis the same Thing at <HI>Mexico,</HI> the
most luxurious, extravagant, and profuse
City and Country in the World; even there
the utmost Pride of the proudest People
upon Earth, is to be clothed in the <HI>English</HI>
Cloth, and to have their Wastcoats and
<PB N="186" REF="218"/>
Breeches of fine Camlets, and other Stuffs
of Crimson and Scarlet; and over all, a
Cloak of our <HI>Essex Bays.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS the same at <HI>Cartagena,</HI> at <HI>Pana∣ma,</HI>
at <HI>Lima</HI> and St. <HI>Jago,</HI> the Capital
richest Cities of their several Countries;
some of them situate within ten Degrees of
the Equinox, and where the Heats are
almost unsufferable; which I mention to ob∣serve
to you, how well our Manufactures
are adapted to all Countries, Climates, Per∣sons,
and Qualities; not too thin for the
frozen <HI>Laplanders, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Russians,</HI>
or too thick for the scorch'd <HI>Americans</HI>
and Inhabitants of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Brazil;</HI> not
too light for the <HI>Germans,</HI> or too <HI>hea∣vy</HI>
for the <HI>Italians.</HI></P>
<P>IN Value 'tis the same; not too cheap
for the Nobility, no not for the Kings and
the Emperors of the World; not too dear
for the Burghers and the Tradesmen, no
not for the Boors, and the Peasants; not too
gay for the Men, not too grave for the
Ladies: We find in common, the <HI>British</HI>
Manufacture is the general Wear, as well
of Poor as rich; the highest Sovereign, and
the most retir'd Recluse; 'tis the best Habit
of the best of their People, in every Nation
in <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> the
only Country where it is not so, is that Part
of <HI>Asia,</HI> which we call the <HI>East Indies,</HI> where
the infinite Variety of their own Manu∣factures,
and the little Time that the
<PB N="187" REF="219"/>
<HI>English</HI> have traded among them, has not
yet made its Way; yet we find it begins to
be received in <HI>China,</HI> and also at the Court
of the <HI>Mogul;</HI> and as the Number of <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI>
encrease in the <HI>Indies,</HI> there is
Room to believe the <HI>British</HI> Manufactures
will gain Ground among them too; It is evi∣dent,
that at <HI>Melinda,</HI> and the other <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
Settlements on the East Coast of <HI>A∣frica,</HI>
beyond the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI>
where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have brought the
Natives to wear Clothes, even within five
Degrees of the Line; there the <HI>British</HI> Ma∣nufacture,
carried by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to
them, are the general Habit, as well of the
Natives, as of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> among whom
they dwell.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more plain than these
Facts, of which the whole World are Wit∣nesses?
And what can be a clearer Proof of
the Magnitude of our Woollen Manu∣facture?
I think I need say no more a∣bout
it.</P>
<P>WHAT Wonder then, that the several
Nations endeavour to set their own People
to work to make it? How could any other
be expected? That also is a farther Testimo∣ny
of its intrinsick Value, and the Necessi∣ty
of it in Use.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> IT appears, that they cannot be
without it.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> THAT it is to be had no where
else.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="220"/>
1. THEY cannot be without it; if any
other Sort of Goods would supply, if their
Linens would cloath the <HI>Germans,</HI> or their
Silks the <HI>Italians;</HI> if any Thing of their
own Growth would be equivalent to them,
why do they not prohibit ours, as they do the
Silks and Callicoes of <HI>India?</HI> I mean in
general, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> most ridiculous∣ly
did a few Months since, without having
any thing for their People to wear in the
Room of them; which made their very Wo∣men
laugh at them, and ask their Husbands
where they would get Cloths.</P>
<P>IT is true some Princes have prohibited
some of our Manufactures; that is to say,
such particular Sorts as their own Wool,
and their own People can make; but where
is the Prince or People, Kingdom or Em∣pire
in the World, the <HI>Indies</HI> excepted,
who will, or indeed can be wholly without
our Woollen Manufacture?</P>
<P>2. THAT it is not to be supplied from
any other Country, is as evident as the
other; for where is that Country, and why
are they not as rich, as opulent, as power∣ful
at Sea, and on Shore, as <HI>England</HI> is?</P>
<P>WHERE is the Country? if there is not a
Country, as I have prov'd above, that has
or can have an equivalent Manufacture, or
that does not buy from us, How should
there be a Country that can supply its
Neighbours?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="221"/>
BUT why do not some of the Nations,
who envy the Profits and Advantages of
this Manufacture to us, and who would
be careful to keep at home the immense
Sums of Money, which this (to us happy)
Article draws from them; I say, Why do
they not publish a general Prohibition, not
of this or that particular Sort of our Goods,
but of all Woollen Goods whatsoever, and
from what Country soever?</P>
<P>IS it possible, that they can find out
no Equipment for themselves? Might not
the Men in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> cloath them∣selves
in thick Silks, Velvets, and strong
<HI>Paduasoys?</HI> and in the North, might not
the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Russians,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the
<HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Prussians,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> dress
themselves in rich Furrs, Skins of Beasts,
such as the Sables and Ermines, Beaver, Ot∣ter,
and black Fox Skins, the latter more
valuable than Ermines?</P>
<P>METHINKS the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI>
who are such Masters of the Linen and Silk
Manufactures, and have the Advantage of
such Quantities of Furrs as the <HI>Russians</HI> could
furnish them with, might improve them into
some Form, and turn them into some Shape,
so as to supply their Want of Clothes, and
not impoverish themselves and their Coun∣try
to buy Foreign Manufactures: The re∣verend
grave Sables, and the royal Ornaments
of Ermines, might serve to gratify their Va∣nity,
and make them all, like those Cor∣poration-Princes,
<PB N="190" REF="222"/>
called Aldermen; and
they might cloath as rich in Furs and Fox-Skins
as they pleas'd, if the Outside was
plain, the Inside would be great and rich,
and the Climate would reconcile them to
the Warmth of the Dress.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis impossible; it will not do; no∣thing
can answer all the Ends of Dress, but
good <HI>English</HI> broad Cloth, fine Camlets,
Druggets, Serges, and such like; these they
must have, and with these none but <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
can supply them; Be their Country
hot or cold, torrid or frigid, 'tis the same
Thing, near the Equinox, or near the Pole,
the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufacture clothes
them all; here it covers them warm, from
the freezing Breath of the Northern <HI>Bear;</HI>
and there it shades them, and keeps them
cool from the scorching Beams of a perpen∣dicular
Sun.</P>
<P>LET no Man wonder, that the Woollen
Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> is arriv'd to such a
Magnitude, when in a Word it may be
said to cloath the World; there are but
three Sorts of People in the World that do
not use it.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> THOSE that cloath altogether with
Callicoes, and Silks, as in <HI>India;</HI> the Ma∣nufactures
of their own Country.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> THOSE that living in some hot
Countries, wear no Cloths at all. And,</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> THOSE who are so very poor and
despicable, that they cannot get it.</P>

very great, and may be said to exceed the
Importations of <HI>England;</HI> and I believe in
many Articles they do so, if we consider
their <HI>East Country</HI> Fleets, their <HI>Greenland</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="224"/>
Fleets, their <HI>East India,</HI> their <HI>French</HI> Wine,
and their Herring Fleets, and all their other
Branches of Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> and to the <HI>Me∣diterranean;</HI>
and especially their Importati∣ons
of <HI>woollen Manufacture, Sugars, Tobac∣cos,</HI>
wrought and other Plantation Goods;
<HI>Lead, Tin, Iron,</HI> and <HI>Brass; Drugs, Dye
Stuffs, Corn,</HI> &amp;c. from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then the <HI>Dutch</HI> must be understood
to be as they really are, the <HI>Carryers of the
World,</HI> the middle Persons in Trade, the
Factors and Brokers of <HI>Europe:</HI> That,
as is said above, they <HI>buy</HI> to <HI>sell</HI> again,
<HI>take</HI> in to <HI>send</HI> out; and the greatest Part
of their vast Commerce consists in being
supply'd from all Parts of the World, that
they may supply all the World again:
Thus they supply some Nations with Corn,
others with Ships, or Naval Stores for
Ships; others with Arms and Ammunition
of all kinds; such as Powder, Shot, Shells,
Lead, Iron, Copper, Cannon, Mortars,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> others with Fish, others with woollen
Manufactures, <HI>and the like;</HI> and yet, they
have neither Corn, Hemp, Tar, Timber,
Lead, Iron, Arms, Ammunition, woollen
Manufacture, or Fish of their own Growth;
the Product of their own Land or Seas,
or Labour of their own People, other than
as Navigators and Seamen, to fetch, find,
and carry them.</P>
<P>NOR is their home Consumption of fo∣reign
Importations great, except of Corn
<PB N="193" REF="225"/>
woollen Manufacture; their People are
few, compar'd to foreign Nations, tho'
many compar'd to the Country where they
dwell; their Way of Living is sparing, their
Excesses few and mean, and their Ostenta∣tion
or Gayety very low priz'd.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England,</HI> the Country is large,
populous, rich, fruitful; the Way of Liv∣ing,
large, luxurious, vain and expensive,
even to a Profusion, the Temper of the
People gay, oftentatious, vicious, and full
of Excesses; even criminally so in some
Things, and too much encreasing in them
all.</P>
<P>HENCE comes as a Consequence, a vast
Importation of foreign Growth of every
kind, either for Eating or Drinking, for
Fancy or Fashions, and this so great, as
not to be equall'd in any Part of the World;
the Fact seems a Charge, tho' not design'd
as such, but to illustrate the Subject: But
I must descend a little to Particulars, to
make it out.</P>
<P>I am credibly inform'd, and firmly be∣lieve
it to be true, that take all the maritime
Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> where no Wine is
made, and cast them up together, they do
not import so much Wine as the Subjects
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> do, for we have not a
Drop of our own Growth; and this, not∣withstanding
a very great Consumption of
Malt-Liquors, Malt and Melasses Spirits,
Brew'd and distill'd at Home; and notwith∣standing
<PB N="194" REF="226"/>
a vast Quantity of Cyder and Per∣ry,
Mead, Rum, and other Liquors; much
of it spent in meer Extravagance and Profu∣sion;
and in spite of a most excessive Duty
upon the Importation of the Wine, as well
as an Excise upon the Consumption of the
brew'd Liquors of our own.</P>
<P>THE Importation of Wines of all Kinds,
and Brandy included, from abroad, have
been often calculated by just Mediums of
Years, and is lately cast up for the Year
1721, at 60000 Pipes, or 30000 Ton <HI>per
Annum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then let me add by Way of Sup∣plement,
That as I understand it,</P>
<P>1. ALL this Account is exclusive of the
Wines and Brandy imported in <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and the <HI>Isle of Man;</HI> and of all
the <HI>Madera</HI> and <HI>Canary</HI> Wines imported in
our Colonies, the <HI>Madera</HI> Wine being at
least 1000 Ton <HI>per Annum;</HI> and the Wine
imported in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. can∣not
be so little as 3000 Ton more, which
makes it 40000 Ton in all.</P>
<P>2. IT is exclusive of all the <HI>French</HI>
Wines and Brandy run on Shore by the
Smugglers, in all the three Kingdoms,
and especially in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI>
where I have some particular Reasons to
believe, not 1-6th Part (of the Brandy, es∣pecially)
pays the Duty.</P>
<P>3. IT is exclusive of all the Rum distil∣led
in the <HI>West India</HI> Colonies, and con∣sum'd
<PB N="195" REF="227"/>
in those Colonies, as well in the
lands, as on the Continent.</P>
<P>THESE are all to be call'd Importations,
and the Sum total is prodigious; let any
Man that may think me severe, in saying
we are a luxurious, expensive People, cal∣culate
the annual Consumption of Wine
and strong Liquors in his Majesty's Domi∣nions
at this Time; and then judge imparti∣ally,
whether I do Justice to the People
or no.</P>
<P>WERE Wine the ordinary Drink of the
People, or were strong Beer and Ale the
needful Table-Liquors for the Support of
Life, it were quite another Case; but if
Wine were the ordinary Drink, it would
be mingled in the drinking with Water,
as it is in the usual drinking of the Coun∣tries
where it grows, as in <HI>Spain, Italy,
France,</HI> &amp;c. where scarce any Wine is
drank without Water, and very little to
Excess.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> IN <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Wine
mingled with Water, is the ordinary
Beverage or Drink for meer Necessity,
as Food; but if they take any Thing
to exhilerate or raise the Spirits, it is
Brandy; which yet, they very rarely
drink to Excess; whereas here; all, as
well Brandy as Wine, and all our strong
compounded Drinks, such as stout Ale,
Punch, Double-Beer, Fine-Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are all drank to Excess, and that to
<PB N="196" REF="228"/>
such a Degree, as to become the Poi∣son,
as well of our Health as of our
Morals; fatal to the Body, to Prin∣ciples,
and even to the Understanding;
and we see daily Examples of Men of
strong Bodies drinking themselves in∣to
the Grave; and which is still worse,
Men of strong Heads, and good Judg∣ment,
drinking themselves into Idio∣tism
and Stupidity: But that by the
way; I return to the Discourse, as it
is the Subject of Trade; Wine, and all
the strong Liquors mention'd above,
are not our Drink, but our Excess;
not our needful, but our superfluous
Drink.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, our <HI>Table Beer,</HI>
which is the wholesome, useful, and necessa∣ry
Liquor of the Country, made for Family-Supply,
and used as such by the sober Part
of our People, is excluded from the Ac∣count:
Nor is there a Gallon of Water
mingled with a Hogshead of Wine, one
with another, for all the Wine we drink.</P>
<P>I am not going to launch out here into
a Satyr upon our Country, or to dip into
the Scandal of our common Vices; the im∣mense
Greatness of our Trade is the Sub∣ject;
but our Vices are so unhappily min∣gled
with our Interest in Trade, that as a
late Author, writing on that Subject, says
well, <HI>Our Luxury is become a Virtue in
<PB N="197" REF="229"/>
Commerce,</HI> and our Extravagancies are the
Life and Soul of our Trade.</P>
<P>AS I proposed to judge of the Great∣ness
of our Manufactures, by the Quantity
of the Wool which is consum'd in ma∣king
them; so we may take some View of
the Consumption of Liquor among us,
from the Quantity of Malt consum'd in
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> that being the
Fund or Principle from whence they are
produc'd.</P>
<P>I shall not enter here into a Cloud of
Figures, to deduce the long Account; but
tell you in the Gross, and at one View,
that calculating the Quantity of Drink
brew'd from the Quantity of Malt made,
and taking that from the Foot of the Ex∣cise,
<HI>or Duty</HI> paid on the Malt, called in
general the <HI>Malt Tax,</HI> I venture to affirm,
there are forty Millions of Bushels of Malt
brew'd or distill'd in his Majesty's Domi∣nions
every Year, exclusive of what is ex∣ported
in Trade to foreign Countries.</P>
<P>IT remains only to deduct out of this
Reckoning, the <HI>small Beer;</HI> that is to say,
the Quantity yearly made Use of in Table
Beer for Family-Uses; and should I take
out one fourth Part for necessary Beer, as
I call it; that is, small Table-Beer, which,
I think, is a great deal too much, there
would still remain thirty Millions of Bu∣shels
to be brew'd in strong Beer, which
it must be acknowledged, is much of it Lux∣ury
<PB N="198" REF="230"/>
and Extravagance, much of it Vice
and Intemperance.</P>
<P>REDUCE this again into Drink, and al∣low
three Bushels of Malt to every Barrel
of strong Beer; this makes no less than
ten Millions of Barrels of strong Beer con∣sum'd
at Home, in this sober Nation in a
Year.</P>
<P>THE only Exception to this Account
that I can meet with, which has any
weight in it, is, that some of this Malt is
distill'd into Spirits; and suppose I allow
200000 Quarter <HI>per Annum,</HI> so consum'd,
that is, one Million, 600000 Bushel; it will
be answer'd, <HI>1st,</HI> That this is of the worst
of the Malt, and of a Kind which would
not make good Beer, if it was brew'd, and
that much of it is not fit to be brew'd at
all: But then, <HI>2d,</HI> It will be said, that
this cannot be plac'd to the Account of
our Temperance, or taken off from the
Luxury spoken of, since 'tis generally
brew'd into a worse Liquor, and apply'd
to worse uses, which it is not my Business
at this Time to talk of, and which it would
be better, were it entirely forgotten (if that
could be) then spoken of at all.</P>
<P>IF this Consumption of Liquors in the
King's Dominions were to be calculated
in the whole, and the Value were to be
cast up in Money, what an immense Sum
would it amount to? And what an Article
<PB N="199" REF="231"/>
would it make in the Magnitude of our
Trade?</P>
<P>1. TAKE the Wine and Brandy consum'd
in the whole, and suppose the Quantity
to be no more, than what is legally import∣ed,
not reckoning the so much greater
Quantity of what is clandestinely run on
Shore by Smuggling, and other Frauds:
If the legally imported Quantity of Wine
and Brandy amounts to 40000 Ton, the
Rum consum'd in the Plantations not in∣cluded,
which is a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>LET this be brought to the Pint Pot;
that is, to the Retailer, and reduce it thus,
1. The Price of almost all Sorts of Wine
and Brandy, is at least to a Consumer, sold
at two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quart; the <HI>French</HI>
Wine, the Canary, the Rhenish, the Sher∣ry,
all at more than two Shillings; and the
Brandy by retail, generally at double the
Price: But take it one with another, at
two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quart, which is eight
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Gallon, and make a reasona∣ble
Allowance for Bottoms and Leakage,
as usual; yet to what an immense Sum
does the Consumption of imported Liquors
in the <HI>British</HI> Dominions amount to?</P>
<P>252 Gallons is a Ton, this at <HI>8s. per Gallon,</HI>
(the Retailers Price) amounts to 100 <HI>l. 16 s.
per</HI> Ton; but abating 12 Gallons in every
Ton for Bottoms and Leakage: And suppose
it to be but 240 Gallons Nett Wine <HI>per</HI> Ton,
at 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Gallon, it is 96 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton.</P>

</LIST>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THERE is no need at all of the
Abatement for Bottoms and Leakage,
the Vintners making effectual Pro∣vision
for it in their short Measure;
and if that is not taken out, it a∣mounts
to just four Millions Sterling
<HI>per Annum;</HI> besides all the Wine and
Brandy really imported in the dark;
<HI>that is,</HI> by clandestine Trade, Smug∣gling,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much is calculated upon the legal
Importation; and as we may call it, the
known, and avow'd Consumption of Wines
and Brandy in the Dominions of <HI>Great
Britain;</HI> what we may suppose to be clan∣destinely
brought on Shore, is hard to
determine: But they who know as I do,
how common, how plentiful Brandy is, I
mean <HI>French</HI> Brandy, known and acknow∣ledg'd
to be such on all the Sea Coasts of
<HI>England,</HI> in all Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
and how much it is us'd. They who'd
know, that but a few Years ago, 5000 Ton
<PB N="201" REF="233"/>
of Brandy was said to be brought into the
Isles of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey,</HI> from <HI>France</HI> in
one Year. They who have had any Know∣ledge
of the prodigious Quantity of Wine
and Brandy constantly brought to, and ma∣nag'd
(so it seems 'tis call'd) in the <HI>Isle of
Man,</HI> for some Years past, and by which
that whole Island is visibly enrich'd, to a
surprising Degree: I say, those who have
had any Insight in these Things, will not
think it unreasonable to allow, at least one
fourth Part more of Wine and Brandy to
this Account.</P>
<P>BUT it is enough to mention it only; I
believe, it will be readily admitted, that
what is said above, is very likely to be true,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>British</HI> Dominions import
more Wine, than all the Countries of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
who are without Wine of their own
Import, put them all together.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that some of those
Countries import more Brandy than we
do, in Proportion to their Trade; but it is
to be allow'd, only, because we have load∣ed
the foreign Brandy with heavy Duties,
in order to encourage the Consumption of
our own Malt Spirits.</P>
<P>2. I might in the next Place calculate
here the Value, as I have already the Quan∣tity
of our home Consumption of strong
Beer and Ale, among our own People;
and it would not be difficult to do it, ei∣ther
from the Quantity of Malt consum'd
<PB N="202" REF="234"/>
in the whole, (as well for Sale, as for pri∣vate
Use) as also from the Rate of Excise:
But the Sum would be so great, it would
surprise the Reader.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Beer, or Ale brew'd in
Gentlemens Houses for private Use, does
not cost so much as the Beer brew'd for
Sale, because of the Excise; but then, if we
should abate reckoning the Beer and Ale
retail'd, at the Price paid by the Consumer,
which is the manner of Reckoning we are
now going upon, and is the true way, when
we are to examine the Magnitude of an
Expence, on the Foot of Trade; <HI>I say then,</HI>
if we should abate the retailing Price of the
Beer and Ale retail'd, in Ballance of the
Quantity consum'd in private Families,
which I think is giving up a very manifest
Odds; upon this Equality, we might bring
it to a Head, by rating all the strong
Beer, and Ale consume'd in <HI>England,</HI> at the
Rate of twenty Shillings, upon every three
Bushels of Malt. If there are any Ob∣jections
to be made against the Calculation,
I believe they would be easily answer'd;
but if they cannot, they may be ballanc'd
by Abatement; for as by this Calculation,
the Consumption of strong Drink amounts
to no less than ten Millions Sterling <HI>per
Annum,</HI> if we should abate a quarter Part
of it; 'tis an immense and almost incredi∣ble
Sum, and what no other Nation in the
World can expend in one single Article.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="235"/>
Now to examine this a little another
Way, let any Man that is admitted to such
a Liberty, cast up the Books of the Excise,
and tell us how much the Excise upon
strong Beer amounts to in <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from thence some Estimate
may be made.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then, for Example, the Duty,
as collected; for in this Account, we are not
to cast up and deduct the Charges of the
Collection, the Establishment of the Of∣fice,
the Incidents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but how much is
collected from the Brewer; I say, suppose
this amounts in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and all his Majesty's Dominions,
where the Excise is payable, to 800000 <HI>l.
per Annum:</HI> I doubt not, but it amounts
to much more; but let the critical Enqui∣rer
do Justice on that Account, as he finds
the Case will demand; I have good Grounds
to say it may be cast up thus, till a Rea∣son
is produc'd why it should not.</P>
<P>IF the Excise then, at four Shillings and
nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel upon strong Beer,
collects 800000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> the Beer
being sold to the Retailer, at twenty Shil∣lings
<HI>per</HI> Barrel, must then amount to a∣bove
four Times the Sum: We need not
in such a conjectural Estimate as this, cast
up the Fractions of three Pence <HI>per</HI> Bar∣rel,
it would but add to the Sum, which
you may evidently see, I do not seek to
make greater than it is.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="236"/>
THIS then brings the Value of the
Beer, as sold to the Retailer, to be three
Millions two hundred thousand Pounds <HI>per
Annum.</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this then, the Value of the strong
Beer brew'd for private Families, which,
as before, I take to be equal to the other,
(under the Disadvantage of its being under
rated, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Retailer, and not to the
Consumer) but to avoid Cavils, I'll state
it at half that Sum: The Expence then of
strong Beer in these Dominions, rises to
four Millions nine hundred thousand Pounds
<HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>I could support these Estimates, by a
stricter comparing the Quantity brew'd,
with the Quantity of Malt made; but 'tis
needless here, there is a manifest Difference
between exact critical Examination, and a
general Estimate, after the manner of an
Hypothesis; it is the latter that is before me
now; wherein, however, the Advantage is
so great, that it fully answers the End of
the Argument, if I should throw in a Mil∣lion
or two of Pounds Sterling, in the
whole, and take it at so much less than it
really amounts to, as I am well <HI>assur'd
I do in this Account: For Example,</HI> if ac∣cording
to the proposed Principle, I am
casting up the Value of the strong Liquors
which the Nation consumes, and ought to
take it (for the purpose) at the Rate it costs
the Consumer, as I did in the Wine, it
<PB N="205" REF="237"/>
would stand thus. Every Barrel of strong
Beer retailed by the Victuallers, measures
him out by the Quart Pot 36 Gallons; this
sold at <HI>3d. per</HI> Quart, the ordinary Price,
(tho' the general Rate is now 4 <HI>d.</HI>) is 36 <HI>s.</HI>
the Barrel, bestides the Advantage of the sel∣ling
much of it at 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pint, and besides
the Half, which the Victualler finds in short
Measure.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THIS is evident in the Suttlers
and others, who draw Drink in Garri∣sons;
and the Tapsters, who take Cel∣lars
and Tap-houses in great Inns, who
frequently allow the Governours and
Masters of such Houses, 30 to 35 <HI>s.</HI> and
some 40 <HI>s. per</HI> Barrel for the Drink they
draw under them; so that if I calcu∣late
all the strong Beer at the Rate of
but 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Barrel, it will allow for
all the Objections that can be made
against any other Part, seeing it cannot
amount to much above half the Value
which the Consumer pays.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, I take upon me to say,
without any Hazard of being confuted, that
there is consumed in his Majesty's Domini∣ons,
of all the following Liquors, exclusive
of small Beer, no less, reckoning it at the
Value paid by the Consumer to the Retailer,
and including the strong Beer brew'd for
private Use, than the full Value of eight
Millions <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>

<P>THE Plantations, as being Part of our
selves, are always in Accounts of Trade, to
be cast up with our other Accounts; and as
their Produce is esteem'd our own: So their
Consumption should be also, and is so in all
just Calculations; and for this Reason, the
Importations from thence are not reckon'd
as foreign Importations, but as a Home
Produce.</P>
<P>THE next Article of the Importation of
foreign Goods is Linen, and this, it must be
acknowledg'd, relates more especially to
<HI>England,</HI> and to the Consumption here, and
in the <HI>English</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>OF this Consumption, it may indeed be
said <HI>it is a Prodigy;</HI> and tho' there is a con∣siderable
Quantity of Linen made in some
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> especially in the North
<PB N="207" REF="239"/>
Parts, as in <HI>Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire,</HI>
and the four other Northern Countries, in∣somuch,
that at one Market in <HI>Lancashire</HI>
'tis said, there is the Value of 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Week
sold in Hukabacks only; yet this Quantity is
so little worth mention, that this sort of Li∣nen
is scarce seen at <HI>London;</HI> but <HI>England</HI>
does as it were ravage the whole spinning
World for Linen and Linen Yarn and Lace,
which is Linen also.</P>
<P>THE principal Importations of Linen are
indeed from our neighbouring Countries;
but such is the exceeding Consumption of
Linen here, that it seems as if all the World
were not able to supply us; and this not
only of the coarser Kinds of Linen from the
Northern Nations, but such is the Demand
of fine Linens, <HI>Hollands, Cambricks,</HI> and
the finest of other Country Linen, that it is
advanc'd to me for a certain Truth, by a
Person experienc'd in those Trades, that
<HI>England</HI> alone wears and consumes as much
fine Linen; nay, his Words are, <HI>More of
the finest Linen</HI> than all the Kingdom of
<HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Austrian Netherlands,</HI> and the
<HI>united Provinces</HI> put together, where the
fine Linen is chiefly made.</P>
<P>I need not enter critically into the Enqui-whether
this is literally true or no; but
when I come to look into our Custom-house
Entries, and see by the Books the exceeding
Quantity of Linen, as well fine as coarse,
<PB N="208" REF="240"/>
imported into <HI>England</HI> from all Parts, it is
really surprising. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>COARSE <HI>Russia Linen,</HI> properly so call'd,
from <HI>Petersburgh</HI> and <HI>Narva Revel,
Riga, &amp;c. Canvas</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> Linen from
<HI>Dantsick, Koningsberg, Stetin</HI> and <HI>Stra∣elsund,
&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Diapers, Damasks</HI> and
<HI>Lawns,</HI> from <HI>Siles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> and <HI>Lusa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia,</HI> and <HI>Saxo∣ny</HI>
by way of <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> also other <HI>Germany</HI>
Linens, including a multitude of Sorts of
middling Finess, such as are the Manufactures
of several Countries upon the <HI>Elbe,</HI> impor∣ted
likewise from <HI>Hamburgh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THE Quantity of <HI>German Linen</HI>
imported from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> is past <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> these, besides <HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Scots Linen,</HI>
the Quantity of which, especially since the
Encouragement given to their Importation,
by the printing of Linen, is so much, that
the Importation of <HI>Irish Linen,</HI> amounts to
at least 2000000 Yards in a Year, and is
still exceedingly encreasing; being so in
Demand, that if the Ships are but a little
Wind bound, there is frequently not a Yard
of <HI>Irish Linen</HI> to be had in the Town.</P>
<P>LET any one judge, whether we do no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as it were ravage the World for Linen, and
whether I have exceeded in saying, we im∣port
more Linen than any one Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a very great Quantity of
Linen of all Kinds is ship'd off again from
<PB N="210" REF="242"/>
hence. But it is answered, That it is chiefly,
if not wholly to our own Colonies in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
which, as I said above, is justly to be
esteemed our own Consumption, as being
all consumed by our own People.</P>
<P>IT is indeed impossible to make an Esti∣mate
of the Quantity of Linen imported
from all these places into <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland:</HI> For notwithstanding the Quanti∣ties
made either in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI>
there are yet great Quantities of fine Hol∣lands,
Cambricks, and other Sorts imported
in both those Countries. I say, there can
be no Estimate made of the Value. But
having thus describ'd the Trade in its seve∣ral
Branches, I leave it under this General,
namely, that there is more Linen as well in
Bulk as in Value imported from other Coun∣tries,
into the <HI>British</HI> Dominions, than any,
or than all the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> put to∣gether
import besides us.</P>
<P>I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n over all the Kingdoms and Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Europe</HI> by Name, and from their par∣ticular
Circumstances give Reasons to prove
this. It is certain, that thro' all the <HI>German</HI>
Empire, <HI>Italy, France, Flanders, Holland,</HI>
all those Kingdoms and Provinces, either
make their own Linen, some small Quanti∣ty
of particular Sorts excepted, or make
more than they use, and send it abroad.</P>
<P>IT is also certain, that those Countries
where the Linen they make is of an inferior
Quality, as in <HI>Poland, Russia, Prussia,
<PB N="211" REF="243"/>
Pomerania,</HI> &amp;c. Either they use a very
little Quantity of <HI>Linen,</HI> compar'd to what
is made Use of in <HI>England,</HI> or make Shift
with the meaner Quality and Kinds, which
their own Countries produce; and except
the Courts and Princes in those Countries,
they call for very little from abroad.</P>
<P>FOR Proof of this, we are able to give a
known Example of all the Northern Parts
of the Empire in Particular; where 'tis evi∣dent,
tho' they buy neither from <HI>Holland,
France,</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> they are in no Want;
but the Gentry, and even the Princes and
Nobility are supplied with fine Linen, at
least the finest that they use from their own
Manufacture; that is to say, from <HI>Silesia,</HI>
and the Provinces of <HI>Lusatia, Bohemia,
Moravia,</HI> and the Countries adjoining;
so that all that Part of the World may be
said to make Linen even more than suffici∣ent
to themselves.</P>
<P>NOR can we desire a better Evidence of
this, than is to be found in the two follow∣ing
Articles,</P>
<P>1. THAT as I said above, we import into
<HI>England</HI> a great deal of fine Linen from
those Countries, such as fine <HI>Lawns,</HI> equal
to ome of the Cambricks which are made
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> also fine Diapers and Damasks;
and it cannot be doubted, but those Provin∣ces
which supply those Sorts to us at such
a Distance, are able to supply themselves;
for I call all the <HI>German</HI> Provinces on that
<PB N="212" REF="244"/>
Side, <HI>themselves;</HI> being all the Dominions
of the same Sovereign, speaking the same
Language, and lying contiguous to one
another.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves, who make
those fine HOLLANDS which we import
here, and which we give such a Price for,
buy the finest of the Yarn, with which those
Hollands are made, from those very Pro∣vinces;
and it cannot be question'd, but
that the <HI>Silesians,</HI> who supply the <HI>Dutch</HI>
with such fine Yarn, are able to supply them∣selves,
and the Provinces about them, with
all the finest Sorts of Linen they have Oc∣casion
to buy.</P>
<P>THIS Example is sufficient, and for this
Reason I bring it; to prove that all these
northern Countries supply themselves with
Linen sufficient for their own Uses; no Na∣tion
but <HI>Britain,</HI> nay, but <HI>England,</HI> buys
and imports the Gross of their Linen from
Abroad; and yet at the same Time, no
People in <HI>Europe</HI> wear and consume so
great a Quantity of Linen, and that Quan∣tity
so fine in its Quality, as the <HI>English</HI>
do.</P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> im∣port
great Quantities of Linen, having
very little of their own; but 'tis not worth
Mention, in Comparison with <HI>England;</HI>
nor do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wear any Proporti∣on
in <HI>Quantity</HI> to the <HI>English;</HI> as may be
determined from the Certainty and Same∣ness
<PB N="213" REF="245"/>
of their Dress: So I need say no more
to that Part.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Italy</HI> in all its Parts, from <HI>Na∣ples</HI>
to <HI>Turin, Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> they
not only do not use so much in Proporti∣on
as the <HI>English;</HI> but what they do make,
they (especially the <HI>Venetians</HI>) make in
their own Countries.</P>
<P>INDEED it cannot be supposed, that the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> who for so many Ages were
famous for making the finest Lace, and
consequently must have a sufficient Quan∣tity
of the finest Thread, could want a Ma∣nufacture
of the finest Linen; and it is
known, that they do not want it, but on
the contrary, export it to the Islands in
the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> and other Parts among
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who have much Cotton, but
little or no Flax.</P>
<P>THUS I think I may have accounted for
all the Linen-wearing World; that every
where but in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they wear
less Linen, or make more than in <HI>England;</HI>
and in most of those Countries, make suffi∣cient
for their own Use: There might be
some Exceptions to this general Head, <HI>that
is to say,</HI> that in <HI>Sweden, Norway</HI> and
<HI>Denmark,</HI> they do not make any large
Quantity of <HI>Linen,</HI> and that the City of
<HI>Lubec</HI> carries on the Linen Trade to <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
as the City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> does to <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
but the Objection is not worth the
Answer; it is provided for before; I do
<PB N="214" REF="246"/>
not say no other Nation imports any Li∣nen,
or use any, but what they make of
their own; but I do say and insist on it,
that all those Nations put together, do not
import the Quantity that <HI>England</HI> and the
other <HI>British</HI> Dominions do import.</P>
<P>I have quitted this Article, without men∣tioning
also, that besides the Quantity of
Linen we consume, which as above, is be∣yond
all Calculation, we import from <HI>Hol∣land,
Hamburgh,</HI> and especially of late
from <HI>Russia,</HI> very great Quantities of Linen-Yarn,
for our own People to manufacture,
and weave into Linen at Home; much of
which Yarn is made use of in the Home∣made
Cloth, which as I have said, our Peo∣ple
make in the northern Parts of <HI>England;</HI>
and in the Linsey Woolsey Manufactures at
<HI>Kiderminster, Manchester,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOR is this Importation small and in∣considerable,
tho' in Comparison of the Li∣nen
it is so indeed; but all join together,
to let us see what a Prodigy of Trade, the
Consumption of Linen in this Nation re∣ally
is; the Account of which is, without
Doubt, many Millions yearly.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> WHEREAS I omit the <HI>Turks,</HI> and
and all the eastern and southern Nati∣ons
in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Account of the
Linen Trade Abroad; the Answer is,
That all those eastern Nations are sup∣plied
with Cotton and Callicoe, in∣stead
<PB N="215" REF="247"/>
of Linen, and very little Linen
is used among them.</P>
<P>THE next Capital Head of our Importa∣tion

not only very considerable, but in a Word
exceeding great in Trade.</P>
<P>PERHAPS I may be cavill'd at for the
Term FRUIT, the Product being so vari∣ous,
and in its Appearance trifling; but as
'tis just to bring all such smaller Articles
under one general Head, as they are a
Merchandize; and that they are all really

THEY that at first Sight look upon this
Article under the Head of Fruit, will per∣haps
think it a trifling Thing, and that
Oranges, Lemons, Raisins, Almonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are all Trifles.</P>
<P>BUT let them go thro' all the Articles,
and bring them into one Head of Importa∣tion,
and they will have three Things to
observe, which bring them to our present
purpose.</P>
<P>1. THAT they are really so far from be∣ing
small, and of little Importance, that on
the contrary, they are very considerable,
and that many Ways.</P>
<P>2. THAT no Nation in <HI>Europe</HI> imports
an equal Quantity of any of them, much
less of all of them together, as we do.</P>
<P>THEY are a wonderful Testimony of the
Greatness of the <HI>British</HI> Commerce, in
that those twelve Articles of petty Trade,
(as they may, and would be esteem'd any
where else) are by our Consumption of
Quantity made so considerable; that as I
am assur'd by those who have made Esti∣mates
of the Value, the Coffee, Tea, and
Chocolate only, are equal in Trade, to the
Spices of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>IT is worth Notice also, what Num∣bers
of stout Ships these particular Ar∣ticles,
tho' small in themselves, constantly
employ; for besides the Pipiners, as they
call the running Fregats, and which are a
little Fleet of small Ships, that in the Sea∣son
<PB N="219" REF="251"/>
fetch Oranges from <HI>Sevil,</HI> and Lemons
from <HI>Malaga;</HI> I say, besides these, the
Trade for Raisins and Currants only, does
not freight less than forty to fifty good
Ships every Year from the Coast of <HI>Spain</HI> and
<HI>Italy,</HI> including the Island of <HI>Zant.</HI></P>
<P>THE Oyl from <HI>Gallipoli</HI> fourteen or fif∣teen
more; and so in Proportion those
Things which do not come single; as the
<HI>Coffee</HI> and the <HI>Tea,</HI> and all the smaller Kinds
of Goods from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and other Ports,
tho' they are little separately, yet toge∣ther,
are very great Articles in the Freight
of Ships, and encourage and support the
Navigation in its most considerable Parts.</P>
<P>IT would be surprising, if the Consump∣tion
of those few Articles once thought so
trifling, and formerly so entirely unknown,
were cast up into Money, and their Value
brought together, what Sums they would
amount to: To cast up the Tea, Coffee,
and Pepper only, three Articles of the East
<HI>India</HI> Trade; how often do we see in the
Cargoes of the East <HI>India</HI> Ships 500000 <HI>l.</HI>
Weight of Tea in one Ship, six or seven
hundred thousand Pound Weight, when
two Ships come in together? We cannot
suppose this sold cheaper than from 10 to 16 <HI>s.
per</HI> Pound to the Retailer; 300 to 400 Tun
of Coffee comes frequently Home in one
Ship; Pepper indeed is of less Value, and
not much of it consum'd in <HI>England;</HI> but
the Quantity is great, and the Chocolate
<PB N="220" REF="252"/>
makes up the Value of the rest to be a mon∣strous
Sum, considering it all as a Super∣fluity.</P>
<P>THE Importation of Silk is an Article of
home Consumption, grown up now to a
prodigious Height, and is the more profi∣table
to this Nation, in that,</P>
<P>1. IT is all manufactur'd within our
selves; and as it is now grown up to such a
Magnitude as was never known before, em∣ploys
abundance of our Poor, who, by De∣cay
of other Branches of Commerce, began
to be threatn'd with want of Employment.</P>
<P>2. AND especially, as it now supplies the
Nation with those fine Silk Manufactures,
by the Industry of our own Poor, which it
has been publickly prov'd, cost us (as above)
Twelve hundred thousand Pounds a Year
to purchase them of the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Fle∣mings,</HI>

To make an Estimate of the Value, or
of the Consumption of all these Things,
would be in some Measure to enquire into
the Number of our Shipping, of Ships
built yearly, (and which is still more as to
the Consumption) Ships repairing and fit∣ting
out; an Article, when join'd together,
too great to make any Calculation upon.</P>
<P>I might mention here, how unaccountably
to blame we are in this Trade; that where∣as
a full Supply might be had of all those
things, <HI>I may say, Every one of them</HI> from
our own Colonies, the Product of the <HI>Bri∣tish
proper Dominions,</HI> the Labour of the
<HI>British</HI> People, and which is equal to it, all
brought by our own Ships, to the vast En∣crease
of the <HI>British</HI> Navigation, it should
miserably be neglected or omitted, and the
Goods be bought with our ready Money,
great Part of them brought Home in
foreign Bottoms, and the whole Trade ma∣naged
in a wrong Place; or, as we may say,
running in a wrong Channel, to the infi∣nite
Advantage of the <HI>Danes, Swedes,
Poles, Prussians</HI> and <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and to
the enriching the (otherwise) poorest and
most worthless, and I had almost said, the
most beggarly Nations in the World. But
I shall speak farther of this by it self.</P>
<P>I have not in all this Account mentioned
any thing of our Importations from <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="256"/>
except only that Particular of the Spice
Trade, and Linens, which I call their own.</P>
<P>BUT this is not, that our Importations
from thence are not exceeding great, only
that we do not import any thing material
or considerable from thence, that is of their
own Growth or Manufacture; but that by
importing from them, we only bring in the
Goods of almost all Countries in the World
thro' their Hands: So that, tho' we are said
to sell them the Value of two Millions <HI>per
Annum</HI> in our own Manufacture; yet 'tis
certain, we take off again a prodigious
Quantity of Goods of other Nations thro'
their Hands; so that 'tis hard to deter∣mine
which Way the Balance turns, ei∣ther
for us, or against us, and I make no
Difficulty in affirming, that it may be some∣times
one Way, sometimes another.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, suppose a dear Year of
Corn in <HI>England,</HI> so that the Exportation
comes to be prohibited. This putting a Stop
at once to so considerable a Branch of our
Exports to <HI>Holland,</HI> would go a great Way
in shortning our Credit, in the general Ac∣count
of Trade with the <HI>Dutch for that
Year,</HI> and consequently might give a turn
to the Balance; we at the same Time not
abating our Demand of foreign Goods from
them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, suppose for a further Example,
a Scarcity of Sugars and Tobacco in the <HI>Bri∣tish
Colonies</HI> for the same Year; for at the
<PB N="225" REF="257"/>
Time that a common Sterility, or failing of
the Crop of Corn should happen in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
the Crop of Sugars might (<HI>as it often
does</HI>) fail in <HI>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</HI> and the
other Islands and Colonies of <HI>America,</HI> and
the Crop of Tobacco also in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this, that in such a Year, it being
probable the distilling of Corn might be
forbidden in <HI>England,</HI> as no doubt it would
for such an Occasion; the Consequence of
which would be the allowing a greater Im∣portation
of Brandy from <HI>Holland,</HI> which
they would pour in upon us, infinitely to
their Advantage, we being pleased at this
Time to allow the bringing in <HI>Brandy</HI>
by way of <HI>Holland,</HI> at the same Time
loading it with an insupportable Duty,
if directly brought from other Places, tho'
we might perhaps put all the Gain which
the <HI>Dutch</HI> make now of it, into our own
Pockets.</P>
<P>IN these, and many other Cases, it is
easie to suppose, that the Ballance of Trade
may, and sometimes does turn against <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
by our general Commerce with the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>NOR can it be doubted, but that even at
this Time, tho' the Exportation of Corn,
and of Sugars, and Tobacco, has no In∣terruption;
yet the late Encrease of the Im∣portations
from <HI>Holland,</HI> such as fine Hol∣lands
and Linen of all Sorts, and admitting
Brandy from thence, as above, has infi∣nitely
<PB N="226" REF="258"/>
encreased the Debt of Trade on our
Side, and at least turn'd the Ballance very
much in favour of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sum of all these Explanations, and
more, which might be mentioned, may
be drawn up into these Heads.</P>
<P>1. THAT the Magnitude of the <HI>English</HI>
Exportations, as they consist only of our
own Growth and Manufacture (including
that of our Colonies as our own) is grea∣ter
than that of any other single Nation in
the World.</P>
<P>2. THAT the Consumption in <HI>England</HI>
of foreign Importations, and of the improv'd
Product of our own Country; that is to
say, our Woollen and other Manufactures, is
likewise infinitely greater than the Home
Consumption of any other Nation.</P>
<P>FROM both which Articles, as they have
been explain'd in the last two Chapters, I
think I have suffciently made out what I
said in my Title, of the Magnitude of the
<HI>English</HI> Commerce, and that it is a Prodigy
of its Kind, the like of which is not to be
seen any where in <HI>Europe,</HI> if it may be in
any Part of the World.</P>
<P>THERE are some other Heads of Trade
necessary to be spoken to, in order to make
this Work a compleat Plan of the <HI>British</HI>
Commerce.</P>
<P>1. WITH Relation to <HI>Home Trade,</HI> I
should make some Estimates of the natu∣ral
<PB N="227" REF="259"/>
Product of the Land and Sea in this
Island, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Corn,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Cattle,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Mines,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Minerals,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Timber,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Stone.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HERE I should describe the Manner of
breeding and managing our Cattle, the prodi∣gious
Consumption, especially of their Flesh,
and the Employment of them; that is, of
Oxen and Horses in Labour for the car∣rying
on of Trade.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> ALSO I might assert, and (fully
prove my Assertion by unanswerable
Reasons) that notwithstanding in gene∣ral,
it is the Advantage of Commerce,
to have all Things done as cheap as
possible; yet that <HI>as</HI> it is the grand Sup∣port
of Wealth and Trade in <HI>England,</HI>
to have our Product consum'd, and in
order to it, to have our People and
Cattle employ'd; So, it is not always
the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> to lessen the
Labour of the said People and Cattle,
by the Encrease of River-Navigation;
and some Examples which might con∣firm
this might be brought, which
amount to a Demonstration.</P>
<P>2. WITH Relation to the Shipping and
Navigation of <HI>England,</HI> the Number of
Ships built and employ'd in <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
and in that Article two other, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.)
the Number of Trades depending upon the
<PB N="228" REF="260"/>
building and repairing, fitting and furni∣shing
of those Ships,. (2.) The Number
of Mariners who are bred up and employ'd
in those Ships, to the great Encrease of Na∣vigation,
and furnishing a constant Supply
of able Seamen, the Strength and Glory of
the whole Nation.</P>
<P>IN both these Heads, I have still the same
General to maintain, and that without the
least Boast, (namely) that <HI>England</HI> out-does
the whole Trading World, and that there is
no Nation, except <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that can
carry on such a Trade; and this that I may
not be suppos'd to speak in the Gross, and
leave it unsupported, I shall explain in the
Particulars following.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> BEFORE I descend to these Particu∣lars
I am to note, That I think it is no
Boast to insist upon the Article of Ship∣ping
as an extraordinary Branch of our
Commerce, not only as it is exceeding
great, but as so great a Quantity of
the Materials are of our own Growth
and Produce, and almost all of our
own Manufacture, whereas the Ship∣ping
in <HI>Holland</HI> has hardly any Thing
belonging to it produced at Home,
no not the Provisions which victual
the Ships.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="261"/>
HERE follows a Repetition of the Particu∣lars
in the Trade, in which I insist it is al∣ready
proved that we exceed other Coun∣tries.
<HI>Take it as follows,</HI> viz. That there
is not any one Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT consumes the like Quantity of
Flesh Meat, and Malt Liquor.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT having no Wine of their own Pro∣duction,
consumes the like Quantity of
Wine imported from Abroad.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT having so little Linen of their
own Product consume the like Quantity
of Linen imported from Abroad, or that
wear so much Linen, especially of the
finest that is or can be made.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT have such a Prodigious Quan∣tity,
or so good a kind of Wool.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THAT export an equal Quantity of, or
Value in any one Manufacture of their
own, let it be of what kind it will, as
<HI>England</HI> does of her Woollen Manu∣facture</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. THAT build and employ in their own
Business a like Number of Ships, and
maintain a like Number of able Seamen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. THAT have a like Variety of Nature's
Productions, singular to themselves, or
so singular, as that they are not to be had
in Quantities for Commerce in any other
Country; such as</ITEM>
</LIST></P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Magnitude of our Trade,
as it relates to our other Exporta∣tions,
and particularly what we
call Re-exportation, or Exporting
by Certificate; including the Ex∣ports
of Goods first imported from
our own Colonies, and Factories
Abroad.</HEAD>
<P>_ THO' all I have said of the Great∣ness
of our woollen Manufacture
is prov'd, and how great soever the
Consumption of it is in the World,
I would not be understood to mean, that
this was the whole of our Commerce, ei∣ther
one Way or other: On the contrary,
this is but one Branch of it: It is true, it
<PB N="231" REF="263"/>
is the most considerable Branch; that I must
always grant, and is indeed the Wheel
within the Wheel of all the rest; That which
sets all the Wheels of Trade in Motion;
I mean of the <HI>British</HI> Trade; 'tis the Life
of all the rest.</P>
<P>BUT we have several Branches of Com∣merce,
very considerable besides this, and
that for Exportation too: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>THE Exportation of Corn, Salt, Fish,
and Flesh, I put these four Articles toge∣ther,
for Reasons which we shall see in the
Course of this Work; they are all very
great Heads of Trade and Employ in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> a great Number of our Ships,
more perhaps than will be thought proba∣ble
at first Sight.</P>
<P>THIS Article, indeed, includes <HI>Ireland,</HI>
of which I have yet said nothing; tho' as
we are one Government, the Trade of
the whole ought to come under one Head
of Commerce: However, I shall not med∣dle
with the Trade of <HI>Ireland</HI> here, any
farther than as it is blended with the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Commerce, and carried on together,
as in this Article it is, and is inseparable
from it.</P>
<P>CORN is chiefly exported from <HI>England</HI>
to <HI>Holland;</HI> tho' <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which may
truly be call'd a Corn Country, is always
ready to send it, wherever they can find a
Market; so that wherever the Harvest hap∣pens
to fail abroad, whether in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="264"/>
Spain, <HI>Portugal,</HI> or even in <HI>Italy</HI> it self,
we are always at Hand to supply them; it
being very rare that <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>
has a general Scarcity, so as to stop the
Exportation.</P>
<P>As it is certainly true, that whatever
Corn can be spared for Exportation out of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> above what is necessary for
subsisting our own People, is clear Gain to
the publick Wealth of the Nation: So this
Article of exporting Corn, is one of the
most advantageous Parts of our Commerce,
in Proportion to its Magnitude.</P>
<P>NOR is the Dearness of the Price of
Corn at Home, any real Detriment to the
Generality, or any Abatement of the pub∣lick
Stock, provided we admit none from
Abroad; for tho' it may be a Damage to
some particular Persons, and may pinch the
Poor, who yet, for ought I see, are always
alike poor, in Plenty, as in Scarcity; of
which hereafter; yet, I say, 'tis no loss to
the publick Stock, because it is all paid a∣mong
our selves; The general Body of
the People have but one publick Stock of
Wealth, whereof every individual is trust∣ed
with a Part; and what they pay to, or
get from one another, no way lessens or
encreases that Stock, only lessens and en∣creases
the particular Part, which this or
that particular Person was so entrusted
with; as if ten Men, having each a hun∣dred
Guineas in their Pockets, go together
<PB N="233" REF="265"/>
into a Room or House to play; 1st, take the
Room in which they play, to contain a
publick Stock of the whole thousand Gui∣neas;
suppose then, after some Time of
play, one or two of the ten win all the
Money, and break the rest: There are
eight Men left empty and poor, and two
Men grown full and rich; but the Money
is all in the Room still, the thousand Guineas
are not diminish'd at all, the Stock they
play'd with is neither lessen'd or encreas'd.</P>
<P>THIS is too plain to dwell upon: It
is the same Thing in the Rise and Fall of
the Rate of Corn consum'd at Home.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, if Corn bears a
great Price in <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or any
where Abroad, all that Advance of Price,
except only the Labour of the People in
carrying it, is clear Gain; and even all their
Labour too, except the Provisions which
they consum'd in the Voyage, is so much
added to the publick Stock.</P>
<P>I am a profess'd Opposer of all fortuitous
Calculations, making Estimates by guess
Work, of the Quantities and Value of any
Trade or Exportation, where, as I said
before, there is no given Number or Rule
to raise those Estimates upon; and as this is
one of the Cases, in which there is no Cer∣tainty
to calculate from, and especially ha∣ving
not the Custom-House Books to re∣fer
to, I therefore decline it.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="266"/>
AND yet, I would not have been without
some probable Grounds of Calculation from
the Custom-House Books, if I had not
found that there is no judging of the Ex∣portation
of one Year, from the Quantities
exported in another, for the Reasons fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>1. BECAUSE our Exportation of Corn
depends upon the Crop we have had the
Harvest before, and by Consequence on the
Price the Corn bears at Market, whether
dear or cheap, according to which the Mer∣chant
is limited from, or encourag'd to the
Exportation.</P>
<P>2. BECAUSE likewise, tho' the utmost
Encouragement was given at Home for the
Exportation, the Quantity exported will
depend also upon the Plenty or Scarcity of
Corn Abroad. It is true, that dear or
cheap, Corn always finds a Market in <HI>Hol∣land:</HI>
But then, 'tis as true, that if the
<HI>Dutch</HI> find a forc'd Exportation, they, like
all expert Merchants, will buy cheap, and
perhaps to loss, or not buy at all: So that in
short, it is no Market at all: To sell to
Loss, is not to be call'd Trade, but a
Stop or Check to Trade; for the Seller find∣ing
no Profit, is sure to come there no
more, till he is satisfied by his Intelligence
of a better Market.</P>
<P>THE Quantity exported therefore de∣pending
upon such precarious Circumstan∣ces,
it would be of no Importance to make
<PB N="235" REF="267"/>
Calculations upon Uncertainties, that is
to say, upon such evident Uncertainties;
There may be 500000 Quarters of Corn
exported in one Year, and not one Bushel
the next; as was the Case among our selves
but a few Years ago, when there was not
less than a Thousand Quarters of Wheat a
Day entred at the Custom-house in <HI>London</HI>
for a great while together, to be exported
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> besides an immense Quantity
shipt off on all the West Coast of <HI>England,</HI>
from <HI>Chester Water</HI> as far North as the
<HI>Clyde</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> A great Scarcity hap∣pening
that Year in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be laying a preposterous Foun∣dation
to calculate from hence what might
be yearly exported that Way, when per∣haps
for twenty Years before, <HI>Ireland,</HI>
which generally is more able to spare
Corn, than likely to want it, had not called
for a Quarter of Corn, and perhaps may
not again, for twenty Years to come.</P>
<P>IT may be the like in <HI>France,</HI> and of∣ten
is, that in one Year they shall take two
or three Hundred Thousand Quarters of
Corn from <HI>England,</HI> if they can get it;
and the next Year or two would give no∣thing
for it (speaking comparatively) if you
would carry it them.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I say there is no Cal∣culation
to be made of the Quantity of
Corn exported; only that in general it is
always very great, (<HI>except as before.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="268"/>
THE East and South Coast of <HI>Britain</HI> is
chiefly concerned in this Trade from the
<HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to the Mouth of
the <HI>Thames;</HI> more especially the Ports of
the <HI>Humber,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> from
<HI>Lyn</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and the Coast of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> also, from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> exclusive, to
<HI>Ipswich</HI> inclusive.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> THE Fish; there is something more
of Certainty in our Calculations of the
Exportation of Fish, than of most other
Goods; particularly of the Herring, Pil∣chards,
and white Fish, and to take this by
the Merchants Calculations, rather than by
that of the Custom-house, because the
former can give an Estimate where the
latter cannot, I mean Abroad. To begin
North,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> are said to cure sixty Thou∣sand
Barrels of Herrings for Exportation,
one Year with another, including the West
of <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as the East Side; I think
they that calculated the <HI>Scots</HI> Herring-fish∣ing
at sixty Thousand Last, which is ten
Times the Quantity, had no Guess with
them, but spoke by Way of Bluster, (tho'
in Print) it being more than the <HI>Dutch</HI>
take one Year with another; at least in
their first Part of the Fishery: Sixty thou∣sand
Barrels is a large Quantity.</P>
<P>THE next Part of the Herring-fishing on
the <HI>British</HI> Coast is at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> for the
red Herring Trade; the Towns of <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI>
<PB N="237" REF="269"/>
and <HI>Leostoff</HI> are supposed, if they
have a good Fair, as they call it; that is
a good fishing Season, to cure four Thou∣sand
Last of Herrings, that is, forty Thou∣sand
Barrels a Year, the greatest Part of
which is exported to <HI>Holland, France, Spain</HI>
and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>NEXT to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the Fishing for Her∣rings
for the <HI>London</HI> Market comes in, and
for present Consumption, and this is a con∣siderable
Article; but being all for Home
Business, it weighs nothing in the Scale of
our foreign Commerce: These Fiese are or∣dinarily
taken in the Mouth of the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>IN the West of <HI>England,</HI> on the Coasts
of <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and sometimes
of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the <HI>Pilchards</HI> are a particular
Fishery, singular to that Coast, and found no
where else in those Seas, or in this Part of
the World; it is computed, that the usual
Quantity of <HI>Pilchards</HI> cur'd in those Seas
in a Year, are from a Thousand to twelve
Hundred Last.</P>
<P>ADD to these the Herring-fishing in the
<HI>Bristol Channel,</HI> about <HI>Bidiford, Barn∣staple,</HI>
and those Parts, where in a good
Year they usually cure about the same
Quantity of <HI>Herrings,</HI> as the other Side
cures of <HI>Pilchards.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the Sum of the fishing sor Her∣ring
on the feveral Coasts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
the Merchants of <HI>Belfast,</HI> and of <HI>London-Derry
in Ireland,</HI> have, as we are told, a
<PB N="238" REF="270"/>
considerable Share also in this Herring∣fishing;
but I have not learn'd any Thing
of the Quantity they take.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the <HI>British</HI> Fishing (for
Herring and Pilchards only) amounts not
to less than fifteen Thousand Lasts, or a
Hundred and fifty Thousand Barrels, be∣sides
the Home Consumption of the Fish
uncur'd.</P>
<P>THE next Branch of our Fishery is the
white Fish, which may be divided into
four Parts,</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> THE <HI>English</HI> Fishing for Cod in the
North Seas, and which are therefore called
the <HI>North Sea Cod;</HI> the Fish taken here is
generally brought to <HI>London,</HI> and to the
Sea Ports on the Coast, and is used princi∣pally
in victualling of Ships, Coasters, and
others, for short Voyages; as also for home
Consumption: So that this I take no notice
of in Trade.</P>
<P>2. THE second is, The <HI>Scots</HI> white Fish,
as they call it, which is the same kind of
Fish, and are taken upon the Eastern Coast
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>Heymouth</HI> to <HI>Dunbar,</HI>
and into the Mouth of the Firth: But nei∣ther
is the Quantity great on <HI>this</HI> Side.</P>
<P>3. THE Third is, The Fishing for Cod on
the North West of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and among the
Westward Islands, which lie about the <HI>Lewze</HI>
and the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> where the <HI>Glasgow</HI> Mer∣chants,
as also the <HI>London-Dery</HI> Merchants
take them; and these are usually exported to
<PB N="239" REF="271"/>
<HI>Spain,</HI> but not in great Quantities, that
Fishery being not improv'd to the Extent,
as it might be, for want of sufficient Ad∣venturers.</P>
<P>4. THE Fishing for Cod in <HI>Newfound∣land,</HI></P>
<P>5. THE like Fishing on the Northern
Coast of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Fisheries cure a very great Quan∣tity
of Fish; and if we may credit their own
Accounts, there are not lest than 200000
Quintals of Fish cur'd by them every Year:
Most of which is sent to <HI>Bilbo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to
<HI>Oporto</HI> and <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to all
the Ports of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> in the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI>
but especially to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and
also to our other Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> be∣sides
what is sent to the <HI>Canaries, Maderas,</HI>
and <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>THERE are two remaining Fisheries be∣longing
to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I mean for Trade,
and these are,</P>
<P>1. THE Whale Fishing carried on, (1.)
for some Years on the Coast of <HI>Long Island,</HI>
and <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> and <HI>New York;</HI> and
now, within about three Years, by the South
Sea Company at <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE. Salmond Fishing for barrelling
up and exporting them: And this is done,</P>
<P>1. AT <HI>Aberdeen</HI> in the North of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P>2. AT <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> on the Bor∣der
of <HI>England</HI> towards <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="272"/>
3. AT <HI>Newfoundland</HI> (that is) within the
Rivers on the Island of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI>
where they take pretty great Quantities,
and the Trade encreases every Year: But
neither of these are yet very considerable.</P>
<P>THUS far the <HI>Fishing Trade</HI> in which the
<HI>Dutch</HI> are said to go beyond us as to the
Herrings and the Whales, but not to come
near us in that of the white Fish.</P>
<P>N. B. THE white Fish or Cod is a very
improving and encreasing Trade, and
employs at least 200 or 300 Sail of
Ships or Ketches, besides small fishing
Vessels, without Number,</P>
<P>AS for the Exporting of Flesh; it con∣sists
of two Parts, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Exporting of
Beef from <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well to our Colonies
in the West <HI>Indies,</HI> as to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Exporting barrelled Pork from
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> chiefly brought by the Dutch for
victualling their Ships to the East <HI>Indies,</HI>
and other long Voyages.</P>
<P>3. THE Exporting of Tallow, Butter,
and Hides from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Flanders,</HI> by
the Ports of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Ostend,</HI> these
are properly annexed to the Flesh, as being
Part of its Substance.</P>
<P>THESE, put together, amount to a very
great Sum, especially the <HI>Irish</HI> Beef, of
which we can make no Estimate here.</P>
<P>3. OUR next considerable Article for Ex∣portation,
is the Product of our Colonies;
that is to say, such of them as being first
<PB N="241" REF="273"/>
imported from the <HI>English</HI> Plantations in
<HI>America,</HI> or from the <HI>British</HI> Factories in
the East <HI>Indies</HI> in our own Ships, and hav∣ing
been already assistant to our Navigation;
but being more than our Home Consump∣tion
calls for, are exported again by Certifi∣cate.
The Goods thus imported, are, chiefly
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From the East <HI>Indies.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Pepper,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Painted Callicoes,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wrought Silks,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Coffee,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Tea,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Indigo, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. From <HI>America.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Hides,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Virginia Tobacco,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sugar, Ginger,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Molasses, Logwood,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cotton and Indigo,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rice, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>OF these the main Articles for Re-expor∣tation
are,</P>
<P>1. PEPPER, most of which is exported
again; our Home Consumption being small,
'tis exported chiefly to <HI>Italy, viz.</HI> to <HI>Leg∣horn,
Genoa</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and to <HI>France,</HI>
the Quantity used at Home, is about 6000
Bags a Year. The rest is sent Abroad.</P>
<P>2. TOBACCO, the Quantity exported by
Certificate, generally speaking, may be esti∣mated
at about 30000 Hogsheads, and the
Quantity consum'd in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> to 50000 more, in which I am
sure to be a great deal within Compass. We
are told, that since the late Peace, <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="274"/>
alone has taken off 10000 Hogsheads of
Tobacco in a Year, and sometimes more;
the rest is exported to <HI>Holland,</HI> to <HI>Germa∣ny,
Norway,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>N.B. By the Word <HI>Germany,</HI> I am to
be understood now, and at other Times,
when speaking of Marine or Trading
Affairs, the Coast of <HI>Germany,</HI> from
the <HI>Emhs</HI> to the <HI>Elb</HI> inclusive, which
takes in the Cities of <HI>Embden, Bre∣men,
Hamburg,</HI> and all the Ports in
and between those Rivers, with the
Coaft of <HI>Holstein</HI> or <HI>Holsatia,</HI> the Ri∣ver
<HI>Eider</HI> to <HI>Hsum,</HI> and the Coast of
<HI>Juitland.</HI></P>
<P>5. SUGARS, Indigo, Ginger and Rice:
These, and the Tobacco also, as they are
the Growth of the <HI>British</HI> Colonies, and
the Returns for all the Exportations thither,
not from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from the Coast of <HI>Afric</HI>
also, are in the Language of Trade, to be
esteemed as Exportations from <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
and are, without Dispute, Branches of
the <HI>British Commerce;</HI> The Value of these
is hard to determine; the Quantity of Sugar
and Rice is exceeding great, the Sugars espe∣cially
which are shipp'd off to <HI>Holland,</HI> and
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> where they are us'd
by the Sugar Bakers, as we simply call them;
for they ought to be called Sugar Boilers,
but are more properly called Abroad, Sugar
Resiners.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="275"/>
WE are supposed to export more than
40000 Hogsheads of Sugar a Year, one Year
with another; some times much more, as the
Crops of Sugar Abroad may yield, which
are often very different.</P>
<P>AS to the Rice, it is a new Trade, being
the Product of one Colony only, namely
of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and has been brought over in
Quantity but a few Years; but it is an en∣creasing
Trade, and is now spread into <HI>Pen∣sylvania,</HI>
and other Places: But be the
Quantity what it will, it goes most of it
Abroad again, and is a very acceptable
Merchandize to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> (un∣derstood
as above) and is likely to be a very
great Article in our <HI>American</HI> Returns.</P>
<P>4. WE must not omit here the <HI>African</HI>
Trade, as it regards the exporting Slaves
from thence to the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in
<HI>America,</HI> particularly to the Islands, and to
<HI>Virginia,</HI> for the other <HI>British</HI> Colonies do
not much make use of them, I mean, <HI>New-England,
New-York, Carolina,</HI> &amp;c. As these
Slaves are the Produce of the British Com∣merce
in their <HI>African</HI> Factories; they are
so far a Branch of the <HI>British</HI> Exportation,
just as if they were first brought to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
landed here, and then sent Abroad
again, or exported by Certificate (for it
would be the same thing) to the <HI>West In∣dies,</HI>
or by the South-Sea Company to
<HI>New Spain</HI></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="276"/>
THE Number of these is very great, and
the Value of them very considerable. The
Rate of <HI>Negroes</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as it is of late
Years risen in all the Colonies, is from 20
to 25 to 30 l. a Head, according to the
Age, the Growth, and the Sex of the Ne∣groes;
and if we allow 30000 to 40 and
50000 Negroes a Year to be carried away,
as (if the Trade was uninterrupted) would
be the Case; then the Value of this Trade
at a Medium of 25 l. <HI>per Head</HI> upon all
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> amounts to no less than One
Million two hundred and fifty thousand
Pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Trade of infinite Advantage,
considering that these Negroes do not cost
in the Country above 30 to 50 <HI>s. per</HI> Head;
and if the Trade was uninterrupted, as it
might, and I think indeed merits to be, we
should, no doubt, including the <HI>Assiento,</HI>
carry 40 to 50000 Slaves a Year from the
Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and find Business enough
for them all in our encreasing Colonies.</P>
<P>THERE are several other Branches of
Commerce which might enlarge the Sub∣ject,
but I strive to contract it; and there∣fore
say no more to that Part.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Solid Enquiry into that important
Question, whether our Trade in
general, and our Woollen Manu∣facture
in particular, are sunk
and declined, or not.</HEAD>
<P>- WE have been very much alar∣med
of late with publick
Complaints of the Decay of
our Trade; I think the Peo∣ple
who thus complain, ought
to be seriously asked to ex∣plain
themselves, <HI>and to tell us,</HI></P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> WHETHER they mean in general,
that the Bulk of our whole Commerce is
<PB N="246" REF="278"/>
lessened and decayed, and that there was
any Time formerly, when it was greater
than it is now.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> OR whether they mean in parti∣cular,
that any of our Manufactures are un∣der
Decay, that their Consumption is less
now Abroad, or at Home, than it has been;
or that there is any Appearance that it may
be so.</P>
<P>IF they mean the <HI>First,</HI> they ought to
tell us when that Time was, and how they
prove the Fact? Then we might enter with
them into a calm Examination of the Thing,
judge of the Calculations they make; and
by the Particulars, as they shall lay them
down determine whether they complain
with Reason, or without.</P>
<P>WHILE instead of this, they content them∣selves
with a meer Suggestion, making a
Complaint in general, claiming to have it
be believed in the gross, as they bring it,
without farther Enquiry. This seems to
be a Kind of Popery in Commerce, de∣manding
our implicit Assent to what we
cannot believe, or they demonstrate; beg∣ging
the Question in the grossest Sense,
and in short is rather a Clamour than a
Complaint, and ought to be treated as
such.</P>
<P>IF I should deal with these People, as
they deal with us, I ought to answer them
also in gross, and affirm, which I believe
I am much better furnish'd with Argu∣ments
<PB N="247" REF="279"/>
to prove, that the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI>
Commerce is at this Time so far from a
Decay, that it is encreased to a Magnitude
far greater than it ever was before, and is
still encreasing more and more; in a Word,
that our Trade is in a more flourishing Con∣dition
than the Trade of any other Nation
in <HI>Europe,</HI> perhaps in the World.</P>
<P>IT is true, that as this is affrming with∣out
Evidence, so it is answering without
Proof, and is only paying them back the
same Kind they bring; but I shall descend
to Particulars in its Place, and explain my
self at large; at present I must go on with
the Complainers.</P>
<P>IF they mean the <HI>second,</HI> that any parti∣cular
Branch of our Commerce is decay'd,
as especially our Manufactures, which is
what they seem to point at, <HI>they ought then</HI>
to have descended to the Particulars of those
Manufactures which they say are decay'd,
seeing 'tis evident some of our Manufactures
are exceedingly encreased; nay, the Trade,
or general Term, <HI>our Manufactures,</HI> or the
<HI>British Manufactures.</HI> are encreased; and
we call several Manufactures our own, and
justly too, which never were so before:
Of which also in its Order.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> HERE I should observe, that we
ought to distinguish thus between the
Decay of the general Commerce of a
Nation, and the Decay of any parti∣cular
Branch of it; because some parti∣cular
<PB N="248" REF="280"/>
Manufacture may decay, and
even wear out, in a Country, and some
other may rise up in its Place; as the
Custom, Fashions, and Fancies of the
Times may influence and direct, and
of which many Examples are just now
to be seen among us; and yet at the
same Time the general Commerce may
not at all be decayed or decreased.</P>
<P>BUT to bring the Complaint mention'd
above to a Point, and to understand it, as
I suppose the Complainers would be under∣stood,
however lamely they express it: By
the Decay of our Trade, they seem to
mean this, and no more, namely, a Decay
of the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>This they alledge is in a declining Con∣dition,
and they tell us for Proof of it,
That the Consumption is lessened, both
<HI>Abroad</HI> and at <HI>Home.</HI></P>
<P>1. THAT <HI>'tis lessen'd;</HI> this they say is
evident, by other Nations falling into the
Way of manufacturing their own Wool;
imitating our Manufacture to great Per∣fection;
their People underworking ours,
and their Tradesmen therefore underselling
ours in Price at Market; their Govern∣ments
respectively, for Encouragement of
their own Poor, pressing the Consumption
of those Manufactures among them sclves,
and prohibiting the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures
being importetd into their Dominions. This
<PB N="249" REF="281"/>
they think amounts to a Demonstration of
the Decay of our Trade.</P>
<P>To clear our Hands of Things, as we
go, I shall answer this briefly, the Fact is
true, but the Inserence is false.</P>
<P><HI>1st. The Fact is true,</HI> (in part, tho' not
in the whole) the Wealth of <HI>England</HI> ha∣ving
been so visibly raised, by the Improve∣ment
of our Woollen Manufacture, (not
forgetting our loud and impolitick Boasts of
that Wealth too, and how the Woollen Ma∣nufacture
has been the only Cause of it). This
has set other Nations at Work as far as they
can, <HI>tho' the farthest has been but little,</HI> to
imitate those Manufactures; to work up
their own Wool, and employ their own
Poor; and we have no Reason to blame
or reproach them with it at all; we do the
same.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> FOR the Encouragement of the
People to do thus in those particular Coun∣tries,
their Princes have, generally speaking,
prohibited the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, espe∣cially
such Kinds, as their Subjects can make,
from being imported into their Dominions;
nor can we blame the said Princes for this,
for we do the same. Thus far I say is
true.</P>
<P>3. BUT the Inference is false, the Trade,
no nor the Manufacture is not decay'd for
this; these Prohibitions and Imitations
amount to no more than this, that the
People of those Countries do make some
<PB N="250" REF="282"/>
woollen Goods there, such as the course
Wool of <HI>Saxony, Poland, Bohemia,</HI> &amp;c. will
admit; and thus the poor People in those
Countries may be said to be clothed with
their own Manufacture; but it seems to be
little more, than instead of the rough Sheep-Skins,
which, 'tis known, the Boors in
those Countries wore before: For we find
the very coursest of our Kersies, Dozens,
Duffells, and <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Cloths, which are
the meanst of our Manufacture, are ex∣ported
even to those northern Ports (where
they were used to go) in as great Quanti∣ties
as ever: As for the fine Medly
broad Cloths, and <HI>Spanish</HI> Cloths, which
<HI>England</HI> is so particularly noted for, they
do not so much as pretend to imitate, or
to prohibit them; but the Quantity ex∣ported
to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to <HI>Gottenburgh,</HI> to
<HI>Dantzick,</HI> and to all the <HI>Baltick,</HI> is as
great as ever, and perhaps greater; and if I
were to go thro' all the Ports of <HI>Europe</HI>
with the Enquiry, it would be hard to
shew where the Decay lyes; but that if
one Place sinks, another rises; and if one
Kind of Manufacture declines, another ad∣vances.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THESE Prohibitions have been,
some of longer standing, such as in
<HI>France, Prussia, Sweden,</HI> &amp;c. and some
of a shorter Date, as now lately in <HI>Si∣lesia,</HI>
in <HI>Austria,</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> and se∣veral
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and at last in
<PB N="251" REF="283"/>
<HI>Spain;</HI> and we may expect the like in
other Parts.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, admitting all these Pro∣hibitions
of our Manufactures, and all their
being imitated and set up in foreign Parts,
<HI>as above,</HI> yet it is not easy to prove, neither
can I see Reason to allow, that the Expor∣tation
of the woollen Manufacture of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
is at all lessen'd, and consequently, the
Consumption Abroad is not abated, or the
Trade in particular decay'd: What Abate∣ment
of the Consumption may have hap∣pen'd
in this, or that particular Part of the
World, is not the Case, nor is it worth
our Debate; all Nations are, and ought to
be at Liberty to set their own Poor at
Work, if they can, and to prohibit what
foreign Manufacture they please for their
Encouragement: But as the woollen Ma∣nufacture
of <HI>England</HI> is an Article the most
extended in Trade, of any other Thing of
its Kind in the World, it cannot be ex∣pected,
but it may sink in one Place, and
rise in another; flourish here, and decay
there, and the demand alter, as the Cus∣toms
of Countries alter, and yet the Gross
of the Trade may be the same; As the
Sea, they tell us, gains in one Place upon
the Land, and the Land encroaches in ano∣ther
Place upon the Sea; and yet, neither
the Sea or the Land abates or encreases in
Quantity, only vary in their Situation: And
thus it is in our Trade, the Consumption of
<PB N="252" REF="284"/>
the Manufacture spreads in one Place, and
draws back in another; one Nation opens
the Door to it, and another shuts the Door
against it; but still the Quantity goes away,
it is exported abroad, bought, sold, and
consum'd; and we do not find any Age
pass, when more of it, either in Quan∣tity
or Quality, was ever sent abroad, than
is now, or so much by a great deal: How
then is the Trade under a Decay?</P>
<P>3. THE next Branch of the Complaint,
is, that the Consumption of our woollen
Manufacture is lessen'd at HOME.</P>
<P>THIS indeed, tho' least regarded, has
the most Truth and Reason in it, and me∣rits
to be more particularly enquired into:
But I might ask the very Complainer him∣self
here, supposing the Fact to be true,
Why do we not mend it, and that without
Laws, without teising the Parliament and
our Sovereign, for what they find difficult
enough to effect, even by Law? I say, Why
do not the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by ge∣neral
Custom, and by universal Consent, en∣crease
the Consumption of our own Manu∣factures,
by rejecting the Trifles and Toys of
Foreigners, why do we not appear dress'd
in the Growth of our own Country, and
made fine by the Labour of our own Hands?</P>
<P>All the Kings and Parliaments that have
been or shall be, cannot govern our Fancies:
They may make Laws, and shew you the
Reason of those Laws for your Good; but
<PB N="253" REF="285"/>
two Things among us are too ungoverna∣ble,
<HI>viz.</HI> our Passions and our Fashions;
the first is at present out of my Way, but
the second is directly to my Purpose.</P>
<P>SHOULD I ask the Ladies, whether they
would dress by Law, or clothe by Act of
Parliament, they would ask me whether
they were to be Statute Fools, and to be
made Pageants and Pictures of? Whether
the Sex were to be set up for our Jest, and
the Parliament had nothing to do, but
make <HI>Indian</HI> Queens of them.? That they
claim <HI>English</HI> Liberty, as well as the Men,
and as they expect to do what they please,
and say what they please, so they will wear
what they please, and dress how they
please.</P>
<P>IT is true, that this Liberty of the La∣dies,
their <HI>Passion</HI> for their <HI>Fashion,</HI> has
been frequently injurious to the Manufac∣tures
of <HI>England;</HI> and is so still in some Ca∣ses,
as I shall observe again in its Place;
but I do not see so easy a Remedy for that,
as for some other Things of the like Na∣ture.
The Ladies have suffer'd some little
Restraint that Way, as in the wearing <HI>East-India</HI> Silks, instead of <HI>English;</HI> and Calli∣coes,
and other Things, instead of worsted
Stuffs, <HI>and the like;</HI> and we do not see they
are pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>BUT as I am talking in this Article to
the Complainers, I would have them di∣rect
their Complaints where they ought to
<PB N="254" REF="286"/>
be directed; the King and Parliament have
restrain'd those Things by Law, and farther
they really cannot go; we must turn the
Complaint to the People themselves, and en∣treat
them to encourage the Manufacture of
<HI>England</HI> by a more general Use and Wearing
of it. This alone would encrease the Con∣sumption,
and that alone can encrease the Ma∣nufacture
it self, as we shall see in its Place.</P>
<P>AND yet, if even this Part were examin'd
critically, it would appear, that the Com∣plaint
is not right plac'd; the Manufacture
is not in its self declin'd so much, as the
Consumption is divided into several Ma∣nufactures,
which perhaps were not known
before, but under one Denomination; such
as the Cotton Manufacture in <HI>Lancashire</HI>
and <HI>Cheshire,</HI> the Linen Manufacture in
<HI>Scotland</HI> now become our own by the Uni∣on;
and the Linen Manufacture much en∣creas'd
of late in <HI>England</HI> it self, and the
same in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which tho' not our own,
we find it much for our Interest to encou∣rage;
if by the Consumption of these the
Consumption of the Woollen Manufacture
is divided, I cannot lay this can be call'd a
Decay of our Trade, at least as the Use of
these Goods is now brought on, not in the
Room of our Woollen Manufacture, but
in the Room of the Callicocs, the Use of
which was lately prohibited: They are not
there fore the Reason of any present Decay of
the Woollen Manufacture; but if there
<PB N="255" REF="287"/>
was a Decay in the Consumption of the
Woollen, it was done by the said Callicoes
before; of all which I shall speak as I
go on.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then it does not ap∣pear,
that our Manufactures are lessen'd,
or that the Consumption of them is abated
either Abroad or at Home, but rather the
contrary; and that our Trade in general,
and even our Woollen Manufacture in par∣ticular,
is greatly encreas'd, and is at this
Time arriv'd to such a Magnitude, as it
was never at before. And here it occurs
to notice a particular Thing, which may
be of Use to us in its Kind, on several Oc∣casions,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Magnitude of the
Manufacture is really at present its only
Grievance, being encreased to such a De∣gree,
by the Ignorance and Wealth of the
Manufacturers, that it is too great for its
self; the Quantity too great for the Con∣sumption,
or at least too great for the Mar∣ket,
tho' the Market was intirely open, and
uninterrupted by any Rival Manufacture,
or any Prohibition whatsoever. And here I
ask to be spared a Word or two of the pre∣sent
imprudent Encrease of the Woollen Ma∣nufacture
of <HI>England,</HI> by the ill Conduct of
the Manufacturers in particular Cases; and
how unjustly a Check of that Encrease is
called a Decay of the Trade.</P>
<P>AS the Veins may be too full of Blood,
so a Nation may be too full of Trade; the
<PB N="256" REF="288"/>
fine fresh Rivers, when they run with a
full and gentle Stream, are the Beauty and
Glory of a Country; they water the Mea∣dows,
moisten the Earth, drive our Mills,
fill our Moats and Canals, carry our Ves∣sels,
and enrich the whole Nation; but
when swell'd by sudden and hasty Showers,
they turn rapid in their Course, over∣flow
their Banks, and rise to an undue
Height; then they turn frightful and dange∣rous,
drown the Country, and sometimes
the People; carry away Cattle, Stacks of
Corn, Bridges, Buildings, and whatever
stands in their Way, leaving Mud, and
Sand, and Stones among the Grass, and ra∣ther
starve the Land, than assist to make
it fruitful, and thus they become a Grievance,
not a Blessing to the Publick; on the other
Hand, when by long Drought their Sour∣ces
are withheld, the Streams fail, the Ri∣vers
are dry, the Mills stand still, the Boats
lye a Ground, the Lands are parch'd up, and
the whole Country suffers.</P>
<P>OUR Manufactures of Wool in this Na∣tion,
bear a just Analogy with this Case,
like a flowing Stream, they are in their
prosperous Course the Wealth and Glo∣ry
of the Country: While the Trade
flourishes Abroad and at Home, and the
Consumption makes a moderate current
Demand, the Manufacture goes on at a
steady, chearful, even Pace, the Wool is con∣sum'd
and wrought up, the Poor are em∣ploy'd,
<PB N="257" REF="289"/>
the Master Manufacturer thrives,
the Merchant and the Shop-keepers go
on with their usual Strength, and all the
Trade flourishes.</P>
<P>1. UPON some sudden Accident in Trade
here comes a great unusual Demand for
Goods, the Merchants from Abroad have
sudden and unusual Commissions, the Call
for Goods this Way or that Way encreases,
this makes the Factors send large Orders into
the Country; and the Price of Goods always
rises according to the Demand: The Country
Manufacturer looks out sharp, hires more
Looms, gets more Spinners, gives more
Wages, and animated by the advane'd Price,
is not content to answer his new Orders
only, but he continues the Excursion he
had made into the Country for Spinners,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> runs on to an Extremity, in Quantity,
as far, or perhaps farther, than his Stock
will allow; and in a Word, gluts the Mar∣ket
with the Goods.</P>
<P>2. THE. Accident of Trade, which from
Abroad fill'd the Merchants Commissions,
and the Factor's Orders being over, those
Demands are also over, and the Trade re∣turns
to its usual Channel; but the Manu∣facturer
in the Country, who had run out
to an unusual Excess in his Business, with∣out
Regard to the Circumstanecs of it,
having not stopt his Hand as his Or∣ders
stopt, falls into the Mire; his Goods
lye on Hand, the Poor which he call'd
<PB N="258" REF="290"/>
from the Plow and the Dary to spin and
weave, are cast off again, and not finding
their Way presently back to their old
Drudgery, lye and starve for Want of Work,
and then they cry out Trade is decay'd,
the Manufactures are lost, Foreigners en∣croach
upon, us, the Poor are starv'd, and
the like.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the Sum of the Matter is, the
Manufacturer went mad, his Stream run
over into a Flood, he run himself impru∣dently
out of Breath; and upon a little
Start of the Trade, willing to furnish the
Orders all himself, and loth to let a Neigh∣bour
come in with him, run himself out,
drag'd the Poor into his Business, nay per∣haps
robb'd his poorer Neighbour of his
Workmen, by giving high Wages; and
when the Trade stops a little, he runs
a-ground; so the Poor are starving, and
ready to mutiny for Want of Work: And
this we call a Decay of Trade, whereas
the contrary is manifest several Ways.</P>
<P>TRADE must certainly decay, if we will
run it up to such a Length, as to make
more Goods than the World can consume:
But it is not to be justly call'd a Decay
of Trade, 'tis only abating of the Flood;
the Waters were out, and now they
are down again, and reduced to their old
Channel.</P>
<P>LET us examine a little such Accidents
as may raise or sink our Manufacture as
<PB N="259" REF="291"/>
above, or as perhaps have done so at this
Time, and see if it does not hit exactly
with this Account.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> THE late Accident of a Plague in
<HI>France.</HI> Upon that sad Occasion, the Com∣merce
being entirely stop'd between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and indeed all other Parts of the
World, the Manufactures of the City of
<HI>Marseilles</HI> in particular, and the Country
adjacent, being wholly interrupted, occa∣sion'd
a very great Addition to the Trade
of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> particularly for such
Manufactures as the <HI>French</HI> used to send to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> and to <HI>Italy;</HI> and the
Merchants Commissions from Abroad were
visibly enlarged hither for near two Years,
upon that particular Occasion: It was plain
they cou'd have no Goods from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE like Occasion added to the Encrease
of our Trade, upon the concluding of the
Treaty of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> after the Confusions in
<HI>Spain</HI> had put a Check to the Trade be∣tween
<HI>England</HI> and that Country, for se∣veral
Years; as likewise again upon the
Accommodation with <HI>Spain,</HI> after the Sur∣render
of <HI>Sicily,</HI> when Trade breaking out
like the Sun after an Eclipse, the Demand
for our <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, Bayes, Says,
Perpetts, broad Cloaths, Serges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was
such, that the Manufacturers thought they
could never make too many.</P>
<P>THESE Excursions are not to be cast up
in any View of the real Magnitude of
<PB N="260" REF="292"/>
the Trade, or of the Manufacture, any
more than the true Channel of a River is
to be judged of, or its Waters measured
by the overflowing of a Winter's Rain, as
above.</P>
<P>NOR on the contrary is the Stop of those
sudden high Demands, by any extraordi∣nary
Check of the Call on like Accidents,
to be esteemed a Decay of the Trade, any
more than the dry Bottom of a large River,
when the Stream withheld by a Summer's
Drought leaves the Channel empty, can de∣scribe
the usual Dimensions of that River,
or Quantity of its Waters.</P>
<P>SHOULD we ever see here such a fatal
Time as that was in <HI>France,</HI> when Heaven
sent the Infection among them at <HI>Mar∣seilles,</HI>
or as was here in 1665, <HI>God pre∣serve
us from it,</HI> what a general Stop
would it make to all our Trade? who would
send any Commissions hither for <HI>English</HI>
Manufactures, when they did not know but
every Bale would have a Plague pack'd up
with the Goods, as certainly as the Bales
of Wool or Hair brought it from <HI>Cyprus</HI>
to <HI>Marseilles?</HI></P>
<P>YET this would not justly be call'd a De∣cay
of our Commerce; it would indeed be
a Wound, and a very desperate Blow to it
for the Time; but as it was an Accident to
the Trade, so the Cause being removed,
the Trade would revive, return to its for∣mer
Channel, and be the same as before.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="293"/>
IF now (<HI>to return to the Case before us</HI>)
the Manufacturers of <HI>Britain,</HI> upon any
such hasty Demand from Abroad, shall run
rashly out into Extremes in their Business,
seek out of their usual Bounds for Spinners
and Weavers, and other working People,
and draw them by Thousands, and Hun∣dreds
of Thousands, as was lately the Case,
from their other Imployments, shall they
call the Stop of these hasty Demands
a Decay of Trade? 'tis a Mistake, it is
no Decay, it is no more but a Return
of the Stream to its usual stated Bounds,
bringing Trade into its right Channel again,
and to run as it did before: And this I
take to be the State of our Manufacture at
this Time.</P>
<P>IT is indeed something difficult to make
an exact Calculation, and judge between
the antient and the present Bounds of Trade,
and especially of the Woollen Manufa∣cture;
but I'll make a brief Essay at it.</P>
<P>THE Woll is the principal Fund of the
Manufacture, 'tis the Stock upon which it
is carry'd on. Now, be the Quantity
more or less, 'tis the fixt Boundary of the
Trade: The Manufacture cannot outrun
this Tether; the Maker can go no further
than he has Wooll. to work on; sometimes
indeed one Year may borrow a little of
another, but that is generally not so much
as Trade demands more or less, but as the
Stock of Wooll appears to vary: But when
<PB N="262" REF="294"/>
there is an apparent Decay or Advance of
the Trade in general, then it is to be seen
in the Wooll And thus, I remember, be∣fore
the Stop was put to the free Exporta∣tion
of the <HI>Irish</HI> Woollen Manufacture,
the Quantity of the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> was
too great for the Manufacture; and I have
heard the Farmers complain of having two
or three Years Stock of Wooll before-hand,
and that they could not pay their Rent, be∣cause
they could not sell it off.</P>
<P>THEN it was our great Study to get the
Wooll consum'd, as appears by the Act of
Parliament for burying in Woollen; you
may see by the Preamble to that Act, that
it was thought to be a publick Good to
waste and consume the Wooll.</P>
<P>SINCE that, we find all the Wooll in
<HI>England</HI> too little for the Manufacture; so
that now we bring in all the Wooll of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
which is in short an immense Quan∣tity,
tho' coarse, and which went formerly
most of it beyond Sea, and yet call for at
least the Quantity of an Hundred thou∣sand
Horse Packs from <HI>Ireland</HI> every Year.
This is but a very odd Testimony for the
Decay of our Manufacture; on the other
hand, I think it is an unanswerable Proof
of what I have advanced, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that our
Woollen Manufacture is very much en∣creased:
But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>THEY that tell us of the Encrease or De∣cay
of the Woollen Manufacture, should
<PB N="263" REF="295"/>
fix a Standard of the Trade, from a Propor∣tion
to which, to denominate this En∣crease
or Decay: To tell us it is sunk from
what it was just at such or such a Time,
as upon a Peace, after a long Interruption
by a War, or after a Plague or the like, is
to say nothing at all. But let them take
six or seven Years together, and make an
Estimate from the Medium, take the Ex∣portation
at a Medium, or take the Rate
of Wooll, and the Consumption of the
Quantity at a Medium, and then their
Guesses (for they can be no more) may at
least be probable.</P>
<P>IF formerly we could not consume all
our own Wooll; and now, we not only
consume our own, but all the Wooll of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and an Hundred thousand Packs
a Year from <HI>Ireland;</HI> then either <HI>England</HI>
must produce less Wooll than formerly, or
the Consumption must be so much the
greater. I think, that way of Reasoning
is liable to no Exception, except it be the
running it away clandestinely to <HI>France,</HI>
which is trifling, and I shall make it ap∣pear
in its Place, that this Channel is much
smaller than it was formerly, when our
Wooll lay unsold, as above.</P>
<P>AS to the Growth of our Wooll being
alter'd, and that <HI>England</HI> produces less
Wooll than formerly, 'tis time enough to
argue upon it, when there is, or can be
one probable Reason given to suggest it,
<PB N="264" REF="296"/>
much less Evidence to prove it; yet I must
not wholly pass it by neither, because, as
above, it is the only Exception.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing to be judg'd of
from Probability, it is on the other Side,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) 'tis rather probable the Quantity is
encreased by the innumerable Number of
Acres of Land improved and enclosed with∣in
these few Years, especially in the North∣west
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and which breed and
feed greater Numbers of Sheep than ever,
and those of a larger Breed which are pro∣digiously
encreased in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I might run out here very profitably up∣on
this Subject, and give Reasons from
the general Way of Sheep-keeping in
<HI>England</HI> at this Time, by which it wou'd
easily be proved, that the Quantity of Wooll
is encreased by the Encrease of the large
Breed of Sheep which are raised now, <HI>not</HI>
on the <HI>Cotswold</HI> Hills of <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI>
the South <HI>Downs, Salisbury</HI> Plains, and
such open Counties, as formerly, where the
Soil is poor, and the Sheep small, and the
Fleeces light, tho' sine, and of a short Sta∣ple
in Proportion to the Creatures: <HI>But</HI> in
the rich enclosed Grounds of <HI>Leicester</HI> and
<HI>Warwickshire,</HI> the Fens of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> and
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> the lsle of <HI>Ely,</HI> the Marshes of
<HI>Rum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the rich Lands on the Bank
of <HI>Tees</HI> and on the <HI>Wier</HI> in the Bishoprick of
<HI>Durham,</HI> and thro' all the Counties of
<HI>Northampton, Huntington, Hertford,</HI> and
<PB N="265" REF="297"/>
<HI>Bucks;</HI> for the Truth of which, I need do
no more than appeal to the Knowledge of
the honourable Representatives of those
Countries.</P>
<P>AS the Encrease of these Sheep is manifest,
and that one of whose Fleeces is equal to
three of the western Counties, 'tis very im∣probable
the Quantity of Wooll should be de∣clin'd
in <HI>England;</HI> and if the Wooll is not de∣clin'd,
then the only tolerable Objection is
removed, and my Argument stands granted,
or at least fully confirmed, of which this is
the Abstract.</P>
<P>WHEN the Growth of our Wooll in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
was much less than it is now, yet there
were frequent Difficulties in having it be
consumed by the Manufactures.</P>
<P>NOW the Growth of Wooll in <HI>England</HI>
is encreased, yet it is not sufficient to supply
the Consumption of it by the Manufactures.</P>
<P>I think the Consequence is natural then,
namely, that the Manufactures must be
encreased.</P>
<P>TO bring all this to our present Purpose,</P>
<P>THE Manufactures are prodigiously en∣creased,
whether prudently, or rashly, be∣yond
a due Proportion to the Demand,
it matters not upon a Stop or Check of
that Demand, we complain of a Decay
of Trade; the Question is, whether that
Complaint is just?</P>
<P>I insist, that it is not, nor does it prove
any thing of a Decay of Trade; only, that
<PB N="266" REF="298"/>
the Manufacturers having rashly made im∣mense
Quantities of Goods more than the
Trade of all <HI>Europe</HI> ever did or can call
for in a constant Demand, the Trade is re∣turned
to its natural Channel, after an ima∣ginary
and casual Start out of it by the Ac∣cidents
of foreign Commerce.</P>
<P>IN short, upon the Occasions mentioned
above, the Manufacturers have made their
good Fortune in Trade a Bubble upon them∣selves,
and having over-run the Market with
their Goods, it returns upon them like the
late <HI>South Sea,</HI> and every thing goes back
from its imaginary to its intrinsick Value.</P>
<P>THE Demand abates the Advancement,
the Price sinks, the poor Spinners and Work∣folk
are dismiss'd to starve: But the Cause is
not in the Trade, but in the Workmen, not
in the Manufacture, but in the Manufactu∣rers;
the Quantity of Goods made are too
many for the Consumption, and the Market
is perhaps glutted for a Year or more to
come; and thus and no otherwise the Com∣merce
is abated; that is, there is no real
Abatement of the Trade, only it must have
Time given to waste the over-made
Quantity.</P>
<P>FROM the whole we may observe here
how many Ways the launching out a Manu∣facture
to an undue Extent may be prejudi∣cial
to a Nation in general; 'tis like a Trades∣man
that over-trades himself, and runs out
beyond the Compass of his Stock; the Con∣sequence
<PB N="267" REF="299"/>
is, that upon the least Accident in
Trade, his Credit is stagnated and shaken,
and the Man is undone; and 'tis a just Ob∣servation
in the Tradesmen of this Nation,
that there are many more ruined by too
much Trade, than for Want of Trade.</P>
<P>IT is very unjust and unfair Dealing by
the Publick, first to glut the Market, and
over-run it with Goods, and then complain
that the Market is dull: How should the
Respiration of Trade be preserved, when
'tis choak'd and suffocated with Goods?
When <HI>Blackwell</HI> Hall is empty, the Trade
breathes; but when we see it piled up to
the Ceilings; the Yards, the Passages and
Staircases throng'd, Trade suffers, it is
oppress'd with Quantity, and must die if
not relieved.</P>
<P>LET the Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> go on in
its usual Channel, the Magnitude of it is
sufficient of it self; all Excesses hurt it; I do
not think Trade receives any Advantage
from those sudden Starts and Advances of
Price, as hinted above, but what the Manu∣facturer
makes one Way, he loses another,
and the Poor lose by it both ways.</P>
<P>I remember after the late Plague in <HI>France,</HI>
and the Peace in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Run for Goods
was so great in <HI>England,</HI> and the Price of
every thing rose so high, that the poor Wo∣men
in <HI>Essex</HI> could earn one Shilling to
one Shilling and Sixpence <HI>per diem</HI> by
<PB N="268" REF="300"/>
Spinning: What was the Consequence,
'twas too plain to be conceal'd.</P>
<P>THE poor Farmers could get no Dary-Maids;
the Wenches told them in so many
Words, they would not go to Service for
Twelve-pence a Week, when they could get
nine Shillings a <HI>Week at their own Hands,</HI> as
they called it; so they all run away to <HI>Bock∣ings</HI>
to <HI>Sudbury,</HI> to <HI>Braintree,</HI> and to
<HI>Colchester,</HI> and other Manufacturing Towns
of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>The very Plowmen did the same, and
the Ale-houses in the great Towns were
throng'd with them, young Fellows and
young Wenches together, till the Parishes
began to take Cognizance of them upon
another Account, too dark to talk of here.</P>
<P>WHILE this Hurry lasted, the Bayes were
call'd for in prodigious Quantities, and the
Price rose from 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Ell to 16 <HI>d.</HI> besides
the Advance upon the Parcels, an Article
particular to that Business.</P>
<P>As soon as the Demand slack'd from
Abroad, all these loose People were turn'd
off, the Spinners went a begging, the Wea∣vers
rose in Rebellion, and the Parishes
were left throng'd with Bastards, which was
all that we might say was got by that
Bargain.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, had the Merchants been ob∣liged
with the Goods as fast as the ordina∣ry
Numbers employ'd in the Manufacture
could have wrought them, the Market had
<PB N="269" REF="301"/>
held the longer, the Merchants had had
their Goods the cheaper, and the Markets
Abroad would have been supplied at last
too.</P>
<P>BUT, by that unadvised rash Hurry, no∣thing
follow'd but Confusion; the Demand
stopt; yet the Makers run on as long as they
were able, the Bayes were pawned in every
money'd Man's Hand in the Country, and the
Price sunk to 11 d. <HI>per</HI> Yard at <HI>London;</HI> so
that a considerable deal of Money was lost
by every Piece made, the <HI>Bay - Makers</HI>
broke by Dozens, and thus they went on;
and now they as well as the West Country
Men tell us, that the Trade is declin'd.</P>
<P>NOW is this to be called a Decay of
Trade? no not at all; there is still a mode∣rate
Demand, and the Trade, were the
Glut of Goods taken off, would be where it
was: But the Run has ruin'd them; the
Money to be gotten blinded the Manufac∣turers,
they could not keep within the Com∣pass
of their own Grasp, and so sunk in the
necessary Stop of the Trade that follow'd.</P>
<P>TO judge then of the Decay of the Trade,
we must bring it back, as I said, to a Medi∣um
of Years, and see how it was carry'd on,
and to what Degree, in such a Time, for
10, or 20, or 30 Years ago, and then com∣pare
it with its present worst Circumstances,
and I venture to say, we shall not find the
Trade decay'd at all, but rather encreased
in all the Manufactures of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="302"/>
I have dwelt upon the encreasing Expor∣tations
of our own, and Importations of
the Goods of foreign Growth, in the three
last Chapters, as an Evidence of the Magni∣tude
of our Trade. If our Trade is declin∣ing,
why do our Importations and Expor∣tations
encrease? And if they do not en∣crease,
let the Opposer of this Part tell us
the Time when they were greater, or even
equal to what they are.</P>
<P>SOME have attempted this Part, and in∣deed
'tis the only way to convince us, that
our Trade is declined; for if neither our Im∣portations
or Exportations are decreased,
which Way will they go to Work to shew
the Decrease of our Commerce.</P>
<P>I might enquire of these phlegmatick
Computers, first, Whether is our Shipping
decreas'd or not? I confess, I have not yet
heard it so much as suggested; and tho' it
is true, that it is not easy to determine that
Point, yet I think I am upon a Square with
the Complainers, when I say, that when
ever they please to enter into the Computa∣tion,
I shall be ready to begin an Enquiry
on the other side, which I believe will be
convincing; in the mean time, let me refer
the Reader to a View of the Western Coast
of the Island, and let them look narrowly
into the Encrease of Shipping at <HI>Bristol,
Liverpool, Whitehaven, Dumfreis, Glas∣gow,</HI>
and all the smaller Ports on that
Side from <HI>Pembroke</HI> Haven to the Firth of
<PB N="271" REF="303"/>
<HI>Clyde,</HI> and tell me if there are not a thou∣sand
Sail of Ships more employ'd on that
Side, I mean Merchant Ships, besides Fish∣ing
Boats and small Craft, more than were
ever known before. I might go round the
Island, and make like Observations; but, as
before, I meet with no body that makes any
Objection of that kind.</P>
<P>WE have two Trades, they tell us, which
are evidently declin'd, and the Shipping,
which was usually employ'd in them, ap∣parently
lessen'd;
and these are first, the
<HI>French</HI> Trade, and secondly, the Fishing
Trade.</P>
<P>FOR the first, <HI>'tis true,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Trade
is lessen'd; but 'tis a Truth so evidently,
and I might say so infinitely, to our Advan∣tage,
by our having made almost all their
Manufactures (of which we took off such
exceeding great Quantities) our own; that
no Man can with Justice call it a Decay or
Declining of our Trade in general, that our
Trade with <HI>France</HI> is lessen'd; on the con∣trary,
'tis no more than this, all that Part
of our Trade, which we lost by, is lessen'd,
and all that Part, which we gain'd by, is
or might be, if we pleas'd, encreased and
preserv'd; whoever considers the Importa∣tions
of wrought Silks, Brandy, Paper,
Hats, Glass, and several other Manufactures,
for which we paid <HI>France</HI> two Millions a
Year, turn'd all upon their Hands, and all
those things supply'd at Home by the La∣bour
<PB N="272" REF="304"/>
of our own People. For even the
Gross of the Brandy, formerly <HI>French,</HI> is
now supply'd by the Distillers of Malt Spi∣rits
at Home, which, as to the common
Consumption, is turned all into the meanest
of Liquor; but however, 'tis such as the
People eagerly close with, and by that
the Importation of Brandy is certainly re∣duced
from nine thousand Ton to less than
two thousand Ton a Year.</P>
<P>ALL the rest of the <HI>French</HI> Goods, which
were formerly imported from thence, so
much to our Loss, being now made at Home,
I hope no Man can be so weak as to call that
a Declining or Decrease of our Trade; on
the contrary, 'tis a happy Encrease of it,
for that the Consumption is at least the
same, and our own People have the Pro∣fit
of the Making; the Consumption is the
same among the rich, and our own Poor
take the Money instead of the Poor of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the <HI>French</HI> Wine Trade, the Que∣stion
answers it self, the Stream only is tur∣ned
from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Quantity
of Wine consumed is not the less; and as it
is farther to fetch, the Shipping is rather
encreas'd by it than abated; the Ships not
being able to make so many Voyages as they
did before, there must be the more Bot∣toms,
or the more Tonnage in larger Ships
employ'd, and either of them are an Encrease
to the Navigation.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="305"/>
AS to the Fishing Trade being decreased,
it is begging the Question in a notorious
Manner, and I think needs no Answering.
On the contrary we see it lately encreased
by a very great and probable Undertaking
of the <HI>Greenland</HI> Fishery; we see also seve∣ral
Proposals on foot for farther encreasing
the <HI>Scots</HI> Fishery, and our other Fishing
must be necessarily encreased by the Addi∣tion
of our Dominion in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI>
by the late Peace, where our Room for en∣creasing
the Fishing is greatly enlarged.
And it cannot be deny'd, but that the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Fishing on the Banks also is actual∣ly
encreased: We must therefore be allow'd
to say that Part needs no Reply till the
Fact be prov'd.</P>
<P>LET us next enquire what one particular
Trade in all our Foreign Business is impair'd,
what Goods of Foreign Growth are they
which lye by us unsold, and with which our
Markets are glutted, or which our Merchants
give no more Commissions for, being not
able to consume them at Home, or export
them to other Places Abroad.</P>
<P>I shall be very brief in the Inquiry.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>East India</HI> Company;
their Trade has been crampt by Prohibiti∣ons
at Home, and by new Invasions from
Abroad; their Silks and Callicoes forbidden
to be worn, in Favour of Rival Manu∣factures
of Linen and Silk; their Commerce
invaded by a Rival Company at <HI>Ostend;</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="306"/>
yet we see last their Sale amounted to almost
eleven Hundred Thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI>
which allowing it to be half yearly, as re∣ally
is the Case, can very ill be called a
sinking Commerce.</P>
<P>TAKE our Plantation Trade, the Island
of St. <HI>Christopher</HI>'s being, our own by the
late Peace, we see improv'd and increas'd to
such a Degree, that the Return of Sugar,
Ginger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is now as great from thence as
from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and the Plantations in
<HI>Jamaica</HI> are so evidently encreas'd, that
we are told in a few Years they will raise
ten Thousand Hogsheads of Sugar and
Cocao more than ever they did before.</P>
<P>IN a Word, whereas formerly we had a
Glut of Sugar from our Colonies, and
were distress'd for a Market to dispose of
the Overplus, 'tis now evident, that since
the great encreas'd Consumption of Coffee
and Tea in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> all our Colo∣nies
are hardly able to supply the Consump∣tion;
and from Thirty Thousand Hogsheads
of Sugar which formerly we imported, 'tis
certain we now import from seventy to eigh∣ty
Thousand Hogsheads in a Year, from
all our Colonies, not reckoning the ex∣travagant
Bulk of the Hogsheads, which
now generally contain from seventeen
to eighteen hundred Weight of Sugar in
each Hogshead, one with another, some
of them much more.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="307"/>
IN like Manner, the Plantations in <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI>
and <HI>Maryland</HI> are encreased to such
a Magnitude, that I am told they produce
now from eighty to an Hundred Thousand
Hogsheads every Year; a Quantity so great,
Compar'd to what has formerly been pro∣duced,
that if it be all disposed of, no Man
can say the <HI>Virginia</HI> Trade is not infinitely
increased; besides the great Export of Pro∣visions
from <HI>Virginia,</HI> that is to say, from
<HI>Cheseapeak</HI> Bay, which they send to our
Island Colonies, more by some Hundreds
of Sloops Loading a Year, than ever they
sent before, which is one great Cause of
the <HI>Virginia</HI> Planters falling lately into the
Trade of buying Negroes from the Coast
of <HI>Africa,</HI> which they never used to do
formerly.</P>
<P>AS our Island Colonies are thus mightily
increas'd and improved, as it is most certain
they are; their People encreasing, they
necessarily demand a much greater Supply
of Provisions from our other Colonies on
the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> than they had
before; and this encreases the Trade of
those Colonies, such as of <HI>New-England,
New-York, New-Jersey,</HI> East and West;
<HI>Pensilvania, Carolina,</HI> as also the Trade
from the <HI>Canaries, Maderas,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Cape de
Verd</HI> Islands for Salt, and the Coast of <HI>Gui∣nea</HI>
for <HI>Negroes:</HI> So that here is a mani∣fest
Encrease of all the Commerce of both
the East and West <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="308"/>
WHERE then shall we find a Decay?
where is there a Stagnation, what Trade
languishes, and where is it that we drive
less Business than we did before?</P>
<P><HI>Portugal</HI> will not pretend to it; I might
say the whole World is Witness to the ma∣nifest
Encrease of our Trade with the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI>
who alone 'tis plain take off more
of our Woollen Manufacture, since the late
Encrease of their Commerce to <HI>Brasil,</HI> than
both the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
used to do before: So that our Trade to
those Parts is extremely improv'd.</P>
<P>'TIS true, there may be some casual A∣batements
of our Exportation to some par∣ticular
Parts of the World, and especially as
Things stand at this Time, by the War,
or by the unsettled Circumstances of the Na∣tions,
with respect to Continuance of Peace
or War; yet nothing can be argued upon
that Supposition, but what all Trades, and
all trading Nations are subject to, and ever
will be on the like Occasions.</P>
<P>LET us next view the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Le∣vant</HI>
Trades, which are very great Articles,
and which bear a considerable Part in the
great Balance of our general Commerce; the
Turky Merchants have indeed complain'd,
but what is the Complaint? If the just
Part be examin'd, it will appear to lye here,
<HI>and here only;</HI> not that the Goods they car∣ry
Abroad want a Market, but that the
Silk they have brought Home, has, from
<PB N="277" REF="309"/>
whatever Neglect we yet know not, abated
In its usual Fineness and Goodness; and that
to such a Degree, that the Manufacturers
here, that is the Weavers, could no longer
make use of it, at least not in such Works,
and to such Purposes as they had formerly
done; and so the Trade may have suffer'd,
not from the Abatement of the Market
Abroad or at Home, but from the Mer∣chants
not taking Care to import a good
Commodity.</P>
<P>THIS can no more be call'd a Decay or
Loss of the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade, than it would
be a Loss of the Trade now carried on by
the South Sea Company to <HI>America;</HI> if
the Returns for their Goods should be made
in a false Coin, or in counterfeit Pieces of
Eight in stead of the true; The Trade there∣fore
is not sunk; for if the Weavers cannot
use the <HI>Turkey</HI> Silk, because it is deficient
in Quality, they must use other Sorts; that
is to say, fine <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Piedmont</HI> thrown
Silks, or <HI>Bengale</HI> raw Silk in the Room of it,
and 'tis certain they do so. And it is worth
while to observe on this Occasion, how far
this has been the Case, and how the Impor∣tation
of those Silks has encreased, as the
other has prov'd inferior; so that the Silk
Trade has not been lessen'd at all.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It was alledg'd in the late Dispute
between the <HI>Throwsters</HI> and the Wea∣vers
before the House of Commons,
that as the <HI>Turkey</HI> Silks were brought
<PB N="278" REF="310"/>
over worse than formerly; so the <HI>East
India</HI> or <HI>Bengale</HI> Silks came better
than ever, and accordingly were more
in Demand: For it will for ever be
true, that whatever Materials of a Ma∣nufacture
are furnish'd from Abroad,
and decay in Goodness, they will de∣cay
in the Use, sink in Price, and at
length sink out of Demand, or they
will make the Manufacture they are
employ'd in sink in its Value, which is
still worse.</P>
<P>WHERE then shall we look for a Decay of
our Importations? if to the Navy, that is
already answered in the Discourse of the
Shipping: If the Number of Ships employ'd
is not abated, as I believe our worst Enemies
will not suggest, then our Commerce to the
East Country cannot be abated; by our East
Country Trade, is always understood our
Trade in Hemp, Flax, Tar, Pitch, Iron,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> That is to say in general, Naval Stores;
Now, 'tis manifest by the Custom-house
Books (to which I refer) that these are not
abated; but on the contrary, very much
encreased, notwithstanding our great Im∣portation
of Tar, Oyl, Masts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
our own Colonies.</P>
<P>IN what Part of the World then is our
Trade decay'd, and in what Branch of our
Business does it lye? for those People than
insist upon the Decay of our Trade, and
that make such loud Complaints about it,
<PB N="279" REF="311"/>
ought to let us know they do not raise
groundless Complaints, that would be call'd
Clamour and Disaffection, and would look
like something particularly piquant, which
I am loth to suggest.</P>
<P>I must therefore call upon them for their
Explanations, and to let us see the Place
where our Trade is decay'd, and what
Goods they are, the Consumption of which
is lessen'd and decay'd either at Home or
Abroad; with such needful Descriptions of
Trade in general, as may convince us there
is no equivalent Encrease in other Branches
to make it up, and to balance the Abate∣ment.</P>
<P>THE immediate Reply to this, is what
I have mention'd already, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The mi∣micking
our Woollen Manufacture in seve∣ral
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> by which the De∣mand
of those Manufactures from <HI>England</HI>
is abated, and may in Time be laid aside in
those particular Countries, such as our
Bays, Flannels, Chamlets, Says, and seve∣ral
other kinds of Goods.</P>
<P>BUT what does this amount to in the
general Article of our great Manufacture?
let particular Cases be what they will, let
<HI>Saxony, Swisserland, Piedmont, Austria,</HI>
and Twenty more Places, if you could
name them, interfere with, supplant or pro∣hibit
this or that Manufacture, and make
a visible Decrease of the Consumption here
or there: If the Consumption is encreas'd
<PB N="280" REF="312"/>
in other Parts of the World, be it a Thou∣sand
Miles, or Ten thousand Miles from
<HI>Germany,</HI> the thing is answered, the Ma∣nufacture
is the same.</P>
<P>THE Question lies nearer Home, the En∣quiry,
like the searching for a Disease, is in the
vital Part; the Search is at the Heart, if the
Pulse of the Trade beats true and strong,
the Body is sound, Wind and Limb; is in a
State of Health, and flourishing in spight
of all the little Casualties that may happen
in other remote Parts.</P>
<P>THE Question in the Manufacture has
no difficulty at all in it; and yet it seems
that those Gentlemen who insist upon the
Decay of the Manufacture do it upon the
Presumption, that there is no coming at the
Negative; but I shall put it upon a Cer∣tainty
which perhaps they may not foresee.
The Question is in few Words (as before) Is
the Quantity of Wooll wrought up, or is it
not? If all our Wooll is wrought up, nay
if it is not sufficient for the Manufacture,
then the Manufacture cannot be declined.</P>
<P>IT is within these Five and twenty Years,
that we found the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> lye on
Hand unsold, and the Farmers in the Sheep-feeding
Countries, such as <HI>Northampton,
Leicester, Lincoln, Warwick, Norfolk,</HI>
and many other Places, had generally two
or three Years Wooll upon their Hands
unsold, and the Price low, and very little
Demand for it.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="313"/>
BUT now, and especially since the seve∣ral
Acts prohibiting the <HI>East India</HI> Silks,
Callicoes, Chints, and other Goods of
that Kind, we find the <HI>English</HI> Wooll not
only all used up at Home, but also the
<HI>Irish</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll brought over in
unusual Quantities to help; and yet the Price
holds up, and there is no Glut of Wooll in
the whole Island; how then can the Manu∣facture
be declin'd? unless you will first
make it appear, that the Quantity of Wooll
is abated in <HI>England,</HI> which I believe will
not be pretended, and if it were, would
be hard to prove.</P>
<P>I might very profitably employ a whole
Chapter here to prove to you, that the
Quantity of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> is so far
from being lessen'd and decreased, that it
is greatly encreased for many Years past,
and continues every Year to encrease: I
could prove it by proving the Encrease of
the Number of Sheep in <HI>England;</HI> and the
Encrease of Sheep would be prov'd past
Contradiction, by the Improvement of Cul∣ture,
the enclosing vast Tracts of Land in
almost all Parts of <HI>England</HI> which lay open
before; and which being now improved
either by the Plowman, or by the Grazier,
still occasions greater flocks of Sheep, and
those of the best and largest Kind, to be
sed than were before.</P>
<P>I could add to it the vast Improvement
made on the North-west and Eastern Coasts
<PB N="282" REF="314"/>
of <HI>England,</HI> as also on the Coasts of <HI>Wales,</HI>
by saving and draining Lands from the Sea,
and from the Rivers, by which multitudes
of Sheep are fed, as they are in <HI>Rumney</HI>
Marshes mention'd above: The almost in∣credible
Improvement of Land in the Coun∣tries
of <HI>Cumberland, Durham</HI> and <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI>
by which the Number of
Sheep are encreased on that Side the Coun∣try
in a Manner, I say, hardly to be be∣lieved.</P>
<P>I might also speak of the improv'd Me∣thods,
even in the breeding and feeding of
Sheep, by raising them upon the plow'd and
fallow Lands, upon Salt Marshes, and other
Grounds, such as were never known by our
Ancestors to feed Sheep before. And,
<HI>lastly,</HI> I might insist upon an Article little
considered, but which is really of more
Importance as to the Encrease of Wooll
than all the rest, <HI>Namely,</HI> that the Nation
is universally fallen into a way of breeding
larger Sheep than they did before: So that
not only the Numbers of Sheep are encrea∣sed
by many Thousands of Acres being em∣ploy'd
to feed and breed, which never fed
a Sheep before; but even the Sheep them∣selves
are of a different Kind, and two
Sheep produce more Wooll than three
Sheep, and in some Places, than four Sheep
did before. To bring this into Evidence,
we need do no more than appeal to the mean∣est
of the Country People in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="315"/>
and <HI>Leicestershire;</HI> in the first you will see
the feeding and breeding of large Sheep
spread from the Country of <HI>Lincoln</HI> only,
to which formerly it was confin'd, into all
the level Grounds, Marshes and Fens of
<HI>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Hunting∣ton;</HI>
from the County of <HI>Leicester</HI> the
same Breed of Sheep is spread into the
Counties of <HI>Warwick, Stafford</HI> and <HI>North∣ampton,</HI>
and even the smaller Breeds of
those Counties, which they now call
Stubble Sheep, and which feed on the fal∣low
and common Fields, are of a larger
kind than ever before.</P>
<P>TO look into the North, we see the Im∣provement
in the Countries of <HI>Durham</HI>
and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> running all into a
large Breed of Sheep; and you may buy as
large Mutton at the Markets in the City of
<HI>Durham,</HI> as any you can buy at <HI>Leaden∣hall;</HI>
I affirm it, and dare bring it to a
Proof on any just Occasion; and we see
large <HI>Northumberland</HI> Sheep brought up
yearly for Sale in great Droves into all
these Southern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> especially
into <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>IF then there were no Encrease in the
Numbers of our Sheep, the contrary of
which is true to a Demonstration; yet if
we run into a larger Breed, the Wooll may
still be encreased as much as if the Numbers
were encreased; but as it is apparent that
both the Breed is altered, and the Genera∣lity
<PB N="284" REF="316"/>
of the Sheep-breeders run into another
larger Kind, and the Numbers of Sheep by
the Encrease of Culture and Enclosure is
encreased also. How then can we pretend
the Quantity of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> is de∣clin'd?
The Weight of this Part of the
Argument may be sum'd up thus.</P>
<P>IF the Numbers of Sheep are not de∣creased,
nor the Breed of the Sheep dege∣nerated,
then the Quantity of our Wooll
cannot be decreased or abated.</P>
<P>IF the Quantity of Wooll is not abated,
and yet it does not lye on hand, and want a
Market, then the whole Growth of our
Wooll is evidently used up and manufa∣ctured;
for it would not be bought if it
could not be used.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take it in the Reverse.</P>
<P>IF our whole Growth of Wooll is not
only bought and used up, but that we buy
great Quantities of Wooll and Woollen
Yarn from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to such a Degree, as has
been said, that it amounts to an hundred
thousand Packs a Year: Then 'tis evident
that the whole Growth of our Wooll is not
equal to our Manufacture.</P>
<P>IF it is true, that our whole Growth of
Wooll is not equal to our Manufacture;
that is to say, that it is not sufficient for
our Supply; but that greater Quantities than
ever are brought in every Year from <HI>Ire∣land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> all of which (clandestine
Trade excepted) is used up, and manufa∣ctured
<PB N="285" REF="317"/>
in this Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called
<HI>England,</HI> as has been proved: Then the
Manufacture of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> cannot
be lessen'd or decay'd; but on the contrary,
is evidently improv'd and encreas'd.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As to the Exception for clande∣stine
Trade; it is mentioned indeed to
anticipate any Cavil which might be
raised upon the Omission, as if we did
not know there was such a Trade as
owling or running of Wooll carried on
among us; but the Quantity so carried
off, tho' too much, with Respect to
the Injury done our Trade, yet is
small, and indeed not worth naming,
in comparison of the Bulk of Wooll,
which the Growth of the whole King∣dom
produces, and of which we are
now speaking.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Enquiry whether the Exportation
of our other Goods, the Growth
or Manufacture of England, or
the Home Consumption of them is
decreased or declined.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE mentioned the Produce of
our Colonies, and prov'd that
they are evidently encreased, as
well in their Exports to one ano∣ther,
as in the Consumption and Re-expor∣tation
of their Produce here in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I have mentioned the Encrease of our
Woollen Manufacture, and prov'd it to a
Demonstration by the Consumption of the
Wooll.</P>
<P>IT seems only to remain, that we should
enquire into some other Trades which are
profitably carry'd on among us, and see
whether they are not declin'd in Proporti∣on,
and to make way for the Encrease of
the Woollen Manufacture; for if other
Branches of Commerce are declin'd in Pro∣portion,
the Woollen Manufacture, how∣ever
<PB N="287" REF="319"/>
great, may be encreased, and yet our
Trade in general be declin'd too, and at the
same Time.</P>
<P>BUT I persuade my self, It will be hard
to find any part of the Product of <HI>England</HI>
which can be said to be declin'd and de∣creased,
either in its Exportation to Coun∣tries
Abroad, or in its Consumption at
Home.</P>
<P>THE Product of <HI>England</HI> has been alrea∣dy
at large describ'd, the Wooll is set in
the Front as the Chief, and it is so; but it
is not the only Product, nor are the Wool∣len
Manufactures the only things which
employ the People of <HI>England,</HI> and set their
Hands to Work; there are several Manu∣factures
in <HI>England</HI> which employ a vast
Number of People in which the Wooll is
no way concern'd, and upon Examination,
we shall find, (1.) some of these are wholly
now a mere modern Improvement, and on
which no Hands were set to Work, no
Stock employ'd before.</P>
<P>2. OTHERS, tho' known before, are
yet exceedingly improv'd and encreas'd,
and consequently employ many Hands which
were unemploy'd before, which in short
is the essential Part of all Improvement
in Trade.</P>
<P>I shall give Examples of some of those
Manufactures, which are more remarkable
than others, and by which the most consi∣derable
Number of Poor are employ'd,
<PB N="288" REF="320"/>
and Materials consum'd; for the rest, it
shall suffice only to name them.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Bone Lace</HI> Manufacture. It is
true, that there was always, perhaps, for
some Ages past, a Manufacture of <HI>Bone
Lace</HI> carry'd on in <HI>England;</HI> but the Im∣provement
and Encrease of it within about
20 to 30 Years past is such, and so visible,
that he must be utterly ignorant of Trade
that is not convinc'd of it. In former
Times, the chief Place for this Manufacture
was about <HI>Buckingham, Stony Stratford,</HI>
and <HI>Newport Pagnaell,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Newport
Pannel;</HI> you have it now spread, almost
entirely over the Counties of <HI>Buckingham,
Bedford</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> and far into the Coun∣ties
of <HI>Berks, Northampton, Cambridge,
Hertford</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> especially where any
or all those Counties border on the first;
It is also erected in the West, and especially
in the Counties of <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire,</HI>
where particularly at <HI>Blandford</HI> they make
Lace of an exceeding high Price, and not
outdone, <HI>Brussels</HI> Lace excepted, by any
out of <HI>Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders, France,</HI> or even <HI>Venice</HI> it
self. In a word, this Manufacture is so
much encreased in <HI>England,</HI> that it employs
many Thousands of our People more than
ever; and if I may credit the Report of
the Country where 'tis chiefly made, where
one was employ'd by it 30 Years ago, above
100 are employ'd by it now, and these of
the most idle, useless and burthensome Part
<PB N="289" REF="321"/>
of our People (I mean such as were so be∣fore)
are the principal Hands employ'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> the younger Women, and female Chil∣dren.
These were a real Charge upon the
diligent laborious Poor, such as the Hus∣band-men,
the Farmers, and the Handi∣crafts
of other Trades; and are now made
able to provide for themselves, and ease
their Parents and Parishes of a dead Weight,
which was in many Cases insupportable;
but I cannot dwell upon the Particulars,
which otherwise would be profitably enqui∣red
into. In short, 'tis believ'd there are
above an Hundred Thousand Women and
Children employ'd, and who get their Bread
by this Manufacture, more than did for∣merly;
for 'tis the Encrease of It that I am
now discoursing of; and this Encrease has
an Effect upon the general Commerce of
this Kingdom, very much to the Advantage
of <HI>England,</HI> for Example.</P>
<P>1. IN employing all this great Number
of People in a Manufacture which em∣ploy'd,
as may be reasonably suppos'd, the
like Number of People in another Country,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>Flanders:</HI> so that it may be said
to be taking the Bread out of the Poor of
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and putting it into the Mouths
of the Poor of our own Country.</P>
<P>2. IT is a Turn in the Balance of Trade
to the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> in supplying
us with the same Quantity of Goods by the
Labour of our own Poor, which we, till
<PB N="290" REF="322"/>
now, bought abroad, and which buying
abroad, was always attended with this as a
Consequence, that either we paid for them
in Money, or in our own Manufactures;
whereas (if the first) that Money, is now
kept at Home; and (if the last) those Ma∣nufactures
must be paid for to us in Money,
as they certainly are.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER encreas'd Manufacture is
that of wrought Iron and Brass: I need
not refer to the Towns of <HI>Birmingham</HI> and
<HI>Sheffield,</HI> and the People of <HI>Hallamshire,</HI>
a District well known to the Nailers and
hard Ware Men of <HI>Barnsely</HI> and <HI>Rother∣ham:</HI>
But I appeal to the Iron Works of the
late Sir <HI>Ambrose Crowley,</HI> and his Son Al∣derman
<HI>Crowley,</HI> at <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI>
and above all, to the same sort employ'd in
<HI>London,</HI> where they certainly make the
best Cutlery Ware at this Time in the
World.</P>
<P>IT is not many Years since the best
Scissars, the best Knives, and the best Ra∣zors
were made in <HI>France,</HI> and the like of
the fine Watches, Tweezars, and other
small Ware; nothing is more evident in
Trade at this Time, than that the best
Knife Blades, Scissars, Surgeons Instruments,
Watches, Clocks, Jacks and Locks that are
in the World, and especially Toys and gay
Things are made in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>London</HI>
in particular; and our Custom-house Books,
will make it appear, that we send daily great
<PB N="291" REF="323"/>
Quantities of wrought Iron and Brass into
<HI>Holland, France, Italy, Venice,</HI> and to all
Parts of <HI>Germany, Poland</HI> and <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, no particular Manufacture
can be nam'd, which has encreased like this
of the hard Ware, I mean, in <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI>
and 'tis still an encreasing Manufa∣cture:
To make Calculations, and Compari∣sons,
seems to be piquant in the Case, and
particularly pointed at this or that Nation;
but let it point where it will, the Fact is
plain; 'tis the like in the grosser Part of the
Trades, as our Toys, Scissars, Razors, Knife
and Sword Blades outdo the <HI>French;</HI> so
our common Bombs, Shells, Grenades, Cal∣drons,
and all sorts of cast Iron, as much
outdo the <HI>Germans,</HI> the <HI>Legois,</HI> or the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the like in wrought Brass; most of the
Brass Locks of all the fine Palaces in <HI>France,</HI>
if narrowly inspected, will be found to be
<HI>English;</HI> the fine Gold Watches in the
Pockets of the Grand Seignior, the Czar
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the Sophy of <HI>Persia,</HI> or
the great Mogul, are generally <HI>English:</HI>
We send our Toys to the Court of <HI>France,</HI>
and the <HI>English</HI> Knives and Razors have
quite outdone the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>BY this Means it comes to pass, as I am
well assur'd, that there are above 200000
People employ'd in the Manufacture of
Iron and Brass in <HI>England,</HI> more than ever
were before: Perhaps this may be of the
<PB N="292" REF="324"/>
most as to Numbers, nor will I take that
Part upon my self, tho', if it be true,
that the late Sir <HI>Ambrose Crawley</HI> did em∣ploy
30000 People in his own particular
Part, the rest may be more than probable.
But this, upon the whole, will (I doubt
not) be allow'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that there is a visible
Encrease of our Trade in Iron and Brass, as
well as it is a Manufacture, as it is a Mer∣chandice;
for there is a manifest Encrease
of the Exportation and Home Consumpti∣on,
as well as an Encrease of Employment
for the People.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> IN this Article should be included
the Mines of Copper lately improv'd
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> as also the
<HI>Battery</HI> and <HI>Brass Mills</HI> and <HI>Founda∣ries,</HI>
which are in themselves very
considerable; and if we may credit the
Representations made to the Parlia∣ment
a few Years since, do employ
many Thousands of our People more
than were ever employ'd in those
things before.</P>
<P>THESE are Improvements in Manufa∣cture
and Trade; and as they testify an En∣crease
of Trade, we can see no Room yet
to suggest that the Trade of <HI>England</HI> in
general is declin'd or decay'd.</P>
<P>3. THERE are some other Articles yet
more considerable than these, and one of
them is the broad Silk Manufacture; I can∣not
pass it over; it is an Encrease of this
<PB N="293" REF="325"/>
very Age. It is a Surprise to the World, as
well in its Quantity as in its Value, and in the
admirable Perfection which our People are
arriv'd to in it, and the little Time they
have had to raise it to the Degree which it
is arriy'd to.</P>
<P>IT is but a very few Years ago, that the
making of broad Silks bega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>England;</HI>
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Italians</HI> carried the
World before them (as to Trade) in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> par∣ticular
Article; what Attempts had been
made in <HI>England</HI> were chiefly at <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
by the <HI>Walloons</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugees,
and they were so beaten out by the <HI>East
India</HI> Silks, that if I am not misinform'd,
there were not 20 Looms left at Work in
the whole City of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> some say, not
half so many.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>French</HI> Trade prevail'd, and
before the Stop of Commerce between the
two Kingdoms began by the late War, the
most moderate Calculations valued the
broad Silks which were imported from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Itally</HI> at 1200000 Pounds <HI>Ster∣ling
per Annum;</HI> some say, we took off as
much as that Value in the <HI>French</HI> Silks
only, whereof one Half at least in <HI>Alamodes</HI>
and <HI>Lustrings,</HI> the Manufacture of <HI>Lyons,</HI>
and the Provinces upon the <HI>Rhosne.</HI></P>
<P>BUT be it so or not; for we are not adjust∣ing
the Value of Things, in that or any other
Part of that Country, but the general Tide
or Current of the whole Trade; of which I
<PB N="294" REF="326"/>
might venture to say, it was known to the
whole World, that is to the whole trading
World, that it run to the Advantage of
<HI>France,</HI> with a full Stream directly from <HI>En∣gland;</HI>
I mean as to the Silk Manufacture,
all which Trade is now sunk, I say, sunk
and lost as to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> to the in∣finite
Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> and this not
that <HI>England</HI> may be said to leave off wear∣ing
Silk: No, far from it; as our Wealth
is encreased, we do not pretend our Pride
or Vanity is abated; our Ladies go as gay,
and our Houses are furnish'd as rich as ever,
and perhaps more so, and in the same
Kinds and sorts of Silks, Lustrings, Man∣tuas,
Velvets, <HI>Padua</HI> Soys, Garden Sattins,
the best and richest Brocades, and the best
and richest of all sorts of Silks: But the
Difference lies here, that whereas we bought
them before, now we make them at Home;
we set the <HI>French</HI> Men of <HI>Tours,</HI> of
<HI>Lyons, Avignon,</HI> and the Countries about
them at Work before, and the <HI>Italians</HI> of
<HI>Milan, Mantua Genoa, Florence</HI> and
<HI>Naples,</HI> and paid them all at a vast Expence
of <HI>English</HI> Money, a Profusion of Money,
even a Million 200000 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> a Year;
whereas now our own Poor gain all that
Money; our own Merchants import the
Materials, our own Manufacture purchases
the Silk, the Drugs and Dye Stuffs; and
the whole Manufacture of broad Silk is
an Encrease upon our Commerce. But I
<PB N="295" REF="327"/>
shall say no more of this here, because I
shall have Occasion to mention it again,
when I come to speak of the <HI>English</HI> People
improving upon the Manufacture and In∣ventions
of other Nations.</P>
<P>4. I proceed therefore to another visible
Encrease of Trade, which spreads daily
among us, and affects not <HI>England</HI> only,
but <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> also, tho' the
Consumption depends wholly upon <HI>En∣gland;</HI>
and this is printing or painting of
Linen. The late Acts of prohibiting the
Use and wearing of painted Callicoes, ei∣ther
in Cloths, Equipages or House Furni∣niture,
was without Question aim'd at im∣proving
the Consumption of our Woollen
Manufacture, and in Part it had an Effect
that way.</P>
<P>BUT the Humour of the People running
another way, and being used to, and pleased
with the light, easie and gay Dress of the
Callicoes, the Callicoe Printers fell to
Work to imitate those Callicoes, by making
the same Stamps and Impressions, and with
the same Beauty of Colours upon the
Linen, and that this fell upon the two par∣ticular
Branches of Linen, call'd <HI>Scots</HI>
Cloth and <HI>Irish</HI> Linen: I need not take
any Pains to prove this. The Consequence is
also evident, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Linen Manu∣facture
both in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Ireland</HI> are
considerably encreas'd upon that Occasion,
and many hundred thousand Ells of Linen
<PB N="296" REF="328"/>
are yearly imported from <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
and printed in <HI>England,</HI> more than ever
were before; so that this is an Article whol∣ly
new in Trade, and indeed the Printing
it self is wholly new; for it is but a few
Years ago since no such thing as painting
or printing of Linen or Callicoe was known
in <HI>England;</HI> all being supply'd so cheap, and
perform'd so very fine from <HI>India,</HI> that no∣thing
but a Prohibition of the foreign printed
Callicoes could raise it up to a Manufacture
at Home; whereas now it is so encreased,
that the Parliament has thought it of Mag∣nitude
sufficient to lay a Tax upon it, and a
considerable Revenue is raised by it.</P>
<P>IT may be enquired here concerning the
great Numbers of People employ'd in these
Improvements, what were they employ'd
in before? and how do we call it an Im∣provement,
if they are only taken from one
Manufacture into another.</P>
<P>THIS might be fully answered, if we had
Room here to enquire critically in the seve∣ral
Counties where those particular Im∣provements
are made; we should there find,
that in almost all the Improvements and En∣crease
of Business above mentioned, such as
the Manufactures of Bone Lace, the Brass
and Iron Manufactures, the Haberdashery;
and in a Word, all the other improv'd
Manufactures, except that of Broad Silk
weaving, the People employ'd were not at
all employ'd in the Woollen Manufactures
<PB N="297" REF="329"/>
before, but were, generally speaking, out
of Business, idle and unemploy'd, there be∣ing
no such thing as Woollen Manufactures
settled in the Counties and Towns where
those Improvements have been made, such
as <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> and <HI>Bedfordshire Shef∣field,
Birmingham,</HI> and <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon
<HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>THE broad Silk Trade indeed, being
chiefly carried on in the Cities of <HI>London,</HI>
might be said to employ some of the Peo∣ple
formerly employ'd in the Woollen Ma∣nufacture
in the same Place, (<HI>viz.) Spittle-Fields:</HI>
But then it must be added, that
even that Encroachment was only upon
the Abatement of such Woollen Goods in
that Place, which were imprudently launch∣ed
out into before, upon the foolish Ex∣pectation
of a great Encrease of the Wool∣len
Trade, by the Prohibitions of <HI>East In∣dia</HI>
Goods; so that even in this Part the
Silk Trade has very little, if at all en∣croach'd
upon the Woollen, tho', if it had,
the Exchange had very little alter'd the
Case.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, after the narrowest
Search, and with the utmost Imparti∣ality,
I cannot see that we have any Room
to say our Trade is decreas'd, whether we
speak of our Woollen or other Manufactures;
whether of Goods imported or exported;
whether of the Home Consumption, or the
<PB N="298" REF="330"/>
Consumption of our Growth Abroad. On
the contrary, we have great Reason to in∣sist,
that our whole Trade is encreased to a
very great Degree; it remains only in a sum∣mary
Way, to account for the Encrease
of our Commerce both Abroad and at
Home.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Improvement of the English
in Trade; upon the Inventions of other
Nations; and the Encrease of our Com∣merce
upon those Improvements; in
which we have beaten out the said In∣ventors
from their own Trade; likewise
of the several Improvements of our own
Product, and of our own Invention: By
all which our Trade is greatly encreased.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a Kind of Proverb attending
the Character of <HI>English</HI> Men,
That they are <HI>better to improve
than to invent,</HI> better to advance
upon the Designs and Plans which other
People have laid down, than to form
Schemes and Designs of their own; and
which is still more, the Thing seems to be
really true in Fact, and the Observation
very just.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="332"/>
WHETHER this Reproach upon them is
raised upon the Suggestions of Foreign Ob∣servers,
or whether it be our own upon
our selves, is not worth while to examine; it
seems we are very willing to grant the Fact.</P>
<P>UPON this Supposition then my Subject
seems to be adapted to the national Tem∣per;
I offer here a Scene of Originals, for
the improving Genius of our People to
work upon a Stock of Invention for them
to improve upon: May they take the Hint,
try their Hands, and go to Work upon
them with the usual Success.</P>
<P>HENCE most of our great Advances in
Arts, in Trade, in Government, and in
almost all the great Things, we are now
Masters of, and in which we so much exceed
all our Neighbouring Nations, are really
founded upon the Inventions of others;
whether those first Inventers were private
Men, or Nations of Men, 'tis not material.</P>
<P>EVEN our Woollen Manufacture it self,
with all the admirable Improvements made
upon it by the <HI>English,</HI> since it came
into their Hands, is but a building upon
other Mens Foundations, and improving
on the Inventions of the <HI>Flemings:</HI> The
Wooll indeed was <HI>English,</HI> but the Wit
was all <HI>Flemish;</HI> we had the Materials,
but no more understood the Virtue of them,
than the World understood the Making
Gun-powder, tho' they had always the
Sulphur and Salts, which are now the
<PB N="301" REF="333"/>
proper Ingredients of that dreadful Com∣position.</P>
<P>WE had the Wool, but understood
neither how to comb it or card it, spin it
or weave it; nay, we cannot be said to
know, that it was capable of those manu∣al
Operations, or what Spinning and Wea∣ving
was, any more than if we had not
known what the Wool was: But when, <HI>as
has been observ'd,</HI> by the Direction of King
<HI>Henry</HI> VII. the <HI>English</HI> were put upon the
general Notion of Improvement, inform'd
of the Profit of manufacturing it, and but
once directed how to go about it, by the
<HI>Flemish</HI> Agents hir'd to instruct them:
How soon did they outdo their Teachers,
and to what a Pitch of Improvement did
they rise in a few Years? Till now we see
the World ambitious of imitating us in
the same Manner, and to rival our Manu∣factures,
are obliged to hire Instructers
from hence, and to learn of those who were
themselves but Learners before.</P>
<P>I might enter into almost all the Im∣provements
of Art in which the <HI>English</HI>
so much now excel the rest of the World:
How in several Manufactures we have
turn'd the Scale of Trade, and send our
Goods to be sold in those very Countries
from whence we deriv'd the Knowledge
and Art of making them.</P>
<P>THUS we were all said to learn the
Art of building Ships from the <HI>Genoese</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="334"/>
and <HI>French,</HI> and at this Day so effectually
outbuild them all, that the <HI>Genoese</HI> often
buy Ships in <HI>England,</HI> and the late King of
<HI>France,</HI> the great <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. procured
the Model of our Ships from <HI>England,</HI> by
which to build his Capital Men of War;
among which that glorious Ship burnt by
<HI>English</HI> at <HI>La Hogue,</HI> called the <HI>Royal
Sun,</HI> was said to be built by the Model of
the <HI>Royal Sovereign,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man of
War, built in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
first, and rebuilt in King <HI>Charles</HI> the se∣cond's
Time, and the Drafts of it were it
seems transmitted to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> we
took the Art of <HI>Glass-Making,</HI> and of
<HI>Cutlery,</HI> and several others; till now we
outdo our Teachers, and export Glass
Wares, Brass Locks, Fine Keys, Knives,
Scissars, Razors, Surgeons Instruments, and
Joyners Tools, to those very Places; and
you may see the Doors of the Royal
Apartments at <HI>Versailles,</HI> (as is said above)
furnish'd with fine Brass Locks and nice
Hinges from <HI>England,</HI> because <HI>France</HI> can∣not
produce the like.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of the like Kind
in many other Cases, wherein we excel in
the Improvement those very People, who
so much excell'd us in the Invention; of
which the Silk Manufacture is now a sur∣prising
Example, in which we so much out∣do
the <HI>French</HI> themselves, who were our
<PB N="303" REF="335"/>
Teachers, and of whom we always bought
the richest and finest broad Silks the whole
World could produce, that we now sell
broad Silks even into <HI>France</HI> it self.</P>
<P>TO begin with probable Improvements
in Colonies and Plantations; <HI>Columbus</HI> a
<HI>Genoese</HI> by Nation, discover'd the Coasts
of <HI>America,</HI> and his Successors the Adven∣turers
upon those Discoveries, took Pos∣session
for the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> It is true,
they spread themselves upon the Continent,
reduc'd, or rather destroy'd the Nations
who inhabited the several Countries, pos∣sess'd
the immense Wealth of the Natives,
and being led by the Hand to the Mines
of Gold and Silver, and the other rich Pro∣duct
of the Place, they vouchsafed, as we
may say, to stoop and take it up; but we
can charge them with very little of Im∣provement:
The Sin of Diligence cannot
be lay'd at their Door, nor have they to
this Day, after almost 200 Years peaceable
Possession, brought the most fruitful and
richest Provinces and Districts of <HI>America</HI>
to be much more productive than they
were before; not a Manufacture of any
Value erected to employ and improve the
People; not any Advantage considerable
made of the Labour of the many Thou∣sands
of the Natives, who still remain
among them, and are as willing as able to
work for them for a Trifle; not any Cul∣ture
carried on, no not in the most fruitful
<PB N="304" REF="336"/>
Provinces, to encrease the Product equal to
the Strength of the Soil.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the <HI>English</HI> tho' plant∣ing
near 100 Years after them, and taking,
as it might be called, the Fag-end of the
Discovery, the northern, cold, and barren
Parts, without Silver and Gold, without
Mine or Mineral, without any apparent
Product; yet how has the improving Geni∣us
of the <HI>English</HI> brought Gold out of their
Dross.</P>
<P>I say Dross; for so it was with respect to
the first Discoverers; and in their Esteem all
our Colonies were but, as we may say, the
Dregs of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first Extraction, the
Refuse Part of their Conquests, their meer
Leavings, that Part of the Country which
they did not think worth so much as look∣ing
into.</P>
<P>WHAT were all our Colonies upon the
Continent, but a little narrow Slip of Land
upon the Sea Coasts, in the cold, wild, un∣hospitable
Climates of the North? And what
our Island Colonies, but a few little despi∣cable
Islands not worth the <HI>Spaniards</HI> posses∣sing,
hardly worth their naming, in Compa∣rison
of their vast Possessions on the Con∣tinent;
nay not worth naming in Compari∣son
of the vast Islands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI>
one of which is bigger than all our
Islands put together; and yet <HI>Cuba</HI> and
<HI>Hispaniola,</HI> tho' equally rich and produc∣tive,
and infinitely full of natural Wealth,
<PB N="305" REF="337"/>
are left umplanted, as not worth their Pains
to improve.</P>
<P><HI>N. B. Barbadoes</HI> is not above 70 Miles
in Circumference, and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> is
above 400 Leagues, <HI>Nevis</HI> not above
20 Miles, and <HI>Cuba</HI> above 690 Miles in
Length.</P>
<P>BUT let us turn our Eyes now and view
the Effects of the Improving <HI>English</HI> Genius,
the Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI>
despis'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as well before we
discover'd them, as afterwards; for the same
<HI>Columbus,</HI> which discover'd <HI>New-Spain,</HI> dis∣cover'd
all the Northern Coast, but left it a∣gain
as not worth while to plant and possess
it. I say, these barren, cold, poor and uncul∣tivated
Climates, the Leavings of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
How have we improved upon them
to infinite Advantages?</P>
<P>NOT discouraged by the Severity of the
Cold, by the Surface over-grown with Bri∣ars
and Thorns, by the early Opposition of
the Natives, a Race of People fierce and
false, untractable, treacherous, irreconcil∣able,
bloody and merciless, even to the most
horrible, and almost inexpressible Cruelties,
who would rarely make Peace, and more
rarely keep their Agreements when made.</P>
<P>OFTEN massacred and butcher'd, and
sometimes quite driven away by the Fury
of the Savages, often starv'd out and fumish∣ed,
and either the whole Body of Planters
wasted, and perishing with Cold and Want,
<PB N="306" REF="338"/>
and as often being reduc'd to Extremities,
forc'd to abandon the Country in the utmost
Distress, and return starving home.</P>
<P>BUT never to be discouraged, how have
they by the meer Force of indefatigable Ap∣plication,
planted, inhabited, cultivated
those inhospitable Climates, those suppos'd
barren Countries, those trifling little Spots
of Islands, not thought worth looking at
by the <HI>Spaniards?</HI> How have they brought
them to be the richest, the most improved,
and the most flourishing Colonies in all that
Part of the World? So populous, so fortify'd,
the People so rich, the Product so great;
and which is more than all, so adapted to
Commerce, so universally embarked in
Trade, that it is at this Time an unresolved
Doubt, whether brings the greatest Wealth
to <HI>Europe,</HI> take the Exportations and Con∣sumptions
of Manufacture there into the
Account of the Return, the Sugars, Tobacco,
and other rich Productions of the <HI>British</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> Colonies; the Fish, the Corn,
the Flesh, the Furrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say, Which are
the greatest in Value, these, or the Gold and
Silver of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI></P>
<P>BUT not to weigh the Particulars, and
come to reckon by Ounces and Drams, this
is certain, and will be granted, that the
Product of our improved Colonies raises
infinitely more Trade, employs more Hands,
and I think, I may say by Consequence,
brings in more Wealth to this one particu∣lar
<PB N="307" REF="339"/>
Nation or People, the <HI>English,</HI> than all
the Mines of <HI>New Spain</HI> do to the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI></P>
<P>AND not to insist only upon the little
Share <HI>Spain</HI> it self reaps from the Returns of
Gold and Silver, made to and landed in their
Country; most of which runs out again in
the very same Species in particular Chan∣nels
of Trade, to other Nations: I say, not
to insist upon this, take the Opulence, the
growing Greatness of the <HI>British</HI> Colonies,
the Numbers of their People, and how pro∣digiously
every Day encreasing; and above
all, that the Encrease of Navigation, the
Number of Ships employ'd, nay Ships built,
and Seamen nurs'd up, the Wealth and Ad∣dition
of Strength we reap from them, which
is not easy to calculate. I say, add this to the
Account, and, I doubt not, it will be grant∣ed,
that the Return of Wealth from <HI>Ameri∣ca</HI>
to this Nation, is equal to the Return of
Gold and Silver from <HI>New</HI> to <HI>Old Spain.</HI></P>
<P>LET any Man calculate the Value of our
Returns in Sugar, Ginger, Indigo, Cotton,
Cocoa, Drugs, Spice, and other Goods,
from the Islands only, with the Furrs or
Peltry; the Rice, Tobacco, Train and Tur∣pentine
Oil, Tar, Masts, and abundance of
other things: Then let them add the Inter∣change
of their other Product, between the
several Colonies, one with another; such as
the Supply of Corn, Pease, Rice, Meal,
Beef, Pork, Beer, Horses, Leather, Fish,
<PB N="308" REF="340"/>
Lumber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all which, the Quantities
are exceeding great; and in which Trade,
several Hundreds, nay some say Thousands,
of Ships and Sloops, are constantly em∣ployed.</P>
<P>In Return for which, a very great Quan∣tity
of Rum, Molasses, Cocoa, Ginger, Su∣gar,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is sent back to the Main-Land Co∣lonies
on the Continent; <HI>of which,</HI> all
that they cannot consume is sent to <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
for Returns.</P>
<P>IF these things are cast up together, in∣cluding
the Consumption of the Woollen
Manufacture of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of all
the Hard-ware Manufacture; also the Cor∣dage,
the Hats, Gloves, and other Leather
Manufactures: In a word, the Consump∣tion
of all the other <HI>British</HI> Goods sent thi∣ther,
the Comparison of Trade will be, out
of Question, on the <HI>British</HI> Side; seeing al∣most
all the Goods exported from <HI>Spain</HI> to
their Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> are first bought
from other Countries.</P>
<P>HAD the <HI>Spaniards</HI> been an industrious,
improving Nation, like the <HI>English,</HI> the
Islands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> alone, hav∣ing
been planted and improved, as our small
Island of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> is improved, would
have produc'd more Sugar, Cotton, Indigo,
Cocoa, Piemento, and other valuable things,
than all <HI>Europe</HI> could have consumed; and
they would have been able to have supply'd
all their other Colonies with Flesh, such as
<PB N="309" REF="341"/>
Beef and Pork, and with Rice and other
things, more than they could consume.</P>
<P>IN lieu of which, those fruitful Islands
are now left to lye waste, untill'd, implant∣ed,
and the great Discoverers have not made
any one Step that deserves the Name of
Improvement upon them, except only the
fortifying the Port of the <HI>Havana;</HI> which
Necessity almost drove them to for the
Protection of their Commerce to their o∣ther
Colonies, and forming the Rendezvous
of their <HI>Galleons,</HI> in their passing and re∣passing
between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREAS, take our Colonies on the
<HI>Leward</HI> Islands only into Consideration,
(here indeed we have improv'd to the ut∣most)
there is hardly an Inch of Ground lost
in the Island of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> that can produce
one Ounce of any thing more than it does;
the like perhaps cannot be said of any one
Spot of Ground in the World, which con∣taining
in the whole not above 70 Miles in
Circumference, employs and maintains a∣bove
100000 People, including the Negroe
Slaves, enriches the Planters to a surprising
Degree, and fully employs above 300 Sail of
Ships and Sloops, always running with Pro∣visions
of Fish, Fiesh, Corn, and Cattle,
from <HI>North America,</HI> Wine from the <HI>Ma∣deras,</HI>
and with Slaves (Negroes) from the
Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and with Manufactory
and Merchant-Goods from <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="342"/>
THE same, in its Proportion, might be
said of the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were the Discoverers, that is, in
the room of the Inventors, and made little
or nothing of it, and we are the Improvers;
and what that Improvement is, we all know:
That Island for its Planting, and its other Ad∣vances
of Trade, is at this Time the great∣est
Article in all our <HI>West India</HI> Commerce;
and if some nice Calculators may be allowed
to judge right, the Product of the Island of
<HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the Consumption of Goods
there from <HI>England,</HI> or which goes that
Way, to <HI>New Spain,</HI> makes the Trade of the
Island superior at this Time to the Trade
of all our other Islands; that is to say, the
Islands of <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Antegoa, Mount∣serat,</HI>
and <HI>St. Christophers,</HI> put together,
and this Trade every Day encreasing too.</P>
<P>NOR is the Improvement of <HI>Jamaica</HI> im∣properly
call'd advancing upon the Inven∣tion
of others; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did for
themselves make several Experiments in
Trade; they planted originally in <HI>Jamaica</HI>
several things, which were then meer Inven∣tions
in Planting, which the <HI>English</HI> have
since improved upon, and which are not to
be produc'd in any of the other <HI>English</HI>
Islands; such as the <HI>Cocoa, Piemento, Indi∣go,</HI>
and several other things which the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
have since brought to a great Perfection
by their Improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="343"/>
THEY likewise laid the Foundation of that
secret Commerce with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Colonies,
which the <HI>English</HI> have improv'd to such a
Degree, as it is even threatning to the whole
Trade of <HI>New Spain;</HI> for when the <HI>English</HI>
conquer'd the Island from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
those <HI>Spanish</HI> Families, which remain'd upon
the Island, keeping up a Correspondence
with their Friends and former Acquaintan∣ces
in <HI>Cartagena,</HI> St. <HI>Martha,</HI> and the
Coast of <HI>Caracas,</HI> and all the other Ports of
that Country, that Intimacy became the
Foundation of an advantageous Correspon∣dence,
since carry'd on; and the improving
<HI>English</HI> brought forth from it a Trade
grown up by Time, and the particular En∣couragements
of succeeding Ages, to a pro∣digious
Magnitude.</P>
<P>BUT these are things behind us, and may
perhaps be call'd, <HI>looking back to what is
past;</HI> whereas the Eyes of Mankind are ra∣ther
fix'd upon things before them; and
where we talk of Inventing and Improving,
the Enquiry is, what Inventions are now
upon the Anvil, for our improving Genius
to work upon? What is there that at pre∣sent
offers for the Application of an inge∣nious
People? And this brings me to the
grand Head proposed in this Treatise, (<HI>viz</HI>)
Schemes of Improvement in Commerce,
which are to be the Subject of this latter
Part of the Work.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="312" REF="344"/>
<HEAD>CAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a PROPOSAL for rooting out those
Nests of Pyrates and Rovers, the Turks
or Moors of Tunis, Tripoli, Algier, and
Sallee, who have for so many, Ages infested

Spain and Portugal, to the infinite Loss
and Discouragement of all the Trading
Nations of Europe.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With a Scheme for the Improvement of Trade,
by restoring and establishing the an∣cient
Commerce on the North and North-West
Coast of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>IN speaking of <HI>Africa,</HI> as it once was the
the Seat of Commerce for the whole
World, we must look back as far as to the
flourishing State of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Go∣vernment;
but it shall be as short as can
be desired..</P>
<P>IT is true, as has been observed by a well
informed Writer on this Subject, that the
<HI>Romans</HI> (like the <HI>Turks</HI> in our Time)
were no Friends to Trade; they carry'd on
their War for Glory; like meer Soldiers
they fought to conquer, and conquer'd to
plunder, not to plant and people the World:
So far were they from encouraging or
improving the Commerce and Wealth of
the Nations they subdued, that they over∣threw
and destroy'd the greatest Trading
Cities in the World; such as <HI>Corinth, Syra∣cuse,
<PB N="313" REF="345"/>
Carthage,</HI> and all the Cities of <HI>Aegypt</HI>
and <HI>Africa:</HI> Instead of encouraging Trade
and Navigation, they murther'd the Mer∣chants,
burnt their Ships, and carry'd away
the People, which are the Life and Support
of Manufacture and Trade.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI>
as they had the richest Soil and a numerous
People, (for <HI>Africa</HI> was then infinitely popu∣lous)
they improved the first, and employ'd
the last, to the utmost; their People were as
rich as they were numerous, they carry'd
on Trade to all the Parts of the World,
planted Colonies, built Cities Abroad, and
Ships at Home; and wherever they came,
whether by Conquest, or by Consent, they
planted the Country, not destroy'd it, car∣ry'd
People to it, not away from it; and,
in a word, made them rich, not plunder'd
and starv'd them.</P>
<P><HI>Carthage</HI> and <HI>Corinth</HI> at that Time were
the two great Emporiums of the World;
<HI>this</HI> carry'd on all the Commerce of the <HI>West</HI>
and <HI>that</HI> of the <HI>East: Corinth</HI> manag'd the
Commerce of <HI>Asia, Persia,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and
brought the Wealth of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> the
Spices, the Silks, the Callicoes, the Gold,
the Diamonds, and in a word, the whole
<HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Trade in Caravans;
Part from <HI>Ormus</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI>
to <HI>Bassora</HI> and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> by Water, and thence
by Caravans to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> and
so by Sea to the Gulph of <HI>Cenchraea</HI> and <HI>Co∣rinth,</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="346"/>
another Part to <HI>Trapezond</HI> in <HI>Arme∣nia,</HI>
and by the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea thro' the Straits
of <HI>Bosphorus</HI> and the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and thro'
the <HI>Archipelague</HI> to the same Gulph, and so
to <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Carthage,</HI> on the other hand, planted Co∣lonies,
and extended their Possessions upon
the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> as well within as with∣out
the <HI>Straits;</HI> built Cities from <HI>New
Carthage,</HI> now call'd <HI>Carthagena</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI>
to the <HI>Groyn,</HI> as well in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
as in the Ocean, and from <HI>Tangier,</HI> then
a populous City of 100000 Inhabitants, to
the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> on the West Side of <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI>
and from thence into <HI>America</HI> it self;
which, there is no room to doubt, was disco∣vered
if not peopled from <HI>Africa,</HI> by the in∣defatigable
<HI>Carthaginians;</HI> and had never
been lost and forgotten to this Part of the
World, if the <HI>Romans,</HI> those Destroyers and
Enemies of all Improvement, Commerce,
and Navigation, had not so utterly ruin'd
<HI>Carthage,</HI> not the City only, but the very
Nation, as not to leave them a Name under
Heaven; and so of course caus'd all their re∣motest
Settlements to be abandon'd; and in
consequence, at last forgotten; <HI>but that by
the way,</HI> it requires, and indeed deserves too
long a Digression for this Place.</P>
<P>NOW, when these two Cities of <HI>Corinth</HI>
and <HI>Carthage</HI> fell, (for they were destroy'd
by the <HI>Romans</HI> within a Year of one another)
Trade receiv'd a mortal Wound; I may say
<PB N="315" REF="347"/>
the Trade of the whole World did so; and
as those Cities never recovered, so the Trade,
which was fixed among them, decay'd and
dy'd, was divided and scatter'd, and, in ef∣fect,
lost; for it never fully recover'd it self,
no not to this Day.</P>
<P>THE Colonies, which the <HI>Carthaginians</HI>
planted, sunk and dy'd away, and many of
them lie in Ruins to this Day; especially on
that Side of the Ocean from the <HI>Straits
Mouth</HI> to <HI>Cape None;</HI> for as the <HI>Cartha∣ginians</HI>
planted Colonies for Trade, the
Trade being lost by the Overthrow of the
Merchants in the Mother City <HI>Carthage,</HI>
the new planted Cities, and the Sea Ports,
were ruined of course, and perished, as a
Child starves when the Nurse is taken
from it.</P>
<P>IT is true, the City of <HI>Carthage</HI> was re∣built,
and recover'd it self <HI>in some Degree,</HI>
under the Government of the Western Em∣perors;
and especially as those Emperors
were Christians, and were Encouragers of
the Industry and Application of their Sub∣jects;
then, <HI>I say,</HI> the trading Genius reviv'd
very much, especially in <HI>Africa,</HI> and the
Climate and Soil of that Country being par∣ticularly
productive of many valuable things,
and those things adapted to Trade, and en∣couraging
to the Merchant, the <HI>African</HI>
Merchants carry'd on a very considerable Bu∣siness;
Navigation also being very much their
Peculiar, they traded by Sea to all the known
<PB N="316" REF="348"/>
Parts of the World, but nothing like what
they did before.</P>
<P>THE principal Branches of their Com∣merce
in those Times, as we gather from
the Histories of the neighbouring Coun∣tries,
consisted, <HI>1st.</HI> in exporting the Growth
of their Country, and the Manufacture of
their People, just as it is with us in <HI>Britain:</HI>
For the Nature of Commerce is ever and
every where the same. And <HI>2dly,</HI> in im∣porting
again the Product of other Coun∣tries,
either for their own Consumption, or
for Re-exportation to remoter Parts, which
had not the same Product.</P>
<P>THEIR own Product consisted chiefly in
Corn and Cattle, and among the last, chiefly
Horses, of which they furnished great Num∣bers
to mount the <HI>Roman</HI> Cavalry; for the
<HI>Numidian Horse</HI> were then, as the <HI>Barbs</HI>
and <HI>Jennets</HI> (which are the same) are now,
fam'd for their Beauty, Swiftness, and fine
Shapes, thro' all the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But above all their Product, the most va∣luable
were their Wax and Copper, in both
which they still excel the whole World; al∣so
their Corn, Fruit, Druggs, and rich
Gums, all which remain to them.</P>
<P>FOR Manufactures, we do not indeed
read of their Woollen Manufactures, or at
least, not much: But the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> as
well as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> (and both were <HI>Afri∣cans</HI>)
are fam'd for the Product of fine Lin∣en;
and 'tis to be supposed the Soil produc'd
<PB N="317" REF="349"/>
a very fine kind of Flax, which, as the Fund
of that Manufacture, they improved to
great Advantage; but that Part is now
lost.</P>
<P>AS to their Importations, we are assur'd
they fetch'd Tin and Lead from <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
Gold and Wine from <HI>Spain,</HI> for old
<HI>Spain</HI> ever produc'd much Gold; Silks and
fine <HI>East India Goods</HI> from <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>A∣lexandria;</HI>
what Trade they had with
<HI>Gaul (France</HI>) we do not find, but the
other was very considerable, and is sufficient
to our Purpose. Thus stood their Condi∣tion
flourishing in Wealth and Commerce,
when the <HI>Romans,</HI> as above, to the eternal
Infamy, not Glory, of their very Name,
destroy'd them all.</P>
<P>AS by that general Rule, I say, the Trade
of the World receiv'd a mortal Wound; so
when I say they reviv'd under the <HI>Roman</HI>
and <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperors, it was apparent all
their Recovery and Encrease was owing to
their Commerce; that alone restor'd them,
and enrich'd them; and they were in <HI>Justi∣nian</HI>'s
Time the most valuable Branch of
the Western Empire, with respect to the
Taxes they paid, and the many Regiments,
or rather Legions, they raised, for recruiting
the <HI>Roman</HI> Armies under <HI>Belisari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and
other Generals; and this continued long af∣terwards,
even in the most declining Times
of the Western Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="350"/>
BUT this rising Wealth of <HI>Africa</HI> was
too rich a Bait for the Times; the Deluge
of barbarous Nations, which overthrew the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, broke in upon them also;
and the <HI>Vandals,</HI> over-running <HI>Spain,</HI> spread
themselves into <HI>Africa,</HI> wasted and over-run
the fruitful Plains, and destroy'd and
overturned the populous Cities; and in a
word, Trade sunk a second Time, under
the unsupportable Burden of War, the
<HI>Vandals,</HI> over-running all, ruin'd and pos∣sess'd
the Country.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>Vandals</HI> came in over the Bellies
of the native Inhabitants, so some Ages af∣ter
them the <HI>Saracens; Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Ma∣homitans,</HI>
came in over the Heads of the
<HI>Vandals.</HI></P>
<P>WITH these, not the old <HI>Africans</HI> only
were rooted out; not only Religion, but at
last Trade too, sunk quite out of the Coun∣try;
for, as the Followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> are,
wherever they come, like the <HI>Romans,</HI> the
Destroyers both of Commerce and Cultiva∣tion,
so it was here.</P>
<P>TRADE and Improvement being thus, I
say, as it were rooted out in <HI>Africa,</HI> the
Moors spread themselves, by a rapid and ir∣resistible
Torrent, over all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI>
carrying all before them, and keeping
Possession of it almost the Space of 800
Years; and as for <HI>Africa,</HI> they have by a
strong Hand kept Possession there ever since:</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="351"/>
<HI>To bring all this to the case in hand,</HI> These
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> as I have said of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
have very little Inclination to Trade, they
have no Gust to it, no Taste of it, or of the
Advantages of it; but dwelling on the Sea-coast,
and being a rapacious, cruel, violent,
and tyrannical People, void of all Industry
or Application, neglecting all Culture and
Improvement, it made them Thieves and
Robbers, as naturally as Idleness makes Beg∣gars:
They disdain'd all Industry and La∣bour;
but being bred up to Rapine and
Spoil, when they were no longer able to
ravage and plunder the fruitful Plains of
<HI>Valentia, Granada</HI> and <HI>Andalusia,</HI> they fell
to roving upon the Sea; they built Ships, or
rather, took Ships from others, and ravag'd
the Coasts, landing in the Night, surprising
and carrying away the poor Country Peo∣ple
out of their Beds into Slavery.</P>
<P>THIS was their first Trade, and this na∣turally
made Pyrates of them; for, not be∣ing
content with landing and plundering
the Sea-coast of <HI>Spain;</HI> they by Degrees be∣ing
grown powerful and rich, made bold
and audacious by their Success, they arm'd
their Ships, and began to attack first the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the high Seas, and then
all the Christian Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> where∣ever
they could find them. And thus
this wicked Trade of Roving and Robbing
began.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="352"/>
WHAT Magnitude they are since that
arriv'd to, what Mischiefs they have brought
upon the trading Part of the World, how
powerful they are grown, and how they
are erected into States and Governments,
nay into Kingdoms, and as they would be
called, Empires (for the Kings of <HI>Fez</HI> and
<HI>Morocco</HI> call themselves Emperors) and
how they are, to the Disgrace even of all
the Christian Powers treated with as such,
is Matter of History, and I shall meddle
no more with it here, than is absolutely ne∣ry
to my present purpose.</P>
<P>THE first Christian Prince that resenting
the Insolence of these Barbarians, and disdain∣ing
to make Peace with them, resolved their
Destruction, was the Emperor <HI>Char.</HI> V. He
was mov'd with a generous Compassion, for
the many Thousands of poor unfortunate
Christians which were at that Time kept
among them in miserable Slavery; and from
a noble Principle of setting the Christian
World free from the Terror of such Barba∣rians,
he undertook singly, and without
the Assistance of any other Nation, to fall
upon them with all his Power.</P>
<P>IN this War had he been join'd by the
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns;
(as for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they were not then a
Nation) he might have clear'd the Coun∣try,
at least he might have clear'd the Sea
Coasts of the whole Race, and have planted
Colonies of Christians in all the Ports, for
<PB N="321" REF="353"/>
the Encouragement of Commerce, and for
the Safety of all the European Nations.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Francis</HI> the first King of <HI>France,</HI>
his mortal and constant Enemy envy'd him
the Glory of the greatest and best Enter∣prise
that was ever undertaken in Europe;
a Thousand Times beyond all the Cruisa∣does
and Expeditions to the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI>
which cost <HI>Europe</HI> a Million of Lives, and
an immense Treasure, during one Hundred
and twenty Years, to no Purpose.</P>
<P>AS it was, and tho' the Emperor was as∣sisted
by no one Prince in <HI>Christendom,</HI> the
Pope excepted, (and his Artillery would not
go far in battering Stone Walls) yet he took
the Fortress of <HI>Goletta,</HI> and afterwards the
City, and the whole Kingdom of <HI>Tunis;</HI>
and had he kept the Possession, it might
have been a happy Fore-Runner of farther
Conquest; but miscarrying in his Attempt
against <HI>Algier,</HI> by the meer Hand of Heaven,
who we may hope reserved that Conquest
for the Glory of Princes and Powers yet
to come, and a terrible Storm falling upon
his Fleet, the farther Attempt was laid
aside, and the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis</HI> returned
to its former Possessors, by which Means
their Pyracies are still continued.</P>
<P>MY Proposal upon this Subject consists
of two Parts.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THE Necessity there seems to be
upon all the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> especially
the Marine Powers, to free themselves from
<PB N="322" REF="354"/>
the Insolence of these Rovers, that so their
Subjects may be protected in their Per∣sons
and Goods from the Hands of Ra∣pine
and Violence, their Coasts secured
from Insults and Descents, and their Ships
from Capture on the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT this cannot be done ef∣fectually,
but by rooting out those Nests of
Robbers on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and at
least driving them from the Possession of
any of the Towns, Ports and Harbours, so
as that they may have no more Ships to
appear upon the Seas.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE Easiness of the Conquest, if
the <HI>English, Dutch, French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI>
would but please to join their Forces, and
Fleets, and fall upon them in separate Bo∣dies,
and in several Places at the same
Time; the needful Quotas both of Ships
and Troops might be also adjusted here.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THE Benefit of Commerce,
which would immediately follow, by set∣tling
the Government of the Sea Coast
Towns in the Hands and Possession of the
several united Powers, so that every one
should possess the least in Proportion to the
Forces employed in the Conquests <HI>of it.</HI></P>
<P>THE three first of these merit well to be
spoken to, and that largely too, but I have
not Room for it here, the last is particularly
before me.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied, that the Coast of
<HI>Africa,</HI> some few Places excepted, is a
<PB N="323" REF="355"/>
fruitful rich Country; and tho' by its La∣titude
it must be exceeding hot, and that
(especially on the Eastmost Parts of it) there
are many Deserts and waste Places given up
to salt and Sand, and fit only for the Re∣treat
of the wild Beasts, such as Lions,
Leopards, Tygers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the fiercest and
most ravenous of those we call Beasts of
Prey; yet even in that Part there are Va∣leys
and Plains intersperst among the wild∣est
Deserts, and which are fruitful, yield
Corn in abundance, and Cattle, with several
Fruits and other Productions, fitted not
for the Use of the Inhabitants only, but for
Merchandize, and in Quantities also suffici∣ent
for both.</P>
<P>THE general Product of the Country,
and in which the chief Wealth consists, and
upon which a Trade with them would be
settled, if the Country was in the Hands of
Christians, is as follows.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Corn</ITEM>
<ITEM>Salt</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wool</ITEM>
<ITEM>Horses</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wax</ITEM>
<ITEM>Honey</ITEM>
<ITEM>Corall</ITEM>
<ITEM>Copper</ITEM>
<ITEM>Skins of Beasts</ITEM>
<ITEM>Drugs and Gums</ITEM>
<ITEM>Almonds</ITEM>
<ITEM>Pomegranates</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ostrich Feathers</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lions and Leopards</ITEM>
<ITEM>Provisions of sundry
Kinds.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IF the Quantity of all these is so consi∣derable
as we find it to be, even now, un∣der
<PB N="324" REF="356"/>
the Indolence and Sloth of the most
barbarous People in the World, how may
we suppose all those valuable Things to be
encreas'd in their Quantity, by the Industry
and Application of the diligent Europeans,
especially the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>English;</HI>
all which Nations joining in the Conquest,
we might reasonably suppose should have
their several and separate Allotments of
Territory upon the Coast, and in the Coun∣try
adjacent.</P>
<P>WE might also reasonably suppose, that
the Moors being in the Consequence of
such a Conquest, driven up farther into
the Country (for I have not been proposing
the rooting them out as a Nation, but only
the supplanting or removing them from a
Situation, which they have justly forfeited
by their Depredations upon other Nations)
and being obliged to seek their Subsistence
by honest Labour and Application, I say
we may reasonably suppose, that even these
may be taught to apply to the Cultivation
of the Earth by the meer Necessity of their
Circumstances, and may be brought to en∣crease
the Product by their Labour for
all those Christian Nations.</P>
<P>AS the Product of the Country would thus
be encreas'd, and Multitudes of People
would be encouraged by the Advantages of
the Place, to go over and settle upon it;
the Manufactures and Merchandizes of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
would by Consequence find a new Con∣sumption,
<PB N="325" REF="357"/>
and the many new Ports and
Harbours, where those Christian Nations
would settle, would be so many new Mar∣kets
for the Sale of those Manufactures,
where they had Little or no Sale or Consump∣tion
before: And this indeed is the Sum of all
Improvement in Trade, namely, the finding
out some Market for the Sale or Vent of
Merchandize, where there was no Sale or
Vent for those Goods before; to find out
some Nation, and introduce some Fashions
or Customs among them for the Use of our
Goods, where there was no Use of such
Goods before, to vend our Goods at new
or differing Ports, may be no Encrease
of Commerce, or to send them to new and
differing Places, because they may still be
sent from thence to the same People, and
to the same Nations as the last Consumers,
who consumed them before.</P>
<P>THUS sending our <HI>English</HI> Manufactures
to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to be sold there by the
Sloop-Trade; that is, by clandestine Com∣merce
with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Smugglers, or to
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and the Coast
of <HI>Caracas,</HI> is no new Consumption, tho'
it be a new Market; because it is only
selling to the same People, who would
otherwise call for the same Manufacture,
and other Goods from <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and they
from <HI>England;</HI> so that it is as Water issuing
out of the same Fountain, and running into
<PB N="326" REF="358"/>
the same Gulph or Pond, only by new
Channels.</P>
<P>THUS likewise the East India Company
sending <HI>English</HI> Broad Cloth to the Gulph
of <HI>Persia,</HI> to be sent from thence to <HI>Ispa∣han,</HI>
to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and other Places in that
Country, to be sold to the <HI>Persians,</HI> and
others, as the last Consumers; is only sup∣plying
the same People, who were supplied
before, with the same Goods from <HI>Alleppo</HI>
and <HI>Scandaroon;</HI> so that it is only taking
the Trade from the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company, and
transferring it to the East India Company,
which is no Encrease of Commerce, the
last Consumers being the same.</P>
<P>BRING this to the Case of the <HI>Barbary</HI>
Trade; it is true we have some Trade there
now, and some Places might on some Ac∣counts
be called the same Markets: But
suppose the <HI>Barbarians</HI> to be removed as
above from the populous Cities and Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Algier, Tunis, Tripoli,</HI> &amp;c. and
driven up the Country, in order to suppress
Pyracy and Robbers; and suppose those Ci∣ties,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> peopled with a new Nation, or
new Nations made rich by Commerce, and
the Country adjacent cultivated and peo∣pled
after the Manner of <HI>Europe,</HI> and those
People living, cloathing, furnishing their
Houses and Equipages, and feeding after
the Manner of Christians, and Christian
Nations: Let it be answered, what Kind
of Commerce would there be then? And
<PB N="327" REF="359"/>
would it be twenty Times what it is now,
or would it not? besides delivering <HI>Europe</HI>
from the Depredations of powerful Thieves,
and their Commerce and Navigation from
the Rapine of a merciless Crew, who are
the Ruin of Thousands of Families, and
in some Sense the Reproach of Christen∣dom:
I need say no more, the Proposal is
great, but far from Impracticable, 'tis
worthy being undertaken by the Princes and
Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> and what would bring
more Glory to the Christian Name, than all
their Intestine Wars, one against another,
the Scandal of <HI>Europe;</HI> and the only Thing
that at first let in the <HI>Turks,</HI> and other Bar∣barians
among them.</P>

made by CONQUEST, a Thing attended
with Difficulty, Hazard, Expence, and a
Possibility of Miscarriage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER easy it is to remove all the
Objections of that Kind, it is not my
Business here, nor have I Room for it; but
I mention them here to illustrate and set off
the happy Circumstance of another Proposal
of Improvement on the same Continent; I
mean this of <HI>Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>HERE are no Conquests to be made, no
Enemies to fight with, at least none worth
naming; and yet here is a visible, an ap∣parent,
an undisputed Improvement to be
made, of which this only is to be said, That
'tis rather wonderful, that it has never yet
been attempted, and gone about with Vi∣gour
and Resolution, than doubtful whether
it would succeed, if it were undertaken.</P>
<P>THE Climate on the West Coast of <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI>
at least within the Bounds mention'd,
is sufficiently known, being from the Lati∣tude
of about 13 Deg. to that of 5 Deg.
North of the Line: The Soil is good in
most Places, very fruitful, well water'd,
notwithstanding the Heat of the Climate,
with abundance of small Rivers, and in
some Places with very great ones.</P>
<P>THE Commerce to this Country is car∣ried
on, if a Kind of Stagnation of Busi∣ness,
or a going backward thro' innume∣rable
Discouragements may be call'd a car∣rying
it on, by the <HI>English</HI> having Pos∣session
<PB N="329" REF="361"/>
of the Coast, and having made Set∣tlements
in proper Places, with Forts and
Castles, and other Strengths for defending
those Settlements, as well against their Chri∣stian
Neighbours by Sea, as their Savage
Neighbours on Land.</P>
<P>THE Trade carried on here, whether by
the <HI>English,</HI> or other European Nations,
consists in but three capital Articles, viz.
<HI>Slaves, Teeth,</HI> and <HI>Gold;</HI> a very gainful
and advantageous Commerce, especially as
it was once carried on, when these were all
purchas'd at low Rates from the Savages;
and even those low Rates paid in Trifles, and
Toys, such as Knives and Sissars, Kettles and
Clouts, Glass Beads, and Cowries, Things
of the smallest Value, and as we may say
next to nothing; but even this Part of the
Trade is abated in its Goodness, since by
the Strife and Envy among the Traders,
we have had the Folly to instruct the Sa∣vages
in the Value of their own Goods, and
inform them of the Cheapness of our own;
endeavouring to supplant one another, by
underselling and overbidding, by which we
have taught the Negroes to supplant both,
by holding up the Price of their own Pro∣ductions,
and running down the Rates of
what we carry them for Sale.</P>
<P>THUS that gainful Commerce once supe∣rior
to all the Trades in the World, which
carried out the meanest of all Exportations,
and brought home the richest, is sinking
<PB N="330" REF="362"/>
dayly into a Kind of Rubbish as to Trade;
and we are sometimes said to buy even
the Gold too dear.</P>
<P>BUT all this while here is not the least
Use made of the Land; the fruitful Soil lies
waste, a vast extended Country, pleasant
Vallies, the Banks of charming Rivers, spa∣cious
Plains, capable of Improvement and
Cultivation, to infinite Advantage, lie
waste and untouch'd, over-run with Shrub∣age
and useless Trees; as a Forrest trod un∣der
Foot with wild Creatures; and the yet
wilder Negroes, who just plant their Maize,
and a few Roots and Herbs, like as we do
for our Garden-stuff, and all the rest is
left naked, and thrown up to the Wil∣derness.</P>
<P>NOW, why is all this waste? What mean
the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and other
diligent Nations, to neglect such Advanta∣ges?
Why do they not enclose, fence, and
set apart such Lands for Cultivation, as by
their Nature and Situation appear to be
proper for the most advantageous Pro∣ductions?</P>
<P>LET the same Climates be examin'd in
other Parts of the World, and the Soil in
those Climates be compared with the Soil
in the same Latitudes on this Coast; and if
it is the same, or so near the same, as no
visible Difference is found in them, why
should they not produce the same Harvest,
the same Plants, Fruits, Druggs; or, what∣ever
<PB N="331" REF="363"/>
grows and is produced in one, why
should it not be planted, grow, and produce
the same in another?</P>
<P>LET us reduce this to Practice, and bring
the Latitude of Places together, with the
Productions proper to those Places: For
Example,</P>
<P>1. THE Coffee-Berry is the natural Pro∣duct
of the Earth at <HI>Mocha,</HI> on the Eastern
Bank of the Red Sea, and the South-west
Point of the <HI>Arabia Faelix,</HI> in the Latitude
of 13 to 14 Deg. there it grows, thrives, and
produces, as it were wild, and with the least
Help of Labour imaginable; what Assistance
of Art is added to it, is after the Fruit is
ripen'd and gather'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in the curing and
drying the Berry, and preserving them for
a Market; and that is to be done in the
same Manner in any Part of the World as
well as there.</P>
<P>THE diligent <HI>Dutch</HI> seeing the Easiness of
the managing and curing the Berry, and how
that Part had no Dependence, either upon
the Earth, the Air, the Water, or any thing
else more there, than in another Place, took
the Hint, and planted the Coffee Tree in
the Island of <HI>Java,</HI> near their City of <HI>Bata∣via,</HI>
there it thrives, bears, and ripens eve∣ry
jot as well as at <HI>Mocha;</HI> and now they
begin to leave off the Red Sea, and bring
20 to 30 Tons of Coffee, at a time, from
<HI>Batavia,</HI> in the Latitude of 5 Deg. S.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="364"/>
NOT content with this happy Improve∣ment,
others of the same Nation have made
the like Experiment, in near the same Lati∣tude,
in another Quarter of the World, and
with the like Success; and now they begin
to bring large Quantities of Coffee from <HI>Su∣rinam,</HI>
on the North Coast of South <HI>A∣merica,</HI>
Lat 6 1/2 Deg.</P>
<P>WE are told likewise, tho' this, however
probable, I do not affirm, that the less in∣dustrious
<HI>Portuguese</HI> are planting it on the
Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> about the <HI>Rio de St. Fran∣cisco</HI>
in the Latitude of 12 Deg.</P>
<P>AND besides these, we are assur'd the
<HI>French</HI> have planted it with Success it their
Colony of <HI>Port Dauphin</HI> on the Island
<HI>Madagascar,</HI> in Lat. 23 1/2 Deg. S.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> indeed planted it without
Success at the Cape <HI>de Bon Esperanza:</HI>
The Reason is plain, the Place was too
cold, and it might as well be planted at our
Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> the
Cape lying, as we all know, in Latitude
34 Deg. 20 M. or thereabouts.</P>
<P>BUT if at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Surinam,</HI> in La∣titude
5 to 6 Deg. if at <HI>Mocha,</HI> in Latitude
14 Deg. if at <HI>Port Dauphin,</HI> in Latitude
23 1/2 Deg. why not at <HI>Seraloon</HI> under Cape
<HI>de Verd,</HI> in Latitude 13 to 15 Deg.? Why
not at Cape <HI>Coast</HI> and at <HI>Accra,</HI> in Latitude
5 to 6 Deg.? And, in a word, Why not up∣on
all the Grain Coast, Tooth Coast, Gold
and Slave Coast, where we have a free Pos∣session,
<PB N="333" REF="365"/>
Strength for Protection, and Soil
for Production? But I proceed, I shall
be shorter in the next Articles, because the
Argument is the same.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Sugar Cane.</HI> Our Success with
the Sugar Canes is well known, it is pro∣duced
to an infinite Advantage in our Island
Colonies of <HI>America.</HI> From <HI>St. Christo∣phers</HI>
in Latitude 17 1/2 Deg. and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in
Latitude 18 Deg. to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> in Latitude
13 Deg. It is produc'd by the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
in the <HI>Brasils,</HI> in the same Latitude, South
of the Line from the Port of <HI>Phernambuquo,</HI>
in the Latitude of 9 Deg. to the Bay <HI>de
Todos los Santos,</HI> or Bay of <HI>All Saints,</HI> in
the Latitude of 13 Deg. 20 M. and it is pro∣duced
by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Continent
of North <HI>America,</HI> in the Provinces of
<HI>Guaxaca, Guatimala,</HI> &amp;c. in the Latitude
of 14 Deg. And why not then by us on
the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> where we have the
Choice of the Country in the very same La∣titude
from the <HI>Gold Coast</HI> in the Latitude 6,
to the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> in the Latitude 15.</P>
<P>ADD to this the particular Advantages
which offer themselves to the Planter, in
such an Attempt as this, on the Coast of
<HI>Africa,</HI> which he has not, nor can have,
in any of those Parts where the Sugar is
now planted, especially by the <HI>English.</HI> For
Example,</P>
<P>1. THE Easiness of procuring Negroe
Slaves, which would here cost from 30 s. to
<PB N="334" REF="366"/>
50 s. or at most 3 l. <HI>per</HI> Head; whereas they
are at this Time in <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
worth from 25 l. to 30 l. a Head; at the
<HI>Brasils</HI> from 30 l. to 40 l. and to the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in the Provinces of <HI>Guaxaca, Guati∣mala,</HI>
&amp;c. 50 to 60 l. <HI>Sterling per</HI> Head.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THE Difficulty of keeping the
Negroes from running away, is not so
great as some imagine, since as they are
brought from distant Provinces, tho' it
be upon the same Continent, they know
nothing of their own Country; nor
do they understand the Language of
the next Negroes, any more than
they do <HI>English;</HI> and if they should
fly to these neighbouring Negroes, they
would but make Slaves of them again,
and sell them to the Ships; so that the
Slaves would not be apt to fly, and if
they did, the Loss would not be near
so great as in <HI>Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Easiness of getting Provisions,
which they would be so far from fetching
from <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>New England,</HI> as our Colo∣nies
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> do, and at a
very monstrous rate; that they would be al∣ways
able to furnish themselves as they do
now by the Produce of the Soil; as for Rice,
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, or Maize, with Roots, such
as Potatoes, Parsneps, Carrots, Plantans,
and innumerable other Sorts, they grow
freely upon all the Coast.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="367"/>
3. THE Shortness of the Distance, and the
safe Passage between <HI>England</HI> and these Co∣lonies,
is such, that the Voyage is often per∣form'd
in 12 or 15 Days; whereas six to ten
Weeks is counted no bad Voyage between
<HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>London:</HI> The Expence as well
as other Inconveniences of which are ex∣ceeding
great, and the Difference would give
the Sugars of <HI>Africa</HI> a great Advantage at
Market.</P>
<P>3. I come next to the Planting of <HI>Tea.</HI>
Every one that has been the length of <HI>A∣moy</HI>
or <HI>Chusan</HI> on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> knows
that the Tea is produced chiefly in the Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Xantung, Nanquin</HI> and <HI>Canton,</HI>
as also in the Islands of <HI>Japon</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI>
most of it between the Latitudes of 30
Deg. and 24 Deg. North of the Line. With
how much greater Advantage then of the
Climate, might the same Plant be produced
at <HI>Seraloon</HI> and on the Gold Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI>
the Plants being fetch'd from <HI>China,</HI> as well
as the Method of curing it; which, accor∣ding
to Mynheer <HI>Nieuhoft,</HI> is not difficult.</P>
<P>I need say very little to the Advantages
of raising such a profitable Plant so near
Home; the thing explains it self; and the
Difficulty of making the Experiment, seems
to me to be little or nothing. Nay, I am
told, that in the Governor's Garden at
Cape <HI>Coast</HI> Castle, there is, or at least was, in
the Time of the Government of Sir <HI>Dalby
Thomas,</HI> a large Plant of <HI>Tea</HI> planted, and
<PB N="336" REF="368"/>
that it grew and thrived to Admiration: I
confess I cannot see why it should not.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Head with one yet
more considerable than all the rest; and that
is, the great Article of the Spices, such as
Nutmegs, Cloves, and Cinamon; the two
last are found in the Islands of <HI>Ternate</HI> and
others adjacent in the Latitude of 2 to 4 Deg.
the <HI>Nutmegs</HI> indeed are found only at <HI>Banda</HI>
and some small Islands adjoining and almost
under the Line, and so it may be doubtful, ex∣cept
in the same Latitude, which is farther
South than any of our Settlements in <HI>Afri∣ca</HI>
go: But the Trial might be made of that
too. But as to the Clove, it is found in the
Island of <HI>Borneo</HI> at <HI>Gilolo,</HI> and several other
Islands, from the Latitudes of 2 to 7 Deg.
which is exactly the Climate of our Gold
Coast; likewise the Cinamon is found in
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> in the Lat of 6 to 7 Deg. and hits
punctually with this Coast; and we can see
no Reason why the same Climate on the
Shore of <HI>Africa</HI> may not by the Help of
Art produce the same Fruit.</P>
<P>I sum up all with observing, That there
is no reason to doubt, but all or most of the
Productions, either of the East or West
<HI>Indies,</HI> might be produced here; such as the
Cotton, Ginger, Sugar, Cocoa, Piemento, In∣digo,
and several others known at <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
as also the Cochineal, the Vinelloes, and
even the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark also, if Industry and
<PB N="337" REF="369"/>
Application were set on work to plant
them.</P>
<P>I cannot quit the Improvements which
might be made on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI>
without mentioning a great Correspondence
carried on among the several Nations in the
northern Part of that Country, which <HI>even
as it is now</HI> causes a great Commerce over
Land, taking Notice withal how wonderfully
it might be improv'd: This Trade is said to
be carried on by the Negroe Natives, upon
the great River <HI>Nigris</HI> or <HI>Niger;</HI> or as our
Seamen call it corruptly, the River <HI>Gambia,</HI>
in Conjunction with the Natives of several
Nations, upon the same River, East from the
Shore; and by all these together correspon∣ding
with the Moors on the north Coast of
<HI>Africa,</HI> at <HI>Fez,</HI> at <HI>Morocco,</HI> at <HI>Mequiness,</HI>
and other Cities, where they now carry on
a Commerce, by vast Annual Caravans.
They tell us, that it is already a very great
Trade; but how would our Proposal not
only encrease this Trade it self, but quite
change and alter the very people them∣selves,
while the North Part of the Coun∣try,
(being Christians,) the Savage Part
would be soon civiliz'd, and become so too,
and the People learn to live to be cloth'd,
and to be furnish'd with many Things from
<HI>Europe,</HI> which they now want; and by
Consequence would with their Manners
change the very Nature of their Commerce,
<PB N="338" REF="370"/>
and fall in upon the Consumption of the
European Manufactures.</P>
<P>IT would be needless to lay out Schemes
of Commerce among the Inhabitants of the
Nations within those southern Lands; Num∣bers
of European People being but once
settled on the Sea Coast, would soon spread
the Commerce into the inland Nations, and
employ and enrich the Inhabitants, by in∣structing
them in the Arts of living, as well
as of Trade; and this brings me to a View of
one of the greatest Scenes of Improvement in
the World, which is in short this, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>THAT there needs little more than to in∣struct
and inure the barbarous Nations in all
our Colonies, Factories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Arts of
Living; clothing with Decency, not shame∣less
and naked; feeding with Humanity, and
not in a Manner brutal; dwelling in Towns
and Cities, with Oeconomy and civil Go∣vernment,
and not like Savages.</P>
<P>IT is the most unaccountable Mistake of
its Kind that can be imagin'd, that one
should suppose civilizing Nations do not
encrease Commerce; the Contrary is evident,
in all our Colonies: Civilizing the <HI>American</HI>
Savages, who inhabited the Countries on the
Back of the <HI>European</HI> Colonies in <HI>North
America,</HI> as well our own, as those on the
<HI>French</HI> Side at <HI>Quebeck</HI> and <HI>Canada;</HI> what
has been the Consequence? Take it in the
following Particulars, which tho' few and
small in the several Articles, are yet consi∣derable
<PB N="339" REF="371"/>
in the whole, and abundantly con∣firm
the Proposition.</P>
<P>THE Indians or Natives, before the Euro∣peans
came among them, had neither Houses,
Cattle, Clothes, Tools, Weapons, Ammuni∣tion,
or Houshold Stuff; their Cattle were
the Beasts of the Forrest, their Clothes were
the Skins of Beasts, their Weapons Bows,
wooden Swords, Clubs, Javelins and Darts,
pointed with Teeth and Bones of Fishes,
their Ammunition Arrows and Stones, their
Houses meer Wigwams, Hovels and Huts,
their Houshold-stuff Earthen Pans hardned
in the Sun, their Beds Matts and Skins laid
on the Ground; they could strike no Fire,
but by rubbing two Sticks together; they
had neither edg'd Tools or other Tools, for
they had neither Iron, Steel, Brass or Lead;
no Grind stone or Mill-stone; their Meat
was Flesh dried in the Sun, and their Drink
no other than cold Water.</P>
<P>THE same Indians even those remaining
wild and savage almost as before; yet being
convinc'd by their Conveniencies, and promp∣ted
by Necessity, serve themselves of us with
an infinite Number of Things, for the abun∣dant
Accommodation of Life; and those that
are more civilized, do it more; and these al∣together
encrease our Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI>
take their own Goods first, with which they
purchase ours. They sell the Dear Skins, Bear
Skins, Fox, Beaver, and other Furrs; all
<PB N="340" REF="372"/>
which together (as is said above) our Mer∣chants
call <HI>Peltry:</HI> These I say they sell to
our People, and a very good Merchandize
they are, and make a good and great Return.</P>
<P>WITH these they buy our Woollen Ma∣nufactures
for their Clothing, such as Duf∣fels,
Blankets, Halfthicks, Kersies, and such
course Goods; and others also of Leather,
with which they dress and keep themselves
warm, in the coldest Season; also they buy
Caps, Stockings, Hats, Shoes, Gloves, for
the same hard Weather.</P>
<P>IN order to provide Fuel and Food, they
buy <HI>for the last</HI> Fire-Arms and Ammunition,
such as Powder and Shot, and <HI>for the first,</HI>
Hatchets and Axes, Knives, Bills, as also
Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and other Tools
fitted for their Work: For the building and
furnishing Houses to dwell in; they buy
all Kinds of edg'd Tools, as also Nails,
Spikes, Hammers, Saws, Chisels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
wrought Iron for Hooks, Hinges, Locks,
Bolts, and many other Things: For their
Houshold Stuff likewise they sometimes
buy Chairs, Stools, Benches, Beds, Bed∣steads,
and the like; also Pots, Casks, and
other Vessels of Earth, Pewter, Brass and
Wood, and in a Word every Thing they
want, which either Art or Trade can sup∣ply
them with.</P>
<P>ALL these make Trade, and as these De∣mands
encrease, the Trade and Commerce of
<HI>Europe</HI> must encrease; for Encrease of the
<PB N="341" REF="373"/>
Civiliz'd People is an Encrease of Com∣merce
in the Main, let the Degree of
their Demands be more or less.</P>
<P>WHAT then have the People of <HI>England</HI>
more to do, but to encrease the Colonies of
their own Nation in all the remote Parts,
where it is proper and practicable, and
to civilize and instruct the Savages and Na∣tives
of those Countries, wherever they
plant, so as to bring them by the softest
and gentlest Methods to fall into the
Customs and Usage of their own Country,
and incorporate among our People as one
Nation.</P>
<P>I say nothing of christianizing the Sa∣vages,
'tis remote from my present Pur∣pose;
and I doubt much more remote from
our practice, at least in most Places; but I
speak of an Incorporation of Customs and
Usages, as may in Time bring them to live
like Christians, whether they may turn
Christians or no.</P>
<P>TO bring this Home to the Coast and
Country of <HI>Africa,</HI> of which I was but
just now speaking; let them calculate the
Improvements proposed in Business, in Plan∣ting,
Fishing, Shipping, and all the neces∣sary
Employments that would attend a
publick improv'd Colony; and let them
tell me, if the Consequence would not be
a Consumption of Manufacture, among a
People where there was none before, and in a
<PB N="342" REF="374"/>
Place where we had no Commerce to carry
on before.</P>
<P>NOR let any weak-headed Christian sug∣gest,
that this would be to anticipate our
West India Trade, supplant our other Co∣lonies,
and weaken us on one Hand, while
it strengthens us on another; let those who
talk so, consider, <HI>1st</HI> the great Improve∣ments
proposed, without meddling either
with Sugar, Ginger, or any of our Island
Productions, and how great the Improve∣ment
might be first made in these Things.
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> Let me add, that as it is evident
all our Island Colonies are not at this Time
sufficient to supply our Markets with Su∣gar,
including the Quantity demanded for
Exportation, the Quantity cannot easily be
too great; nor indeed is there any Danger
of it; so that those phlegmatick Objecti∣ons
are easily to be answered, and need take
up no Room here: Let us see the Improve∣ment
begun, and let us see the Danger be∣gun,
of overcharging our Markets, and hur∣ting
the Trade of our Islands, and let us
hear if the Islands complain; it is then Time
enough to answer those Scruples, at present
I must acknowledge they merit no Con∣sideration.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, there is a vast Ocean
of Improvement in View upon the <HI>African</HI>
Coast, (tho' the single planting of Sugar
was omitted) and as there are as well on
this Side of the Country, as on the Eastern
<PB N="343" REF="375"/>
Shores, of which I come next to speak, vast∣ly
populous Nations, nay Empires, where
there are Millions of People yet to trade
with, who were never traded with before
the prevailing on these Nations to civilize
and govern themselves, according as in∣form'd
Nature would soon direct them,
would necessarily introduce Trade, consume
Manufacture, employ Shipping, employ
Hands, and in Time establish such a Com∣merce,
as would be more than equal to any
one foreign Exportation we have yet to
boast of.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a PROPOSAL for an Encrease and
Improvement of the British Commerce on
the East Coast of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is but one considerable Coun∣try
in the World that we have any
Knowledge of upon the Surface of the Globe,
to which the Inhabitants of <HI>Europe</HI> have no
Commerce, or with whom they have no
manner of Converse: And this is the great
Empire or Class of Kingdoms call'd <HI>Ethio∣pia</HI>
or the <HI>Ahyssines.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="376"/>
THERE are but three Ways for us to come
at any Part of this Country in a Course of
Trade or Correspondence, and at present
they are all made impracticable.</P>
<P>1. OVER Land from <HI>Tripoli</HI> and the
Coast of <HI>Barcan;</HI> and were the <HI>Tripolins</HI>
reduced, according to the Tenour of our
first Proposal, for rooting out those Ene∣mies
of fair Trade, the Rovers of <HI>Barbary,</HI>
this Trade would certainly be set on foot by
Caravans, as is done in <HI>Asia,</HI> from <HI>Aleppo</HI>
to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>2. UP the <HI>Nile</HI> from <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> into
the Lake of <HI>Dombea:</HI> But tho' this is said
to be in Use at some certain Times when
the River is not swell'd beyond its Bounds
and Banks; yet those that have examin'd it
more nicely, tell us, that those People are
mistaken, and that the Cataracts or Water-Falls,
which are frequent in the River, from
within 160 Miles of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> South, cut
off all Possibility of a Navigation, or of any
Commerce by Water farther that Way.</P>
<P>3. THE third Way is by the Coast of the
<HI>Red Sea;</HI> and this also is cut off, by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> who have seized upon all the West∣ern
Shores of the <HI>Gulph</HI> or <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and
driving the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> from the Coast,
have either shut all the Nations of the
World out from the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> or have
shut up the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> from conversing
with the rest of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="377"/>
THE Commerce however is apparently
practicable from the Coast of that <HI>Gulph,</HI>
farther South than the <HI>Turks</HI> have yet pos∣sess'd
it; and there are two particular Rivers
on that Coast, <HI>viz. Zeila</HI> and the <HI>Houache,</HI>
which I am assur'd, as well as I can be of
things which we have so little Intelligence
of, are navigable far in within the Country,
and beyond the Coast, which the <HI>Turks</HI> are
possess'd of; and that by these Rivers, a
Commerce may be established into the very
Centre of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> which is indeed the
richest and the most populous Part of it, and
that the Mouths of those Rivers are open
for any Nation to settle and fortify at;
which Settlements would be easily defend∣ed,
by having but two Ships of Force,
from 40 to 50 Guns, always there, by whom
also going and returning, the Trade would
be carry'd on round the Cape.</P>
<P>It may be suggested, that such a Trade
would be within the Circle of the <HI>East In∣dia</HI>
Company's Charter; to which it would
be effectually answer'd, Why then does not
the Company open the Trade, and make a
Settlement themselves? If they do not, no ex∣clusive
Privilege of Commerce is granted to
any Men, or Company of Men, to damn
or destroy a Trade, but to improve and
carry it on; and if they insist on their Char∣ter
to have the Right of Trading to <HI>Aethio∣pia,</HI>
but will not trade, their Right is so far
void of course; otherwise they may as well

<PB N="345" REF="379"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="346" REF="380"/>
tell us, they have a Charter granted them,
to shut out the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
from the <HI>Aethioprian</HI> Trade, which would
be absurd, and contrary to the Nature of
the Thing.</P>
<P>I need say no more to this Part, as to its
being practicable; I shall at any Time mark
out the Way, how to put it in Practice, and
to open the Commerce, and prove that the
<HI>Aethiopeans</HI> have, on many Occasions, shewed
themselves willing to embrace such a Pro∣posal;
it remains only, to shew a little
Sketch of the Trade it self, and the Im∣provement
which it might be to the Com∣merce
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>1. CONTRARY to the whole Tenor of
our Correspondence in the <HI>Indies,</HI> this
Trade would be exceeding much to the Ad∣vantage
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> because they
would both receive our Growth and Pro∣duce,
and make to us Returns in <HI>Specie;</HI>
whereas, in all the Trade of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Chi∣na</HI>
our Case is the reverse; for there we
cannot fell our own Goods at all, and cannot
buy theirs, but with ready Money. They
will take off none or but few of our Manu∣factures,
nor will they supply us with theirs,
but for hard Silver; to the exhausting, not
of <HI>England</HI> only, but even of all <HI>Europe,</HI>
of their ready Money.</P>
<P>2. The People, tho' the Country is hot, go
all modestly and decently cloathed; and 'tis
known by those who have travell'd among
<PB N="347" REF="381"/>
them, that they would buy our <HI>English</HI> fine
Cloths In particular, such as are carry'd to
<HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> if they could come at
them; and some Essays of that Kind have
been made from <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land, tho'
not such as are considerable enough to be
called a Trade.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, such a Trade would
be infinitely advantageous; seeing, the Re∣turn
for whatever of our Manufactures could
be sold there, would be in Gold, in Ivo∣ry,
Sulphur, Civet, Salt-Peter, Emralds,
and such like valuable Goods: There are o∣ther
Productions, which we have seen from
thence also, as Deer Skins in exceeding great
Quantities; Hides of black Cattle; Leo∣pards
and Lions Skins, and others of those
Kinds; also fine Copper, and some very
rich Gums and Drugs, of which I cannot
give the Names, except Frankincense, Gum-Arab.
and <HI>Aloes Socotrina.</HI> I have been
told of many others, but without Certainty
enough to affirm it.</P>
<P>IN Exchange for these, we should
without Fail introduce our broad Cloths,
fine Scarlet Shalloons, Sayes, Serges, and
such other thin Stuffs as are usually worn in
hot Climates; besides a great Quantity of
hard Ware Manufactures, wrought Iron
and Brass, edged Tools, Weapons, Fire-Arms,
Ammunition, Lead, Pewter, Tin,
line Linen, and perhaps Silks also; for
we are well assur'd they have no more Trade
<PB N="348" REF="382"/>
with <HI>India</HI> or any other Parts of the World
than they have with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THUS you have three great Articles for
the Improvement of the <HI>British</HI> Commerce
on the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> only, all practicable,
and all capable of raising an immense Con∣sumption
of our Woollen Manufactures,
where there was little or no Consumption
for them before: One of which Articles,
<HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Guinea,</HI> is actually in our own
Power, and so little to be said against the
Experiment, that nothing of its Kind is
more wonderful, than that it has never
yet been propos'd to the World, and the
Attempt not made.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a PROPOSAL for turning the whole
Trade for Naval Stores, Timber, Deals,
&amp;c. from the East Country, and from
Norway and Sweden, to our own Colo∣nies,
and yet without putting the Go∣vernment
of England to the dead Charge
of Bounty-Money on that Importation.</HEAD>
<P>A Fourth Improvement of Commerce
lyes also within our own Reach, and
some dull and weak, unperforming Steps
have been made, which looked as if we knew
<PB N="349" REF="383"/>
the Advantage of it; but I say, in so phleg∣matick
a Manner, as if, like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Slug∣gard,
<HI>we would not pluck our Hands out of
our Bosom to put them to our Mouths.</HI>
This is the transferring our Demand of Na∣val
Stores, Timber, Deals, Masts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
<HI>Norway, Sweden,</HI> and the East Country,
to our own Colonies in <HI>America;</HI> Coun∣tries,
without Exception, as able effectually
to supply us with Hemp, Flax, Tar,
Turpentine, all Kinds of Fir, Timber,
Deals, Pipe and Hogshead Staves, and per∣haps,
in Time, with Iron also, as all the
Nations mention'd above, and with proper
Encouragements, would soon produce them
all as cheap.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Attempts have, as I have
noted above, been made at this, as if we
own'd the Prospect of Advantage, but knew
not how to bring it to bear; all that has
hitherto been offer'd for the Encouragement
of this Commerce, and to make it practica∣ble,
has been that of a Bounty, to be paid in
<HI>England,</HI> upon the Importation, so to encou∣rage
the Merchant: But, with Submission,
this is not sufficient to make a Trade of it,
and is but upon one Species of the Goods
neither; whereas, the Encouragement must
be universal, if you expect the Trade shall
be so.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed upon this important
Article, which seems to have great Difficul∣ties
in it; which Difficulties yet I profess
<PB N="350" REF="384"/>
to remove, I must lay down one Founda∣tion;
which nevertheless, tho' I think 'tis
undoubted, yet we do take upon the Cre∣dit
of the Inhabitants of <HI>New England,</HI>
and the other Colonies on the North of
<HI>America;</HI> if they deceive us, they only
therein deceive themselves, and we are
where we were.</P>
<P>The fundamental is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That
they are able to furnish a sufficient Quanti∣ty
of Hemp, Flax, Tar, Turpentine, Fir,
Timber, Deal Boards, Masts, Yards, Pipes,
and Hogshead-Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fully to supply
the whole Demand of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> so as that we should suffer no
Scarcity, or want of those Goods, tho' we
should absolutely prohibit their Importati∣on
from any other Place.</P>
<P>BY being able to furnish, I am to be un∣derstood
thus; for I must not speak more
for them, than they speak for themselves;
and it is meet we should be very exact in
those Things we call first Principles: I say,
I am to be understood not that they have
Hands enough at present to fell and cut
out the Quantities of Timber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> draw
and extract the Tar and Turpentine, split
out the Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for that, I believe, at
first, would be a Difficulty, tho' it would
soon be master'd; but that the Country,
and the Woods, have a sufficient Quantity
of all these; that they are not to be plant∣ed,
or waited for till grown; but that they
<PB N="351" REF="385"/>
have a boundless Extent of Woods, as well
on the Hills as on the Plains, unexhausted,
and indeed, unexhaustible; which are suffi∣cient
for all our Demands, and much more.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE, I do not say, or insist, that
they do now produce or plant a sufficient
Quantity of Hemp and Flax to supply our
Demand; but that they have Land enough,
sufficient in Strength of Soil, and sufficient
in Quantity, and which by cutting down
the Woods, would daily encrease: This I
think is undoubted.</P>
<P>N. B. THE Countries where this Sup∣ply
of Timber and Naval-Stores would
be produced, is, in a Word, the whole
<HI>English</HI> Part of the Continent of
<HI>North-America,</HI> viz. <HI>New-England,
New-York, East</HI> and <HI>West Jersey, Pen∣sylvania,</HI>
and all the Country, whe∣ther
possess'd or no, upon the great
River of <HI>Delaware,</HI> as far as that
River is navigable, which may be for
ought we know 100 Miles beyond
<HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Ma∣ryland,</HI>
to the bottom of the Bay
of <HI>Cheseapeake,</HI> all the Colonies of
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> and all the
Rivers thereof; in which last Colony
alone, they tell us, there is as much
Fir-Timber growing, as in all the King∣dom
of <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="386"/>
LIKEWISE it is to be added, that <HI>muta∣tis
mutandis,</HI> the Coin, and Value of Pay∣ment
consider'd, they will be able to furnish
all these Things as cheap as the East Coun∣try
and <HI>Norway</HI> Trade does now furnish
them.</P>
<P>THESE Things granted, the Proposal is
brought into a narrow Compass; all the
Difference then between <HI>England</HI> (the Mar∣ket)
and our Colonies, the Producers of these
Goods, lies in the Price of the Freight,
occasion'd by the Distance of Place, and
Length of the Voyage; how to bring
this to a Par, is the whole of the Enqui∣ry:
And this is to be done by the several
Methods following.</P>
<P>N. B. Bounties and Payments of dead
Money to the Importer for Encourage∣ment,
I reject, as being a meer Charge
upon the Nation, tho' not upon the
particular Buyer of the Goods, and
is not by any Cleans to be called a
lessening the Disparity, only it re∣moves
the Burthen from private
Hands to the Publick, which is not
sufficient; and should it extend to all
the Importations, would be a Burden
too heavy to bear, even for the whole
Nation.</P>
<P>THE only Weight I would lay on the
Publick, and even that but for a while, is
to take off the Duties entirely from all those
Species of Goods, (not to repeat 'em) and
<PB N="353" REF="387"/>
prohibit the Importation from other Pla∣ces
and not this last Part neither, till the
Colonies were fully entered into the Trade.</P>
<P>THEN for the Freight; we are to sup∣pose,
that the Freight of all these Articles,
From the East and North Seas, stands now
at a Medium of forty to fifty Shillings <HI>per</HI>
Ton, call it more or less; and suppose the
Freight of the fame Goods from the Colo∣nies
should then stand at a Medium of six to
eight <HI>lib. per</HI> Ton; so that the Freight
would be three Times as much one way as
the other; 'tis true, this is a very considera∣ble
Article; and especially considering them
to be all bulky Goods also.</P>
<P>BUT two Articles will immediately con∣tribute
towards, if not be a full Equiva∣lent
to this Excess of Freight.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> TAKING off the Duty upon Im∣portation
here, which being very high,
suppose it, for Argument Sake, to be 20 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> may fairly be calculated at one half
of the difference, and must be found by
the Importer in the Price of his Goods at
Market.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> LAYING an Impost, suppose it
to be about ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon all the Im∣portations
of <HI>English</HI> Goods into those Co∣lonies,
and this I insist will be equal to
the other half: The Money so raised to be
paid to the Commanders of the Ships, in
such Proportions as shall be adjusted by the
<PB N="354" REF="388"/>
Publick, and upon so much Tonage only, as is
Loaden upon them of such particular Goods.</P>
<P>THE Colonies will never complain of
such a Duty, because 'tis in a manner paid
to themselves, and is but taking the Mo∣ney
out of one Pocket, and putting it in∣to
the other; the Growth of their Country
will be exported; (indeed the waste Growth,
for they burnt it all before) their own
People will be employ'd, and will be pro∣digiously
encreased, and these two are of
the last Importance to them; nay, they
are of such Importance to them, that give
them but an Assurance of these, they may
give you Assurance, that in a few Years
they will be the greatest, and most pros∣perous
Colonies in the World.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, I despise (with the utmost
Contempt of their Ignorance) the Sug∣gestions
of those Times, when this glori∣ous
Scheme of <HI>New-England</HI>'s Prosperity
was laid aside, (about two and forty Years
ago) from a pretended Jealousy of those
Colonies growing too powerful, and ma∣king
themselves independent; insinuating,
because they were independent in a religi∣ous
Profession, they wanted to be so in Go∣vernment;
whereas first, the very Thought,
besides a worse Principle it began in, <HI>viz.</HI>
of Party Malice, was to the last Degree
weak and foolish; since 'tis evident, the
Prosperity, and indeed, the very Being and
Subsistence of <HI>New-England</HI> in Matters of
<PB N="355" REF="389"/>
Trade, consists in, and depends wholly up∣on
their Union with, and Subjection to
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> as the Growth of their
Country, which is the only Article that
supports their Commerce, is taken off by
the <HI>British</HI> Colonies only: Nor can any
other Nation in Europe take it off but the
<HI>English; and the same of the rest:</HI> For
Example,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> have no Islands at all, but
one (remote and small) called <HI>Curacao,</HI> able
to do nothing worth the naming. The
<HI>French</HI> indeed have <HI>Martinico,</HI> a flourishing
Island Colony; but the Island is large, and
produces most of its own Provisions; and
if it did not, they have a Colony upon the
Main, <HI>viz. Canada,</HI> which supplies the
<HI>French</HI> at all their Islands with Provision,
such as Meal for Bread, Flesh, Fish, Peas,
and all other Provision that they can want;
and the <HI>French</HI> would never starve their
own Colony of <HI>Canada,</HI> to feed <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI>
But to make it unanswerable, if
the French would do their utmost, they
are not able to consume or take off, no
not one twentieth Part of the Growth of
our Colonies, who maintain, as some af∣firm,
1000 Sail of Ships and Sloops, con∣stantly
running with those Things from
the Main of <HI>North America</HI> to the Islands,
such as St. <HI>Christophers, Antegoa, Nevis,
Mountserrat, Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
the two last of which consume a prodigious
Quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="390"/>
THESE Provisions are the meer Growth of
the Country, such as Flour or Meal in Bar∣rels,
Peas, Malt, Rice and Tobacco; Beef
and Pork, pickled and barrelled; Sheep
and Horses alive; Beer in Casks and in
Bottles; white Fish salted and dry'd and
Salmon barrel'd; besides Lumber for build∣ing
and repairing, as well Houses as
Ships, and Ships and Sloops ready built and
finish'd.</P>
<P>THESE all are the Product of the Coun∣try,
and the Labour of the People in the
Colonies of <HI>New England, New York,</HI>
the two <HI>Jersies, Pensilvania, Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Carolina;</HI> without this Export, those Co∣loonies
would perish. It is true, the Islands
would starve for want of the Provisions
too, at least at first: But on the Conti∣nent,
if the Islands did not take off their
Product, their Lands which they have
been at a vast Expence to cure, and clear,
and plant, would lie useless and unculti∣vated;
the Swine which the Woods feed
for them by thousands, would overrun
them with their Multitude, and be worse
to them in Time, than the Bears and the
Wolves; their Plantations would produce
more of every Thing than their Mouths
could devour, or than they could find
Markets to vend them at; their Timber
would stand indeed where it was, for no
Body would fell it to have it, and they
<PB N="357" REF="391"/>
might set their Woods on Fire as they did
formerly, to clear the Land of them.</P>
<P>IN a Word, this being their Case, their
Interest ties them to <HI>England,</HI> tho' their
Duty should not, and to separate from
<HI>England,</HI> would be to be undone.</P>
<P>THEN carry the fame Argument on to
the proposed Commerce, for Timber, Na∣val
Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this would still the faster,
(if that were possible) bind them to their
Dependence on <HI>England,</HI> for no Nation in
Europe could give them the same En∣couragement:
I cannot enlarge upon this
Article here, it is evident to all that un∣derstand
Trade: If Courtiers and Statesmen
are ignorant, let them enquire where they
may be inform'd.</P>
<P>I return to the Proposal; having thus stated
the Equivalent, by which the Government
may be reimburst what they shall be out
of Pocket for the Experiment; it remains
only to give a brief Account of the Ad∣vantages
of such a Commerce; take them
in a few short Heads, for I cannot enlarge
them as I ought, for want of Room.</P>
<P>1. INSTEAD of the Trade for Deals and
Timber, Tar, Masts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we carry
on now with <HI>Norway,</HI> almost all for ready
Money, and which carries out more Silver
in Specie, nay, in our very Coin, Crowns
and half Crowns, than the <HI>East India</HI>
Company it self, however little Notice
has been taken of it: I say, instead of this
<PB N="358" REF="392"/>
disadvantageous Trade, we should then re∣ceive
all the same Goods in Exchange for
our own Manufactures, and they would be
purchased of, and produc'd by the La∣bour
of our own People, the industrious
Planters, Subjects to the Government of his
Majesty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>2. INSTEAD of having at least two
Thirds of these Goods brought over in
foreign Bottoms, <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
the Ships navigated by foreign Seamen, to
whom we pay dead Freight in the like ready
Money, and which they carry away in Spe∣cie,
as above; it would be wholly brought
to us in our own Ships, <HI>New England</HI>
built, and navigated wholly by our own
Seamen.</P>
<P>3. INSTEAD of a very few <HI>English</HI> Ships
which now use the Norway Trade, this
new Commerce would at least employ a
thousand Sail of Ships every Year, and all
the Year, and most of them Ships of Bur∣then:
So that besides the Benefit of build∣ing,
repairing, and fitting out so many
Ships, it would be a new Nursery of Sea∣men
to us, having always 15 to 20000
Seamen employ'd in it.</P>
<P>4. THE Colonies would be encreased in
People beyond expressing; and consequent∣ly,
not only the Consumption of Provisions
would be encreased there, which is, as be∣fore,
the grand Fund of their Prosperity;
but the Consumption of Manufactures,
<PB N="359" REF="393"/>
and all European Exportations to them,
would be in Proportion encreased, which
is the grand Subject of my Work. By
the Calculations which I have seen, it is
supposed, not less than to 100,000 Men
would be employ'd in the Woods, cutting
and felling Timber, Deals, Masts, Yards,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the managing and planting of Hemp
and Flax; in the extracting and drawing off
the Tar; and in preparing all the Articles
mentioned, to be fetch'd from thence, on
Account of this Trade; and this, besides
Women and Children, who could not do
much in that Part; and besides, the build∣ing
Ships among them, an Article so con∣siderable,
as well deserves to be handled by
it self.</P>
<P>5. IT would effectually furnish those
Colonies with Returns for <HI>England,</HI> which
they are now greatly distressed for, in or∣der
to pay the Ballance of their Trade with
<HI>England;</HI> the Quantity of our Manu∣factures
which they take off, infinitely ex∣ceeds
what they have of their own Growth
to send us in Return, whereas in Case of
such a Trade for the Produce of their
Country, they would be at about a PAR
with us, and we should always be able to
call for as much Goods from them, as
would pay our selves.</P>
<P>6. BY this Means they would receive
Silver in great Quantities from <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
and the other Islands, for all that Trade
<PB N="360" REF="394"/>
would be clear Gain to them, and that Sil∣ver
also would <HI>stay with them,</HI> which now
It cannot do, all being snatch'd up for
Returns to <HI>England</HI> in Specie, tho' it be
at 12 <HI>s.</HI> to 14 <HI>s. per</HI> Ounce: So that in
consequence of this Commerce, there
would be a Circulation of current Money
In the Colonies on the Continent, a Thing
they have of late been Strangers to.</P>
<P>IT would take up a Volume by it self,
to lay open all the glorious Schemes of
Improvement in Trade, which would be the
Consequence of such a Business, and parti∣cularly
the Encrease of our Manufacture
here, by the Demand of Goods from thence,
when the Numbers of People in those Co∣loonies
should be thus encreas'd; let any
one calculate (that is able to judge of these
Things) by what it is already, what it
must necessarily be on an Encrease of Peo∣ple:
Let them cast up the Exportations to
the five Colonies on the Continent; let
them consider those Exportations to be as
they really are, one entire Improvement,
derived from meer nothing, or next to
nothing in the last fourscore Years, for
then it was all an Embrio, and some of
them were nor in Being as to Trade (<HI>viz.)
New York</HI> and the <HI>Jersies</HI> conquered but
in 1666 from the <HI>Dutch, Pensylvania</HI> not
above 50 Years in Growth, <HI>Carolina</HI> less.</P>
<P>LET them tell us, or bat guess at for
us, what a glorious Trade to <HI>England</HI> it
<PB N="361" REF="395"/>
would be to have those Colonies encreased
with a Million of People, to be cloth'd,
furnish'd, and supply'd with all their need∣ful
Things, Food excepted, only from us;
and ty'd down for ever to us by that immor∣tal,
indissoluble Bond of Trade, <HI>their In∣terest.</HI></P>
<P>LET them consider, that all those People
must fetch from <HI>Great Britain</HI> only, their
Cloths, Woollen, Linnen, Cotton, and Silk;
all their Haberdashery; all their Manufac∣tures
of hard Ware, wrought Iron, Brass,
Chains, Edg'd Tools, Jack-work, Nails, Bolts,
Screws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all their heavy Ware, such as
cast Iron and Brass, Guns, Mortars, Shot,
Shells, Pots, Caldrons, Bells, Battery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
all their Clock-Work, Watch-Work, even so
much as their Toys and Trinkets; all their
House Furniture, Kitchen Furniture, Glass
Ware, Upholstery Ware, Tin Ware; in a
Word, every thing we produce, and every
thing we make, and every thing we import:
'T would be endless to repeat it.</P>
<P>HOW preposterous must those Notions be,
and how oddly must they think, if they can
be said to think at all, who suggest Mischief
from the Encrease of our Colonies! Do any
other Nations act thus? Do the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
think their Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,
Chili</HI> and St. <HI>Martha,</HI> too many and too
great, tho' a hundred Times as large as those
I am naming; and tho' they drein even
<HI>Spain</HI> itself of People? Are the <HI>French</HI> jea∣lous
<PB N="362" REF="396"/>
of the Number of their People in the vast
Countries of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Louisania?</HI> Do
they not study, by all Means possible, to en∣crease
them, and to extend their Plantations?</P>
<P>HAVE not we People enough to spare?
Do we not encrease till we are ready to eat
up one another, (I mean in Trade)? and
can we not spare enough of the unprofitable
Part of our People, those who are rather
said to starve among us than to live? Who,
if they were well settled there, would be
Industrious, Thrive, and grow Rich; and
'tis by the Industrious that Trade is support∣ed,
and Wealth encreased.</P>
<P>LET us no more amuse ourselves, and
raise the Vapours with our Phlegmatick
Thoughts about every little <HI>German</HI> En∣croachment
on our Manufactures, and the
Prohibitions of a few petty Princes in the
North. Here we can raise a Consumption
of our Manufactures, superior to all the Ob∣struction
they can give us: Here our Ma∣nufactures
will never be prohibited; here the
Demand will be for ever encreasing with the
People; 'tis like a Mill built by the Lord of
the Manor, it grinds for all his Tenants,
and is kept going by his own Stream; so that
on one hand it can never want Work, and
on the other hand can never want Water.</P>
<P>I have not Room to say more, tho' I
scarce know when to leave it off. I conclude
with telling you in a few Words, that here
is the greatest Opening for an Improvement
<PB N="363" REF="397"/>
of our Trade, and the easiest to put in
Practise, that ever was proposed, or perhaps
can be proposed to this Nation; and till we
go about it, we ought never to complain
of the Decay of our Trade, or of the want
of a Vent for our Manufactures.</P>
<P>THESE several Articles of the Improve∣ment
of our Commerce, have run out to
such an unavoidable Length, that I shall
not be able to add some others, which were
in my Design, and which are equally advan∣tageous
in Proportion to their Circumstan∣ces;
but I must touch lightly upon them,
and refer them to farther Occasion.</P>
<P>AS the Encrease of Commerce and People
in our Colonies, is, in Consequence of our
Property in them, an Encrease and Improve∣ment
of our Trade in <HI>England,</HI> and in par∣ticular
an Encrease of the Consumption of
our Manufactures; so it is a natural Infe∣rence,
and evident to Demonstration, that
an Encrease of Colonies must have the same
Effect.</P>
<P>I therefore lay it down as a Fundamental,
that additional Colonies, where the People
may plant and settle to their Advantage, is
a visible Improvement to our Trade.</P>
<P>EMPLOYMENT of our People, or as we
call them, our Poor, is the grand Support
of our very being as a Nation without it;
the Poor would eat us up, the Parish Rates
would in short devour not the Produce of
our Land only, but the Land itself; and the
<PB N="364" REF="398"/>
Church-Wardens would call upon you for
20 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound for your Beggars.</P>
<P>THIS employing of the Poor is the Effect
of our Manufactures; the Magnitude of which
is, for that very Reason, already described;
but as our Manufactures employ the Poor,
so Trade carries off the Manufactures, or
else they would soon over-run the Con∣sumption,
and come to a full Stop: The
Manufactures support the Poor, Foreign
Commerce supports the Manufactures, and
planting Colonies supports the Commerce.</P>
<P>HERE you dispose of your encreasing
Numbers of Poor; they go there poor, and
come back rich; there they plant, trade,
thrive, and encrease; even your transported
Felons, sent to <HI>Virginia</HI> instead of <HI>Tyburn;</HI>
Thousands of them, if we are not misin∣form'd,
have, by turning their Hands to In∣dustry
and Improvement, and, which is best
of all, to Honesty, become rich substantial
Planters and Merchants, settled large Fami∣lies,
and been famous in the Country; nay,
Ave have seen many of them made Magi∣strates,
Officers of Militia, Captains of the
good Ships, and Matters of good Estates.</P>
<P>THIS Way therefore, I say, we dispose of
the growing Numbers of our Poor to an in∣expressible
Advantage, as well a publick as
a private Advantage: It is a private Advan∣tage,
as 'tis really a Benefit to the Poor that
go, (for pray take me, as I ought to be taken)
When I say go, I am to be understood that
<PB N="365" REF="399"/>
I mean go freely and voluntarily. I am not
moving you to transport the Poor, that
would be sending them away because they
are poor; but those who being destitute of
Employment here, are willing to seek it A∣broad,
would have a visible Advantage, and
would soon give Encouragement to others
to follow them, and Thousands of such Fa∣milies
would raise themselves there by their
Industry, and grow rich; for where Wages
is high, and Provisions low, as is the Case
there, the Labourer must be idle, or extra∣vagant,
or thriving, and grow rich; and
the Consequence of the diligent labouring
Man there, is always this, that from a meer
Labourer he becomes a Planter, and settles
his Family upon the Land he gains, and so
grows rich of Course.</P>
<P>THE Advantage to the Publick I have
spoken of, tho' but briefly. I only add
here, That besides the Encrease of Com∣merce
and People, it necessarily makes an
Encrease of Seamen, a Point just now upon
the Anvil of the State, and which they find
hard enough for the hammering of all the po∣litical
Smiths of the Nation; all this growing
Commerce, to and from our Colonies, must
be carry'd on by Sea; all the Commerce they
can have there, one Colony with another,
must be the same: The first by large Ships
of Force, the last by Sloops, Ketches, and
small Ships. The Encrease of the People en∣creases
the Trade, the Encrease of the Trade
<PB N="366" REF="400"/>
encreases the Number of Ships, and the En∣crease
of Ships calls for an Encrease of Sea∣men:
Thus your Strength, as well as Wealth,
grows with your Colonies, the Climax is
really pleasant to look upon.</P>
<P>MORE Colonies then is, without Question,
extending the Commerce; it is enlarging
the Field of Action; it calls in more Hands
to assist in the Publick Prosperity; it em∣ploys
profitably the unprofitable Numbers
of your Poor, and lays a Foundation of an
extended Trade, and thereby of a still larger
Exportation from Home.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE I should propose a Place in the
World, where, if the <HI>English</HI> could plant at
this Time any Numbers of their People, even
the poorest and meanest, supposing them on∣ly
to be industrious, and willing to live;
for I am not talking of Drones, and <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>'s
Sluggards, that will starve rather than
work; or, as I have said above, will not
pull their Hand out of their Bosom to put
it to their Mouth. Such will starve every
where, and may as well stay at Home as go
Abroad: Such will not sow, and how should
they reap? will not plant, and how should
they eat?</P>
<P>BUT suppose, I say, a Spot of Ground,
where a Body of <HI>English</HI> People being plant∣ed,
the Country, by its own native Pro∣duction
of Corn and Cattle, would imme∣diately
subsist them; and the being placed in
a Situation to live and trade, they should
<PB N="367" REF="401"/>
want no other Support from hence, but their
first carrying over, and the Subsistence of the
first Year, till a Harvest supply'd them: Sup∣pose
them what Number you please, from
one Thousand to an Hundred Thousand, or
suppose them encreased from the one Num∣ber
to the other: Grant me but that they
wear Cloths, build, furnish Houses as they
encrease, and that they gain enough to pro∣vide
necessary Things for themselves; Is not
the Supply of these, all Gain to us? Is not
all they take an Encrease of the Consumption
of our Manufactures and Produce? Is not
every Ship employed between us and them,
so far an Encrease of Navigation? and so of
all the rest: An Encrease of Colonies en∣creases
People, People encrease the Con∣sumption
of Manufactures, Manufactures
Trade, Trade Navigation, Navigation Sea∣men,
and altogether encrease the Wealth,
Strength, and Prosperity of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT where in the World should we plant?
what Country presents for new Colonies, at
least that is not possess'd or claimed by some
other Nation? and where can we find a
Place, where, with the Settlement of the
People, a Trade will follow? and from
whence they can, besides subsisting plenti∣fully
in that Place, find Returns to <HI>Europe,</HI>
to purchase from us the Manufactures they
want? My Answer is, that if I do not find
out such Places, I have been saying nothing
all this while: That there is Room enough
<PB N="368" REF="402"/>
still left on the Surface of the Globe, not taken
up nor claim'd, or pretended to by <HI>Spaniards,
Portuguese, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French, Dane</HI> or
<HI>Swede, Pope</HI> or <HI>Devil;</HI> Places where 100000
People may immediately plant and build,
find Food, and subsist plentifully,; the Soil
fruitful, the Climate comfortable, the Air
healthy, unmolested by Savages and Canibals,
as in <HI>North America;</HI> unravaged by Lions
and Tygers, Elephants and Monsters, as
in <HI>Africa;</HI> fill'd with Cattle useful and
eatable, tame and tractable, abounding
with Fish, Fowl, Flesh, wanting nothing
but to be inhabited by Christians, and
ally'd to the rest of the Christian World by
Commerce and Navigation.</P>
<P>BUT I am too near the End of this Work
to enter upon so large a Subject: It must be
treated of by itself.</P>
