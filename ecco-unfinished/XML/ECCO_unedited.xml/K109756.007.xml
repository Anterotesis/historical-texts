Pliny terms it <HI>Picus Arborarius.</HI> The Hebrew name is <HI>Anapha,</HI> and according to others, <HI>Bleschiat.</HI> In Italian <HI>Pico,</HI> or <HI>Picchio.</HI> In German <HI>Specht.</HI> In Flemish <HI>Spicht.</HI> In Spanish <HI>Beguebo.</HI> In Pólish <HI>Dzieziol.</HI> In Turkish <HI>Saegarieck.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Les Pics.</HI> Buff. <HI>Pici.</HI> Linnaeus, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals alone, which live upon the fruits of the earth, join in society. Nature entertains them with a perpetual banquet, and abundance begets those gentle peaceful dispositions which are fitted for social intercourse. Other animals are con∣stantly engaged in the pursuit of prey;
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
urged by want, restrained by apprehensions of danger, they depend for subsistence on the vigour of their own exertions: they have scarce time to satisfy their immediate desires, and no leisure to cherish the bene∣volent affections. Such is the solitary con∣dition of all the carnivorous birds, except a few cowardly tribes which prowl on putrid carrion, and rather combine like robbers, than unite as friends.</P>
<P>And of all the birds which earn their subsistence by spoil, none leads a life so laborious and so painful as the Woodpecker. Nature has condemned it to incessant toil and slavery. While others freely employ their courage or address, and either shoot on rapid wing, or lurk in close ambush; the Woodpecker is constrained to drag out an insipid existence in boring the bark and hard fibres of trees, to extract its humble prey. Necessity never suffers any inter∣mission of its labours; never grants an interval of sound repose: often during the night it sleeps in the same painful posture as in the fatigues of the day. It never shares the cheerful sports of the other in∣habitants of the air: it joins not their vocal concerts, and its wild cries, and saddening tones, while they disturb the silence of the forest, express constraint and effort. Its
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
movements are quick; its gestures, full of inquietude; its looks, coarse and vulgar; it shuns all society, even that of its own kind; and when it is prompted by lust to seek a companion, its appetite is not soft∣ened by delicacy of feeling.</P>
<P>Such is the narrow and gross instinct suited to a mean and a gloomy life. The organs with which the Woodpecker is fur∣nished, correspond to its destination. Four thick nervous toes, two turned forwards, and two backwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, the one resembling a spur, being longest and stoutest; all of them armed with thick hooked nails, con∣nected to a very short and extremely mus∣cular foot, enable the bird to cling firmly, and to creep in all directions on the trunks of trees <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle. <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 9.</NOTE>. Its bill is edged, straight, wedge∣shaped, square at the base, channelled long∣wise, flat, and cut vertical at its tip like a chisel: this is the instrument with which it pierces the bark, and bores into the wood, to extract the insects, or their eggs. The substance of the bill is hard and solid <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Belon and Aristotle.</NOTE>, and rises out of the cranium, which is very thick. Powerful muscles act upon its short neck, and direct its incessant blows, which
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
sometimes penetrate even to the pith of the wood. It darts its long tongue, which is tapered and rounded like an earth-worm, and tipt with a hard bony point, like a needle. Its tail consists of ten stiff quills, bent inwards, truncated at the ends, beset with hard bristles; and this often serves it as a rest, while employed in a constrained, and often inverted, posture. It breeds in the cavities which it has in part formed itself; the progeny issue from the heart of the tree, and, though furnished with wings, they are almost confined to the verge of its circumference, and condemned to tread the dull round of life.</P>
<P>The genus of the Woodpecker contains a great number of species, which differ in size and in colours. The largest is equal in bulk to the crow; and the smallest ex∣ceeds not the titmouse. But few individuals are included in each species; which must ever be the case where a laborious course of life checks multiplication. Yet nature has placed Woodpeckers in all countries where she has planted trees, and in greater plenty in the warm climates. There are only twelve species in Europe, and in the arctic regions; but we may reckon twenty-seven from the hot countries of America, of Africa, and of Asia. And thus, though
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
we have considerably abridged the number, thirty-nine species still remain; sixteen of which were hitherto unknown.—We may observe in general, that the Woodpeckers of either continent differ from other birds in the shape of the feathers of the tail, which terminate in a point more or less sharp.</P>
<P>The three species of Woodpeckers known in Europe are <HI>the Green, the Black, and the Variegated.</HI> These have no varieties in our climates, and would seem to have migrated from the parent families in both continents. After these European ones, we shall range the foreign Woodpeckers akin to them.</P>

<P>THIS is the best known, and the most common of the Woodpeckers. It ar∣rives in the spring, and makes the forests resound with the shrill harsh cries <HI>tiacacan, tiacacan,</HI> which are heard at a great distance. These sounds are uttered chiefly when it bounds in the air, sinking, and again rising by starts, and describing its waved tracks; but though it mounts only to a small height, it can fly from wood to wood. In the pair∣ing season, it has, besides its ordinary cry, a call of courtship, which resembles in some measure a loud continued burst of laughter <HI>tio tio, tio, tio, tio,</HI> repeated thirty or forty times in succession <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus says, that it is silent in summer; pro∣bably it resumes its cry in autumn, for in that season we have heard it make the woods to resound.</NOTE></P>

The Green-Woodpecker is seen oftener on the ground <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE> than the other Woodpeck∣ers, particularly near ant-hills, where we may be sure to find it, and even to catch it by means of a noose. It inserts its long tongue into the narrow hole, through which the ants commonly issue, and as soon as it feels the tip covered with these insects, it withdraws, and swallows them. But when these little republicans are inactive and still, or torpid with cold, the bird assaults their citadel, and, employing both feet and bill, soon makes a breach, and at ease de∣vours them, and their chrysalids.</P>
<P>At other times it creeps against the trees, which it strikes with incessant blows; and, labouring with the most strenuous activity, it often strips them of all their bark. The strokes of its bill are audible at a distance, and may be distinctly counted. In other respects it is indolent, and will suffer a person to approach near it, and will endea∣vour only to conceal itself from the sports∣man, by warping round the branch, and clinging on the opposite side. It has been said, that, after a few knocks, it removes to another part of the tree to observe if it has pierced it; but its view rather to
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
gather on the bark the insects which it has roused and put in motion: and, what is more certain, it judges from the sound of the blow in what cranies the worms are lodged, or where there is a proper cavity for its own accommodation.</P>
<P>It usually forms its nest in the heart of some worm-eaten tree, at the height of fif∣teen or twenty feet above the ground, and oftenest in the softer kinds of wood, the aspin, or the willow, rather than the oak. Both male and female, by turns, labour incessantly in boring the fresh part of the timber, until they penetrate to the rotten center. Then they fashion and enlarge the cavity, and throw out with their feet the chips and wood dust: sometimes they make the hole so deep and crooked, that the light cannot enter, and they rear their young in the dark. They commonly lay five eggs, which are greenish, with small black spots. The infant brood begin to creep before they are able to fly. The parents seldom leave them; they roost very early, and re∣pose in their holes till day.</P>
<P>Some naturalists have thought the Green-Woodpecker was the rain-bird of the an∣cients, <HI>pluviae avis,</HI> because it is generally believed to foretell rain by an unusual cry, which is drawling and plaintive, <HI>pheu, pheu,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
<HI>pheu,</HI> and may be heard at a very consider∣able distance. Hence the English call it <HI>rain-fowl,</HI> and some provinces of France, such as Burgundy, it is vulgarly termed <HI>the miller's procurer (procureur du meunier).</HI> These observers allege, that as this bird shews a foresight of the state of the atmo∣sphere, superstition would naturally ascribe to it a more profound and wonderful saga∣city. The Woodpecker held a principal rank among the auspices <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pici Martii... in auspicatu magni... principalis Latio sunt in auguriis.</HI> Plin. <HI>Lib. x.</HI> 18.</NOTE>; its history or fable was interwoven with the mythology of the ancient heroes of <HI>Latium</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Picus, son of Saturn, and father of Faunus, was grand∣father of king Latinus.

The species of the Green Woodpecker is found in both continents; and, though it contains few individuals, they are widely spread. The Green Woodpecker of Louisi∣ana is the same with that of Europe <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Dupratz.</NOTE>; and that of the Antilles is only a variety <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">There is a bird called <HI>carpenter</HI> in St. Domingo, no doubt, because it shapes and hollows trees; if it be not the Green Woodpecker of Europe, it is a bird of the same species; it has its colours, its form, its note, and its habits. It does much injury to the palm trees, which it bores in many places, and often quite through, which makes them frail and perishable. It is also very fond of the cocoa nut. We are obliged to hunt it when that fruit comes to maturity. <HI>Note of the Chevalier Lefebvre Deshayes.</HI></NOTE>. Gmelin mentions his having seen, among the Tunguse Tartars, a cinereous Green Woodpecker, which must be akin to the European <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tunguses of Nijaia-tunguoka ascribe virtues to the cinereous Green Woodpecker; they roast this bird, pound it, mix it with any sort of fat, except that of bears, because this quickly grows rancid, and with this compound besmear the arrows which they use in the chace: an animal struck with one of these arrows, instantly falls. <HI>Voyage en Siberie,</HI> par Gmelin, tom.

In fact, the only difference between it and our Green Woodpecker, is, that its plumage is paler, and its head not marked with bright red, though there is a tint of that colour on the front.

Its size and almost its colours, are the same; and Aldrovandus formed his description from a figure exhibited at Venice; and such slender authority merits no attention.</P>
<P>Belon conceived the black Woodpecker to be a species of the Green Woodpecker; and this error has been adopted by Ray, who reckons two kinds of Green Woodpeckers. These oversights are occasioned by the mis∣application of terms: such has also been the case with the appellation <HI>picus martius,</HI> which is often bestowed on the Woodpeckers
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
in general, though originally it belonged exclusively to the Green Woodpecker.</P>
<P>Gesner has asserted, and Aldrovandus has endeavoured to prove, that the <HI>Colios</HI> of Aristotle was the Green Woodpecker: but almost all other naturalists have maintained that it was the Oriole. It may therefore be proper to discuss these opinions, both with a view to complete the history of these birds, and to elucidate two difficult passages in Aristotle.</P>
<P>In Theodore Gaza's edition of Aristotle, the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which he translates <HI>Galgulus,</HI> or Oriole, occurs twice in the same chapter, It is first represented as hostile to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and then as associating with that bird, and haunting the sides of rivers and bushes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> denotes a thicket proper for an ambuscade.</NOTE>: that sort of life is not ascribed to the for∣mer, which to avoid confusion ought to be read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And what Aristotle mentions in another passage <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii. 3.</NOTE>, when he treats more fully of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Observe, that he comprehends under the article birds that live upon insects and goats.</NOTE>; that they are nearly as large as the turtle, that their voice is strong, &amp;c. agrees perfectly with the character of the Green Woodpecker: but it has besides a
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
property peculiar to itself, <HI>that it eagerly bores the trees, and procures its subsistence from the rotten parts.</HI> The epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> too, which Aristotle bestows, signifies <HI>green,</HI> not yellow, as Gaza renders it; and when we consider that the antient philosopher ranges the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> after two Woodpeckers and before the creeper, we cannot for a moment doubt, but that he means by it the Green Wood∣pecker.</P>
<P>Albertus and Scaliger were assured that the Green Woodpecker could learn to speak, and that it sometimes pronounces words distinctly: Willughby justly disbelieves it. The structure of its tongue, which is long and worm-shaped, appears entirely unfit to articulate sounds; and its wild intract∣able nature cannot submit to education: for how could a bird be trained in the domestic state, which lives only upon the insects that lurk under the bark of trees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Viscount de Querhoent assures us, however, that he kept them at least for some time; but he confirms us in the idea of their untractable disposition. I have seen, says he, young Green Woodpeckers which I was rearing, and which were still in the nest, fight with each other obstinately. When I opened trees where was a brood, the parents con∣stantly forsook them, and left them to perish of hunger. The woodpeckers are vicious and quarrelsome; birds weaker than them are ever their victims; they break the scull with their bill, without afterwards preying on it. I had one in a room with partridges, and it killed them all one after another. When I entered, it climbed up my legs. It walked out into the fields, and returned to eat in its room. They are very familiar, but feel no attachment.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28"/>
According to Frisch, the males alone have red on the head; and Klein makes the same assertion. Salerne says, that they were mistaken, and that the young ones have all the upper side of the head red, even in the nest. According to the obser∣vation of Linnaeus, this red varies, and appears mixed sometimes with black spots, and sometimes with grey ones, and, in a few instances, without any spots at all. Some individuals, which are probably old males, assume a red tint on the two black mustachoes which arise from the corners of the bill, and their colours are in general more vivid.</P>
<P>Frisch relates, that in Germany dur∣ing winter, the Green Woodpeckers plun∣der bee-hives. We doubt this fact, espe∣cially as in France few or none of these birds remain through the inclement season, and it is unlikely that the colder climate of Germany should prove more inviting.</P>
<P>When we dissect them, we commonly find the crop filled with ants. They have no <HI>coecum,</HI> which is wanting equally in all birds of this kind; but instead of it there
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
is a dilatation of the intestine. The gall∣bladder is large; the alimentary canal two feet long; the right testicle round, the left one oblong and arched, which is the natural structure, since it was verified on a great number of subjects <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the mechanism of the tongue has been a subject of admiration among all naturalists. Borelli and Aldrovandus have described the form and functions of that organ: <HI>Olaus Jacobaeus,</HI> in the Acts of Copenhagen, and Mery, in the Memoires of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, have delineated its curious anatomy. The tongue of the Green Woodpecker is, accurately speaking, only the bony tip, and what is usually taken for the tongue is the <HI>os hyöides</HI> invested with a membranous coat, and ex∣tending backwards into two long branches, at first osseous, and afterwards cartilagi∣nous: these, after encircling the windpipe, reflect towards the head, and running close in a furrow along the skull, they are in∣serted on the forehead at the root of the bill. They are elastic cords, furnished with an apparatus of muscles, both <HI>extensors</HI> and <HI>retractors,</HI> which serve to move and direct this sort of tongue. The whole is sheathed
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
by the prolongation of the skin, which lines the lower mandible, and which extends when the <HI>os hyöides</HI> is protruded, and col∣lapses, in annular wrinkles, as that bone is retracted. The bony tip, which is the real tongue, is connected to the extremity, and covered with a scaly horn, beset with small hooks bent back: and that it may be capable both to hold and to pierce its prey, it is naturally moistened with a viscous fluid, that distills from two excretory ducts which rise from a double gland.—After this struc∣ture the tongue of all the Woodpeckers is fashioned; indeed we might conclude from analogy, that it also obtains in such birds in general, as protrude their tongue by extending it.</P>
<P>The Green Woodpecker has a very large head, and can bristle the red feathers that cover its crown, which induced Pliny to term it tufted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cirrhas pico martio.</NOTE>. It is sometimes caught by the decoy, but very rarely: it answers not the call so much as the noise made by striking the tree where it lodges, and which resembles that usually occasioned by its own boring. Sometimes it is seized by the neck in springs, as it creeps along the stake. But it is very coarse food, and always ex∣ceedingly
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
lean and dry; though Aldrovan∣dus says, that these birds are eaten in win∣ter at Bologna, and are then pretty fat: this acquaints us, at least, that they remain during that season in Italy, while they dis∣appear in France <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Picus Viridis:</HI> it is green, its head crimson.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The Yellow WOODPECKER of Cayenne. <HI>Fifth Species. Picus Exalbidus.</HI> Gmel. <HI>Picus Cayanensis Albus.</HI> Briss. <HI>Picus Flavicans.</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE birds, which are enamoured of the solitude of the desert, have mul∣tiplied in the vast forests of the new world, and the more so, as there man has yet encroached little on the antient domains of nature. We have received ten species of Woodpeckers from Guiana, and the Yellow Woodpeckers seem peculiar to that country. Most of these are scarcely known to natu∣ralists, and Barrere has only noticed a few. The first species is described by Brisson under the name of <HI>White Woodpecker</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Picus Cayanensis Albus.</HI> Briss.</P>
<P>Thus described: "it is dirty-white; a red longitudinal bar on either side upon the lower jaw; its tail-quills black∣ish."</P></NOTE>: its plumage is of a soft yellow; the tail black; the great quills of the wing brown, and the middle ones rufous; the coverts of the
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
wings are brown gray, fringed with yellow∣ish white. It has a crest which reaches to its neck, and which, as well as the whole of the head, being pale yellow, is strongly contrasted with its red mustachoes; its ap∣pearance is thus remarkable, and the soft un∣common colour of its plumage distinguishes it from the rest of its genus. The creoles of Cayenne call it the <HI>Yellow Carpenter.</HI> It is smaller than the Green Woodpecker, and much more slender; its length nine inches. It forms its nest in large trees, rotten at the core; after it has bored hori∣zontally to the decayed part, it descends, and continues the excavation to the depth of a foot and a half. The female lays three eggs, which are white, and almost round; and the young are hatched in the beginning of April. The male shares the female's solicitude, and, during her absence, he plants himself in the entrance. His cry is a whistle composed of six notes, the first of which are monotonous, and the two or three last flatter. The female has not the bright red bar which appears in the male on each side of the head.</P>
<P>There is some variety in this species, certain individuals having all the small coverts of the wings of a fine yellow, and
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
the great ones edged with that colour; in others, such as that probably which Brisson described, the whole plumage is discoloured and bleached, so as to appear only a dirty white or yellowish.</P>

<P>AFINE bright red, which is brilliant and golden, forms the superb attire of this bird. It is almost as large as the Green Woodpecker, but not so stout. A long yellow crest in pendulous filaments covers the head, and falls backwards; from the corners of the bill, rise two mustachoes of a fine light red, traced nicely between the eye and the throat; some white and citron spots embellish and variegate the rufous ground of the middle of the upper surface; the rump is yellow, and the tail black. The female, both of this species, and of the Yellow Woodpecker which comes from the same country, has no red on the cheeks.</P>

<P>THIS is also one of the Yellow <HI>Carpen∣ters</HI> of Cayenne. It has a fine black horse-shoe, which meets the neck behind, covers all the forepart like a cravat, and falls on the breast; the rest of the under∣side of the body is rusty fulvous, and also the throat and the whole head, whose crest extends to the neck; the back is of a bright rufous; the wing is of the same co∣lour, but the quills crossed with a few black streaks pretty much asunder, and some of these extend to the tail, which has a black tip. This Cayenne bird is as large as the Yellow Woodpecker, or even the Ferruginous Woodpecker: all the three are alike slender, and similarly crested.

<HEAD>The RUFOUS WOODPECKER. <HI>Eighth Species. Picus Rufus.</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THE plumage of this little Woodpecker has a singular property, viz. the un∣der side of its body is of a deeper hue than the upper, contrary to what is observed in all other birds. The ground colour is rufous, of various intensity; deep on the wings; more dilute on the rump and back, more charged on the breast and belly, and mingled, on all the body, with black waves, which are very crowded, and which have the effect of the most beautiful enamel: the head is rufous, embellished and crossed by small black waves. This Woodpecker, which is found in Cayenne, is scarcely larger than the Wryneck, but it is rather thicker: its plumage, though it consists of

The ground colour of is plumage is brown tinged with olive, and having white spots or scales on the fore∣part of the body, and under the neck, which is spread with a fine yellow that stretches under the eye, and on the top of the neck; a red hood covers the crown of the head, and a mustachoe of that colour diluted rises from the corners of the bill.

<P>THIS bird, as small as the gold crested wren, is the dwarf of the large family of Woodpeckers. It is not a creeper, and its straight square bill shews it to be a real Woodpecker. Its neck and breast are waved distinctly with black and white zones; its back is brown, spotted with white drops, and shaded with black; the same spots, only closer and finer marked, appear on the beautiful black that covers the arch of the neck; and lastly, a little gold head makes it look as handsome, as it is delicate. This little bird, at least if we judge from the stuffed specimen, must be more sprightly and agile than any of the other Woodpeck∣ers; and nature would seem to have thus compensated for its smallness. It is often found in company with the creepers, and

<P>THOUGH I place this beautiful bird in the close of the family of the Green Woodpecker, I must remark, that it seems to emerge from even the genus of the Woodpeckers, both by its habits and some of its features. Catesby, who observed it in Carolina, tells us, that it is oftenest on the ground, and does not creep upon the trunks of trees, but perches on their branches like other birds. Yet its toes are disposed two before, and two behind, like the Woodpeckers; and, like them too, the feathers of its tail are stiff and hard; and, what is peculiar to itself, the side of each is terminated by two small filaments. Its
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
bill is, however, dissimilar to that of the Woodpeckers; it is not squared, but round∣ed, and somewhat curved, pointed, and not formed into an edge. If this bird resembles then the Woodpeckers in the structure of its feet and tail, it differs in the shape of the bill, and in its habitudes, which neces∣sarily result from the conformation of that principal organ in birds. It seems to form an intermediate species between the Wood∣peckers and the Cuckoos, with which some naturalists have ranged it; and it furnishes another example of those shades by which nature connects her various productions. It is about the size of the Green Wood∣pecker, and is remarkable for its beautiful form, and the elegant disposition of its rich colours; black spots, like crescents and hearts, are scattered on the stomach and belly on a white ground of a dingy cast; the forepart of the neck is vinous cinereous or lilack, and, on the middle of the breast, there is a broad black zone, shaped like a crescent; the rump is white; the tail black above, and lined below with a fine yellow resembling dead leaves; the upper side of the head, and the top of the neck, are of a lead gray, and the back of the head is marked with a fine scarlet spot; from the corners of the bill two large black musta∣choes

take their origin, and descend on the sides of the neck, and they are wanting in the female; the back is of a brown ground, with black streaks; the great quills of the wing are of the same cast; but what deco∣rates it, and suffices alone to discriminate the bird, the shafts of all these quills are of a gold colour. It is found in Canada and Virginia, as well as in Carolina <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Picus Auratus:</HI> "It is streaked transversely with gray and black, its throat and breast are black, its nape red, its rump white."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS second species of European Wood∣pecker appears to be confined to some particular countries, and especially to Ger∣many. However, the Greeks, as well as
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
we, were acquainted with three species of Woodpeckers, and Aristotle mentions them all <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 9.</NOTE>: The first, says he, is smaller than the Blackbird, and is our variegated Wood∣pecker; the second is larger than the Blackbird, and is the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or our Green Woodpecker <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id.</HI> Lib. viii. 3.</NOTE>; and the third, he repre∣sents as equal in size to a hen, which must be understood of its length, and not of its thickness; and it is therefore our Black Woodpecker, the largest of all the Wood∣peckers of the antient continent. It is sixteen inches long, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail; the bill mea∣sures two inches and a half, and is of a horn colour; a bright red hood covers the crown of the head; the plumage of the whole body is deep black. The German names <HI>Krähe-specht</HI> and <HI>Holtz-krahe,</HI> crow spight and woodcrow, mark both its colour and its size.</P>
<P>It is found in the tall forests on the mountains of Germany, in Switzerland, and in the Vosges: it is unknown in most of the provinces of France <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><Q>“”The Black Woodpecker is not found in Normandy? nor in the vicinity of Paris, nor in the Orleanois.</Q> <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>, and seldom de∣scends into the low country. Willughby
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
assures us, that it never occurs in England; and indeed that country is too open for a bird of such a nature, and for the same reason, it has deserted Holland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>: And this is evidently not on account of the cold of those regions, since it inhabits the forests of Sweden <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI> No. 79.</NOTE>. But it is difficult to imagine why it is not found in Italy, as Aldro∣vandus asserts.</P>
<P>Even in the same country, these birds prefer particular districts that are solitary and wild; Frisch mentions a forest in Fran∣conia <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The forest of Spessert.</NOTE>, noted for the multitude of Black Woodpeckers which it contains. In gene∣ral, the species is not numerous; and, in the extent of half a league, we can sel∣dom find more than a single pair. They settle in a certain spot, which they scarce ever leave.</P>
<P>This bird strikes the trees with such force, that according to Frisch, it may be heard as far as a hatchet. It bores to the heart of the trunk, and forms a very capacious cavity; as much as a bushel of wood-dust and chips is often seen on the ground below its hole; and sometimes it hollows out the substance of the trees to such a degree that they are soon borne
<PB N="44" REF="59"/>
down by the wind <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 9.</NOTE>. They prefer the de∣cayed trees, but, as they also attack those which are sound, the careful proprietors of woods are at pains to destroy them. M. Deslandes, in his Essay on the Ship-Build∣ing of the Ancients, regrets, that there are few trees fit for making oars forty feet long, which are not bored by the Woodpeckers <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">But M. Deslandes is much mistaken in the same place, when he says that this Woodpecker employs its tongue like an augre to bore the largest trees.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Black Woodpecker lays, in the bot∣tom of its hole <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny has asserted with too great latitude that the Woodpeckers are the only birds which breed in hollow trees (Lib. x. 18); many other small birds, such as the Titmice, do the same.</NOTE>, two or three eggs, which are white; as in all birds of the genus, according to Willughby: It seldom alights on the ground; the ancients affirmed even, that no Woodpecker ever descends from its tree <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle. <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 9.</NOTE>: When they clamber, the long hind toe is sometimes placed sidewise, and some∣times forwards, and is moveable in its joint with the foot, so as accommodate itself to every position: This power is common to all the Woodpeckers.</P>
<P>After the Black Woodpecker has perfo∣rated into the cavity of the tree, it gives
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
a loud shrill and lengthened scream, which is audible at a great distance. It also makes at times a cracking, or rather a scraping, by rubbing its bill rapidly against the sides of its hole.</P>
<P>The female differs from the male in its colour, being of a lighter black, and hav∣ing no red but on the back of the head, and sometimes none at all. It is observed that the red descends lower on the nape of the neck in some individuals, and these are old males.</P>
<P>The Black Woodpecker disappears dur∣ing winter. Agricola supposed that it re∣mained concealed in hollow trees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apud Gesnerum,</HI> p. 677.</NOTE>: but Frisch affirms, that it retires before the rigour of the season, when its provisions fail; for, continues he, the worms then sink deep into the wood, and the ant-hills are covered with ice and snow.</P>
<P>We know not of any bird of the ancient continent, whether in Asia or Africa, that is analogous to the European Woodpecker; and it would seem to have migrated hither from the New World, where many species occur that closely resemble it.

<P>THIS Woodpecker is found in Carolina, and is the largest of the genus, be∣ing equal or even superior in bulk, to the crow. Its bill is white like ivory, and three inches long, channeled through its whole length, and so sharp and strong, says Catesby, that, in an hour or two, the bird often makes a bushel of chips: Hence the Spaniards term it <HI>carpenteros,</HI> or carpenter.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="62"/>
Its head is decorated behind by a great scarlet tuft, parted into two tufts, one of which falls on the neck, and the other is raised, and covered by long black threads, which rise from the crown and invest the whole head, for the scarlet feathers lie be∣hind: a white stripe, descending on the side of the neck, and making an angle on the shoulder, runs into the white that co∣vers the lower part of the back and the middle quills of the wing; all the rest of the plumage is a jet deep black.</P>
<P>It hollows its nest in the largest trees, and breeds during the rainy season.

<P>THIS Woodpecker, which is common in Louisiana, occurs equally in Caro∣lina and in Virginia: It resembles much the preceding, but its bill is not white, and it
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
is rather smaller; though it somewhat ex∣ceeds the Black Woodpecker of Europe. The crown of the head, as far as the eyes, is decorated by a large scarlet crest, col∣lected into a single tuft, and thrown back∣wards in the shape of flame; above there is a black bar, in which the eye is placed; a red mustachoe is traced from the root of the bill on the black sides of the head; the throat is white; a fillet of the same colour passes between the eye and the mustachoe, and extends on the neck as far as the shoulder; all the rest of the body is black, with some slight marks of white on the wing, and a larger spot of that colour on the middle of the back; under the body, the black is lighter, and mixed with gray waves; in the female, the forepart of the head is brown, and there are no red fea∣thers, but on the hind part of the head.</P>
<P>Catesby says that these birds, not con∣tent with rotten trees which supply their usual food, attack also the plants of maize; and do much injury, for the wet insinuates into the holes which they make in the husk, and spoils the seeds.

With this bird, we must also join a Woodpecker which Commerson brought from the country contiguous to the Straits of Magellan: Its bulk is the same, and its other characters pretty similar; only it has no red, except on the cheeks and the fore∣part of the head, and the back of its head bears a tuft of black feathers. Thus, the same species occurs, in the corresponding latitudes at the two extremities of the great continent of America.

<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
we perceive small feathers of the same red which clothe the top of the neck.</P>
<P>Barrere is right in referring this Wood∣pecker to the <HI>hipecoo</HI> of Marcgrave, as much as Brisson is wrong in referring it to the great Carolina Woodpecker of Catesby: the latter is larger than a crow, and the hipecoo exceeds not a pigeon. And the rest of Maregrave's description agrees with the ouantoo as much as with the great Carolina Woodpecker, which has not the underside of its body variegated with black and white, as the ooantoo and the hipecoo; and its bill is three lines, not six. But these characters belong as little to the Black Woodpecker of Louisiana; and Brisson was mistaken too in placing with it the ooan∣too, which as we have just seen, is nothing but the hipecoo, and would have been bet∣ter ranged with his eleventh species.</P>

<P>Very few of these birds are seen in Vir∣ginia during winter; there are more of them in that season in Carolina, though fewer than in summer; it would seem that they retire to the South to escape the cold.

Catesby adds that this Woodpecker con∣sumes much fruit and grain; but it pro∣bably never recurs to these, unless in case of want of other sustenance, else it would differ from all the rest of the genus.</P>

<P>THIS is the third species of the Euro∣pean Woodpeckers. Its plumage is agreeably variegated with white and black, embellished with red on the head and belly. The crown of the head is black, with a red bar on the occiput, and the hood terminates in a black point on the neck; thence rise two branches of black, one of which stretches on each side to the root of the bill and marks a mustachoe, and the other descend∣ing to the lower part of the neck, decorates it with a collar; this black streak unites near the shoulder with the black piece that
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
occupies the middle of the back; two great white spaces cover the shoulders; in each wing the great quills are brown, the others black, and all mixed with white; the whole of the black is deep, and the whole of the white is pure and unmixed; the red on the head is bright, and that of the belly is a fine scarlet. Thus the plumage of this bird is charmingly diversified, and surpasses that of all the other Woodpeckers in beauty.</P>
<P>This description answers only to the male exactly; the female figured in the <HI>Plan∣ches Enluminées</HI> has no red on the back of the head. Some spotted Woodpeckers are clothed with a less beautiful plumage, and some even are entirely white. There is also a variety whose colours appear more obscure, and though all the upper side of the head and the belly are red, the tint is pale and dull.</P>
<P>Of this variety, Brisson makes his second <HI>Variegated Woodpecker,</HI> though he had be∣fore produced it under the name of the <HI>Great Variegated Woodpecker;</HI> yet these two birds are both nearly of the same size, and have ever been referred to the same species. Belon, who lived in an age when the rules of nomenclature and the errors of sysytem had not multiplied the divisions in the ar∣rangement
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>
of natural objects, classes all these varieties with his <HI>epeiche</HI> or Varie∣gated Woodpecker. But Aldrovandus justly blames both him and Turner for applying to that bird the name <HI>Picus Martius,</HI> which belongs only to the Green Woodpecker.</P>
<P>The Variegated Woodpecker strikes a∣gainst the trees with brisker and harder blows than the Green Woodpecker; it creeps with great ease upwards, or down∣wards, and horizontally under the branches; the stiff quills of its tail serve to support it, when it hangs in an inverted posture, and knocks keenly with its bill. It is a shy bird; for when it perceives a person, it hides itself behind a branch and remains still. Like the other Woodpeckers, it breeds in a hollow tree. In our provinces, it ap∣proaches the habitations during winter, and seeks to settle on the bark of fruit trees, where the crysalids and eggs of insects are deposited in greater quantity than on the trees of the forest.</P>
<P>In summer during droughts, the Varie∣gated Woodpeckers are often killed at the wood meres, whither these birds repair to drink: it approaches the spot in silence, fluttering from tree to tree; and each time it halts it seems anxiously to examine if any
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
danger threatens: it has an air of inquie∣tude; it listens, and turns its head on all sides, and even looks through the foliage to the ground below; and the least noise is sufficient to drive it back. When it reaches the tree next the mere, it descends from branch to branch, until it gets to the lowest on the margin of the water; it then dips its bill, and at each sip, it hearkens, and casts a look round it. After its thirst is quenched, it retires quickly, without ma∣king a pause as on its arrival. When it is shot on a tree, it seldom drops; but as long as a spark of life remains, it clings firmly with its nails, so that one is often obliged to fire a second time.</P>
<P>This bird has a very large <HI>sternum;</HI> its intestinal canal is sixteen inches long, but there is no <HI>coecum;</HI> its stomach is membra∣nous; the point of its bill is bony, and five lines in length. An adult male which had been taken from a nest of five young, weighed two ounces and an half; these weighed three gros each, and their toes were disposed as in the father; their bill wanted the two lateral ridges, which, in the adult, took their origin beyond the nostrils, went below them, and extended two thirds of the length of the bill; the nails, though
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
yet white, were already much hooked. The nest was in an old hollow aspin, thirty feet above the ground. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Picus Major.</HI> "It is varie∣gated with black and white, its vent and the back of its head, red."

This little spotted Woodpecker is scarcely so large as a sparrow, and weighs only an ounce. In winter it resorts near houses and vineyards. It does not creep very high on large trees, and seems to prefer the circum∣ference of the trunk. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE> It nestles in some hole of a tree, and often disputes the pos∣session with the Colemouse, which is com∣monly worsted in the struggle and compel∣led to surrender its lodging. It is found in England, where it has received the name of <HI>hickwall.</HI> It also inhabits Sweden: and this species, like that of the greater spotted Woodpecker, would appear to be diffused even to North America; for in Louisiana a small spotted Woodpecker is seen which resembles it almost entirely, except that the upper side of the head, as in the Variegated Woodpecker of Canada, is covered with a black cap, edged with white.</P>
<P>Salerne says that this bird is unknown in France, yet it occurs in most of our provin∣ces. The mistake originated from his con∣founding the lesser spotted Woodpecker with the Wall Creeper, with which he owns that he was unacquainted. He was equally deceived in asserting that Frisch makes no mention of this Woodpecker, from which he
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
infers that it exists not in Germany: for that naturalist says only that it is rare, but gives two excellent figures of it.</P>
<P>M. Sonnerat saw, in the island of Anti∣gua, a small Variegated Woodpecker, which we shall refer to this, since the characters which he gives are insufficient to discrimi∣nate two species. It is of the same bulk; black, striped and streaked with white, co∣vers all the upper surface of the body; the under surface is spotted with blackish, on a pale yellow, or rather yellowish white ground; a white line marks the sides of the neck. M.

<P>THIS Woodpecker is of a middle size between the Green Woodpecker and the Spotted Woodpecker of Europe: Cates∣by makes it too small, when he compares

it to the Spotted Woodpecker; and Edwards represents it too large, in asserting it to be equal in bulk to the Green Woodpecker. The same author reckons only eight quills in the tail, but probably the two others were want∣ing in the subject which he describes; for all the Woodpeckers have ten quills in the tail. It has a red hood which falls on the arch of the neck; the throat and stomach are rusty gray, which runs by degrees into a dull red on the belly; the back is black, striped transversely with gray waves in fes∣toons, which are lighter on the wings, broader and entirely white on the rump.</P>
<P>The figure which Sir Hans Sloane has given of it is very defective, and it is the only one that this naturalist and Brown found in the island of Jamaica, though there are great many others on the continent of America.

<P>THOUGH this Woodpecker has a yel∣low tinge on the belly, we shall not exclude it from those which are variegated with white and black, since these colours appear on the upper surface, which really characterizes the plumage.

<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
space between the temple and the cheek, and the last of these stripes bounds the throat, which is of the same red with the head; the black and white intermingle and intersect each other agreeably on the back, the wings, and the tail; the fore part of the body is a light yellow, sprinkled with some black speckles. The female wants the red. This Woodpecker inhabits, according to Brisson, Virginia, Carolina, and Cayenne.</P>

<HEAD>The VARIEGATED UNDATED WOODPECKER, <HI>Ninth Species. Picus Tridactylus var.</HI> Linn. Gmel. &amp;c. <HI>The Southern three-toed Woodpecker,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THE plumage resembles that of the Spot∣ted Woodpecker; the back is black, with white disposed in waves or rather scales on the great quills of the wing, and these two colours form, when it is closed, a check∣ed bar: the under surface of the body is white, variegated on the sides with black scales; two white streaks stretch backwards, one from the eye, the other from the bill, and the top of the head is red.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="91"/>
The figure of this bird agrees perfectly with Brisson's description of the <HI>Variegated Cayenne Woodpecker,</HI> except that the former has four toes as usual, and the latter only three. We cannot therefore doubt the existence of three-toed Woodpeckers: Lin∣naeus describes one found in Dalecarlia; Schmidt, one in Siberia; and we are informed by Lottinger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from M. Lottinger, to M. de Mont∣beillard, dated Strasburg, 22d September, 1774.</NOTE> that it occurs also in Switzerland. The three-toed Wood∣pecker appears therefore to inhabit the north of both continents. Ought the want of the toe to be regarded as a specific character, or considered as only an accidental de∣fect? It would require a great many obser∣vations to answer that question; but it may be denied that the same bird inhabits also the equatorial regions, though after Bris∣son it is termed <HI>the Spotted Cayenne Wood∣pecker</HI> in <HI>the Planches Enluminees.</HI></P>
<P>After this long enumeration of the birds of both continents that are akin to the Woodpeckers, we must observe that we have been obliged to reject some species no∣ticed by our nomenclators. These are the third, eighth, and twentieth, which Bris∣son ranges with the Woodpeckers, Seba with the herons, and Moehring with the
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
crows. Klein calls these birds <HI>harpooneers;</HI> because, according to Seba, they dart from the air upon fish and transfix them. But this habitude belongs not to the Wood∣peckers; and the disposition of the toes, which in Seba's figure are disposed <HI>three</HI> and <HI>one,</HI> besides demonstrate that they are quite a distinct kind.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>The WOODPECKER-CREEPERS. <HI>Les Pic-Grimpereaux.</HI> Buff.</HEAD>
<P>THE genus of these birds, of which we know only two species, appears manifestly discriminated, and constitutes the intermediate link between the Wood∣peckers and the Creepers. The first and largest species resembles most the creepers, by its curved bill; and the second, on the contrary, is more analogous to the Wood∣peckers since it has a straight bill. Both of them have three toes before and one be∣hind, like the Creepers; and at the same time the quills of their tail are stiff and pointed, like the Woodpeckers.</P>
<P>The first was ten inches long; its head and throat spotted with rufous and white; the upper side of the body, rufous, and the
<PB N="78" REF="93"/>
underside, yellow, striped transversely with blackish; the bill and feet black.</P>
<P>The second was only seven inches long; its head, neck, and breast, spotted with rufous and white; the underside of the body is rufous, and the belly rusty brown; the bill gray, and the feet blackish.</P>
<P>Both these birds have very nearly the same natural habits; they creep against trees like Woodpeckers, supporting themselves by the tail; they bore the bark and the wood with much noise, and they feed upon the insects thus detected: they inhabit the forests and seek the vicinity of springs, and rivulets. The two species live together, and often on the same tree, on which ma∣ny other small birds are perched; yet they are only fond of each others society, and never intermix the breed. They are very agile, and flutter from tree to tree, but ne∣ver perch or fly to a distance. They are commonly found in the interior parts of Guiana, where the natives of the country confound them with the Woodpeckers; which is the reason that they have received no appropriated name. It is probable that they also inhabit the other warm climates of America, though no traveller has men∣tioned them.</P>

<P>THIS bird may be distinguished at first sight by a habit peculiar to itself; it twists and turns back its neck, its head re∣verted on its back, and its eyes half-shut, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ii. xii. Schwenckfeld.</NOTE> and the motion is slow, tortuous, and ex∣actly similar to the waving wreaths of a reptile. It seems to be occasioned by a convulsion of surprize and fright; and it is also an effort which the bird makes to dis∣engage itself when held, yet this motion is natural to it, and depends in a great mea∣sure on its structure; for the callow brood
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>
have the same vermicular wreathing, and many a timorous nest-finder has fancied them to be young serpents <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Wryneck has also another singular habit. One which had been shut twenty∣four hours in a cage, turned towards a person who approached it, and, eyeing him steadily, it rose upon its spurs, stretch∣ed slowly forwards, raising the feathers on the top or its head and spreading its tail; then it suddenly drew back, striking the bottom of the cage with its bill, and re∣tracting its crest. It repeated this gesture, which was also observed by Schwencfeld, to the number of an hundred times, and as long as the spectator remained beside it.</P>
<P>These strange attitudes and natural con∣tortions seem antiently to have prompted superstition to adopt this bird in enchant∣ments, and to prescribe its flesh as the most powerful incentive to love; insomuch, that the name <HI>lynx</HI> denoted all sort of enchant∣ments, violent passions, and whatever we call the charm of beauty; that blind power which irresistibly commands our affections. Such is the sense in which Heliodorus, Lycophron, Pindar, Aeschylus, and Sopho∣cles
<PB N="81" REF="97"/>
employ it. The enchantress in Theo∣critus makes this charm, to recall her lover. It was Venus herself that, from Mount Olympus, brought the Jynx to Ja∣son, and taught him its virtue, to win the heart of Medea, (Pindar). The bird was once a nymph, the daughter of Echo: by her enchantments, Jupiter became enamour∣ed of Aurora; and Juno, in wrath, per∣formed the metamorphosis. <HI>See</HI> Suidas, and the Scholiast of Lycophron, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Heliodorus, Pindar, and Eras∣mus.</P>
<P>The species of the Wryneck is no where numerous: each individual leads a sequest∣ered life, and even migrates solitarily. They arrive singly in the month of May <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesnér says that he has seen them in the month of April.</NOTE>. They never enter into any society but that of the female, and it is only transitory, for the domestic union is dissolved, and they retire in September. The Wryneck prefers, for the sake of solitude, a straggling tree in the midst of some broad hedge-row. Towards the end of summer, it is found alone among the fields of corn, particularly oats, and in the small paths that run through patches of buck-wheat. It feeds on the ground,

<P>The Wryneck is as large as the Lark, being seven inches long, and ten inches across the wings; all its plumage is a mixture of gray, of black, and of tawny, disposed in waves and bars, contrasted so as to produce the richest enamel with these dusky shades <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Pindar calls the Jynx, variegated. <HI>Gesner.</HI></NOTE>; the underside of the body is of a white gray ground, tinged with rus∣ty on the neck, and painted with small black zones, which separate on the breast, and stretch into a lance-shape, and are scat∣tered and diluted on the stomach; the tail consists of ten flexible quills, which the bird spreads when it flies, and which are variegated below with black points on a dusky-gray ground, and intersected by two or three broad waved bars like those on the wings of night flies; the same mixture of beautiful undulations of black, of brown, and of gray, among which are perceived zones, lozenges, and zigzag lines, paints all the upper surface on a deeper and more rusty

ground. Some describers have compared the plumage of the Wryneck to that of the Woodcock; but it is more agreeably vari∣ed, its tints are clearer and distincter, of a softer feel, and have a finer effect; the cast of the colour is rufous in the male, and more cinereous in the female, which discriminates them; the feet are rusty gray; the nails sharp, the two exterior much longer than the two interior.</P>
<P>This bird holds itself very erect on the branch where it sits, and its body is even bent backwards. It clings in the same way to the trunk of a tree when it sleeps; but it never clambers like the Woodpecker, nor seeks its food under the bark; its bill, which is nine lines in length and fashioned as those of the Woodpeckers, does not assist it in finding its nourishment, and is nothing but the sheath of a large tongue three or four fingers in length, which it darts into the ant-hills, and which it again draws back covered with ants that stick to its viscous humidity. The point of the tongue is sharp and horny; and, to give it exten∣sion, two great muscles rise from its root, and, after inclosing the larynx, and stretch∣ing to the crown of the head as in the Woodpeckers, are inserted in the front.

<P>NATURALISTS have applied the epithet <HI>bearded</HI> to several birds that have the base of their bill beset with detached feathers, long and stiff like bristles, all of them di∣rected forward. But we must observe, that under this designation, some birds of differ∣ent species and from very distant climates have been confounded. The <HI>tamatia</HI> of Marcgrave, which comes from Brazil, has been ranged with the Barbet of Africa and that of the Philippines; and all those which have a beard on their bill, and two toes be∣fore and two behind, have been grouped together by our nomenclators. Yet the natives of the old continent are discrimina∣ted from those of the new, their bill being much thicker, shorter, and more convex below.

<P>WE have already remarked that Brisson was mistaken in ranging this bird with the little thrushs of Catesby; for it is entirely different in the disposition of its toes, and the shape of its bill, as well as in its beard, and the largeness of its head, a property common to the whole genus. Marcgrave is inaccurate too, in asserting that it wants the tail; this is indeed short, but his specimen was probably incomplete. All the other characters correspond; and as the bird occurs not only in Brazil, but also in Cayenne, whence it has been sent to us, we can easily compare the description.</P>
<P>Its total length is six inches and a half of which the tail occupies two inches; the bill is fifteen lines, its upper extremity hooked, and as it were, divided into two points; the beard which covers it, extends more than half its length; the upper side of the

<P>The habitudes of this Tamatia are the same with those of all the birds of the same genus found in the New Continent: they reside in the most sequestered parts of the forests, and constantly remote from dwell∣ings and even cleared grounds: they never appear in flocks, or in pairs: they fly labo∣riously, and to short distances, and never alight but on low branches, preferring such as are thickest clothed with sprays and leaves: they have little vivacity, and when once seated, they remain a long time: they have even a dull, melancholy aspect, and they might be said to affect giving them∣selves an air of gravity, by sinking their large head between their shoulders; and it then seems to cover all the forepart of the body. Their disposition corresponds exactly to their massy figure and their seri∣ous deportment. They are so unwieldly that they have much difficulty to move;
<PB N="90" REF="107"/>
and a person may advance as near as he pleases and fire several times, without driv∣ing them to flight. Their flesh is not bad, though they live on caterpillars and other large insects.

<HEAD>The TOUCANS.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT may be termed the physiog∣nomy of animated beings results from the aspect of their head in different posi∣tions. Their form, their figure, their shape, &amp;c. refer to the appearance of their body and of its members. In birds, it is easy to perceive, that such as have a small head and a short slender bill, exhibit a deli∣cate, pleasing, and sprightly physiognomy. Those, on the contrary, with an over-pro∣portioned head, such as the Barbets, or with a bill as large as the head, such as the Toucans, have an air of stupidity, which seldom belies their natural talents. A person who saw a Toucan for the first time might take the head and bill, in the front view, as one of those long-nosed masks that frighten children; but when he seriously examined this enormous production, he would be surprized that nature had given so huge a bill to a bird of such moderate size, and his astonishment would increase on reflect∣ing, that it was useless and even burthen∣some to its owner, which it obliged to swallow its food whole without dividing or
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
crushing. And so far is this bill from serv∣ing the bird as an instrument of defence, or even as a counterpoise, that it acts like a weight on a lever which tends constantly to destroy the balance, and occasion a sort of hobbling motion.</P>
<P>The true character of nature's errors is disproportion joined to in utility. All those parts of animals which are overgrown or misplaced, and which are useless or incon∣venient, ought not to be ranged in the great plan of the universe; they should be imputed to her caprice or oversight, which however tend equally to their object, since these extraordinary productions evince, that whatever can be, actually exists; and that though a regular symmetry commonly ob∣tains, the disorders, the excesses, and the defects which are permitted, demonstrate the extent of that power which is con∣fined not to those ideas of proportion and system that we are apt to regard as the standards.</P>
<P>And as nature has bestowed on most ani∣mals all the qualities that conspire to beau∣ty and perfection of form, she has also admitted more than one defect in her care∣less productions. The enormous and use∣less bill of the Toucan includes a tongue, still more useless, and whose structure is
<PB N="105" REF="123"/>
very uncommon; it is not fleshy or cartila∣ginous as in other birds, but a real feather misplaced.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Toucan</HI> means <HI>feather</HI> in the language of Brazil, and <HI>Toucan tabouracé,</HI> which signifies <HI>feathers for dancing,</HI> is ap∣plied by the natives to that bird which furnishes them with the decorations worn on festival days. Indeed these birds, so shapeless and monstrous in their bill and tongue, have a brilliant plumage; their throat is orange of the most vivid hue; and though such beautiful feathers are found only in some species of Toucans, yet have they given name to the whole genus. These feathers are even in Europe in request for making muffs. The huge bill of the Toucan has acquired it other honours, and translated it among their southern constel∣lations, where nothing is admitted but what is striking or wonderful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal des Observations Physiques du P. Feuillée, p. 428.</NOTE>. Besides the ex∣cessive length of this bill, it is through its whole length wider than the head of the bird; Lery has termed it, <HI>the bill of bills</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Brasil. p. 174.</NOTE>, other voyagers have named the Toucan the <HI>bird all-bill</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dampier's Voyage round the World.</NOTE>, and the Creoles of Cayenne
<PB N="106" REF="124"/>
apply to it the epithet of <HI>Grosbeak.</HI> The mag∣nitude of the bill would exceedingly fatigue the head and neck, were it not very thin, insomuch that it may easily be crushed be∣tween the fingers. Authors <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Hernandez.</NOTE> were there∣fore mistaken in asserting, that the Tou∣cans bored trees, like the Woodpeckers; or they were at least mislead by the Spaniards, who have confounded these birds under the same name <HI>carpenteros</HI> (carpenter), or <HI>tacatacas</HI> in the language of Peru. But it is certain that the Toucans are very differ∣ent from the Woodpeckers, and could not imitate them in that habit; and indeed Scaliger has before us remarked that as their bill was hooked downwards, it seemed im∣possible for them to make a perforation.</P>
<P>The form of this huge unwieldy bill is very different in each mandible: the upper one is bent into the shape of a fickle, rounded above, and hooked at the extre∣mity; the under one is shorter, narrower and less curved below. Both of them have indentings on the edges, but which are much more perceptible on the upper than on the under; and what appears still more singular, these indentings do not fit into each other, nor even correspond in their relative position, those on the right side not
<PB N="107" REF="125"/>
being opposite to those on the left, for they begin more or less behind, and end also more or less forward.</P>
<P>The tongue of the Toucans is, if possi∣ble, more wonderful than the bill: they are the only birds which may be said to have a feather instead of a tongue, and a feather it certainly is, though the shaft is a cartilaginous substance two lines broad; for on both sides there are very close barbs, entirely like those of ordinary feathers, and which are longer the nearer they are inserted to the extremity. With an organ so singular and so different from the ordinary substance and organization of the tongue, we might suppose that these birds were mute; yet they have a voice as well as the rest, and often utter a sort of whistling, which is reiterated so quickly, and with such continuance that they have been denominated the <HI>preaching birds.</HI> The savages ascribe great virtues to this feathery tongue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de la Condamine speaks of a Toucan which he saw on the banks of the Maragnon, whose monstrous bill is red and yellow; its tongue, he says, which resembles a delicate feather, is esteemed to have great virtues. <HI>Voyage a la riviere des Amazones, Paris,</HI> 1745. <HI>See</HI> also Gemelli Carreri, <HI>Paris,</HI> 1719. tom. VI. p. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and use it as a cure in many disorders. Some authors <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Barrere.</NOTE> have supposed that the Toucans had no nostrils;
<PB N="108" REF="126"/>
but we may see them by stroking aside the feathers at the base of the bill, which in most species conceal them; in others, they are bare, and consequently very apparent.</P>
<P>The Toucans have nothing in common with the Woodpeckers, but the disposition of their toes, two placed before and two behind. Even in this character, a distinc∣tion may be perceived; the toes are much longer and differently proportioned than in Woodpeckers; the outer fore-toe is almost as long as the whole foot, which is indeed very short, and the other toes are also very long, the two inner ones are the least so. The feet of the Toucans are only half the length of the legs, so that they cannot walk, but hop, and that awkwardly: the feet are not feathered, but covered with long soft scales. The nails are proportioned to the length of the toes, arched, and somewhat flattened, ob∣tuse at the end, and furrowed below length∣wise by a channel; they are of no service to the bird in attack or defence, or even for climbing, but only to support it firmly on the boughs on which it perches.</P>
<P>The Toucans are scattered through all the warm parts of South America, and never occur in the ancient continent. They flit rather than migrate, following the ma∣turity of the fruits on which they feed,
<PB N="109" REF="127"/>
particularly those of the palms; and as these trees delight in wet places near the margin of water, the Toucans affect such situations, and sometimes they even lodge on the mangroves, which grow in deluged mud. And hence it has been supposed that they eat fishes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez and Nieremberg.</NOTE>, but these must at least be very small, since they are obliged to swallow their food entire.</P>
<P>These birds generally go in small bodies from six to ten; their flight is heavy and laborious, owing to the shortness of their wings and the weight of their enormous bill; yet they rise above the tallest trees, on the summits of which they are almost always perched, and in continual flutter, but the vivacity of their motions dispels not their dull air, for the huge bill gives them a serious melancholy countenance, and their large dull eyes augment the effect: in short, though lively and active, they appear the more heavy and awkward.</P>
<P>As they breed in the holes abandoned by the Woodpeckers, it has been supposed they excavate these themselves. They lay only two eggs, yet all the species contain abundance of individuals. They may be easily tamed, if taken young; it is even
<PB N="110" REF="128"/>
said that they will propagate in the domes∣tic state. They are not difficult to rear, for they swallow whatever is thrown to them, bread, flesh, or fish; they also with the point of their bill, lay hold of the bits that are held near them; they toss these up, and receive them in their wide throat. But when they are obliged to provide for themselves, and to gather their food from the ground, they seem to grope, and seize the crumb sidewise, that it may leap up, and be caught in its fall. They are so de∣licate to impressions of cold, as to be affect∣ed by the coolness of evening in the hottest climates, even of the new continent; they have been observed in the house to make a bed of herbs, of straw, and of whatever they could gather. Their skin is in gene∣ral blue under the feathers, and their flesh, though black and hard, is yet palatable.</P>
<P>The genus of these birds subdivides itself into the Toucans and Aracaris: these differ from each other; 1. in size, the Toucans being much larger than the Aracaris, 2. by the dimensions and the substance of their bill, which in the Aracaris is much longer, harder, and solider; 3. by their tail, which is longer in the Aracaris, and very sensibly tapered, whereas it is rounded in

<P>Two birds of this kind have been figu∣red in the <HI>Planches Enluminees;</HI> the first under the denomination of the <HI>Yellow throated Toucan, of Cayenne</HI> <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ramphastos Dicolorus.</HI> "It is blackish; its breast, its belly, its vent, and its rump red; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts throat yellow."</NOTE>, and the second under that of the <HI>yellow-throated tou∣can of Brazil.</HI> <NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ramphastos-Tucanus.</HI> "It is blackish; a bar on its belly, its vent and ramp yellow."</NOTE> But they inhabit equal∣ly both countries, and appear to us to form the same species. The difference in the colour of their bill, in the extent of the yellow plate on the throat, as well as in the vivacity of their colours, may be owing to the age of the bird: It is certain, that the superior coverts of the tail are yellow in some individuals, and red in others. In
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
both, the head and upper side of the body, the wings, and tail, are black; the throat orange, more or less bright; under the throat, a red bar of various width stretches on the breast; the belly is blackish, and the inferior coverts of the tail are red; the bill is black with a blue stripe running from its top all its length: the base of the bill is surrounded by a pretty broad yellow or white bar; the nostrils are concealed in the feathers at the root, and their apertures are round; the legs are twenty lines in length, and bluish; the bill, four inches and a half long, and seventeen lines high above the base; the whole bird, from the end of the bill to the extremity of the tail, is nineteen inches; and if from this we deduct six inches and two or three lines for the tail, and four inches and a half for the bill, there remains hardly nine inches for the length of the head and body.</P>
<P>It is from this species of Toucan, that those brilliant feathers used as ornaments are obtained; all the yellow part is cut off from the skin, and sold at a high price. The males only furnish these fine yellow fea∣thers, for the throat of the females is white; and this distinction has misled the nomen∣clators, who have regarded the male and

<P>In general, the females are very nearly as large as the males; their colours are not so vivid, and the red-bar below the throat is very narrow; in other respects, they are exactly similar. This second species is the most common, and perhaps the most nu∣merous of the Toucans. They abound in Cayenne, particularly in the swampy forests, and on the mangrove trees. Though like the rest of the genus, they have only a fea∣thery tongue, they articulate a sound like <HI>pinien-coin,</HI> which the creoles of Cayenne have employed as its designation, but which

<P>THIS Toucan has a yellow neck, like the preceding; but its breast is a fine red, which in the other is black. Thevet, who first mentioned this bird, says that its bill is as long as its body. Aldrovandus admits the bill to be two palms in length, and one palm in breadth; and Brisson reck∣ons the palm three inches. As we have never seen the bird, we can only speak from the accounts given by the two former writers. We may observe however, that Aldrovandus was mistaken in assigning it three toes before, and one behind; Thevet
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
expressly mentions, that it has two before and two behind, which is conformable to nature.</P>
<P>The head, neck, back, and wings, are black, with whitish reflections; the breast is of a fine gold colour, with red above it, that is, under the throat; the belly, too, and the legs, are of a very bright red, and likewise the extremity of the tail, the rest of which is black; the iris is black, sur∣rounded by a white circle, which itself is inclosed within another yellow circle; the lower mandible is only half as large near the extremity than the corresponding part of the upper mandible; both are indented on the edges.</P>
<P>Thevet assures us, that this bird lives on pepper, of which it swallows such quan∣tities as to be obliged to vomit it. This story has been copied by all the naturalists; and yet there is no pepper in America.

<P>THIS bird is found in Brasil, and is very common in Guiana, where it is called <HI>Gri gri,</HI> because that word expresses its shrill short cry.

Yet the difference is so slight that it may be imputed to age or climate: it consists in a cross bar of fine red on the breast. There is likewise some difference in the colours of the bill; but that character is quite dubious, since these vary in the same individual according to the age, with∣out following any regular order: so that Linnaeus was wrong in drawing the spe∣cific characters of birds from the colours of the bill.</P>
<P>The head, the throat, and the neck are black; the back, the wings and the tail are dull green; the rump, red; the breast and belly, yellow; the inferior coverts of the tail, and the feathers of the legs, olive yellow, variegated with red and fulvous; the eyes large, and the iris yellow; the bill is four inches and a quarter long, sixteen lines high, and of a more solid and harder texture than the bill of the Toucans; the tongue is of the same feathery nature; the feet, blackish-green, very short, and the toes very long: the whole length of the bird, including the bill and the tail, is sixteen inches and eight lines.</P>

<P>THE word <HI>koulik,</HI> pronounced fast, re∣sembles the cry of this bird, which is the reason why the Creoles of Cayenne have imposed that name. It is rather smaller than the preceding, and its bill shorter in proportion; the head, the throat, the neck, and the breast, are black; on the upper side of the neck, there is a yel∣low narrow half-collar; there is a spot-of the same colour on each side of the head, behind the eyes; the back, the rump, and

<P>The female is distinguished from the male by the colour of the top of the neck, where the plumage is brown, but black in the male; the underside of the body, from the throat to the lower part of the belly, is gray in the female, and the half-collar is of a very pale yellow, whereas it is of a fine yellow in the male, and the underside variegated with different colours. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Ramphastos Piperivorus:</HI> "It is green, its foreside black, its vent and thighs red."</NOTE></P>

<P>IHAVE applied the term <HI>Barbican</HI> to de∣note a bird that occupies a middle rank between the Barbets and Toucans. It is a new species, and though it has not hitherto been noticed by naturalists, it belongs to no very distant climate, for we received it from the coast of Barbary, yet without its name, or any account of its natural habits.</P>
<P>The toes are disposed two before and two behind, as in the Barbets and Toucans; it resembles the latter in the distribution of its colours, in the shape of its body, and in its large bill, but it is shorter, much nar∣rower, and solider than that of the Toucans; it resembles at the same time the Barbets in the long bristles which shoot from the base of the bill and extend considerably beyond the nostrils; the shape of the bill is peculiar, the upper mandible being pointed, hooked at its extremity, with two blunt indentings on each side; the lower mandi∣ble is striped transversely with small fur∣rows;

the whole bill is reddish, and curved downwards.</P>
<P>The plumage of the Barbican is black on all the upper part of the body, the top of the breast and belly; and it is red on the rest of the under surface, nearly as in that of the Toucans.</P>

<P>THIS bird partakes of the properties of the Casiques and Toucans, and there∣fore I have termed it <HI>Cassican.</HI> It is a new species sent by Sonnerat. We are uncertain what climate it inhabits, only we presume that it comes from the southern parts of America; it certainly resembles the Ameri∣can Cassiques in the shape of its body and the bald spot on the foreside of the head, at the same time that it is analogous to the Toucan in the bulk, and shape of its bill, which is round and broad at the base, and hooked at the extremity. So that if its bill were larger, and the toes disposed two and two, it might be regarded as a proximate species of the Toucans.</P>
<P>It will be superfluous to describe the co∣lours of this bird; its body is slender and long, being about thirteen inches; the bill is two inches and a half; the tail five inches, and the legs fourteen lines. We are unacquainted with its natural habits; but if we were to judge from the shape of
<PB REF="148"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="129" REF="149"/>
its bill and feet, we should suppose that it lives on prey. Yet the Toucans and Parrots which have their bill and nails hooked, subsist entirely on fruits; and the nails and bill are much less hooked in the Cassican: so that we shall regard it as a frugivorous bird till we are better informed. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Coracias Varia:</HI> "It is black; its underside, the lower part of its back, its rump, and the superior coverts of its tail, white; its tail equal and black, tipt with white."

<HEAD>The CALAOS, Or RHINOCEROS BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have seen that the Toucans, so re∣markable for their enormous bill, belong all of them to the continent of South America. We are now to view other birds, natives of Africa and of India, which wear a bill as prodigiously large, and of a shape still more excessively monstrous. For nature is more vigorous in the ancient than in the new world, and even her errors are more luxuriant.</P>
<P>When we consider the uncommon expan∣sion and cumbrous overgrowth which swells and deforms the bill of these birds, we are struck with the incongruity and discordance of their structure. But nature exhibits other examples of inconsistency; the <HI>cross∣bills</HI> are almost incapacitated for taking their food, and are unable to defend them∣selves against even the weakest and smallest tribes. In the quadrupeds also, the sloths, the ant-eaters, the short-tailed manis, &amp;c. naked or miserable, by reason of the shape of their body, and of the disproportion of their members, drag out a laborious and
<PB N="131" REF="151"/>
painsul existence, continually oppressed by the exuberance, or cramped by the defici∣ency of organization. The life of such fee∣ble imperfect species is protected by solitude alone, and could never be supported and maintained, but in desert recesses, untrod by man or the powerful animals.</P>
<P>The bill of the Calao, though large, is weak and ill compacted, and so far from be∣ing useful, it proves burthensome: it is like a long lever where the force is applied near the <HI>fulcrum,</HI> and consequently the extremity acts feebly: its substance is so tender, that it shivers by the least attrition, and these accidental cracks have been mista∣ken by naturalists for a regular and natural indenting. These produce a remarkable effect on the bill of the Rhinoceros Calao; for the mandibles meet only at the point and the rest remains wide open, as if they were not formed for each other. The in∣terval is worn and broken in such a man∣ner, that this part would seem intended to be used only at first, and afterwards neg∣lected.</P>
<P>We follow our nomenclators in applying the name <HI>calao</HI> to the whole genus of these birds, though the people of India have be∣stowed it only on one or two species. Many naturalists have given them the appellation
<PB N="132" REF="152"/>
<HI>Rhinoceros</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.—Grew.—Clusius.—Willughby, &amp;c.</NOTE>, on account of the sort of horn which rises on the bill; but almost all of them have seen only the bills of those extraordinary birds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edwards, Belon, &amp;c.</NOTE>. We will range the calaos accord∣ing to the most striking character, the sin∣gular shape of the bill. We shall find that even in her aberrations, nature proceeds by insensible gradations, and that of the ten species which compose the genus, there is only one perhaps that merits the designa∣tion of <HI>Rhinoceros bird.</HI></P>
<P>These ten species are;</P>

<ITEM>1. The Calao-rhinoceros.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The round-helmeted Calao.</ITEM>

<ITEM>10. Lastly, the <HI>Tock,</HI> or red-billed Calao of Senegal, of which we have a stuffed spe∣cimen.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If we invert the order of these ten spe∣cies, we shall be able to trace all the steps by which nature arrives at this monstrous conformation of bill. The Tock has a broad bill fashioned as the rest like a sickle; but it is simple, and without any protuberance. In the Manilla Calao, a swell may be per∣ceived on the top of the bill: this is more distinct in the Molucca Calao: still more considerable in the Abyssinian Calao: the excrescence is prodigious in those of the Philippines and Malabar, and quite mon∣strous in the Rhinoceros-Calao. But though these birds admit of such varieties in the bill, they have one general resemblance in the conformation of the feet, the lateral toes being very long, and almost equal to the middle one.</P>

seems applicable to the adult Tock, and his second to the young Tock.</P>
<P>This bird has three toes before and only one behind: the middle one is closely con∣nected to the outer toe as far as the third joint, and much more loosely to the inner toe, and at the first joint only. The bill is very thick, bent downwards, and slightly indented on the sides.</P>
<P>The subject which we describe was twenty inches long; its tail six inches, ten lines: its bill three inches five lines, and twelve lines and a half thick at the base; its horny substance of the bill is thin and light: the legs are eighteen lines high.</P>
<P>These birds which are pretty common in Senegal, are very simple when young; they suffer a person to approach and catch them; and they may be shot at without being scared, or even without their stirring. But age instructs them by experience; their dis∣position, quite alters; they grow extremely shy, and escape to the summits of the trees; while the young ones remain on the lowest branches and the bushes, and continue per∣fectly still, their head sunk between the shoulders, so that the bill only is seen. The young birds scarce ever fly, whereas the old ones soar in a lofty and rapid course.
<PB N="136" REF="156"/>
The young Tocks are numerous in the months of August and September: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may be caught with the hand, and app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r as tame as if they had been reared in the house. But this conduct proceeds from their stupidity, for they do not pick up the food that is thrown to them, and it must be put in their bill; which affords a pre∣sumption that the parents are obliged to maintain them for a great length of time.</P>
<P>The Tock is very different from the Tou∣can, and yet one of our most intelligent na∣turalists has confounded them. Adanson says, in his voyage to Senegal, that he kil∣led two Toucans in that country; but it is certain that there are no Toucans in Afri∣ca. I should therefore presume that our philosophical traveller meant the Tocks. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Buceros Nasutus:</HI> "Its front is smooth, its tail-quills white at the base and at the tip."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS species was hitherto unknown; it was sent to the King's Cabinet by M. Poivre, to whom we owe much other in∣formation, and many curious preparations. The bird is scarcely larger than the Tock; it is 20 inches long; its bill two inches and a half, less curved than that of the Tock, not indented, but as sharp at the edges, and more pointed; above this bill, there is a prominent light festoon, adhering to the upper mandible, and forming a simple in∣flation; the head and neck are white, stained with yellowish, and marked with brown waves; there is a black spot on each side of the head at the ears; the upperside of the body is blackish brown, with some whitish fringes wrought slightly in the quills of the wing; the underside of the body is dirty white; the quills of the tail are of the same colour with those of the wings, only they are intersected in their middle by a rufous

<P>THIS bird was brought by M. Sonnerat, Correspondent of the Cabinet. I shall transcribe the account which he gives of it in his voyage to New Guinea: he calls it the <HI>chiseled bill Calao;</HI> but that epithet is equally applicable to other Calaos.</P>
<P>"The male and female are of the same size, and nearly as large as the great Euro∣pean Raven, rather longer and narrower shaped; their bill is very long and arched into the form of a sickle, indented along its edges above and below, terminated by a sharp point, and depressed at its sides; it is furrowed up and down, or across two thirds of its length; the convex part of these fur∣rows is brown, and the concave spaces are of the colour of orpiment; the rest of the

In the female, the head and the neck are white, except a broad triangular spot, which ex∣tends from the base of the bill, below and behind the eye, as far as the middle of the neck across the sides; this spot is dark green, fluctuating like the neck and back in the male: the female has also the neck and wings of the same colour as in the male; the top of the breast in both sexes is of a light brown red; the belly, the thighs, and the rump are equally of a deep brown red; they both have ten quills in the tail, of which the upper two thirds are of a rusty yellow, and the lower third is a black trans∣verse bar; the feet are lead colour, and

<P>THE name <HI>Alcatraz</HI> has improperly been applied to this bird; and Clusius is the author of the mistake. He has inac∣curately translated the passage of Oviedo; for the Spanish word <HI>alcatraz,</HI> according to Fernandez, Hernandez, and Nieremberg, denotes the Pelican of Mexico. This mis∣take has occasioned another, which our nomenclators have transferred to the whole genus of the Calaos; they suppose that these
<PB N="141" REF="161"/>
birds haunt the margin of water, and hence they bestow the appellation of <HI>hydrocorax</HI> (Water-raven.) But this opinion is refuted by all the observers who have viewed them in their native abodes: Bontius, Camel, and, what carries still more weight, the Calao itself, by its structure, the shape of its feet and bill, demonstrate that it is neither a Raven nor an aquatic bird.</P>
<P>The Molucca Calao is two feet four inches long; the bill eight inches; but the legs are only two inches two lines: this character of the shortness of the legs be∣longs not only to it, but to all the other Calaos, which walk with the utmost diffi∣culty; the bill is five inches long, and two inches and a half thick at its origin; it is blackish cinereous, and supports an excres∣cence, whose substance is solid and like horn; this excrescence is flat before, and extends rounded to the upperside of the head; it has large black eyes, and its aspect is disagreeable; the sides of the head, the wings, and the throat, are black, and that part of the throat is surrounded with a white bar; the quills of the tail are whitish gray; all the rest of the plumage is variegated with brown, with gray, with blackish, and with fulvous; the feet are brown gray, and the bill blackish.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="162"/>
These birds, says Bontius, do not live on flesh, but on fruits and particularly nut∣megs, to which they prove very destructful; and that food communicates to the flesh, which is tender and delicate, an aroma∣tic odour, that renders it more grateful to the palate. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Buceros Hydrocorax:</HI> "Its bony front is flat and truncated before, its belly fulvous."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS bird was brought from Pondi∣chery; it lived the whole of the sum∣mer 1777, in the court-yard of the Mar∣chioness de Pons, who was so kind as to present it to me, for which I take this op∣portunity of expressing the warmest grati∣tude. It was as large as a Raven, or twice as large as the common crow; it was two feet and a half long, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail, which had dropt off in its passage home, and the feathers were begun to grow again, but
<PB REF="163"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE HORN - BILL.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="143" REF="164"/>
had not nearly attained their full size: so that we may presume that the entire length of the bird was about three feet; its bill was eight inches long and two broad, and bent fifteen lines from the straight position; a second bill, if it may be so called, sat like a horn close on the first, and followed its curvature, and extended from the base to within two inches of the point of the bill, it rose two inches three lines; so that, measuring in the middle, the bill together with its horn formed a height of four inches; near the head, they were both of them fifteen lines thick across; the horn was six inches long, and its extremity ap∣peared to have been shortened and split by accident, so that we may reckon it to be half an inch longer: on the whole, this horn has the shape of a true bill, truncated and closed at the extremity, but the junc∣tion is marked by a very perceptible fur∣row, drawn near the middle and following all the curvature of this false bill, which does not adhere to the skull; but its pos∣terior portion, which rises on the head, is still more extraordinary, it is naked and fleshy, and covered with quick skin, through which this parasite member receives the nutritious juices.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="165"/>
The true bill terminates in a blunt point; it is strong, and consisting of a horny, and almost bony, substance, extended in <HI>laminae,</HI> and we may perceive the layers and undula∣tions: the false bill is much thinner, and may be bent even by the fingers; it is of a light substance disposed internally in little cells, which Edwards compares to those of a honey comb: Wormius says that this false bill consists of a matter like crabs shells.</P>
<P>The false bill is black, from the point to three inches behind, and there is a line of the same black at its origin, and also at the root of the true bill; all the rest is yel∣lowish-white. Wormius remarks precisely the same colours; only he adds that the inside of the bill and of the palate, is black.</P>
<P>A white folded skin meets the root of the true bill above on both sides, and is inserted near the corners of the bill in the black skin that encircles the eyes; the eye∣lid is bordered with long lashes arched be∣hind; the eye is red brown, and grows ani∣mated and sparkles when the bird is in commotion; the head, which appears small in proportion to the enormous bill which it bears, resembles much in its shape that of the Jay: in general, the figure, the ges∣ture, and the whole form of this Calao,
<PB N="145" REF="166"/>
appears to us composed of the features and movements of the Jay, the Raven, and the Magpie. These resemblances have struck most observers, and hence the bird has been called, <HI>the India Raven, the Horned Crow, The Horned Pie of Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>The feathers on the head and neck were black, which it had the power of bristling, and they were often in that state, as in the Jay; those of the back and wings were also black, and all of them had a slight reflec∣tion of violet and green: on some of the coverts of the wings, there was an edging irregularly traced, and the feathers seemed bunched out like those of the Jay; the stomach and belly were of a dirty white; among the great quills of the wings, which are black, the outer ones only are white at the point; the tail, which had begun to grow again, consisted of six white quills black at the root, and four which were springing from their shafts entirely black; the legs are black, thick, and strong, and covered with broad scales; the nails, which were long, but not sharp, seemed calculated for holding and clenching. This bird hopped with both its feet at once, forward and side∣wise, like the Jay and Magpie, but did not walk. When at rest, its head seemed to
<PB N="146" REF="167"/>
recline on its shoulders; when disturbed by surprize and inquietude, it swelled and raised itself, and seemed to assume an air of bold∣ness and importance. Yet its usual gait was mean and stupid; its movements sudden and disagreeable; and its resemblance in features to the Magpie and the Raven, gave it an ignoble aspect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bontius.</NOTE>, suited to its dispo∣sitions. Though there are species of Calaos that appear to be frugivorus, and we have seen this bird eat lettuces, which it first bruised in its bill; it swallowed raw flesh: it caught rats, and devoured even a small bird, which was thrown to it alive. It often repeated the hoarse cry <HI>ook, ook;</HI> it uttered also from time to time another sound, which was feebler, and not so rau∣cous, and exactly like the clucking of a Turkey-hen when she leads her brood.</P>
<P>We have seen it spread and open its wings to the sun, and shudder at a passing cloud, or a slight breeze. It did not live more than three months at Paris, and died before the end of summer. Our climate is therefore too cold for it.</P>

<P>THIS Calao appears to be one of the largest of the genus; yet, if we were to judge from the length and thickness of the bills, we should reckon the Rhinoceros Calao still larger. The bill of the Abys∣sinian Calao seems fashioned after that of the Raven, only it is more bulky; the total length of the bird is three feet two inches; it is entirely black, except the great quills of the wings, which are white, the middle ones and a part of the coverts, which are of a deep tawny brown; the bill has an easy, equal arch through its whole length, and it is flat and compressed at the sides; the two mandibles are hallowed internally with furrows, and terminate in a blunt point. The bill is nine inches long; it bears a semi∣circular
<PB N="149" REF="170"/>
prominence that reaches from its root to near the front, two inches and a half in diameter, and fifteen lines broad at its base over the eyes; this excrescence is of the same substance with the bill, but thinner and yields under the fingers; the height of the bill taken vertically and joined to that of its horn, is three inches eight lines; the feet measure five inches and a half; the great toe, including the nail, is twenty-eight lines; the three fore toes are almost equal; the hind one is also very long, being two inches; all of them are thick, and covered, as well as the legs, with blackish scales, and furnished with strong nails, but which are neither hooked nor sharp: on each side of the upper mandible near its origin, is a reddish spot; the eye∣lids are provided with long lashes: a naked skin of violet brown encircles the eyes, and covers the throat and part of the foreside of the neck.</P>

<P>THIS bird is, according to Brisson, of the size of the Turkey-hen; but its head is proportionally much larger, which is indeed requisite to support a bill nine inches long, and two inches eight lines thick, and which carries, above the upper mandible, a horny excrescence six inches long, and three inches broad; this excres∣cence is a little concave on the upper part, and the two anterior angles are produced before into the shape of a double horn; it extends rounding on the upper part of the head; the nostrils are placed near the origin of the bill, below this excrescence. All the bill, as well as this excrescence, is of a reddish colour.</P>
<P>The head, the throat, the neck, the up∣perside of the body, and the superior coverts of the wings and tail, are black; all the underside of the body is white; the quills of the wings are black, and marked with
<PB N="151" REF="172"/>
a white spot; all the quills of the tail are entirely black, except the two exterior ones, which are white; the legs are greenish.</P>
<P>George Camel has, along with the other birds of the Philippines, described a species of Calao, which seems to be much like the present, but not exactly the same. His ac∣count was communicated to the Royal So∣ciety of London, by Dr. Petiver, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions, <HI>No.</HI> 285. <HI>Art. III.</HI> It there appears, that this bird termed <HI>Calao</HI> or <HI>Cagao</HI> by the people of India, does not haunt streams, but inhabits the uplands, and even the mountains, living on the fruits of the <HI>baliti,</HI> which is a sort of wild fig-tree, and also on almonds, pis∣tachio nuts, &amp;c. which it swallows entire. We shall here insert a translation: "The bill is black; the rump and back dusky ash colour; the head small, and black about the eyes; the eye lashes black and long; the eyes blue; the bill is a span in length, somewhat curved, serrated, diaphanous, and of the colour of cinnabar; the lower man∣dible is about an inch and a half broad at the middle; the upper mandible is a palm in height, more than a span in length, the top flat and about a span in measure, and bearing a helmet of a palm in breadth. The tongue is small for such a bill, being hardly
<PB N="152" REF="173"/>
an inch. Its voice resembles more the grunting of a sow, or the bellowing of an ox, than the cry of a bird. Its legs with the thighs are a span in length: the feet have three toes before, and only one be∣hind, which are scaly, reddish, and armed with solid black talons: the tail consists of eight great white quills, of a cubit in length; the quills of the wings are yellow. The Gentiles revere this bird, and relate stories of its fighting with the Crane which they call <HI>Tipul</HI> or <HI>Tihol;</HI> they say, that after this battle, the Cranes were obliged to remain in the wet grounds, and that the Calaos would not suffer them to approach the mountains <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are sorry to remark that the translation which the Count de Buffon here gives is exceedingly inaccurate. <HI>Ses∣quiuncia</HI> is rendered <HI>half an inch,</HI> &amp;c. We have therefore altered it in some places; but, as the last sentence is that from which our ingenious author draws his conclusion, we have preserved it as it stood in the text. We shall now compare it with the original: <HI>"Calao,</HI> (says Camel,) Gen∣tiles superstitiose colunt et observant, fabulantur cum Grue <HI>Tipul</HI> seu Tihol pactasse, ut haec palustribus, Calao sylvosis, contenta viverent (hinc Tipol si ligno quocunque insederit, in paenam transgressi foederis sese loco movere non valere, e contra Calao si aquosis et humilibus." That is, the idola∣trous Indians have a superstitious veneration for the Calao, and relate that it has entered into a compact with the Crane that it should live contented with its marshes, and the Calao with the woods, thence the Crane, if it perch on a tree, cannot stir from the spot, as a punishment for infring∣ing the treaty; and on the other hand, the Calao incurs the same punishment, if it alights in the low fens.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="174"/>
This sort of description seems to prove clearly that the Calaos are not aquatic birds; and as the colours and some other charac∣ters are different from those of the Philip∣pine Calao, described by Brisson, we con∣ceive that this should be reckoned a variety of the other.</P>

<P>WE have only the bill of this bird, and it is like that given by Edwards. If we judge of the size of the bird from the bulk of the head, which remains attached to the bill, this Calao is one of the largest and strongest of the genus; the bill is six inches long, from the corners to the point; it is almost straight, and not indented: from the middle of the upper mandible there rises and extends as far as the occiput, a wen shaped like a helmet, two inches high, almost round, but a little compressed on
<PB N="154" REF="175"/>
the sides; this protuberance where it joins the bill, has an altitude of four inches and a circumference of eight. The faded and embrowned colours of this bill, which is deposited in the Cabinet, no longer exhibit that vermillion tinge which appears in Edwards' figure.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus gives a distinct figure of the bill of this round helmeted Calao under the name of <HI>Semenda, a bird of India, whose history is still almost entirely fabulous.</HI> This bill, which belonged to the Cabinet of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, had been brought from Damascus. The helmet was of an oval shape; it was white before and red behind; the bill was a palm in length, pointed, and channeled.

<P>SOME Authors have confounded this bird with the <HI>Tragopanda</HI> of Pliny, which is the cassowary, known to the Greeks and Romans, and which was found in Barbary and the Levant, very remote from the native seat of this Calao.</P>
<P>The Rhinoceros bird seen by Bontius in the island of Java, is much larger than the European Raven; it has an offensive smell, and is very ugly. Bontius thus proceeds; "Its plumage is all black, and its bill oddly fashioned; for on its upper part, there rises an excrescence of a horny substance which extends forward, and then bends back towards the top like a horn, and which
<PB N="156" REF="177"/>
is of a prodigious size, for it is eight inches long, and four broad at the base: this horn is variegated with red and yellow, and as if divided into two parts by a black line that extends on each of the sides lengthwise; the nostrils are placed below this excres∣cence near the root of the bill. It is found in Sumatra, in the Philippines, and in other hot parts of India."</P>
<P>Bontius relates some particulars with re∣gard to the oeconomy of these birds; he says that they live on carrion, and com∣monly follow the hunters of wild cows, boars, and stags, who to lessen the trouble of conveying their game, are obliged to divide carcases, and send them to the boats on the river, lest the Calaos should devour them. Yet these birds attack no animals but rats and mice, and for that reason the Indians rear some of them. Bontius tells us that the Calao first flattens the mouse in its bill to soften it; and then tosses it in the air, receives it in its wide throat, and swallows it entire: indeed this is the only mode of eating compatible with the structure of its bill, and the smallness of its tongue, which is concealed almost in the throat <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Philosophical Transactions, <HI>No.</HI> 285.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="178"/>
Such is the manner of life to which nature has reduced it, by bestowing a bill strong enough for prey, but too weak for fight∣ing; cumbrous for use, a mere shapeless exuberance. The external superfluities and defects seem to have affected the mental faculties of the animal: it is melancholy and savage; its aspect is coarse, its attitude heavy.—Bontius' figure is inaccurate.</P>

King fisher. <HI>The Alcyon,</HI> says that philoso∣pher, <HI>is not much larger than a sparrow; its plumage is painted with blue and green, and lightly tinged with purple, these colours are not distinct, but melted together, and shining vari∣ously over the whole body, the wings, and the neck; its bill is yellowish</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is translated <HI>greenish</HI> by Gaza: Scaliger more properly renders it <HI>yellowish.</HI> The primitive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is applied not only to the verdant mead, but to the yellow harvest.

<P>It is equally characterized by the compa∣rison of its natural habits. The Alcyon was solitary and pensive; the King-fisher is seen almost always alone, and the pairing season is of short duration <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Aristotle, while he represents the Alcyon as an inha∣bitant of the sea-shore, relates that it also ascends high up the rivers, and haunts their banks: and there is no reason to doubt, but that the river King-fisher is equally fond of the sea-shore, where it can obtain every convenience suited to its mode of life. The fact is proved by eye-witnesses <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The King-fisher is fond of the brink of the sea and of the little rivulets which flow into it; it feeds on the smallest shell-fish, takes them in its bill, and crushes them by dash∣ing against the pebbles. It seeks also the large worms which abound on the sea-shore. Its flesh smells of musk. <HI>Note accompanying a package from M. Guys.</HI></NOTE>; yet Klein denies it, though he speaks only
<PB N="161" REF="183"/>
of the Baltic Sea, and was little acquainted, as we shall find, with the King-fisher. The Alcyon was not common in Greece or Italy; Choerephon, in Lucian's Dialogues <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dial. Alcyon.</NOTE>, admires its song as a novelty. Aristotle and Pliny say, that the appearance of the Alcyon was rare and fugitive, that it wheeled rapidly round the ships, and in∣stantly retired into its little grot on the shore <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, lib. v. 9. Pliny, lib. v. 9.</NOTE>. This character agrees perfectly with the King-fisher, which is seldom seen.</P>
<P>The King-fisher may be recognized also from the mode in which the Alcyon caught its prey: Lycophron calls it the diver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>, and Oppian says that <HI>it drops perpendicularly, and plunges into the Sea.</HI> This peculiarity of diving vertically has given occasion to the Italian appellation <HI>piombino,</HI> or plummet. Thus all the external characters, and all the natural habits of our King-fisher, are applicable to the Alcyon described by Ari∣stotle. The poets represented the nest of the Alcyon as floating on the surface of the sea: the naturalists have discovered that it has no nest, but drops its eggs in horizon∣tal holes in the brinks of rivers or in the sea-beach.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="184"/>
The love season of the Alcyon, which was placed about the time of the solstice, is the only circumstance that does not coincide with the history of the King fisher, which however breeds early and before the vernal equinox. But, besides that this fable may have been added for embellishment, it is possible that, in a hotter climate, the amours of the King-fisher commenced ear∣lier. There are different opinions too with regard to the time of the Alcyonian days: Aristotle says that in the Grecian Archi∣pelago, they were not always contiguous to the solstice, but more constantly so in the sea of Sicily <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. v.</HI> 8.</NOTE>. Nor did the ancients agree in respect to the number of these days <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Coel. Rhodig, <HI>lect. antiq.</HI> lib. xiv. 11.</NOTE>. And Columella refers them to the Kalends of March, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE> which is the time when our King-fisher begins to hatch.</P>
<P>Aristotle speaks distinctly of one kind only of Alcyon; and it is from a doubtful and probably corrupted passage, where accord∣ing to the correction of Gesner, he treats of two species of Swallows <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. VIII. 3. To <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which Gaza and Niphus translate <HI>Alcedones,</HI> though <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> properly signifies a nightingale. It were better therefore to read with Gesner, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>"the tribe of swallows;"</HI> especially as in the fol∣lowing line, Aristotle begins to speak distinctly of the Alcy∣on as of a different bird.</NOTE>, that natura∣lists
<PB N="163" REF="185"/>
have inferred the existence of two Al∣cyons, the one small and endowed with voice, the other large and dumb. Belon makes the need thrush the <HI>vocal Alcyon,</HI> and the King-fisher the <HI>mute Alcyon,</HI> though its character is quite the reverse.</P>
<P>These critical discussions seemed necessary in a subject which most of the naturalists have left in the greatest obscurity. Klein, who makes the same remark, only increa∣ses the confusion, by ascribing to the King∣fisher two toes before and two behind. He appeals to Schwenckfield, who has fallen into the same error <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This error was first propagated by Albertus, as Aldro∣vandus remarks, while he rectifies it.</NOTE>, and to a bad figure of Belon, which however that naturalist has himself corrected, by describing accurately the foot of this bird, which is singular. Of the three fore toes, the outer one is closely connected to that of the middle as far as the third joint, so as apparently to make only one toe, which forms below a broad flat sole; the inner toe is very short, more so than the hind one; the legs are also very short; the head is large; the bill long, thick at the base, tapered straight to a point; the tail is commonly short in this genus.</P>
<P>It is the handsomest bird in our climates; none in Europe can compare with the King-
<PB N="164" REF="186"/>
fisher in the elegance, the richness, and the luxuriance of colours; it has all the shades of the rainbow, the brilliancy of enamel, and the glossy softness of silk: all the mid∣dle of the back, with the upper surface of the tail, is light blue and brilliant, which, in the sun has the play of sapphire, and the lustre of turquois stone; green is mixed on the wings with blue, and most of the feathers are terminated and dotted with the tints of beryl; the head and the upper side of the neck are dotted in the same manner, with lighter specks on an azure ground. Gesner compares the glowing yellow-red, which colours the breast, to the red glare of a burning coal.</P>
<P>It would seem that the King-fisher has strayed from those climates where the sun pours incessant torrents of the purest light, and sheds all the treasures of the richest colours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"There is a species of King-fisher common in all the islands of the South Sea: we have remarked that its plumage is much more brilliant between the tropics, than in the regi∣ons situated beyond the temperate zone, as in New Zealand."

There are twenty species in Africa and in Asia, and we are acquainted with eight more, that are settled in the warm parts of America. Even the European King-fisher is scattered through Asia and Africa; for many King fishers sent from China and Egypt are found to be the same with ours, and Belon says that he met with them in Greece <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nat. des Oiseaux, p. 220.</NOTE>, and in Thrace <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The banks of the river Hebrus, (now Melissa) are in some places pretty high, where the river-alcyons, vulgarly called the <HI>martinets pêcheurs</HI> (King-fishers), make their nests." Id. <HI>Observations,</HI> p. 63. The King fisher is probably not found in Sweden, since Linnaeus does not mention it: but we are more surprized that he places in that northern cli∣mate the <HI>Bee-eater,</HI> which is little known in France, and even rare in Italy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird, though it derives its origin from the hottest climates, is reconciled to the ri∣gours of our seasons. It is seen in the winter along the brooks, diving under the ice and emerging with its fishy-prey <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld, Gesner, Olina.</NOTE>. Hence the Germans have called it <HI>Eissvogel,</HI> or Ice∣bird <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>; and Belon is mistaken in asserting that it is only migratory in our climates.</P>
<P>It spins with a rapid flight; it usually traces the windings of the rivulets, razing the surface of the water. It screams while on the wing <HI>ki, ki, ki, ki,</HI> with a shrill voice, which makes the banks to resound.
<PB N="166" REF="188"/>
In spring, it has another song which may be heard through the murmur of the stream, or the noisy dashing of the cascade <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The name <HI>Ispida</HI> is, according to the author <HI>de natura rerum,</HI> in Gesner, formed from the cry of the bird; probably from the first.</NOTE>. It is very shy, and escapes to a distance; it sits on a branch projecting over the current; there is remains motionless, and often watches whole hours to catch the moment when a little fish springs under its station; it dives perpendicularly into the water, where it continues several seconds, and then brings up the fish; which it carries to land, beats to death, and then swal∣lows it.</P>
<P>When the King-fisher cannot find a projecting bough, it sits on some stone near the brink, or even on the gravel; but the moment it perceives the little fish, it takes a spring of twelve or fifteen feet and drops perpendicularly from that height. Often it is observed to stop short in its rapid course and remain still, hovering in the same spot for several seconds: such is its manner in winter when the muddy swell of the stream, or the thickness of the ice, constrains it to leave the rivers, and to ply along the sides of the unfrozen brooks: at each pause, it continues as it were suspended at the height of fifteen or twenty feet;
<PB N="167" REF="189"/>
and when it would change its place, it sinks and skims along within a foot of the surface of the water; then rises and halts again. This repeated and almost conti∣nual exercise shows that the bird dives for many small objects, fishes or insects, and often in vain; for, in this way, it travels many a league.</P>
<P>It nestles in the brinks of rivers and brooks, in holes made by the water-rats, or by crabs, which it deepens and fashions; and contracts the aperture. Small fish∣bones and scales are found in it among sand, but without any arrangement, and here its eggs are deposited: though we cannot find those little pellets with which Belon says it plasters its nest, or trace the form imputed to it by Aristotle, who compares this nest to a gourd, and its substance and texture to those sea-balls or lumps of interwoven filaments which cut with difficulty, but when dried become friable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Sea-spume. <HI>Hist.

<PB N="168" REF="190"/>
were the production of the Salangane or esculent Swallow.</P>
<P>The King-fishers begin to frequent their hole in the month of March; and at this time the male is observed in ardent pursuit of the female. The ancients believed that the Alcyons were extremely amorous, for they relate that the male expires in the embrace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tzetzes, and the Scholiast of Aristophanes.</NOTE>; and Aristotle asserts that they begin to breed when only four months old <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. ix. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The species of our King-fisher is not nu∣merous, though these birds have six, seven, or even nine in a hatch, according to Ges∣ner. Their mode of life proves often fatal, nor do they always with impunity brave the rigours of our winters, for they are found dead under the ice. Olina describes the method of catching them at day break, or in the dusk of the evening, by setting a trap at the edge of the water; he adds, that they live four or five years. We only know that they may be kept some time in rooms, where are placed basons of water full of smallfish <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vosmaér.</NOTE>. M. Daubenton, of the Academy of Sciences, fed some for several months, by giving them every day young fry, which is
<PB N="169" REF="191"/>
their only proper nourishment: for four King fishers were brought to me on the twenty first of August, 1778; which were as large as their parents, though taken out of their hole in the bank of a river, and two of these constantly rejected flies, ants, earth worms, paste and cheese, and died of hunger in two days; the two others ate a little cheese and some earth-worms, but lived only six days. Gesner observes that the King fisher can never be tamed, and is always equally wild. Its flesh has the odour of bastard musk <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tragus.</NOTE>, and is unpalatable food; its fat is reddish <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>; its stomach is roomy and flaccid, as in the birds of prey; and like them too it discharges by the bill the indigested fragments, scales and bones rolled into small balls: the stomach is placed very low, and consequently the aesophagus is very long <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>; the tongue is short, of a red or yellow colour, like the inside and the bottom of the bill <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>"On the seventh of July, 1771, says M. de Mont∣beillard, I received five young King-fishers (there had been seven of them in the nest by the brink of a rivulet): they ate earth-worms, that were given to them. In these young King-fishers, the outer toe was so closely connected to the middle one as far as the last joint, as to give the appearance rather of a forked toe than of two distinct toes; the tarsus was very short; the head was striped across with black and greenish blue; there were two fire-coloured spots, one on the eyes before, and the other longer under the eyes, which extending behind, becomes white; below the neck, near the back, the blue grows predominant, and a waving band of blue mixed with a little black runs the whole length of the body, and extends to the extremity of the coverts of the tail, where the blue becomes more vivid; the twelve quills of the tail were of an enbrowned blue; the twenty-two quills of the wings were each half brown, and half embrown∣ed blue lengthwise; the breast was rufous shaded with brown; the belly whitish; the under side of the tail rufous inclined to orange; the bill was seventeen lines; the tail was very short, broad, and pointed; the ventricle very ca∣pacious.".</P>

It is singular, that a bird which flies so swiftly and with such continuance, has not broad wings; they are, on the contrary, very small in proportion to its bulk, and we may hence judge of the vast force of the muscles that impel them. For no bird perhaps flies so rapidly; it shoots like an arrow: if it drops a fish from the branch on which it is perched, it often snatches it before it touches the ground. As it seldom sits but on dry branches, it is said to wither the tree on which it settles <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Schwenckseld.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been supposed, that the dried body of the Kingfisher has the property of pre∣serving cloth and woollen stuffs from moths;
<PB N="171" REF="193"/>
and for this reason drapers hang it in their shops. Its smell of bastard musk may perhaps repel those insects, but the effect can be no greater than that of any other kind of penetrating odour. As the body dries easily, it has been alledged that the flesh never putrefies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>. But these imaginary vir∣tues are nothing compared to the wonders related by some authors, who have collected the superstitious notions of the ancients on the subject of the Alcyon: it averted the thunder; it augmented hidden treasure; and though dead it renewed its plumage each season of moulting <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus. <HI>Lib. iii. p.</HI> 621.</NOTE>: it bestows, says Kirannides, on the person who carries it, gracefulness and beauty; it preserves peace at home; it maintains calm at sea; it draws together the fishes in abundance. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">What is singular, they are found also among the Tar∣tars and Siberians. "The Kingfishers are seen over all Siberia, and the feathers of these birds are employed by the Tartars and the Ostiacs, for many superstitious uses. The former pluck them, cast them into water, and carefully preserve such as float; and they pretend, that if with one of these feathers they touch a woman or even her cloaths she will fall in love with them. The Ostiacs take the skin, the bill, and the claws of this bird, and shut them in a purse; and as long as they preserve this sort of amulet, they believe that they have no ill to fear. The person who taught me this mean of living happy, could not forbear shedding tears; he told me that the loss of such a skin that he had, made him lose also his wife and his goods. I told him that such a bird could not be so very rare, since a countryman of his had brought me one, with its skin and its feathers: he was much surprized, and said, that if he had the luck to find one, he would give it to no person." <HI>Voyage en Sibe∣rie,</HI> par M.

<P>This King-fisher came from the Cape of Good Hope. On comparing it with ano∣ther sent from Senegal, and delineated in the <HI>Planches Enluminees,</HI> we cannot help regarding it one of the same species: since
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
the differences which occur in the two figures are inconsiderable; for instance, the black in the Senegal bird is lighter and more dilute; the feathers on the head which are represented lying flat are yet capable of rising to a crest: but the most material disparity is, that it has a larger proportion of white, and the other from the Cape of Good Hope, has a somewhat larger pro∣portion of black. Edwards gives one of these birds sent from Persia; but his figure is defective, and the colours altogether mis∣taken. He tells us indeed that he received it prepared in spirits of wine, and observes himself, that after a long immersion in that liquor the tints of the plumage are greatly weakened and disordered. But it is quite improbable that the black and white varie∣gated King-fisher of Jamaica mentioned by Sloane, of which he gives a figure that merits hardly any attention, is the same species with that of Senegal or of the Cape of Good Hope; yet Brisson makes no scru∣ple in ranging them together. A bird which flies only short distances, and skims along the shores, could never traverse the vast Atlantic Ocean; and nature, so diversified in all her operations, seems never to have repeated any of her forms in the other con∣tinent, but to have fashioned her produc∣tions
<PB N="181" REF="203"/>
after entirely new models. This is most likely an indigenous species, and ap∣propriated entirely to those countries where it occurs; and the same may be the case with the King-fishers seen in those islands which are scattered in the midst of the South Sea, and discovered by the latest navigators. Forster, in his account of Captain Cook's second voyage round the world, observes that they were found in Otaheite, Xuaheine, and Ulietea, which are more than one thousand five hundred leagues distant from any con∣tinent. These King-fishers are of a dull green, with a collar of the same about their white neck. It appears that some of the islanders entertain a superstitious veneration for these birds; and thus, from one end of the world to the other, have marvellous qualities been ascribed to the family of the Alcyons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the afternoon we shot (at Ulietea) some King-fishers.

<P>WE have already found in the Wood∣peckers a singularity of this nature in regard to the number of the toes: this is less surprizing in the family of the King-fishers, where the little inner toe is so short and almost useless, that it may be easily omitted. We are indebted to Sonnerat for the account of this small three-toed King-fisher, which is one of the richest and most brilliant in regard to plumage of the genus: all the upperside of the head and back is of a deep lilac; the feathers of the wings are of a dull indigo, but heightened by a border of vivid and shining blue, which surrounds each feather; all the under∣side of the body is white; the bill and legs are reddish.

<P>THIS is the only species in America which may be termed a <HI>Small King-fisher,</HI> and it is scarce five inches long: all the underside of the body is of a brilliant orange, except a white spot on the throat, another on the stomach, and a deep green zone below the neck in the male, and which is wanting in the female; both of them have a half-collar of orange behind the neck; the head and all the upper sur∣face, are covered with green-gray, and the wings are spotted with small rusty drops near the shoulder and on the great quills which are brown. Edwards, who gives the figure of this bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The little green and orange-coloured King-fisher. <HI>Gleanings,</HI> pl. 245.</NOTE>, says that he could not discover from what country it was brought; but we received it from Cayenne.</P>

<HEAD>The JACAMARS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have formed this name by shorten∣ing the Brasilian appellation <HI>Jacama∣ciri.</HI> These birds differ not from the King-fishers, except that their toes are disposed two before and two behind, while those of the King-fishers are placed three before and one behind. But the Jacamars resemble them in the shape of their body and of their bill, and they are of the same size with the middle species of King-fishers; and this is probably the reason that some authors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards, &amp;c.</NOTE> have ranged them together. Others. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby, Klein, &amp;c.</NOTE> have classed the Jacamars with the Woodpeckers, the disposition of their toes being similar, and the shape of their bill nearly the same, though longer and more slender; but they are discriminated from the Woodpeckers, since their tongue is not longer than their bill, and the feathers of their tail are neither stiff, nor wedge-shaped. It appears there∣fore, that the Jacamars constitute a sepa∣rate genus, which has as great affinity to
<PB N="214" REF="236"/>
the Woodpeckers, perhaps, as to the King-fishers; it contains only two species, which are both natives of the hot climates of America.</P>

In some subjects, the throat is rufous, as well as the belly; in others, the throat is only a little yellowish; the colour of the upperside of the body, also, is more or less brilliant in different specimens, which may be attributed to age or sex.</P>
<P>These birds are found both in Guiana and in Brazil; they inhabit the forests, and prefer the wet places, as affording in most abundance their insect food; they never join in society, but constantly reside in the most sequestered and darkest coverts; their flight, though rapid, is short; they perch on the middle boughs, and remain at rest the whole of the night and the greatest part of the day; they always are alone, and almost perpetually tranquil: yet there is usually a number in the same district, that make re∣sponses in a feeble broken warble, but which is tolerably pleasant.

<P>THIS bird is rather larger than the pre∣ceding, from which it differs by its tail having twelve quills, while in that of the other there are only ten; the two mid∣dle quills of the tail are besides much longer, exceeding the rest two inches and three lines, and measuring in all six inches. It resembles the former Jacamar however in the form of its body and of its bill, and in the disposition of its toes; yet Edwards gives it three toes before and one behind, and this mistake probably has induced him to reckon it a King-fisher. It differs from the first Jacamar by the tints and distribution of its colours, which have nothing common to both but the white on the breast; all the rest of the plumage is of a dull and deep green, in which we distinguish only some orange and violet reflections.</P>

But all their other habits perhaps differ; for they sometimes frequent the cleared grounds, they fly to great distances, and they perch on the tops of trees; they go also in pairs, nor are they so solitary or sedentary as the others; they have not the same warble, but a cry or ra∣ther a soft whistle, which is heard only when near, and is seldom repeated. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Alcedo Paradisea:</HI> "Its two middle tail-quills very long, its body green gold, its feet scansory."</NOTE></P>

<P>SLOANE and Browne are the first who have described one of these birds, which they term <HI>Todus.</HI> But besides this species from Jamaica, we know two or three others, which all seem to be natives of the hot climates of America. The discriminating character of the genus is, that as in the King-fishers and the Manakins, the mid-toe is closely connected, and as it were glued to the outer-toe as far as the third joint, but cohering to the inner-toe in the same way only at the first joint. If we rested on this property therefore, we should class the Todies with the Manakins or King-fishers; but they are distinguished from these and indeed from all other birds, by the form of the bill, which is long, straight, blunt at the end, and flattened above and below, so that they have been called by the Creoles of Guiana, <HI>Little Pallets</HI> or <HI>Little Spatulas.</HI> This singular confirmation of their bill is alone sufficient to constitute a distinct genus.</P>

<P>THIS Tody is not larger than the Gold-Crested Wren, being about four inches long. We shall not here copy the long descriptions given by Browne, Sloane, and Brisson; because it will always be easy to distinguish the bird; for, besides the peculiarity of the bill, the upper side of the body, in the male, is of a dilute blue, and the under side rose colour; and, in the female, the back is of a fine green, and the rest of the plumage similar to that of the male. In both, the bill is reddish, but lighter below and browner above; the legs are gray, and the nails long and hooked. The bird feeds on insects and small worms, and inhabits wet and sequestered spots. The two subjects designed in the <HI>Planches Enlumi∣nees</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="244"/>
were sent us from St. Domingo by M. Chervain, under the name of <HI>Land Par∣rots,</HI> but with the description of the female only. He observes that, in the love season, the male has a feeble, though pleasant, warble; that the female builds her nest on the dry ground, and preferably on the fri∣able mold; and, for that reason, these birds chuse the ravines and water-gullies; they often nestle also in the low galleries of houses, yet always on the ground; they make an excavation with their bill and claws, give it a round form, hollow out the bottom, and place pliant straws, dry moss, cotton, and feathers, which they artfully arrange; they lay four or five eggs, which are gray and spotted with deep yellow.</P>
<P>They catch, with great dexterity, flies and other small winged insects; they are difficult to tame, yet we may succeed if they are young, and fed by their parents in a cage until they can eat by themselves; they have a strong attachment to their brood, and will not leave them as long as they hear them cry.</P>
<P>We have seen that Sloane and Browne found this bird in Jamaica; it occurs also in Martinico, whence M. de Chanvalon sent it to M. de Reaumur. It appears therefore
<PB N="221" REF="245"/>
that this species inhabits the islands and continent in the warmest parts of North America; but we cannot discover whether it also resides in South America, at least Marcgrave makes no mention of it. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Todus Viridis:</HI> "It is green, its breast red."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE natives of Guiana call this bird <HI>Tic-tic,</HI> in imitation of its cry; it is as small as the preceding, which it resembles exactly in the shape of its bill, and in the conformation of its toes; it differs in its colours, being cinereous mixed with deep blue on the upper side of the body, whereas the former is of a light sky-blue on the same parts: this difference in the shade of the colours would only mark a variety; but all the under side of the body is yellow, there is no rose-colour on the throat or on the flanks, and as the bird belongs to a different climate, we reckon it a distinct
<PB N="222" REF="246"/>
species. It differs from the North Ameri∣can Tody, also, because the tips of the lateral quills of the tail are white, for the space of five or six lines; yet this property is peculiar to the male, for in the female, the extreme quills are of an uniform colour, and of the same ash·gray with the upper side of the body; all these tints are also sainter and more dilute than in the male.</P>
<P>This bird lives on insects, like the pre∣ceding; it prefers the cleared grounds for its haunts; it is scarcely ever found in the forests, but often among thickets and bushes. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Todus Cinereus:</HI> "It is cinerous, below yellow."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The AQUATIC BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Aquatic are the only class of birds, which, to their common inheritance of the air and of the earth, join also the possession of the sea. Numerous species, containing vast multitudes of individuals, inhabit its shores and its level surface; they float on the billows with as much ease and with more security than they soar in their native element. Their provisions are ever abundant, their prey cannot escape their pursuit: some plunge into the waves, others only sweep the face of the water: all of them dwell on the fluctuating face of the deep, as if it were a stable abode; they form a great society, and live in tranquillity amidst the storms: they seem even to play with the billows, to contend with the winds, and to expose themselves to the vehemence of the tempest, without apprehending or suffering shipwreck.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance that they leave their favourite residence, and never until the concerns of incubation detain them on shore, or permit only short excursions into the sea; but, as soon as their young are
<PB N="225" REF="249"/>
hatched, they introduce them into their proper element: there, they may continue as long as they chuse; no water can penetrate their plumage, and when fatigued by flying, they may recruit their exhausted vigor by resting on the surface. The long dark nights, or the continued violence of storms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The disorder of the elements (in a great storm) drove not the birds from us: from time to time a <HI>Black Tern</HI> fluttered on the troubled face of the sea, and broke the force of the waves by exposing itself to their action. The aspect of the ocean was then threatning and terrible." <HI>Forster.</HI></NOTE> are the only hardships to which they are exposed, and which at times oblige them to retire to the shore. Then they announce to the navigator the proximity of the land, and serve, by their flight, to guide his course. Yet Captain Cook advises to regard the appearance of these birds as no certain sign <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The Blue Petrels which are found on this immense sea are no less insensible to cold than the Penquins. We have seen them between New Zealand and America, more than seven hundred leagues from any land." <HI>Forster.</HI> "We fre∣quently had occasion to remark that these birds give not more certain signs of land than the sea-weed, except those species which never rove very far from the coasts. With regard to the Penquins, Petrels, and Albatrosses, as we meet with them six or seven hundred leagues at sea, we cannot reckon at all upon their indication." <HI>Id.</HI></NOTE>, since they often rove at vast dist∣ances on the main; and it appears from the accounts of mariners that the greater
<PB N="226" REF="250"/>
number do not return each night to the beach, but repose among the shelves, or slumber on the water <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"There is reason to suppose that they even sleep upon the water. We passed near an Albatross that was resting asleep on the surface, having been fatigued by the preceding storm." <HI>Forster.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The shape and confirmation of these birds shew sufficiently that they are destined by nature to inhabit the watry element; their body is arched and bulged like the hulk of a ship, and this figure was perhaps copied in the first construction of vessels; their neck, which rises on a projecting breast, represents the prow; their short tail, collected into a single bundle, serves as a rudder <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ii. 5.</NOTE>; their broad and palmated feet perform the office of oars; and their thick down, glistening with oil, which entirely invests them, is impenetrable by humidity, and, at the same time, enables them to float more lightly on the surface of the water <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><P>"The birds of warm countries are moderately cloathed, while those of cold countries, particularly such as fly inces∣santly on the sea, have a prodigious quantity of feathers, each of which is double."</P>
<P>"It is a mistake to ascribe to the <HI>Alcyon</HI> alone the instinct of following vessels: since many sea-birds pass the greatest part of their life on this element, far from the shores, and they can scarce possibly find subsistence during a storm on the troubled face of the deep: they then keep in the vessels wake, often before the wind comes on, and feed upon what is thrown over board. Besides they can repose on the smooth track which the vessel leaves." <HI>Remarks made by the Viscount de Querhoent.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. This <HI>Alcyon</HI> of the mariners is different from the true Alcyon of the ancients or the King-fisher; it is pro∣bably a sea-swallow.</P></NOTE>
The habits and oeconomy of these birds correspond also to their organization; they never seem happy but in their appropriated element; they are
<PB N="227" REF="251"/>
averse to alight on the land; and the least roughness of the ground hurts their soles, which are softened by the perpetual bath∣ing. The water is to them the scene of pleasure and repose, where all their motions are performed with facility, and their vari∣ous evolutions traced with elegance and grace. View the Swans moving sweetly along, or sailing majestically with expanded plumage upon the wave; they gaily sport, they dive and again emerge with gentle un∣dulations, and soft energy expressive of those sentiments which are the foundation of love: the Swan is the emblem of gracefulness, the quality which first commands our atten∣tion, even prior to the fascination of beauty.</P>
<P>The life of the Aquatic Birds therefore is more peaceful and less laborious than that of most other tribes; smaller force is required in swimming than is expended in
<PB N="228" REF="252"/>
flying; and the element which they inhabit perpetually yields them subsistence: they rather light on their prey than search for it, and often a friendly wave conveys it within their reach, and they seize it without trou∣ble or fatigue. Their dispositions also are more innocent, and their habits more pacific. Each species congregates, from mutual at∣tachment; they never attack their compa∣nions nor destroy other birds; and, in this great and peaceful nation, the strong never oppress the weak. Very different from those tyrants of the air and of the land, which spread through their empire disorder, devas∣tation, and war; the winged inhabitants of the water, live in profound harmony with each other, and are never polluted by the blood of their kindred: they respect even the whole class of birds, and employ their strength and their weapons only against the abject swarms of insects, and the dumb tribes of fishes. Yet most of the Aquatic Birds have a keen appetite, and are furnished with arms corresponding. Many species, such as the Goosander, the Brent∣goose, the Shell-drake, &amp;c. have the inner edges of their bill serrated with sharp indentings, the better to secure their prey; all of them almost are more voracious than the land birds, and there are some, as the
<PB N="229" REF="253"/>
Ducks and Gulls, &amp;c. which devour indis∣criminately carrion and entrails.</P>
<P>We must divide the numerous class of Aquatic Birds into two great families: such as swim and have palmated feet; and such as haunt the shores and have divided feet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 16.</NOTE>. The latter are differently shaped, their body being slender and tall, and as their feet are not webbed, they cannot dive or rest on the water; they keep near the margin, and, wading with their tall legs among the sshallows, they search by means of their long neck and bill for their subsistence in the mud: they are a sort of amphibious animals, that occupy the limits between the land and the water, and fill up the gradations in the scale of existence.</P>
<P>Thus the aërial inhabitants consist of three divisions, which have each their sepa∣rate abode: some are appointed by nature to reside on the land; others are destined to sail on the water; and to an intermediate tribe, the confines of these two elements have been allotted: life has been varied in all its possible forms, and the immense rich∣ness of creation displayed to our admira∣tion and astonishment.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="254"/>
We have often had occasion to remark that none of the quadrupeds and few of the birds which inhabit the Southern re∣gions of the one continent, are found in the other; being unable to traverse the vast extent of intervening ocean. But this law entirely fails in the present instance; the Aquatic birds occur equally in the Old and in the New World, and even in the remotest islands of the habitable globe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the articles of the <HI>Flamingos,</HI> of the <HI>Pelican,</HI> of the <HI>Frigat,</HI> of the <HI>Tropic Bird,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. And this privilege is even extended to such as fre∣quent only the shores: for, by tracing the line of coast, they may arrive at the extre∣mities of both continents; nor, in their progress, will they experience much change of climate, since the heat is tempered and the cold mitigated, by the sea-breezes. Accord∣ingly many species of shore birds, which in our continent retire to the North in sum∣mer, seem to have passed by degrees into the boreal tracts of America <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the articles of the <HI>Plovers,</HI> of the <HI>Herons,</HI> of the <HI>Spoon-bills,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Most of these Aquatic birds appear to be half-nocturnal <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>; the Herons roam during the night; the Woodcock only begins to fly in the evening; the Bittern still screams after the decline of day; the Cranes are heard to
<PB N="231" REF="255"/>
cry aloft in the air, admidst the silence and darkness of night; this also is the period when the Gulls range abroad, when the wild Geese and Ducks alight in our rivers, and stay usually longer than during the day. These habits are derived from several cir∣cumstances connected with their support and security: the coolness of the evening en∣tices the worms to come out of their holes; the fishes are then in motion, and the gene∣ral obscurity conceals these birds from their enemies. Yet not always prudent in di∣recting their attacks, they sometimes fall victims of their own rashness or impe∣tuosity. We have found a King-fisher in the belly of an Eel; the Pike often catches the birds that dive or glance over the sur∣face, and even those which come to drink or bathe at the margin of the pool; and, in the frozen seas, the Whales open their enormous jaws, to swallow not only whole columns of Herrings and other fishes, but also the birds which hover in pursuit of these, such as the Albatrosses, the Penguins, and the Scoter Ducks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus nature, while she bestows great privileges on the birds of the water, annexes also to their condition some inconveniences; and she has even withheld from them one of her noblest gifts. None of them has
<PB N="232" REF="256"/>
the power of warbling, and what has been said of the song of the Swan is altogether fabulous. The voice of the Aquatic Birds is strong, harsh, and loud, calculated to be heard at a distance, and to resound on the wide-spread shores: it consists of raucous notes, of cries, and of screams, and has none of those flexible and soft accents, nor that sweet melody with which our rural chanters enliven the grove, when they pro∣claim the delights of spring and of love: as if the formidable element, the scene of storms, had for ever repelled these charm∣ing birds, whose peaceful song required days of serenity and nights of calm; as if the ocean permitted its winged inhabitants to utter nothing but coarse and savage sounds, which pierce through the horrors of the tempest, and are heard amidst the roaring of the blast and the dashing of the surge.</P>
<P>The number of Aquatic birds, including those which haunt the shores, and reckoning the individuals, is perhaps equal to that of the Land-birds. If the latter are dispersed through the hills and the vales, through the forests and the open fields: the former, plying by the edge of the water, or riding on the waves, inhabit a second element as vast and as free as the air itself; their food,
<PB N="233" REF="257"/>
also, is more abundant, and depends not on the caprice of the seasons, or on the produce of human industry. Hence, too, the water birds associate more habitually than the land birds, and form larger flocks; for instance, few species of these, at least of an equal bulk, are so numerous, in the state of nature, as the Geese and the Ducks. In general, there is greater union among animals, the further they are removed from the controul of man.</P>
<P>But both the species and the individuals of the land birds are more plenty in propor∣tion as the climate is hotter; whereas the wa∣ter birds seem to prefer the cold regions. Ma∣riners inform us that the Herring-gulls, the Penguins, and the Scoter-ducks appear in myriads on the frozen shores of the North, as do the Albatrosses, the Manchots, and the Petrels, on the frigid islets in the high southern latitudes.</P>
<P>Yet the birds of the land seem to surpass those of the water in fecundity; none of an equal size are so prolific as the gallina∣ceous tribe. Nor can this difference be attributed to the abundant and generous food which the domestic state affords, for the tame Goose and Duck never lay so many eggs as the common Hen. These Aquatic
<PB N="234" REF="258"/>
birds are rather prisoners than domestics; they still retain the traces of their primaeval liberty, and shew a degree of independence, which the land-fowl seem to have totally lost. They die if kept confined; they re∣quire to roam at large, and enjoy part of their natural freedom in the freshning pools. Nay, if their wings be not clipped, they will often join their wild brethren, and make their escape <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though there are instances of tame Ducks and Geese join∣ing wild ones, they probably meet with harsh usage from their associates: for the antipathy between the domestic and the wild birds subsists in these species as in all others. The Sieur Irecourt, a person of veracity whom I have frequently cited, having put into a pond wild Ducks taken from the nest in a marsh, with other tame Ducks of nearly the same age, the latter assailed them, and in less than two or three days killed them outright.</NOTE>. The Swan, that ornament of the artificial lakes in our superb gardens, sails along rather with the firm dignity of a master than the humble deportment of a slave.</P>
<P>As domestication imposes little constraint on the Aquatic birds, it introduces but slight alterations in their shape or plumage. The tame Duck admits of few varieties; while the Cock presents such a number of new breeds, that they seem almost to con∣found and obliterate the original stock. The birds of the water are also less known than those of the land; and, by placing
<PB N="235" REF="259"/>
them on the ocean, nature seems to have removed them from the empire of man.</P>
<P>The seas which abound most in fish, attract and establish on their shores infinite multitudes of Aquatic birds. Innumerable flocks inhabit the Sambal islands and the coast of the isthmus of Panama, particu∣larly on the Northern side; nor is the Western side of the continent less fre∣quented on the Southern coast, but there are few on the Northern. Wafer assigns for the reason, that in the bay of Panama the fishes are not so plenty as at the Sam∣bal islands. The great rivers of North America are entirely covered with water birds. The settlers at New Orleans, who kill them on the Mississippi, formed a small branch of commerce in the fat or oil extracted from them. Many islands have been called <HI>Bird Islands,</HI> being desert and wholly overspread with sea-fowl. The island of <HI>Aves</HI> among others, fifty leagues to the leeward of Dominica is settled by unequaled numbers. There we find Plo∣vers, Red-shanks, Gallinules, Flamingos, Pelicans, Gulls, Frigats, Boobies, &amp;c. Labat, who publishes these facts, remarks, that this coast is exceedingly rich in fish, and that the high water mark is constantly covered by an immense quantity of shells.
<PB N="236" REF="260"/>

I have myself," says Horrebow, "seen the manner of taking them, and I must confess that I never could behold, without shud∣dering, the intrepidity with which the men risked their lives: several of these people have fallen into the sea, or been dashed against the precipices over which they were obliged to be suspended. On the top of the rock is fastened as firmly as possible, a beam that projects a considerable way: this bears a pulley and a rope, by means of which a man tied by the middle of the body descends along the rocks: he holds a long pole armed with an iron hook, by which he guides himself among the crags. Upon a certain signal being made, the men who are stationed on the summit of the precipice draw him up with his plunder of one or two hundred eggs. The search is continued as long as any eggs can be found, or as long as it is possible to endure this sus∣pension, which becomes very fatiguing. During this em∣ployment, the birds are seen flying in thousands, uttering frightful screams. The inhabitants of those places reap great profit from this species of industry; for besides the eggs, they find many young birds, of which some serve as food, and others yield abundance of feathers, that are sold to the Danish merchants." <HI>Horrebow.—</HI>Pontoppidan describes the search for eggs which is made in Norway, as no less frightful. "The cavities where these birds breed occur in the craggy perpendicular rocks all along the coast. To climb to them, a person puts a rope round his body, while his companions push against his back with a long pole, to help him up to some place where he can rest his foot and fasten his rope; then they withdraw the pole and a second clambers up in the same manner. After they have joined, they both tie themselves to the same rope, and assist each other in mounting higher by means of an iron hook, push∣ing and drawing up each other by turns. The birds suffer themselves to be caught by the hand on their nests in the caverns, and the spoils are thrown to those who wait below the rock in a boat. These fowlers are sometimes eight days absent from their companions, and often tumble toge∣ther into the sea. When they want to enter the hollows of mountains, the boldest is let down by a rope from the top of the rock. He wears a large strong hat, to screen him from the blows of the stones that may fall: when he would enter any cavity, he presses his feet against the mountain, pushes back with all his force, and directs so well his body that he lands straight in." <HI>Hist.

<P>WE have observed that between the land-birds and the sea-birds, which have webbed feet and rest on the surface, there is a large class that haunt the shores, and, being furnished with toes, are destined to tread the ground, but at the same time are enabled, by their long neck and bill, to find their food under the liquid element. Of the numerous families which frequent the sides of rivers and the sea-beach, that of the Stork, which is the best known and the most celebrated, occurs first: if con∣tains two species, the white and the black, which are exactly of the same form, and have no external difference but that of colour. This distinction might be totally
<PB N="244" REF="269"/>
disregarded, were not their instincts and habits widely different. The Black Stork prefers desert tracts, perches on trees, haunts unfrequented marshes, and breeds in the heart of forests. The White Stork, on the contrary, settles beside our dwellings; inhabits towers, chimnies, and ruins: the friend of man, it shares his habitations, and even his domain; it fishes in our rivers, pursues its prey into our gardens, takes up its abode in the midst of cities, without being disturbed by the noise and bustle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witness the Stork's nest built on the temple of Concord in the Capitol, and mentioned by Juvenal, <HI>Sat.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 116, and which is also represented in the medals of Adrian.</NOTE>, and ever respected and welcomed, it repays, by its services, the favours bestowed on it: as it is more civilized, it is also more pro∣lific, more numerous, and more dispersed, than the Black Stork, which appears con∣fined to particular countries, and resides always in the most sequestered spots.</P>
<P>The White Stork is smaller than the Crane, but larger than the Heron; its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is three feet and an half, and to the nails, four feet; the bill, from the tip to the corners, measures seven inches; the leg eight inches; the naked part of the thighs five, and the extent of the
<PB N="245" REF="270"/>
wings is more than six feet. It is easy to form an idea of it; its body is of a bright white, and its wings black, characters which its Greek name expresses <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> black, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> white.</NOTE>; its legs and bill are red, and its long neck is arched: these are the obvious features; but on closer examination, we perceive, on the wings, violet reflections and some brown tints, we may count thirty quills in the wing, when it is spread; they form a double scalloping, those next the body being almost as long as the outer ones, and equal to them when the wing is closed: in that situation, the wings cover the tail; and when they are expanded for flying, the great quills shew a singular disposition; the first eight or nine part from each other, and ap∣pear diverging and detached, so that a space is left between each, a property to be found in no other bird: the feathers below the neck are white, longish, and pendulous; in which respect, the Storks resemble the Herons, but their neck is shorter and thicker: the orbits are naked, and covered with a wrinkled skin of reddish black; the feet are covered with scales in hexagonal tablets, and broader the higher they are placed. There are rudiments of membranes
<PB N="246" REF="271"/>
between the great toe and the inner toe as far as the first joint, which, projecting on the outer toe, seem to form the gradation by which nature passes from the birds that have the feet parted by toes, to those that have them webbed: the nails are blunt, broad, flat, and much like the human nails.</P>
<P>The Stork flies steadily and with vigour, like all the birds furnished with broad wings and a short tail: it holds its head straight forward, and stretches back its legs, to directs its motion <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Lib. ii. 15.</HI></NOTE>: it soars to a vast height, and performs distant journies, even in tempestuous seasons. The Storks arrive in Germany about the eighth or tenth of May <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Klein, <HI>De avibus errat. &amp; migrat.</HI></NOTE>, and are seen before that time in the provinces of France. Gesner says, that they precede the Swallows, and enter Swit∣zerland in the month of April, and some∣times earlier. They arrive in Alsace in March, or even in the end of February. Their return is ever auspicious, as it an∣nounces the spring. They instantly indulge those tender emotions which that season inspires: Aldrovandus paints with warmth their mutual signs of felicity and love, the eager congratulations, and the fondling en∣dearments of the male and female, when they
<PB N="247" REF="272"/>
arrive at their nest after their distant jour∣ney <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">"When they have arrived at their nest . . . . good God! what sweet salutation; what gratulation for their prosperous return! what embraces! what honied kisses! what gen∣tle murmurs they breathe!" <HI>Tom. iii. p. 298.</HI></NOTE>: for the Storks always settle in the same spots, and, if their nest has been destroyed, they rebuild it with twigs and aquatic plants, and usually on lofty ruins, or on the battlements of towers, and some∣times on large trees beside water, or on the point of bold cliffs. In France, it was customary in Belon's time, to place wheels on the house-tops, to entice the Stork to nestle. This practice still subsists in Ger∣many and in Alsace: and in Holland, square boxes are planted on the ridge, with the same view <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lady Montague in her Letters, No. 32. says that the Storks nestle on the ground in the streets. If she is not mistaken with regard to the species of these birds, the pro∣tection which the Stork enjoys in Turkey must have singu∣larly emboldened it; for in our countries, it always chuses the most innaccessible places, which may command the vici∣nity, and conceal it in the nest.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Stork is in a still posture it rests on one foot, folds back its neck, and reclines its head on its shoulder. It watches the motions of reptiles with a keen eye, and commonly preys on frogs, lizards, serpents, and small fish, which it finds in
<PB N="248" REF="273"/>
marshes, by the sides of the streams, and in wet vales.</P>
<P>It walks like the Crane with long mea∣sured strides. When it is irritated or dis∣composed, or even actuated by the amo∣rous passions, it makes with its bill, a repeated clattering, which the ancients express by the significant words <HI>crepitat, glotterat</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zuaeque salutato crepitat concordia nido.</HI> Juvenal, Sat. 1. <HI>Glotterat immenso de turre ciconia rostro.</HI> Aut. Philomel.</NOTE>, and which Petronius accurately marks, by the epithet <HI>crotalistria</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Publius Syrus had made the same application of this word.</NOTE>, formed from <HI>crotalum,</HI> the castanet or rattle. In this state of agitation it bends its head back in such a manner, that the lower mandible appears uppermost, and that the bill lies almost parallel on the back; and in this attitude, the two mandibles strike violently against each other; but in proportion as it raises up its neck, the clattering abates, and ceases when the bird has resumed its ordinary posture. Such is the only noise which the Stork ever makes, and, as it seems dumb, the ancients were probably induced to suppose that it had no tongue <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Lib, x. 31.</HI></NOTE>: this, indeed, is short and concealed in the entrance of the throat, as in all the birds with long bills, which have also a particular
<PB N="249" REF="274"/>
mode of swallowing, they by a certain cast of the head, tossing their food into the throat. Aristotle makes another remark with regard to birds which have long necks and bills, that their excrements are always thinner than those of other birds <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ii. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Stork does not lay more than four eggs, oftner not more than two; they are of a dirty and yellowish white, rather smaller, but longer, than those of a Goose. The male sits when the female goes in quest of food; the incubation lasts a month; both parents are exceedingly attentive in bringing provisions to the young, which rise up to receive it, and make a sort of whistling noise <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aelian says that the Stork vomits food to its young, which must not be understood of aliments partly digested, but of recent prey which it disgorges from its aesophagus, or even from its stomach whose aperture is sufficiently large. See the observation of Peyerus <HI>de ciconiae ventre &amp; affinitate qua∣dam cum ruminantibus. Ephem. Nat. curios. dec. 2. ann. 2. obs. 97.</HI> See also two anatomical descriptions of the Stork, the one by Schelhammer, <HI>Collect. Acad. part etrang.</HI> vol. iv. obs. 109, and the other by Olaus Jacobaeus. <HI>Id. obs. 94.</HI></NOTE>. The male and female never leave the nest at once; but, while the one is employed in searching for its prey, the other stands near the spot on one leg, and keeps an eye constantly on the brood. When first hatched, the young are covered with a brown down, and their
<PB N="250" REF="275"/>
long slender legs not having yet strength enough to support them, they creep upon their knees <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observation of Bishop Grunner. <HI>Mem Soc. of Drontheim.</HI></NOTE>. When their wings begin to grow, they essay their force in fluttering about the nest; though it often happens, that, in this exercise, some of them fall, and are unable to regain their lodgement. After they venture to commit themselves to the air, the mother leads them, and exercises them in small circumvolutions about the nest, whither she conducts them back. And about the latter end of August, the young Storks having now attained strength, join the adults, and prepare for migration. The Greeks have placed their rendezvous in a plain of Asia, called the <HI>Serpent's Dis∣trict,</HI> where they assembled <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pythonos comen, quasi serpentium pagum, vocant in Asiá, patentibus campis, ubi congregatae inter se commurmurant, eam∣que quae novissima advenit lacerant, atque ita abeunt. Nota∣tum post idus augustas non temere visas ibi.</HI> Plin. Lib. x. 31.
<P>From this passage it appears that the assembly of the Storks is not without tumult and even fighting; but that <HI>they tear the last comer,</HI> as Pliny asserts, is doubt a fable.</P></NOTE> as they do now in some parts of the Levant <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">"It is remarked that the Storks before they pass from one country into another, assemble a fortnight beforehand, from all the neighbouring parts, in a plain, holding once a day a <HI>divan,</HI> as they say in that country, as if their object was to fix the precise time of their departure and the place of their retreat." <HI>Shaw's Travels.</HI></NOTE>, and even in Europe, as in Brandenburg and elsewhere.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="276"/>
When they are convened previous to their departure, they make a frequent clattering with their bill, and the whole flock is in tumultuary commotion; all seem eager to form acquaintance, and to consult on their projected rout, of which the signal in our climate is the North wind. Then, the vast body rises at once, and, in a few se∣conds, is lost in the air. Klein relates, that, having been called to witness this sight, he was a moment too late, and that the whole flock had already disappeared. Indeed, this departure is the more difficult to observe, as it is conducted in silence <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Belon says, that it is not remarked, because they fly without noise or cries, while the Cranes and Wild-geese, on the contrary, scream much on the wing.</NOTE>, and often during the night <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nemo vidit agmen discedentium, cum discessurum appareat; nec venire, sed venisse cernimus; utrumque nocturnis fit tempor∣ibus.</HI> Pliny, <HI>Lib. x.</HI> 31.</NOTE>. It is as∣serted, that in their passage, before they venture to cross the Mediterranean, the Storks alight in great numbers in the neigh∣bourhood of Aix <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE> in Provence. Their departure appears to be later in warm countries; for Pliny says, that <HI>after the retreat of the Stork, it is improper to sow</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Post ciconiae discessum male seri.</HI> Lib. viii. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="277"/>
Though the ancients had observed the migrations of the Storks, they were igno∣rant of the countries to which they retired <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah viii. 7.</NOTE>. Some modern travellers have made good observations on that subject: in autumn the plains of Egypt are entirely covered with these birds. "It is perfectly ascer∣tained, says Belon, that the Storks winter in Egypt, and in Africa; for we have seen the plains of Egypt whitened by them in the months of September and October. At that season, when the waters of the Nile have subsided, they obtain abundance of food; but the excessive heats of summer drive them to more temperate climates; and they return again in winter, to avoid the severity of the cold; the contrary is the case with the Cranes, which visit us with the Geese in winter, when the Storks leave us." This remarkable difference is owing to that of the climates which these birds inhabit; the Geese and Ducks come from the North, to escape the rigors of the win∣ter; the Storks leave the South, to avoid the scorching heats of summer <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Several authors pretend that the Storks do not retire in winter, but then lurk in caverns, or even at the bottom of lakes. This was the common opinion in the time of Alber∣tus Magnus. Klein relates, that two Storks were dragged out of the water in the pools near Elbing <HI>(De avibus errat. &amp; migrat. ad calcem.)</HI> Gervais of Tillebury <HI>(Epist. ad Othon iv.)</HI> speaks of other Storks that were found clustered in a lake near Arles; Merula in Aldrovandus speak of those which fishermen drew out of the lake of Como; and Fulgosus, of others that were fished near Metz <HI>(Memorab. lib. i. cap.</HI> 6.) Martin Schoockius, who wrote a small treatise on the Stork, printed at Groningen in 1648, supports these testimonies. But the history of the migrations of the Storks is too well known, not to attribute to accidents the facts just men∣tioned, if they indeed may be relied on. See further the Article of the Swallow.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="278"/>
Belon says also, that he saw them win∣tering round Mount Amanus near Antioch, and passing about the end of August towards Abydus, in flocks of three or four thousand, from Russia and Tartary. They cross the Hellespont; and on the summits of Tenedos, they divide into squadrons, and disperse themselves Northwards.</P>
<P>Dr. Shaw saw at the foot of Mount-Carmel, a flight of Storks from Egypt to Asia; about the middle of May 1722. "Our vessel, says that traveller, being an∣chored under Mount Carmel, I saw three flocks of Storks, each of which was more than three hours in passing, and extended a half mile in breadth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He adds; "These Storks came from Egypt, because the channel of the Nile and the marshes which it makes annually, being dried, they retire to the North East." But this au∣thor is mistaken; the Storks rather flee from the inunda∣tion which covers the whole country; the river having no banks after the end of April.</NOTE>." Maillet says,
<PB N="254" REF="279"/>
that he saw the Storks descend towards the end of April from Upper Egypt, and halt on the grounds of the Delta, which the inundation of the Nile soon obliges them to leave <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Some Crows intermingle at times with the Storks in their passage, which has given rise to the opinion of St. Basi∣lius and Isidorus, that the Crows serve to direct and escort the Storks. The ancients have also spoken much of the combats between the Storks and the Ravens, the Jays, and other species of birds, when their flocks returning from Lybia and Egypt, met about Lycia and the river Xanthus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These birds which thus remové from climate to climate, never experience the rigors of winter; their year consists of two summers, and twice they taste the pleasures of the season of love. This is a remark∣able peculiarity of their history, and Belon positively assures us that the Stork has its second brood in Egypt.</P>
<P>It is said, that Storks are never seen in England, unless they are driven upon the island by some storm. Albin remarks as a singular circumstance, that there were two of these birds at Edgware in Middlesex, and Willughby declares, that the figure which he gives was designed from one sent from the coast of Norfolk, where it had accidently dropped. Nor does the Stork occur in Scotland, if we judge from the silence of Sibbald. Yet it often pene∣trates into the Northern countries of Eu∣rope;
<PB N="255" REF="280"/>
it is found in Sweden, according to Linnaeus, and over the whole of Scania, in Denmark, Siberia, at Mangasea on the river Jenisca, and as far as the territories of the Jakutes <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gmelin. <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom. xviii. p.</HI> 300.</NOTE>. Great numbers of Storks are seen also in Hungary <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Marsigli.</NOTE>, in Poland and Li∣thuania <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>; they are met with in Turkey, and in Persia, where Bruyn observed their nest carved on the ruins of Persepolis; and ac∣cording to that author, they are dispersed through the whole of Asia, except the desert parts, which they seem to shun, and the arid tracts, where they cannot subsist.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus assures us, that Storks are never found in the territory of Bologna; they are rare even through the whole of Italy, where Willughby during a residence of twenty-eight years saw them only once, and where Aldrovandus owns he never saw them. Yet it appears, from Pliny and Varro, that anciently they were common; and we can hardly doubt, but that in their rout from Germany to Africa, or in their return, they must pass over Italy and the islands of the Mediterranean. Koempfer says, that the Storks reside the whole year in Japan; that would be the only country where they are stationary; in all others, they retire a few months after their arrival.

<P>The Stork is of a mild disposition, nei∣ther shy nor savage; it is easily tamed; and may be trained to reside in our gardens, which it will clear of insects and reptiles. It seems to have an idea of cleanliness, for it seeks the by-corners to lay its excre∣ments. It has almost always a grave air, and a mournful visage; yet, when roused by example, it shews a certain degree of gaiety, for it joins the frolics of children, hopping and playing with them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I saw in a garden, where the children were playing at hide and seek, a tame Stork join the party, run its turn when touched, and distinguish the child, whose turn it was to pursue the rest, so well as to be on its guard." <HI>Notes on the Stork by Dr. Hermann of Strasburg.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>THOUGH, in all languages this bird is termed the <HI>Black Stork,</HI> it derives its epithet rather from the opposition to the White Stork, than from the dye of its plu∣mage, which is generally brown mixed with fine changeable colours.</P>
<P>The back, the rump, the shoulders, and the coverts of the wings, are of a brown, which varies with violet and gold green; the breast, the belly, and the thighs, are cloathed with white feathers, and of the same colour are the coverts under the tail, which consists of twelve brown quills chang∣ing with violet and green; the wing con∣tains thirty quills, which are of a varying brown, the green predominating in the first ten, and the violet in the remaining twenty; the feathers at the origin of the neck are of a brown glossed with violet, and washed with grayish at the tips: the throat and neck are covered with small
<PB N="262" REF="287"/>
brown feathers, terminated by a whitish point; but this character is wanting in some individuals; the top of the head is brown, mixed with a violet gloss and gold green: the eye is encircled by a very red skin, the bill, too, is red, and the naked part of the thighs, the legs, and the nails, are of the same colour; yet that property seems to admit some variety, for several naturalists, as Willughby, make the bill to be green∣ish like the legs: it is only a slight degree smaller than the White Stork, its alar ex∣tent being five feet six inches.</P>
<P>Savage and solitary, the Black Stork shons our habitations, and haunts only the desert fens; it nestles in the heart of the woods, on old trees, especially on lofty pines. It is common in the Swiss Alps; it is seen by the edge of the lakes, watching its prey, flying on the surface of the water, and sometimes diving hastily for fish: yet it does not depend on that mode of subsisting only; it gathers insects among the herbage and the mountain dales; vestiges of cater∣pillars and grasshoppers are found in its stomach. When Pliny says, that the Ibis occurs in the Alps, he mistook the Black Stork for that Egyptian bird.</P>

<P>THE Maguari is a large bird which in∣habits the hot parts of America, and was first described by Marcgrave. It is of the bulk of the Stork, and, like it, clatters with its bill, which is long and straight, greenish at the root, bluish at the point, and nine inches in length. All the body, the head, the neck, and the tail, are invested with white feathers, which below the neck are of a considerable length and pendulous; the quills and the great coverts of the wing are black glossed with green, and when it is closed, the quills next the body appear equal to the exterior ones, a property com∣mon to all the Marsh-birds; the orbits are naked and covered with a bright red skin;
<PB N="266" REF="291"/>
the throat also is sheathed with a skin, which may be inflated and formed into a bag; the eye is small and sparkling, the iris of a sil∣very white; the naked part of the thighs and legs, red: the nails of the same colour, broad and flat. We know not whe her this bird migrates like the Stork, which it represents in the New World. The nature of the climate would seem to render the change of residence unnecessary both to the Ma∣guari, and all the other birds of those coun∣tries, where the seasons are constantly uni∣form, and the earth, teeming with unceas∣ing fertility, presents them a perpetual repast. We are ignorant, too of all the other habitudes of this bird, and indeed of almost all the facts relating to the natu∣ral history of those vast regions of America.</P>
<P>But can we complain of this neglect, or even wonder at it, when we reflect on the character of the people, whom Europe has, for ages past, sent into the new climates; men, whose eyes are shut to the beauties of nature, and whose hearts are still more impenetrable to the sentiments which the contemplation of it inspires.</P>

<P>THIS bird is a native of Guiana, of Brasil, and of some countries of North America, which it visits. It is as large as the Stork, but its body is more slender and longer shaped; nor would it reach the height of the Stork, but for the length of its neck and legs, which are larger in proportion: it differs also by the shape of its bill, which is straight three fourths of its length, but curved at the point, very strong and thick, not furrowed, and of an even roundness, gradually enlarging as it approaches the head, where it is six or seven inches in girth, and near eight inches long; and this large bill is of a very hard sub∣stance, and sharp at the edges: the back of the head and the arch of the neck are covered with small brown feathers, stiff, though loose: the quills of the wing and of the tail are black, with some bluish or reddish re∣flections; all the rest of the plumage is
<PB N="268" REF="293"/>
white: the front is bald, and only covered, like the orbits, by a dull blue skin: the throat, which is equally naked of feathers, is invested with a skin capable of inflation and extension; which has induced Catesby to term it, very improperly, <HI>the Wood Pelican</HI> In fact, the small bag of the Couricaca differs little from that of the Stork, which also can dilate the skin of its throat; whereas the Pelican carries a large sac under its bill, and, besides has its feet pal∣mated. Brisson has committed an over∣sight in referring the Couricaca to the ge∣nus of Curlews, to which it bears no sort of resemblance. Piso appears to be the cause of this error, by the comparison which he draws between this bird and the <HI>Indian Curlew of Clusius,</HI> which is the Red Curlew, (Scarlet Ibis, <HI>Lath.)</HI> and this mistake is the less pardonable, as in the preceding line, Piso had represented it as equal in bulk to the Swan. He had better reason to compare its bill to that of the Ibis, which differs in fact from the bill of the Curlews.</P>
<P>This large bird is, according to Marc∣grave, frequent on the river of Seregippa or of St. François. It was sent to us from Guiana, and it is the same with what Barrere denominates <HI>the Curved Bill Crane,</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="294"/>

<P>Catesby tells us, that every year, nume∣rous flocks of Couricacas arrive in Caro∣lina about the end of summer, which is the rainy season in that country. They haunt the Savannas, which are now over∣flowed; they sit in great numbers on the tall cypresses. Their altitude is very erect, and their ponderous bill is supported by resting it on their neck reclined. They retire before the month of November.

<P>As nature has multiplied the reptiles on the low grounds overflowed by the waters of the Amazon and of the Oro∣nooco, she has also created birds to destroy these pernicious creatures: she seems even to have proportioned their strength to that of the enormous serpents which they are destined to combat, and their stature to the depth of the mud where they are appointed to wade. One of these birds is the Jabiru, which is much larger than the Stork, taller than the Crane and twice as thick; and, if force and magnitude confer precedence it may be ranked the first of the inhabitants of the marsh.</P>
<P>The bill of the Jabiru is a powerful weapon; it is thirteen inches long, and three inches broad at the base; it is sharp, and flat, and edged at the sides, like a hatchet, fixed into a large head, and supported by a thick and nervous neck; this bill consists of hard

<PB N="271" REF="297"/>
horn, and is slightly bent upwards; a cha∣racter of which the first trace may be per∣ceived in the bill of the Black Stork: the head, and two-thirds of the neck of the Jabiru, are covered with a black naked skin, shaded on the occiput with several gray hairs; the skin under the neck, for a length of four or five inches, is of a vivid red, and forms a broad and beautiful collar, the plumage of the bird being entirely white; the bill is black; the thighs stout, covered with large scales, black like the bill, and featherless for the space of five inches, the leg is thirteen inches; a membranous ligament appears on the toes, and connects more than an inch and half of the outer toe to the inner one.</P>
<P>Willughby says, that the Jabiru is at least as large as the Swan; which is true, con∣sidering, however, that the Swan is of a longer and more slender shape, and that the Jabiru has exceeding tall legs. He adds, that its neck is as thick as a man's arm; which is likewise true. But that author mentions, that the skin on the back of the neck is white, and not red; which may be owing to the difference between the dead and the living subject. The tail is broad, and extends not beyond the closed wings; the bird, when standing, is at least four
<PB N="272" REF="298"/>
feet and an half in perpendicular height, and if extended, it would, considering the length of the bill, measure near six feet. It is the largest bird in Guiana.</P>
<P>Johnston and Willughby have only co∣pied Marcgrave on the subject of the Ja∣biru; they have even copied his figures with all their faults: and there is in Marc∣grave a confusion, or rather a mistake of the editor, which our nomenclators, far from correcting, have really increased. We shall endeavour to clear up the matter.</P>
<P>"The Jabiru of the Brasilians, which the Dutch term <HI>negro,</HI> says Marcgrave, has a thicker and even a longer body than the Swan; the neck is as thick as a man's arm; the head proportionally large; the eye black; the bill black, straight, twelve inches long, two and an half broad, sharp at the edges; the upper mandible a little raised, and stronger than the lower; all the bill is slightly curved upwards."</P>
<P>These characters are alone sufficient to mark out the Jabiru of Guiana, which we have just described from nature. But we are surprized to find in Marcgrave, under the foregoing account, the figure of a bird with a slender body, and a bill arched downwards; in short, except the thick∣ness of its neck, differing in every respect
<PB N="273" REF="299"/>
from his description. On casting our eyes however on the other page, we perceive under his <HI>Jabiru Guacu Petiguarensibus,</HI> or <HI>Nhandu Apoa Tupinambis,</HI> which, he says, <HI>is of the bulk of the Stork, and its bill arched downwards,</HI> a large bird in an erect posture, with a thick body, and with a bill arched upwards, and which we readily discover to be the Great Jabiru, the real subject of the preceding description, except only the thick∣ness of the neck, which is not represented in the figure. Here therefore is a double mistake, one in the engraving, and another in the transposition; so that the thick neck of the Jabiru has been given to the <HI>Nhandu Apoa,</HI> which has been placed below the description of the Jabiru, while the figure of this bird has been placed below the de∣scription of the <HI>Nhandu Apoa.</HI></P>
<P>All that Marcgrave subjoins serves to point out this mistake, and prove the just∣ness of our remark. The Jabiru, he tells us, has strong legs, black and scaly, and two feet high; all the body is covered with white feathers; the neck is naked, two-thirds covered with black skin from the head, and forming below a circle, which he asserts to be white, but which we believe is red in the living bird:—This is precisely the character, in all its features,

Piso has fallen into no such mistake as Marc∣grave; he gives the true figure of the Great Jabiru under its true name of <HI>Jabiru Guacu,</HI> and he says that it occurs at the sides of lakes and rivers in remote places; that its flesh, though commonly very dry, is palatable. This bird grows fat in the rainy season, and then the Indians feast on it; they easily kill it with a fowling piece, or even with their arrows. Piso also remarks in the quills of the wings a red reflection, which we could not perceive in the bird sent us from Cayenne, but which may appear in the Jabiru of Brazil.</P>

<P>THIS bird, which is much smaller than the Jabiru, has however been termed the Great Jabiru <HI>(Jabiru Guacu)</HI> in some countries, where the true Jabiru was pro∣bably still unknown: but its real Brasilian name is <HI>Nandapoa.</HI> Like the Jabiru, it is featherless on the head, and on the top of the neck, and covered only by a scaly skin: It is distinguished from that bird by its bill being <HI>arched downwards,</HI> and only seven inches long. This bird is nearly of the bulk of the Stork; the crown of the head is cover∣ed by a bony protuberance of grayish white; the eyes are black; the ears are large and wide; the neck is ten inches long; the thighs are eight, and the legs six, and they are of an ash colour; the quills of the wing and of the tail, which does project beyond the wing, are black, with a reflection of a fine red in those of the wing; the rest of the plumage is white; the feathers below the neck are somewhat long and pendant. The flesh of this bird has a pleasant taste, and is eaten after it is skinned.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="304"/>
It is evident that this second description of Marcgrave suits his first figure, in the same manner as his second one corresponds to the description of the Brasilian Jabiru, or our Great Jabiru of Guiana, which is undoubtedly the same bird.

<P>These ancient fables <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are anterior to the time of Homer, who com∣pares <HI>(Iliad III.)</HI> the Trojans to the Cranes fighting cla∣mourously with the Pygmies.</NOTE> are absurd, it will be said; and I will allow it: but popular traditions generally contain important facts, though obscured by exaggeration, or con∣cealed under the veil of allegory. I am therefore strongly disposed to believe, that this story alludes to some singularities in the history of the Crane. It is well known that the apes, which rove in large bodies in most parts of Africa and India, wage continual war with the birds; they seek to surprize them in the nest, and lay perpetual snares for them. The Cranes, on their arrival, find these enemies assembled, perhaps in numbers to attack, with more advantage, their new and rich prey. The Cranes, confident in their own strength, enured to fight by their disputes with each other, and naturally prone to combat <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The Cranes fight so obstinately with each other, that they may be caught while engaged." Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 12.</NOTE>, as their atti∣tudes, their movements, and the order with which they marshal, sufficiently evince,
<PB N="281" REF="310"/>
make a vigorous defence. But the apes, obstinately bent on plundering the eggs and the young, return repeatedly in troops to renew the battle; and as, by their subtlety, their gait and posture, they imitate human actions, they appeared a band of little men to the rude spectators, who viewed them from a distance, or who, captivated by the marvellous, chose to embellish their rela∣tions <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This is not the first time that troops of apes have been taken for hordes of Barbarians; not to mention the battle which the Carthaginians fought with the Orang-Outangs on the coast of Africa, and the skins of three females hung up in the temple of Juno at Carthage as the skins of three wild women <HI>(Hanno's Periplus,</HI> Hague 1677, p. 77) Alex∣ander, in his march through India, would have fallen into this error, and have sent his phalanx against an army of Pongos, it king Taxilus had not undeceived him, by re∣marking to him, that this multitude which he saw follow∣ing on the heights consisted of peaceful animals, attracted by curiosity; but, in fact, far less senseless and less bloody than the plunderers of Asia. See Strabo, <HI>Lib.</HI> xv.</NOTE>—Such is the origin and history of these fables.</P>
<P>The Cranes fly very lofty, and arrange themselves for their expedition; they form a triangle, almost isosceles, the better to cleave the air. When the wind freshens, and threatens to break their ranks, they collect their force into a circle; and they adopt the same disposition when the Eagle attacks them. Their voyage is oftenest per∣formed in the night; but their loud screams
<PB N="282" REF="311"/>
betray their course. During this nocturnal passage, the leader frequently calls to rally his forces, and point out the track; and the cry is repeated by the flock, each an∣swering, to give notice that it follows and keeps its rank.</P>
<P>The flight of the Crane is always sup∣ported uniformly, though it is marked by different inflections; and these variations have been observed to indicate the change of weather: a sagacity that may well be allowed to a bird, which, by the vast height to which it soars, is able to perceive or to feel the distant alterations and motions in the atmosphere <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, Lib. ix. 10.</NOTE>. The cries of the Cranes during the day forebode rain; and noisy tumultuary screams announce a storm: if in the morning or evening they rise up∣wards, and fly peacefully in a body, it is a sign of fine weather; but if they keep low, or alight on the ground, it menaces a tempest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>. Like all other large birds, except the rapacious tribe, the Crane has much difficulty in commencing its flight. It runs a few steps, opens its wings, mounts a little way, and then, having clear space, it displays its vigorous and rapid pinions.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="312"/>
When the Cranes are assembled on the ground, they set guards during the night; and the circumspection of these birds has been consecrated in the hieroglyphics, as the symbol of vigilance. The flock sleep with their head concealed under their wing, but the leader watches with his head erect, and if any thing alarms him, he gives no∣tice by a cry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id. ibid.</HI> Also Pliny, <HI>Lib.</HI> x. 30.</NOTE>. It is to direct their retreat, says Pliny, that this leader is chosen <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. x.</HI> 30.</NOTE>. But without supposing an authority confer∣red, as in human societies, we must allow that these animals are prompted by social instinct to congregate, and to follow the one which calls, which precedes, or which regulates their course.

But I know not what degree of credit is due to the assertion of these Zoologists: no reason appears why the Cranes should have forsaken England, nor have these authors told us whether the fens in the counties of Cambridge and Lincoln have been drained.

<P>Though the Crane is granivorous, as the conformation of its stomach seems to indi∣cate, and as it generally arrives after the grounds are sowed to gather the seeds which

<P><PB N="289" REF="318"/>
The Crane has an erect gait, and a slen∣der figure; the whole field of its plumage is of a fine waved light ash-colour, except the tips of the wings and the covering of the head; the great quills of the wing are black; those next the body extend beyond the tail; the middle and great coverts are of a pretty light ash-colour on the outside, and black on the inside, as well as at the point; from under the last and nearest the body, rise broad unwebbed feathers, which swell into a tuft, and fall back gracefully, and by their flexibility, their position, and their texture, resemble the plumes of the Ostrich; the bill measures four inches from the tip to the corners; it is straight, pointed, compressed at the sides <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It has given name to the plant <HI>Geranium</HI> or <HI>Crane's-bill,</HI> which, in all its species, bears this character of fructifi∣cation.</NOTE>; its colour is of a greenish black which whitens at the tip: the tongue is broad and short, hard and horny at the end: before the eyes, and on the front and the skull, there are black hairs so thinly scattered that those parts appear almost bare: that skin is red in the living animal; a difference which Belon marks between the male and female,
<PB N="290" REF="319"/>
in which it is not red: some feathers of a very deep ash colour cover the back of the head, and extend a little on the neck: the temples are white, and this colour descends three or four inches from the top of the neck: the cheeks, from the bill and below the eyes, and also the throat and a part of the foreside of the neck, are of a blackish ash-colour.</P>
<P>White Cranes sometimes occur; Longo∣lius and others say that they have seen them. These are only varieties of the species, which admits also of very considerable dif∣ferences in regard to bulk. Brisson states the length of his Crane, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, to be three feet and an inch, and measured to the toes, three feet nine inches: he describes there∣fore a very small bird <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynski appears to admit two families of Cranes; to the smaller one he attributes some particular properties, which do not seem however to constitute a different species; the lesser Cranes bear crests hoary behind the ears, but blackish under the throat. The small breed occurs in Vol∣hinia and in the Ukraine; the large one in Cujavia, and both together in Podolia.</NOTE>. Willughby makes his to be five English feet, and says that it weighs ten pounds; in which, Ornitho∣logists agree with him. In the King's cabi∣net, there is a Crane, reckoned indeed among the largest, which is four feet two
<PB N="291" REF="320"/>
inches in perpendicular height, and if spread out, would measure more than five feet between the tip of the bill and the toes; the naked part of the thighs is four inches, the legs are black, and only ten inches and a half.</P>
<P>Considering its force of wing and its migratory instinct, we cannot be surprized that the Crane should visit every climate. Yet we suspect that it never advances fur∣ther South than the tropic: all the coun∣tries where the ancients placed the winter residence of the Crane, Lybia, the regions situate at the origin of the Nile, of the Indus, and of the Ganges, are within this limit, which also bounded the Geography of antiquity. The Cranes, natives of the North, seek only a moderate degree of tem∣perature, and not the scorching heats of the Torrid Zone. The fens which invite them never occur in the midst of arid plains and burning sands; and if a few tribes follow∣ing gradually the chain of mountains, where the heats are mitigated, at last pass the equator and advance into the South, they become lost in those countries, dismem∣bered from the rest of the species, and never join in the migrations to the North. Such in particular are the Cranes which, Kol∣ben says, are numerous at the Cape of

<P>The East India Crane such as the moderns have observed it, seems not to differ in spe∣cies from the European; it is smaller, its bill rather longer, the skin on the top of its head, red and hard, and extending to the bill; in other respects, it is exactly like the ordinary one, and its plumage is of the same ash-gray. This is the descrip∣tion which Willughby gives of one which he saw alive in St. James's Park.

In all these features, no very precise specific difference can be traced; yet Edwards reckons his <HI>Greater Indian Crane</HI> as quite a distinct bird from that of Wil∣lughby, and what most of all induces him to entertain the opinion is the great dif∣ference of size: and we might agree with him, did not the European Cranes vary widely in that respect <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It seems impossible to draw any certain conclusion from the following passage of Marco Polo.

<P>IT is extremely probable that the Cranes have migrated from the one continent into the other, since they haunt the North∣ern parts of Europe and of Asia. Accord∣ingly, we find in America a White Crane, and one or two kinds of Gray or Brown Cranes. But the White Crane, which in our Continent is only an accidental variety, appears to have formed in the other a per∣manent race, discriminated by strong and decided characters; so that we may con∣ceive it as anciently separated from the common species, and long modified by the influence of climate. It is as tall as our largest Cranes, but of a stronger and thicker make, its bill longer, its head bigger; its neck and legs not so slender: all the plu∣mage is white, except the great quills of the wings, which are black, and the head,
<PB N="297" REF="326"/>
which is brown; the crown is callous and covered with black hairs, straggling and delicate, under which the reddish skin ap∣pears naked; a similar skin covers the cheeks: the tuft of loose feathers in the tail is flat and pendant: the bill is fur∣rowed above, and indented at the edges near the tip; it is brown, and six inches long. Catesby has described this bird from an entire skin given him by an Indian, who told him that these birds frequent, in great numbers, the lower parts of the rivers near the sea in the beginning of spring, and return to the mountains in summer. "This fact, says Catesby, has been since confirmed by a white, who informed me that these Cranes are very noisy, and are seen in the Savannas at the mouth of the Altamaha, and other rivers near St. Augus∣tine in Florida, and also in Carolina; but that they are never found further North."</P>

"They make a remarkable hooping noise: this makes me imagine these to have been the birds, whose clamor Captain Philip Amidas (the first Englishman who ever set soot on North America) so graphically describes, on his landing on the isle of Wokokou, off the coast of North Carolina "When, says he, such a flock of Cranes (the most part white) arose under us with such a cry, redoubled by many echoes, as if an army of men had shouted together." This was in the month of July; which proves, that in those early days this species bred in the then desert parts of the southern pro∣vinces, till driven away by population, as was the case with the common Crane in England; which abounded in our undrained fens, till cultivation forced them entirely to quit our kingdom. <HI>Vol. ii. p.</HI> 442.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Demoiselle of Numidia has all the proportions and the shape of the Crane, only on a smaller scale; its port, its garb, are the same; and the same distribution of colours on the plumage, only the gray is purer, and more pearled. Two white tufts of unwebbed and hairy feathers, falling on each side of the head, form a sort of head-dress; long, soft and silky hairs of the finest black lie on the crown of the head; similar feathers descend from the fore part of the neck, and hang gracefully below it; between the black quills of the wings, appear bending tufts, which are long and pendant. This beautiful bird has received the name of <HI>Demoiselle,</HI> or <HI>Miss,</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="332"/>
on account of its elegant form, its rich garb, and its affected airs: it makes re∣peated reverences; it walks with a sprightly ostentation, and it often leaps and springs from gaiety, as if it meant to dance.</P>
<P>This bent, which, in a certain degree, was remarked in the Crane, is so striking in this Numidian bird, that for more than two thousand years, during which it has been known, authors have constantly de∣nominated it from its mimic gestures. Aris∣totle calls it the actor or comedian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anim. <HI>Lib. viii.</HI> 12.</NOTE>; Pliny, the dancer or vaulter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. x.</HI> 23.</NOTE>; and Plutarch men∣tions its frolics and its address <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De Solert. Animal.</NOTE>. It ap∣pears even to imitate the actions which it beholds: Xenophon, in Athenaeus, seems persuaded of this; "for, says he, the fowl∣ers rub their eyes before it with water which they pour into basons, and then filling these up with bird lime they retire, and the bird copying their example rubs its eyes and feet." Accordingly Athenaeus terms it <HI>The Imitator of Man</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. The Danc∣ing Bird of Numidia seems also to have copied our vanity; it loves to be seen, and to exhibit itself, it seems even to prefer
<PB N="303" REF="333"/>
show to its food, and follows after a per∣son to sollicit as it were another look.</P>
<P>These are the remarks of the academi∣cians on the Numidian Cranes, of which they had several in the <HI>Menagerie</HI> at Ver∣sailles. They compared their steps, their postures and their gestures to <HI>Gipsey dances;</HI> and Aristotle seems to allude to their manner of jumping and vaulting, when he says that <HI>they are caught when they dance opposite one another,</HI></P>
<P>Though this bird was famous among the ancients, it was little known, and seldom seen in Greece or Italy; and confined to its own climate, it enjoyed a sort of fabu∣lous celebrity. Pliny after terming it in one place the <HI>pantomime,</HI> joins it in another passage with <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Lib. x. 49.</NOTE> the Syrens, the Griffins, and the Pegasuses. It was late before the mo∣derns were acquainted with it; they con∣founded it with the <HI>Scops</HI> and <HI>Otus</HI> of the Greeks and <HI>Asio</HI> of the Latins, on account of the odd gestures of that Owl, whose ears were supposed to be represented by the long delicate filaments that hang from each side of the head of the Numidian Dancing Bird.</P>

It dif∣fers from them, however, in several im∣portant characters; it is a native of the hot climates, the Cranes draw their origin from the cold countries; they have a dusky plumage, while the Royal Bird is decorated with the garb of the South, of that burn∣ing zone, where every thing is more bril∣liant, but more fantastic; more animated, but less graceful than in the temperate climates.</P>

They inhabit Africa, especially Gambra, the Gold Coast, Juida, <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom. iv. p.</HI> 355.

"Smith distin∣guishes two kinds of <HI>Crown-Birds;</HI> the first has its head and neck green, its body of a fine purple, its wings and tail red, and its tuft black; it is nearly as large as the great parrots. The other kind (and this is the true Royal Bird) is of the shape of a Heron, and is not less than three feet high; it feeds on fish: its colour is a mixture of blue and black, and the tuft, with which it is crowned, re∣sembles more hogs' bristles than feathers." <HI>Id. p.</HI> 247.</NOTE> Fida, and Cape Verd. Travellers relate, that they are fre∣quently seen by the large rivers; they feed on small fish, and also search in the fields for herbs and seeds; they run very swiftly, spreading their wings, and catching the wind: at other times their pace is slow, with measured steps.</P>
<P>This Royal Bird is gentle and pacific; its defence is its stature, and the rapidity with which it runs or flies. It is less afraid of man than of its other enemies; and seems to approach with chearfulness and confidence. We are assured, that at Cape Verd this bird is half domestic, and that it comes into the court-yards to eat grain with the pintadoes and other fowls. It perches in open air to sleep, like the pea∣cock, whose cry it is said to imitate; and, as it also bears a resemblance by the tuft on its
<PB N="309" REF="340"/>
head, it has been termed by some naturalists the <HI>Sea Peacock</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Clusius. <HI>Exotic. Lib. v.</HI> 2.</NOTE>; others have called it the <HI>Short-tailed Peacock</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Johnston, Barrere, Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and others have as∣serted that it is the same with the <HI>Balearian Crane (Grus Balearica)</HI> of the ancients, but which is not at all proved <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire des Animaux, tom iii. 2.</NOTE>: for Pliny, the only one who has mentioned the Bale∣arian Crane, does not sufficiently charac∣terize it; <HI>both the Woodpecker</HI> (says he) <HI>and the Balearian Crane wear a tuft</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cirros pico martio et Grui Balearicae,</HI> Lib. xi. 37.</NOTE>; but no two things are less similar than the small crest of the Woodpecker, and the crown of the Royal Bird, which besides has several remarkable properties that Pliny might have pitched on. If, however, it was for∣merly brought to Rome from the Balearian islands, where it is no longer found, it would corroborate my position, that ani∣mals are making a gradual progress from the North to the South.</P>
<P>We received this bird from Guinea, and kept it some time in a garden. It pecked the herbs, particularly the core of lettuce and succory. But the food which agrees best with it, is rice, either dry, or slightly
<PB N="310" REF="341"/>
boiled, previously soaked in water, or at least washed and well picked; for it rejects what is of a bad quality, or soiled with dust. It seems also to eat insects, and par∣ticularly earth-worms; and we have seen it among new-turned mould, gathering worms, and catching small insects on the leaves. It is fond of bathing, and ought to have a shallow tray, in which the water should be renewed from time to time. As a regale, we may throw into the tray a few small living fish, which it eats with avidity, but rejects those that are dead. Its cry resembles much that of the Crane, and is clangorous, like the sound of a trumpet or horn: it is repeated at short intervals when the bird wants food, or when it seeks a place of lodgment for the evening <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This bird has still another voice, or rather an inward clucking, like that of a sitting hen, but harsher.</NOTE>. This cry is also the expression of inquietude and weariness; for it tires if left too long by itself. It is glad of a visit, and if the company (after satisfy∣ing their curiosity,) retire without taking farther notice, it follows or walks by their side, and thus makes several turns: and if it is then amused and detained by any novelty, it hastens to rejoin them. When it is in a quiescent posture, it rests on one leg, its large neck is folded back like the lock of a musket, and its body, shrunk and
<PB N="311" REF="342"/>
as it were tottering on its tall limbs, bears horizontally. But if it is alarmed or disturbed, it extends its neck, raises its head, and assumes a stately air, striving by the boldness of its attitude, as it were, to strike awe: its whole body is then almost erect; it advances gravely, and with mea∣sured steps; and the dignity of its demeanor, recommended too by the crown which it wears, justly entitles it to the appellation of <HI>royal.</HI> Its long legs, which aid it much in rising, prove troublesome when it alights; and it therefore spreads its long wings to break the fall; but we were obliged to keep them short, by repeatedly clipping the feathers, to prevent it from flying away, which it often attempted to do. It passed the whole of the winter (1778) at Paris, without appearing to suffer from the rigours of a climate so different from its own. It had chosen for itself a room with a fire to shelter it during the night, and it repaired every evening to the door, sounding for admission.</P>

<P>WE have seen that nature, moving with an uniform pace, connects all her productions by successive gradations. She has by her transitions, filled up the inter∣vals where we would place our divisions, and pause in the wide survey. No void ap∣pears in the vast concatenation of the uni∣verse, and the most distant parts are linked together. Our systems prove inconsistent, therefore, when they attempt to assign limits which no where exist: nay, productions that stand most detached in our methods, are really connected with others by the greatest number of relations. Such are the Ca∣riama, the Secretary, and the Kamichy. The two first are akin to the birds of prey; the last is, on the contrary, related to the gallinaceous tribe; but all the three resem∣ble most, in their instincts and habits, the marsh birds.</P>
<P>The Cariama is a beautiful bird, which frequents fens, where it feeds like the He∣ron,
<PB N="314" REF="345"/>
but is larger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Egregia avis sylvestris cariama ex aquaticorum genere, udosisque locis ob praedam delectatur more ardearum, quas mole corporis longè superat.</HI> Pison. <HI>Hist.

<P>Its neck is high, and its head lofty; under the root of the bill, which is yellowish, there is a tuft-shaped feather; its whole plumage is like that of the Falcon, gray waved with brown; its eyes are brilliant and gold-coloured, and its eye-lids furnished with long black hairs; its legs are yellow∣ish, and of the toes, which are all con∣nected at their origin by a portion of a membrane, the mid-one is longer than the two side ones, of which the inner is the shortest; the nails are short and rounded <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ungues breviusculi, lunati. Ibid.</NOTE>; the hind toe is placed so high, that it will not reach the ground; and the heel is thick and round, like that of the Ostrich. The cry of this bird resembles that of a Turkey-cock; this is loud, and betrays it to the fowlers, who prize it on account of its tender and delicate flesh. If we may credit Piso, most of the birds which haunt

<P>THIS bird, alike conspicuous by its mag∣nitude and by its figure, is not only of a new species, but of a distinct and de∣tatched family; so that it eludes and con∣founds all our artificial classifications. While its long legs seem to shew that it is destined to haunt the fens, its hooked bill declares its affinity to the birds of prey. It has, so to speak, the head of an Eagle joined to the body of a Stork or Crane. To what class then can we refer it? So free and unre∣strained is nature, and so rich and so vast the range of her productions!</P>
<P>The Secretary is as tall as a large Turkey Cock; its colours on the head, the neck, the back, and the coverts of the wings, are of a browner gray than that of the Crane, and become lighter on the fore part of the body; the quills of the wings and of the tail, are stained with black, and the

<PB N="317" REF="349"/>
thighs with black waved with gray; a bundle of long feathers, or rather of stiff black quills, hangs behind the neck; most of these feathers are six inches in length, some are shorter, and a few are gray; all of them are narrow near the base, more fully web∣bed towards the tip, and inserted on the top of the neck. The subject which we describe was three feet six inches high, the tarsus alone near a foot; a little above the knee, there were no feathers; the toes were thick and short armed with hooked nails; the mid-one is almost twice as long as the lateral ones, which are connected by a membrane near half their length, and the hind toe is very strong: the neck is thick, the bill is strong and cleft beyond the eyes; the upper part of the bill is equally and boldly hooked, nearly as in the Eagle, and it is pointed and sharp; the eyes are placed in a sort of naked skin, of an orange colour, which extends beyond the outer corner of the eye, and takes its origin at the root of the bill: there is besides a singu∣lar character, which still more shows the double nature of this bird; it is an eye∣brow formed of one row of black hairs, from six to ten lines in length <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This eye-brow is fifteen or sixteen lines long, the lashes are ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed very close, widening at the base, scooped into channels, concave below, and convex above.</NOTE>: this fea∣ture,
<PB N="318" REF="350"/>
with the tuft of feathers on the top of its neck, its head like that of a bird of prey, its legs like those of a Shore-bird, form altogether an extraordinary ambiguous as∣semblage.</P>
<P>The habits of this bird are as mixed as its structure. Though it has the weapons of the rapacious birds, it is exempt from their ferocity; and it never employs its bill, either for defence or for attack. It seeks safety by flight, and often in the hurry of its escape, it takes leaps of eight or ten feet high. It is gentle and sprightly, and soon grows familiar. At the Cape of Good Hope it has even been domesticated, and is pretty frequent in the houses of the colo∣nists: they find it up the country, a few leagues from the shore; they take it young from the nest, and rear it as much for utility as pleasure, for it destroys Rats, Lizards, Toads and Serpents.</P>
<P>The Viscount de Querhoent has commu∣nicated the following observations on this bird. "When the Secretary," says that ex∣cellent observer, "lights on a serpent, it first tires him out, by striking with its wings; it then lays hold of him by the tail, lifts him up on high, and drops him, which it repeats till the serpent is killed. It spreads its wings, and is thus often seen running
<PB N="319" REF="351"/>
and flying at once. It nestles in bushes a few feet from the ground, and lays two eggs, which are white with rusty spots. When disturbed, it makes a hollow croak∣ing. It is neither dangerous, nor mischie∣vous. Its disposition is gentle; and I have seen two birds of this kind live peaceably in a court-yard amidst poultry. They were fed with flesh, and were greedy after guts and entrails, which they held under their feet while devouring them, as they would have done a serpent. They slept every night together, and the head of each was turned to the tail of its companion."</P>
<P>This bird, though a native of Africa, seems to accommodate itself to an Euro∣pean climate; it is kept in some of the menageries of England and of Holland. Vosmaer who fed one in that of the Prince of Orange, has made some remarks on its manner of living. "It tears and swallows greedily the flesh that is offered to it, and does not refuse fish. When it prepares itself to repose and sleep, it rests with its belly and breast upon the ground: a cry which it rarely utters resembles that of the Eagle: its most usual exercise is to walk with long steps from one side to another, and for a considerable time without halting or slack∣ening

its pace <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This quality has probably conferred on it the name of <HI>Messenger,</HI> as the bundle of feathers on the top of the neck has procured that of <HI>Secretary;</HI> though Vosmaer supposes it derived from the appellation of <HI>sagitary</HI> applied to it, because it often amuses itself by taking a straw in its bill or its foot and darting it repeatedly into the air.</NOTE>: it is of a cheerful, quiet; and timid disposition. If a person ap∣proaches while it runs hither and thither with a supercilious air, it makes a conti∣nual cracking; but after it has recovered from its fright, it appears familiar, and even prying. When the painter was em∣ployed in designing it, the bird drew near him, looked attentively upon his paper, stretched out its neck, and erected the fea∣thers of its head, as if it admired its figure. It often came, with its wings raised and its head projected, to observe curiously what was doing. It thus approached me two or three times, when I was sitting at a table in its hut, in order to describe it. On such occasions, or when it eagerly gathers some scraps, and in general when it is moved by curiosity or desire, it bristles high the long feathers on the back of its head, which commonly fall irregularly on the top of the neck. It was observed to moult in the months of June and February; and Vos∣maer says that, in spite of the closest at∣tention, they could never detect it drinking;
<PB N="321" REF="355"/>
yet its excrements are liquid and white, like those of the Heron. To eat with ease, it squats on its heels, and thus half-reposed, it swallows its food. Its strength seems to lie chiefly in the leg; if a live hen be pre∣sented, it hits her a violent blow with its sole, and knocks her down by a second stroke. It treats rats in the same manner. It watches assiduously before their holes. In general it prefers living to dead animals, and flesh to fish."</P>
<P>It is not long that this singular bird has been known even at the Cape, since, neither Kolben, nor the others who have described the productions of that country, make any mention of it. Sonnerat found it in the Philippines, after having seen it at the Cape. We perceive some differences between his account and the preceding ones, that seem to deserve notice: Sonnerat, for instance, represents the feathers of the crest as rising on the neck at unequal intervals, and the longest as placed the lowest; but neither this order nor proportion occur in the sub∣ject which I inspected, these feathers being collected into an irregular bunch: he adds, that they are bent in the middle next the body, and that their webs are crisped; Vosmaer gives the same statement yet in the one which we have described they were
<PB N="322" REF="356"/>
smooth. Are these differences to be attri∣buted to the objects themselves, or only to the descriptions? But a still greater dis∣agreement occurs in the colour of the plumage, which Vosmaer says is of a blu∣ish lead gray, though we found it to be verg∣ing on brown: he says that the bill is bluish, and we found it to be black above and white below. The subject which we describe is lodged in the cabinet of Dr. Mauduit; the two feathers do not as usual exceed the tail, they only project five inches beyond the wings when closed. But ano∣ther subject, from which our figure was taken, has three long feathers, such as they are described by Vosmaer and Sonnerat. We conceive this to be the character of the male. Sonnerat is mistaken when he reckons the bill of the Secretary as <HI>gallina∣ceous;</HI> which is the more strange, as that naturalist remarks that the bird itself is carnivorous.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the social and familiar dis∣positions of this bird, and its facility in domestication, we are disposed to think that it would be advisable to multiply the spe∣cies, particularly in our colonies, where it might be serviceable in destroying the per∣nicious reptiles and rats. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Falco Serpentarius:</HI> "It is black its head crested, the tip of its tail-quills white, the two middle ones very long."</NOTE></P>

<P>NATURE is not to be studied in the cultivated fields, that smile under the forming hand of industry. We must visit the burning sands of the tropical regions, and the eternal ice of the pole; we must descend from the summits of mountains into the bed of the ocean; and we must. compare remote wilds and deserts: and such magnificent contrasts confer additional sub∣limity on the scenes of the universe. We have formerly painted the arid plains of Arabia Petroea; those naked solitudes, where man has never tasted the coolness of the shade, where the scorched earth, never re∣fresh d by rain or dew, rests torpid and denies all subsistence to every species of being. To this picture of extreme dryness in the Anci∣ent Continent, let us oppose the vast deluged Savannas of the New World. Immense rivers, such as the Amazons, the Plata, the Oronoco, roll their majestic billowy
<PB N="324" REF="359"/>
streams, and swelling over their banks with unchecked licence, they threaten to usurp the whole of the land. Sheets of stagnant water, widely spread, cover their slimy sediment, and these vast marshes exhale dense sickly vapours, which would poison the air, were they not dispersed by the winds, or preci∣pitated in descending torrents. And these meadows, which are alternately dry and wet, where the earth and the water seem to dispute their undecided limits, are inha∣bited only by loathsome animals which multiply in these sewers of nature, where every thing exhibits the image of the mon∣strous depositions of the primaeval sedi∣ment. Enormous serpents trace their wav∣ing furrows on the miry soil; crocodiles, toads, lizards, and a thousand reptiles of hideous forms crawl and welter in the mud; and millions of insects, engendered by warmth and moisture, heave up the slime. And this sordid assemblage of creatures which quick∣ens the ground or darkens the sky, invites numerous flocks of voracious birds, whose confused notes, mingled with the croakings of the reptiles, while they disturb the vast silence of those frightful wilds; inspire hor∣ror, and seem to prohibit the approach of man and of every sentient being.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="360"/>
Amidst the discordant sounds of the screaming birds and croaking reptiles, there is heard at intervals a powerful note, which drowns the rest, and rebellows from the distant shores: it is the cry of the Kamichi, a large black bird, distinguished by its voice and its armour. On each wing, it has two strong spurs, and on its head a pointed horn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The savages of Guiana have named it <HI>Kamichi;</HI> those of Brazil call it <HI>Anhima,</HI> and on the river Amazons <HI>cahuitahu,</HI> in imitation of its powerful cry, which Marcgrave denotes more precisely by <HI>Vyhu-vyhu,</HI> and which he represents as something terrible.</NOTE> three or four inches long, and two or three lines in diameter at the base: this horn, which is inserted in the top of the forehead, rises straight, and ter∣minates in a sharp point bent somewhat forward; near the base it is sheathed like the quill of a feather. We shall afterwards speak of the spurs on the shoulders of certain birds, such as the Jacanas, many species of Plovers, Lapwings, &amp;c. but the Kami∣chi is by far the best armed: for besides the horn which grows out of the head, it has in each pinion two spurs, which project forward when the wing is closed. These spurs are the apophyses of the metacarpal bone, and rise from the anterior part of
<PB N="326" REF="361"/>
these extremities; the upper spur is largest, of a triangular form, two inches long, and nine lines broad at the base, somewhat curved, and terminating in a point; it is also invested with a sheath of the same sub∣stance as the base of the horn. The lower apophysis of the metacarpal bone is only four lines long, of the same breadth at its origin, and similarly sheathed.</P>
<P>With this furniture of offensive arms, which would render it formidable in combat, the Kamichi never attacks other birds, but wages war only against reptiles. It seems even to have a gentle and a feeling dispo∣sition; for the male and female keep con∣stantly together. Love binds their affections by an indissoluble chain: if one happens to die, the survivor can hardly support the loss of its companion; it wanders perpe∣tually moaning, and consumes the wretched remainder of its life near the scenes of tender recollection and of past joys †.</P>
<P>If the affectionate character of this bird forms a contrast to its mode of life, a like opposition obtains in its physical structure <NOTE PLACE="foot">* <HI>Unâ mortuâ, altera a sepulturâ nunquam discedit.</HI> Marc∣grave<HI>...Raro sola incedît; verum junctim, mas &amp; famina.

It subsists on prey, and yet it has the bill of a granivorous bird; and, notwithstanding its spurs and its horn, the head resembles that of a gallinaceous bird; its legs are short, but its wings and tail are very long; the upper mandible projects over the lower, and bends somewhat at the point; the head is clothed with small downy fea∣thers, bristled and crisped, intermixed with black and white; the same curled plumage covers the top of the neck; the lower part is covered with broader, thicker feathers, black at the edge, and gray within; all the mantle is brownish-black, with greenish reflections, and sometimes mixed with white spots; the shoulders are marked with ru∣fous, and that colour extends on the edge of the wings, which are spacious <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alas amplissimas.</HI> Marcgrave.</NOTE>; they reach almost to the end of the tail, which is nine inches long; the bill is two inches long, eight lines broad, and ten thick at its base; the leg joins to a small naked part of the thigh, and is seven inches and a half high, it is covered with a rough and black skin, whose scales are strongly marked on the toes, which are very long; the middle one, including the nail, is five inches, and the nails are half-hooked, scooped out below, the hind one being of a peculiar form,
<PB N="328" REF="363"/>
slender, almost straight, and very long, like that of the Lark. The total length of the bird is three feet: we could not perceive the great difference in point of size noticed by Marcgrave between the male and female. Several of the birds which we examined ap∣peared to be nearly of the magnitude of the Turkey cock.</P>
<P>Willughby justly remarks, that the Ka∣michi is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole species of its genus. Its form is composed of discordant parts, and nature has bestowed extraordinary qualities on it: the horn which projects from its head would alone discriminate it from the whole class of birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Frequens pecora cornuta; raro in aere avem cornua geren∣tem videris.</HI> Pison.</NOTE>. Barrere was mistaken there∣fore in ranging it with the Eagles <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aquila Aquatica Cornuta.</NOTE>; since it has neither their bill, their head, nor their feet.

<P>HAPPINESS is not equally bestowed on all sentient beings. That of man arises from his complacency of mind, and the proper employment of his moral fa∣culties: that of the lower animals results, on the contrary, from their physical qua∣lities, and from the exercise of their cor∣poreal strength. But if nature revolts at the unequal allotment that prevails in hu∣man society, she has herself advanced with
<PB N="330" REF="366"/>
rapid strides in the same path of injustice; and by the imperfection of the organs be∣stowed on some of her creatures, she has con∣demned them to struggle perpetually with misery and want. Neglected children, sent naked into the world, to live in continual penury; their toilsome days are spent in perpetual solicitude, sickened by the restless cravings of a famished appetite: to suffer and to endure, are often their only resources, and this inward pain traces its ghastly im∣pression on their external figure, and ob∣literates all the graces which attend on feli∣city. The Heron presents to us the picture of wretchedness, anxiety, and indigence; and as it can procure its prey only by lying in ambush, it remains whole hours, whole days in the same spot, and so perfectly still, as to discover no signs of life. When ob∣served by a telescope (for it can seldom be approached) it appears benumbed, seated on a stone, its body almost erect, and rest∣ing on a single foot; its neck folded back along its breast and belly, its head and bill sunk between its shoulders, which rise, and much over-top the breast. If it changes its posture to put itself in motion, it as∣sumes another, which is still more con∣strained; it advances into the water to the height of its knee, and, holding its head between its legs, it watches the passing frog
<PB N="331" REF="367"/>
or fish. But as it must wait the spon∣taneous occurrence of its prey, and has only a moment to make the seizure, it is often constrained to suffer long fastings, and sometimes to perish of absolute hunger: for when the waters are bound with ice, it has not the instinct to retire into milder climates. Some naturalists are mistaken in ranking it among the birds of passage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agricola.</NOTE>; for here we see Herons at all seasons, and even during the severest and most continued frosts. Then they are compelled to quit the frozen marshes and rivers, and to repair to the vivulets and perennial springs; and at this time they are most in motion, and make considerable flittings, though only to different parts of the same country. They seem therefore to multiply, as the season grows chiller; and, by dint of patience and sobriety, they endure equally both hunger and cold. But these frigid virtues are com∣monly attended with a disgust for life. When a Heron is caught, it may be kept a fortnight, without shewing the least desire of food, which it even rejects when cram∣med in its throat; its native gloom, che∣rished doubtless by captivity, smothers the strongest instinct implanted in animated beings, that of self-preservation: it wears
<PB N="332" REF="368"/>
out its existence in complete apathy, with∣out venting a complaint, or betraying the least symptom of tender regret <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Experiment made by M. Hebert, to whose excellent observations we owe the principal facts of the natural history of the Heron.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Insensibility, neglect of self-preservation, and some other negative qualities, charac∣terize it better than its positive properties. Pensive and lonely, except in the breeding season, it seems to raste no pleasure, nor even to possess the means of avoiding pain. In the worst weather it remains solitary and exposed, seated on a stake, or on a stone, beside the brink of a rivulet, or on a little eminence in a deluged meadow; while the other birds seek a cover among the foliage: and in the same spots where the Rail shel∣ters itself in the thick herbage, and the Bittern amidst the reeds, the miserable He∣ron stands unprotected from the violence of the tempest, or the piercing severity of the cold. M. Hebert tells us, that he caught one which was half frozen, and entirely incrusted with ice: he avers also, that he has often found the snow or the mud marked with the prints of their feet, but could never follow the traces more than twelve or fifteen paces; a proof of the narrow compass of their quest, and of
<PB N="333" REF="369"/>
their inaction in the most urgent occasions. Their long legs are only stilts, unfit for running; they hold themselves in an erect posture, and perfectly still the greatest part of the day, and this rest serves instead of sleep; for they fly a little in the night <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancients had observed this: Eustathius remarks, at the tenth book of the Iliad, that the Heron fishes at night.</NOTE>; then they are heard screaming in the air at all hours, and in all seasons: their cry consists of a single dry sharp note, which might be compared to that of a Goose, if it were not shorter, and somewhat plaintiff <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Greeks expressed the cry of the Heron, from the time of Homer, by the verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Iliad x.</HI></NOTE>: it is repeated almost incessantly, and pro∣longed by a shriller and more disagreeable tone when the bird struggles with pain and adversity.</P>
<P>To the hardships necessarily attendant on its toilsome life, the Heron adds ills of its own creation, fear and distrust. Every thing disconcerts and alarms it: it flies from a man at a vast distance; and as it is often attacked by an Eagle or Falcon, it endea∣vours to escape their assault by rising into the air, and vanishes with its pursuers in the region of the clouds <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is asserted, that when driven to the last extremity, it psses its head under its bill, and presents its pointed bill to its assailant, which darting with impetuosity, is itself transfixed. Belon. <HI>Nat. des Qiseaux, p.</HI> 190.</NOTE>. It was enough
<PB N="334" REF="370"/>
that nature constituted these too formid∣able enemies, and man might have forborne to whet, against the unhappy Heron <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">The ancients added many other crosses to its lot; the Lark broke its eggs, the Woodpecker killed its young; all were its enemies, but the Crow. <HI>See</HI> Aristotle, <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 18 <HI>et</HI> z.—Pliny, <HI>Lib. x.</HI> 96.</NOTE>, their instincts, and inflame their antipathies: yet the chase of that bird was once the most illustrious in falconry; it was the sport of Princes, who reserved for themselves its lean carcase as honourable game, qualified by the name of <HI>Royal Meat,</HI> and served up for shew at their banquets <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Jo. Bruyerinus, <HI>de re cibariâ,</HI> Lib. xv. 56.—Aldro∣vandus, <HI>tom iii.</HI> 367. "It is commonly said, that the Heron is royal meat, on which the French nobility set great value." Belon. <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux, p.</HI> 190.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence undoubtedly the pains that have been taken to settle Herons in forests, or even in towers, commodious eyries being provided for their nestling. Some profit was drawn from the sale of the young Herons, which were fatted. Belon speaks with raptures of the Heronries which Francis I. caused to be constructed at Fon∣tainebleau, and of the astonishing effect of art which had reduced such savage birds under the dominion of man <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. des Oiseaux, p.</HI> 189.</NOTE>. But the success resulted from their natural dispo∣sitions; they love to breed together, and
<PB N="335" REF="371"/>
for that purpose multitudes assemble in the same district of the forest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is no country where the Herons do not affect certain woods, where they collect together, and make natu∣ral <HI>heronries.</HI> They assemble not only on the great oaks, but also on the pines, as Schwenckfeld remarks of some forests in Silesia.</NOTE> and often on the same tree: and we may suppose that they adopt this measure, to repel the Kite and Vulture by their combined force, or at least, to intimidate them by their num∣bers. It is on the tallest trees that the He∣rons build their nests, and often beside those of the Crows <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, and Belon.</NOTE> which might have led the ancients to imagine that an amity subsisted between these two species, whose habits and instincts are so incongruous. Their nests are spacious, built of sticks, with abundance of dry grass, of rushes <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 2.</NOTE>, and feathers; their eggs are of a greenish blue, which is uniformly pale, nearly as large as those of the Storks, but rather longer, and almost equally thick at both ends. The hatch, we are assured, consists of four or five eggs, which ought to make the species more numerous than it appears to be; many must perish therefore in the rigors of winter, and perhaps, as they are of a gloomy disposition and ill fed, they soon lose the power of procreating.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="372"/>
The ancients, impressed probably with an idea of the miserable life of the Heron, imagined that it suffered pain even in the act of copulation; and that the male at the critical moment discharged blood at the eyes, and screamed with agony <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Ardeolarum . . . pellos in coitu anguntur; mares quidem cum vociferatu sanguinem etiam ex oculis profundunt; necminus aegre pariunt gravidae."</HI> Plin. <HI>Lib. x.</HI> 79. This fable of the torture which the Heron endures in coition has occa∣sioned another, that of its great chastity. Glycas reports that the bird grieves forty days on the prospect of the season of copulation.</NOTE>. Pliny drew from Aristotle this false notion which Theophrastus countenances: it was refuted however as early as the time of Albertus, who assures us that he frequently witnessed the coition of Herons, and that he per∣ceived nothing but the dalliance of love, and the crisis of pleasure. The male first sets one foot on the back of the female, to prepare her for the embrace; then carrying both feet forward he sinks upon her, and holds himself in that posture by slightly flapping his wings <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Johnston.</NOTE>. When she hatches, her mate fishes, and shares with her his cap∣tures; fish are often seen which have dropt from their nests <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Low Britany, the Herons are very frequent, where they nestle in the forests in the tall trees; and as they seed their young with fishes, many of these fall to the ground: several persons have therefore taken occasion to say, that they had been in a country where the fish which dropt from the trees, fatten the swine." Belon, <HI>Nat. des Ois. p.</HI> 189.</NOTE>. It does not appear that
<PB N="337" REF="373"/>
they feed on serpents or other reptiles. We know not why in England it is prohibited to kill this bird <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ardeam in Angliâ occidere capitale esse ferunt.</HI> Mus. Worm. Johnson says the same. [This matter seems to be exagge∣rated. It was formerly reckoned in this country a bird of game, and to preserve the species, the breaking of the eggs was subject to a penalty of twenty shillings. T.]</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have seen that the adult Heron rejects food and dies of hunger: but, if caught young it may be tamed, reared and fattened. We have seen some carried from the nest to the court-yard, where they lived on fish guts, and raw flesh, and associated with the fowls. They are susceptible, not indeed of education, but of certain communicated movements; they have been taught to wreath their neck in different fashions, and to entwine it about their master's arm. But if they were not stimulated, they soon re∣lapsed into their natural melancholy, and remained still and fixed <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"I kept one in my court; it did not seek to escape, it never fled when approached, but remained motionless where it was set: the first days, it presented its bill and even struck with the point, but without hurting. I never saw an animal more patient, more motionless, and more silent." <HI>M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>. The young Herons are at first covered, for a consider∣able
<PB N="338" REF="374"/>
time, with a thick hairy down, chiefly on the head and the neck.</P>
<P>The Heron catches numbers of frogs, and swallows them entire; this fact is ascer∣tained from its excrements, which contain their bones crushed and enveloped in a viscous mucilage of a green colour, formed most probably of the frogs skins reduced to glue. Its excrements, like those of the Aquatic Birds in general, shew an acrid quality on herbs. In times of scarcity, it swallows some small plants, such as the water lentil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>; but its ordinary food is fish. It catches very small ones, and must neces∣sarily have a nice and prompt aim to strike prey that glances with such rapidity. With regard to large fishes, however, Willughby says, with great probability, that it pecks and wounds much more than it draws out of the water. In winter when the frost generally prevails, and it is obliged to re∣sort to the tepid springs, it wades feeling with its foot in the mud, and thus disco∣vers its prey, whether it be a frog or a fish.</P>
<P>By means of its tall legs, the Heron can enter into water more than a foot deep without wetting itself: its toes are extremely long, the middle one being equal to the
<PB N="339" REF="375"/>
Tarsus, and the nail which terminates it is indented within, like a comb <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This comb-like indenting is carved on the dilated and protuberant edge of the inside of the nail, without extend∣ing so far as the point which is sharp and smooth.</NOTE>, and serves to support it, and to cling to the slen∣der roots entangled in the mud. Its bill is jagged with points turned backwards, which secure the fish from slipping out of its hold. Its neck often bends double, and this motion would seem to be per∣formed by a hinge; for it can be bent so, several days after the bird is dead. Wil∣lughby has falsely asserted, that the fifth <HI>vertebra</HI> is reversed; since on examining the skeleton of a Heron, we counted eighteen <HI>vertebrae,</HI> and of these we remarked, that only the five first were somewhat compressed at the sides, and jointed one to another by a projection of each preceding upon the next following, without apophyses, which did not begin to appear till on the sixth <HI>vertebra.</HI> By this singular structure, the part of the neck adjacent to the breast is stiffened, and that contiguous to the head plays in a semicircle on the other, and applies to it in such a manner, that the neck, the head, and the bill, are folded in three pieces, one upon another. The bird suddenly, as if by the action of a spring,
<PB N="340" REF="376"/>
extends this doubled portion, and darts its bill like a javelin By stretching out its neck to the full length, it can reach at least three feet all round: and, when at rest, the neck almost disappears, and is hid be∣tween the shoulders, to which the head seems attached <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Its closed wings project not beyond the tail, which is very short.</P>
<P>To fly, it extends its legs stiff backwards, bends its neck upon its back, and folds it into three parts, including the head and bill; so that from below the head is not visible, and the bill appears to pro∣trude from the breast. It displays larger wings than any bird of prey, and they are concave, and strike the air with an equal and regular motion: and by this uniform flight, the Heron is enabled to soar so high as to be lost in the clouds <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><L>—notasque paludes</L>

<P>Virg. <HI>Georg. i.</HI> 363.</P></NOTE>. It flies oftenest before rain <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>; and from its actions and pos∣tures, the ancients drew conjectures with regard to the state of the air and the changes of the weather. If it remained still and forlorn on the beach, it foreboded wintery cold <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ardea in mediis arenis tristis, hiemem.</HI> Plin. <HI>Lib. lxiii.</HI> 87.</NOTE>; if more than ordinarily restless and clamorous, it promised rain; and if its head
<PB N="341" REF="377"/>
rested on its breast, the direction of the bill signified the quarter from which the wind was to blow <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Aratus and Virgil, Theo∣phrastus and Pliny, establish these indica∣tions, which have been neglected as useless, since means of art more certain have been dicovered.</P>
<P>Few birds soar so high as the Herons, or traverse such extensive tracts in the same climate: and often, says M. Lottinger, some are caught which bear the marks of the places where they haunted. Indeed it must require small force to transport so slender and meager a body, which is shrunk, also flat at the sides, and much more co∣vered with feathers than with flesh. Wil∣lughby imputes the leanness of the Heron, which is excessive, to the perpetual fear and anxiety which torture it, as well as to the want and inactivity of its condition <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"I fired at a Heron, when the weather was excessive cold; the bird was only slightly wounded, and bore the shot to a good distance. A large dog which I had with me, and which was vigorous and bold, hesitated to run in upon this Heron, till he perceived me near him; the bird screamed frightfully, turned on its back, and presented its feet to shield it when one approached nigh; yet when I took it up, though it was full of life and of strength, it did not hart me, nor even attempt any injury. I skinned it for a pre∣paration; it was excessively lean. I had surprized it early in the morning on the brink of a very deep river, where it certainly could not make frequent captures; and several days ago I met with Herons at the same place, as I was seek∣ing for Wild Ducks" <HI>Note extracted from the excellent Memoir of</HI> M.

<P>We shall divide the numerous genus of the Herons into four families: that <HI>of the Heron properly so called;</HI> that of the <HI>Bittern;</HI> that of the <HI>Bihoreau</HI> or Night Heron; and that of the <HI>Crab Heron.</HI> Their common cha∣racters are the length of neck; the straight∣ness of the bill, which is pointed in the upper mandible and indented at the edges near the tip: the length of the wings, which,
<PB N="348" REF="384"/>
when closed, cover the tail; the height of the tarsus, and of the naked part of the thigh; the great length of the toes, of which the middle one has its nail in∣dented, and the singular position of the hind one, which is articulated at the side of the heel near the inner toe; lastly, the naked greenish skin which spreads from the bill to the eyes in them all. Their habits also are nearly the same; for they all haunt the marshes and margins of water; they are patient, slow in their motions, and have a melancholy deportment.</P>
<P>The peculiar features of the family of Herons, in which we include the Egrets, are, the neck excessively long, very slender, clothed below with pendant loose fea∣thers; the body strait, shrunk, and, in most species, set on tall stilts.</P>
<P>The Bitterns have a thicker body, and not so tall legs as the Heron; their neck is shorter, and so well clothed with feathers, as to appear very thick in comparison with that of the Heron.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bihoreaus,</HI> or Night Herons, are not so large as the Bitterns; their neck is shorter, and two or three long feathers inserted in the nape of the neck distin∣guish them from the three other families; their upper mandible is slightly arched.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="385"/>
The Crab Herons, which may be termed the small Herons, form a subordinate fa∣mily, and are nothing but a repetition of the Herons on a smaller scale. None of them equal the Egret, which has only one quarter of the bulk of the Common Heron. The <HI>Blongios,</HI> which exceeds not a Rail, terminates the extensive range of species, of a genus more than any other varied both in size and form. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>Specific character of the Crested Heron of Pennant, <HI>Ardea Major.</HI> "On the back of the head is a black pen∣dulous crest, its body is cinereous; a line on the underside of its neck, and a bar on its breast, black."

<P>AS the species of Herons are numerous, we shall separate those of the Anci∣ent Continent, which amount to seven, from those of the New World, of which we already know ten. The first of the spe∣cies that inhabits our continent, is the Common Heron just described; the second is the White Heron, which received that appellation from Aristotle. It is as large as the Gray Heron, and its legs are even taller; but it wants the tufts, and some naturalists have inaccurately confounded it with the Egret <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>. All its plumage is white, its bill is yellow, and its legs are black. Tur∣ner seems to allege, that the White Heron has been seen to copulate with the gray:
<PB N="351" REF="387"/>
but Belon, with more probability, says only that the two species consort, and live in such friendship as often to rear their young in the same eyry. It appears there∣fore that Aristotle was misinformed, when he asserted that the White Heron constructs its nest with more art than the Gray Heron <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal. <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Brisson gives a description of the White Heron <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Its whole body white; a naked green space between its bill and its eyes; its bill saffron yellowish; its legs black." <HI>Briss.</HI></NOTE>, to which we must add that the naked skin about the eyes is not entirely green, but mixed with yellow on the edges; that the iris <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from Dr. Hermann to M. de Mont∣beillard, dated Strasburg, 22d September 1774.</NOTE> is lemon-colour; and that the naked part of the thighs is greenish.</P>

<P>BELON is the first who gave the name of <HI>Aigrette</HI> (tuft) to this small species of White Heron, and probably because of the long silky feathers on its back; these being employed to decorate the ladies head dress, the warrior's helmet, and the sultan's turban. They were in great request for∣merly in France, when our doughty cham∣pions wore plumes. At present, they serve for a gentler use; they deck the heads of our beauties, and raise their stature: the
<PB N="358" REF="395"/>
flexibility, the softness, and the lightness of these feathers, bestow grace on their motions.</P>
<P>These feathers consist of a single delicate shaft, from which at small intervals, rise pairs of very fine threads, as soft as silk: on each shoulder, there is a tuft of these fine feathers, which extend on the back and beyond the tail; they are of a snowy white, as well as the other feathers, which are coarser and harder. Yet the bird, before it first moult, and perhaps even later, has a mixture of gray or brown in its plumage. One of those killed by M. Hebert in Bur∣gundy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Magny, on the banks of the Tille, 9th May 1778.</NOTE>, had every appearance of being young, and particularly its plumage was stained with dark colours.</P>
<P>The Egret is one of the smallest of the Herons, being commonly not two feet long. When full grown; its bill and legs are black. It prefers the haunts of the sea∣shore; yet it perches and nestles on trees, like the other Herons.</P>

The Great Egret is undoubtedly the most beautiful of these species, and never occurs in Europe. It resembles our Egret in the beautiful white of its plumage, without mixture of any other colour: it is twice as large, and consequently its mag∣nificent attire of silky feathers is the richer and fuller. Like the European Egret, it has its bill and legs black. At Cayenne it breeds in the small islands that rise out of the overflowed Savannas: it does not fre∣quent

<P>WE know not why this Heron, which we received from Cayenne, had the name of <HI>Agami;</HI> unless because of the long feathers in the tail of both birds. These fea∣thers are of a deep blue: the underside of the body is rufous; the neck is of the same colour before, but bluish below, and dark blue above; the head is black, the occiput bluish, from which hang long black fila∣ments.</P>

<P>NIEREMBERG interprets the Mexican name of this bird, <HI>Hoactli</HI> or <HI>Toloactli,</HI> by <HI>Avis Sicca,</HI> dry or lean bird; an appel∣lation which well suits a Heron. The pre∣sent is only one half the bulk of the Com∣mon Heron. Its head is covered with black feathers which extend to the nape in a bunch; the upper side of the wings and the tail are of a gray colour; on the back, there are some black feathers, glossed with green; all the rest of the plumage is white. The female has a different name, <HI>Hoacton;</HI> it is distinguished by some colours of its plumage; it is brown on the body, mixed with several white feathers, and white on the neck, interspersed with brown feathers.</P>
<P>This bird is found in the lake of Mexico; it breeds among the rushes, and has a strong hoarse voice resembling that of the Bittern. The Spaniards term it very improperly a Kingfisher, <HI>Martinete Pescador.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Heron too is very large; it is near four feet from the bill to the nails, a fine crest of black brown, disposed be∣hind, shades its head; its plumage is light brown on the neck, deeper on the back, and still browner on the wings; the shoulders and thighs are of a reddish brown; the stomach is white, and also the great fea∣thers which hang from the foreside of the neck, which are dashed with brown streaks.</P>
<P>These are all the species of Herons known to us; for we do not admit into their number the eighth species described by Brisson from Aldrovandus; because the bird was young, and had still its first garb, as Aldrovandus himself informs us.

It has, be∣sides, one of those defects or natural im∣perfections, which we have remarked in a few species: its bill is wide open two-thirds of its length, both the upper and under mandible parting at that space and meeting again at the point. This bird is found in India, and we received it from Pondi∣cherry;

<P>THOUGH the Bitterns resemble much the Herons, their differences are so marked as easily to discriminate them. Their legs are longer than those of the Herons, their body rather more fleshy, and their neck thicker clothed with feathers, which make it look larger. Notwithstanding the disgraceful implication of its name <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Butor,</HI> in French, signifies also <HI>lubber.</HI></NOTE>, the Bittern is not so stupid as the Heron, though it is more savage: it is hardly ever seen; it inhabits only marshes of a certain limited extent, and abounding with rushes;

it prefers the large pools skirted with wood: there, it leads a lonely peaceful life, covered with reeds, sheltered from the wind and rain, and concealed equally from the hunter whom it dreads, and from its prey, which it watches. It continues whole days in the same spot, and seems to place its safety in concealment and inaction. The He∣ron is more restless, and ventures abroad every evening; at which time the fowlers expect it at the edge of the reedy-fens, where it alights: the Bittern. on the con∣trary, rises in the dusk, and takes a final departure; and thus these two birds, though they inhabit the same tracts, never asso∣ciate together,</P>
<P>It is in autumn only and at sun-set, ac∣cording to Willughby, that the Bittern commences its journey, or changes its abode. In its flight it might be taken for a Heron, did it not utter from time to time a quite different cry, deeper and more re∣sounding, CÕB, CÕB. But this is still less disagreeable, than the frightful voice, to which the bird owes its name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Botaurus,</HI> from <HI>boatus</HI> and <HI>taurus,</HI> denotes the <HI>bellowing of a bull. Willughby.</HI></NOTE>: it is a sort of lowing HI-RHÕND, repeated five or six times in succession in the spring, and which may be heard at the distance of
<PB N="396" REF="438"/>
half a league. This <HI>bumping,</HI> as it is called, exceeds the grunt of the largest bass string. Could we imagine this alarming sound to be the expression of tender love? It is indeed only the call of a rude and wild bird, stimulated by lust, not mollified by attachment: and as soon as his appetite is satisfied, he deserts or rejects the female, though she plies him with her assiduous caresses <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to Salerne, such is the indolence of the male, that the female alone takes all the trouble of court∣ship, and of the rearing of the young, "It is she that solicits and invites him to love by the frequent visits which she pays him, and by the abundance of food which she brings." But all these particulars, taken out of an old moral discourse, <HI>(Discours de M. de la Chambre, sur l' amitié),</HI> are probably romance.</NOTE>; nor are her solicitations suffi∣cient to incite him to repeat the almost momentary embrace. Accordingly the cock and hen live separate, "I have often, says M. Hebert, put up two of these birds at the same time, and I constantly perceived that they sprang more than two hundred paces from one another, and alighted at an equal distance." But the moments of fruition must return perhaps after long intervals, if it be true that the Bittern is in season during the whole time that he <HI>bumps</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>; for the lowing begins in Febru∣ary
<PB N="397" REF="439"/>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It is certainly the cry of the Bittern which Aristotle considers in his problems <HI>(Sect ii.</HI> 35), where he speaks of a bellowing like that of a bull, which is heard in the spring from the heart of the marshes, and of which he seeks a phy∣sical explanation in the winds imprisoned under the water and bursting from their caverns.</NOTE>, and is yet heard in the harvest. The people of the country say, that to make this noise the Bittern plunges its bill in the mud <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><P>This notion is well expressed by a charming poet:—</P>
<Q><L>—"So that scarce</L>

<P>THOMSON.</P></NOTE>: the first note resembles indeed a strong inspiration, and the second an expi∣ration rebellowed in a cavity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus has inquired into the structure of the <HI>tra∣chea-arteria</HI> with a reference to the production of this sound; many strong voiced Aquatic birds, such as the Swan, have a double <HI>larynx;</HI> the Bittern, on the contrary, has none, but the trachea, where it forks, forms two inflated sacs, of which the rings of the trachea cover only one side; the other is covered with a thin skin, expansible, and elastic; it is from these inflated sacs that the imprisoned air escapes with violence in bellowing.</NOTE>. But it would be difficult to ascertain the truth of this assertion; since the bird lurks always so close as to escape sight, and the fowlers cannot reach the spots where it springs, without wading through the reeds in water often as high as the knee.</P>
<P>All these precautions for concealment and protection are fortified by caution and
<PB N="398" REF="440"/>
artifice. The Bittern sits with its head erect, which being more than two feet high, it easily sees over the reeds, without being perceived by the sportsman. It does not change its seat until the approach of night in the autumnal season, and passes the rest of its life in such inactivity, that Aristotle gives it the epithet <HI>lazy</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Hist. An. l. ix. c. 18.</NOTE>. Its whole motion consists in seizing a frog, or small fish which throws itself in the way of the indolent catcher.</P>
<P>The appellation of stary, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>stel∣laris,</HI> given by the ancients to the Bittern, is derived▪ according to Scaliger, from its evening flight, when it soars aloft, and seems to lose itself in the starry-vault: others assert that the name refers to the spots scattered on its plumage. But these are disposed more like dashes than stars: the whole body is covered with blackish speckles: they are strewed transversely on the back upon a fulvous brown ground, and run longitudinally on a whitish ground upon the foreside of the neck, upon the breast and the belly: the bill has the same shape as in the Heron; both it and the legs are greenish, its opening is very wide, and the cleft extends beyond the eyes, so that they
<PB N="399" REF="441"/>
may be said to be situated upon the upper mandible: the hole of the ear is large; the tongue short and sharp, and does not reach half the bill; but the throat may be opened so wide as to admit the fist <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>: its long nails clasp the reeds, and support it upon their floating wrecks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The great length of the nails, particularly of the hind one, is remarkable; Aldrovandus says, that in his time it was used as a tooth-pick.</NOTE>: it catches many frogs; and in autumn, it goes to the woods in pursuit of mice, which it seizes with great dexterity and swallows entire <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>: and in that season, it grows very fat <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. When caught it shews much rancour <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>, and strikes chiefly at the eyes <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. Its flesh must be of a bad quality, though it was formerly eaten, when that of the Heron was held in esti∣mation <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Bittern lays four or five greenish light-brown eggs <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant says five or six. T.</NOTE>; and makes her nest amidst the reeds, or a bunch of rushes. Belon surely confounded it with the Heron, when he asserted, that it breeds on the tops
<PB N="400" REF="442"/>
of trees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner was not better acquainted with its nest, when he said that it layed twelve eggs.</NOTE>. That naturalist seems also to mistake it for the <HI>Onocrotalus</HI> of Pliny, though the Roman delineates it by discri∣minating characters. There is another pas∣sage of Pliny, which, according to Belon, refers to the Bittern: "In the district of Arles, there is a bird which imitates the lowing of oxen, and is called the <HI>Bull (Taurus)</HI> though it is little <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. x.</HI> 57.</NOTE>." In that case the epithet <HI>little</HI> is applied to the Bittern only by way of contrast to the appellation, <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P>The Bittern occurs wherever there are marshes of sufficient extent: it is known in most of the French provinces; it is not uncommon in England <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.</NOTE>; it is frequent in Switzerland <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>, and in Austria <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elench. Austr.</HI> 348.</NOTE>; it is seen also in Silesia <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>, Denmark <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Brunnich, <HI>Ornithol. Boreal.</HI></NOTE>, and in Sweden <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>. The most northern parts of America have also their species of Bit∣tern; and other species occur in the south∣ern regions. It appears however, that our Bittern is not so hardy as the Heron, and cannot support our winters, but removes
<PB N="401" REF="443"/>
when the cold becomes excessive. Intel∣ligent sportsmen assure us, that they never found it by the sides of rivulets or near springs in the inclement seasons: and Wil∣lughby seems to regard its lofty flight after sun-set in autumn, as its departure to warmer climates.</P>
<P>No observer has given us fuller informa∣tion on the subject of this bird than M. Baillon; and I shall here give an extract of the account which he obligingly sent to me.</P>
<P><Q>“”The Bitterns are found almost every season of the year at Montreuil-sur-Mer, and on the coasts of Picardy, though they are migratory.</Q> They are seen in great numbers in the month of December, and sometimes dozens lurk in a single tuft of reeds.</P>
<P><Q>“”Few birds make so cool a defence; it never attacks, but if once assailed, it fights with intrepidity and temper.</Q> If darted upon by a bird of prey, it does not fly; it stands erect and receives the shock on the point of its bill, which is very sharp; and its wounded antagonist retreats screaming. Old Buzzards never attack the Bittern, and the Common Falcons never seize it, but by rushing upon it behind, while it is on
<PB N="402" REF="444"/>
the wing. It even makes resistance when wounded by the sportsman; and instead of retiring, it waits his onset, and gives such vigorous pushes with its bill as to pierce the leg through the boots; and many have in this way been sorely wounded. It must be killed by blows, for it would contend till death.</P>
<P><Q>“”Sometimes, though seldom, the Bittern turns on its back like the rapacious birds, and fights both with its bill and its claws, which are very long.</Q> It throws itself into that posture, when surprized by a dog.</P>
<P>The patience of this bird is equal to its courage; it remains whole hours, without stirring, in the water concealed by the rushes: it watches the eels and frogs; and except in the love season, when it takes some excercise, it is as indolent and melancholy as the Stork. At other times, it cannot be discovered but by dogs. During the months of February and March, the males utter, in the morning and evening, a cry, which may be compared to the explosion of a large musket. The females run to the sound, sometimes a dozen round one male; for the Bitterns are, like the Ducks, poly∣gamous: the males strut among their mates, and drive off their rivals. They
<PB N="403" REF="445"/>
make their nests almost close on the water amidst rushes, in the month of April: the incubation lasts twenty-four or twenty-five days: the young ones are hatched naked, and of an unsightly figure, for they seem to be all neck and legs. They do not venture abroad until twenty days after their birth. The parents feed them first with leeches, lizards, and frogs' spawn, and afterwards with small eels. Their fea∣thers are rufous at first, as in the adults; their bill and legs rather white than green. The Buzzards, which plunder the nests of most of the Marsh-birds, seldom touch those of the Bittern. The parents main∣tain a constant guard and defence. Chil∣dren dare not approach, for they should risk the loss of their eyes."</P>
<P><Q>“”It is easy to distinguish the males by their colour and their size, they being more beautiful and larger than the females, and their plumage having more the rufous tint; the feathers too on the breast and neck are longer.</Q></P>
<P>"The flesh of this bird, particularly that of the wings and breast, is tolerable food, provided that the skin be removed, whose capillary vessels are filled with an acrid oil, that spreads through the substance in

This bird is found also over the whole extent of North America: in Hudson's Bay it appears in May, and takes up its abode among the swamps and willows; it there lays two eggs; it is exceeding lazy, and when disturbed it flies only to a short distance.—The flesh of the Bittern tastes somewhat like hare, and is not unpleasant.</NOTE></P>

<P>GESNER is the first who has mentioned this bird, which appears to form the shade between the Herons and the Bit∣terns.

The neck is rufous, with spots of white and black; the back and the wings are brown, and the belly is rofous; its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is at least three feet and an half, and to the nails, more than four feet; the bill is eight inches, and is yellow, as well as the legs. Aldro∣vandus's figure represents a crest, which is

And perhaps, as Salerne conjectures, it may be the same with the small Bittern, which appears sometimes in Sologne, and is known under the name of <HI>Quoimeau.</HI> Marsigli assigns the Danube also as the haunt of this species, which is the third of Aldrovandus; and the au∣thors of the Italian Ornithology say, that it is a native of the country of Bologna <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sgarza stellare rossiccia.</HI> Gerini, <HI>tom. iv. p.</HI> 50.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS species is rather larger than the preceding, being two feet and a half long; the great quills of the wings and the tail are black; all the upper surface is handsomely inlaid with very fine small lines of rufous, yellowish and brown, which wave transversely, and form demi-festoons; the upper side of the neck and the head are of a bright rufous, intersected also with small brown lines; the forepart of the neck and of the body is white, marked lightly with some brown streaks.</P>
<P>These two species were sent to us by M. De la Borde, King's physician at Cay∣enne. They lurk in the gullies excavated by the rills which flow into the Savannas; they haunt also the sides of rivers. In droughts, they lie close in the thick herb∣age; they are flushed at a great distance, and never two appear together. If we wound one, we must be cautious in ap∣proaching it; for it acts on the defensive,

<P>M. De la Borde saw a tame, or rather, a captive <HI>Onoré</HI> in a house. It was conti∣nually on the watch for rats, and it caught them more dextrously than a cat.

<P>MOST of the naturalists have given this bird the appellation of <HI>Nycti∣corax,</HI> or <HI>Night-raven,</HI> on account of a strange sort of croaking, or rather a fright∣ful and dismal rattling, which it makes during the night <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vesperé &amp; noctu absonâ voce molestat.</HI> Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. And this is the only resemblance which it bears to the Raven; for in other respects, it is analogous to the Heron: the only difference is, that its neck is shorter and better feathered; its head larger, and its bill thicker: it is also smaller, not exceeding twenty inches in length. Its plumage is black, with a green gloss on the head and the nape of the neck; dull green on the back; pearl∣gray on the wings and the tail, and white on the rest of the body. The male has
<PB N="420" REF="465"/>
on the nape of the neck some feathers; commonly three in number, exceedingly delicate, of a snowy white <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and about five inches long; and of all crest-plumes, these are the most beautiful and the most precious <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"They are sold at a high price, says Schwenckfeld, and our young nobility are fond of wearing the plumes in their hat."</NOTE>; they drop in the spring, and return only once a-year. The female wants this ornament, and differs considerably from the male; so that some naturalists have mistaken it. Brisson has made it his ninth species of Heron. It has all the upper surface of a rusty-ash colour; dashes of the same tint on the neck; and the un∣derside of the body is light gray.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bihoreau</HI> breeds in rocks, according to Belon, who thence derives its ancient French name, <HI>Roupeau:</HI> but Schwenckfeld and Willughby agree, that it builds its nest on alders near marshes. These oppo∣site accounts cannot be reconciled without supposing, that these birds vary their habits according to circumstances; that in the plains of Silesia and Holland they settle on the aquatic trees, and that on the coasts of Britany, where Belon saw them, they

<P>The <HI>Bihoreau</HI> seems to be a bird of pas∣sage. Belon saw one exposed in the market, in the month of March; Schwenckfeld asserts, that it retires from Silesia in the beginning of autumn, and returns with the Storks in the spring. It frequents equally the sea-shores, or the rivers and inland marshes. It is found in France at Sologne; in Tuscany on the lakes Fucecchio and Bi∣entine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Italian Ornithology, <HI>tom. iv. p.</HI> 49.</NOTE>; but the species is every where more rare than that of the Heron: it is also less dispersed, and is not spread to Sweden <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">We judge so, because it is not mentioned in the <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As its legs are not so tall and its neck shorter than the Heron, it lives partly on the water and partly on the land; and subsists as much upon crickets and slugs as upon frogs and fish.

<P>FOR the knowledge of this bird we are indebted to Adanson, who found it at Senegal. It is rather larger than the Night Heron. It owes its name to the dun or umbre cast of its plumage. It ought to be regarded as an anomalous species in the tribe of Marsh-birds; for it belongs not exactly to any of them. It might be classed with the Herons, if its bill had not been of an entirely different form, and even peculiar to itself; being very broad and thick near the head, growing flatter at the sides as it extends; the ridge of the upper mandible is prominent the whole length, and seems to be detatched by two grooves that run on each side, which Brisson describes, by saying that the bill appears composed of several jointed pieces: the ridge is reflected at the tip of the bill, and terminates in a curved point; the whole
<PB N="424" REF="469"/>
length of the bill is three inches and three lines. The leg is four inches and a half, and the naked part of the thigh two inches. These measures were taken from one of these birds deposited in the king's cabinet. Brisson seems to make them larger. The toes are invested near the root by the be∣ginning of a membrane, which spreads more between the outer and middle toe: the hind toe is not joined as in the Herons to the side of the heel, but to the heel itself.</P>

Its length from the bill to the nails is two feet eight inches; the naked part of the thigh, reckon∣ing from the leg, is seven inches; the bill is four, and is straight almost its whole length, and slightly curved near the point; and this is the only circumstance in which it resembles the Curlews. On the nail of the great toe, there is a protuberant edge on the inside, which represents the indented comb of the Heron. The plumage is a beautiful brown, which becomes reddish and coppery on the great quills of the wing and of the tail. Each feather of the neck has a white dash on its middle.

<P>THE <HI>Savacou</HI> is a native of Guiana and Brazil. It has nearly the bulk and proportions of the <HI>Bihoreau;</HI> and, by its general structure and its mode of living, it would approach the Heron-tribe, did not its broad and remarkable flat bill sepa∣rate it widely, and discriminate it even from all the other Marsh-birds. It has been called <HI>Spoon-bill,</HI> from the resemblance to two spoons applied to each other at the concave sides. On the convexity of the upper mandible, there are two deep grooves, which are sent off from the nostrils and produced, so that the middle space makes a high ridge terminated by a small hooked point. The lower mandible, upon which the upper is fitted, may be said to be the
<PB REF="472"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE CRESTED BOAT-BILL.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="427" REF="473"/>
frame, whereon the skin prolonged from the throat is extended. Both mandibles are sharp at the edges, and consist of a solid and very hard horn. The bill is four inches from the corners to its point, and its greatest breadth twenty lines.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding its formidable weapon, the Savacou seems to have a mild disposi∣tion, and to lead a calm peaceful life, if we may judge from the names applied by nomenclators: the appellation <HI>Cancrofagus</HI> given by Barrere implies that it subsists on crabs. But on the contrary, it removes from the sea shore, and haunts the deluged Savan∣nas, or the sides of rivers where the tide never ascends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations made at Cayenne by M. Sonini de Man∣noncour.</NOTE>. There, perched on the aquatic trees, it watches the fish as they pass by it, and plunges after them under the water, and again emerges with its prey <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoirs communicated by M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne.</NOTE>.

bill, and give it a wild aspect. If it is caught, it cracks its bill; and when it is irritated, or thrown into agitation, it erects the long feathers on the top of its head.</P>
<P>Barrere reckons three species of the Sava∣cou, which Brisson reduces to two, and which may probably be comprehended under one. In fact, the gray and the brown have no remarkable difference, except that the latter is furnished with a long tuft, which may be the character of the male. The other, which we conceive to be the female, has a trace of the same character in the feathers which hang from the back of the head. The difference between the colours of their plumage may be attributed to age or sex; especially as the <HI>Variegated Savacou</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brought from Cayenne by M. Sonini.</NOTE> forms the uniting shade. Their forms and proportions, too, are precisely the same; and we are the more convinced that they constitute but a single species, because nature, though she sports with variety in the general plan of her works, leaves some solitary and insulated produc∣tions of peculiar structure on the confines of the grand divisions. The Avoset, the
<PB N="429" REF="475"/>
Spoonbill, the Flamingo, &amp;c. are examples of this remark.</P>
<P>The Brown and Crested Savacou, which we take to be the male, has more of the refous-gray than of the bluish-gray, on its mantle. The feathers of the nape are black, and form a bunch of eight inches long, falling on the back: these feathers are float∣ing, and some of them eight lines broad.</P>
<P>The Gray Savacou, which appears to be the female, has the whole of its mantle of a bluish light gray, with a small black zone on the top of the back; the under∣side of the body is black, mixed with rufous; the forepart of the neck and the front, are white; the head-dress falls back into a point, and is of a bluish black.</P>
<P>In both, the throat is naked; the skin which covers it, seems capable of a consi∣derable dilatation: and this is probably what Barre means by the expression <HI>ingluvie extuberante.</HI> This skin, according to Marc∣grave, is yellowish, as well as the legs; the toes are slender, and the <HI>phalanges</HI> long. We may also remark, that the hind-toe is arti∣culated with the side of the heel, near the outer toe, as in the Herons. The tail is short, and does not project beyond the wing. The total length of the bird is
<PB N="430" REF="476"/>
about twenty inches. Our measures were taken from larger specimens than that de∣scribed by Brisson, which was probably a young one. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus erects the Boat-bill into a distinct genus, under the name of <HI>Cancroma,</HI> which is divided into two species, the <HI>Cochlearia</HI> and the <HI>Cancrophaga,</HI> the formes having a tawny belly, and the latter a whitish.

<P>THOUGH the Spoon-bill is distin∣guished by a singular figure, nomen∣clators have, under improper and foreign appellations, confounded it with quite different birds. It is neither a <HI>White-Heron,</HI> nor a <HI>Pelican,</HI> as some have repre∣sented it: and the name <HI>Spatula</HI> or <HI>Spoon-bill,</HI> adopted in most languages, seems to suit it the best. The bill is flat; and near its extremity, it spreads like a shovel, and terminates in two rounded plates, thrice as broad as the body of the bill itself. On account of this conformation, Klein has denominated the bird <HI>Anomaloroster,</HI> or <HI>Anomalous-bill;</HI> the substance of this bill is as anomalous as its shape, being flexible like leather, and therefore by no means fitted for the office which Pliny and Cicero
<PB N="432" REF="479"/>
assign to it, applying inaccurately to the Spoon-bill what Aristotle had justly asserted of the Pelican; viz. that it darts at the Diving birds, and bites them on the head until they resign their prey <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist.

Such confusion and such false erudition merit not an exami∣nation; and instead of wasting our time in obscure investigation, we shall proceed directly to survey the simple beauties of nature.</P>
<P>The Spoon-bill is entirely white; as large as a Heron; its legs not so tall, its neck not so long, but clothed with small narrow seathers; those below the head
<PB N="433" REF="480"/>
are long and narrow, and form a tuft which falls behind; the throat is covered, and the eyes encircled, with a naked skin; the legs and the bare part of the thighs, are covered with a black, hard, and cal∣lous skin; a portion of membrane connects the toes near their junction, and, by its production, fringes and borders them to their extremity; black cross waves mark the yellowish ground of the bill, whose extremity is yellow, mixed sometimes with red; a black border, which runs contiguous to a channel, forms a sort of ledge quite round the bill, and within, there is a long groove under the upper mandible; a small point bent downwards, terminates the ex∣tremity of the spoon, whose greatest breadth is twenty-three lines, and which is fur∣rowed internally with small <HI>striae,</HI> that make the surface rougher on the inside than on the outside: near the head, the upper mandible is so broad and thick, as to occupy apparently the whole front: the two mandibles near their origin are equally beset within near the edges, with small tubercles, or furrowed prominences, which serve to bruise shells, or hold a slip∣pery prey; for it appears that this bird feeds equally on fish, on crustaceous animals, on aquatic insects, and on worms.</P>

carmine; the head and the throat are naked. These beautiful colours are found only in the adult; for there are some which have much less red, and are even almost entirely white, the head not bare, and the quills of the wing partly brown; which are the ves∣tiges of its first garb. Barrere affirms, that there is the same progress of colour in the American Spoon-bills as in many other birds, the Red Curlews, for instance, and the Flamingos, which during the two first years are almost entirely gray or white, and do not become red till the third year. It hence follows that the Rose-coloured Bird of Brazil, or the <HI>Ajaia</HI> of Marcgrave, de∣scribed in its early stage, with wings of pale carnation; and the Crimson Spoon∣bill of New Spain, or the <HI>Tlauhquechul</HI> of Fernandez, described in its adult state, are really the same. Marcgrave says, that num∣bers of them are seen on the river St. Francis or Seregippa, and that the flesh is pretty good.

But the species is no where numerous: at Cayenne, for instance, there are perhaps six times more Curlews than Spoon-bills, and their greatest flocks never exceed eight or nine at most, commonly only two or three, and often these are accompanied by Flamingoes. In the morning and evening, the Spoon-bills are seen on the Sea-shore, or sitting on trunks that float near the beach; but about the middle of the day in the sultriest wea∣ther they enter the creeks, and perch very high on the aquatic trees. Yet they are
<PB N="440" REF="487"/>
not very wild; for at sea they pass very near the canoes, and on land they suffer a person to get within gun-shot of them, whether they be alighted or on the wing. Their beautiful plumage is often soiled by the mud, in which they wade deep in quest of prey. M. De la Borde, who made these observations on their oeconomy, confirms M. Barrere's account of their colour, and assures us that the Spoon-bills of Guiana do not assume, until about their third year, that beautiful red tint, and that the young ones are almost entirely white.</P>
<P>M. Baillon, to whom we are indebted for many good observations, admits two spe∣cies of Spoon-bills, and informs me, by letter, that both these appear on the coasts of Picardy, in the months of November and April, but that neither of them remains: they stop a day or two near the sea, and the adjacent marshes; they are few in number, and seem extremely shy.</P>
<P>The first is the Common Spoon-bill, which is of a very bright white and has no crest: the second species is crested, and smaller than the other. M. Baillon thinks that these differences, with some varieties in the colours of the bill and plumage, are sufficient to constitute two distinct and independent species.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="488"/>
He is also persuaded, that all the Spoon∣bills are hatched gray like the Egrets, which they resemble in the shape of their body, in their manner of flying, and in their other habits: he regards those of St. Domingo as forming a third species. But it appears to us from the reasons already advanced, that these are only three varieties of the same species, since they have all the same instincts and habits.</P>
<P>M. Baillon observed in five Spoon-bills, which he was at the pains to dissect, that all of them had their stomach filled with shrimps, small fish, and water insects; and, as their tongue is almost nothing, and their bill neither sharp nor indented, it would seem that they cannot catch eels, or any fish that make resistance, and that they live on very small animals, which obliges them to search continually for their food.</P>
<P>It is probable that these birds in certain circumstances make the same clattering with their bill as the Storks; for M. Baillon, having wounded one, observed that it made that noise, which was produced by the quick and successive motion of the mandi∣bles, though the bill was so weak that it could hardly squeeze the finger. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Roseate or Scarlet Spoon-bill <HI>Platalea-Ajai:</HI> "Its body is blood coloured."</NOTE></P>

<P>OF all the birds of passage, the Woodcock is that on which sportsmen set the most value; both on account of the excel∣lence of its flesh, and the facility with which it is caught.

distant countries, but only shifts from the higher to the lower regions of the atmos∣phere <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"The Woodcock is a bird which resides in summer among high mountains, the Alps, the Pyrenees, Switzer∣land, and Auvergne, where we have often seen it in that season. But in autumn it descends into the plains and coppices; and since Greece abounds with such lofty moun∣tains, we need not wonder that Aristotle should not have said that it is migratory. In fact the Woodcock differs from the other birds which entirely leave a country, for it only shifts its abode, spending the summer in the uplands, and the winter in the valleys, where it haunts the perennial springs and wet places, while the summits of the mountains are frozen, and extracts the worms out of the ground with its long bill; and for this purpose it flies in the morning and evening, passes the day among the brakes, and comes abroad at night." <HI>Belou.</HI></NOTE>. It quits the summits of the An∣des and Pyrenees on the first fall of snow, which happens on these elevations about the beginning of October; it settles below on the gentle acclivities, or advances into the sunny vales.</P>
<P>The Woodcocks arrive in the night, and sometimes during the day, in cloudy weather <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, always one by one, or two together, but never in flocks. They alight among large hedge-rows, copses, and tall clumps, and prefer those woods which abound with loose mould and fallen leaves. They lie concealed the whole day, and lurk so close that it requires-a dog to put them
<PB N="444" REF="492"/>
up, and they often spring at the sportsman's feet. They leave their dark leafy retreats on the approach of evening, and spread among the glades, keeping always the little paths. They seek the soft and wet pasturage by the skirts of the wood, and the small meres, where they wash their bill and feet, which are daubed with earth in searching for their food. They have all the same oeconomy; and we might say in general, that the Woodcocks are birds void of character, and that the habits of the individual result entirely from those of the species.</P>
<P>The Woodcock makes a noisy flapping with its wings when it rises. In tall groves it shoots pretty straight along, but in copses it is often obliged to deflect its course, and dives behind the bushes to conceal itself from the fowler <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Its flight, though rapid, is neither high, nor long supported. It stops with such promptness, as to fall apparently like a dead weight. A few moments after it drops, it runs swiftly; but soon stops, raises its head, and casts a glance all round, before it ventures to lurk in the herbage. Pliny justly com∣pares the Woodcock to the Partridge in
<PB N="445" REF="493"/>
regard to the celerity with which it runs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rusticula &amp; perdices currunt.</HI> Plin.</NOTE> for it conceals itself in the same way, and before the sportsman reaches the spot where he perceives it to alight, he finds that it has already tripped to a great distance.</P>
<P>It appears that this bird, though it has large eyes, does not see well but in twilight, and cannot support a strong light. This seems to be evinced by its manner of life, and by its motions, which are never so agile as in the dawn, or at the close of the day. And so strong is this propen∣sity to action at the rise or descent of the sun, that Woodcocks kept in a room have been observed to flutter regularly every morning and evening; while during the day or the night, they only tripped on the floor, without attempting to fly. And pro∣bably the wild Woodcocks remain still in dark nights; but in moon-light they come abroad in quest of food. Hence the sports∣men call the full moon of November, <HI>the Woodcock's moon (lune des becasses)</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In England, it is usually termed <HI>the hunter's moon.</HI> T.</NOTE>, because they are then caught in the greatest num∣bers. The snares are laid in the evening or the night; and these are the <HI>pantenne,</HI> the
<PB N="446" REF="494"/>
spring or the noose: the <HI>pantenne</HI> or <HI>pen∣tiere</HI> is a net spread between two large trees, in the opening or skirt of a wood, where the birds are observed to pass in their even∣ing-flight. They may also be shot in the meres, or on the brooks and fords at sun∣set: the fowler fits in a close arbour near the spot which the Woodcocks frequent; and a little after the close of day, especially when the mild south or south-west winds blow, they generally arrive, one or two together, and alight on the water, where they may be fired at, with almost certain success. Yet this sport is less profitable and more precarious than that practised by springs set in their paths. These are switches of hazel, or other flexible and elastic wood, driven into the ground, and tied down to a trap that encircles a noose of hair or pack-thread: the rest of the path is inclosed with boughs; or if the spring be planted on pasture-ground, brooms or junipers are stuck in rows, so as to leave only a small passage. The bird advances in the track, and being averse to leap or fly, it brushes on the trap, which starting, it is seized in the noose and lifted into the air by the recoil of the switch. The Woodcock thus suspended struggles much, and the sportsman must make more
<PB N="447" REF="495"/>
than one progress among his snares in the evening, and still more towards the end of the night, else the fox, a more diligent hunter, informed by the flapping of their wings, will pay a visit, and carry them off one after another, and, without taking time to eat them, will conceal them in different places, to be devoured at leisure. The haunts of this bird may be discovered by its excrements, which are large, white, and inodorous. To invite it into pastures where there are no paths, furrows are traced, which it follows in search of the worms that are turned up, and it is entangled in the gins or hair-nooses placed in the line.</P>
<P>But are these not too many snares for a bird which can shun none? The Wood∣cock is naturally dull and stupid; it is <HI>a very sottish creature (moult sotte béte)</HI> says Belon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"With us, says Willughby, this bird is notorious for its stupidity, insomuch as to have become proverbial." And probably for the same reason, the Woodcock, as we are told by Dr. Shaw, is called in Barbary, <HI>Hammar el Hadjel,</HI> or the Ass of the Partridges.</NOTE>. It must indeed be such, if it can be caught in the way which he relates and which he calls a <HI>waggery (folatrerie).</HI> A man covered with a hood of the colour of dry leaves, walks bent on two short crutches, and approaching gently, he stops when the Wood∣cock
<PB N="448" REF="496"/>
stops, and resumes his motion when it does, until he sees it fixed with its head low; he now strikes his two sticks against each other, and <HI>the bird so amuses</HI> and <HI>befools itself,</HI> says our old naturalist, that the per∣son can get so near it as to slip a noose over its neck. Might not this stupidity and this facility of disposition induce the ancients to assert that the Woodcock had a wonderful attachment to man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 26.</NOTE>? On that supposition, its affections are very misplaced, and bestowed on its greatest enemy. In fact, it ranges through the woods as far as our farm-hedges and country-houses: so much Aristotle remarked <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"It is caught by the garden-hedges." <HI>Id. Ibid.</HI> "It is also seen near inhabited places, particularly along hedges." <HI>Olina.</HI></NOTE>. But Albertus was mistaken when he said, that it seeks the cultivated spots and the gardens, to gather seeds; since neither the Woodcock, nor any bird of that kind, will touch fruit or grain <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Lib. ix.</HI> Aristot.</NOTE>. The straight shape of its bill, which is very long and weak at the point, would alone preclude that sort of food; and in fact, it lives wholly on worms <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld. "As soon as they enter the woods, they run on the heaps of dry leaves, which they turn over and scatter to find the worms that lurk underneath. The Woodcocks have this habit in common with the Lapwings and the Plovers, which take the worms by the same means under the green herbage. But I have remarked that these latter birds, of which I have raised several in my garden, struck the ground with their foot about the holes where the worms were lodged, probably to make them come out by this commotion, and seized them often before they were entirely emerged." <HI>Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Mon∣trcuil-sun-mer.</HI></NOTE>.
<PB N="449" REF="497"/>
It digs in the soft soil near bogs and springs, in loose pasture-mould, and in the wet meadows that skirt the woods: it does not scrape the earth with its feet; it only turns over the leaves with its bill, and tosses them briskly from right to left. It seems to discover its food by the smell <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot"><P>Here is the way in which M. Bowles saw Woodcocks seed at St. Ildephonso, where the Infant Don Louis had a volery filled with all sorts of birds.</P>
<P>"There was, says he, a fountain which flowed perpe∣tually to keep the ground moist...and in the middle a pine tree and shrubs, for the same purpose. Fresh sod was brought to them, the richest in worms that could be found: in vain did the worms seek concealment, when the Wood∣cock was hungry; it discovered them by the smell, stuck its bill into the ground, but never higher than the nostrils, drew them out singly, and raising its bill into the air, it extended upon it the entire length of the worm, and in this way swallowed it smoothly, without any action of the jaws. This whole operation was performed in an instant, and the motion of the Woodcock was so equal and imper∣ceptible, that it seemed doing nothing. I did not see it once miss its aim: for this reason, and because it never plunged its bill up to the orifice of the nostrils, I con∣cluded that smell is what directs it in search of its food." <HI>Natural History of Spain,</HI> by G.

But nature has given, at the extremity of its bill, an additional organ, appropriated to its mode of life; the tip is rather flesh than horn, and appears susceptible of a sort of touch, calculated for detecting its prey in the mire: and this advantageous structure has been bestowed also on the Snipes, and probably on the Red-shanks, the Jadnekas, and other birds which search for food in wet earth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This excellent remark was communicated by M. Hebert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bill of the Woodcock is rough, and almost barbed at the sides near the tip, and hollowed lengthwise with deep fur∣rows; the upper mandible alone forms the round point of the bill, projecting over the lower mandible, which is somewhat truncated, and fitted below by an oblique joint: it is from the length of its bill, that the name of the Woodcock is derived in most languages <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Greek name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies stake, and so does the Hebrew <HI>Kore:</HI> the German <HI>Lang-nasen,</HI> or <HI>Lang-schna∣bel,</HI> (long-nose, or long-neb) has a similar meaning.</NOTE>. The head is equally remarkable; it is rather square than round, and the cranium makes almost a right
<PB N="451" REF="499"/>
angle at the orbits of the eyes: its plum∣age, which Aristotle compares to that of the <HI>Attagas,</HI> or Red Grous, is too well known to require description; and the fine effect of the contrast of light and shade, produced by intermingled and broken tints, washed with gray, with bistre, and with umbre, would be tedious and difficult to describe in detail.</P>
<P>We found a gall bladder in the Wood∣cock, though Belon was persuaded that it had none; this bladder discharged a liquor by two ducts into the <HI>duodenum:</HI> besides the two ordinary <HI>caeca,</HI> we perceived a third placed about seven inches from the first, and which had a distinct communication with the intestinal canal; but as we ob∣served only one individual, this additional <HI>caecum</HI> may have been accidental. The gizzard is muscular, lined with a wrinkled inadhesive membrane; it often contains small bits of gravel, swallowed no doubt along with the earth-worms: the length of the intestines is two feet nine inches.</P>
<P>Gesner gives a juster notion of the bulk of the Woodcock, when he makes it equal to that of a Partridge, than Aristotle, who compares it to that of a Hen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristot. <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 26.</NOTE>. That com∣parison
<PB N="452" REF="500"/>
however would seem to shew, that the breed of poultry in ancient Greece was much smaller than ours. The Woodcock is always plump; and about the end of autumn, it is exceeding fat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina and Longolius say that it is fattened with a paste made of the meal of buck-wheat <HI>(farina d' orzo),</HI> and with figs: in a bird so shy and so fat in its proper season, we cannot imagine how this plan would be either practicable or useful.</NOTE>. At that season, and during the greatest part of the winter, it is reckoned one of the most exquisite dishes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It appears from Olina's account, that, in Italy, the Woodcocks are caught during the whole of the winter: the intense cold which prevails in France at the depth of that season, obliges the Woodcocks to shift their residence a little; yet some of them still remain in the woods, near the warm springs.</NOTE>; though its flesh is black and not very tender: that firmness makes it keep long untainted. It is cooked with∣out being emboweled; and its entrails pounded with their contents, make the best sauce for it. It is observed that dogs will not touch this game, and its odour must be offensive to them, for none but spaniels will fetch a Woodcock. The young birds have less <HI>fumet,</HI> but their flesh is whiter and tenderer. They all grow lean as the spring advances, and such as remain during the summer are dry, hard and rank.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="501"/>
It is in the end of winter, or in the month of March, that almost all the Wood∣cocks leave our plains, and return to their mountains invited by the pleasures of love and solitude <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. They are observed to retire in pairs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"They leave England in the beginning of the spring, after having paired, and the Cock and Hen fly together." <HI>Williughby.</HI></NOTE>, and they fly then rapidly, with∣out halting in the night; but in the morn∣ing, they conceal themselves in the woods, where they pass the day, and in the evening resume their journey <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Observation made by M.

During the whole of the summer, they live in the most soli∣tary and lofty parts of the mountains, where they breed; as in those of Savoy, of Switzerland, of Dauphiné, of Jura, of Bugey, and of the Vosges. A few remain in the hilly parts of England and of France; such as Burgundy, Champagne, &amp;c. And instances may occur of some pairs of Woodcocks halting even in our low pro∣vinces and nestling there; detained pro∣bably by accidents, and surprized by the season of love, when at a great distance from their proper retreats <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A Woodcock's nest was found on the 14th May 1773, on the estate of Pont-de-Remy, near Abbeville.</NOTE>.

<P>The Woodcock makes its nest on the ground, like the other birds which do not perch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Partridges, and other birds which seldom fly, nestle on the ground; of these also the Sky Lark, the Woodcock, and the Quail, never alight on a tree but on the ground." Aristotle, <HI>Lib. ix.</HI> 8.</NOTE>: in the construction, it employs leaves, or dry herbs, intermixed with small sticks; the whole artlessly fashioned and heaped against the trunk of a tree, or under a thick root. It lays four or five eggs, which are oblong, somewhat larger than those of a common Pigeon, of a rusty gray, marbled with deeper and blackish waves. One of these nests with the eggs, was brought to us, so early as the 15th of April. When the young are hatched, they leave the nest and run, though still covered with down: they begin even to fly before they have other feathers than those of the wings. They thus make their escape, flickering and tripping when disco∣vered. The parents sometimes take a weak one under their throat, and convey it more than a thousand paces; and the male
<PB N="455" REF="503"/>
never deserts the female, until the brood no longer need their assistance. He is never heard but in his amours, and during the education of the young; for, as well as his mate, he is silent the rest of the year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These weak cries are of different tones, passing from low to high, <HI>go, go, go, go; pidi, pidi, pidi; cri, cri, cri, cri:</HI> these last seem to be the expressions of anger between se∣veral males assembled together.

During incubation, he sits con∣stantly beside her; and they seem still to seek mutual enjoyment by resting their bill upon one anothers back. These birds, whose temper is solitary and wild, are disposed to tenderness and love: they are even liable to be jealous; for the males sometimes fight about the female, and peck one another until they fall to the ground. They become not therefore stupid and timo∣rous, till after they have lost the feeling of love, which almost ever inspires courage.</P>

<HEAD>Varieties of the WOODCOCK.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE WHITE WOODCOCK. This va∣riety is rare, at least in our climates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One was killed near Grenoble in the month of Decem∣ber 1774: <HI>Letter of M. de Morges, dated Grenoble 29th Febru∣ary</HI> 1775.</NOTE>. Some∣times its plumage is entirely white; oftener intermingled with some waves of gray or chesnut; its bill is yellowish-white; its legs pale yellow, with white nails: that circumstance would seem to shew that the whiteness is a different sort of degeneracy from the change of black into white, and much similar to that of the <HI>Blanchards</HI> in Negroes.</P>

<HEAD>The SAVANNA WOODCOCK. <HI>Scolopax Paludosae.</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Woodcock of Guiana, though one fourth smaller than that of France, has a still longer bill; it is also rather taller: its legs and bill are brown; light gray intersected and variegated with bars of black, predominates in its plumage, which is less mixed with rufous than in our Woodcock. With these exterior differ∣ences, which the climate has perhaps occa∣sioned, those of its oeconomy and habits, which it also produces, may be traced, in the Savanna Woodcock: it dwells constantly in those immense natural meadows where it is never molested by men or dogs; it lodges in the bottoms where the mud is collected, and where the herbs are thick and tall; avoiding however those shallows where the tide rises, and makes the water brack∣ish. In the rainy season, these Little Wood∣cocks
<PB N="461" REF="509"/>
remove to the uplands, and lodge among the grass: at this time they pair and nestle on the gentle elevations in holes lined with dry herbs. They lay only two eggs; but they have a second hatch, and in July, after the rains are over, they again descend into the bottom grounds, shifting their residence from the heights to the vallies the same way as those of Europe. When the Savannas are set on fire, which is often done in September and October, they escape in great numbers into the cir∣cumjacent tracts, but seem to avoid the woods, and when pursued they never halt, or endeavour to regain their ancient site; which is contrary to the habits of the European Woodcock. Yet they spring, like the latter, always under the sports∣man's feet; they make the same effort in rising, have the same noisy flight, and dis∣charge their excrement, too, in commenc∣ing their motion. If one is shot, it does not escape to a distance, but wheels round until it drops.

<P>IN the French and German languages the name of the Snipe is the diminutive of the appellation given to the Woodcock; and upon viewing its figure, we should naturally take it for a small species of that bird: <HI>It would be a little Woodcock,</HI> says Belon, <HI>were its habits not different.</HI> It has a very long bill, and a square head; its plumage is also speckled the same, except that the rufous is less intermingled, and that the light gray and the black predominate. But its resemblance to the Woodcock is con∣fined to externals only, and its natural
<PB N="464" REF="513"/>
habits are opposite. It never frequents the woods; it lives in wet meadows, or among the herbs and oziers which edge the brinks of streams. It soars to such height as to escape from view, though its cry is still heard; this is a feeble note like the bleat of a goat, <HI>mée, mée mée,</HI> which has induced some nomenclators to term it the <HI>Flying∣goat</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein, Schwenckfeld, Rzaczynski.</NOTE>: it also vents a short weak whistle in taking wing. It differs from the Wood∣cock as much, therefore, in its dispositions and habits, as it resembles that bird in its plumage and figure.</P>
<P>In France, the Snipes appear in autumn; they are seen sometimes three or four toge∣ther, but oftenest singly. They are flushed at a considerable distance, and fly very nimbly; and after three turnings, they shoot onwards two or three hundred paces, or tower aloft out of sight. The sports∣man can bend their course and lead them near him by imitating their voice. They continue the whole winter in our pro∣vinces, near the unfrozen fountains and the small contiguous bogs; they retire in great numbers in spring, which also appears to be the season of their arrival in many countries where they breed; as in Ger∣many <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>,
<PB N="465" REF="514"/>
in Silesia <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE> and in Switzerland <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>. But in France, a few Snipes remain the whole summer, and nestle in our marshes: Willughby makes the same remark with regard to England, they build in June, on the ground, beneath some large root of alder or willow, in morasses where the cat∣tle cannot reach: their nest is composed of dry herbs and feathers, and contains four or five oblong eggs, of a whitish colour, with rustly spots. The young ones leave their mansion, as soon as they burst from the shell; they appear ugly and shapeless: the mother nevertheless is affectionate to them, and never deserts them till their long bill is firm enough to enable them to pro∣cure easily their food.</P>
<P>The Snipe continually nibbles in the ground, though we can hardly say what it eats: nothing is found in its stomach but an earthy sediment and a watery liquor, which is probably the dissolved substance of the worms on which it feeds; for Aldro∣vandus remarks that its tongue is termi∣nated as in the Woodpeckers by a sharp point, proper for piercing the worms which it digs out of the mud.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="515"/>
The head of the Snipe has a horizontal balancing, and the tail a motion upwards and downwards; it walks leisurely, its head erect, without hopping or flickering: but seldom is it surprized in that state; for it carefully conceals itself among the rushes and herbage of slimy bogs, where the fowl∣ers cannot approach, without the assistance of a sort of rackets made of light deal, so broad as not to sink in the mud. And as the Snipe springs at a distance, with great rapidity, and makes several inflexions be∣fore it spins along its course; it is one of the most difficult birds to shoot. It may be caught easier with a springe, similar to what is set in paths for the Woodcock.</P>
<P>The Snipe has commonly abundance of fat, which is of a delicate flavour; and not apt to cloy like ordinary fat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; it is cooked like the Woodcock without extract∣ing the entrails, and is every where esteemed delicious game.</P>

<P>It would seem that there is a small kind of Snipes, as of Woodcocks; for besides the Jack-Snipe, of which we shall imme∣diately speak, there are, between these and

For this reason, sportsmen have given it the epithet <HI>deaf.</HI> It flies swifter and more direct than the Common Snipe; its flesh is not inferior, and

the fat as delicate. But the species is not so numerous, or at least, not so widely diffused: Willughby remarks, that it is less frequent in England: Linnaeus omits it in his enumeration of the Swedish birds; but it is found in Denmark, according to Brunnich. The Jack-Snipe has a propor∣tionally shorter bill than the Common Snipe; its plumage is the same, with some copper-reflexions on the back and long rusty dashes on the feathers which are laid on the sides of the back, and which being long, silky and somewhat filamentous, have probably given occasion to the German name <HI>haar-schnepffe</HI> or <HI>Hair-snipe.</HI></P>
<P>These birds are stationary, and breed in our marshes; their eggs are of the same colour with those of the Common Snipes, but smaller, corresponding to their bulk, which exceeds not that of a Lark. They have often been taken for the males of the ordinary kind, and Willughby corrects that popular error, owning at the same time, that before comparing them he enter∣tained the same notion.

<HEAD>The BARGES.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the volatile beings on which na∣ture has bestowed so much vivacity and grace, and which she seem to have dif∣fused through the grand scene of her pro∣ductions, to animate and fill up the void space; the Marsh-birds are those to which she has been the most sparing of her favours. Their perceptions are obtuse, and their mode of subsistence constrains them to spend their lives amidst the fens searching in the mud and wet soil: and the inha∣bitants of the primaeval slime seem not to participate in the happy progress which all the other productions of the universe have made towards perfection, aided and embellished by the industry of man.</P>
<P>None of them has the gaiety or the ele∣gance of the rural songsters; they cannot toy and frolick, or wanton in harmless combats: they only fly from one cold marsh to another; chained to the damp ground, they cannot like the tenants of the grove, sport amidst the boughs, or even alight on them: during the day, they keep in the shade; and their weak sight and natural
<PB N="477" REF="526"/>
timidity, makes them prefer the obscurity of the night. In searching for their food, they are also indebted to their eyes rather than to their touch and their smell. Such is the life of the Woodcocks, of the Snipes, and other birds of the marsh; among which the Barges form a small family immediately below that of the Snipes. The shape of their body is the same; but their bill is still longer, though fashioned similarly with a blunt smooth tip, and straight, or a little bent and slightly raised. Gesner is mis∣taken when he describes their bill as sharp and proper for darting fishes; for they live only on worms, which they extract from the mud. Their gizzard also contains lit∣tle pebbles, mostly transparent like those in the gizzard of the Avoset. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An observation made by M.

<P>"THE French, says Belon, seeing a tall little bird, squatting upon its legs as if seated on horseback, denominated it the <HI>Horseman."</HI> It would be difficult to discover another etymology of their name.

<P>IT appears to be as large as the Golden Plover, because it is very thickly clothed with feathers; a property which belongs to all the Horsemen. It measures near a foot from the bill to the tail, and a little more from the bill to the nails; almost all its plumage is clouded with light gray and rufous; all the feathers are fringed with these two colours, and blackish in the middle; the same white and rusty are finely dotted on the head, spread on the wing, and border its small feathers; the great ones are blackish; the underside of the body and the rump are white. Brisson says that the legs of this bird are pale-red, and he accordingly applies epithets to it, which would better suit the following species, which is perhaps only a variety of the present.</P>

It also ate bread soaked in water, but the maceration needed to be continued a whole day. Moulting gave it, in the month of August, new feathers to the wings, and it eloped in September. It was grown very familiar, insomuch that it followed the gardener, when he brought it food. If it saw him break off the leaf of a plant, it ran to pick up the worms that were dislodged: as soon as it had eaten, it repaired to wash itself in a bowl filled with water.

and England; and in all these countries they are believed to come from the north. They are known also on the shores of the German-ocean, and are numerous in Swe∣den, particularly in Scania <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>: they occur likewise in Denmark and in Norway <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zoolog.

Since they appear regularly on our coasts in the spring, and stay two or three months, it would seem, that they seek the temperate climates; and if observers had not assured us, that they come from the north, we might justly draw the opposite inference, that they arrive from the south. I should therefore presume that it is the case with these birds as with the Woodcocks, which are said to come from the east, and return to the west or the south, but which only descend from the mountains to the plains and again retire to their heights. It is even probable that the Ruffs remain in the same country, only shifting to different parts of it accord∣ing to the change of seasons; and if their battles be seen only in the spring, it is
<PB N="500" REF="552"/>
probable, that at other times, they pass unobserved, intermingled perhaps with the Dusky Sandpipers, or the Horsemen, to which they bear great analogy.</P>
<P>The Ruffs and Reeves are nearly the stature of the Red-shanks, though their legs are not quite so tall; the bill has the same form, but shorter. The females are com∣monly smaller than the males <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynski.</NOTE>, and resem∣ble them in their plumage, which is white with a mixture of brown on the upper surface. But the males in the spring are so different from one another, that each might be taken for a bird of a distinct species: of more than a hundred, compared by Klein at the house of the governor of Scania, there were only two precisely simi∣lar; they varied either in shape or in the bulk of their swelled ruff round the neck. The feathers which compose that bunch appear in the beginning of the spring, and remain only during the season of love. But besides the exuberance of growth at that time, the superabundance of organic mole∣cules displays itself also in the eruption of fleshy turgid pimples on the foreside of the head and round the eyes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, <HI>Fauna Sueciea.</HI></NOTE>. This double pro∣duction
<PB N="501" REF="553"/>
implies great prolific powers in the Ruffs. "I know of no bird, M. Bail∣lon writes us, in which the appetite of love is more ardent; none whose testicles are so large in proportion, each being near six lines in diameter, and an inch or more in length; the other organs of gene∣ration are equally dilated in the season of its amours. We may judge of the impe∣tuosity of their hostile assaults, from the strength of that passion which blows up the fires of jealousy and rivalship. I have often followed these birds in our marshes (in Lower Picardy) where they arrive in the month of April with the Horsemen, but in smaller numbers. Their first object is to pair, or rather to contend for the females, whose feeble screams rouse and exasperate the antagonists; and the battle is long, obstinate, and sometimes bloody. The van∣quished betakes himself to flight, but the cry of the first female which he hears, dispels his fears and awakens his courage; and he again renews the conflict, if another oppo∣nent appears. These skirmishes are repeated every morning or evening until the depar∣ture of the birds, which happens sometime in May; for only a few stragglers remain, and their nests are never found in our marshes."</P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="554"/>
This accurate and very intelligent ob∣server remarks, that they leave Picardy with a south, or south or south-east wind, which carries them to the English coasts, where they breed in very great numbers, particularly in the fens of Lincolnshire. In that county, they afford considerable sport: the fowler watches the instant when they are fighting, and throws his net over them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.

They bristle in a threatning manner when the bird makes an attack, and their colours form the chief difference between the indi∣viduals. In some, these feathers are rufous, and in others, gray; in some, white, and in others, of a fine violet black, broken with rufous spots: the white complexion is most rare.

<P>This beautiful ornament drops in a moult which these bird undergo about the end of June; as if nature reserved her decorations and armour for the season of love and of war: the vermilion tubercles grow pale, and obliterate, and their place becomes occupied by feathers: the males are no longer to be distinguished from the females, and they all abandon the places

They are fattened with milk, hempseed, and sometimes with boiled wheat; and to hasten the process, sugar is frequently added.

But this lonely savage mode of life does not extinguish its sensi∣bility; at least its voice has a manifest expression of sentiment: it is a gentle sweet whistle, modulated, with accents of lan∣guor, which being diffused over the placid surface of the water, or mingled with its murmur, inspires reflection and tender melancholy. It would appear, that this is the same bird with what is called the <HI>Sifflasson (the Whistler)</HI> on the Lake of Geneva, where it is caught by the call, with limed bull-rushes. It is known also on the
<PB N="511" REF="564"/>
Lake of Nantua, where it is terminated the <HI>Pivette,</HI> or Green foot. It is seen likewise in the month of June on the Rhone and the Saone; and in autumn among the gravel on the Ouche in Burgundy. These birds occur, too, on the Seine; and it is remarked that though solitary the whole summer, they form small bodies of five or six in the time of their passage, and are heard in the air in still nights. In Lorraine, they arrive in the month of April, and retire in July <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations of M. Lottinger.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus the Green Sandpiper, though at∣tached to the same place during the time of its stay, passes from one country into ano∣ther, even in those seasons when most other birds are detained by the duties of incuba∣tion. Though seen two thirds of the year in the coasts of Lower Picardy, it cannot be said to breed there: it is called the <HI>Little Horseman</HI> in those parts <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observations on the birds of our West coasts, commu∣nicated by M. Baillon.</NOTE>; it haunts the mouths of rivers, and follows the tides; it picks up the little fry of fish, and worms, on the sand which is left bare and covered alternately by a thin sheet of water. The flesh of the Green Sandpiper is very deli∣licate, and even superior in flavour to that
<PB N="512" REF="565"/>
of the Snipe, according to Belon, though it has a slight odour of musk. As it per∣petually wags its tail in walking, natura∣lists have applied to it the name <HI>Cinclus,</HI> whose primitive signifies to shake or agi∣tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and this from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to move.</NOTE>: but that character belongs as much to the common Sandpiper, or to the Purre; and a passage of Aristotle proves clearly, that the term does not correspond to the Green Sandpiper. That philosopher deno∣minates the three smallest Marsh Birds <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: "Of these, says he, the <HI>Cinclus</HI> and <HI>Schoeniclus</HI> are the smallest, and the <HI>Trinjas</HI> the largest, being equal to a Thrush." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Animal, <HI>Lib. viii.</HI> 4.</NOTE> The <HI>Tringas</HI> is therefore indicated by its bulk to be the same with the Green Sandpiper; but we have not <HI>data</HI> to decide whether the two others correspond to the common Sandpiper, or to the Purre, or to our little <HI>Cincle.</HI> But nothing can equal the confusion in which nomenclators have involved this subject: some term the Green Sandpiper the <HI>Water-hen,</HI> others the <HI>Sea-partridge;</HI> some, as we have seen, call it by the name <HI>Cincle,</HI> but the greater number apply the term <HI>Tringa;</HI> perverting its signi∣fication however by making it generic.
<PB N="513" REF="566"/>
Hence the profusion of epithets and phrases that have been employed, and the multitude of inaccurate figures and of vague references: and Klein justly laments the impossibility of reconciling the chaos of descriptions which abound in the works of authors, who have blindly copied and compiled, without consulting nature, <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Green Sandpiper, <HI>Tringa Ochropus:</HI> "The tip of its bill is pointed, its legs green∣ish, its back brown-green; its belly and its utmost tail∣quills, white."</NOTE></P>

<P>IT exactly resembles the preceding in its form and plumage, only smaller. Its throat and belly are white; its breast spotted with gray dashes on white; its back and rump gray, not spotted with white, but slightly waved with black, with a small streak of that colour on the shaft of each feather; and upon the whole, there is a reddish reflection; the tail is a little longer and more spread, than that of the Green Sandpiper: it likewise wags its tail as it walks; and hence some naturalists have termed it <HI>Motacilla,</HI> which has already been bestowed on a multititude of small birds.</P>
<P>The Sandpiper lives solitary by the verge of water, and haunts the sandy strands and shores. Many of these birds are seen near the sources of the Moselle in the Vosges, where they are called <HI>Lambiche.</HI> It leaves that country in the month of July, after having reared its young.</P>

It springs at a distance, and utters some screams <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>; and it is heard during the night to cry on the beach with a wailing voice: and the same property seems to belong to the Green Sandpiper <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Pilvenckegen,</HI> according to Willughby, represented by Gesner as a moaning bird.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Both these species advance far into the north <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> Nos, 147, and 152.</NOTE>, and have thence migrated into the cold and temperate parts of the New Con∣tinent: in fact, a Green Sandpiper which was sent to us from Louisiana, seemed to differ little or nothing from that of Europe <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Sandpiper, <HI>Tringa Hypo∣leucos:</HI> "Its bill is smooth, its legs livid; its body cine∣reous, with black dashes, below white."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The SEA PARTRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE name <HI>Partridge</HI> has very impro∣perly been applied to this bird; since the only relation consists in a small resem∣blance of the bill, which is pretty short, convex above, compressed at the sides, and curved near the point, as in the gallina∣ceous tribes. In the form of its body and the fashion of its feathers, it bears more analogy to the Swallows; for its tail is forked, its wings have great extent and stretch to a point. Some authors have called it <HI>Glareola,</HI> alluding to its frequent∣ing the strands by the sea-shore. It feeds chiefly on worms and Aquatic insects. It also haunts the brinks of brooks and rivers, as on the Rhine near Strasburg, where according to Gesner it has the German appellation <HI>Kappriegerle.</HI> Kramer deno∣minates it <HI>Pratincola (Prati-incola)</HI> because he saw many of them in the extensive mea∣dows which border on a certain lake in Lower Austria. But whether it inhabits the verge of rivers and lakes, or the sea∣shore, it universally prefers the strands and sandy channels, to the muddy bottoms.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="571"/>
We know four species or varieties of these Sea-partridges which seem to form a small distinct family amidst the numerous tribe of little Shore-birds.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="species">
<HEAD>The GRAY SEA-PARTRIDGE. <HI>First Species. Hirundo-Pratincola.</HI> Linn. <HI>Glareola-Austria.</HI> Gmel. <HI>Pratincola.</HI> Klein. <HI>Glareola.</HI> Briss. <HI>Hirundo Marina.</HI> Ray. Will. and Johnst. &amp;c. <HI>The Austrian Pratincole.</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS, with the following species, ap∣pears sometimes, though seldom, on the rivers in some of the provinces of France, particularly in Lorraine, where Lottinger assures us he has seen it. All the plumage is gray, tinged with rufous on the flanks and on the small quills of the wings; the throat only is white inclosed by a black rim; the rump is white, and the legs red: it is nearly as large as a Blackbird. The Sea-swallow of Aldrovandus, which, in other respects, is much analogous to this species, appears to form a variety, it hav∣ing, according to that naturalist, very black legs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="species">
<PB N="518" REF="572"/>
<HEAD>The BROWN SEA-PARTRIDGE. <HI>Second Species. Glareola Senegalensis.</HI> Gmel. and Briss. <HI>Tringa Fusca.</HI> Linn. <HI>The Senegal Pratincole.</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THIS species, which is found in Senegal and is of the same size with the pre∣ceding, differs however in being entirely brown. We are inclined to think that this variation results from the influence of climate.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="species">
<HEAD>The GIAROLE. <HI>Third Species. Glareola Naevia.</HI> Gmel. and Briss. <HI>Gallinula Melampus.</HI> Aldrov. Gesn. Ray and Klein. <HI>The Spotted Pratincole.</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>GIAROLA is the name which this bird receives in Italy. Aldrovandus pro∣perly refers to it the <HI>Melampus (Black-foot)</HI> of Gesner, all those of this genus being distinguished by their black legs. The German appellation <HI>Rotknillis (red-clouded)</HI>
<PB N="519" REF="573"/>
alludes to the reddish ground of its plum∣age, spotted with whitish or brown; the wing is cinereous, and its quills black.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="species">
<HEAD>The COLLARED SEA-PARTRIDGE. <HI>Fourth Species. Glareola Austriaca. Var.</HI> 1. Gmel. <HI>Glareola Torquata.</HI> Briss.</HEAD>
<P>THE German name of this bird <HI>Riegerle,</HI> implies that it is perpetually in motion. In fact, when it hears any noise, it is alarmed, and runs or flies away with a fee∣ble shrill cry. It frequents the shores, and its habits are perhaps the same with those of the Common Sandpiper. But if we admit the accuracy of Gesner's figure, both the form of its bill and the colours of its plumage, import its relation to the Sea-partridges: the back is cinereous, and also the upper surface of the wing, of which the great quills are blackish; the head is black, with two white lines on the eyes; the neck is white, and a brown circle surrounds it below like a collar; the bill is black, and the legs yel∣lowish.
<PB N="520" REF="574"/>
It is one of the smallest species: Schwenckfeld says that it breeds on the sandy brinks of rivers, and lays seven oblong eggs; he adds that it runs very fast, and, in the summer nights, utters a little scream <HI>tul, tul,</HI> with a ringing voice.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>

<PB N="521" REF="575"/>
<HEAD>The SEA-LARK. <HI>Tringa Cinclus.</HI> Linn. and Gmel. <HI>The Least Snipe.</HI> Sloane and Brown. <HI>The Purre, or Stint</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Sussex, it is called the Ox-eye, according to Ray. T.</NOTE>. Penn. and Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this bird has the name of Lark, it bears scarce any resemblance to it, except in its bulk and in the plumage of its back <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>: in its form and its habits, it is entirely different. It lives by the verge of water; and never leaves the shores; the under part of its thigh is naked, and its bill slender, cylindrical, and obtuse, as in the other <HI>Scolopacious</HI> birds, and this is only shorter in proportion than that of the Jack-snipe, which it resembles in its air and figure.</P>
<P>It prefers the sea-coast, though it also frequents the rivers; it flies in flocks often so thick that a number may be killed by a single shot; and Belon expresses his won∣der to find the markets on our coasts so well supplied with these birds. According to him, the flesh is better than that of a common Lark; but if kept for any length
<PB N="522" REF="576"/>
of time, it contracts an oily taste. When one is killed, the rest crowd round the sportsman, as if to protect their compa∣nion. Faithful to each other, they give a mutual scream in rising, and in a body skim along the surface of the water. At night, they are heard to call and cry on the strands and little islets.</P>
<P>They assemble in autumn; those which had separated to breed re unite with their new families which usually consist of four or five young. The eggs are very large in proportion to the size of the bird: they are dropped on the naked sand. The Com∣mon and Green Sandpipers have the same habits, and build no nest. The Sea Lark procures its prey along the shore, walking, and perpetually wagging its tail.</P>
<P>These birds pass into other countries; and it appears that on some of our coasts, they are migratory only. Of this we are assured, at least with regard to Lower Picardy, by an excellent observer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon.</NOTE>: there they arrive in the month of September with the west∣erly winds, and make only a transient halt; they will not suffer a person to approach to them nearer than twenty paces, which would make us conjecture that they are not
<PB N="523" REF="577"/>
hunted in the country from whence they come.</P>
<P>They must also have penetrated far into the north, and have passed into the other continent; for the species is found to be settled in Louisiana <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Page du Pratz; <HI>Hist. de la Louisiane, tom. ii. p.</HI> 118.</NOTE> in the Antilles <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Sea-larks and other small Sea-birds are astonishingly numerous in all the salt marshes, <HI>Dutertre,</HI> tom. xi. p. 277.</NOTE>. Jamaica <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sloane and Browne.</NOTE>, St. Domingo and in Cayenne <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">"Every year these birds are seen in Cayenne, and on the whole coast; they assemble at spring tides, and some∣times in such numbers, that the banks of the rivers where the influx reaches are covered with them, either on the ground or in the air; their flocks are so thick, that a person will sometimes kill forty or fifty of them at one shot. The inhabitants of Cayenne also hunt them at night on the sands, where these birds eat the little worms left by the sea. They sometimes perch on the mangroves by the water's edge; their flesh is very good eating. In the rainy season, they are very numerous in St. Domingo and Martinico; but it is uncertain how they breed, or where they lay their eggs." <HI>Remarks made by M. de la Borde, King's physician at Cayenne.</HI></NOTE>. The two Sea-larks from St. Domingo which Brisson has given separately, appear to be only varieties of the European species. In the Old Continent they are spread from north to south; for according to Kolben it occurs in the Cape of Good Hope, and Willughby and Sibald represent the <HI>Stint</HI> as a native of Scotland. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Purre or Stint, <HI>Tringa-Cin∣clus:</HI> "Its bill and legs are black, its straps white, its tail and rump gray and brown."</NOTE></P>

<P>ARISTOTLE has applied the name <HI>Cinclos</HI> to the least of all the Shore∣birds; and we have adopted it. It appears to be subordinate to the preceding species; rather smaller, not so tall; it has the same colours, with this single difference, that they are more distinct; the dashes on the upper surface are more finely traced, and there is a zone of spots of the same colour on the breast: which has induced Brisson to call it the <HI>Collared Sea Lark.</HI> In other respects, it has the habits of that bird, and it often associates with it. Its tail has a sort of tremulous motion, which Aristotle seems to ascribe to his <HI>Cinclos.</HI> But we have not been able to discover in it the other pro∣perties which he mentions; viz. that being once caught it grows very tame, though it shews much cunning in avoiding snares. With regard to the long and obscure disser∣tation
<PB N="525" REF="579"/>

<P>To the history of the Land-birds we shall subjoin the following particu∣lars, tending to throw light on the subject.</P>
<P>The husbandmen of antiquity were di∣rected in their agricultural labours by the rising of some noted constellations, by the appearance of certain birds, and by the flowering of particular plants. An atten∣tion to these phenomena is now super∣seded by our simple and accurate chrono∣logy; yet as a subject of curiosity, it ought not to be wholly disregarded. With this view one of the disciples of Linnaeus con∣structed, at Upsal in Sweden, what he terms a <HI>Calendar of Flora.</HI> We have se∣lected from it the circumstances relating to birds, and have joined the observations made at Stratton in Norfolk, by Mr. Stil∣ling fleet. Upsal is in latitude 598 51′, Stratton in 52° 45′.</P>
