your Protection: if it falls short of

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and WRITINGS
OF
OPPIAN.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Esteem we have for the Writings of an
admired Author naturally leads us into an
enquiry concerning his Country and personal
Character, together with the Time and Cir∣cumstances
of his Life; so we generally receive the best
information in these particulars from some passages in
the same Writings that engaged our Curiosity. How∣ever
the <HI>Ancients</HI> may vary in their Accounts, <HI>Oppian</HI>
himself, in dedicating his <HI>Halieuticks</HI> to <HI>Severus</HI> and his
Son <HI>Caracalla,</HI> has ascertain'd the time in which he wrote
his first Piece; and because we find him only in this
Poem complimenting both Father and Son as then
reigning with joynt Power, and the same Reasons that
first moved him to write obliged him to be as speedy
as possible in his application to his Royal Patrons: 'tis
highly probable he presented this Piece, and this only,
to <HI>Severus</HI> in that Emperour's Life time. <HI>Rittershusius,</HI>
the most learned Editor of his Works, has made a great
slip in fixing his Birth in the reign of <HI>Severus;</HI> which
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
taking in only the compass of eighteen years, it is
very unlikely he should at such an age finish so com∣pleat
a Poem. We must suppose then that he might
be born in the former part of <HI>Commodus</HI>'s Reign; which
cannot be charged with the like absurdity as the for∣mer
Opinion.</P>
<P>All who speak of him (except <HI>Suidas</HI>) agree that he
was born at <HI>Anazarbus,</HI> a City of <HI>Cilicia;</HI> which place
likewise gave birth to those eminent Physicians <HI>Ascle∣piades</HI>
and <HI>Dioscorides. Suidas</HI> indeed makes him a Na∣tive
of <HI>Corycus;</HI> but <HI>Oppian</HI> refutes that himself in the
third <HI>Halieutick</HI> by distinguishing his Countrymen from
their neighbours the <HI>Corycians.</HI> His Father <HI>Agesilaus</HI>
was a man of wealth and figure in <HI>Anazarbus;</HI> but
being a reserved and philosophical person, when <HI>Se∣verus,</HI>
taking a progress through <HI>Cilicia,</HI> made his en∣trance
into that City, he avoided the hurry and fati∣gue
of that Solemnity, and hoped his Studies might
have excused the formality of attendance. But <HI>Seve∣rus,</HI>
a Prince of a rough and suspicious temper, took this
as an instance of contempt, and resented his non-ap∣pearance
so far as to banish the old Gentleman into
the Island of <HI>Malta.</HI> The pious Son could not de∣sert
his Father under this unhappy circumstance, but
voluntarily accompanied him in his Exile. Perhaps it
was to this melancholly Retirement that we are in∣debted
for one of the finest Remains of Antiquity:
indeed it too often happens that the noblest Produ∣ctions
of great Wits, are owing to the misfortunes of
their Authors. Men of gallant Spirits frustrate the
malicious intents of Fortune, and lay the foundation
of their Glory in Disappointments. 'Twas thus <HI>Virgil</HI>
and <HI>Horace</HI> were introduced into the acquaintance of
the <HI>Muses,</HI> who made <HI>Augustus</HI> their Patron, and Po∣sterity
their Admirers. <HI>Oppian</HI> had doubtless been en∣gaged
in those Diversions he could describe so well,
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
with as keen a pursuit as other young Gentlemen of
his age, and perhaps with no other views; but Ad∣versity
only could make them the materials of his stu∣dies,
and refine his Recreations into Poetry.</P>
<P>In the time of his Banishment having leisure and op∣portunity,
both by reading and experience, to en∣quire
into the Nature of Animals, he composed three
Poems, each containing five Books, of the Nature,
and several kinds of <HI>Fishes, Beasts,</HI> and <HI>Birds,</HI> and
the manner of taking them; which few or none had
attempted in Verse before. <HI>Epicharmus</HI> indeed and
many besides had studied the Nature of Animals; and
others had treated of the Arts used in Fishing and
Hunting, but most of them wrote after a dry man∣ner,
and contented themselves with a bare recital of
Names, without any thing Poetical in their Composi∣tions,
but the Verse; and none of them had strength
of Genius sufficient to take in the whole Subject, or
wrote with that sublimity of thought, and accuracy of
judgment, as our Author has done.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian</HI> had doubtless perused the Works of the An∣cient
Naturalists, particularly those of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> though
he often differs in opinion from that great Man, and
sometimes disagrees with him in account of matters of
fact; he has besides many Names and Relations of
<HI>Fishes,</HI> which are not to be found in <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Colle∣ction,
or in any other Naturalist. The last Book of
his <HI>Cynegeticks</HI> (for it is certain he wrote five) is lost;
of the <HI>Hixeuticks</HI> there is is only a Greek Paraphrase
remaining; though the Learned have been long amu∣sed
with expectations of the Original Poem, which is
said to have lain concealed in the <HI>Italian</HI> Libraries.
But by lucky chance we have his most finished Piece the
<HI>Halieuticks</HI> entire; and Time which, as Sr. <HI>William
Temple</HI> says, <HI>like a River, lets things of worth and weight
sink and be lost, but carries with it the light and trifling,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
has yet wafted down to us this solid and valuable Re∣main
of Antiquity. This, though the first composed,
seems to have been the most laboured and correct of
all his Writings: There appears less of youthful heat,
and flash of fancy, and greater depth of judgment in
his <HI>Halieuticks</HI> than in his <HI>Cynegeticks:</HI> The Compli∣ment
at the end of the former is more artificial and
just, and not stretcht into such youthful flights as that
in the beginning of the latter. <HI>Oppian</HI> knew that it
was this his first Work on which all his hopes depended,
his own, and (what was much dearer to him) his Fa∣ther's
Releasment. He therefore chose an uncommon,
though in itself a pleasant Subject; which he adorned
with all the Embellishments it was capable of receiving
from a bright and luxuriant Fancy tempered with sound∣ness
and strength of Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian</HI> thought it much more honourable to merit
his Release by some valuable Work, than to endeavour
to extort it by Prayer. In this he show'd a greater
reach of thought than Ovid in those tedious <HI>Descri∣ptions
of his Banishment.</HI> Querulous people are gene∣rally
but little regarded; they lessen themselves by
their impatience, and give an uneasiness to the Hearer:
but he who sings his own misfortunes has this disad∣vantage
by his Poetry, that all men will think those
miseries, which can be so artfully described, to be little
less than Fiction. Our Author was so cautious of this,
that he takes care never to mention his own Exile;
only once, when it was almost unavoidable, he touches
upon the miseries of Banishment, but with so fine a
turn, as shews the delicacy of his taste and exactness
of his judgment. Nor was he deceived in the hopes
he had entertained of pleasing the Emperour; for
when, according to the custom of those times, he had
in a publick Theatre recited his <HI>Halieuticks, Severus</HI>
was so ravished with the Sweetness of the Composition,
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
and the Novelty of the Subject, that he bid him ask
what he would, nothing should be denied him. The
pious Son had now an opportunity of obtaining all he
desired, the restoring his Father <HI>Agesilaus</HI> to his Liber∣ty
and Country. His insisting only on this, after so ge∣neral
an offer, could not but very much increase that
esteem his personal merit had before entitled him to;
and that Prince not only granted him his request, but
presented him with an additional reward of a<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">3506 Staters of Gold each containing about <HI>16s. 4d</HI> of our money.</NOTE> <HI>Stater</HI>
of Gold for each Verse; a generous and princely Gra∣tuity,
and an handsome Compliment to modest Worth,
and Poetry.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Writers of his Life say he writ many ad∣mirable
Poems, besides those of <HI>Fishing, Hunting</HI> and
<HI>Fowling;</HI> and <HI>Oppian</HI> himself informs us that he had a
design to do honour to his Country in an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem,
of which he gives us a Specimen in his Description of
the inundation of the <HI>Orontes,</HI> and the draining of that
River by <HI>Hercules;</HI> at the conclusion of which story he
thus expresses himself;
<Q><L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cyneget 2 Book verse 156.</NOTE> But when I sing my dearest Country's praise,</L>
<L>This Theme shall shine in more exalted Lays.</L>
<L>Mean while the Scenes of Sylvan Toil excuse,</L>
<L>And hunting Arts engage the willing Muse.</L></Q></P>
<P>Our Author had doubtless a Genius sufficient for
<HI>Epic</HI> Poetry, but it is not probable he lived to begin,
much less to finish that intended Work; for soon after
his favourable reception at the Court of <HI>Severus,</HI> when
being returned to his Country this unfortunate good
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
Man had begun to enjoy the pleasures of that Liberty
the <HI>Muses</HI> had obtained for him, he was seized with
the Plague, which put a period to his Life in the thir∣tieth
year of his age. Thus died <HI>Oppian</HI> the last of the
<HI>Ancient Poets:</HI> the Citizens of <HI>Anazarbus</HI> were extream∣ly
concerned at so irrecoverable a loss, in being depri∣ved
of one who was already the Glory of his Nation.
But nothing could be done more than to bestow the
highest honours on his Funeral. To express the high
opinion they had of him, and what hopes they had con∣ceived
from so promising a <HI>Genius,</HI> they erected him a
Statue with this pompous Inscription.</P>
<Q><L>Though much they lov'd, no <HI>Heliconian</HI> Maid</L>
<L>Could <HI>Oppian</HI> save, or sullen Fate perswade;</L>
<L>The rigid <HI>Destinies</HI> superiour Pow'r</L>
<L>Snapt quick the thread, and fixt the hasten'd hour.</L>
<L>But had these <HI>Sisters</HI> like the <HI>Nine</HI> been kind,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Oppian</HI>'s life to thrice ten years confin'd;</L>
<L>All the Inspir'd had him their Chief allow'd,</L>
<L>And all to his their humbler Lawrels bow'd.</L></Q>
<P>As for the other part of the Character of our Poet,
which we have not in the Historical Accounts of his
Life, we may in a great measure draw it from his
Writings. For though <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Catullus</HI> would have
us believe that luscious Verses are consistent with per∣sonal
Chastity; yet it is certain one may give a shrewd
guess at the Manners, Principles, and Disposition of
an Author, from the uniform Character, and general
Tendency of his Writings; because every one makes
choice of such Subjects, and gives them such a turn
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
as is most agreeable to his own Temper. Now there
is such an inartificial and unaffected strain of Piety
and Good Nature in every Page of our Author's works,
as had we no History of his Life, would represent him
to us under the amiable Character of a young Gentle∣man
of the liveliest Wit, sweeten'd with the most en∣gaging
Virtue, and ennobled by Religion. In all his
Digressions and Reflections, he recommends Virtue
with so agreeable an air, and discountenances Vice af∣ter
so moving a manner, as shows him to have been
the <HI>best good Man,</HI> but far from having the <HI>worst natur'd
Muse.</HI></P>
<P>I could never find that Natural Affection, which the
<HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, so well exprest in any Poet as him.
His Similitudes and Allusions have almost all a refe∣rence
to this; His Images are all made up of Piety,
Friendship, Gratitude and Innocence. No one ever
better mixt the Gentleman and the Philosopher than
this Author has done. He shews his Learning and Edu∣cation
by many fine <HI>Essays</HI> and <HI>Digressions,</HI> but without
the least affectation, and only when the Subject re∣quires
it. His <HI>Moral Reflections</HI> are very fine and ju∣dicious,
as those on <HI>Sympathy, Love, Jealousie, human
Industry, the Nature of Man,</HI> and the like. His <HI>Reli∣gious
Sentiments,</HI> considering he was a Heathen, are ve∣ry
conspicuous in his account of <HI>Providence, the Neces∣sity
of divine Aid, and the Punishments that attend the Vi∣tious.</HI>
His <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or <HI>good sense</HI> was no less apparent,
in that under the miseries of Banishment, he could
refrain not only from railing against the Cruelty of
others, but even from complaining of his own Hard∣ships.
As he was capable of improving every thing,
so he made choice of a Subject which though noble in
it's self, was yet too much neglected (as it is now) by
the Poets of those days, who, either through want
of reading, or deterred by the seeming difficulty of
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
managing it with success, would not undertake so la∣borious
a Task.</P>
<P><HI>Natural History</HI> is a divine speculation to the Reli∣gious,
and no less agreeable to the Curious; as there
is no Subject more excellent in it's nature, or more capa∣ble
of being adorned, if it fall into able hands, so
there is none that reflects a greater honour on an Au∣thor,
or is more conducive to the ends of Poetry, the
Delight and Instruction of the Reader. The glorious
Dangers and Exploits of Heroes, the Splendour and
Triumphs that attend Victory, which are the usual
Subjects of an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, are things that we admire
in common with the gross of mankind; but to trace
the footsteps of Providence among inferiour ranks of
Creatures, and to contemplate their constant Regula∣rity
in promoting the ends of their Creation, is an
Entertainment which only refined Understandings are
capable of relishing. The Design of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI> is
either to enforce some Political Maxim, or to pay an
artful Compliment to his Prince and Country in the
persons of their Ancestors: but the <HI>Naturalist</HI> pursues
a more noble end, while by pointing out the Beauties
of Nature, he imprints in our minds worthy and ratio∣nal
Notions of the Deity. Besides the Nature of his
Subject obliges him in a great measure to avoid those
Corruptions, which other Poets have introduced into
the Heathen Theology, by engaging their Gods in
amorous Intrigues, Quarrels, and sometimes in actual
War against one another. The Deities of the <HI>Natu∣ralist,</HI>
each within his own District, are employed in
the Functions usually assigned to their Natures, and
promoting the good of the Universe in Subordination
to <HI>Jupiter</HI> their Supreme; which is allow'd to be the
most rational System of the Heathen Divinity.</P>
<P>'Tis one of the most admirable Secrets in Poetry to
heighten small things by a noble manner of Expres∣sion;
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
the meaner therefore any Subject is, the more
capable it is of being adorned. As there is a regular
Gradation of created Beings from Man down to the
lowest Vegetable, the <HI>Naturalist</HI> seems to have the
advantage in a Subject which is capable of being im∣proved
by borrowing it's Metaphors and Allusions from
Objects of a superiour Nature. His Trees and Plants
are influenced with the passions of Desire and Aver∣sion,
Joy and Grief; and his Animals seem to rival
Mankind in their Virtues and Perfections. The <HI>Na∣turalist</HI>
and <HI>Epic</HI> Poet borrow mutually from each
other: the one, in magnifying the Character of his
Hero, finds himself obliged to fetch his Comparisons
from the most remarkable Qualities of inferiour Crea∣tures,
the other, after a more easy and natural man∣ner,
adds a dignity to his Subject by alluding to the
Hero. The Imagination is agreeably surprized at the
figure the Vegetive Creation makes under the promo∣tion
to which it is advanced by the daring Metaphors
of the Poet: but in point of Instruction the History
of Animals claims the preference. Those Faculties in
the Souls of Brutes, which bear an Analogy to the
Will and Passions, and enable them to act with a re∣semblance
of the Virtues and Vices of Mankind, fur∣nish
the Poet with frequent occasions of insinuating
the Precepts of Morality after the most easy and per∣swasive
manner. While he represents in the most
lively colours their natural Affection and Piety, their
generous Friendship, Courage, and Contempt of death,
he seems to upbraid Mankind either with the want of
those Virtues, or not possessing them in a far superiour
degree. The <HI>Wisest of Men,</HI> when he bids the <HI>Sluggard
go to the Ant, consider her ways, and be wise,</HI> by recom∣mending
to his imitation the parsimonious <HI>Insect,</HI> ra∣ther
than the most industrious of his own <HI>Species,</HI> seems
to imply that the shame of being excelled by an infe∣riour
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
Creature is a stronger motive to Virtue than the
most shining Example. When we observe the Dan∣gers
and Mischiefs the same Animals expose them∣selves
to by their Folly and Intemperance, we are
convinced of a very useful Truth, that Misery is the
natural Effect of Vice.</P>
<P>I know there is an ingenious <HI>Gentleman</HI> who is very
angry with the <HI>Water Poets.</HI> He in particular ridicules
<HI>Sannazarius,</HI> and other Authors of <HI>Piscatory Eclogues;</HI>
though that <HI>Writer</HI> gained more Reputation by those
Eclogues than all his other Works. <HI>Rapin</HI> seems to
disapprove of them in general; but the Reasons he
gives are but of little weight. Every one knows that
no Employment has more intervals of Leisure, and
opportunities of Contemplation than that of <HI>Fishing;</HI>
and <HI>Suidas</HI> observes that <HI>Pan</HI> was accounted the com∣mon
God both of Fishers and Shepherds. If the Wa∣ters
contain in them nothing but what is uncomfort∣able
and dreadful, 'tis very strange that <HI>Ovid,</HI> who na∣turally
loved what was soft and agreeable, should ever
have made any Attempt in this kind; and that Mr.
<HI>Waller</HI> should have given us a Specimen of the <HI>Halieu∣tick</HI>
Strain in his <HI>Battle of the summer Islands.</HI> The <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI>
upon the revival of Learning, who perhaps had
even then as nice a Tast as any of our modern Cri∣ticks,
were so fond of the Sea, that they attempted
<HI>Piscatory Plays</HI> with good success, and composed <HI>Dra∣maticks</HI>
Pieces, wherein <HI>Syrens</HI> aud <HI>Tritons</HI> bore the
greatest share. Neither was this any arbitrary Change,
for every one knows that <HI>Theocritus,</HI> who is the Stan∣dard
of <HI>Bucolick</HI> Writing, has given us a <HI>Piscatory Idyl∣lium</HI>
Whoever affirms that there are no beauteous
Images to be drawn from the Waters, and that no∣thing
is to found there but Objects of Dread and
Horrour, was certainly never at Sea but in a Storm.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18"/>
But to return to our Author; the Stile of <HI>Oppian</HI> is
florid and copious, but always pure and unaffected;
his Epithets are proper and expressive, his Metaphors
daring, but always just; as <HI>Bodin</HI> well expresses it, <HI>Ex∣uberat
Oppianus mirâ verborum copiâ, non sine magno splen∣dore
sententiarum.</HI> Our Author has made choice of a
Method peculiar to himself, and very proper for the
Subjects he was about to treat of, in which he is exact
and uniform: his Poems of <HI>Fowling</HI> and <HI>Hunting</HI> were
doubtless formed upon the same Plan with the <HI>Halieu∣ticks.</HI>
But above all <HI>Oppian</HI> is admirable in his <HI>Simili∣tudes;</HI>
no one uses them more frequently, or sets them
off to greater advantage. As <HI>Similitudes</HI> are the most
lively Embellishments, and the strongest colours of
Poetry, so he knew they were absolutely necessary to
adorn a Subject somewhat out of the way, and per∣haps
not so pleasing to common Readers. Though
I own some of his Comparisons seem to be a little far∣fetcht,
and to have in them more of the Quaintness
of the Moderns, than the Simplicity of the Ancients.
From the judicious management of the Whole, the
justness and regularity of his Method, the brightness
and delicacy of his Similitudes, <HI>Scaliger,</HI> and from him
Dr. <HI>Kennet</HI> are very positive that he had read <HI>Virgil,
and had taken care to be largely indebted to him; and</HI> (adds
he)<HI>by not misemploying those treasures he has shown that he
deserved to borrow them.</HI> I do not deny but that it is
probable <HI>Oppian</HI> had read <HI>Virgil;</HI> yet I am loth to do
my Author any injustice, by ascribing his perfections
rather to Imitation than Invention.</P>
<P>Another instance of <HI>Oppian</HI>'s Judgment is, that con∣sidering
himself as a Naturalist as well as a Poet, he
has carefully avoided the Recital of any fabulous Re∣ports;
but on the contrary, has taken notice of, and
refuted many vulgar Errours. Sr. <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> com∣mends
<HI>Oppian</HI> for his strict regard to truth, when the
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Prose-Writers of Natural History are more extravagant
in their Narrations. But for other <HI>Fables</HI> which are
extrinsick to the History of Nature, he has not scru∣pled
to make use of them to embellish the Story, and
releive the Reader with an agreeable Digression; his
Fictions being such as are hardly ever to be met with
in common Authors.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian,</HI> as we have said, having taken all imaginable
care to write something that might last to Posterity,
his Works accordingly met with a very favourable ac∣ceptance
among the Learned. <HI>Eustathius</HI> on <HI>Homer,</HI>
and the <HI>Scholiasts</HI> on <HI>Theocritus, Nicander,</HI> and <HI>Lycophron</HI>
speak of him with esteem, and often quote him as an
Author of worth and credit. As for the treatment
which <HI>Oppian</HI> has met with in these latter Ages, there
have been several Editions of him in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI>
Among the rest <HI>Tzetzes</HI> has paraphrased his <HI>Halieuticks</HI>
in <HI>Greek;</HI> and there is a Translation of them into <HI>Latin</HI>
Verse by <HI>Laurentius Lippius</HI> an Italian, but very in∣elegant
and full of Errours. It cannot be denied that
those, who have been acquainted with more than the
bare Name, or Title Page of our Author, have all
along given him his just praise. The <HI>Elder Scaliger</HI> is
endless in his commendation: he calls <HI>him a divine and
incomparable Poet, one skill'd in all parts of Philosophy, the
most perfect Writer among the Greeks, and the only person
that ever came up to Virgil. His Similitudes</HI> (he observes)
<HI>never want either Beauty or strength; that he describes eve∣ry
thing to the life after the softest and most natural manner.</HI>
Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> (than whom no one was better verst in
polite Literature) does our Author justice in the fol∣lowing
Character. <HI>The Dryness of his Subject, though it
offends some modern French Criticks, yet has not hindred
him from being esteemed by more knowing Judges, as an Au∣thor
little inferiour in Fancy, Art and Language to the
most celebrated Masters in the Grecian Strain. The begin∣ning
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
and ending Strokes of each Poem have something of so
great a Spirit and Turn, as show him to have had a Genius
for much more Heroical Atcheivements in Verse.</HI> Sr. <HI>Tho.
Brown,</HI> though a severe Censor of Authors and Opi∣nions,
and very sparing of his encomiums, cries out
with some indignation, <HI>It is a great wonder that Oppian</HI>'s
<HI>elegant Lines are so much neglected, surely we hereby reject
one of the best Epic Poets.</HI> Indeed I know not how it
happens, that there is scarce any of the <HI>Ancients</HI> that
deserves more, or meets with less Regard.</P>
<P>It was this Motive that invited Mr. <HI>Diaper</HI> to make
an Essay on the two first Books, which contain the <HI>Na∣tural
History of Fishes:</HI> as he had a Wit that was capa∣ble
of shining on any Subject, so his Translation shews
him to have had a peculiar Genius for Natural History.
Where the Images are brighter than ordinary, he has
somewhat paraphrased the Author, but no where, I
believe, deviated from his Sense and Intention. The
Richness of his Fancy and copious Expression maintain
the Character and Spirit of <HI>Oppian,</HI> even while he re∣cedes
from the Letter of the Original. His unfortu∣nate
Death preventing him from finishing his intended
Work, I have attempted a Translation of the three
last Books, which are properly <HI>Halieuticks,</HI> and treat
of the <HI>Art of Fishing.</HI> The Honour I owe the Memo∣ry
of my <HI>Fellow Collegian,</HI> and a Zeal for rescuing
<HI>Oppian</HI> from an undeserved Obscurity will plead my
excuse for the Undertaking, as want of Experience
and Assistance will for the Performance.</P>

Fishes by various Wiles elude their Fates,</L>

<L>Kind Spring attones his Predecessor's Wrong,</L>

<L>Heave-Nets the Fishes oozy Beds explore.</L>
<L>A thousand Names a Fisher might rehearse</L>
<L>That shun untractable the smoother Verse.<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>The Third the mazy Weel's Enclosure bait,</L>

<L>Others the Trident's gastly Terrors wield,</L>
<L>And purple Conquests stain the watry Field.<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L>These various Arms the Fisher's Toils attend,</L>

<HEAD>A
CATALOGUE
OF THE
FISHES
Mention'd in OPPIAN.</HEAD>
<P>AT the distance of fifteen hundred years from
the Time in which <HI>Oppian</HI> wrote, and in a
Country remote from those Seas which were
the Scene of his Poem,'tis but reasonable
that large allowances should be made to a Translator
who is obliged to english the <HI>Greek</HI> names by which
<HI>Fishes</HI> were distinguish'd, as they swam so many Cen∣turies
ago in the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> He that reads the
modern <HI>Ichthyologists</HI> will find them very much divided
in their opinions, and at a loss to determine what
Fishes are meant from the ancient Accounts of 'em;
so that whoever would be exact in adjusting their
Names, must take the pains of comparing them to∣gether,
and not trust to a single Authority.</P>
<P>As for those Fishes which are common to the <HI>British</HI>
and <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and whose Qualities are so re∣markable
that they leave us no room to doubt, such
Names as are already made by other Naturalists as
Mr. <HI>Willoughby, Grew</HI> and <HI>Charleton,</HI> I have not scrupled
to make use of for genuine English. As we have no
proper <HI>English</HI> Words to express the Names of Fishes
<PB N="224" REF="242"/>
unknown to our Seas, I have been sometimes obliged
to retain the Original Word, or to borrow <HI>Italian</HI>
Names when they are more agreeable: some of 'em
I have described by a kind of <HI>Periphrasis,</HI> and ventured
to coin new Terms for others, agreeable to the Ety∣mology
of the <HI>Greek.</HI> Sometimes the different Sexes
and Ages of a known <HI>Species</HI> which have but one <HI>English</HI>
Name, have different ones in the <HI>Greek;</HI> but this De∣fect
is easily supplied by the addition of a proper Epi∣thet.
Several Fishes take their Names from Land-Animals,
on the account of some accidental Mark or
Property, without any Regard to their Shape or spe∣cifick
Nature. For (as Sr. <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> righty ob∣serves)
'tis a vulgar Errour to suppose that there are
Fishes in the Sea analogous to all Creatures on the
Land. In the following Catalogue it would be need∣less
to give any account of Fishes farther than would
be necessary for reading the Author; since so many
Ancients and Moderns have written long Treatises on
this Subject; among the former, <HI>Aristotle, Aelian</HI> and
<HI>Pliny,</HI> of the latter <HI>Aldrovandus, Rondolet, Salvian, Gesner,
Johnston,</HI> and above all Mr. <HI>Willoughby;</HI> who has not
only given a nice and anatomical Description of Fishes,
but also an exact representation of their external Fi∣gures.
In observing the prodigious Variety of their
Shapes, and now excellently the parts of their Bodies
are fitted to the uses which Providence has allotted
them for their preservation, the Curious will find an
agreeable Entertainment, and will at once discover
new Beauties in Nature, and the Descriptions of our
Poet.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian,</HI> in dividing his Fishes with regard only to the
different places of their feeding and usual Resort, in∣tended
only, as it is agreeable to Poetry, first to lay
the Scene before he proceeded to Action. But with
respect to the differences in the Make of their Bodies
and their manner of Generation, Fishes are divided
<PB N="225" REF="243"/>
into <HI>Cetaceous</HI> or <HI>Whale-Fishes, Cartilagineous, Spinosi</HI> or
Fishes with small prickly Bones, and the <HI>Exanguia</HI> or

than Fishes. The two first Kinds are <HI>Vivipa∣rous,</HI>
the two latter <HI>Oviparous.</HI></P>
