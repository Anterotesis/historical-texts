<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Cowley's comedy of <HI>The Belle's Stratagem</HI> was first announced, it occurred to the author of the following drama, that it might be a parody on Farquhar's excellent comedy of <HI>The Beaux Stratagem;</HI> under that idea he went to see it performed: but, instead of a faint copy, found a vivid original.</P>
<P>The suggestion of a parody on Farquhar had, however, so strongly impressed his imagination, that he was compelled to yield to it by producing this; which, having been favourably received nearly twenty nights on the stage, now ventures forth divested of the charms of action. The Reader will, it is presumed and hoped, in idea supply them; or, it must remain a mere dead letter: seeing, with his "mind's eye," the vola∣tile pleasantry of Mr. Bannister, Jun. or, agree∣able freedom of Mr. Fawcett, in <HI>Frank Millclack;</HI> the genteel rusticity of Mr. Barrymore, in 'Squire <HI>Edward;</HI> the skilful junction of bluntness and pa∣thos by Mr. Aickin, in General <HI>Fairlove;</HI> the ab∣solute personification of avarice and cupidity by Mr. Suett, in old <HI>Rackrent;</HI> the becoming mo∣desty of Mr. Benson, in <HI>the player;</HI> the natural humour of Mr. Wewitzer, and irresistible <HI>vis co∣mica</HI> of Mr. Parsons, in the clown <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P>To complete this mental vision must be added, the fascinating vivacity of Mrs. Gibbs, in <HI>Maria;</HI> the unaffected sensibility of Mrs. Powell, and in∣teresting
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>simplicity of Mrs. Kemble, in <HI>Charlotte;</HI> the incessant loquacity of Mrs. Hopkins, in Mrs. <HI>Millclack;</HI> and the unique, most perfect assump∣tion of character, in dress, dialect, and demeanour, exhibited by Mrs. Harlowe, in the country maw∣kin <HI>Dorothy:</HI> all of whom, not forgetting those unmentioned, are justly entitled to, and are here requested to receive, the author's warmest thanks for their several exertions to serve him.</P>
<P>The favour of the Manager's highly-humorous Epilogue, as humorously delivered by Mr. Ban∣nister, Jun. merits, and receives particular ac∣knowledgment. Mr. Barrymore's lively recita∣tion of the Prologue proved him deserving of a better one.</P>
<P>Should any hyper-critic assail the author for his division of the play into four acts, Dr. Blair's <HI>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</HI> must be his shield. "The division of every play, into five acts, has no other foundation than common practice, and the authority of Horace.
<Q><L>Neve minor, neu sit quanto productior actu</L>
<L>Fabula.—</L>
<BIBL>DE ARTE POET.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is a division purely arbitrary. There is no∣thing in the nature of the composition which fixes this number rather than any other; and it had been much better if no such number had been ascertain∣ed, but every play had been allowed to divide it∣self into as many parts, or intervals, as the sub∣ject naturally pointed out."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obtruding a Dedication upon you, however I may offend by the deed itself, I trust I shall not by the contents; which are mere reverbations of the public voice.</P>
<P>THE world has long since styled you, one of the first dramatic writers of the age; your convivial wit, all who have the happiness to join the social board with you are charmed with; the politeness of your manners, and benevolence of your heart, those who derive their subsistence from you unanimously acknowledge; your judgment as a critick, and candour as a friend, I may experi∣mentally pronounce correct and unsullied.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
<P>To such a Patron I am proud to inscribe the following Drama; for your attention to which, and the many other favours you have conferred on both myself and son, I shall ever remain,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, <HI>BY THE AUTHOR.</HI> SPOKEN BY MR. BARRYMORE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HEIGHO FOR A HUSBAND! the title's not bad—</L>
<L>But the piece it precedes, is it merry, or sad?</L>
<L>That remains to be proved—meantime let's descant—</L>
<L>Tho' a saying so trite no explaining can want.—</L>
<L>At boarding-school, Miss, having enter'd her teens,</L>
<L>Soon learns of her elders what soft Heigho! means;</L>
<L>Or, at home with Mama, reading Novels so charming,</L>
<L>Finds her tender Heigho! grow each day more alarming:</L>
<L>E'en Mama, as Miss reads, can't suppress the sweet sigh;</L>
<L>And, were Spousy but dead, would again Heigho! cry.</L>
<L>When mature, the young Lady, if nothing worse chances,</L>
<L>Proclaims Heigho! aloud; and to Gretna Green prances:</L>
<L>The prudish coy Females who thirty attain,</L>
<L>Cry Heigho for a Husband! at length, but in vain;</L>
<L>For the Men say, no, no! and, the down off the peach,</L>
<L>Reject what before they stood tiptoe to reach.</L>
<L>The Widow of Sixty, her seventh mate dead,</L>
<L>Cries Heigho! for an Eighth, with one tooth in her head;</L>
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
<L>A colt's tooth some call it, but I am afraid</L>
<L>The owner's more properly 'titled a jade!</L>
<L>All ranks it pervades too, as well as all ages;</L>
<L>Heigho for a Husband! the Peeress engages:</L>
<L>With four pearls on her coronet in her own right,</L>
<L>The Baroness sighs for five pearls day and night;</L>
<L>O, were she a Countess, how happy her state:</L>
<L>She marries an Earl, and is wretchedly great!</L>
<L>Should an eye to the pocket pollute our soft scenes,</L>
<L>The Author from nature to paint only means:</L>
<L>From nature alone? No! he owns, and with pride,</L>
<L>That Nature and Farquhar him equally guide!</L>
<L>If, therefore, you track him in something well known,</L>
<L>Should he copy with taste, and his prototype own,</L>
<L>No plagiarist deem him, but favour the loan.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, <HI>BY G. COLMAN, JUN. <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR></HI> SPOKEN BY MR. BANNISTER, JUN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE are some husbands here, as I conjecture,</L>
<L>Who, before now, have heard a curtain lecture—</L>
<L>Our curtain drawn, no lecture can be apter</L>
<L>Than one upon the matrimonal chapter.</L>
<L>I'll give you mine in brief—and let you know,</L>
<L>Why spinsters for a Husband cry Heigho!</L>
<L>Why men run mad for wives 'till they have got 'em,</L>
<L>I'll search you all, depend on't, to the bottom.—</L>
<L>How sweetly glide the hours with man and wife!</L>
<L>First, for a trading pair, in lower life.—</L>
<L>When frugal Mrs. Munns, on foggy nights,</L>
<L>One fat and cheerless tallow-candle lights,</L>
<L>When Spouse and she experience, o'er it's gloom,</L>
<L>The stifling transports of the small back-room,</L>
<L>While Dick minds shop—all topicks as they handle,</L>
<L>He smokes—while Dearee darns, and snuffs the candle.</L>
<L>"Lauk! vat a frosty night"—cries she—"I loves</L>
<L>"A frost—ve sells so many fur-skin gloves.—</L>
<L>"For my part," then she darns—"I thinks the tax</L>
<L>"On gloves vas made to break poor people's backs—</L>
<L>"I thinks that ve vere tax'd before enough;</L>
<L>"Vaunt ve?"—Munn's gives a nod—then gives a puff:</L>
<L>"Vell, Christmas vill be here, and then you know,</L>
<L>"Our Jacky comes from school from Prospect-row.</L>
<L>"Ve'll take him to the Children in the Vood,</L>
<L>"Vere Bannister they say's so monstrous good.</L>
<L>"Shan't ve, my lovee?—that ve vill, adod!"</L>
<L>Munns gives another puff—but gives no nod.</L>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>"Lauk, you're so glum—you never speaks, you don't—</L>
<L>"Vy von't you talk a bit?"—"Because I won't."</L>
<L>"You vont?"—"I won't"—"Vy, then, the divil fitch</L>
<L>"Such brutes as you!"—"A brute! a brute you—hum"—</L>
<L>Quit we the vulgar Spouse, whose vulgar mind</L>
<L>Bids him be gross, because he can't be kind,</L>
<L>And seek the Tonish pair, confign'd by fate</L>
<L>To live in all the elegance of hate;</L>
<L>Whose lips a coarse expression ne'er desiles,</L>
<L>Who cut with coolness, and torment in smiles,</L>
<L>Who prove (no rule of etiquette exceeding)</L>
<L>Most perfect loathing, with most perfect breeding.</L>
<L>When chance, for once, forbids my Lord to roam,</L>
<L>And ties him, tête-à-tête, to dine at home,</L>
<L>The clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h remov'd, then comes <HI>ennui,</HI> and hyp,</L>
<L>The wine, his tooth-pick—and her Ladyship!</L>
<L>"Pray, Ma'am"—and then he yawns—"may I require</L>
<L>"When you came home?"—and then he stirs the fire—</L>
<L>"I mean last night!"—"Last night?—as I'm alive</L>
<L>"I scarce remember—O, to-day at five.</L>
<L>"And you?"—"Faith, I forget—Hours are beneath</L>
<L>"My notice, Madam"—then he picks his teeth.</L>
<L>"And pray, my Lord, to-morrow, where d'ye dine?"</L>
<L>"Faith, I can't tell,"—and then he takes his wine.</L>
<L>Thus high and low your Lecturer explores,</L>
<L>One <HI>higher</HI> step remains—and there he soars;</L>
<L>O! would you turn where Hymen's flame divine</L>
<L>In purest ray, and brightest colours shine,</L>
<L>Look on the Throne—For Hymen there is proud,</L>
<L>And waves his torch in triumph o'er the croud;</L>
<L>There Majesty in mildness sits above,</L>
<L>And gives fresh lustre to counubial love!</L>

<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still, Maria, I cannot reconcile my∣self to your being the maid, and I the mistress;— let us change characters.</P>

<P>By no means; you, Charlotte, were born a gentlewoman; I am, at best, but a rich man's daughter.—For this town it must be so.— If we fail here, and you then desire it, I'll "ascend the throne of rule," at the next town we remove to.</P>

<SP>

<P>I have no need of either at present, I thank you, Ma'am; I troubled you only to ask a sew questions about your town, and neighbour hood.—But, first, I believe it will be prudent to speak about dinner; for we have travell'd forty miles since breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your La'yship's perfectly in the right; the air does create an appetite, to be sure; —would you please to have a green goose, or duck and pease? some broil'd chicken and mush∣rooms?—or a—</P>

<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will first trouble you, Ma'am, with the care of my pocket book; there are some bank-notes in it; tho' not of much consequence, yet to a greater amount than I should care to lose; and, as I shall stay here 'till the return of the post from
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>London, it will be safer, perhaps, in your keep∣ing than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be as safe as in the bank, your La'yship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, Ma'am, for a little chit-chat. Pray, what sort of a town is this? are the ladies very handsome, the gentlemen very gallant? have you elegant assemblies, a crowded theatre, and plea∣sant public walks?—are the gentry so polite and conversable as to make one wish to pass a sum∣mer with them?—or, does your beau-monde consist of card-players, scandal-mongers, and de∣tractors; fit only to herd together, without ever being relieved from their spleen by the accidental intervention of an agreeable Londoner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, your La'yship, as to our town, it is but an old cathedral-kind of place; and, for the ladies, I don't think there's so hand∣some a one in it as yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Ma'am!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the gentlemen, if they'd use my house a little more; and, when they do come, call for claret instead of port, I should not like them the worse for it: but, we have a noble assembly-room, at the gable-end of our stables; it's alter'd into a playhouse, at present, for the actors that come here every summer: then, to be sure, we have charming pleasant walks, and—</P>

<P>Not many, your La'yship, tho' there's plenty of 'squires, knights, and barrow-knights; but, the richest he in the county, let the others be what they will, 'squire, knight, or lord, is a miserly justice of peace, hard by; old 'Squire Rackrent; —such a skinflint; and, yet, he has a son, the finest young gentleman! who is as good as he is handsome! has no more pride than a ploughman! takes my son, Frank, a-hunting with him: to be sure, my husband, rest his ashes! was a decay'd gentleman; and, so, Frank's a gentleman born;— as for what I am worth—and he's my only child —but, that's neither here nor there—I was talk∣ing of 'Squire Edward, son to old Splitfarthing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, the one I made free with, does, in some sort, answer your idea; but, the other appears to be what it is very difficult to as∣sume, the woman of fashion; easy without fami∣liarity, elegant without affectation, and beautiful without paint!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a lively rogue, Frank; but, take my word for it, they are no better than I have said; let's talk no more of them.—What shall we do this evening? I am rather in a pensive mood; let's angle an hour or two.—I'll take honest Izaac Walton in my pocket; then there will be three of us—for, compliment apart—though your com∣pany is extremely pleasant and agreeable, Frank, I sometimes wish for more variety; but, my churlish father denies me any other.—Strange! that a man of his fortune should so mope and im∣mure himself and son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed, master Edward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not go out at all, this evening—I am melancholy, Frank! I'll finish reading Hammond's tender elegies, or play some of the divine pieces of Corelli.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you <HI>are</HI> melancholy.—I have per∣ceived it growing on you some time;—and, you don't go the way to be otherwise; for, except a little hunting, you do nothing to exhilarate: nor, has even the chase that effect upon you;—for, tho' you follow it as exercise, when others are halloo∣ing, you are always <HI>sad</HI> at the <HI>death.</HI> Now, one of the girls, I told you of, would make you quite another creature! if they are merely what you sup∣pose, half an hour's flirtation would at least amuse you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Frank, I never delighted in such company.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, 'Squire, should she, who appears a

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>The taylor's a knave, and you're a fool— if he can't darn it, let him patch it; it's only to wear in my own grounds, not to go to court in! Oh, Edward, are you there!—I had forgot—it will serve him, and save me any more expence, as he's so near of age!
<STAGE><HI>(Aside.)</HI></STAGE> You are fond of hunting, Edward, and, as I begrudge you no reasonable diversion—that costs me nothing!
<STAGE><HI>(Aside.)</HI></STAGE> I permit it, but I observ'd t'other day, that the coat you ride in is too good for the purpose.—There's a coat of mine at the taylor's,
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>with only just the nap worn off, will make you an excellent hunting-frock; and you may put the other by for Sundays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am greatly obliged to you, but the clothes I have will serve me very will till I am of age; when my late uncle's liberality will prevent my being any longer troublesome to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you had need to have your uncle's estate, Edward, for you take after him exactly. I remember, in particular, your uncle was very fond of finery.—Upon my going once to see him in Lon∣don, he said he wonder'd that I would appear in so shabby a suit of clothes!—Lord, brother, says I, what signifies how I am drest? nobody knows me here!—and, on his visiting me soon after in the country, he express'd the like surprise at my being (as he phrased it) so meanly apparell'd! but I re∣plied partly as before;—what signifies how I am drest?—every body knows me here!—so, Edward, between every body and nobody, I make any coat serve, and keep my money in my pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>An admirable reply, indeed, Sir!— how I admire your Worship's wisdom and occonomy!</P>
</SP>

<P>Did your honour please to call?</P>

<P>Yes, Dorothy; my friend, Frank, has been telling me, that there is a lady of fashion, and a genteel young woman, her companion, just arriv'd from London, at his house; who mean to stay two or three days; now, as we live so far from the metropolis, and my father keeps no company, I think, Dorothy, you should avail yourself of such a circumstance; and get Mrs. Millclack to pre∣sent your compliments to the Lady's attendant, and, if she has leisure, request the favour of her company to drink tea with you this afternoon; by which means you'll learn the London modes, and
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>the Tôn, as they call it: and by making a proper use of this and other such opportunities, in case of my father's death, or my marriage, qualify yourself for a better situation in more fashionable families.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, how do you find your∣self by this time, are you tired of the frolic, and inclined to return to London; or, as we have rush'd into the middle of the stream at once, shall we boldly proceed? since, to return is worse, I fear, than going on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, my dear Maria! I have very little inclination to return; for, to continue the meta∣phor, we might not regain footing on the shore we have left; and yet, without rudder or compass, how, or which way to sleer, I am utterly igno∣rant.</P>

<P>I think we have, Madam; and this gentleman in particular, who has quitted (perhaps imprudently) one of the liberal professions for that of a player, is allowed to be a very excellent actor.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLAYER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should blush, Sir, at what you are pleased to say of me; but that, as an alloy to your unmerited compliment, you advert to the <HI>lib ra!</HI> profession I quitted; that it is highly respectable, the epithet bestowed on it is a proof; but, considered
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>candidly, what profession is more liberal than that of "the well-trod stage!"
<Q><L>"<HI>If</HI> Jonson's <HI>learned Sock be on,</HI></L>

<P>Well, faith, your young lady is ex∣tremely good, and immensely handsome? or the beams of benevolence make her appear so.—Were I not irrecoverably in love with you, Maria, I be∣lieve I should be impudent enough to adore her; but I am so dazzled with the sun-shine of your bright eyes, that I am blind as a beetle to the lustre of any other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you'll soon recover your sight, I warrant! the dazzling sun-shine of my eyes will be no sooner withdrawn, than you'll see elegance

<P>Well, upon my word, you are a bold man, to offer marriage to a girl you know nothing of; and never saw till within these two hours.</P>

<P>Marriage!</P>

<P>Aye—did not you say you liked me for what your father liked your mother for? mean∣ing, I suppose, a wife; as I presume, Mr. Fran∣cis, you were born in wedlock.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I vow to Venus you gave them to me! and against my will too.</P>
</SP>

<P>A message to me, Ma'am?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to you; only think, my dear, how civil our town's-folk are to you Londoners; here have you been in the house but an hour or two, and the arrival of a lady of quality, and her attendant, being buzzed about, an invitation is already sent you, to drink tea with Justice Rack∣rent's housekeeper this afternoon; her ladyship will be invited by all our gentry soon, I war∣rant.</P>

<P>Bless me, Ma'am, you don't say so?
<PB N="22" REF="32"/>I am exceedingly obliged to her—and, indeed, I am quite asham'd of your son's behaviour; but I hope, Ma'am, you won't think the worse of me for it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, not at all, child! I have no notion of a squeamish piece of mock-modesty. I don't mean, tho', that I'd have you be naughty; —no, no, child! heaven forbid!—but, "better give a fool a kiss than be troubled with him," was always my maxim.—But, what answer shall I send to the justice's? his man, Timothy, waits with∣out.</P>

<P>Hush!
<STAGE><HI>(aside to Char.)</HI></STAGE> O, Ma'am, the gentlewoman of the house, here, has been kind enough to bring me an invitation, to drink tea, this afternoon, with Justice Rackrent's house∣keeper the old gentleman, whose son she prais'd so, before dinner;) and, if you have no particular commands for an hour or so, I would beg leave, Ma'am, to accept the invitation.
<STAGE><HI>(aside to Char.)</HI></STAGE> Bid me go, by all means!</P>

<P>Why, you know, Maria, I am going to the play this evening; however, be sure to return time enough to help me dress, and—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, your La'yship! you are vast∣ly well as you are; that riding-dress becomes you mightily! and, travellers are not expected to be drawn forth in their best bib and tucker, like the town's folk.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, I'll think of that.—You may go, Maria.</P>

<SP>

<P>What can be the meaning of this odd invitation, Maria? and, why were you so anxious to accept it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my sweet girl! I'll lay my life, the young 'squire has either heard of, or seen you; and this is the casual counterpart of Scrub's invi∣tation to Archer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! but go, my dear Maria? and, should it be as you suspect, improve this opportunity to the utmost, I conjure you!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me! if you are not mar∣ried, and myself too, within a week; ay, and to advantage; may I die an old maid, and be buried with my face downward!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn which way I will, 'tis a most de∣lightful scene!—Thus retired, let me reflect a little upon the project I am engaged in; but, will it bear reflection?—I fear not!—A young un∣thinking female, of family, and, not long since, of fortune, having lost her parents and her patri∣mony, quits the protection of her remaining friends in London; and, accompanied by another girl, more thoughtless than herself, traverses the country, fortune-hunting: that is, with a pre∣determinate design to rob any young man, with simplicity and wealth, of half his riches, and, perchance, all his future happiness. Despicable
<PB N="32" REF="42"/>scheme! and can I, thus reflecting on its baseness, persevere in it?—Oh, Charlotte! if thou can'st, thy parent, fortune, honour, were at once en∣gulph'd! and nothing hath escap'd but this frail, shatter'd wreck; in which, nor worth, nor safety can be found!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> EDWARD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be she! there is a symmetry in that shape, an elegance in that deportment, which none but the charmer decribed to me can possess! —If her manners and sentiments accord but with her form—if?—they must! I am sure they do.— How shall I accost her? I am so mere a novice, that, should I, when I behold her beauty, love her, I fear I shall not dare to tell her so! Ha! yonder, I think,'s our Timothy;—a thought occurs may probably—yet, 'tis ridiculous! and may expose me to contempt! but, I'll venture.— Timothy!
<STAGE><HI>(calling him.)</HI></STAGE>— Yes, he shall change clothes with me;—then, as a simple peasant, I may observe her nearer: and, perhaps, obtain that knowledge of her mind and manners, my proper garb and character might keep me long a stranger to.—Ho! Timothy!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> TIMOTHY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you call me, Measter Yedward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Timothy; did you meet Frank Mill∣clack that way lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Noa, Measter Yedward; but I met a main pratty thing that way, but now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>A main pretty thing! What's it like, Timothy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when first I saw its jacket, I thought it like a man; and when I look'd down at it's petticoat, I thought it like woman; but
<PB N="33" REF="43"/>when I look'd up in it's face, I thought it the most like an angel of any thing I e'er com'd nigh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I understand you;—you mean a lady in a riding-dress, who pass'd that way just now:— upon my word, Timothy, you have described her in a very gallânt manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Anan?—a galant leady! what's that, Measter Yedward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! no matter;—I wanted you about something else.—Frank and I are going a-fishing, perhaps I may have occasion to ford the stream during our sport;—I forgot to put on my fishing-frock, and have not time to go home for it;— prithee, lend me your cloaths, Timothy, and put on mine the while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Measter Yedward, that I will.—I'd change cloaths with you for good and all, if you desired it, thof mine were the better of the two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Timothy! step behind these trees, then, lest somebody shou'd pass by, and we'll do it in a trice; make haste; I expect Frank every minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, are you certain sure, Measter Yed∣ward it was only a leady I met?—it look'd woun∣dedly like an angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Timothy, I am not quite certain; —I only saw her back, and she appear'd but a lady: when I see her face, it is not impossible that I shall think her an angel too!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exeunt.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FRANK <HI>and</HI> MARIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, if this is the grove my lady is walking in, why don't you go some other way? there are pleasant meadows yonder, where they are hay-making; let us walk there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear girl, so will;—but, we
<PB N="34" REF="44"/>are obliged to cross the end of the grove to get at the meadows; we shall come to the haycocks pre∣sently; and will tumble 'em rarely, I warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The haycocks! what does the fool mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to finish the game o'romps my mother interrupted, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you will not, believe me! To be plain, Master Francis, you are a lively, agreeable young fellow, I confess; you have said that you like me; and I make no scruple to own that I like you: but, tho' I am only a servant, and you are heir, as your mother intimates, to something considerable, notwithstanding the freedom I have thus far permitted you, these are maxims I never shall depart from;—no, parson, no passion!—no ring, no romping! and, now I perceive your drift, Sir, no marriage, no meadows!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would you really persuade me, Maria, to marry you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed, Sir!—my tongue shall never persuade to what your heart does not incite you!—but, I am young, some say pretty, virtu∣ous, good-temper'd, and industrious; if these are not qualities estimable enough to entitle me to be an inn-keeper's wife, you may look farther and fare worse!—I have no money, I grant;—that is, only a trifle saved in service, not worth mention∣ing; you have a good deal, and that's the same thing: for, if one of us have it, no matter which; but that it gives the possessor the delight of be∣stowing!—and, could we change conditions, I honestly assure you, the paltry consideration of a little cash should not prevent my saying to you, I, Maria, take thee, Francis! for better for worse, for rich or for poor: I have enough, and the richest have no more!</P>
</SP>
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, Maria, you almost pose me!— I—I don't know what to say: that I like, nay love you, is positive;—but, marriage is such a plaguy old-fashion'd—. Zounds, who have we here?—some of old Rackrent's people; this way, my dear girl, to the meadows, and there we'll talk farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! I have chang'd my mind about walking at all, now; my lady will want to dress for the play: so, you may go to the meadows, and tumble the haycocks by yourself; and I wish you much sport, Mr. Francis!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plague o' this girl! I don't know what to make of her! but this I know; that, tho' I like her exceedingly, of all my mad frolicks, ma∣trimony shall be the last!—Tumble the haycocks by myself? Yes, that's pretty sport to be sure!</P>

<P>Ha! ha! ha!—never stir Measter Yed∣ward, if I can help laughing, to see you so trans∣mogrified!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I can't help admiring how smart and genteel you look, Timothy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I, Measter Yedward?—waundlikins! I am glad of it; I have wanted to look smeart and jonteel ever since I fall'd in love with our Dorothy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure if she saw you in that dress, Timothy, she could not resist you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so, Measter Yedward?— then if I don't go hoame, and fall a courting her directly, may I never be drest out again as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so, Timothy; and call, in your way,
<PB N="36" REF="46"/>at the hair-dresser's; bid him be sure to send within this half-hour to dress me for the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>This half-hour! why, you can't have fish'd much by then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter; go, and do as I bid you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wull, Sir, I wull.—Ha! ha! ha!—the play, quotha! ecod, in my mind, you look like one of the shew-folks, when they be disguised, yourself; you be so waundily transmogrified! ha! ha! ha!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now to overtake the object of my pursuit!—But, stay—somebody is just come out of the hazle-copse, she went toward, and is turning this way,—'tis herself!—now to adapt my manners to my dress.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Saunters about, and whistles.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Re-enter</HI> CHARLOTTE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it shall be so; I'll return to-morrow: —make the most prudent use of what money I shall have left—and, tho' my future life be e'er so mean, it shall not be dishonest! But, whither have I wander'd? 'tis time I shou'd return;—Maria will be at the inn before me, and wonder at my absence:—which is the way?—I think I pass'd thro' this part of the grove before.—I'll enquire of this countryman.—Pray, honest friend, be so good to inform a stranger, which path leads to the post-house in the town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>(aside.)</HI></STAGE> A wonder!—An't please you, Madam, there be two or three ways to it;—but, if you want a letter fetch'd or carried, I'll do it with the utmost pleasure;—for, you look like a sweet lady, whom I shou'd be proud to serve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your civility, friend; but I have no occasion to give you any such trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trouble, Madam! I am sure it could be
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>no trouble to serve you!—I shou'd think it the greatest happiness in the world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very good! There is something uncommonly gentle in the manners of this rustic.
<STAGE><HI>(aside)</HI></STAGE> Pray, do you live hereabout?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, just hard by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>An honest farmer, Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>A farmer! and so young?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; my father died about a year ago; and, as our landlord offer'd for me to keep the farm, I thought I might as well work on it for myself, as for any other: so I became tenant to justice Rackrent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Justice Rackrent? I have heard of him, and his son; they say he is a most amiable young gentleman, and his father quite the reverse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are none of us so good as we should be, Madam; but, extremes in describing folk are seldom just: the old gentleman may be too much dispraised, and the young one too much com∣mended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Engaging candour! he's very person∣able! and, for his condition, unusually intelli∣gent! how happy may the female be who shares his humble lot!
<STAGE><HI>(aside)</HI></STAGE> Are you married, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, nor do I think I ever shall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I never saw but one whom I could love, and her I am unworthy of!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, surely!—There is something in this youth affects me strangely! the more I look on him, the more he strikes me; a hopeless lover, and so handsome! I pity him!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I be of any service to you, Lady?</P>
</SP>
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No other, gentle friend! than to direct me the nearest way to the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Please to keep strait on, till you come to yonder elms; then turn down the woodbine∣walk, and you can't miss your way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, friend!—will you accept this trifle for your pains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, I give you thanks! I have enough, with honest industry;—the pleasure of serving you is sufficient recompence for any pains!</P>

<P><STAGE><HI>(aside.)</HI></STAGE> Heigho! what can this flutter mean!
<STAGE><HI>(puts her hand to her breast.)</HI></STAGE> I never yet felt love!—sure, now I don't!—Since you decline the money, pray, oblige me by accepting this ring, of little value;—only, it may serve as a memorial of one who wish'd you well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your gift, but more for your good wishes, Madam; I'll wear it, and re∣member you unto my latest breath.</P>

<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Angelic creature! complexion, feature, form, grace, speech, perfect all! with such com∣placency to one she thought so low!—O, Love! I have heard and read of thy great power, but knew it not before! She has taken full possession of my soul, and I have now no thought but how to gain her! She's going to the play; I'll home and dress—sit near her there; speak to her, if I dare; attend her, wooe her;—and, if I gain her not—but, let me not suppose it—no! she must, she shall be mine!—</P>

<P>Lord, Timothy! I ne'er know'd you talk so fine before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, noa; because I were never drest so fine before; fine cloaths be half-in-half to meake love in: and I be resolved to meake love wi' might and main, while I ha' these garments on.—When Measter Yedward comes hoame, and I be forced to d'off my finery, mayhap I shan't have a word to throw at a dog; so now, Dolly, don't stand haggling about the bargain; but, if so be as how I ha' won your heart, tell me so flat and plain.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CHARLOTTE, <HI>and</HI> MARIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU cannot, sure, be serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never was more so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>In love with him?—what, a peasant! a clown!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Maria, he's no clown! his man∣ners are as gentle, his ideas as refined, nay, more so, perhaps, than those of many who were bred in the centre of urbanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Childish, circulating-library, com∣mon-place nonsense! gentility and refinement in a bumpkin with clouted shoes?—this exceeds the most romantic of all romances; this is "a squire of low degree" with a vengeance! I thought my∣self sufficiently blameable in giving encourage∣ment, as I told you, to the young fellow, Francis; who is not only intelligent and agreeable, but, as old Sterling says, has "the stuff" too.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Maria, I begin to fear I have been deceived in, and misled by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And indeed, Charlotte, I find I have been sadly deceived in you! I am content with
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>my rattle-cap, Frank, if I can get him, because I am only in the character of a servant; but, should we both miss our aim here, and I assume the <HI>lady</HI> at the next town, mark my words; if I don't marry the richest, and, perhaps, most noble on the spot, say, I am as unfit for our expedition as I now begin to think you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Maria! I have reflected on the impropriety, nay, dishonesty of our plan; and cannot prosecute it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should have consider'd that be∣fore we left London, Madam! nor can you now relinquish it, without injuring me as well as your∣self: I, therefore, expect, for the present, a due observance of our contract; if we fail here, we'll either pursue our joint, original plan, elsewhere, or, I will continue it alone: leaving you to your Arcadian scheme of happiness;—your paragon∣peasant! and the delights of love in a clay-cot∣tage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your vivacity, Maria, puts a gloss upon villainy, and throws contempt and ridicule on the purest virtue and affection! yet, cannot you be serious for a moment, and consider?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And cannot you be gay for a moment? and consider that, unless you make haste, you'll be too late for the play!—so pr'ythee, my dear, no more of this squeamishness; but prepare to be adored by all the young heirs in the neighbour-hood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had much rather not go; pray, Maria, excuse me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's impossible! go, you must; for, Frank tells me, young Rackrent's to be there; he's a pretty young fellow, I promise you; and, I am convinced, has heard of, and longs to see you: he's very rich too! and, if you play your cards
<PB N="46" REF="56"/>right, may prove as advantageous a husband as the first peer in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Maria, I remember the adage— "there is honour among thieves;"—therefore, as I would not be thought deficient in a quality the highest glory in, and the very lowest affect, I'll keep my word as far as honestly I can, and go with you to the play; but, not with a view to gain young Rackrent, or any one my heart cannot ap∣prove! for, tho' I do not think it likely I shall ever have the choice, I here declare, I would pre∣fer the youth I saw just now, and a life of toil, (ay, laugh if you please) to all the ease and gran∣deur, I might derive from a marriage with the most opulent, or noble!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! you are wrong, my dear Charlotte, you are certainly in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Maria! in this I can't be wrong! They who are deliberately, and habitually wicked, are absolutely so:—whilst those who, through want of thought, or from a sudden impulse of pas∣sion, blindly rush into error, are, in some degree excuseable; and their return to rectitude is a pro∣pitiation equally acceptable to Heaven and man!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a power, your honour! of all sorts and sizes! it being such a charming fine day, I sat at the door an hour or two, and saw more go by than I can well remember.</P>

<P>Well, those you <HI>can</HI> remember; what corps did they belong to?—Come, describe their uniforms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your honour, I don't think they were at all uniform; for, first and fore∣most, there pass'd by a fine, tall, handsome serjeant, with four or five tag-rag recruits, a corporal, and drummer; a string of Irish hay-makers, and the little Welsh attorney.</P>

<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn these professional phrases; they make blockheads appear wise, and men of sense fools! why, Madam, to speak in terms more level to your apprehension; I believe you have describ∣ed the identical persons I am in pursuit of: two young women, one of them appearing, no doubt, like a lady; the other, as you observed, may seem to be only her woman.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>RACK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, I say!—I have also heard of your being the champion of this para∣mount-puppet! as a punishment for which, I here declare, and I desire all parties present to take notice of it, that I disinherit you! I'll cut you off with a shilling, sirrah! and, that I may be sure you will have no more, I'll sell my estates; and, when I die, be buried ten fathom under ground, and have all my money buried along with me!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>

<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten fathom under ground!—egad, if you are buried twenty, I believe, Beelzebub will find you out.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Madam! you hear the determi∣nation of your protector's father:—now, will you prefer love and poverty with him, or ease and affluence with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I cannot conceive on what pre∣tence you ground your insolence; and, as no one
<PB N="57" REF="67"/>living can have a right to controul, or detain me, I beg I may be permitted to leave this place, without farther molestation.
<STAGE><HI>(Going.)</HI></STAGE> Come, Maria!</P>

<P>Stay, Charlotte!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha!—he knows my name!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my sword, honour, and affection! I believe I have been so eager to recover my dear child, that I have not had thought enough to tell her, what I am certain she could not know un∣told; and, instead of flying to the arms of her fond, anxious father, perhaps she has mistaken me for a troublesome, ridiculous, old lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What said you, Sir?—father!—can my father be alive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, my sweet girl! I am he! Gene∣ral Fairlove, your doating, happy father!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I no sooner arrived in London, than I was told, that you had read in the public prints, an account of the ship I came home in being lost; and, being also inform'd of your abrupt depar∣ture, having traced you to the inn you set out from, I instantly pursued, and have, here, hap∣pily regain'd my darling child, my Charlotte!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! this is not a place wherein I can properly express my filial feelings! but, for∣give me, I beseech you, Sir, that so many years absence, with the belief that you were dead, should have made me not recognize my ever∣honour'd parent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not have known you, dear! when I accosted you so inconsiderately at the
<PB N="58" REF="68"/>play, if circumstances had not assured me, that you were my own Charlotte Fairlove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, now the murder's out, Dorothy! the leady's no spy! I see plain enough; and, I suppose, your noble honour, I may let her go a∣bout her business?</P>

<P>You may, honest friend, with that for your pains.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Gives him money.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank your right honourable worship, kindly!—Well, Dolly, ben't I a pure fellow, now! and didn't I bluster bravely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that you did, Timothy! and, thof I say it to your face, I ha' see'd many an over∣seer, and churchwarden, when they were bul∣locking of the poor, not look half so big.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your goodness, Sir, emboldens me to beg, that, however you may have reason to chide me for my late precipitate flight; as it has been productive of an unhappy breach between this young gentleman and his father, you will gra∣ciously consider him as the innocent victim of love and accident.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE><HI>(aside.)</HI></STAGE> Generous creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, my child!—and, as I perceive your reciprocal affection, if your hand and fortune will atone for the loss of his father's favour, he may command them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I know not how to thank you for your noble offer! and will my charmer deign to ratify such bounty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>More willingly than ever wretch ex∣changed her misery for bliss!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have been silent spectators hither∣to, gentlefolks, as became us; but, now that one match is so happily concluded, I believe, with my mother's leave, another may be made up! and in fewer words.—What say you, Maria?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="59" REF="69"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hardly a word at all.—Come, Maria! we have spoke plain English to one ano∣ther, hitherto; don't let us go about the bush now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, thus it is—You have made pretty free with my lips, Frank; and, if I may judge by your present offer, are not displeased with the sample: here I am, just what I told you in the grove; honest, but poor: now, take me, or leave me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you, mother? she's a clever wench, saith! let me have her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> MILL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And welcome, Frank!—she's a good girl, I believe, tho' frolicksome;—I'll give you a thousand pounds to begin the world with, and leave you five times as much when I die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, landlady; and, to convince you that you have not done amiss; her father, having repented his late harshness, authorised me to assure her of his concurrence in whomsoever should be her choice; adding, that they shall libe∣rally partake of while he lives, and, at his death, inherit his entire property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, good, little old dad!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Maria, this may alter your mind?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Frank!—I like you!—and will make you as good a wife, as if I had not brought you a penny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so, my girl!—why then, hey for Hymen! and, farewel inn-keeping! we'll now turn gentry, mother; and you shall also shortly turn—</P>

<P>Well said, young man! and, to keep you in countenance, old lady, my son-in-law looks a promise, as shortly to make me a grandfather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>My present happiness, Sir, is so com∣plete, that it were avarice of bliss to think of fu∣ture felicity!—possest of my charmer's hand and heart, tho' blessings may be multiplied, the trans∣port of this moment can never be exceeded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Saving your honours' presence, Dorothy and I be going to make a match on't too; and we'll do our best not to be behind hand with you.</P>

<P>Yes, your honours;—I'se always do my best; and be buxom at bed and board, as a good wife ought to be!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another happy-couple! well said! egad, I believe this is Valentine's day, for all the birds are pairing!—May we be loving as sparrows, cheer∣ful as linnets, and constant as turtle-doves; and may the cuckoo's note, "unpleasing to the mar∣ried ear,"—be never heard by us, but as the har∣binger of Spring.</P>
