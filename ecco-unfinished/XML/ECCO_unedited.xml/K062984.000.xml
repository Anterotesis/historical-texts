<Q><L>—A manly race</L>
<L>Of unsubmitting spirit, wife and brave;</L>
<L>Who still thro' bleeding ages struggled hard</L>

<L>Too much in vain!</L></Q>
<BIBL>THOMSON.</BIBL>
<LG>
<L>HAIL generous CORSICA! unconquer'd isle!</L>
<L>The fort of freedom; that amidst the waves</L>
<L>Stands like a rock of adamant, and dares</L>
<L>The wildest fury of the beating storm.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<L>And are there yet, in this late sickly age</L>
<L>(Unkindly to the tow'ring growths of virtue)</L>
<L>Such bold exalted spirits? Men whose deeds,</L>
<L>To the bright annals of old GREECE oppos'd,</L>
<L>Would throw in shades her yet unrival'd name,</L>
<L>And dim the lustre of her fairest page.</L>
<L>And glows the flame of LIBERTY so strong</L>
<L>In this lone speck of earth! this spot obscure,</L>
<L>Shaggy with woods, and crusted o'er with rock,</L>
<L>By slaves surrounded and by slaves oppress'd!</L>
<L>What then should BRITONS feel? should they not catch</L>
<L>The warm contagion of heroic ardour,</L>
<L>And kindle at a fire so like their own?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such were the working thoughts which swell'd the breast</L>
<L>Of generous BOSWEL; when with nobler aim</L>
<L>And views beyond the narrow beaten track</L>
<L>By trivial fancy trod, he turn'd his course</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
From polish'd Gallia's soft delicious vales,</L>
<L>From the grey reliques of imperial Rome,</L>
<L>From her long galleries of laurel'd stone,</L>
<L>Her chisel'd heroes, and her marble gods,</L>
<L>Whose dumb majestic pomp yet awes the world,</L>
<L>To animated forms of patriot zeal,</L>
<L>Warm in the living majesty of virtue,</L>
<L>Elate with fearless spirit, firm, resolv'd,</L>
<L>By fortune unsubdued, unaw'd by power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How raptur'd fancy burns, while warm in thought</L>
<L>I trace the pictur'd landscape; while I kiss</L>
<L>With pilgrim lips devout the sacred soil</L>
<L>Stain'd with the blood of heroes. CYRNUS, hail!</L>
<L>Hail to thy rocky, deep indented shores,</L>
<L>And pointed cliffs, which hear the chafing deep</L>
<L>Incessant foaming round their shaggy sides:</L>
<L>Hail to thy winding bays, thy shelt'ring ports</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
And ample harbours, which inviting stretch</L>
<L>Their hospitable arms to every sail:</L>
<L>Thy numerous streams, that bursting from the cliffs</L>
<L>Down the steep channel'd rock impetuous pour</L>
<L>With grateful murmur: on the fearful edge</L>
<L>Of the rude precipice, thy hamlets brown</L>
<L>And straw-roof'd cots, which from the level vale</L>
<L>Scarce seen, amongst the craggy hanging cliffs</L>
<L>Seem like an eagle's nest aerial built:</L>
<L>Thy swelling mountains, brown with solemn shade</L>
<L>Of various trees, that wave their giant arms</L>
<L>O'er the rough sons of freedom; lofty pines,</L>
<L>And hardy fir, and ilex ever green,</L>
<L>And spreading chesnut, with each humbler plant,</L>
<L>And shrub of fragrant leaf, that clothes their sides</L>
<L>With living verdure; whence the clust'ring bee</L>
<L>Extracts her golden dews: the shining box,</L>
<L>And sweet-leav'd myrtle, aromatic thyme,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
The prickly juniper, and the green leaf</L>
<L>Which feeds the spinning worm; while glowing bright</L>
<L>Beneath the various foliage, wildly spreads</L>
<L>The arbutus, and rears his scarlet fruit</L>
<L>Luxuriant, mantling o'er the craggy steeps;</L>
<L>And thy own native laurel crowns the scene.</L>
<L>Hail to thy savage forests, awful, deep:</L>
<L>Thy tangled thickets, and thy crowded woods,</L>
<L>The haunt of herds untam'd; which sullen bound</L>
<L>From rock to rock with fierce unsocial air</L>
<L>And wilder gaze, as conscious of the power</L>
<L>That loves to reign amid the lonely scenes</L>
<L>Of unbroke nature: precipices huge,</L>
<L>And tumbling torrents; trackless desarts, plains</L>
<L>Fenc'd in with guardian rocks, whose quarries teem</L>
<L>With shining steel, that to the cultur'd fields</L>
<L>And sunny hills which wave with bearded grain</L>
<L>Defends their homely produce. LIBERTY,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
The mountain goddess, loves to range at large</L>
<L>Amidst such scenes, and on the iron soil</L>
<L>Prints her majestic step: for these she scorns</L>
<L>The green enamel'd vales, the velvet lap</L>
<L>Of smooth savannahs, where the pillow'd head</L>
<L>Of luxury reposes; balmy gales,</L>
<L>And bowers that breathe of bliss: for these, when first</L>
<L>This isle emerging like a beauteous gem</L>
<L>From the dark bosom of the Tyrrhene main</L>
<L>Rear'd its fair front, she mark'd it for her own,</L>
<L>And with her spirit warm'd: her genuine sons,</L>
<L>A broken remnant, from the generous stock</L>
<L>Of ancient Greece, from Sparta's sad remains,</L>
<L>True to their high descent, preserv'd unquench'd</L>
<L>The sacred fire thro' many a barbarous age:</L>
<L>Whom, nor the iron rod of cruel Carthage,</L>
<L>Nor the dread sceptre of imperial Rome,</L>
<L>Nor bloody Goth, nor grisly Saracen,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
Nor the long galling yoke of proud Liguria,</L>
<L>Could crush into subjection. Still unquell'd</L>
<L>They rose superior, bursting from their chains</L>
<L>And claim'd man's dearest birthright, LIBERTY:</L>
<L>And long, thro' many a hard unequal strife</L>
<L>Maintain'd the glorious conflict; long withstood</L>
<L>With single arm, the whole collected force</L>
<L>Of haughty Genoa, and ambitious Gaul:</L>
<L>And shall withstand it, trust the faithful Muse.</L>
<L>It is not in the force of mortal arm,</L>
<L>Scarcely in fate, to bind the struggling soul</L>
<L>That gall'd by wanton power, indignant swells</L>
<L>Against oppression; breathing great revenge,</L>
<L>Careless of life, determin'd to be free.</L>
<L>And fav'ring heaven approves: for see the Man,</L>
<L>Born to exalt his own, and give mankind</L>
<L>A glimpse of higher natures: just, as great;</L>
<L>The soul of counsel, and the nerve of war;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="12" MS="y"/>
Of high unshaken spirit, temper'd sweet</L>
<L>With soft urbanity, and polish'd grace,</L>
<L>And attic wit, and gay unstudied smiles:</L>
<L>Whom heaven in some propitious hour endow'd</L>
<L>With every purer virtue: gave him all</L>
<L>That lifts the hero, or adorns the man.</L>
<L>Gave him the eye sublime; the searching glance</L>
<L>Keen, scanning deep, that smites the guilty soul</L>
<L>As with a beam from heaven; on his brow</L>
<L>Serene, and spacious front, set the broad seal</L>
<L>Of dignity and rule; then smil'd benign</L>
<L>On this fair pattern of a God below,</L>
<L>High wrought, and breath'd into his swelling breast</L>
<L>The large ambitious wish to save his country.</L>
<L>Oh beauteous title to immortal fame!</L>
<L>The man devoted to the public, stands</L>
<L>In the bright records of superior worth</L>
<L>A step below the skies: if he succeed,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
The first fair lot which earth affords, is his;</L>
<L>And if he falls, he falls above a throne.</L>
<L>When such their leader can the brave despair?</L>
<L>Freedom the cause and PAOLI the chief.</L>
<L>Success to your fair hopes! a British muse,</L>
<L>Tho' weak and powerless, lifts her servent voice,</L>
<L>And breathes a prayer for your success. Oh could</L>
<L>She scatter blessings as the morn sheds dews,</L>
<L>To drop upon your heads! but patient hope</L>
<L>Must wait the appointed hour; secure of this,</L>
<L>That never with the indolent and weak</L>
<L>Will freedom deign to dwell; she must be seiz'd</L>
<L>By that bold arm that wrestles for the blessing:</L>
<L>'Tis heaven's best gift and must be bought with blood.</L>
<L>When the storm thickens, when the combat burns,</L>
<L>And pain and death in every horrid shape</L>
<L>That can appall the feeble, prowl around,</L>
<L>Then virtue triumphs; then her tow'ring form</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="14"/>
Dilates with kindling majesty; her mien</L>
<L>Breathes a diviner spirit, and enlarg'd</L>
<L>Each spreading feature, with an ampler port</L>
<L>And bolder tone, exulting, rides the storm,</L>
<L>And joys amidst the tempest: then she reaps</L>
<L>Her golden harvest; fruits of nobler growth</L>
<L>And higher relish than meridian suns</L>
<L>Can ever ripen; fair, heroic deeds,</L>
<L>And godlike action. 'Tis not meats, and drinks,</L>
<L>And balmy airs, and vernal suns, and showers</L>
<L>That feed and ripen minds; 'tis toil and danger;</L>
<L>And wrestling with the stubborn gripe of fate;</L>
<L>And war, and sharp distress, and paths obscure</L>
<L>And dubious. The bold swimmer joys not so</L>
<L>To feel the proud waves under him, and beat</L>
<L>With strong repelling arm the billowy surge;</L>
<L>The generous courser does not so exult</L>
<L>To toss his floating mane against the wind,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="15"/>
And neigh amidst the thunder of the war,</L>
<L>As virtue to oppose her swelling breast</L>
<L>Like a firm shield against the darts of fate.</L>
<L>And when her sons in that rough school have learn'd</L>
<L>To smile at danger, then the hand that rais'd</L>
<L>Shall hush the storm, and lead the shining train</L>
<L>Of peaceful years in bright procession on.</L>
<L>Then shall the shepherd's pipe, the muse's lyre,</L>
<L>On CYRNUS' shores be heard: her grateful sons</L>
<L>With loud acclaim and hymns of cordial praise</L>
<L>Shall hail their high deliverers; every name</L>
<L>To virtue dear be from oblivion snatch'd,</L>
<L>And plac'd among the stars: but chiefly thine,</L>
<L>Thine, PAOLI, with sweetest sound shall dwell</L>
<L>On their applauding lips; thy sacred name,</L>
<L>Endear'd to long posterity, some muse,</L>
<L>More worthy of the theme, shall consecrate</L>
<L>To after ages, and applauding worlds</L>
<L>Shall bless the godlike man who sav'd his country.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<L>So vainly wish'd, so fondly hop'd the Muse:</L>
<L>Too fondly hop'd: The iron fates prevail,</L>
<L>And CYRNUS is no more. Her generous sons,</L>
<L>Less vanquish'd than o'erwhelm'd, by numbers crush'd,</L>
<L>Admir'd, unaided fell. So strives the moon</L>
<L>In dubious battle with the gathering clouds,</L>
<L>And strikes a splendour thro' them: till at length</L>
<L>Storms roll'd on storms involve the face of heaven</L>
<L>And quench her struggling fires. Forgive the zeal</L>
<L>That, too presumptuous, whisper'd better things</L>
<L>And read the book of destiny amiss.</L>
<L>Not with the purple colouring of success</L>
<L>Is virtue best adorn'd: th' attempt is praise.</L>
<L>There yet remains a freedom, nobler far</L>
<L>Than kings or senates can destroy or give;</L>
<L>Beyond the proud oppressor's cruel grasp</L>
<L>Seated secure; uninjur'd; undestroy'd;</L>
<L>Worthy of Gods: The freedom of the mind.</L>

<HEAD>The INVITATION:

<Q><L>Hic gelidi fontes, hic mollia prata, Lycori,</L>
<L>Hic nemus: hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo.</L></Q>
<BIBL>VIRGIL.</BIBL>
<LG>
<L>HEALTH to my friend, and long unbroken years,</L>
<L>By storms unruffled and unstain'd by tears:</L>
<L>Wing'd by new joys may each white minute fly;</L>
<L>Spring on her cheek, and sunshine in her eye:</L>
<L>O'er that dear breast, where love and pity springs,</L>
<L>May peace eternal spread her downy wings:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="18"/>
Sweet beaming hope her path illumine still,</L>
<L>And fair ideas all her fancy fill.</L>
<L>From glittering scenes which strike the dazzled sight</L>
<L>With mimic grandeur and illusive light,</L>
<L>From idle hurry, and tumultuous noise,</L>
<L>From hollow friendships, and from sickly joys,</L>
<L>Will DELIA, at the muse's call retire</L>
<L>To the pure pleasures rural scenes inspire?</L>
<L>Will she from crowds and busy cities fly,</L>
<L>Where wreaths of curling smoke involve the sky,</L>
<L>To taste the grateful shade of spreading trees,</L>
<L>And drink the spirit of the mountain breeze?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When winter's hand the rough'ning year deforms,</L>
<L>And hollow winds foretel approaching storms,</L>
<L>Then Pleasure, like a bird of passage, flies</L>
<L>To brighter climes, and more indulgent skies;</L>
<L>Cities and courts allure her sprightly train,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="19"/>
From the bleak mountain and the naked plain;</L>
<L>And gold and gems with artificial blaze,</L>
<L>Supply the sickly sun's declining rays:</L>
<L>But soon returning on the western gale</L>
<L>She seeks the bosom of the grassy vale;</L>
<L>There, wrapt in careless ease, attunes the lyre</L>
<L>To the wild warblings of the woodland quire;</L>
<L>The daisied turf her humble throne supplies,</L>
<L>And early primroses around her rise.</L>
<L>We'll follow where the smiling goddess leads,</L>
<L>Thro' tangled forests or enamel'd meads;</L>
<L>O'er pathless hills her airy form we'll chase,</L>
<L>In silent glades her fairy footsteps trace:</L>
<L>Small pains there needs her footsteps to pursue,</L>
<L>She cannot fly from friendship, and from you.</L>
<L>Now the glad earth her frozen zone unbinds,</L>
<L>And o'er her bosom breathe the western winds:</L>
<L>Already now the snow-drop dares appear,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="20"/>
The first pale blossom of th' unripen'd year;</L>
<L>As FLORA'S breath, by some transforming power,</L>
<L>Had chang'd an icicle into a flower:</L>
<L>Its name, and hue, the scentless plant retains,</L>
<L>And winter lingers in its icy veins.</L>
<L>To these succeed the violet's dusky blue,</L>
<L>And each inferior flower of fainter hue;</L>
<L>Till riper months the perfect year disclose,</L>
<L>And FLORA cries exulting, See my Rose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse invites, my DELIA haste away,</L>
<L>And let us sweetly waste the careless day.</L>
<L>Here gentle summits lift their airy brow;</L>
<L>Down the green slope here winds the labouring plow;</L>
<L>Here bath'd by frequent show'rs cool vales are seen,</L>
<L>Cloath'd with fresh verdure, and eternal green;</L>
<L>Here smooth canals, across th' extended plain,</L>
<L>Stretch their long arms, to join the distant main:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="21" MS="y"/>
The sons of toil with many a weary stroke</L>
<L>Scoop the hard bosom of the solid rock;</L>
<L>Resistless thro' the stiff opposing clay</L>
<L>With steady patience work their gradual way;</L>
<L>Compel the genius of th' unwilling flood</L>
<L>Thro' the brown horrors of the aged wood;</L>
<L>Cross the lone waste the silver urn they pour,</L>
<L>And chear the barren heath or sullen moor:</L>
<L>The traveller with pleasing wonder sees</L>
<L>The white sail gleaming thro' the dusky trees;</L>
<L>And views the alter'd landscape with surprise,</L>
<L>And doubts the magic scenes which round him rise.</L>
<L>Now, like a flock of swans, above his head</L>
<L>Their woven wings the flying vessels spread;</L>
<L>Now meeting streams in artful mazes glide,</L>
<L>While each unmingled pours a separate tide;</L>
<L>Now through the hidden veins of earth they flow,</L>
<L>And visit sulphurous mines and caves below;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="22" MS="y"/>
The ductile streams obey the guiding hand,</L>
<L>And social plenty circles round the land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But nobler praise awaits our green retreats;</L>
<L>The Muses here have fixt their sacred seats.</L>
<L>Mark where its simple front yon mansion rears,</L>
<L>The nursery of men for future years:</L>
<L>Here callow chiefs and embryo statesmen lie,</L>
<L>And unfledg'd poets short excursions try:</L>
<L>While Mersey's gentle current, which too long</L>
<L>By fame neglected, and unknown to song,</L>
<L>Between his rushy banks, (no poet's theme)</L>
<L>Had crept inglorious, like a vulgar stream,</L>
<L>Reflects th' ascending seats with conscious pride,</L>
<L>And dares to emulate a classic tide.</L>
<L>Soft music breathes along each op'ning shade,</L>
<L>And sooths the dashing of his rough cascade.</L>
<L>With mystic lines his sands are figur'd o'er,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="23"/>
And circles trac'd upon the letter'd shore.</L>
<L>Beneath his willows rove th' inquiring youth,</L>
<L>And court the fair majestic form of truth.</L>
<L>Here nature opens all her secret springs,</L>
<L>And heav'n-born science plumes her eagle wings:</L>
<L>Too long had bigot rage, with malice swell'd,</L>
<L>Crush'd her strong pinions, and her flight witheld;</L>
<L>Too long to check her ardent progress strove:</L>
<L>So writhes the serpent round the bird of Jove;</L>
<L>Hangs on her flight, restrains her tow'ring wing,</L>
<L>Twists its dark folds, and points its venom'd sting.</L>
<L>Yet still (if aught aright the Muse divine)</L>
<L>Her rising pride shall mock the vain design;</L>
<L>On sounding pinions yet aloft shall soar,</L>
<L>And thro' the azure deep untravel'd paths explore.</L>
<L>Where science smiles, the Muses join the train;</L>
<L>And gentlest arts and purest manners reign.</L>
<L>Ye generous youth who love this studious shade,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="24"/>
How rich a field is to your hopes display'd!</L>
<L>Knowledge to you unlocks the classic page;</L>
<L>And virtue blossoms for a better age.</L>
<L>Oh golden days! oh bright unvalued hours!</L>
<L>What bliss (did ye but know that bliss) were yours?</L>
<L>With richest stores your glowing bosoms fraught,</L>
<L>Perception quick, and luxury of thought;</L>
<L>The high designs that heave the labouring soul,</L>
<L>Panting for fame, impatient of controul;</L>
<L>And fond enthusiastic thought, that feeds</L>
<L>On pictur'd tales of vast heroic deeds;</L>
<L>And quick affections, kindling into flame</L>
<L>At virtue's, or their country's honour'd name;</L>
<L>And spirits light to every joy in tune;</L>
<L>And friendship ardent as a summer's noon;</L>
<L>And generous scorn of vice's venal tribe;</L>
<L>And proud disdain of interest's sordid bribe;</L>
<L>And conscious honour's quick instinctive sense;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="25"/>
And smiles unforc'd; and easy confidence;</L>
<L>And vivid fancy; and clear simple truth;</L>
<L>And all the mental bloom of vernal youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How bright the scene to fancy's eye appears,</L>
<L>Thro' the long perspective of distant years,</L>
<L>When this, this little group their country calls</L>
<L>From academic shades and learned halls,</L>
<L>To fix her laws, her spirit to sustain,</L>
<L>And light up glory thro' her wide domain!</L>
<L>Their various tastes in different arts display'd,</L>
<L>Like temper'd harmony of light and shade,</L>
<L>With friendly union in one mass shall blend,</L>
<L>And this adorn the state, and that defend.</L>
<L>These the sequester'd shade shall cheaply please,</L>
<L>With learned labour and inglorious ease:</L>
<L>While those, impell'd by some resistless force,</L>
<L>O'er seas and rocks shall urge their vent'rous course;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="26"/>
Rich fruits matur'd by glowing suns behold,</L>
<L>And China's groves of vegetable gold;</L>
<L>From every land the various harvest spoil,</L>
<L>And bear the tribute to their native soil:</L>
<L>But tell each land (while every toil they share,</L>

<L>MAN is the nobler growth our realms supply,</L>
<L>And SOULS are ripen'd in our northern sky.</L>

<L>Some trace with curious search the hidden cause</L>
<L>Of nature's changes, and her various laws;</L>
<L>Untwist her beauteous web, disrobe her charms,</L>
<L>And hunt her to her elemental forms:</L>
<L>Or prove what hidden powers in herbs are found</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="27" MS="y"/>
To quench disease and staunch the burning wound;</L>
<L>With cordial drops the fainting head sustain,</L>

<L>The patriot passion this shall strongly feel,</L>

<L>This cloath'd with Britain's thunder, spread alarms</L>

<L>WHEN Cupid, wanton boy, was young,</L>

He loiter'd in Arcadian bowers,</L>

<L>Or pierc'd some fond unguarded heart,</L>
<L>With now and then a random dart;</L>

<LG>
<L>The potent sounds like light'ning dart</L>
<L>Resistless thro' the glowing heart;</L>

<L>High o'er fortune's proud controul;</L>
<L>Kindling deep, prophetic musing;</L>
<L>Love of beauteous death infusing;</L>
<L>Scorn, and unconquerable hate</L>
<L>Of tyrant pride's unhallow'd state.</L>
<L>The boy abash'd, and half afraid,</L>

<LG>
<L>GOD of my life! and author of my days!</L>
<L>Permit my feeble voice to lisp thy praise;</L>
<L>And trembling, take upon a mortal tongue</L>
<L>That hallow'd name to harps of Seraphs sung.</L>
<L>Yet here the brightest Seraphs could no more</L>
<L>Than hide their faces, tremble, and adore.</L>
<L>Worms, angels, men, in every different sphere</L>
<L>Are equal all, for all are nothing here.</L>
<L><PB N="126" REF="130"/>
All nature faints beneath the mighty name,</L>
<L>Which nature's works, thro' all their parts proclaim</L>
<L>I feel that name my inmost thoughts controul,</L>
<L>And breathe an awful stilness thro' my soul;</L>
<L>As by a charm, the waves of grief subside;</L>
<L>Impetuous passion stops her headlong tide;</L>
<L>At thy felt presence all emotions cease,</L>
<L>And my hush'd spirit finds a sudden peace,</L>
<L>Till every worldly thought within me dies,</L>

<L>But soon, alas! this holy calm is broke;</L>
<L>My soul submits to wear her wonted yoke;</L>
<L>With shackled pinions strives to soar in vain,</L>
<L>And mingles with the dross of earth again.</L>
<L>But he, our gracious Master, kind, as just,</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="131"/>
Knowing our frame, remembers man is dust:</L>
<L>His spirit, ever brooding o'er our mind,</L>
<L>Sees the first wish to better hopes inclin'd;</L>
<L>Marks the young dawn of every virtuous aim,</L>
<L>And fans the smoaking flax into a flame:</L>
<L>His ears are open to the softest cry,</L>
<L>His grace descends to meet the lifted eye;</L>
<L>He reads the language of a silent tear,</L>
<L>And sighs are incense from a heart sincere.</L>
<L>Such are the vows, the sacrifice I give;</L>
<L>Accept the vow, and bid the suppliant live:</L>
<L>From each terrestrial bondage set me free;</L>
<L>Hush every wish that centers not in thee;</L>
<L>Bid my fond hopes, my vain disquiets cease,</L>

When all is smiling, tranquil, and serene,</L>
<L>And vernal beauty paints the flattering scene,</L>

<L>With caution let me hear the Syren's voice,</L>
<L>And doubtful, with a trembling heart, rejoice.</L>

<L>If friendless, in a vale of tears I stray,</L>

Nor less the mystic characters I see</L>
<L>Wrought in each flower, inscrib'd on every tree;</L>
<L>In every leaf that trembles to the breeze</L>
<L>I hear the voice of GOD among the trees;</L>
<L>With thee in shady solitudes I walk,</L>
<L>With thee in busy crowded cities talk,</L>
<L>In every creature own thy forming power,</L>
<L>In each event thy providence adore.</L>
<L>Thy hopes shall animate my drooping soul,</L>
<L>Thy precepts guide me, and thy fear controul.</L>
<L>Thus shall I rest, unmov'd by all alarms,</L>
<L>Secure within the temple of thine arms,</L>
<L>From anxious cares, from gloomy terrors free,</L>
<L>And feel myself omnipotent in thee.</L>

I stand and stretch my view to either state;</L>

<Q>One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine.</Q>
<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL>
<LG>
<L>'TIS past! The sultry tyrant of the south</L>
<L>Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours</L>
<L>Move silent on; the skies no more repel</L>
<L>The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams</L>
<L>Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye</L>
<L>To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft</L>
<L>DIAN's bright crescent, like a silver bow</L>
<L>New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="136"/>
Impatient for the night, and seems to push</L>
<L>Her brother down the sky. Fair VENUS shines</L>
<L>Even in the eye of day; with sweetest beam</L>
<L>Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood</L>
<L>Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.</L>
<L>The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve</L>
<L>Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires</L>
<L>Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,</L>
<L>And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour</L>
<L>When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,</L>
<L>The cool damp grotto, or the lonely depth</L>
<L>Of unpierc'd woods, where wrapt in solid shade</L>
<L>She mused away the gaudy hours of noon,</L>
<L>And fed on thoughts unripen'd by the sun,</L>
<L>Moves forward; and with radiant finger points</L>
<L>To yon blue concave swell'd by breath divine,</L>
<L>Where, one by one, the living eyes of heaven</L>
<L>Awake, quick kindling o'er the face of ether</L>
<L><PB N="133" REF="137"/>
One boundless blaze; ten thousand trembling fires,</L>
<L>And dancing lustres, where th' unsteady eye</L>
<L>Restless, and dazzled wanders unconfin'd</L>
<L>O'er all this field of glories: spacious field!</L>
<L>And worthy of the master: he, whose hand</L>
<L>With hieroglyphics older than the Nile,</L>
<L>Inscrib'd the mystic tablet; hung on high</L>
<L>To public gaze, and said, adore, O man!</L>
<L>The finger of thy GOD. From what pure wells</L>
<L>Of milky light, what soft o'erflowing urn,</L>
<L>Are all these lamps so fill'd? these friendly lamps,</L>
<L>For ever streaming o'er the azure deep</L>
<L>To point our path, and light us to our home.</L>
<L>How soft they slide along their lucid spheres!</L>
<L>And silent as the foot of time, fulfil</L>
<L>Their destin'd courses: Nature's self is hush'd,</L>
<L>And, but a scatter'd leaf, which rustles thro'</L>
<L>The thick-wove foliage, not a sound is heard</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="138"/>
To break the midnight air; tho' the rais'd ear,</L>
<L>Intensely listening, drinks in every breath.</L>
<L>How deep the silence, yet how loud the praise!</L>
<L>But are they silent all? or is there not</L>
<L>A tongue in every star that talks with man,</L>
<L>And wooes him to be wise; nor wooes in vain:</L>
<L>This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,</L>
<L>And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.</L>
<L>At this still hour the self-collected soul</L>
<L>Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there</L>
<L>Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;</L>
<L>An embryo GOD; a spark of fire divine,</L>
<L>Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,</L>
<L>(Fair transitory creature of a day!)</L>
<L>Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrapt in shades</L>
<L>Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.</L>

<L>Ye citadels of light, and seats of GODS!</L>
<L>Perhaps my future home, from whence the soul</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="139"/>
Revolving periods past, may oft look back</L>
<L>With recollected tenderness, on all</L>
<L>The various busy scenes she left below,</L>
<L>Its deep laid projects and its strange events,</L>
<L>As on some fond and doating tale that sooth'd</L>
<L>Her infant hours; O be it lawful now</L>
<L>To tread the hallow'd circles of your courts,</L>
<L>And with mute wonder and delighted awe</L>
<L>Approach your burning confines. Seiz'd in thought</L>
<L>On fancy's wild and roving wing I sail,</L>
<L>From the green borders of the peopled earth,</L>
<L>And the pale moon, her duteous fair attendant;</L>
<L>From solitary Mars; from the vast orb</L>
<L>Of Jupiter, whose huge gigantic bulk</L>
<L>Dances in ether like the lightest leaf;</L>
<L>To the dim verge, the suburbs of the system,</L>
<L>Where chearless Saturn 'midst her watry moons</L>
<L>Girt with a lucid zone, majestic sits</L>
<L><PB N="136" REF="140"/>
In gloomy grandeur; like an exil'd queen</L>
<L>Amongst her weeping handmaids: fearless thence</L>
<L>I launch into the trackless deeps of space,</L>
<L>Where, burning round, ten thousand suns appear,</L>
<L>Of elder beam; which ask no leave to shine</L>
<L>Of our terrestrial star, nor borrow light</L>
<L>From the proud regent of our scanty day;</L>
<L>Sons of the morning, first born of creation,</L>
<L>And only less than him who marks their track,</L>
<L>And guides their fiery wheels. Here must I stop,</L>
<L>Or is there aught beyond? What hand unseen</L>
<L>Impels me onward thro' the glowing orbs</L>
<L>Of habitable nature; far remote,</L>
<L>To the dread confines of eternal night,</L>
<L>To solitudes of vast unpeopled space,</L>
<L>The desarts of creation, wide and wild;</L>
<L>Where embryo systems and unkindled suns</L>
<L>Sleep in the womb of chaos; fancy droops,</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="141"/>
And thought astonish'd stops her bold career.</L>
<L>But oh thou mighty mind! whose powerful word</L>
<L>Said, thus let all things be, and thus they were,</L>
<L>Where shall I seek thy presence? how unblam'd</L>
<L>Invoke thy dread perfection?</L>
<L>Have the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee?</L>
<L>Or does the beamy shoulder of Orion</L>
<L>Support thy throne? O look with pity down</L>
<L>On erring guilty man; not in thy names</L>
<L>Of terrour clad; not with those thunders arm'd</L>
<L>That conscious Sinai felt, when fear appall'd</L>
<L>The scatter'd tribes; thou hast a gentler voice,</L>
<L>That whispers comfort to the swelling heart,</L>
<L>Abash'd, yet longing to behold her Maker.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now my soul unus'd to stretch her powers</L>
<L>In flight so daring, drops her weary wing,</L>
<L>And seeks again the known accustom'd spot,</L>
<L><PB N="138" REF="142"/>
Drest up with sun, and shade, and lawns, and streams,</L>
<L>A mansion fair and spacious for its guest,</L>
<L>And full replete with wonders. Let me here</L>
<L>Content and grateful, wait th' appointed time</L>
<L>And ripen for the skies: the hour will come</L>
<L>When all these splendours bursting on my sight</L>
<L>Shall stand unveil'd, and to my ravished sense</L>
<L>Unlock the glories of the world unknown.</L>
