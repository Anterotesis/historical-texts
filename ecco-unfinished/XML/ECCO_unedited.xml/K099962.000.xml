<HEAD>PROLOGUE, Spoken by <HI>Comus.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AMIDST this gay Circle, bright beam's the fair Race,</L>
<L>Each Form's rich with Gesture, each Gesture with Grace;</L>
<L>Love laughs in their Looks: Youth blooms in each Cheek,</L>
<L>Sense speaks when they smile, and Wit smiles when they speak.</L>
<L>Gay dress'd Daughters of Beauty, ye Sons of True Taste,</L>
<L>This Evening accept of a Choice Spirits Feast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I've call'd them together, this Sett I've selected,</L>
<L>By <HI>Comus</HI> this Evening Collation's directed;</L>
<L>Great <HI>Bacchus</HI> the gay God of Bumper's my Sire,</L>
<L>Great <HI>Bacchus</HI> the Fuel and Life of Love's Fire;</L>
<L>Who bestows on the Lover Assurance to try,</L>
<L>And drowns in the Lady all Force to deny.</L>
<L>From him I'm descended, and thus spoke my Father,</L>
<L>Go; call the chief Sons of True Humour together.</L>
<L>Let Harmony usher the Things they shall say,</L>
<L>Be Laughter attendant, and Wit prompt the Play;</L>
<L>But banish low Quibble, and Sing-song impure,</L>
<L>Poor personal Satire, Entendres obscure.</L>
<L>Let not Ribaldry dare to offend the chaste Ear,</L>
<L>Nor Dullness, tho' even in Op'ra, appear;</L>
<L>Let Mirth by the Side of plain Sense take her Place,</L>
<L>And the Comic Muse smile undebauch'd by Grimace;</L>
<L>Do not stamp the Buffoon on the Sterling of Nature,</L>
<L>But the Sense of each Song be express'd in each Feature.</L>
<L>'Twas thus he commanded, I this had to say,</L>
<L>Come, Lads, let me see you know how to obey;</L>
<L>Ye social, harmonious Choice Spirits begin,</L>
<L>A Moment be silent, ye Fair, while they sing.</L>

<P>RECITATIVE.</P>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>WAS at a Ven'son Feast, at Cricket won,</L>
<L>By <HI>Lightfoot</HI>'s nimble Son:</L>
<L>Asleep in Jocky State</L>
<L>The Groom-like Squire sate,</L>
<L>Nodding in Elbow-chair.</L>
<L>His Brother Bucks were plac'd around,</L>
<L>Their Heads with unseam'd Hunting Caps were bound,</L>
<L>So should each Sportsman for the Chace be crown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! the Horn sounds, away, away,</L>
<L><HI>Aurora</HI> ushers in the Day;</L>
<L>The op'ning Hounds uncoupled view,</L>
<L>With deep-hung Dewlaps dash the Dew;</L>
<L>With swelling Notes and Head held back,</L>
<L>See the unharbour'd Stag burst thro' the Brake;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The high-bred Horse shakes his air-waving Mane,</L>
<L>Stamps o'er the sounding Earth, and scours along the plain.</L>

<LG>
<L>The list'ning Croud admir'd the Song, Horn ton'd,</L>
<L>Bravo! Bravissimo! they shout around;</L>
<L>Below, the Drawers Bravo back rebound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scar'd with the Noise, young Buck awakes,</L>
<L>And stares at all his Brother Rakes;</L>
<L>Then rubs his Eyes, asks what's o'Clock?</L>
<L>Startled, he hears the Watchman knock.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Silence thrice was call'd, and thrice 'twas broke,</L>
<L>When in a Fury thus young <HI>Lightfoot</HI> spoke:</L>
<L>Bring up the Watchman, seize the vile Invader;</L>
<L>Then up they dragg'd the Midnight Serenader.</L>
<L>When, lo! the Figure of <HI>Old Time</HI> appears,</L>
<L>His Face was furrow'd with five thousand Years.</L>
<L>Down his smooth Skull a single Lock was hung,</L>
<L>And feebly coughing, thus the Glutton sung:</L>
</LG>
<P>SONG.</P>
<LG>
<L>My Friends pray break up now you've Time,</L>
<L>You'll repent if in vain you are told;</L>
<L>Oh, why will not Bucks in their Prime,</L>
<L>Consider they are to grow old?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the pale Face of Winter appears,</L>
<L>And each late blossom'd Tree tops with Snow,</L>
<L>Thus our Heads, thinly spread with white Hairs,</L>
<L>Life's last wintry Evening will show.</L>

<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<LG>
<L>Like the Maim'd from long dreadful Campaigns</L>
<L>You are mark'd, by Debauch, full of Scars,</L>
<L>Sunken Eyes, feeble Hams, bloodless Veins,</L>
<L>Palsy shaking, and seiz'd by Catarrhs:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Toothless ye mump, and ye moan,</L>
<L>Your shrivel'd Cheeks twisting about,</L>
<L>Ye mumble, ye grumble, and groan,</L>
<L>Then die as a Candle goes out.</L>
</LG>
<P>RECITATIVE.</P>
<L>As when the rising Tempest rushing roars,</L>
<L>Sweeps off the Harvest, shakes the sounding shores;</L>
<L>Red Lightnings flash, Seas bellow, Thunder growls,</L>
<L>The uproar reaching to the Trembling Poles.</L>
<L>Waves, Winds, Rocks, Rain, Ships, Sands and Clouds contend,</L>
<L>And Shrieks and Swearing the wide welking rend.</L>
<L>In dreadfull Din thus rose the Drunken Crew,</L>
<L>Pipes, Glasses, Bottles, Punch Bowls, Flasks o'erthrew;</L>
<L>They gagg'd the Preacher, dash'd him to the ground,</L>
<L>And in a Pipe of Claret, <HI>Time</HI> was drown'd.</L>
<L>Huzza young <HI>Lightfoot</HI> cry'd, while in our prime,</L>
<L>Claret can always kill the bugbear <HI>Time.</HI></L>
<P>CHORUS.</P>
<L>The many rend the Room with loud Applause,</L>
<L>So <HI>Time</HI> was drown'd, and drinking won the Cause.</L>

<P>SONG.</P>
<LG>
<L>Come my Bucks, let to-night be devoted to drinking,</L>
<L>To-morrow's too soon to be troubled with thinking.</L>
<L>No more shall Time preach, nor no more shall we hear it,</L>
<L>For he's drown'd as he ought in a Hogshead of Claret.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Time is no more, or no more can forbid us,</L>
<L>Of that troublesome Guest a Choice Spirit has rid us;</L>
<L>Yet if Time shou'd be wanting for any Design,</L>
<L>Henceforth he is found in a Hogshead of Wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since Time is confin'd to our Wine let us think</L>
<L>By this Rule we are sure of our time when we drink.</L>
<L>Come, my Bucks, let your Glasses with Bumpers be prim'd,</L>
<L>Now we're certain our Drinking is always well tim'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>RECITATIVE.</P>
<L>Now the Heart-raising Horn at Distance blew,</L>
<L>Swift to the Chace, away the Sportsmen flew:</L>
<L>Shouting they rend the Air, each Hill resounds,</L>
<L>Loud neigh the Steeds, and louder ope the Hounds,</L>
<L>From babbling Eccho back the Noise rebounds.</L>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>Sooth'd with the Sounds, young Buck grew vain,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first on the Stage a new Tragedy's shown,</L>
<L>With Prologue and Pageant 'tis palm'd on the Town;</L>
<L>All be buskin'd the Hero, by Licence poetic,</L>
<L>Shews Attitude, Emphasis, Passion Theatric,</L>
<L>According to Law, <HI>Magna Charta</HI> Dramatic.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To read what is wrote in that Law I advise ye,</L>
<L><HI>Vide Shakespear's</HI> Reports, <HI>Primus Actus Elizae.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then enters the Epilogue Lady to show forth,</L>
<L>Makes a Curtsy all round, cry's your Servant, and so forth.</L>
<L>For the Town must have Farce after Tragedy follow;</L>
<L>As Children take Sugar when Physic they swallow.</L>
<L>The Curtain then drops, and the Lady Trips off.</L>
<L>The Moral is this, All the World's but a Laugh.</L>
<L>For the Space Time has fill'd 'twixt the Cradle and Coffin,</L>
<L>Let us think as we please, is fit only to laugh in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here is the Riddle, tho' Laughing's the Test,</L>
<L>The Touchstone distinguishing Man from a Beast:</L>
<L>Yet to know how to laugh, and to laugh in right Season,</L>
<L>Is an Art that can only be taught by right Reason.</L>
<L>Some fancy they laugh, tho' they don't know for what;</L>
<L>Some Men we laugh with, and some Men we laugh at.</L>
<L>The self-fancy'd Wisemen, in Consequence great,</L>
<L>Wou'd not laugh for the World—it takes off from their State.</L>
<L>While Romp-loving Virgins are loud in their Mirth,</L>
<L>And Squires and Aldermen roar the Laugh forth.</L>
<L>Old Maids who to Chastity Martyrs become,</L>
<L>And Canker-like gnaw the sweet Bud of Mirth's Bloom.</L>
<L>Like long-lain-by Armour, they're rusty with Scorn;</L>
<L>As Wine too long kept, will to Vinegar turn.</L>
<L>In Men 'tis the same; they may set up for Science,</L>
<L>And Cynical dare to set laugh at Defiance:</L>
<L>Their Learning, their Reason, their Wisdom they show,</L>
<L>Yet one half Hour's Laugh's beyond all that they know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To help that laugh on we've open'd our Feast,</L>
<L>If we've pleas'd, or if not, on this we must rest:</L>
<L>But if you laugh with us you then crown the Jest.</L>
