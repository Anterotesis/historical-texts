<HEAD>A LETTER FROM Captain <HI>TOM</HI> TO THE MOBB, Now Rais'd for Dr. Sacheberell.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen, Brothers, and Fellow-Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR so I shall still call you, tho at present you fight under a Usurper, and in De∣sence of so base a Cause, that your Ho∣nourable Forefathers would sooner have dy'd than list up a Club or a Paring-Shovel for't <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But as I was saying, Gentlemen, Do you consi∣der
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
what it is that you are now up for? It is to justify Dr. <HI>S—l</HI>'s Sermon against the Queen, Lords and Commons. Sure this must be a rare Sermon, that has so many and so learned Friends as you to defend it! But for my part, I have drank many Pots of Ale in reading it, with some of my most understanding Neighbours; and we can neither make Sense nor Divinity of it. I went one day to <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> and was reading it, with <HI>Will. Jobber</HI> and <HI>Dick, Trueman,</HI> and some others; and <HI>Will▪</HI> said, Pray God the Doctor han't been too free with my Wife, for I find many Say∣ings in that Sermon so like hers in some of her Tantrams, that he never could have them from any other body: And I have ask'd several Parsons, both High-Church and Low-Church, about it, and all agree that there's no Doctrine, no Learning, no Depth in it; nay, that what little Scripture he has brought into't, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alsify'd with wrong Turns and Misapplications. Many a better and more edifying Discourse have I made in <HI>Moorfields</HI> and <HI>Lincolns. Inns-fields,</HI> and to much better Pur∣poses. Mine have been always in Defence of the Protestant Religion and Government; but this Usurping Doctor, who is now at your Head, preaches for Popery and <HI>Perkin.</HI> A Blessed Cause for the free Citizens of <HI>London</HI> to appear in!</P>
<P>But then you'll say the Doctor has preach'd up Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance, and you stand up for them: Why, you Degenerate Boobys, if you believe the Doctor has preach'd in earnest such Doctrines, what makes you rise to fly in the Face, and to resist your lawful Governours? Does your Doctor preach one thing, and practise ano∣ther? But alas! you are so thick-skul'd, that you know not the meaning of those words Passive Obe∣dience
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
and Non-Resistance. I must tell you, they are two of the most Dangerous, Destructive, Hor∣rid Monsters, that ever were shown in <HI>England;</HI> and if the Parliament had not secur'd them by strong Chains, and confin'd them within such thick Walls, that they can never break out▪ most of the Men and Women in <HI>England</HI> had been devour'd by them long since, and few of the City Alder∣men or Merchants had been left worth one Groat. These worthy Doctrines, which you are now huz∣zaing for, gives up your Wives, your Children, your Goods and Fortunes, all to the Pleasure of a Tyrannical Prince; and if he comes to take your Lives, ravish your Wives and Daughters, &amp; make Ducks &amp; Drakes of all your Money, you are only to cry, <Q>“”Welcome, Sir, here's my Neck at your service: Will you please to lie with my Wife or my Daughter? And please to accept of all I have in the World.</Q> Is this a Cause for free∣born Subjects to engage in? I am asham'd and griev'd that such slavish Souls should dishonour the Name and Title of Mobb. But you are the first▪ and I hope will be the last Mobb, that ever stood up against Liberty and Property, and the Freedom of the Subject. You a Mobb! You are the Scum and Dregs, the Tools and Vassals of the Romish Brood, and sent from their dark hellish Cabals, once more (if you could) to blow up the Queen and Parliament.</P>
<P>Ay, #but you stand up for the Church, the High-Church! Pray, Gentlemen, what Church do you mean? Is it not the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> No other was ever known in <HI>England</HI> by the Name of High-Church: and I must needs say, that if you don't mean that, you mean nothing. Does not your Bully Doctor and his Faction now join with the
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Romish Party? Are not all the Papists and Non∣jurors in the Kingdom now working and plotting to encourage him? Are not many hundreds of that vile Race now among your selves? And how many <HI>Irish</HI> Papists were known to walk▪ &amp; huzza, and cry <HI>High-Church</HI> before your Doctor to the Temple? Pray, what Church are such Men for setting up? And pray consider, if your High-Churchmen, who call themselves Protestants, have not been making very fast towards <HI>Rome?</HI> Have they form'd no Projects for an Accomodation with the Popish Church in <HI>France?</HI> Have they not brought newly in among us several Popish, mere Popish Doctrines, and preach'd and publish'd them to the People? Are they not for changing the Sacrament into the Mass, the Idolatrous Mass, and making it a real Sacrifice? Are they not insisting against the Queen's Supremacy in the Church? Are not these Popish Tenets now held by all your High-Churchmen? And if they have gone so far under a Government which abhors Popery, what will they do when they get the Government, which they long for, on their side? Here, Gen∣tlemen, lies the Danger of the Church; not in those you call Low-Churchmen. Which of them has writ, or preach'd, or publish'd any thing in favour of the Dissenters? If they treat the Dis∣senters civilly, and say they ought to be us'd like Men and Christians, and good Fellow Subjects; are they for this to be call'd <HI>False Brethren</HI> and <HI>Traitors?</HI> If so, what Brethren are they, that keep constant company with Priests and Jesuits, that set up profess'd Jacobites for the Champions of their Party, that retail the pitiful Papers of the Nonjurors throughout the Kingdom, and lick
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
up the Spittle of that Party, to sputter it out a∣gain from their Pulpits?</P>
<P>You know, Gentlemen, that I was ever for Justice and fair Play, and for calling a Spade a Spade; and if you will have those you call Low-Churchmen to be Dissenters, then I claim all the High Ones for Papists, and will be bound to make out a much better Title to mine, than you can do to yours.</P>
<P>But will your Wisdoms please to consider, what Danger the Church is in, what one Injury has been done to it; is any part of its Doctrine or Dis∣cipline incroach'd upon? Is any part of its Re∣venues or Incomes taken away? Has any one Mi∣nister of the Church been disturb'd or affronted for doing his Duty? Are not the Laws &amp; Judges as favourable to it as ever? Are not the Bishops as much respected, and have as much Power and Credit as at any time since the Reformation? Does any Man traduce or vilify the worthy Pre∣lates who preserve our Constitution, except your High-Churchmen? and yet these are the Men for whom you leave your Stalls and your Bulks, to cry up High-Church. You besotted Fools! get you home to your Houses, if you have any, and bor∣row so much Sense from your honest Neighbours, as to know that the Church is in no Danger, since it has God to protect it, the Queen, and so many good Bishops to govern it, and the Lords and Commons to defend it, and a moderate peaceable Clergy to assert its Doctrines, and at the same time not to drive Men away from it by Fury, Ma∣lice and Railing. And now that you have ap∣pear'd in such a wretched Cause, and under such a Tool of a Champion, what mighty Actions have you done? Why truly you have gutted half a
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
dozen Meeting-Houses, and burnt the Pews: Great Feats indeed! Did any of you attempt a Jacobite or Popish Conventicle? No, these are your Ringleaders, the Knaves that work by such stupid Fools; you must not affront them nor your Master <HI>Perkin.</HI> But I think that few of you stir for this Cause alone, but to plunder, and rob, and pilfer Houses, and to beg or force Money from them, who dare not dony you. You Thieves, you everlasting Blot and Disgrace to the Honour of the Mobility! Did you ever hear or know that the Citizens, which I have so often and gloriously headed, did rob, or take Money, or plunder Hou∣ses? No, you poor mercenary Wretches, when I and my Friends rose, it was for Justice, and Liber∣ty, and the Government, and the Protestant Re∣ligion; and any one of mine that should take the value of a Penny to enrich himself, I would have hang'd him. But you scoundrel Rogues and Beg∣gars do it for Bread and Wages. And why so hard upon poor Dr. <HI>Burgess?</HI> Does not he divert you and your Betters two or three times a week at his own Expence? Has he or any of his Brethren preach'd or practis'd any thing against the Govern∣ment? Are not their People quiet, and loyal, and peaceable under Her Majesty? Have not they con∣tributed to the Revolution and the War, as much Blood and Treasure as their Neighbours? Have they not paid their Taxes as chearfully? And which of them have been found in any Plots or Treasons to bring in the <HI>French</HI> and your little Idol? Is it for being such good Subjects that their Houses must be pull'd down; &amp; because they have Toleration by Law, must they therefore be mur∣der'd▪ If there were one Drop of Protestant Blood in the whole Body of you, you cou'd not be
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
such ignorant besotted Beasts, so blindly to damn your selves and ruin your Neighbours, and all to make the Nation Slaves, and to bring in Wooden Shoes and <HI>French</HI> Popery.</P>
<P>But to let you see that you are worse than Brutes, that you are Rebels and Vipers in the Bosom of the Government; your honest and brave Country-Men have for twenty Years past hazarded their Lives in War against <HI>France,</HI> and under the Con∣duct of the great &amp; gallant Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> have brought more Honour and Glory to the Queen and Her Kingdoms, than all the Reigns of Her Predecessors together. And now that they have beaten the Tyrant Monsieur, and forc'd him to beg a Peace; you his hir'd Slaves, and Trai∣tors to GOD and your Country, have risen up to breed War and Sedition at Home: and by your Means, and the Hopes given the old Tyrant by your unnatural Rebellion, he designs to get that Advantage by your Villany and Treachery, that he never yet was able to get in the Field. Are you not rare <HI>Englishmen,</HI> fine Churchmen, excel∣lent Protestants, who now at this Time, when a happy Peace seems to draw on very fast towards us, are doing all in your Power to assist the Enemy of our Religion and Country, and to force such Terms of Peace upon us, as that cruel Tyrant may think fit to give? But this will be the last Attempt of you and your treacherous Party, and I doubt not to see many of the hardest and highest Heads of you justly hang'd up for it. I had some Thoughts to bring a hundred or two of my brave &amp; hearty Friends to suppress you and your Thousands; but the Government have sent a few Horse &amp; Foot, at the Sight of whom you run like your selves, and do now sculk like Jail-Birds, as I know the most
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
of you are. Yet I am told that you talk of ap∣pearing again; which if you da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e do, I shall shew you the Difference between freeborn, natural <HI>English</HI> Protestant Courage, and the rascal Cowardice of Popish Slaves, who rebel against their Queen and Country for <HI>French</HI> Money. I revoke the Titles of Gentlemen, &amp;c. that I gave you in the Begin∣ning of this Letter; for upon second and better Thoughts, you are such a Pack of hireling Scoun∣drels, that I now defy and despise you; and if you stir once more, am resolv'd to chastise you severely.</P>
