<HEAD>A Sharp REBUKE From one of the PEOPLE called <HI>QUAKERS,</HI> TO <HI>Henry Sacheverell,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Friend</HI> Henry Sacheverell,</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING been moved to speak unto others who inter∣meddle with publick Things whereunto they are not call'd, and being likewise inclined to rebuke many, who break forth in the same Evil Way, I write thee this Epistle in the next place.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
And howbeit thou art one of those, who settest at nought the Counsel of the Prudent, and who sittest in the Seat of the Scornful; nevertheless I am constrained to speak unto thee, if not for thy Amendment, (verily that will be according as thou shall't re∣ceive it) yet for thy Rebuke, and for the Sake of them that stand by.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou hast troubled <HI>Israel</HI> for some Years of thy Life past; and if I should look upon thee for the Days of thy Youth, thou hast not only spent them in much Vanity, but even in the Abominati∣on of unclean Things; howbeit I shall not, at this time, rebuke thee as thou art a Sin∣ner against the Lord, there is one that re∣buketh thee, even thy Conscience, who is the Minister of the Spirit within thee; who, if thou wouldest listen to its Voice, would with Faithfulness witness against thee, for thy vile Conversation, thy Drunkenness, thy Swearing, thy Abusing of Women, and many of thy said Practices, as well during thy Residence at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where thou ought∣test to have been an Instructor of Youth, and a Teacher of Vertue, as in <HI>Staffordshire, Worcestershire,</HI> and other Places, where thy Name is become a Stink in the Nostrils of the People.</P>
<P>But I wot <HI>Henry,</HI> that it seemeth more meet at this Time, to Commune with
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
thee in thy more Publick Capacity, and to Rebuke thee, as thou art an Offender a∣gainst Men; Verily in this, Friend <HI>Henry,</HI> thou art worthy of Rebuke; for thou hast not moved the People of the Land unto Peaceable Things, and to live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty, but thou hast moved to Wrath, to Strife, and to all that is Contentious among Men, wherein thou hast exceeded all that have gone before thee; neither hath any brought the Execution of Justice upon themselves with more just Demerit, than thou hast, al∣beit they have pass'd out of the Body there∣fore, and thou remainest for a while.</P>
<P>Plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> the Land hath been long afflicted, by reason of the Violence of thy Evil Tongue; for thou speakest Words of Bitterness in the House of Worship, and ex∣altest thyself against thy Rulers in the High-Place of the City; for this it hath pleased the Lord to Rebuke thee; for the whole Congregation spake with one Voice against thee, and the Assembly of the Nobles, the Princes, and the Elders Condemned thee; howbeit thou hearknedst not unto the Voice of Correction; they Reproved thee, but thou wast not Reproved, but thou hardnest thy Face as Brass, and thy Heart as a ne∣ther Millstone, and thou speakest in the Ears of the People, that thou wer't Righteous;
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
whereas they who judg'd in the Gates, saw that thou wer't Vile, yea, more Vile than those whom thou had'st reproved.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Mercy was shewn thee in the Days of the Reign of <HI>Anne</HI> the Queen, who being a Woman, was moved to have Compassion on thee; being deluded by thy Tongue, speaking borrowed Words, which albeit they were Words of Deceit and Falshood, yet prevailed on the merciful In∣firmities of the said Queen, and she was de∣sirous to have saved thee from Shame.</P>
<P>But thou exalted thy Head, and lifted'st up thyself as a Guiltless Person, causing thy∣self to rejoice in the Sentence of the Nobles, as if it had been a Deliverance, and taking to thyself vile Persons like unto thyself, thou raisedst a Sedition in the City, and casting Terror into the People, thou did'st, with vi∣olent Hands, fall upon the Synagogues of thy Brethren, causing much spoil.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for in this thou wer't guilty of Treason, and oughtest to have been car∣ry'd out of the City, and to have been ston'd with Stones unto the Death; Howbeit, the Ruler of thy People shewed thee Mercy, and even extended her said Mercy to those, who having been drawn in by thee to com∣mit Violence, were laid hold of by the Sol∣diers, and who having deserved to die, were spared, that innocent Blood might not lie
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
upon thee; for verily, had the Righteous Sentence of Death, whereto they were brought by the Laws of the Land, been Executed, and they had been put to Death, their Blood had been upon thy Head, and thou had'st been the Cause thereof; for thou wast the Raiser of the said Sedition; having by false Speeches perswaded the People that thou had'st been a just Man, and thou were't fallen upon, being Guiltless; and not only so, but that the Nobles and Elders of the Land had taken Council against the Temple of the Lord; all which Things were devised in thine own Heart, being nothing so in Truth; neither had they taken Council for Evil, but for Good, to punish thee according to thy Ways, and to prevent the rest of thy Tribe from teach∣ing Sedition among the People.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for thy Pride and the Naughtiness of thy Heart hath caused thee to commit greater Wickednesses than those; for thou wentest through the Cities of the Land, teaching that Men should strive, and do wickedly one towards ano∣ther; and that they should oppress thy Brethren thereby, filling Men's Minds with Evil against their Neighbours; divi∣ding Men against themselves; the Father against the Children, and the Children against the Father, throughout the whole
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Land of thy Nativity, from <HI>Dan</HI> even unto <HI>Beersheba;</HI> Preaching that all such were Enemies unto the Lord, who were not for running with thee <HI>into the same Excess of Riot;</HI> by which means thou deceived'st much People, gathering to thyself Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> in every City, following thee, and crying <HI>Hosannah,</HI> and saying, Blessed is he who cometh in the Name <HI>of the Church;</HI> whereas plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou knowest that thou camest in the Name of <HI>Sathan,</HI> and no other, being acted by the unclean Spi∣rit of Rage, Malice, Persecution, Pride and Envy, which is of the Devil, and tend∣eth to Destruction.</P>
<P>Moreover, thou art taxed with Subtilty and Equivocation, delivering thyself in de∣ceitful Words, that thy People might be deceived thereby; speaking Sentences of doubtful Interpretation, that so thou may'st reserve the Meaning thereof, as might best serve thy wicked Purposes: For thou deny∣est that the People called <HI>Dissenters</HI> are To∣lerated by Law, to use their own Way of Worship, and wilt have it only, that they are protected from Violence; so that these Laws which have obtained the Name of Tolerations, are called by thee Exempti∣ons only, from the Penalties of certain other Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Nevertheless thou hast not stopped here; for whereas thou hast acknowledg'd that the said <HI>Dissenters</HI> are exempted from Pu∣nishment for the Sake of their Separations, yet in the same Talk of thine, thou excitest to Punishments against them, cloathing thy Persecuting Spirit with the new fram'd Title of, wholesome Severities: Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for in this thou hast dealt deceitfully with thy Brethren, and hast shewn that thou art of the Bloody and Deceitful Men, who the Word saith, shall not live out half their Days.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am well assur'd that thou hast been an Old Offender against the Land of thy Nativity, and hast shewn thyself an Enemy to those who have sought the Peace of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and hast laid a Confederacy with those who have striken Hands with the STRANGER; nei∣ther am I of the Number of those who bear false Witness; for that divers of thy Bre∣thren testifie against thee, that thou used'st in thy Cups, and when thou hast drunken over-much Wine, as too frequently thou dost, <HI>Henry,</HI> I say unto thee, thou used'st in thy Cups, according to the Pro∣phane Usage of these Times, of drinking Healths, to drink a Health to the STRANGER, and with expressing plainly, that thou owned'st him to be thy King.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
And lest thou shouldest be tempted to gainsay this thing, I give thee to understand, that there is, at the City call'd <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a Person of good Name, and a Lover of the Truth, who is called <HI>D. B.....</HI> who affirmeth, and offereth thee, by me, <HI>Henry,</HI> to affirm it to thy Face, saying, <HI>That he hath seen thee kneel on thy Knees, and drink to the Health,</HI> as thou callest it, <HI>of the said STRANGER, calling him by the Title and Name of King</HI> James III. which if thou hast done, thou art more accursed than any that have been before thee; forasmuch as thou had'st, before that, solemnly, after the manner of Men, Abjur'd and Forsworn the Person, or Titles, of the said <HI>Stranger,</HI> saying, that he was no other than a Pretend∣er, and that he ought not to sit on the Throne; and that thou did'st thereby Be∣nounce and Reject him from thy Heart, freely and voluntarily, saying, That thou wilt not have this <HI>Man to Reign over thee:</HI> How abominable this Dealing is, thou well knowest, <HI>Henry;</HI> and that they who do these Things, are worthy of Death, forasmuch as the Laws of the Land have driven out this Person from among us, and that he is deemed a Stranger from hence∣forth for ever.</P>
<P>How thou answerest, <HI>Henry,</HI> to thy Conscience, and to the Light of Heaven shining within thy Spirit, that in Verity,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
I know not; but I give thee to understand, that if thou can'st not try and acquit thy∣self at that Bar, neither wilt thou be ac∣quitted before thy Father which is in Hea∣ven, but thou wilt have thy Reward with them, <HI>in whose Company thou wast willing to have left the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Devil and his Angels.</NOTE> Dissenters.</P>
<P>And what can'st thou say, O Man, to these Things? I hear that thou hard'nest thy Face against the Truth, saying, <HI>That these Things are not so:</HI> But verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou hast striven in vain to wash thy Hands, for thou art guilty; neither is there wanting those, <HI>who bear witness against thee in the Gates.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise thy Follies reprove thee, and thou hast been guilty of much Wickedness in former Times: Forasmuch as in the Town of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> thou did'st frequent∣ly use Cursings with Bitterness of Spirit, against the King who ruled at that Time, and whose Name was <HI>William,</HI> saying, that thou desired'st he should be torn in Pieces of the People, and likewise that thou did'st hope to see it with thine Eyes: Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this was a Wickedness to be punish'd by the Judge, and thou deser∣ved'st to have the same Thing done unto thee, that thou wouldest should be done
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
unto the Ruler of thy People; for a smuch as by the Laws of this our Land, whoso∣ever deviseth Evil <HI>against the King, is wor∣thy of Death.</HI></P>
<P>Verily it seemeth, that thou hast delight∣ed much in moving the People of the Land unto Sedition, and to raise Tumults against their Rulers; seeing thou wouldest in those Days, have had the People laid violent Hands on the King, and that since that, thou hast moved Sedition divers Times among the People, and hast led them wick∣edly to demolish the Houses of thy Brethren, and to walk Disorderly in the Streets: Nei∣ther, <HI>Henry,</HI> wast thou willing that they should end there, but that they should have proceeded, even unto the shedding of Blood.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am moved to tell thee, that thou art manisestly pushing the People of this Land upon the same unlawful Do∣ings, and Exhorting them to lift up their Hands against the King, using the Pretence of their Zeal for thy Church; insinuating wicked Things into their Thoughts, saying, <HI>Behold, the Church is in Danger,</HI> of which I must commune with thee a short while.</P>
<P>Plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> it appeareth unto me something strange, that thou, who art guilty of these Hainous Things, can'st teach, That Men <HI>should not murther Kings;</HI> neither
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
can'st thou speak on the 30<HI>th</HI> Day of the First Month, against killing the Anointed of the Lord; for a smuch as thou did'st open∣ly profess thy desire to see <HI>William our King,</HI> a just Man, and upright, torn in pieces by the Hands of violent Men: There are among the People, <HI>Henry,</HI> who say, that in speaking those Words thou art veri∣ly Guilty of killing the King thy self, inas∣much as to desire to commit a Sin, if Pow∣er to do it were to be obtain'd, is equiva∣lent in Guilt, to the Fact itself, if there ap∣pears to be a fixed Resolution to perform the same. Wherefore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I ad∣monish thee that thou refrain from all Com∣plaints of the Actions of Evil Men against their Kings in Ancient Times, for a smuch as thou approvest of Actions, whose Ten∣dency is the same: And for a smuch as eve∣ry Tumult and Sedition raised against the King, is a bringing him to the Block, in its degree, as it testifies what would be, if Power, suitable to the Wrath of Evil Men were supply'd, and if they were not re∣strained from falling upon their King by some good Spirit within them, opposing their perverse Designs: Seeing then thou did st declare thy Desire to see the said <HI>William</HI> the King, at that time put to Death, and that even by the Hands of violent and tumultuous Men, not by the
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Process of the Laws; thy Confidence, is marvellous great, who canst con∣demn the Actions of thy Fathers, <HI>(for it seemeth thou art thy self of that Race,)</HI> for put∣ting the King of the Land to Death: Verily thou, herein by thy Actions, approvest what thou also condemnest in Words.</P>
<P>To what Purpose then, are thy Teach∣ings and thy loud Railings, seeing thou art in this Thing a double Dealer? Thou that teachest Men should not kill Kings; Dost thou tear Kings in Pieces by the Tumults of the People? For saying that thou desirest to have it so, and hopest to see it, is no less than doing it, in the Judg∣ment of Truth.</P>
<P>Peradventure, <HI>Henry,</HI> Satan may tempt thee to deny the Truth, saying, that thou did'st not utter such Words concerning the King, as I lay unto thy Charge, but lest thou should'st thus transgress, adding one Sin unto another, thou may'st understand that thou can'st not cover thy Offence in such a Manner, forasmuch as there are up∣right Men who have given their Affirma∣tion that thou did'st verily speak with thy Tongue those Words of Wickedness, a∣gainst the aforesaid <HI>William,</HI> even at the Time when he was <HI>thy King,</HI> and I have been help'd to a Copy thereof, that thou may'st be convinc'd and may'st not gainsay
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
the Truth; and albeit, <HI>Henry,</HI> that Friends do not approve of the Way which Men take to confirm Things in the World <HI>(viz.)</HI> By swearing an Oath; yet will I not say, that the Things whereunto they do swear are therefore not to be believ'd; but were it so, that Friends give no more than ordi∣nary Belief to the Things to which the Custom of Men hath annex'd an Oath; yet to thee <HI>Henry,</HI> with whom these Things are held to be sacred, an Oath for Confir∣mation is to thee, the End of all Strife; nei∣ther may'st thou be allowed to dispute any farther, after a Man who is reputed Just, and is not of Evil Fame, <HI>like thee,</HI> has an∣nexed an Oath to the Thing which he hath said.</P>
<P>Having premised these Things, I here lay before thy Eyes the Oath made a∣gainst thee by a Just and Good Man, who, Friends say, would not speak against the Truth, by which the Wickedness of thy Heart may be made manifest, and so thou may'st, if the Lord please, be brought to Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>[Samuel Eboral]</HI> of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> in the County of Warwick, <HI>maketh Oath,</HI> that a∣bout twelve or thirteen Years ago, as near as this Deponent can remember, he was in compa∣ny with Dr. <HI>Henry Sacheverel,</HI> together with one <HI>William Daggett,</HI> Clerk, and <HI>Henry</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<HI>Porter,</HI> Mercer, Father in Law to this Depo∣nent, and some others, at the House of Mr. <HI>John Hopkins,</HI> an Ironmonger in Birming∣ham, where he heard the said <HI>Henry Sacheve∣rel</HI> speak the following Words, or Words to this Effect, <HI>(viz.) I don't doubt but that I shall live to see King</HI> William <HI>De-witted, and I hope in God I shall.</HI> Ʋpon the speaking of which Words the said <HI>William Daggett</HI> then sharply reprov'd the said <HI>Henry Sacheverel.</HI></P>
<P>Sworn <HI>May</HI> the <HI>6</HI>th <HI>1710.</HI> be∣fore <HI>Bassel St. Nicholas</HI> Esq. at Knoll, in the County of War∣wick; one of Her Majesties Justices of the Peace.</P>
<BIBL>Samuel Eboral.</BIBL>
<P>After these Things being testify'd against thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> I advise and admonish thee, that thou would'st no more speak against those who hold it lawful to put Tyrants to Death, whether Kings or Rulers of a lower Degree, <HI>for out of thy own Mouth shalt thou be judged,</HI> in that thou hast thus openly condemn'd a just Ruler to be mur∣ther'd by the Hands of the lowest of the People, <HI>to wit,</HI> by the Rabble.</P>
<P>Likewise Friend <HI>Henry,</HI> I admonish thee that thou beest not in a Passion, neither sufferest thy Wrath to wax hot against those Men who may greet thee with the Name of <HI>Jacobite,</HI> which as I understand
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
is given unto such as are Ill-Willers to the Government of the Land, as it was settled by wise Men, in the Days of <HI>William</HI> the King, and on the Foundation whereof the Man <HI>George</HI> is now receiv'd as King among the People; assuredly, <HI>Henry,</HI> thy own Mind bears Witness to thee, and the Spirit that is within thee knoweth that thou hatest the King, and that thou hast given thy self up unto <HI>The Stranger</HI> whom the Lord abhorreth. And how cometh it to pass that thou who callest thy self a Prophet of the Lord, canst thus counterfeit with the People? Thinkest thou that he who knoweth thy Heart, sees not thy Hypo∣crisy, and knoweth not that thou hast lifted up thy Hand to him in Wickedness, and call'd him to Witness to thy Perjury, when thou abjurest the Stranger whom thy Soul loveth, and hast sworn fealty unto him whom thou cursed'st with thy Lips?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> these are Things which even wicked Men abhor, and none but he that is viler than the Vilest can away with them; for these Things hath the Lord made thee <HI>a Hissing</HI> and <HI>a By Word</HI> among the People of the Land, and thy Name will be a Curse unto all Generations; and it shall be hereafter, that when one Man shall curse another, he shall say, <HI>The Lord make thee as Sacheverel, whom the People of the Land abhorr'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
These Things are said unto thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> concerning Things past; It behoveth me to commune with thee likewise of Things to come, and of thy present Behaviour, in which thou deservest much Rebuke, for that thou hast taught the People to do wickedly, and hast endeavour'd to raise Sedition, saying, that thy Church is in Danger. It seemeth strange to me, who am not of thy Church, what Danger thou canst think thy Church is in from the King, who hath not only given thee and the Peo∣ple of the Land all the Assurances of his In∣clination to preserve it, saying, that he will on all Occasions study the Security thereof, but hast entred into the Commu∣nion, as thou callest it, of thy Church, and hath thereby made it his own Church, and made himself a Branch thereof, so that to wound the Interest of the said Church, is now to wound himself, and to hurt his own Interest; seeing it is apparent unto me, <HI>Henry,</HI> that the Church of this Land and the King of this Land hath, at this Time but one Interest; neither can they be separated by any Means whatsoever.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Henry,</HI> I would enquire of thee what thou thinkest of the Churches or Assemblys of those People abroad, who are vulgarly call'd Protestants, and where∣fore thou seemest to think that they are all
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of them dangerous to thy Church? Is thy Church afraid of all the Protestant Churches of the World? Verily, thou art unjustly dealing with thy Church; neither is there any Reason to fear, that a Protestant King can be dangerous to thy Church, of what∣soever Kind or Sect of Protestant he shall be, seeing there are none who can make any Advantage unto themselves by it; and thou knowest, <HI>Henry,</HI> that where there is no Advantage accruing to Men, they are not zealous in bringing Things to pass.</P>
<P>It hath been objected by thy Fellows in troubling the People, that the Care of the King in preserving the Church is but small, because of his being a <HI>Lutheran;</HI> thou wilt cause the People to laugh thee to Scorn, shouldst thou persist herein; for thou canst not be so foolish to say, that the King can have Thoughts of making the People of the Land turn <HI>Lutherans;</HI> and why then should not the King be as zealous for thy Church as for any other? Neither hast thou yet been able to signify to thy People what Church, or what Religion thy Church is in Danger from: It seemeth plain unto me that thou art not afraid of the Popish Church, as it is call'd, neither canst thou alledge that the Land of thy Nativity is in Danger of Popery, while the King who is on the Throne liveth.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
True it is, <HI>Henry,</HI> and Woe unto thee therefore, that while the Expectation of <HI>the Stranger</HI> was among the People, and his Interest seem'd too much to prevail, there might be some Reason to think of the Evil Days of Persecution, and of the Ruin, not of thy Church only, but of all the Lord's People in this Land, on that Ac∣count: But alas for thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou wert quiet and Peaceable under all that could be said thereof; neither could the Danger of Idolatry and Superstition make thee afraid, but thou rejoyced in Hope of <HI>the Stran∣ger,</HI> saying, <HI>all should be well,</HI> and that thy Church would <HI>not</HI> be <HI>in Danger,</HI> altho' the Man were to sit on the Throne who ab∣hor'd her with his whole Heart.</P>
<P>These Things, <HI>Henry,</HI> discover the Naughtyness of thy Heart and thy great Hypocrisy; for as much as thou hast been willing to expose thy Church to the Dan∣ger of an open and proclaimed Enemy, made so not by Education and Principle only, but provoked to be so by that which he supposes to be the greatest Injury to him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Banishing, Attainting, and Abjure∣ing him, by which all his Passions are en∣gag'd to revenge his Wrongs as well as his Religion, upon thy Church; and where then is thy Zeal for thy Church, when thou could'st rest satisfy'd under these Things, whereas under a Person differing in no∣thing
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
from thy Church, but joyning with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in every Part of thy Worship, thou art affrighting thy People with much A∣mazement about thy Church?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> it seems doubtful unto many, what it is thou meanest when thou speakest of thy Church, and whether the Church, as they call it, to which <HI>the Stran∣ger</HI> belongeth, is not secretly espousedby thee, as <HI>thy Church;</HI> for it is difficult to comprehend many of thy Actions, with∣out suspecting thee of Principles, which the Church, thou sayest thou art of, ab∣hors; of which I may give thee this one Example taken from thy self, and thy late Behaviour among the People, <HI>to wit,</HI> that of Rebellion.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thy Voice is not like the Voice of those who have spoken in the Assembly of the Princes, that they believ'd the Doctrine of unlimited Obedience, and that they were Children of the Tribe of <HI>Issachar:</HI> Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for I wot that in the room of passive Submissions and Obe∣dience to the King, thou art among the Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> who <HI>Curse the King in their Bed-Chambers,</HI> and thou openest thy Mouth against thy Rulers, even in the High Places of the City.</P>
<P>Thinkest thou, that these Things can be done in the Land, and the People shall not be offended at thee? Nay, it maketh thee
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
to stink in the Nostrils of the People, and thou art abhorr'd of those who love the Prosperity of the Land.</P>
<P>Likewise, I counsel thee to call to Mind how in these Things thou art an Enemy, even to that Church which thou call'st <HI>thy Mother,</HI> and which if thou did'st indeed believe to be thy <HI>Spiritual Mother,</HI> thou would'st have more concern for than to ex∣pose in so unrighteous and ungodly a Man∣ner; for thou art, <HI>as much as in thee lies,</HI> drawing thy said <HI>Spiritual Mother</HI> into di∣vers Snares, Mischeifs, and Distresses, such as mistaking her Friends and faithful Protectors, for her Enemies and Betrayers; and on the other Hand, embracing her Enemies as her Friends and Protectors; and were it not that I can prophesy to thee from the Lord, that thou wilt miscarry in this thy wicked Design, I should▪ inlarge on the Evil Consequences thereof to the said Church her self, as well as to the whole Land. But be thou assured, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou shalt not prevail, but thou shalt see that Mother of thine, as thou falsly call'st her, disown and discard thee as a spurious Child, impos'd upon her like <HI>the Stranger,</HI> and as one whom she having nourished in her Bo∣som, has hiss'd at her who has done thee good, and would'st have deliver'd her up to the Ravisher to be oppress'd and de∣stroy'd;
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
this thou may'st be assured will be thy Portion, unless thou repent.</P>
<P>Thou art in the mean Time, farther expo∣sed in thy Wickedness; for that thou who hast boasted so much in old Time of thy great Loyalty#can'st now behave thy self towards the Rulers, in a manner indecent for thee, as thou art a Teacher; for thou art Dis∣obedient, Unquiet and Unpeaceable under the King, who hath, as yet given thee no Offence, neither hath he done thee any Wrong: In this I must Rebuke thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> and all those who cleave unto thee, for wherein hath the King done Evil unto thee, and what hath he yet done against thy Church, that thou revilest him, SAYING <HI>he will overthrow the Church:</HI> Verily this is rendering Evil for Good unto the King, and is a Wickedness in thee which deserves Rebuke.</P>
<P>Neither is this all; but I am moved in Spirit to say unto thee, That the Reason of thy Discontents is naked and open to all thy Neighbours; even because thy Com∣panions, and those with whom thou art Confederated, are displaced, and are not entred into the Number of the King's Worthies; therefore art thou Wrath, and castest Dust into the Air, with thy Voice saying, That Wickedness reigneth, and that Righteousness is trodden under Foot:
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
In this it appeareth that thou regardest not the Truth, but art moved with Envy, Pride and Partiality; otherwise if Just and Upright Men are chosen by the King to be his Counsellors, and his Captains of Thousands, to lead forth his Armies, and to go in and out before the People, it would satisfie thee in behalf of thy Land, albeit the Men whom thou art joyned un∣to, were not of that Number. But thy Discontent appears manifestly to be be∣cause the evil Men, with whom thou hast stricken Hands, are disliked by the King, which is unjust in thee to thy Lord the King. For verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this Matter is of the Lord, neither has the King turned to the Right-Hand, or to the Left, but as he hath been guided by the Voice of the People of the Land; for as to the Stranger, whom thou worshipest, thou seest the Land hath spued him out, and all those who went a Whoring after him are cast out out with him. Verily this is of God, and who art thou, that thou shouldest lift up thy Hand against the Lord!</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Henry,</HI> it becometh thee to explain thy self, and to tell thy Brethren what thou meanest, if there be ought of Meaning in thy Ways, by saying thy Church is in Danger from the Men whom the King hath chosen for his Servants in the

Government of thy Land; seeing they are prescribed in all their Doings by the Laws of the Land, neither can they turn to the Right-Hand, nor to the Left, but as they are permitted to do so by the Judgments and Statutes of the Kings: And if at any time they transgress the said Judgments and Statutes, thou mayest bring them be∣fore the Ruler, and cause them to be Judg∣ed in the Gate; and that if Sentence pass against them by the Judges, thou knowest that even the King himself, cannot save them from thy Hand, but all the Congregation may Stone them with Stones until they die; forasmuch as it is not in the Power of the King to Pardon such Crimes of which evil Men shall be accused by the Assembly of the Princes, and the Elders of the Land.</P>
<P>It seemeth then, <HI>Henry,</HI> that these Men cannot act against the Church, because they cannot act against the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties of the said Church, as well as of the People, are settled on the Foundations of the Laws, and cannot be Invaded unless the said Laws are first bro∣ken and overthrown; which as I have said unto thee, cannot be done by these Men.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> even the King himself is restrained in Ruling the People of the Land, and is limited to do the same according

to the said Laws; neither may he Trans∣gress the same in Governing the Land with∣out violation of Right, and overturning that Constitution by which his own Right of Governing is Established; so that thy Church is founded upon a human Rock, whatever it be as to the spiritual Foundati∣on; about which, at this Time, <HI>Henry,</HI> thee and I shall have no Words: I say un∣to thee, That thy Church is so founded on a Rock of humane Laws, that it is not in the Power of the King, much less of his Worthies and great Men to hurt or over∣throw the same. And how sayest thou, O vain Man, that <HI>the Church is in Danger?</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I enquire of thee how it cometh to pass, that all those who who are Chosen by the King, to be his Servants, are deemed by thee to be Enemies to the Church? It appeareth unto me that they are themselves part of the Body which thou callest the Church; and if they are the same Body, and thou thus dividest thyself from them, then art thou an Enemy to the Church likewise; foras∣much as dividing the Church against itself, is Fatal: For how can the Church, any more than the Kingdom, stand which is divided against itself? Believe me, <HI>Henry,</HI> it will not be easie to the Generations to come, to know whether thou and thy
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Party have not been the greatest and most mischievous Enemies of thy own Church. Veril, there will be much Reason to judge that it is so; forasmuch as thy Ways which are wicked and unrighteous, have thereby a tendency to the destroying Religion from among the Nations of the Earth.</P>
<P>And how cometh it to pass that thou wouldest be esteemed a Man zealous for the Church, seeing thou hast not been wanting to acquaint the People, who are about thee, that thou fearest not God, but that thou runnest out into excess of Riot, with all Prophaness, Drunkenness, and want of Sobriety in thy Conversation? Thinkest thou that any of those, who behold thy walking in unclean Ways, and selling thy self to do Wickedly, will believe that thou hast any true Concern for the Church? I am moved in Spirit against thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> to declare to thee, in the Name of the Lord, That when evil Men cry, the <HI>Temple of the Lord,</HI> the <HI>Temple of the Lord,</HI> it is manifest that Wickedness is in their Hands, and they are set upon Violence in the Land.</P>
<P>And know thou for certain, That where∣as thou and thy Friends make an Hypocri∣tical Shew of Zeal for the Church, there∣by to deceive and misguide simple Ones, the Church herself will cast thee and them out, as her most dangerous Enemies; and
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
will abhor thee, for that she sees herself in a safer Condition by far, than when thou raisest the People of the Land into a Sedi∣tion on Pretence of defending her.</P>
<P>I have hear'd that thou and many of thy Tribe, have made deep Wounds in the Body of her whom thou call'st thy Mother, and for whom thou makest much Stir, by the evil Examples shewn to the People; and verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> I must say un∣to thee, That the true Danger of thy Church, and perhaps I might say, the only real Danger of thy Church is from the vitious and reproachful Lives of those who call themselves the Clergy, or the Teachers of the People.</P>
<P>And verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this leadeth me to put thee in Mind of a very known Evil, and to search after the Reason thereof; to wit, That almost all the under Teachers of thy Church, the Clergy as thou callest them, who are of the inferiour Rank, are Enemies to the King upon the Throne. Is it not because the Liberties of thy Coun∣try are restored by him, and the Hearts of the People of the Land are made glad; therefore thinkest thou, <HI>Henry,</HI> that thy Brethren, the Sons of <HI>Levt,</HI> do not bring upon themselves a Blot; and become there∣by a Scorn, and a By-Word among the People, seeing they are alone Sad, when
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
<HI>Israel</HI> Rejoice; and that the restoring and healing the Land should be grievous to them, more than to any other of the Peo∣ple? Is it not a strange Thing, <HI>Henry,</HI> that thee and thy Tribe should be alone among the People, that Rejoyce not, altho' the Lord hath brought to pass a great Thing this Day in <HI>Israel?</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am moved to ask a Question of thee, which if thou wilt An∣swer with Sincerity, may do thee much good: The bringing in of the King, who is called <HI>George, is of God,</HI> Henry, or <HI>is of Man only?</HI> If thou sayest it is of Men only, why doest thou, and most of thy Tribe acknowledge him, and lift up thy Hands to swear unto the Lord that thou ownest him to be the Lord's Anointed? Again, <HI>Henry,</HI> If thou sayest <HI>it is of God,</HI> why then dost thou not be glad and Rejoice therein, as the rest of the People of the Land also do? Verily herein thou do'st discover thy Hypocrisie, and the naugh∣tiness of thine Heart; and albeit thou hast made an Oath unto the Lord, and hast lifted up thy Hand, saying, That the Man GEORGE is thy Lawful King: Never∣theless thou hast secretly turned aside thy Heart after the STRANGER, and hast desired the hurt of thy People.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>
And wherefore dost thou, and the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> deceive the Lord's People, saying, we are for <HI>the King,</HI> whereas thy Heart testi∣fies against thee, that thou art an Enemy unto the King, and art of the Number of those who murmer against the King, say∣ing, <HI>we will not have this Man to reign over us?</HI> Wherefore, I rebuke thee in the Name of the Lord, saying, that thou hast done very wickedly, and I admonish thee to re∣pent, and do Justice to the King, and to his Servants whom thou hast dealt un∣righteously with, and say no more to thy People, that thy Church is in any Danger from the Reign of the King upon the Throne: but open thine Eyes, and see, and confess with thy Mouth what thy Spi∣rit beareth Witness of unto thee, <HI>to wit,</HI> that for the Iniquity of the Priests the Temple is in Danger, that it is ye who have made the People to transgress and to set their Faces against the Lord, and a∣gainst the great Things which he hath done for this Land.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>Henry,</HI> I admonish thee to con∣sider thy Evil Ways in Time▪ and I Coun∣sel thee to acknowldge thy Offences, lest, thou come to Shame; for verily, thy Ways <HI>are Ways of Death, and thy Steps lead towards Destruction:</HI> Beware how thou act with Evil Men, and
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
how thou Embrace the House of the <HI>Stranger,</HI> lest thou be reckoned among the accursed, and thy End be, to be hanged up∣on a Tree. For verily, thy Ways are provoking, and the Faces of the Peo∣ple of the Land are set against thee for Evil, saying, <HI>Away with this Fellow, for it is not fit that he should live;</HI> and this I say unto thee for thy Good; for how can'st thou escape in the Day when it shall be said by the King, as of Old Time, <HI>As for those mine Enemies who would not that I should Reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me.</HI></P>
<P>Neither can'st thou think to escape the Justice of thy Country, whom thou hast so many Ways offended; the People of the Land whom thou hast abused and deceived, will certainly Stone thee with Stones; for∣asmuch as thou hast kindled Strife among them with vain Words, saying; <HI>Hate ye one another, Persecute ye one another, and bear false Witness against one another;</HI> Thinkest thou not, <HI>O Son of Belial,</HI> that the People of the Land, when they shall come to speak Peace to each other, not∣withstanding thy kindling a Fire of Strife a∣mong them, will not abhorr thee, and fall upon thee, saying, thou art not fit to abide among them.</P>
<P>Flatter not thyself, <HI>Henry,</HI> with the
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Popular Applause which weak and silly Women have heaped upon thee, thinking that this will avail thee now; Knowest thou not the Vanity of these Things? And hast thou not seen, that the Shouts of the Mul∣titude, like a Sound afar off, are hard to be distinguish'd? And that no Weight is to be laid thereon, whether they say <HI>Hosannah</HI> or <HI>Crucifie?</HI> Moreover, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou well knowest, that thy Praise was among the Vilest of the People; That thou wert puffed up with Pride, without Cause, see∣ing the Elders praised thee not, but thou were Exalted by the vain Ones, who prai∣sed thee for doing Evil; which Praise so raised thy Vanity likewise, that thou hast not known thyself; neither hast thou con∣tained within the Bounds of thy Reason or Duty, whether it be thy Duty to God, or thy Duty to Man. This Men call Arro∣gance, in which thou dost, indeed, abound, beyond all Men that have worn the Habit of thy Tribe, in this our Day: Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> it is said of thee, by those who know thee right well, that thou art the proudest among Men, and that thy Vanity is insup∣portable, even in private, like as it has been in publick.</P>
<P>But I Counsel thee, I say, not to flatter thyself with the Applause of thy Party; for know, O vain Man, that the Grave open∣eth
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
her Mouth wide, Hell groaneth, and Destruction lifteth up her Voice; not for thee, <HI>Henry</HI> only, <HI>unless thou repent not,</HI> but even for the whole Party of thy Upsetters and supporting Friends, I mean <HI>the People called TORIES,</HI> the Name of whom shall fall into Perdition, never to rise any more; <HI>nay, Henry,</HI> they are are already fallen with a mighty Fall, they are sunk into the Depths like a Millstone, which is cast into the Sea, neither is it possible that they should be seen any more at all.</P>
<P>Wherefore then boastest thou thyself? Thinkest thou that the Man <HI>George,</HI> whom the Lord hath delighted in, and has chosen to Exalt, and who the Princes and great Men of the Land have placed upon the Throne, even as the Lord hath Command∣ed; thinkest thou, I say, that he can ever be prevail'd with, to receive into his Bo∣some any of those thy People, who are cal∣led <HI>Tories?</HI> Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> but be not thou so vain, for this Thing cannot come to pass in the Land, seeing <HI>the King</HI> knoweth that they are wicked Men and Sons of <HI>Be∣lial,</HI> Men not fearing the Lord, neither working the Thing which is right in the Land.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> The King knoweth like∣wise, that the said People called <HI>TORIES</HI> are Adversaries to the House of his Fa∣thers;
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
that they have despised him in the Day of his Estrangement, and joined them∣selves with the Men who said, <HI>they would not that he should reign over them;</HI> so that it seemeth not reasonable to believe, that <HI>the King</HI> shall be deceived by these Evil Men, to trust them or make Peace with them any more.</P>
<P>Neither, <HI>Henry,</HI> will the Nations round about have Friendship with us, if these Men should again be taken into the King's Favour; forasmuch as it is said of them, that they have deceived those who trusted in them formerly, having made a League with the Uncircumcised, and having said to the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> Thou art my Brother, tho' he served other Gods, and altho' he has often made <HI>Israel</HI> to Sin.</P>
<P>For this Cause, thy People called <HI>Tories</HI> are justly hated of thy Brethren, and of all the Nations who call upon the Name of the Lord; neither will any of the said Na∣tions speak Peaceably unto them any more; so, then, <HI>Henry,</HI> thy said Friends being justly abhorr'd, both of our King and of all the Lord's People, and of all the Nations round about, What Hopes can there be left unto thee, that they should ever be set on high any more, unless <HI>the King of Assyria prevail, and come up again to take our City, and carry us into Captivi∣ty?</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
And then thou wouldest rejoice, albe∣it the Church of which thou pretendest to speak, should be utterly overthrown, and the Temple of the Lord be destroy'd, as would be the Case, if thy Friends prevail in the Land: So that, in Truth, <HI>Henry,</HI> the Danger of thy Church, lieth only in the Danger of Restoring the Scepter of <HI>Ju∣dah</HI> into the Hands of the Heathen, <HI>I say, the Heathen People called Tories,</HI> of whom thou hast made thyself a Captain.</P>
