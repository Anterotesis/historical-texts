Will. &amp; Briss.</HI> Alauda Caelipeta, <HI>Klein.</HI> The Sky-lark or Field-lark, <HI>Lath. Penn. Alb. Will.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The ancient Greek name, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is derived from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a helmet, on account of its crest: it had the epithets, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; i.e. <HI>attached to the ground, excelling in song, distinguished in plumage, and of vigorous wing.</HI></P>
<P>The Latin name, <HI>Alauda,</HI> is, according to Pliny, Suetonius and Varro, of Gaulish extraction. Hence the present French term <HI>Alouette.</HI></P>
<P>In Italian, it is called <HI>Lodola, Petronella, Allodola, Alodetta.</HI></P>
<P>In Spanish, <HI>Eugniada.</HI></P>
<P>In old Saxon, <HI>Leefwere</HI> or <HI>Leeurich.</HI></P>
<P>In modern German, <HI>Heid-lerche, Sang-lerche, Himmel-lerche, Korn-lerche, Grosse-lerche, Field-lerche,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. <HI>Heath-lark, Song-lark, Sky-lark, Corn-lark, Great-lark,</HI> and <HI>Field-lark, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In Dutch, <HI>Lreurich:—</HI>in Sweden, <HI>Laerka.</HI></P>
<P>In old and provincial English, <HI>Wild-lark, Heath-lark,</HI> and <HI>Laverock.</HI></P></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THIS bird, which is now widely diffused, seems to have been a more ancient in∣habitant of Gaul than of Italy; for its Latin
<PB REF="13"/>
name, <HI>Alauda,</HI> is, according to the best informed Roman authors, of Gaulish origin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Celtic name is <HI>Alaud;</HI> whence <HI>Aloue,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Alouette,</HI> the present French name. Probably the soldiers of the legion styled <HI>Alauda,</HI> wore on their helmet a tuft something like that of the sky-lark. Schwenckfeld and Klein, who seem to have never read Pliny, derive <HI>Alauda</HI> from <HI>laus, a laude;</HI> because, according to the former, this bird rises seven times a-day to sing praises to God. It is admitted that all creatures attest the existence and glory of their Maker: but to suppose the small birds have stated hours of devotion, and to ground this inference on the ac∣cidental resemblance of words in two different languages, is a very puerile idea.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Greeks were acquainted with two spe∣cies of larks: the one wore a tuft on its head, and for that reason termed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which the Latins render <HI>Galerita</HI> or <HI>Cassita;</HI> the other, which wanted the tuft, is the subject of this article <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 25.</NOTE>. Willughby is the only author that I know, who mentions that the latter some∣times bristles the feathers on its head so as to form an occasional crest, and I have myself ascertained this fact in regard to the male; and thus it is also entitled to the epithet <HI>Galerita.</HI> The Germans call it <HI>Lerche,</HI> which in many provinces is pronounced <HI>leriche,</HI> and is obvi∣ously intended to imitate its notes <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"It prolongs its <HI>tirile, tirile, its tirile."</HI> Linnaeus, <HI>Systema.</HI></NOTE>. The Ho∣nourable Daines Barrington reckons it among
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
the best of the singing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Its song is delightful for its variety; is full of swells and falls." <HI>Olina.</HI></NOTE> larks; and as it copies the warble of every other bird <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frisch.—Schwenckfeld pretends that it sings better than the crested lark: others prefer the warble of the latter; Koempfer that of the Japanese lark, which is perhaps not of the same species. <HI>See</HI> particularly Barrington's paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1773, vol. lxiii. part 2.</NOTE>, he terms it a mocking bird: but if it lays no claim to ori∣ginality of music, the delicacy and flexibility of its organs of voice smooth and embellish whatever it imitates.</P>
<P>In the state of freedom, it commences its song early in the spring, which is its season of love, and continues to warble during the whole of the summer. It is heard most in the morn∣ing and evening, and least in the middle of the day <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus. This may be the case in the hot cli∣mates of Italy and Greece; but in our temperate climates, the sky-lark is not observed to pause at noon.</NOTE>. It is one of those few birds which chant on wing: the higher it mounts, the more it strains its voice; and when it soars beyond the range of our sight, its music still distinctly strikes our ear. Must we impute this swell to the joyous elevation of its spirits, or the throb∣bing emotions of love; or must we regard it as a sort of call, the signal of common danger? The rapacious tribes, trusting to their strength, and meditating deeds of carnage, proceed with
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
Cautious and dark silence; the little harmless birds have nothing to depend on but their numbers; and their clamorous notes may sum∣mon the stragglers together, and at least inspire a pleasing, though often a vain confidence.—The sky-lark seldom sings on the ground; where however it constantly remains, except when it flies, for it never perches on trees. It may be reckoned among the pulverent birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist.

<P>It has been fabled, that these birds have an antipathy to certain constellations; to <HI>Arcturus,</HI> for instance; and that they were silent when that star rises heliacaly <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anton. Miraldus <HI>apud Aldrovandum.</HI></NOTE>. This seems to mark the time of moulting.</P>
<P>I need not stop to describe a bird so well known: I shall only observe, that the principal characters are these: the middle toe is closely connected, by the first phalanx, to the outermost on each foot; the nail of the hind toe is very long and almost straight, the anterior nails very short and slightly curved; the bill not weak, though awl-shaped; the tongue broad, hard and forked; the nostrils round, and half bare; the stomach fleshy, and large in propor∣tion to the size of the bird; the liver di∣vided
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
into two very unequal lobes, the left one apparently checked in its growth by the pres∣sure of the stomach; the intestinal tube is nine incheslong, and two very small <HI>coeca</HI> communicate with it; there is a gall-bladder. The plumage is of a dingy cast; the tail contains twelve quills, and the wings eighteen, of which the middle-sized ones are cut almost square and notched, a character common to all the larks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brisson and Willughby.</NOTE>. I shall add, that the males are rather browner than the females <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frisch and Aldrovandus. I believe that the larks of Beauce, which are sold at Paris, are browner than those of Burgundy. Some individuals are more or less of a rust colour, and have more or less of the wing-quills edged with that colour.</NOTE>; that they have a black col∣lar, and that they have more white on the tail <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; that they have a bolder aspect, and are rather larger, though they never weigh more than two ounces; and lastly, that, as in almost all otherspecies, they exclusively possess the talent of song. Olina seems to suppose that their hind-nail is longer <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gesner affirms, that he saw one of these nails about two inches long; but he does not tell us whether the bird was a cock or a hen.</NOTE>; but I suspect, with Klein, that this depends as much upon the age as upon the sex.</P>
<P>In the opening of the vernal season, the male feels the ardour of love; he mounts into the
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
air, warbling his impassioned strains; and ranges over an extent proportioned to the number of females, till he descries his favourite, and instantly he darts to the ground, and consummates the union. The impregnated female soon proceeds to form her nest; she places it between two clods of earth, and lines it with herbs and dry roots <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fowlers say, that the lark's nest is better constructed than that of partridges and qualis.</NOTE>, and is equally careful in concealing as in building it: accordingly few nests of sky-larks are found, in comparison with the number of these birds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Description of</HI> 300 <HI>Animals.</HI></NOTE>. Each female lays four or five eggs, which are greyish, with brown spots; she sits only fifteen days at most, and employs still less time in training and educating her young. This expedition has often deceived persons who in∣tended to rob the nestlings, and Aldrovandus among the rest <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tom. ii. p. 834.</NOTE>. The same circumstance ren∣ders probable what Aldrovandus and Olina as∣sert, that she has three hatches in the year; the first, in the beginning of May; the second, in the month of July; and the last, in the month of August: but if this take place, it must be in the warm countries, where incubation is more forward, where the young are sooner eman∣cipated, and where the mother is soon in a con∣dition to renew her loves. In fact, Aldrovan∣dus
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
and Olina wrote in the climate of Italy; but Frisch, whose observations apply to Ger∣many, mentions only two hatches annually; and Schwenckfeld takes notice of one only in Silesia.</P>
<P>The young keep at a little distance from each other; for the mother does not always gather them under her wings. She flutters over their heads, watches them with a truly maternal affection, directing their motions, an∣ticipating their wants, and guarding them from danger.</P>
<P>The instinctive warmth of attachment which the female sky-lark bears to her young, often discovers itself at a very early period; and even before she is capable of discharging the functions of a mother, which might be sup∣posed to precede, in the order of nature, the maternal solicitude. A young hen-bird was brought to me in the month of May, which was not able to feed without assistance; I caused it to be educated, and it was hardly fledged when I received, from another place, a nest of three or four callow sky-larks. She took a strong liking to these new-comers, which were scarcely younger than herself; she tended them night and day, cherished them beneath her wings, and fed them with her bill. Nothing could divert her tender offices: if the young were torn from her, she flew back to them as soon as she was liberated, and would not think
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
of effecting her own escape, which she might have done an hundred times. Her affection grew upon her; she neglected food and drink; she now required the same support as her adopt∣ed offspring, and expired at last, consumed with maternal anxiety. None of the young ones survived her; they died one after another: so essential were her cares, which were equally tender and judicious.</P>
<P>The most common food of the young sky-larks is worms, caterpillars, ants eggs, and even grasshoppers; which has justly procured them much regard in countries subject to the ravages of these destructive insects <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch <HI>de Iside.</HI></NOTE>. After they are grown up, they live chiefly on seeds, herbage, and in short, on all vegetable substances.</P>
<P>It is said, that those destined for song, should be caught in October or November, the males being preferred as much as possible <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; and when they are furious and untractable, they must be pinioned, lest they dart with too great violence against the roof of the cage, and break their skull. They are easily tamed, and become so familiar that they will eat off the table, and even alight on the hand; but they cannot cling by the toes, on account of the form of the hind toe, which is too long and straight. This is undoubtedly the reason why they never perch
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
on trees.—It is easy to infer, that there ought to be no bars laid across their cage.</P>
<P>In Flanders, the young ones are fed with moistened poppy-seeds; and after they can eat without assistance, they are presented with crumbs of bread, likewise soaked: but when they be∣gin to sing, they are given sheeps' and calves' hearts hashed with hard eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; and to this are added, wheat, spelt, and oats previously cleaned, millet, linseed, and the seeds of poppy and hemp, the whole being steeped in milk <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Olina<HI>—Description of</HI> 300 <HI>Animals—</HI>Frisch.</NOTE>. Frisch tells us, that when they subsist on bruised hemp-seed alone, their plumage is apt to turn black. It is also said, that mustard-seed is improper food for them; but except this, they may be fed with every other sort of farinaceous seed, and even every thing used at our tables, and become in some degree domestic birds. According to Frisch, they have a singular instinct of tasting with their tongue, before they venture to swallow.—They may be taught to sing, and to heighten their native warble with all the embellishments which our music can bestow. Some cock-larks, after hearing a tune whistled with the pipe, have caught the whole, and repeated it more agreeably than any linnet or canary.—Those which remain in the wild state, inhabit, during
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
the summer, the highest and driest situations; and in winter, they descend into the plains, and assemble in numerous flocks. In that season they are very fat, for then they are almost al∣ways on the ground, and perpetually feeding. In summer, on the contrary, they are very lean: then they always go in pairs, eat sparingly, sing incessantly, and never alight but to hold the dalliance of love. During severe weather, par∣ticularly when much snow has fallen, they re∣sort to the margins of the springs, where the frost does not prevail; in such seasons, they crop the grass, and are even obliged to seek their food among the horse-dung which is dropt on the high roads: yet notwithstanding, they are still fatter than in any part of the summer.</P>
<P>They mount in the air almost perpendicularly, and by successive springs, and hover at a vast height. They descend to the ground, on the contrary, by an oblique sweep, unless they are threatened by a ravenous bird, or attracted by a beloved mate, and in these cases they drop like a stone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive, that these small birds, which soar so lofty, may be carried sometimes far to sea by a gust of wind, or even be wafted across the ocean. "As soon as we approach the European coasts, says Father Dutertre, we be∣gin
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
to see birds of prey, larks, and goldfinches, which are driven off from the land, and are glad to rest on the masts and cordage of the vessels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. des Antilles,</HI> t. ii. p. 55.</NOTE>." Hence Sir Hans Sloane saw them forty miles at sea, and the Count Marsigli met with them on the Mediterranean. It is even probable, that those which are found in Penn∣sylvania, Virginia, and other parts of America, have been driven thither the same way. The Chevalier des Mazis informs me, that the larks pass the island of Malta in the month of November; and though he does not specify the particular kinds, the sky-lark is probably one of them: for Lottinger has observed, that a considerable flight of sky-larks into Lorraine, ceases exactly at this time; and that as those bred in the coun∣try join the train of their visitors, few stay be∣hind; but that shortly after, the usual numbers again appear, whether that others succeed to their place, or that they return back, which is the more probable supposition. However, it is certain that they do not entirely migrate, since they are found at all seasons in our pro∣vince; and considerable numbers of them are caught in Beauce, Picardy, and many other parts, during winter. It is indeed the general opinion, in these places, that they are not birds of passage. If they be absent for a few days during the excessive cold weather, especially
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
after long continued snow, it is often because they retire under some rock or some sheltered cave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the part of Bugey situated at the foot of the moun∣tains between the Rhône and the Dain, an innumerable multitude of sky-larks are often seen about the end of Octo∣ber, or the beginning of November, for the space of a fort∣night. During the intense cold which prevailed the last fortnight of January 1776, there appeared in the neigh∣bourhood of Pont-de-Beauvoisin, such prodigious quantities of sky-larks, that one person with a pole killed as many as would load two mules. They took shelter in the houses, and were excessively lean. It is evident from these two cases, that the larks did not quit their ordinary residence for want of food; but still we cannot absolutely infer that they are not birds of passage. Thevenot says, that the larks appear in Egypt in the month of September, and continue there till the end of the year. <HI>Voyage du Levant,</HI> t. i. p. 493.</NOTE>, as I have already said they haunt the perennial springs. Frequently it happens that they suddenly disappear in the spring, when the mild gleams which drew them from their retreats, are succeeded by frosts or storms, that drive them back. This temporary concealment of the lark was known to Aristotle <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. viii. 16. "The stork hides itself, and the blackbird, and the turtle, and the lark."</NOTE>, and Klein assures us that he ascertained the fact from his own experience <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird is found in all the inhabited parts of both continents, and as far as the Cape of Good Hope, according to Kolben <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voyages, t. iv. p. 243.</NOTE>. It could even subsist amidst uncultivated tracts over∣spread
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
with heath and junipers; for it is ex∣ceedingly fond of these shrubs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Turner and Longolius <HI>in Gesner.</HI></NOTE>, which shelter itself and its infant brood from the attacks of the birds of prey. If the sky-lark accommo∣dates itself with such facility to every situation and every climate, it seems rather singular that the bird is not found in the Gold-coast, according to Villault, nor even in Andalusia, if we credit Averroes.</P>
<P>Every person knows the various contrivan∣ces for catching larks; the noose, the trammel, the springe, the draw-net, &amp;c; but the engine most commonly employed, is what is called the <HI>lark-net.</HI> A cool morning gladdened by a bright sun, is chosen for the sport; a mirror that turns freely on its pivots is provided, and a pair of sky-larks are used as calls; for it is impossible to imitate their song so closely as to deceive them, and hence they listen to no artificial sub∣stitute. But they seem the most attracted by the mirror; not indeed to admire their image, as some have supposed, on account of the in∣stinct which they have in common with almost all the other birds which are capable of being tamed, viz. that of singing with redoubled vi∣vacity and emulation before a glass: their curiosity is raised by the dazzling glare which beams from every quarter as the mirror turns round; they perhaps mistake it for the undu∣lating
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
surface of the crystal fountain, which in that season has to them its peculiar charms. Accordingly great numbers are caught every winter near the tepid springs, which they haunt. But the most successful sport is that with lime-twigs, as practised in French Lor∣raine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Sonini has long practised this mode of fowling in his estate of Manoncour in Lorraine. The late king Stanis∣laus was fond of it, and often honoured it with his presence.</NOTE>, and in other parts; and which, because it is little known, I shall particularly describe. For this purpose, 1500 or 2000 willow-rods of about three feet ten inches long are provided, very straight, or at least well smoothed; these are sharpened at one of the ends, and even slightly burnt, and the space of about a foot from the other end is spread with bird-lime. The stakes are planted in parallel rows, in a pro∣per situation, commonly in fallow-ground, that is likely to harbour a sufficient number of larks to defray the expence, which is considerable. The rows ought to be as wide as to admit a person to pass easily between them; and each stake should be a foot distant from the next one, and placed opposite to the interval in the adja∣cent row. The art consists in planting these with great regularity, and quite perpendicular, and so that they shall retain their position as long as they are not touched, but yet so ticklish that they shall fall the instant a lark brushes against them in its flight.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="26"/>
After all these limed-rods are planted, an oblong square is traced, which presents one of its sides to the ground where the larks are lodged; and at each corner a flag is fixed, which serves the fowlers as a mark, and sometimes as a signal for their manoeuvres. The number of persons em∣ployed must be proportioned to the extent of the field.—About four or five o'clock in the afternoon, according as the autumn is more or less advanced, the company divides into two equal detachments, each conducted by an intelligent leader, who is likewise subject to the direc∣tion of the commander in chief, whose sta∣tion is in the centre. The one detachment assembles at the flag on the right, the other at the one on the left; and each observing the most profound silence, extends itself in an arch, so that they meet at the distance of half a league from the front, and then form one rank, which gra∣dually closes as it advances to the rods, and con∣tinually drives the larks before it. About sun∣set, the middle of the line ought not to be far∣ther than two or three hundred paces from the front; and this is the time when they <HI>charge</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In French, <HI>Donne.</HI></NOTE>, that is, they proceed cautiously, stop, or lie flat on the ground, rise up or push forward, according to the commands of their leader: and if all these manoeuvres are well executed and properly directed, the greatest part of the larks
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
inclosed by the troop, and which now mount no higher than three or four feet, rush forward, and are caught among the limed rods; and fall∣ing to the ground with these, they can be picked up by the hand. If it is not too late, a second line is made on the opposite side, at the distance of fifty paces, which drives back the larks that had escaped; and is called <HI>tacking about</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In French, <HI>Revirer.</HI></NOTE>. The idle spectators are detained a little behind the flags, to avoid confusion.</P>
<P>An hundred dozen of larks or more are sometimes caught in one of these sweeps, and it is reckoned very bad sport when only twenty-five dozen are got. Coveys of partridges, and even owls, are also led sometimes into the snare; but such accidents are regarded as vex∣atious, since they scare away the larks. A hare likewise which happens to cross the field, or any sudden or uncommon noise, spoils the sport.</P>
<P>Many of the sky-larks are also destroyed in summer by the voracious tribes; for they are the ordinary prey of even the smallest of these: and the cuckoo, which has no nest of its own, frequently substitutes its eggs in the place of theirs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The cuckoo breeds in strangers' nests, especially in those of the ring-pigeon, of the petty-chaps, and of the ground-lark." <HI>Hist. Nat. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 24.</NOTE>. Yet notwithstanding the havock which is made among them, they are extremely nu∣merous;
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
which proves their great fecundity, and adds to the probability of the assertion, that they have three hatches annually. For so small an animal, the sky-lark is long-lived; the term being ten years, according to Olina; twelve, according to others; twenty-two, ac∣cording to the account of a person of veracity; and even twenty-four, if we believe Rzacynski.</P>
<P>The ancients pretended that the flesh of the lark, boiled, roasted, or even burnt and reduced to ashes, was a sort of specific in the colic. On the contrary, some modern observations shew that it often occasions that disorder, and Lin∣naeus judges it improper food for persons af∣flicted with gravelly complaints. The most probable account is, that this meat is very wholesome and pleasant when fat; and that the pains in the stomach, or gripes in the bowels, which are sometimes felt after eating, are owing to some portions of their small bones that have been inadvertently swallowed, and which are very minute and very sharp. The weight of the bird varies, according to the quantity of the fat, from seven or eight gros to ten or twelve.</P>
<P>Total length, about seven inches; the bill, six or seven lines; the hind nail straight, and mea∣sures ten lines; the alar extent, twelve or thir∣teen inches: the tail, two inches and three quar∣ters, a little forked, consisting of twelve quills, and exceeding the wings by twelve lines. <NOTE PLACE="foot">(A) Specific character of the Field or Sky Lark, <HI>Alauda Arvensis:</HI> "The two outermost quills of its tail are white lengthwise externally, the intermediate ones are ferruginous on the inside." Mr. Pennant tells us, that in the neigh∣bourhood of Dunstable four thousand dozens of larks are usually caught for the London market, between the fourteenth of September and the twenty-fifth of February. In fine wea∣ther, the larkers use clap-nets with bits of mirror and a decoy: at other times, they employ a trammel net and a pointer dog.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the SKY-LARK.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE WHITE SKY-LARK. Brisson and Frisch properly consider this as a variety of the foregoing species. In fact, it is a true sky-lark, which according to Frisch comes from the north, like the white sparrow and stare, the white swallow and petty-chaps, &amp;c. in all which the plumage retains the impression of their natal climate. Klein rejects this opinion, because at Dantzic, which is situated farther north than the countries where white larks some∣times appear, not one has been found in the course of half a century. If I were to decide this point, I should say that the assertion of
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
Frisch, that all the white larks arrive from the boreal tracts, is too general, and that the ob∣jection which Klein makes is by no means conclusive. In fact, observations evince that white larks are found in other countries besides those of the north; but it is obvious that from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, they could more easily enter the western part of Germany, which is separated from these countries by only a narrow sea, than cross the Baltic, and reach the mouth of the Vistula and the coasts of Prussia.—At any rate, besides the white larks sometimes found near Berlin according to Frisch, they are often seen in the vicinity of Hildesheim in Lower Saxony. They are seldom of a snowy white; the subject examined by Brisson was tinged with yellow; but the bill, the feet, and the nails were entirely white.—At the very time when I was writing this article, a white lark was brought to me, which was shot under the walls of the little town where I live: the crown of the head and some parts of the body were of the ordinary colour; the rest of the upper surface, including the tail and the wings, was variegated with brown and white; most of the plumage and even the quills were edged with white; the under part of the body was white, speckled with brown, especially the fore part, and the right side; the lower mandible whiter than the upper, and the feet of a dirty white, variegated with brown. This subject
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
seemed to form the intermediate shade between the common lark and that which is of a pure white.</P>
<P>I have since seen another lark whose plumage was perfectly white, except on the head, where there were some traces of a grey but half effaced. It was found in the neighbourhood of Mont∣bard. It is not likely that either this or the other lark came from the northern shores of the Baltic.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE BLACK SKY-LARK. I join Brisson in considering this as a variety of the common sky-lark; whether we are to impute it to the bird's feeding on hemp-seed, or to any other cause. The subject which I have directed to be engraved was of a rufous brown at the rise of the back, and its feet of a light brown.</P>
<P>Albin, who saw and described this bird from nature, represents it entirely of a dull brown and reddish, verging to black; except however the back of the head, which is of a dun yellow, and below the belly, where there are some fea∣thers edged with white; the feet, the toes, and the nails were of a dirty yellow. The subject from which Albin formed his description was caught with a net in a meadow near Highgate; and it appears that there such birds are seldom met with.</P>
<P>Mauduit assures me that he saw a lark which was perfectly black, and had been caught in the plain of Mont-rouge near Paris.</P>

<P>HAD not this bird been brought by Com∣merson from Buenos-Ayres; were it not much smaller than our common sky-lark, and a native of a very different climate, the resem∣blance of its plumage is so striking that we could not help considering it as only a variety of the preceding species. The head, the bill, the feet, the throat, the fore part of the neck, and all the under surface of the body, are of a blackish brown; the quills of the wings and of the tail are of a somewhat lighter shade; the outermost of these last are edged with rufous; the hind part of the tail, the back, and the shoulders, are of an orange fulvous; the small and middle coverts of the wings blackish, edged also with fulvous.</P>

<P>I CONCEIVE this bird to differ so much from the common lark as to constitute a distinct species. It is distinguished by its size and its general form, being shorter, rounder, and much smaller, not weighing more than an ounce: by its plumage, whose colours are more dilute, less mixed with white, and its whitish crown is more conspicuous than in the ordinary species: by the dimensions too of its wing quills, the first and outermost being half an inch shorter than the rest. It is discriminated from the sky-lark also by its habits: it perches on trees, though only indeed on the thick branches, because the length of its hind too, or rather the projection and slight curvature of the nail, will not permit it to cling to the twigs: it haunts
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
the uncultivated tracts near copses, or even the verge of young copses; and hence the name of <HI>wood-lark,</HI> though it never penetrates into the woods. Its song too resembles more the war∣ble of the nightingale than that of the sky∣lark <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina and Albin.</NOTE>; and is heard not only in the day, but, like the former, in the night; both when it flutters on the wing and when it sits on a bough. Hebert observes, that the fifers of the Swiss guards imitate well its notes; hence I conclude, that this bird is common among the moun∣tains of Switzerland <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I am informed that it actually frequents the highest meadows in Switzerland.</NOTE>, as in those of Bugey. Its fecundity is inferior to that of the sky-lark; for, though it also lays four or five eggs, and is not so much destroyed, because smaller and less valued, yet its numbers are not so great <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.</NOTE>. It breeds earlier, since its young are sometimes flown in the middle of March <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>, whereas the common lark does not hatch before the month of May. It is besides more delicate; for, ac∣cording to Albin, it is impossible to rear the young taken out of the nest. But this holds only in regard to England, and other similar or colder climates; and Olina positively asserts, that in Italy the young are removed from the
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>
nest and raised at first like the nightingale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby remarks, that the song of the wood-lark re∣sembles that of the blackbird.</NOTE>, and afterwards fed upon panic and millet.</P>
<P>In every other property the wood-lark bears a close analogy to the sky-lark. It mounts high, warbling its notes, and hovers in the air: it flies in flocks during the winter colds: it builds its nest on the ground, and conceals it under a turf: it lives ten or twelve years: it feeds on beetles, caterpillars, and seeds: its tongue is forked; its stomach muscular and fleshy: and it has no craw, but a moderate di∣latation of the lower part of the <HI>oesophagus:</HI> its <HI>caeca</HI> are very small <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Olina remarks that, in the male, the crown of the head is darker than in the female, and its hind nail longer. He might have also added, that its breast is more spotted, and its great wing quills edged with olive, while, in the female, they are bordered with gray. He subjoins, that the wood-lark is caught in the same manner as the sky-lark, which is true; but he pretends that this species is hardly known out of the Pope's territories, which is justly controverted by the best informed modern naturalists. In fact, it would seem that the wood-lark is not confined to any one country:
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
it is found in Sweden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE> and Italy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>, and is probably spread through the intervening coun∣tries, and consequently scattered over the greatest part of Europe <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>.—The wood-lark is pretty fat in autumn, and is then excellent meat.</P>
<P>Albin says, that there are three seasons for catching the wood-larks. The first is in the sum∣mer, when the small branchers begin to chirp, before they undergo the moulting.—The se∣cond is in the month of September, when they fly in flocks, and roam from one country to another, roving over the pasture grounds, and perching on trees near lime-kilns <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Kramer.</NOTE>. At this time the young birds change their plumage, and are no longer to be distinguished from the old ones.—The third season, and the most fa∣vourable for catching the wood-larks, begins with the month of January <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">M. Hebert killed these birds during winter in Brie, in Picardy, and in Burgundy: he remarked that, during this season, they are found on the ground in the plains, that they are pretty common in Bugey, and still more so in Burgundy. On the other hand, M. Lottinger asserts that they arrive about the end of February, and retire in the beginning of October. But these opposite accounts might be reconciled, if of these larks, as of the common sort, some are migratory and others stationary.</NOTE>, and lasts till the end of February, when they separate to pair. The young birds which are then caught, make

<P>BELON and Olina mention this as the smallest of all the larks; but they were unacquainted with the grashopper-lark, of which we shall afterwards speak. The tit-lark weighs six or seven gros, and its alar extent is only nine inches. The prevailing colour of its upper surface is olive, variegated with black on the fore part, and pure olive behind. Its under surface is yellowish white, with black longitudinal spots on the breast and the sides, and the ground colour of the plumage is black. The quills of the wings are almost black, edged with olive; and those of the tail are similar, ex∣cept the outermost one, which is edged with white, and the one next it, which is tipt with the same colour.</P>
<P>This bird has a sort of white eyelids, which
<PB REF="41"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE TIT-LARK.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
Linnaeus adopts as its specific character.—The male has in general more yellow than the female, on the throat, on the breast, on the legs, and even on the feet, according to Albin.</P>
<P>The tit-lark is flushed at the least noise, and shoots with a rapid flight; it perches, though with difficulty, on trees; it constructs its nest nearly as the wood-lark, and lays the same number of eggs, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.</NOTE> But, what distinguishes it, the first quill in its wing is equal to the rest, and its song, though very pleasant, is less varied. Mr. Pennant compares this to a jeering laugh, and Albin, to the warble of the canary finch; but both complain that it is too short and broken. However, Belon and Olina agree that this small bird is esteemed for the sweetness of its song; and I must own, that having occa∣sion to hear it I found it really agreeable, though rather plaintive, and similar to the nightingale's strain, yet not so full and connected. It de∣serves to be noticed that this one was a female, since, in dissecting it, I discovered an <HI>ovarium:</HI> it contained three eggs that were larger than the rest, which seemed to promise a second hatch. Olina tells us that the tit-lark is raised in the same way as the nightingale, but its delicacy renders the success extremely precarious; and, as it lives only three or four years, we readily
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
perceive the reason why the species is unfre∣quent, and why the male, when he mounts into the air to descry his mate, is obliged to sweep a much wider circuit than the common lark, or even the wood-lark. Albin indeed pretends that it is long-lived, little subject to diseases, and lays five or six eggs: but if this were true, the number would be much greater.</P>
<P>According to M. Guys, the tit-lark feeds chiefly upon the worms and insects for which it searches in new-ploughed lands. Willughby actually found beetles and small worms in its stomach; and I have myself seen in it portions of insects and of small worms, and also seeds and pebbles. If we believe Albin, it wags its tail from side to side while it eats.</P>
<P>The tit-larks breed generally in the mea∣dows, and even in low and marshy grounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.</NOTE>. They make their nest on the surface <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon.—British Zoology.</NOTE>, and conceal it artfully. While the female hatches, the male sits on a neighbouring tree, and rises at times, singing and clapping his wings.</P>
<P>Willughby, who seems to have observed this bird with great accuracy, says properly that its iris is hazel, the tip of its tongue divided into several filaments, its stomach moderately fleshy, its <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eca</HI> rather longer than in the sky-lark,
<PB N="31" REF="44"/>
and that it has a gall-bladder. All this I have verified; and I shall add that there is no craw, and that even the <HI>oesophagus</HI> has scarce any in∣flation at its junction with the stomach, and that this stomach or gizzard is large in propor∣tion to the body.—I kept one of these birds a whole year, and gave it no other food than small seeds.</P>
<P>The tit-lark inhabits Italy, France, Germany, England, and Sweden. Albin tells us that it ap∣pears (in that part of England, no doubt, where he lived) about the beginning of April with the nightingale, and that it departs about the month of September. It sometimes begins its flight before the close of August, according to Lottinger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Lottinger only once saw a tit-lark in Lorraine, in the month of February 1774. But, that same winter, he saw other birds which do not usually remain in that pro∣vince, such as green-finches, wagtails, &amp;c. which M. Lot∣tinger ascribes properly to the mildness of that year.</NOTE>, and seems to perform a long jour∣ney. If this be admitted, and if we suppose that it makes occasional halts in the temperate countries which it traverses, it may be among the number of those larks which are seen to pass the island of Malta in November. In au∣tumn, that is, in the time of vintage, it haunts the vicinity of the high-roads. M. Guys re∣marks that it is exceedingly fond of the com∣pany of its fellows; and if it cannot obtain the
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
society of these, it will intermingle with the flocks of finches and linnets which it meets in its passage.</P>
<P>Comparing what authors have said of the tit. lark, I perceive differences which dispose one to think that the species is much subject to vary, or that it has been sometimes confounded with its kindred species, such as those of the wood-lark and the grashopper-lark <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The disposition of the spots on the plumage is nearly the same in the three species, though the colours of these spots are different in each, and the habits still more different; but less so, however, than the opinions of authors concerning the properties of the tit-lark. We need only compare Belon, Aldrovandus, Brisson, Olina, Albin, &amp;c. The co∣lours by which Brisson characterises the species are not the same with those described by Aldrovandus; who takes no notice of the long hind toe, but speaks of a certain motion of the tail, which the others, except Albin, omit. The latter pretends that the tit-lark is long-lived, and little subject to diseases. Olina and Belon, on the contrary, assert that it is difficult to be raised; Olina positively asserts that it is short∣lived. We need not mention their various opinions respect∣ing its song.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I SAW this bird at M. Mauduit's, and it seems to resemble much the tit-lark. Its throat is of a yellowish grey; the neck and breast streaked with brown on the same ground: the rest of the under surface of its body is fulvous: the upper surface of its head and of its body is mixed with greenish brown, and with blackish; but as these colours are dingy, they contrast little with each other, and by their mixture they for man almost uniform dull brown: the superior coverts are greenish brown with no addition: the quills of the tail are brown; the outermost one con∣sists of blackish brown and white, the white being turned outwards, and the next quill tipt with white: the quills and the superior coverts of the wings are of a blackish brown, edged with lighter brown.</P>

<P>THIS is the smallest of all the French larks. The German epithet <HI>piep</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The German name <HI>Piep-lerche</HI> is formed from the Latin <HI>pipio,</HI> which signifies to utter a feeble shrill cry like chickens.

Its cry, especially in winter, is compared to that of the grashopper; but is rather stronger and shriller. It utters this both when on the wing, and when perched on the tallest branches among the bushes: for though its hind nail be very long (yet not so long or so straight as that

of the sky-lark), it sits on the small twigs, clasp∣ing with its fore claws. It also rests on the ground, and runs very nimbly.</P>
<P>In the spring, when the cock bird sings on a branch, he performs it with much action: he looks big, displays his wings, and gives every mark of ardent emotion. At intervals he rises to a considerable height, hovers some seconds, and drops almost in the same place, continuing all the time to sing; and his tones are soft, har∣monious, and clear.—This little bird builds its nest in solitary spots, and conceals it beneath a turf; and its young often become the prey of the adders. It generally lays five eggs, marked with brown near the large end. Its head is rather long than round; its bill delicate and blackish; the edges of its upper mandible scalloped near the tip; its nostrils half covered by a convex membrane of the same colour with the bill, and partly concealed under the small feathers which cover it before: there are sixteen quills in each wing; the upper surface of its body is of a greenish variegated brown; the un∣der surface, of a yellowish white, speckled ir∣regularly on the breast and neck: the ground colour of its plumage is deep cinereous: lastly, there are two whitish stripes on the wings, which Linnaeus has made one of the characters of the species.</P>

<P>THIS bird is rather larger than the tit∣lark. Its hind toe is very long, as that of the sky-lark, but its body is slenderer: it is also distinguished by the shake of its tail, similar to that of the wagtail and of the tit-lark. It inhabits heaths and uncultivated tracts, and fre∣quents the oat-stubble soon after the corn is reaped, where it gathers in numerous flocks.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="58"/>
In spring, the male perches to invite or to discover his mate; and sometimes he mounts into the air, singing with all his might, and again returns quickly to the ground, which is always the scene of their amours.</P>
<P>If a person happens to come near the nest, the female betrays it by her cries; and this evinces a different instinct from that of the other larks, which, when danger threatens, remain silent and fixed.</P>
<P>Willughby saw a nest of the meadow-lark in a furze-bush close on the ground; and formed of moss, lined with straw and horse-hair.</P>
<P>People have had the curiosity to raise the young males for the sake of their song; but it requires attention and care. The cage must at first be covered with a green cloth, little light must be admitted, and a profusion of ants' eggs must be furnished. After they are accustomed to feed in their prison, the supply of the ants' eggs may be abridged by degrees, and bruised hemp-seed substituted, mixed with flour and yolks of eggs.</P>
<P>The meadow-larks are caught with the drag-net, like the sky-larks, and also with lime-twigs, which are placed in the trees which they haunt. They associate with the finches; and it appears even that they arrive and depart along with these.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="59"/>
The males are hardly to be distinguished from the females by their exterior appearance; but if another male be presented shut in a cage, they will instantly attack it, as an enemy or a rival <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Willughby says, that the meadow-lark differs from all the other larks by the blackness of its bill and feet: he adds, that its bill is slender, straight, and pointed, and the corners of its mouth edged with yellow; that it has not, like the wood-lark, the first quills of the wings shorter than the succeeding; and that in the male the wings are rather darker than in the female.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Italy, Germany, Eng∣land, Sweden, &amp;c. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus and Willughby.</NOTE> Brisson considers the Jessop meadow-lark as the same species with his, though the hind nail is much longer in the latter; but that nail varies much according to age, sex, &amp;c. There is a wider difference between the meadow-lark of Brisson and that of Linnaeus, though both naturalists regard them as the same kind: in that of the latter, all the quills of the tail, except the two middle ones, are white srom their origin to half their length; but in that of the former, the two outermost quills only are white; not to mention many other
<PB N="44" REF="60"/>
minute differences, which taken together are sufficient to constitute a variety.</P>
<P>The meadow-larks live on small seeds and insects. Their flesh, when fat, is excellent.—The head and all the upper surface of the body are dun grey, tinged with olive; the eye-brows, the throat, and all the under surface of the body are yellowish white, with brown oblong spots on the neck and breast; the quills and coverts of the wings, brown, edged with lighter brown; the quills of the tail blackish, except the two in∣termediate ones, which are brown gray, the outermost edged with white, and the next one tipt with the same: lastly, the bill is blackish, and the feet brown.</P>

<P>BRISSON suspects, with much probability, that the subject observed by Aldrovandus was a young bird, whose tail, being extremely short and consisting of very narrow feathers, was not entirely formed, and in which the junction of the mandibles was edged with yel∣low. But I should imagine he ought to have drawn another inference besides, that it was only a variety of the common species derived from age, since Aldrovandus, the only author who mentions it, saw no more than one speci∣men. Its size was the same with that of the sky-lark, and it had the chief character, which is the long nail projecting from each foot. The plumage of the head and of the upper side of the body was variegated with chesnut, with lighter brown, with whitish, and with bright rufous. Aldrovandus compares it to that of the quail, or of the woodcock. The under
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
surface of the body was white; the back of the head encircled with a sort of whitish crown; the quills of the wings brown chesnut, edged with a lighter colour; those of the tail, at least the four middle ones, of the same colour; the pair following, divided by chesnut and white; and the last pair entirely white; the tail some∣what forked, and an inch long; the ground colour of the plumage cinereous; the bill red, with a large opening; the corners of the mouth yellow; the feet flesh-coloured; the nails whitish; the hind nail six lines in length, al∣most straight, and only a little curved at the tip.</P>
<P>This bird was killed near Bologna, about the end of May. I wish those naturalists who have an opportunity of observing it, would refer it to its true species; for I much doubt whether it forms a separate species. Ray supposed that it belonged to that of the wood-lark, and differ∣ing only in the colours of its tail quills; but it is equal to the sky-lark, and consequently much larger than the wood-lark; and if with Brisson we reckon it a young bird, this distinction will be the more important. <NOTE PLACE="foot">(A) Specific character of the <HI>Alauda Italica:</HI> "Its middle tail quills are bay, the last but one white at the tip, the two outermost entirely white."</NOTE></P>

<P>OPPIAN, who lived in the second century of the Christian aera, is the first of the ancients who mentions this lark; and he de∣scribes the best method for catching it, which is precisely the same as that since proposed by Olina, viz. to spread a net near the brook whither that bird usually resorts to drink.</P>
<P>This bird is larger than the sky-lark; its bill is stronger and shorter, so that it is able to bruise grain; and the species is less numerous, and not so widely spread. In other respects, the calandre resembles exactly the ordinary lark. Its plumage, its port, its shape, its habits, and its tones, are the same. Its warble is perhaps more sonorous than that of the sky-lark, but is as pleasant <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; for, in Italy, it is an usual

<P>To have good singers, we must, according to Olina, take the young calandres from the nest, at least before the first moult, and preferring those especially which are hatched in August. We begin with a paste mixed partly with sheep's heart, and afterwards add seeds and crumbs of bread, taking care always to lay rubbish in the cage for whetting their bill, and also sand for them to welter in when teased with vermin. But, in spite of all our attention, we shall derive little pleasure the first year; for the calandre is slowly fashioned into habits of slavery. In the beginning, we should even pinion their wings, and instead of the top of the cage we should substitute a spread canvass <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>.

But this method is not certain except in the season of hatching. <HI>Gesner.</HI></NOTE>. Some instead of a collar have a large black space, and such was the one that we have figured.—The calandre nestles on the ground like the common lark, under a grassy tuft, and lays four or five eggs. Olina adds, that it lives only four or five years, and consequently is far from gaining the age of the sky-lark. Belon conjectures that it forms flocks like the last, and subjoins that it is never seen in France, unless it be brought hither: but this assertion relates only to Mans and the contiguous provinces; for the species is frequent in Provence, where it is called <HI>coulassade</HI> on account of its black collar, and where it is usually bred for the sake of its song. With regard to Germany, Poland, Swe∣den, and the other northern countries, it seems not to visit them. It is found in Italy, in the Pyrenees, and in Sardinia; and lastly, Dr. Rus∣sel informed Edwards, that it was common near Aleppo; and Edwards gives a coloured figure

<P>I RANGE this American lark beside the preceding, to which it is much akin: it differs however by its climate, by its magnitude, and by some accidents of its plumage. It some∣times enters Germany in the time of snow; for which reason, Frisch terms it <HI>the winter lark.</HI> But we must not confound it with the <HI>lulu,</HI> which, according to Gesner, might bear the same appellation, since it appears when the ground is buried with snow. Frisch says that it is little known in Germany, and that the place of its retreat is not ascertained.</P>
<P>These shore-larks are also caught sometimes in the neighbourhood of Dantzic, with other birds, in the months of April and December, and one of them lived several months in a cage. Klein presumes that they had been driven by a gust of wind from North America into Nor∣way, or the countries still nearer the pole, whence they would easily pass into milder climates.</P>
<P>It appears too that they are birds of passage:
<PB N="54" REF="70"/>
for we learn from Catesby, that they are seen in Virginia and Carolina only in winter, ad∣vancing from the north in great flocks; and that in the spring they return by the same route. During their stay they frequent the downs, and feed upon the oat which grows among the sand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Uniola Panicula,</HI> Linn.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This lark is of the bulk of the ordinary sort, and its song is nearly the same. The upper side of its body is brown; its bill black; its eyes placed on a yellow bar that rises from the base of its bill; its throat and the rest of its neck of the same colour; and this yellow is partly ter∣minated on each side by a black bar, which, rising from the corners of the mouth, passes under the eyes, and reaches the middle of the neck; it is terminated below the neck by a sort of collar or black gorget: the breast and all the under side of the body are of a deep straw colour.</P>
<P>Total length, six inches and a half; the bill, seven lines; the hind toe and nail still longer than in our lark; the tail, two inches and a half, a little forked, composed of twelve quills, and exceeding the wings ten or twelve lines. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Alauda Alpestris:</HI> "Its tail quills are white the half of their inside; its throat yel∣low; the stripe under its eyes, and on its breast, black."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS is a migratory lark common to both continents: for Bartram, who sent the specimen to Edwards, wrote, that it appears in Pennsylvania in the month of March, and is not seen after the end of May, but advances northward; and, on the other hand, Edwards found it in the vicinity of London.</P>
<P>This bird is of the size of the meadow-lark: its bill is thin, pointed, and of a deep brown colour: its eyes brown, edged with a lighter tint, and surrounded by an oval brown spot, which de∣scends on the cheeks, and bounded by a zone, which is partly white and partly bright fulvous. All the upper side of its body is dull brown, ex∣cept the two outer quills of its tail, which are white; its neck, its breast, and all the under side of its body, of a reddish fulvous speckled with brown: its feet and nails are deep brown, like its bill: its hind nail is very long, but not quite so long as in the sky-lark. A peculiarity
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>
of this species is, that when the wing is closed, the third quill reckoning from the body reaches the end of the longest quills; which, according to Edwards, is an invariable character of the wagtails. But this is not the only point of analogy between the larks and the wagtails; for we have before seen that the meadow and tit-larks have a similar shake in their tails. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Alauda Rubra:</HI> "It is brown, the space about its eyes black, its two outermost tail quills white."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS lark, which is found in Alsace, is of a middle size between the sky-lark and the tit-lark. The upper part of its head and body is varied with rufous and brown; the sides of the head, rusty, marked with three brown stripes that are almost parallel, and of which the highest passes below the eye: the throat is of a very light rufous; the breast of a deeper rufous, and sprinkled with little brown spots; the belly, and the lower coverts of the tail, light rufous; the quills of the tail and wings blackish, and edged with the same ru∣sous; the bill and feet yellowish.</P>
<P>Like many other species of this kind, the marsh-lark begins its song at dawn, which, ac∣cording to Rzacynski, is exceedingly pleasant. Its name shews that it haunts wet situations: it often frequents the sandy margin of the Moselle, and sometimes breeds on its banks,

<P>THE crest is, according to Belon, com∣posed of four large feathers; but Olina says there are four or six, and others increase the number even to twelve <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Naturalists agree no better with regard to its position and struc∣ture: some assert that it is always erect <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Turner.</NOTE>; others allege that the bird raises or depresses it, con∣tracts
<PB N="66" REF="83"/>
or expands it, at pleasure <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Brisson.</NOTE>: nor can we decide whether this difference ought to be im∣puted to the climate, as Turner hints, or to the age, the sex, or other modifying causes.</P>
<P>The crested lark is a bird of little timidity, says Belon, which seems pleased at the sight of man, and begins to sing when he comes near it. It lives in the meadows and fields, on the sides of ditches and the backs of furrows: it is often seen at the margin of water, and on the high-roads, where it picks its subsistence from the horse-dung, especially in winter. Frisch tells us, that it is found also in the skirts of the woods, perched on a tree; but this seldom occurs, and still more rarely is it discovered in the heart of forests. It sometimes rests on house-tops, the walls of abbeys, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This lark, though not so common as the sky∣lark, is however spread through the most of Europe, if not in the northern parts. It is found in Italy, according to Olina; in France, according to Belon; in Germany, according to Willughby; in Poland, according to Rzacynski; and in Scotland, according to Sibbald: but I doubt whether it inhabit Sweden, since Lin∣naeus does not mention it in his <HI>Fauna Succica.</HI></P>
<P>The crested lark changes not its abode in winter; but Belon was hasty in suspecting the
<PB N="67" REF="84"/>
text of Aristotle, since it is only said that bird conceals itself in that season, and surely it is less seen in winter than in summer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. viii. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The song of the males is loud, yet so mellow and pleasant, that a sick person can bear it in his chamber <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Traité du Serin, p. 43.</NOTE>.—In order to make them sing at all times indiscriminately, they are shut, up in cages: their warble is ordinarily accompanied by a quivering of the wings. They are the first to hail the return of spring, and to chant the appearance of the morning, particularly when the air is calm and clear; and sometimes they warble during the night <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>: for fine weather exhilarates and inspires congenial notes; but clouds and rain oppress their spirits, and occa∣sion languor and gloomy silence. They gene∣rally sing till the end of September.—As these birds are with difficulty habituated to confine∣ment, and as they live only a short time in the cage, it is proper to set them at liberty each year in the end of June, which is the time when they cease to sing; and to trust to the catching of others the following spring. And though the bird be dismissed, its music may be pre∣served; for, if it be put beside a young sky-lark or a young canary, they will soon learn to imitate it <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="85"/>
But besides the excellence of his warble, the male is distinguished by the strength of his bill, the bigness of his head, and by a larger share of black on his breast <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. He conducts his amours in the same way as the sky-lark; only, by reason of the smaller numbers, he is obliged to describe a more spacious circle in the air.</P>
<P>The female constructs her nest like the com∣mon lark, but oftenest near the highways: she lays four or five eggs, and takes little concern in hatching them. It is even said that a very moderate warmth, aided by the sun's rays, is sufficient for the purpose <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As these nests are made on the ground, some ignorant credulous person may have seen a toad beside them, or even on the eggs; and hence the fable, that the crested and some other species of larks entrusted the toads with the business of incubation.</NOTE>; but after the young are excluded, they awaken her tenderness by their repeated cries, and she then provides for them with a maternal affection till they are flown.</P>
<P>Frisch says, that they breed twice a year, and prefer to nestle in junipers: but this re∣mark is chiefly adapted to the climate of Ger∣many.</P>
<P>The early education of the young succeeds easily, but they are always more difficult to be supported afterwards; and it is uncommon, as I
<PB N="69" REF="86"/>
have asserted on the authority of Frisch, to pre∣serve them alive in the cage for a whole year. And even when we give them the food that agrees best with them, which is ants' eggs, ox and sheep's hearts minced down, bruised hemp∣seed and millet, we must be careful, in intro∣ducing the little balls into the throat, not to derange the tongue, which might prove fatal.</P>
<P>Autumn is the proper season to lay snares for these birds; and then great numbers in plump condition are caught on the verge of the forests. Frisch observes, that they may be decoyed by the call, which the sky-larks are proof against. The other differences are these: The crested lark never consorts in flocks; its plumage is less varied and more white; its bill is longer, and its tail and wings shorter; it does not mount so high in the air, is less able to struggle with the winds, and returns sooner to the ground. In other properties, the two species are alike, and even with regard to the period of their lives, when not abridged by the constraints of slavery.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears that, of all the larks, the crested, notwithstanding the attach∣ment it is said to shew to man, has the most independent disposition, and recoils from the domestic state. It lives solitary, to escape per∣haps the restraints of the social condition.—
<PB N="70" REF="87"/>
However, it can forget its native warble <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The crested lark is the only one perhaps that may be instructed in the space of a month. It repeats an air whistled to it, even when sleeping with its head under its wing; but its voice is very feeble.</NOTE>, and is soon taught other airs, which it repeats without blending or confusion <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The crested lark can learn many airs perfectly, which the canary cannot.... Besides, it retains nothing of its na∣tive warble.... And this the canary can never lay aside." <HI>Traité du Serin de Canarie,</HI> p. 43, edit. 1707.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the subject observed by Willughby, the tongue was broad and rather forked, the <HI>caeca</HI> extremely short, and the gall-bladder of a dull blueish green, which that naturalist attributes to some accidental cause.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus gives the figure of an aged erested lark. Its bill was white round the base; the back cinereous; the under side of the body whitish, and also the breast whitish, though dotted with brown; the wings almost entirely white, and the tail black.</P>
<P>The crested lark has other enemies besides man: the smallest of the rapacious birds at∣tack it, and Albertus saw one devoured by a raven. It dreads its ravenous foes so much as to throw itself at the mercy of the fowler, or remain motionless in a furrow till it be caught by the hand.</P>

<P><PB N="73" REF="90"/>
It frequents heaths, commons, and even woods, whence the German name <HI>Wald-lerche:</HI> in such situations it builds its nest, and hardly ever among corn.</P>
<P>In the rigours of winter, and particularly when the ground is covered with snow, it resorts to the dunghills, and picks up its food about the barns. It also haunts the highways, and certainly for the same reason.</P>
<P>According to Longolius, it is a bird of pas∣sage, which remains in Germany all winter, and leaves that country about the time of the equinox.</P>
<P>Gesner mentions another crested lark, of which he saw only a drawing, and which had only a slight variation of plumage, there being more white round the eyes and the neck, and below the belly. But this might be owing to age, as in the instance of the former article; or it might arise from some accidental cause: the dif∣ference is undoubtedly insufficient to constitute a distinct species.

<P>THIS is a new species, which M. Guys sent to us from Provence. It appears to be related to the crested lark; for it has a small supine tuft, which it probably can elevate at pleasure. It is properly the bird of the morn∣ing, since it begins with the earliest dawn, and seems to rouse the other birds. According to Guys, the male does not leave his mate when she hatches; and when the one is employed in seeking their food, which consists of caterpillars, grashoppers, and even snails, the other keeps watch, to give the signal when danger threatens.</P>
<P>The throat and all the under side of the body are whitish, with small blackish spots on the neck and breast; the tuft feathers blackish, edged with white; the upper side of the head and body, variegated with blackish and light rufous; the great coverts of the wings tipt with white; the quills of the tail and of the wings, brown edged with light rufous, except some in

Kalm indeed informs us that the natural song is admirable; but this traveller seems not to have been long enough in America to have distinguished what were the genuine notes: with us, mimics do not often succeed but in imita∣tions. I have little doubt, however, but that this bird would be fully equal to the song of the nightingale in its whole compass; but then, from the attention which the <HI>mocker</HI> pays to any other sort of disagreeable noises, these capital notes would always be debased by a bad mixture."</P>

the whole, and joins sweetness of tone with variety and extent of execution. His notes assume each diversity of character, and receive every change of modulation; not a part is repeated without variation; and the attention is kept perpetually awake, and charmed by the endless flexibility of strains. The leader of the vernal chorus begins the prelude with a low and timid voice, and he prepares for the hymn to nature by essaying his powers and attuning his organs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"I have commonly observed," says Mr. Barrington, "that my nightingale began softly, like the ancient orators; reserving its breath to swell certain notes, which by this means had a most astonishing effect, and which eludes all verbal description."</NOTE>: by degrees the sound opens and swells; it bursts with loud and vivid flashes;
<PB N="80" REF="98"/>
it flows with smooth volubility; it faints and murmurs; it shakes with rapid and violent ar∣ticulations: the soft breathings of love and joy are poured from his inmost soul, and every heart beats unison, and melts with delicious languor. But this continual richness might sa∣tiate the ear. The strains are at times relieved by pauses <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The English bird-catchers, we are told by Mr. Bar∣rington, give these names to some of the nightingale's notes: <HI>Sweet, Sweet jug, Jug sweet, Water bubble, Pipe rattle, Bell pipe, Scroty, Skeg, Skeg, skeg, Swat swat swaty, Whitlow, whitlow, whitlow,</HI> from some distant affinity to the words.</NOTE>, which bestow dignity and eleva∣tion. The mild silence of evening heightens the general effect, and not a rival interrupts the solemn scene.</P>
<P>The nightingale excels all birds in the soft∣ness and mellowness, and also in the duration of its warble, which sometimes lasts without interruption twenty minutes. Barrington reckons sixteen distinct notes between the highest and lowest keys, and finds that its song fills a circle of a mile in diameter, which is equal to the power of the human voice. Mr. J. Hunter discovered that the muscles of the larynx are stronger in this species than in any other, and even that they were strongest in the male, which alone sings.</P>
<P>Aristotle, and after him Pliny, affirms that
<PB N="81" REF="99"/>
the song of the nightingale lasts in its full vigour for fifteen days and nights, without intermission, at the time when the trees expand their foliage. But this must be restricted to the wild nightin∣gales, and even these are not always silent before and after the period assigned; indeed, they sing then with most animation and con∣stancy. They generally begin in the month of April, and cease not until June, about the time of the solstice. Their silence is greatest when the young are excluded from the eggs, and absorb their attention in providing food. The tame nightingales sing during six months, and their warble has not only more extent, but is more perfectly formed: whence Barrington infers, that in this species, as well as in many others, the male does not chant with the view of amusing the female, or of relieving the tedium of incubation; a conclusion which is entirely just and well founded. The female hatches from instinct; she is prompted by a passion stronger than love itself; and, in that occupation, she must feel a pleasure, which, though we cannot conceive it, must be exquisite, and needs no solace. The male is the most powerfully stimulated to court the joys of love, and warble his amorous tales; and the opening flush of spring inflames his ardent desires. When the nightingale is confined, his wants are sup∣plied and anticipated, and he enjoys the vernal
<PB N="82" REF="100"/>
mildness through the greater part of the year; every thing concurs to foster his passion, and the melody of his song ceases only for a short interval. Such is also the case with those which are caught after they are grown up; within a few hours they often resume their warble, in all its richness of expression; no longer is it limited by the transient seasons. But the love of liberty is not extinguished in their bo∣som: for the first week, they can hardly support their forlorn condition; they must be pinioned and fed. However, their passion for warbling in the end surmounts every desponding recol∣lection. The song of other birds, the music of instruments, the accents of a sweet and sonorous voice, powerfully awaken their languid powers. They are eagerly attracted by sweet sounds, and seem particularly fond of <HI>duos;</HI> which shews that they are not insensible to the effects of har∣mony. But they are not silent auditors; they strike the unison, and strive to eclipse their rivals. It is said that a nightingale dropped dead at the feet of a person who sung; another fretted, swell∣ed its throat, and murmured discontent when∣ever a canary, which was beside it, began to chant, till at last, by its menaces, it silenced its competitor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note of M. de Varicourt, Advocate.</HI> M. le Moine, trea∣surer of France, at Dijon, who takes pleasure in raising nightingales, remarked also that his pursued bitterly a tame canary, that was kept in the same room, when it approached their cage. But this jealousy turns sometimes into emu∣lation; for nightingales have been observed to sing better than others, merely because they heard birds whose strains were inferior to theirs. <HI>Certant inter se, palamque animosa contentic est: victa morte finit saepe vitam.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 29. They have been imagined to sing duos, with the interval of a third.</NOTE>.—Real superiority is not always
<PB N="83" REF="101"/>
exempt from jealousy. May not this desire of excelling be the reason why they choose advan∣tageous situations, and delight to sing to the returning echo?</P>
<P>The nightingales differ much in the quality of their song; in some it is so inferior, that they are reckoned not worth keeping. It is even said, their warble is not the same in every country: the bird-fanciers in England prefer the nightingales of Surry to those of Middle∣sex; as they value most the chaffinches from Essex, and the goldfinches from Kent. This diversity of song has been properly compared to the different dialects of the same language. It may arise from accidental causes: a nightingale happens to hear the sweet music of some other birds, and, in the glow of emulation, improves his own; he communicates the melody to his young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny relates, that the parent is careful in instructing his young. Lib. x. 29. &amp; lib. iv. 9.</NOTE>; and thus it is transmitted, with va∣rious alterations, through the succeeding races.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="102"/>
After the month of June, the nightingale's warble is gone; a raucous croaking remains, and the sweet Philomela is no longer recognized. No wonder that, in ancient Italy, it then received another name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 49.</NOTE>. In regard to song, it is quite a different bird, and even the colours of its plumage are somewhat altered.</P>
<P>In the nightingales, as in other species, there are females which enjoy some prerogatives of the male, and particularly participate of his song. I saw a female of that sort which was tame; her warble resembled that of the male, yet neither so full nor so varied: she retained it until spring, when, resuming the character of the sex, she exchanged it for the occupation of building her nest and laying her eggs, though she had no mate. It would seem that in warm coun∣tries, as in Greece, such females are pretty common, both in this species, and many others at least this is implied in a passage of Aristotle <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Some males sing like their females, as appears in the genus of the nightingales; but the female gives over song when she hatches." <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. iv. 9. The enthusiasts of music imagine, that the song of the nightingale contributes more than warmth to quicken the chick in the egg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A musician, says Frisch, ought to study the song of the nightingale, and write it. This is what the jesuit Kircher formerly attempted, and which has been lately tried by Barrington.
<PB N="85" REF="103"/>
Yet the latter owns that he could not succeed; for though the notes were played by an excel∣lent performer on the flute, they bore no resem∣blance to the nightingale's warble. Mr. Bar∣rington suspects the difficulty to arise from the impossibility of marking the musical intervals. Their measures are so varied, their transitions so insensibly blended, the succession of their tones so wild and irregular as to soar beyond every constraint of method: but still more dif∣ficult it would be, to imitate with a dead instru∣ment the expression of the nightingale, his tender sighs, and his melting accents. The animated organ of voice can alone aspire to the music of nature; and the rare accomplishment of a soft, clear, flexible, sonorous tone, of a delicate and discerning ear, and of an exquisite sensibility, will sometimes succeed. I knew two persons, who, though they had not noted a single bar, imitated the whole extent of the nightingale's warble, and so accurately as to deceive the hearer: they were two men, who rather whistled than sung: the one whistled so softly, that it was im∣possible to perceive the motion of his lips; the other blew with more force, and his attitude was somewhat constrained, though his imitation was still perfect. A few years ago, there was a man at London who attracted the nightingales with his song; insomuch that they alighted on
<PB N="86" REF="104"/>
him, and allowed themselves to be caught by the hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annual Register,</HI> for 1764. <HI>Aldrovandus,</HI> p. 783. "There are persons, who, putting water into transverse reeds, and blowing into an aperture, imitate the sound per∣fectly." <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. x. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But though few can imitate the nightingale, every person is eager to enjoy its song. It is a domestic of a capricious humour, which neither cheerfulness nor affection can direct. It must be treated with tenderness, and supplied abun∣dantly with the food it likes: the walls should be painted with verdure, and shaded and enrich∣ed with foliage; moss should be strewed beneath its feet; it must be guarded against cold, and from troublesome visits <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is even recommended to clean it seldom when it sings.</NOTE>; and every illusion must be employed to dispel the gloom of captivity. Such precautions will succeed. If an old one is caught in the beginning of spring, it will sing in seven or eight days, or even sooner <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Those which are taken after the 15th of May sing seldom the rest of the season. Those which sing not in á fortnight will never sing, and are often females.</NOTE>, and will renew its warble every year, in the month of May and the end of December. If young ones of the first hatch are educated, they will begin to chant as soon as they can eat by themselves; their voice will rise and form by degrees, and attain its full perfection about the
<PB N="87" REF="105"/>
end of December. Their warble is much supe∣rior to that of the wild nightingales, and will flow each day of the year, except in the season of moulting. They will appropriate the notes of other birds, through imitation or rivalship <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, lib. iv. 9. &amp; lib. x. 29.</NOTE>, and they will even chant the stiff airs of a nightingale∣pipe. They may be instructed even to sing by turns with a chorus, and repeat their couplet at the proper time. They may be also taught to speak any language. The sons of the empe∣ror Claudius had some nightingales that spoke Greek and Latin <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pliny, lib. x. 42.</NOTE>. But what Pliny subjoins is more marvellous; that these birds prepared every day new expressions, and even of consi∣derable length, with which they entertained their masters <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">These young princes were Drusus and Britannicus.</NOTE>. The arts of flattery might work upon the understandings of young princes; but a philosopher like Pliny ought not to have credited such a story, nor have published it under the sanction of his name. Several authors accordingly, resting on the authority of the Roman naturalist, have amplified the marvellous tale. Gesner, among others, quotes a letter from a person of credit (as we shall find), who mentions two nightingales belonging to an inn∣keeper at Ratisbon which passed the night dis∣coursing
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
in German on the political interests of Europe; on the events already happened, and on those which might be expected, and which actually took place. It is true that the author of the letter endeavours to render the story more probable, by telling us that the birds only repeated what they heard of some officers, or deputies from the Diet, who frequented the tavern; but still the whole is so absurd as to merit no serious refutation.</P>
<P>I have said that the old prisoners had two seasons for singing; the months of May and December. But here art interferes, and again diverts the course of nature. The chamber is darkened, and the birds are silent. If the light be restored by degrees, it will produce the effect of spring, and the nightingales will resume their warble. If we have a sufficient number of old singers, we may, by successive manoeuvres, and by hastening or retarding the time of moulting, be entertained with continual melody. Some of the young birds which are raised, sing dur∣ing the night; but most of them begin to chant at eight or nine of the morning, in the winter solstice, and gradually earlier as the days lengthen.</P>
<P>One would hardly believe that a song so varied as that of the nightingale is confined within the narrow limits of a single octave; yet this is ascertained by an observer of infor∣mation
<PB N="89" REF="107"/>
and taste <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Remond, who has translated several pieces of the <HI>Collection Academique.</HI></NOTE>. He remarks indeed, that some tones shoot like a gleam to the second octave; but these are accidental, and occasioned by violent efforts of voice, as when a person happens to blow into a flute with excessive force, he produces sounds uncommonly shrill.</P>
<P>Though slow in acquiring it, the nightingale is susceptible of an unshaken attachment. It distinguishes the step of its master, and wel∣comes his approach with the music of joy; and even in the moulting season, it idly strains its enfeebled organs to express the warmth of its heart. Sometimes it dies of melancholy at the loss of its benefactor; and, if it survives the shock, it is tardy in forming new attachments <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. le Moine.</NOTE>.—Such is even the case with shy and timid cha∣racters; their intimacies are slow and difficult, but, once established, they are ardent and dur∣able.</P>
<P>The nightingales are also very solitary; they migrate alone, appearing in April and May, and retiring in September <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In Italy, they arrive in March and April, and retire about the beginning of November. In England, they ar∣rive in April and May, and retire in the month of August.</NOTE>. The union be∣tween the sexes in the spring seems to increase their aversion to society: they select certain
<PB N="90" REF="108"/>
tracts, and oppose the encroachments of others on their territories. But this conduct is not occasioned by rivalship, as some have supposed; it is suggested by the solicitude for the main∣tenance of their young, and regulated by the extent of ground necessary to afford sufficient food. The distances between their nests are much smaller in the rich counties, than in others which reluctantly yield a penurious supply.</P>
<P>They begin to build their nest about the end of April, or the opening of May. The mate∣rials are leaves, rushes, stalks of coarse grass, and the inside is lined with small fibres and roots, horse-hair, and a sort of bur. They are placed in a favourable aspect, turned somewhat to the east, near water, and commonly on the lowest branches of shrubs, as gooseberries, white thorns, sloes, elm-hedges, &amp;c. or in a tust of grass, and even on the ground under bushes. And hence their eggs and their young, and sometimes the mother, are often devoured by dogs, foxes, pole-cats, weasels, adders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In our climate, the female usually lays five eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle says five or six; which may be true in the warm climate of Greece.</NOTE>, of an uniform greenish brown, except that the brown predominates at the obtuse end, and the green at the acute. She hatches alone, and never leaves her station but for food, and
<PB N="91" REF="109"/>
then only in the evening, and when hard pressed with hunger: during her absence, the male seems to cast an eye on the nest. In eighteen or twenty days the young begin to burst their shells, and the number of the cock birds is generally double that of the hens. And hence, when in April a cock is caught, the hen soon finds another mate, the loss of which is supplied by a third, and so on; insomuch that the successive seizure of three or four males has little effect on the multiplication of the brood. The hen disgorges the food for the young, as in the canaries; and the cock assists. He now ceases to warble, and is totally absorbed in the concerns of his family: and even during incu∣bation, it is said, he seldom sings near the nest, lest he discover it; but if a person approach it, his paternal solicitude drowns the suggestions of prudence, and his shrieks only increase the danger.—In less than a fortnight the young are fledged, and at this time we ought to remove those intended to be trained. After they are flown, the parents make a second hatch, and then a third; but the last fails, if the cold sets in early. In hot countries, they breed even four times annually; but the late hatches are always more scanty.</P>
<P>Man, who is never satisfied till he can use and abuse what he possesses, has contrived to make the nightingales breed in their prison.
<PB N="92" REF="110"/>
The great obstacle to his plans was their ar∣dent love of liberty; but he has diverted this original bent by fostering more violent passions, the impulse for propagation, and the attach∣ment to offspring. A pair of nightingales are let loose into a large volary, or rather in a corner of a garden planted with ivy, horn∣beams, and other shrubs, and inclosed with nets. This is the easiest and surest method; but there is another which also may be em∣ployed. The cock and hen are put into sepa∣rate cages in a darkish closet, and are fed every day at the same hours; the cages are some∣times left open, that they may become ac∣quainted with their apartment, and in April they are entirely opened, and not shut again; at which time the birds are supplied with the materials usual for constructing their nests, such as oak-leaves, moss, plucked dog-grass, deer's wool, horse-hairs, earth and water; but the water must be removed when the female hatches <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Traité du Rossignol, p. 96.</NOTE>. A contrivance has also been used to settle nightingales in places which they never visited: the brood are caught with the parent birds, and conveyed to a spot which resembles most their former haunt: the cock and hen are placed in two cages near the nest of young, and
<PB N="93" REF="111"/>
the cages are artfully opened while the person remains concealed: the parents run to the cries of their nestlings, and foster and continue to educate them: and it is said they will return to the same part the succeeding year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Traité du Rossignol, p. 96.</NOTE>; but it must afford them conveniences and proper food <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"When a place affords abundance of food and con∣venience for nestling, one had better catch or destroy the nightingales, since others will always return." <HI>Frisch.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>If a person would raise young nightingales, he should prefer those of the first hatch, and give them what instructors he thinks proper; but the best, in my opinion, are other night∣ingales, especially the best singers.</P>
<P>In the month of August, both the old and young nightingales emerge from the woods, and haunt the bushes, the quick-set hedges, and the new ploughed fields, where they find greater plenty of worms and insects: perhaps this ge∣neral movement is only preparatory to their ap∣proaching slight. They winter not in France, nor in England, Germany, Italy, Greece, &amp;c. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The nightingale disappears in autumn, and appears not again till spring, says Aristotle. <HI>Hist.

The cobang is equal to forty taels, and the tael worth about half a crown; so that the twenty cobangs amount to an hundred pounds sterling.

I know that the fact has been doubted with regard to Ireland, Scotland, and Holland; but these assertions must not be strictly interpreted.

<P>This bird is peculiar to the old continent; and though the missionaries and voyagers speak of the nightingales of Canada, that of Louisiana, that of the Antilles, &amp;c. the latter is only a kind of mocking-bird; and that of Louisiana is the same, since, according to Dupratz, it is found in Martinico and Guadaloupe; and it is ma∣nifest, from Father Charlevoix's account, that the one of Canada is either not a nightingale at all, or is of a very degenerate sort <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The Canada nightingale," says this missionary, "is nearly the same with respect to figure, but has not half the song." <HI>Nouvelle France,</HI> t. iii. p. 157.</NOTE>. It is indeed possible that the nightingale, which
<PB N="96" REF="114"/>
visits the northern parts of Europe and Asia, may have traversed the narrow seas, which, at those high latitudes, divide the two continents; or it might have been swept across by a violent wind, or carried by some ship: and as the cold, raw, unfertile state <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that there are many insects in America; but most of them are so large and so well armed, that the night∣ingale, far from preying upon them, would scarcely be able to defend himself against their attacks.</NOTE> of the country has been found to be unfavourable to the song of birds, it would lose the sweetness of its melody, as the nightingale's warble in Scotland <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, who cites Petrus Apponensis.

This seems to have been really the case; and our nightingale has been transplanted into Canada; for the imperfect account of Charlevoix has since been confirmed by a physician <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This physician wrote to M. Salerne, that our nightin∣gale is found in Canada, as well as here, in the season. It occurs also in Gaspesia, according to Father Le Clerc, but does not sing so well.</NOTE> residing at Quebec, and by some travellers.</P>
<P>As these birds, at least the males, pass the nights of spring in singing, the ancients be∣lieved that during that season they never slept <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hesiod and Aelian.</NOTE>;
<PB N="97" REF="115"/>
and hence they inferred that the flesh had a soporific quality, and imagined that its heart and eyes laid under a person's head would keep him awake. This notion spread; and being transferred into the arts, the nightingale be∣came the emblem of vigilance. But the moderns, who have observed with greater accuracy, find that in the season of love the nightingales sleep during the day, and that in winter their diurnal slumbers precede the resuming of their warble. They even dream, and their visions have the complexion of their character <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Traité du Rossignol.</NOTE>; for they hum their airs with a low voice.—Many fables have been propagated with regard to the nightingale, as usual with whatever is celebrated. In the midst of its warble, it is attracted by the fixed looks of a viper, or, according to others, of a toad, and is gradually deprived of its voice; and at last, yielding to the fascination, it sinks into the open mouth of the reptile. It has been said that the parents select from their young those which discover talents, and either destroy the rest, or allow them to perish of want. (We must suppose that they save the females.) It has been alleged that they chant better when persons listen to them than when alone. All these errors originate from our proneness to ascribe to animals our own weaknesses, passions, and vices.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="116"/>
Nightingales that are kept in the cage com∣monly bathe after singing. Hebert remarks, that this is the first thing they do in the even∣ing, when the candles are lighted. He also tells a circumstance which it may be proper to guard against, that they are apt to dart towards the flame; and that an excellent cock bird, happen∣ing to escape from the cage, flew into the fire, and was burnt to death.</P>
<P>These birds have a sort of vibrating motion, and by turns raise and depress their body. All the males which I have seen had this singular property; but I could not perceive it in a fe∣male which I kept two years. In all of them, the tail oscillates distinctly upwards and down∣wards; which has manifestly induced Linnaeus to range them with the <HI>motacillae,</HI> or wagtails.</P>
<P>Nightingales hide themselves in the thick∣est bushes: they live upon aquatic and other insects, small worms, the eggs, or rather nymphs, of ants; they also eat figs, ber∣ries, &amp;c. But as it would be difficult always to provide such food, several kinds of paste have been contrived, which agree very well with them. I shall, in the notes, give the receipt of a bird-fancier of my acquaintance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Le Moine, whom I have already quoted on several occasions, gives different pastes, according to the age of the bird. The first is composed of sheep's heart, crumbs of bread, hemp-seed, and parsley well pounded, and mixed: it must be new-made every day. The second consists of equal parts hashed omelet and bread-crumbs, with a little chopped parsley. The third is more compound, and requires more care. Take two pounds of lean beef, half a pound of chicken-pease, as much of yellow or peeled millet, of the seed of white poppy, and of sweet almonds, a pound of white honey, two ounces of flour, twelve yolks of fresh eggs, two or three ounces of fresh butter, and a gros and a half of saffron in powder; dry the whole well; heat it a long time, stirring it constantly, and reduce it to a very fine dust, and pass it through a silk sieve. This powder keeps very well, and serves about a year.</NOTE>, because
<PB N="99" REF="117"/>
it has been found to answer, and I have seen a nightingale which with this subsistence reached the age of seventeen years. It began to turn gray the seventh year; at fifteen, its wing and tail quills were entirely white; its legs, or rather <HI>tarsus,</HI> had much swelled, by the excessive growth of the scales which cover these parts; and it had a sort of knots at the toes, like persons who are gouty; and it was necessary, from time to time, to whet the point of its upper man∣dible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The nails also of nightingales that are kept in the cage grow much at first, so as to become troublesome from their excessive length.

But still it had none of the ills of old age; it was ever joyous, and warbled as in its earlier years, and caressed the hand that fed

it. We may remark, that this nightingale had never paired. Love seems to abridge the period of life; but it fills up the void of time, and accomplishes the intention of nature. Without it the delightful emotions of the parent would never be known: it prolongs the existence into futurity, and confers immortality on the species. So rich the compensation it makes for the loss of a few days of injoyous and decrepit old age!</P>
<P>It has been found, that heating medicines and perfumes incited the nightingales to warble; that flour mites and dung maggots were the most proper to give when they were too fat, and figs when too lean; and that spiders served them as a purge.

If they be let loose in a place where there are other birds in cages, they fly directly towards these; and this is one method among many others of catching them. The song of their companions, the sound of musical instruments, or of a fine voice, as we have already seen, and even cries that are disagreeable, as the mewing of a cat fastened to the root of a tree and teased on purpose, succeed equally well. They have a stupid staring curiosity, and are the dupes of every thing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Avis miratrix,</HI> says Linnaeus.</NOTE>. They are caught by the call, by lime-twigs in tit-mice traps, and nooses set where the ground is newly plough∣ed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sometimes they are very numerous in a single district. Belon witnessed that, in a village of the forest of Ardenne, the shepherd boys caught every day each a score, with many other small birds. It was a year of drought, and all the "pools," says Belon, "were elsewhere dried up ... for they live then in the forests, where there is some moisture."</NOTE>, where are previously scattered the nymphs of ants, mites, or whatever resembles these, as small bits of the whites of hard eggs, &amp;c.

On the contrary, to hasten their moulting, a few feathers should be plucked from the tail, that the new ones may sprout
<PB N="102" REF="120"/>
the sooner; for while nature is employed in the reproduction of the plumage, she suspends the song.</P>
<P>These birds are delicious food when fat, and in this respect they rival the ortolans. In Gas∣cony, they are fatted for the table. This re∣minds us of the whim of the Emperor He∣liogabalus, who ate the tongues of nightin∣gales, of peacocks, &amp;c. and the famous dish of the comedian Aesop, which consisted of an hundred birds, all noted for their song or their prattle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, lib. x. 51. This dish was valued at six hundred <HI>sesterces</HI> (near <HI>five thousands pounds!).</HI> Aldrovandus also ate nightingales, and found them good.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it is a matter of some consequence not to lose time in breeding females, many marks have been given to distinguish the cocks. Their eye, it is said, is larger, their head rounder, their bill longer, and broader at the base, espe∣cially if viewed from below; the higher plumage more coloured, the belly not so white, the tail more feathered, and broader when displayed: they begin sooner to chirp, and their chirp is better supported: their anus is more promi∣nent in the love season, and they remain long in one place, resting on one foot, while the hen runs backwards and forwards in the cage. Others add, that the male has two or three quills
<PB N="103" REF="121"/>
in each wing whose outer surface is black, and their legs, if viewed in a side light, appear reddish, while those of the female look whitish: however, the hen has the same motion of the tail; and, when cheerful, she does not walk, but hops like the cock. To these we may join the more decisive differences of internal structure. The males which I dissected in the spring had two very large testicles of an egg shape; the largest of the two (for they were not equal) was three lines and a half in length, and two in breadth: the <HI>ovaria</HI> of the females which I observed at the same time contained eggs of different sizes, from a quarter of a line to one line in diameter.</P>
<P>The plumage of this bird is much inferior to its warble. All the upper side of the body is brown, more or less rusty; the throat, breast and belly are of a white gray; the fore part of the neck, of a deeper gray; the inferior coverts of the tail and wings, rusty white and of a ferrugi∣nous cast in the males; the quills of the wings, of a brownish gray verging on rufous, and the tail of a brown tinged more with rufous: the bill is brown, and also the feet, but with a shade of flesh colour: the ground colour of the feathers is deep cinereous.</P>
<P>It has been alleged, that the nightingales bred in the southern climates have a darker
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
plumage, and those raised in the northern coun∣tries a whiter. The young cocks are also said to be whiter than young hens; and in general the colour of the young ones is the most variable before moulting, that is, before the end of July; and it is then so like that of the redstart, that it would be difficult to distinguish them unless by the difference of their chirping <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The young cock nightingale calls <HI>ziscra, ziscra,</HI> accord∣ing to Olina; <HI>croi, croi,</HI> according to others.

It is cer∣tain that of nightingales there are varieties; but naturalists are much divided in regard to the haunts of the large kind of these birds, whether they frequent the plains, or the margin of waters. Schwenckfeld asserts that the small ones settle on the pleasant knolls: Aldrovandus says, that they live in the woods: others, on the con∣trary,
<PB N="106" REF="124"/>
maintain with more probability, that such as inhabit the dry forests which exclude the rain and the dew, are the smallest sort. In Anjou, there is a kind of nightingales which are much larger than ordinary, and which lodge and nestle among the hornbeams; and the little ones prefer the sides of rivulets and pools. Frisch speaks also of a breed somewhat larger than the common sort, and which sing more in the night, and in a manner rather different. Lastly, the author of the treatise on the night∣ingale admits three kinds; the largest, strong∣est, and best singers lodge among the bushes near water; the middle-sized live in the plains; and the smallest dwell in the mountains. From all this it appears that there is one or more breeds of large nightingales, but they are attached to a very permanent abode. The large nightingale is the most common in Silesia; its plumage is cinereous with a mixture of rufous, and it is reckoned a better singer than the small kind.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE WHITE NIGHTINGALE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luscinia Candida, <HI>Briss.</HI></NOTE>. This variety was very rare at Rome. Pliny relates, that a present was made of one to Agrippina, wife of the Emperor Claudius, which cost 6000 sesterces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Hist.

<PB N="107" REF="125"/>
in his time, and which must be equal to double that sum at present. Aldrovandus however as∣serts, that there is some mistake in the figures, and that the amount is still greater. That author saw a white nightingale, but mentions no particulars with regard to it. The Marquis d'Argence has one of this colour at present, which though young is very large, and its warble formed, but not so powerful as that of the old ones. "Its head and neck," says the Marquis, "are of the finest white; its wings and tail of the same colour: the feathers on the mid∣dle of the back are of a very light brown, and intermixed with small white feathers... those under the belly are of a white gray. This stranger seemed to cause wonderful jea∣lousy in an old nightingale which I have had for some time."</P>

<P>IN the dreary season of winter, nature sinks into inactivity and torpor. The insects no more appear; the reptiles cease to crawl; the vegetables are stripped of their verdure, and arrested in their growth; the inhabitants of the air have perished, or retired to happier climes; those of the waters are confined to their icy prisons, and most of the land animals have repaired to their caves and subterraneous man∣sions; the whole is a boundless picture of deso∣lation, and languor, and death. The vernal appearance of the feathered visiters of the grove proclaims the return of animation and of joy. Nature awakens from her lethargy, and resumes her enlivening powers. The trees spread their leafy shade; the vegetable tribes glow with their richest tints; the scene smiles around, it
<PB REF="129"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
warbles on every spray, and a genial flush heightens the whole.</P>
<P>Of the joyous guests of the woods, the fau∣vettes are the most numerous and the most charming: lively and volatile, each motion is expressive, each accent is cheerful, and each gesture displays the tenderness of love. These pretty warblers arrive when the trees put forth their leaves, and begin to expand their blossoms; they disperse through the whole extent of our plains: some inhabit our gardens, others pre∣fer the clumps and avenues; some conceal them∣selves among the reeds, and many retire to the heart of large woods. Thus the fauvettes are dispersed through every spot, and their sprightly movements, and their cheerful airs, enchant each scene <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In summer, a person cannot walk into any shady spot beside brooks, but he will hear the fauvettes warbling even at the distance of a quarter of a league: this bird is known therefore in all countries." <HI>Belou.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Possessed of every grace and elegance, beauty alone was wanted to perfection. But nature has here checked her profusion, and withheld decoration. Their plumage is dull and obscure, except in two or three species, which are slightly spotted: all the rest are stained with dark shades of whitish, gray, and rusty.</P>
<P>The first species, which is the pettychaps,
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
is of the size of the nightingale. The robe of the nightingale is brown rufous, that of the pettychaps is brown-gray: it is also lightly tinged with rusty gray, on the fringe of the coverts of the wings, and along the webs of the small quills: the large quills are of a blackish cinereous; and so are also the quills of the tail, of which the two outermost are white on their exterior side, and at the tips on both sides: over the eye there extends, from the bill, a white line like an eyebrow; and under the eye, and a little behind, there is a blackish spot; and this spot borders with the white on the throat, which has a rusty cast on the sides, of a deeper colour under the belly.</P>
<P>This is the largest of all the fauvettes, except the Alpine warbler, of which we shall treat in the sequel. Its total length is six inches; its alar extent, eight inches ten lines; its bill, from the tip to the angles, eight lines and a half; its tail, two inches six lines; its foot, ten lines.</P>
<P>It lives with other smaller species in gar∣dens, in thickets, and in fields of pease and beans: they all sit on the stakes which prop these; and there they frolic, build their nest, and continually go out and in, till harvest, which precedes their departure, forces them from this asylum, or rather this abode of love.</P>
<P>It is amusing to see them play together, grow angry, and chase each other: their attacks are
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
gentle, and their quarrels commonly end in songs. The pettychaps was regarded as the emblem of volatile amours, as the turtle was the image of ardent and steady love; yet the petty∣chaps, though lively and joyous, maintains a faithful and strong attachment, while the turtle, all sad and plaintive, infringes shamefully on the connubial rights. The male of the petty∣chaps lavishes a thousand little offices on his mate during incubation; he shares with her the solicitude for their tender young, and does not abandon her after the education of their family: his attachment outlives the appetite of fruition.</P>
<P>The nest is composed of dry herbs and stalks of hemp, and lined with a little hair. It con∣tains commonly five eggs, which the mother deserts if they are touched: this approach of an enemy she regards as a bad omen for the ex∣pected family. Nor is it possible to deceive her with the eggs of other birds. "I have often set strange eggs under several small birds," says Viscount Querhoënt; "those of the titmice un∣der wrens, those of the linnet under the red-breast: but I could never make the fauvettes hatch them; they always broke them; and, when I substituted other young ones, they soon killed them." From what wonderful instinct, if we believe the bulk of bird-catchers, and even of observers, do the pettychaps hatch the egg which the cuckoo drops into their nest after
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
destroying their own; and how can they foste the little ugly usurper as their own progeny However, it is the babbling fauvette or warble to which this trust is the oftenest committed and perhaps that species has different instincts—The pettychaps is of a timid character; flies from birds as small as itself, and with bet∣ter reason it makes a rapid retreat from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shrike, its formidable enemy: but the danger is forgotten the moment it is past, and the little warbler again resumes its cheerfulness, and frisks, and sings. It is heard in the thicke boughs, where it is generally concealed; a times it pops out to the edge of a bush, but hides itself again in an instant, particularly i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the heat of the day. In the morning it gather the dew; and, after the fall of a summer's showe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it trips among the wet leaves, and brushes off the drops.</P>
<P>Almost all the fauvettes retire at the same time, in the middle of autumn, and scarcel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any remain in October. Their departure pre¦cedes the cold weather, which destroys the in¦sects, and blasts the small fruits, on which the subsist; for they not only catch flies, and gnat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and search for worms, but they eat the berries <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ivy, mezereon, and brambles: they grow f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> during the maturity of the elders, dwarf elde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and privets.</P>

the tongue is fringed at the tip, and appears forked: the inside of the bill is yellow at the bottom, and black towards the extremity: the gizzard is muscular, and preceded by a dilatation of the <HI>oesophagus:</HI> the intestines are seven inches and a half long: there is generally no gall blad∣der, but two small <HI>coeca:</HI> the outer toe is con∣nected to the middle one by the first <HI>phalanx,</HI> and the outer nail is the strongest of all. The testicles in a male caught the 18th of June were five inches lengthwise, and the smaller diameter four inches. A female was dissected on the fourth of the same month, and the oviduct was much dilated, and contained an egg, and the <HI>ovarium</HI> presented a cluster of unequal sizes.</P>
<P>In the southern provinces of France, and in Italy, most of the fauvettes are called epicurean warblers <HI>(bec-figues);</HI> an error to which the nomenclators with their generic term <HI>ficedula</HI> have not a little contributed. Aldrovandus gives a confused and incomplete account of the species comprehended; and he seems not sufficiently acquainted with them. Frisch remarks, that the genus of the fauvettes is the most obscure and indetermined in the whole of ornithology. We have endeavoured to throw on it some light, by following the order of nature. All our descriptions, except that of a single species, have been drawn from life; and it is from our own observations, and from the facts communi∣cated
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
by intelligent observers, that we have de∣lineated the distinctions and the similitudes and the habits which obtain among these little birds. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Nothing can exceed the confusion which nomencla∣tors have introduced into the article of the pettychaps, or fauvette. Gmelin and Latham have transferred the Greek name, <HI>hippolais,</HI> which Linnaeus had injudiciously applied to that bird, and have bestowed it on another bird about one third of the size; and at the same time they have given the pettychaps, or fauvette, the epithet <HI>hortensis.</HI> Yet while these two authors agree in the application of the terms, the one asserts that the <HI>motacilla hortensis</HI> is larger than the redpole or black-cap, but the other represents it as smaller than even the linnet. It will be unnecessary therefore to transsate the specific characters.

<P>WE adopt the name <HI>passerinette,</HI> which this bird receives in Provence. This is a small fauvette, and is distinguished from the preceding, not only by its size, but by its plumage, and by the monotonous burthen <HI>tip, tip,</HI> of its short song, which it continually re∣peats as it hops among the bushes. A very delicate white gray covers all the fore and under part of the body, receiving a very light brown cast on the sides: an uniform ash gray is spread over the whole of the upper part, and stained somewhat with blackish on the great quills of the wings and of the tail: there is a small whitish streak which passes over the eye.

<P>ARISTOTLE, enumerating the various changes which the revolution of the sea∣sons produces on the feathered tribes, says that the beccafico or epicurean warbler is metamor∣phosed in autumn into the black-cap <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 49.</NOTE>. Na∣turalists have been much puzzled with this assertion; some regard it as marvellous, others reject it as incredible <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Niphus,</HI> in Aldrovandus, strains at a solution of the problem, by distinguishing a great and little <HI>black-head;</HI> the latter not being transmuted into a beccasico, but the other being never seen at the same time, and actually undergoing the metamorphosis. "The Bolognese bird-catchers," says Aldrovandus, "thus distinguish them;" yethe will not admit that opinion, and the moment after he confounds the black-cap with the bulfinch.</NOTE>: but it is really neither
<PB N="120" REF="140"/>
the one nor the other; and the explication is very easy. In fact, the young black-caps have, through the whole summer, the plumage of the epicurean warblers, and only assume their pro∣per garb after the first moulting: and this is the interpretation which Pliny gives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. x. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus, Johnston, and Frisch, after de∣scribing the black-cap, introduce a second spe∣cies, which has a brown head <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Atricapilla altera, <HI>Johnst.</HI></P>
<P>Atricapilla alia castaneo vertice, <HI>Aldrov.</HI></P>
<P>Curruca vertice subrubro, <HI>Frisch.</HI></P></NOTE>: but this is only the female of the former, and the sole dif∣ference of appearance between the two sexes consists in the colour of the head. In the male, a black cap covers the back of the head and the crown, as far as the eyes; below and round the neck the plumage is of a slate gray, lighter on the throat, attenuated into white on the breast, and shaded with blackish on the sides: the back is of a brown gray, lighter on the ex∣terior surface of the quills, deeper on the lower ones, and stained with an olive tint. The bird is five inches five lines in length; the alar extent eight inches and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="141"/>
The black-cap has the most pleasant and the fullest warble of all the fauvettes. It is some∣what like the nightingale's song, and we enjoy it much longer; for several months after the groves no more echo Philomel's notes, the music of the black-cap is heard. Its airs are easy and light, and consist of a succession of modu∣lations of small compass, but sweet, flexible, and blended: they express the happiness and tran∣quillity that dwell in their haunts. The sensible heart warms with delicious emotions at accents inspired by nature, and flowing from that feli∣city which she has bestowed.</P>
<P>The male shews a tender concern for his fe∣male: not only does he carry flies, worms, and ants to her; but he relieves the languor of in∣cubation, and sits by turns. The nest is placed near the ground, and carefully concealed in a coppice: it contains four or five eggs, of a green∣ish hue, with spots of light brown. The young ones grow in a few days; and though but slightly fledged, they will leap out of the nest when a person comes near it, and never will return. The black-cap has generally only one annual hatch in France. Olina says that it makes two in Italy; and such must be the case with many other kinds of birds which inhabit a warmer climate, where the season of love is pro∣longed.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="142"/>
At its arrival in the spring, if the insects are destroyed by the relapse of cold, the black-cap has recourse for subsistence to the berries of some shrubs, as those of the spurge laurel and ivy; in autumn they also eat the small seeds of the berry∣bearing alder, and of the hunters service-tree <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. During that season they often go to drink, and about the end of August they are caught near the springs: they are then exceeding fat, and of a delicate taste.</P>
<P>The black-cap may be also raised in the cage; and of all the birds of the volary it is, says Olina, the most lovely <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Beyond the other birds of the cage, it is of a cheer∣ful disposition, with a sweet and delightful song, with a lovely and pleasing aspect." <HI>Olina, Uccelleria,</HI> p. 9.</NOTE>. The attachment which it shews to its master is charming; it welcomes him with a peculiar accent, and a more tender air. On his approach it darts towards him against the wires of the cage, and struggles to burst its prison to meet him; and by the continual flapping of its wings, with its feeble cries, it seems to express its transports of joy <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Olina, p. 9.

<P>This bird is common in Italy, France, Ger∣many, and even in Sweden; yet it is said to be unfrequent in England <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus speaks of a variety of this species which he calls the <HI>variegated beccafico,</HI> or fig-pecker <HI>(ficedula);</HI> but he does not inform us whether it is only an individual or a permanent difference. Brisson, who mentions it under the appellation of <HI>black and white fauvette,</HI> gives no further notice; and it would seem that the <HI>black-backed sauvette</HI> of Frisch is only the same variety.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="144"/>
The <HI>little pigeoner (petite colombaude)</HI> of the Provençals is another variety of the black-cap; only it is rather larger, and all the upper part of its body is of a deeper colour, almost blackish: its throat is white, and its sides gray: it is neat and sprightly; is fond of shades, and of the closest woods, and delights in the dew, which it eagerly collects.</P>
<P>In a hen black-cap opened the fourth of June, the <HI>ovarium</HI> contained eggs of various sizes; the intestinal tube from the <HI>anus</HI> to the gizzard was seven inches and a quarter long; there were two distinctly formed <HI>caeca,</HI> two lines in length: the tongue was slender, and forked at the end; the upper mandible slightly scalloped; the outer toe joined to the middle one by its first <HI>phalanx;</HI> the hind nail the longest of all.</P>
<P>In a cock which was dissected on the 19th of June, the testicles were four lines long, and three broad: the <HI>trachea arteria</HI> had a knot swelled where it forks; the <HI>oesophagus</HI> about two inches long, and formed a sac before its insertion into the gizzard. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Black-cap, <HI>Motacilla-Atri∣capilla:</HI> "It is brick-coloured, below cinereous, with a dark cap."

<P>ALDROVANDUS speaks of this bird under the name of <HI>Stoparola,</HI> which was given by the fowlers of Bologna, probably, says this naturalist, because it frequents the bushes and thickets where it builds its nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the Italian <HI>Stoppia,</HI> stubble or brushwood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have seen one of these nests in a black thorn three feet from the ground; it was of a
<PB N="126" REF="146"/>
cup shape, and consisted of meadow moss in∣terwoven with a few stalks of dry herbs.—Sometimes it is formed entirely with these stalks, which are finer in the inside, and coarser on the outside. The nest contained five eggs of a greenish gray, sprinkled with rusty and brown spots, which are more frequent at the obtuse end.</P>
<P>The mother was caught with her young: the iris was of a chesnut colour; the edges of the upper mandible lightly scalloped at the point; the two eyelids furnished with white lashes: the tongue was frittered at the end; the intestinal tube from the gizzard to the <HI>anus</HI> was six inches long: there were two <HI>caeca</HI> two lines in length, their distance two inches, and the first before its insertion made a dilatation: the <HI>ova∣rium</HI> contained different sized eggs.</P>
<P>In a male which was opened in the middle of May, the bowels presented very nearly the same appearances: there were two testicles, of which the right one was larger than the left, its great diameter four lines, and its small diameter two lines and three quarters: the gizzard was muscular, and the two membranes were de∣tached; it contained some fragments of insects, but no pebbles: the iris was light crimson; in another it appeared orange; which shews that this part is liable to vary in its colours, and cannot furnish a specific character.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="147"/>
Aldrovandus remarks, that the eye of the passerine is small, but brisk and lively. The back and crown of the head are ash gray: the tem∣ples, the plumage above and behind the eye, are marked with a more blackish spot: the throat is white as far as the eye: the breast and stomach are whitish, and shaded with a light rusty or vinous tint. The bird is larger than the epicurean warbler: its total length is five inches seven lines; its alar extent eight inches. In Provence it enjoys another climate, and its habits are rather different. It likes to repose under the fig-tree and the olive, feeds on their fruits, and its flesh becomes extremely delicate. Its feeble notes seem to repeat the two last sylla∣bles of its name, <HI>passerine.</HI></P>

<P>WE hear this warbler the oftenest, and al∣most continually in spring.

little a bird. Its motions are as sprightly and frequent as its babble is constant; and it is the most frisky and alert of all the fauvettes. It is perpetually bustling, fluttering, hopping in and out among the bushes, without allowing a moment's rest. It nestles in the hedges, along the high roads, in the spots which afford it shelter, and commonly near the ground, and on the tufts of grass which spring up among the roots of the bushes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>: its eggs are greenish dotted with brown.</P>
<P>According to Belon, the modern Greeks call this fauvette <HI>potamida, i. e.</HI> bird of rivers or rivu∣lets.

<PB N="130" REF="150"/>
and the reptiles which it feeds on are the cater∣pillars it finds on the shrubs and bushes.</P>
<P>Belon at first calls it the <HI>brown sauvette,</HI> and afterwards he bestows the epithet of <HI>leaden,</HI> which marks much better the real tint of its plumage. The crown of its head is cinereous; all its robe ash brown; the fore part of its body white stained with rusty; the wing quills brown, their inner edge whitish: the outer edge of the great quills is cinereous, and that of the middle ones rusty gray: the twelve quills of the tail are brown edged with gray, except the two outer∣most, which are white on the outside, as in the common fauvette or pettychaps: the bill and feet are leaden gray: it is five inches long, and its alar extent six inches: it is of the same size with the grisette or passerine warbler, and on the whole resembles it much.</P>
<P>To this species we must refer not only the <HI>hemp-beccafico</HI> of Olina, which he says is fre∣quent among the hemp-fields of Lombardy, but also the <HI>canevarola</HI> of Aldrovandus, and the <HI>titling</HI> of Turner.—This bird is easily tamed: as it lives in our meadows, our thickets, and our gardens, it is already half domesticated. If it is to be bred for the cage, which is sometimes done for the sake of its cheerful song, we must, says Olina, wait till it be fledged, and then take it from the nest, and put a bathing-cup in the

<P>IF Belon had not expressly distinguished the <HI>russet</HI> or <HI>fauvette of the woods</HI> from his <HI>mouchet,</HI> which we shall find to be the <HI>winter fauvette</HI> or hedge sparrow, we should have considered these as constituting the same species.

<PB N="132" REF="152"/>
birds, since their resemblance is so great, and their discrimination so little: we only yield to the authority of Belon, who has perhaps ob∣served them better than we have done.</P>
<P>Like the rest of the fauvettes, this bird is perpetually joyous, lively, and active, and often utters a feeble cry: it has also a song, which though monotonous is not disagreeable; and it improves the notes when it has opportunities of hearing more varied and more brilliant modu∣lations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Those which I raised seemed to have a more melo∣dious song than the wild ones, because they pretty often heard a siddle.

<P>The young ones are easily raised and bred, and they amply repay the trouble of edu∣cation by their familiarity, their pretty warble, and their cheerfulness. Nor are they destitute of courage. "Those which I trained," says De Querhoënt, "were the terror of many birds as large as themselves. In the month of
<PB N="133" REF="153"/>
April I set all my little prisoners at liberty; but the russets were the last to profit by it. As they often made short excursions, the wild birds of the same species pursued them: but they shel∣tered themselves on the sole of my window, where they stoutly defended their post: they bristled their feathers; each party trilled a fee∣ble strain, and pecked the board like cocks, and so entered into a keen combat."</P>
<P>This is the only fauvette which we have not been able to delineate from nature.—The de∣scription which is given of its plumage con∣firms us in the opinion, that this species is at least much related to the hedge sparrow, if not ex∣actly the same. Its head, the upper surface of its neck, the breast, the back, and the rump, are variegated with brown and rufous, each feather being brown in the middle, and edged with rufous; the scapular feathers, the coverts of the upper part of the wings and of the tail, va∣riegated with the same colours, and in the same manner; the throat, the lower part of the neck, the belly, and the sides, rusty; the quill feathers of the wings brown, and edged with rufous; those of the tail entirely brown. It is of the size of the pettychaps. The plumage of the fauvettes is in general dull and obscure; that of the russet is one of the most variegated, and

<P>THE reed fauvette chants in the warm nights of spring like the nightingale, which has occasioned some to call it the willow or
<PB N="135" REF="155"/>
osier nightingale. It makes its nest among reeds and bushes, amidst marshes, and in copses beside the margin of pools. We saw one in the low branches of a hornbeam, near the ground; it consisted of straw and stalks of dry herbs, with a little hair within. It is constructed with more art than that of the other fauvettes, and usually contains five eggs of a dirty white, mottled with brown, which is deeper and more spread about the thick end.</P>
<P>The young ones, though tender and not fledged, desert the nest if it be touched, or even if a person go too near it: this feature, which is common to all the fauvettes, and even to this species which breeds amidst water, seems to cha∣racterize the instinctive disposition of these birds.</P>
<P>During the whole of the summer we see it darting from among the reeds, to catch the dragon-flies, and other insects which buz on the surface of the water. It continually war∣bles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebert,</NOTE>; and it drives away the other birds <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>, that it may remain sole proprietor of its spot, which it does not quit till September, the season when it departs with its family.</P>
<P>It is of the size of the black-cap; being five inches and four lines in length, and its alar ex∣tent
<PB N="136" REF="156"/>
eight inches eight lines: its bill is seven inches and a half long; its feet, nine lines; its tail, two inches: the wings, when closed, reach beyond the middle of the tail: all the upper part of its body is of a light rusty gray, and in∣clining somewhat to olive near the rump: the feathers of the wings are browner than those of the tail: the inferior coverts of the wings are of a light yellow; the throat and all the fore part of the body yellowish on a whitish ground, and stained on the sides and near the tail with brown shades.</P>
<P>It is not in the least degree probable that the <HI>petronella</HI> of Schwenckfeld, "a bird which nestles under rocks and on the bare ground, which is seen only in the craggy parts of the mountains, and which continually jerks its tail like the wag∣tail," is the same with our reed fauvette. We cannot conceive why Brisson ranged them to∣gether; for even the plumage which Schwenck∣feld describes, would shew it to be rather a kind of redstart.</P>
<P>If the <HI>sedge bird</HI> of Albin is also the same, his figure must be a very bad one, and all its colours false: it is not painting but masking nature. The figure given by Aldrovandus, and borrowed from Gesner, under the name of <HI>sa∣licaria,</HI> has a much thicker bill than belongs to the genus of fauvettes; and if the bird <HI>(avis</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="157"/>
<HI>consimilis stoparolae &amp; magnanimae)</HI> is the reed warbler, as Brisson says, and which seems pro∣bable, it will be difficult to suppose that the <HI>salicaria</HI> is the same. Such is the confusion of Aldrovandus's account of this genus, which he seems not to have known from his own obser∣vations; and the example of this respectable naturalist shews how dangerous it is to trust to defective or inaccurate relations. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Sedge Warbler, <HI>Motacilla Salicaria:</HI> "It is cinereous, below white; its eye-brows white."

<P>BELON tells us, that he was at great pains to discover the ancient name of the little rufous fauvette, and yet in settling this point
<PB N="138" REF="158"/>
he falls into a mistake, conceiving it to be the <HI>troglodyte.</HI> He seems even sensible, in some measure, of his error; for he observes that the text of <HI>Aetius</HI> and <HI>Paul Aeginetus,</HI> which de∣scribes the <HI>troglodyte,</HI> agrees better with the brown wren than with the rufous fauvette. And we shall afterwards find that this remark is well founded. Indeed the appellation of <HI>troglodyte</HI> can refer only to a bird which frequents caverns, and the holes of rocks or of walls, a character which belongs to none of the fauvettes; though Belon, erroneously imagining the word <HI>fauvette</HI> derived from the Latin <HI>sovea,</HI> a pit or burrow, admits it to have this instinct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauvette</HI> is really derived from <HI>fauve,</HI> fox-colour. <HI>Menage.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rufous warbler has commonly five young; but they often become the prey of the rapacious birds, particularly the shrikes. The eggs are greenish white, and marked with two kinds of spots; some obscure and hardly visible, scatter∣ed equally over the surface; others deeper and well defined, most frequent near the thick end. "It constantly makes its nest," says Belon, "in some garden herb or bush, such as hemlock and the like, or behind a garden wall in the towns or villages." The inside is lined with horse-hair; but the nest observed by Belon had
<PB N="139" REF="159"/>
a hole in the bottom, which he ascribes to de∣sign, though it was probably accidental <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is lined on the inside with horse-hair, and so nicely that it is persorated like a noose; so that the excrements of the young escape, and they are always preserved clean." <HI>Nat. des Ois.</HI> p. 341.</NOTE>; for this is contrary to the general construction, which is calculated to collect and concentrate the heat.</P>
<P>The same naturalist hits better when he says that the plumage of this little warbler is uni∣form, and the same with that of the nightin∣gale's tail. The comparison is happy; and will save us a minute description. We shall only observe, that there is a little rufous shading the great coverts of the wings, and more faintly spread through the webs of their quills, with a very dilute and light tinge of rusty on the gray of the back and head, and on the whitish co∣lour of the sides. This bird is therefore impro∣perly styled <HI>the rusous,</HI> since only a few parts of its plumage are dashed slightly with it.</P>
<P>Its total length is only four inches eight lines; its alarextent six inches ten lines: it is one of the smallest of the genus, being inferior even to the passerine warbler. But Belon seems to exaggerate when he says, "that it is hardly so big as the end of the finger." <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Motacilla Rufa:</HI> "It is gray rusous, below tawny; a longitudinal streak on its temples; the quills of its wings and tail tawny."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE plumage of the fauvettes is common∣ly uniform and unvaried. The present is distinguished by some black spots on the breast; but the rest of its plumage is similar to that of the rest of the genus. It is of the size of the second species, or the passerine warbler; its length five inches four lines, and its wings when closed cover half the tail: all its mantle from the crown of the head to the origin of the tail is variegated with rusty brown, yellowish and cinereous: the quills of the wings are blackish, edged exteriorly with white: those of the tail are the same: the breast is yellowish, marked with black spots: the throat, the fore part of the neck, the belly, and the sides are white.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="161"/>
This warbler is more common in Italy, and probably in the southern provinces of France, than in the northern countries, where it is little known.

<P>It builds in the meadows, and places its nest within a foot of the ground in some large plant, as fennel, chervil, &amp;c.

are much deeper than those of the others: its general complexion is blackish, and all its quills and feathers are bordered with rufous brown: its cheeks, its throat, the fore part of its neck and breast are of a blueish cinereous: there is a rusty spot on the temple: the belly is white. Its size is that of the red-breast; its alar extent eight inches. The cock differs from the hen, in having more of the rufous cast on the head and neck, and the latter being more stained with cinereous.</P>
<P>These birds perform their migrations in bo∣dies: they arrive in the end of October, and the beginning of November: they alight on the hedges, and go from bush to bush, always near the ground, and hence their name of <HI>trail∣bush (traîne-buisson).</HI> It is not timorous, and is easily ensnared <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. It has neither the shyness nor the vivacity of the other fauvettes, and its disposition seems to participate of the cold and torpor of the season.</P>
<P>Its usual strain is quivering; it is a sort of soft shake <HI>tittit-tititit,</HI> which it often repeats. It has also a slender warble, which, though mournful and little varied, is pleasant to hear in a season when all the other songsters are silent: this is the most frequent and lengthened towards evening. In the depth of winter, the hedge-sparrow haunts
<PB N="144" REF="166"/>
the barns and threshing-floors, to pick up the fine meal from among the chaff. Hence pro∣bably the name <HI>chaff-scraper (gratte-paille),</HI> which is given to it in Brie. Hebert says, that he found whole grains of wheat in its craw; but its slender bill is not calculated for such food, and necessity alone can compel it to that resource. As soon as the cold obates, it again retires to the hedges, searching on the branches for the chrysalids, and dead vine∣fretters.</P>
<P>It disappears in the spring; whether that it penetrates into the forests and returns to the mountains, as in Lorraine, where I am inform∣ed that it breeds; or whether it migrates into other climates, particularly towards the north, from whence it seems to come in the autumn, and where it is very frequent in sum∣mer. In England, according to Albin, it is found during the warm weather in every bush. It inhabits Sweden; and the epithet which Lin∣naeus applies, seems to shew that it continues during the winter, and assumes the white plumage common in the northern climates in that season <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Passer Canus.</HI> Syst. Nat. edit. vi.</NOTE>. It also breeds in Germany; but its nest is very rarely found in France: it is placed near the ground, or even on the surface, and it consists of moss, lined with wool and
<PB N="145" REF="167"/>
hair: it usually contains four or five eggs of a pleasant uniform light blue, without any spots. When a cat, or any mischievous animal, hap∣pens to come near the nest, the mother will divert it from the spot by an instinct similar to that by which the partridge misleads the dog; she springs up, flutters from spot to spot, till her enemy is removed to a safe distance. Albin says, that in England the young are hatched against the month of May, that they are easily raised, that they are not timorous, and even be∣come very familiar; and lastly, that their warble is esteemed, though not so cheerful as that of the other fauvettes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A winter fauvette kept during that season at the house of M. Daubenton the younger, and caught in a snare in autumn, was not wilder than if it had been taken from the nest. It was put into a volery filled with canaries, linnets, and goldfinches. A canary took such a liking to this fauvette that he would never leave it; and M. Daubenton was induced to remove them from the general volery, and put them by themselves in a breeding-cage. But this attachment seemed to be friendship only, and not love; they did not copulate, nor is it likely that their union would have been productive.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their leaving France in the spring, and their plenty in the northern regions during that sea∣son, are singular facts in the history of the mi∣gration of birds. After the grashopper warbler, this is the second species with a slender bill,
<PB N="146" REF="168"/>
which retires from the heats of our summers, and yet supports the rigours of our winters, which all the rest of the genus shun: and this instinct alone is sufficient to distinguish it, or at least to set it at a small distance from the others.</P>

<HEAD>THE ALPINE FAUVETTE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS bird is found on the Alps and the high mountains of Dauphiné and Au∣vergne: it is at least as large as the common bunting, and therefore in point of size it far exceeds the fauvettes; but still it is con∣nected to them by many marked characters. Its throat is white, spotted with two different tints of brown: its breast is ash gray: all the rest of its body is variegated with gray, more or less inclined to whitish, and with rufous: the in∣ferior coverts of its tail are marked with blackish and white: the upper part of its head and neck is ash gray: its back is of the same colour, but variegated with brown: the superior coverts of
<PB REF="169"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="147" REF="170"/>
its wings are blackish, spotted with white to the point: the quills of its wings are brown, edged exteriorly, the large ones with whitish, the mid∣dle ones with rusty colour: the superior coverts of its tail are brown edged with greenish gray, and rusty near the point: all the quills of its tail are terminated above by a rusty spot on the in∣ner side: its bill is eight lines in length, black∣ish above, yellow below at the base, and not scalloped: its feet are yellowish: the <HI>tarsus</HI> is an inch long: the hind nail is much thicker than the rcst: the tail is two inches and a half long, somewhat forked, and exceeds the wings near an inch. The whole length of the bird is seven inches: the tongue is forked; the <HI>aesophagus</HI> is rather more than three inches, and it dilates into a sort of glandulous sac before its insertion into the gizzard, which is very thick, and an inch long, and eight lines broad: it is muscular, and lined loosely by a membrane: it generally contains fragments of insects, dif∣ferent small seeds, and minute gravel. The left lobe of the liver, which covers the gizzard, is smaller than usual in birds: there is no gall∣bladder, but two <HI>caeca</HI> of a line and an half cach: the intestinal tube is ten or twelve inches long.</P>
<P>Though these birds inhabit the Alpine tracts which lie between France and Italy, and even
<PB N="148" REF="171"/>
those in Auvergne and Dauphiné, no au∣thor has mentioned them. The Marquis de Piolenc sent several to M. Gueneau de Mont∣beillard, which were killed at his barony of Mont∣bel, 18th January 1778. They never remove far from the lofty mountains, unless they be compelled to retreat by the abundance of snow: accordingly, they are hardly seen in the low country. They are generally on the ground, and run swiftly, scudding along like the quail and the partridge, and not hopping as the other fauvettes do. They also sit upon stones, but seldom perch on trees: they wander in small bodies, and recall each other by a feeble cry like that of the wagtail. When the cold is moderate, they live in the fields; but when it becomes more severe, they resort to the moist meadows where there is moss, and are then seen running on the ice. Their last resource is the tepid springs and brooks: they are often found in such situations when the person is hunting for snipes. They are not shy; yet are they difficult to kill, especially on the wing.</P>

<HEAD>THE PITCHOU. Motacilla Provincialis, <HI>Gmel.</HI> The Dartford Warbler, <HI>Lath.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS name is, in Provence, applied to a very small bird, which appears to us more related to the fauvettes than to any other genus. Its total length is five inches, of which the tail takes up near the one half. It probably received this appellation because it conceals it∣self among cabbage <HI>(chou):</HI> it searches for the young butterflies that are bred on the leaves, and in the evening it squats and hides itself from its enemy, the bat, which roves above its cold lodging. But several persons have assured me, that <HI>pitchou</HI> has no relation to <HI>chou,</HI> and signifies only <HI>little</HI> or <HI>slender;</HI> which agrees with Italian etymology <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piccino, Piccinino.</NOTE>, and suits well this bird, which is almost as small as a wren.</P>
<P>The bill of the pitchou is long in compari∣son to its body, being seven lines: it is blackish at the tip, whitish at the base: the upper man∣dible is scalloped near the end: the wing is very
<PB N="150" REF="173"/>
short, and covers only the origin of the tail: the <HI>tarsus</HI> is eight lines: the nails are very thin, and the hind one is the largest: all the upper part of the body, from the forehead to the end of the tail, is deep cinereous: the quills of the tail, and the great quills of the wings, are edged with light cinereous on the outside, and blackish within.—We are indebted to M. Guys of Mar∣seilles for our knowledge of this bird.</P>

<P>THIS bird, described by Brisson, is one of the largest, since he makes it equal to the brambling, and seven inches three lines long. The crown of the head is rufous, variegated with blackish spots in the middle of the feathers: the top of the neck, the back and the shoulders are clouded, except that their edge is dirty gray: near the rump, on the coverts of the wings, and the upper surface of the tail, they are edged with rufous: all the under and fore part of the body is rusty white, variegated with some blackish spots on the flanks: on each side of the throat there is a small black stripe: the quills of the wings are brown, with the outer border rufous: the four quills in the middle of the tail are similar, the rest are rufous, but all

<P>IT is of the size of the tit-lark, and resem∣bles it in the manner in which all the under

part of the body is spotted with blackish on a yellowish white ground; these spots reach from near the eyes to the sides of the tail: a streak of white rises at the angle of the bill, and ter∣minates in the eye: all the upper surface, from the crown of the head to the end of the tail, is mixed with cinereous and deep brown.</P>
<P>We should not have hesitated to refer to this species, as a variety proceeding from age or sex, another fauvette which was also sent from Louisiana, of which the plumage is a lighter gray, and has only a few traces of the spots which are distinctly painted on the former: the upper part of the body is whitish; a vestige of a yellowish tinge appears on the sides, and the rump: besides, these two birds are of the same size; the quills and the great coverts of the wings in the last are fringed with whitish; but an essential difference takes place in their bills: in the first, it is as large as the reed fauvette, and in the second, it is hardly equal to that of the small fauvette. This diversity in the prin∣cipal part appears to be specific, and we shall therefore constitute this another species, under the name of SHADED FAUVETTE FROM LOU∣ISIANA <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Motacilla Umbria, <HI>Gmel.</HI></P>

It is of the size of the passerine warbler. It was brought from Louisiana by Lebeau.</P>
<P>A fourth species is the <HI>Greenish Fauvette</HI> from the same country. It is of the size of the spot∣ted fauvette, which we have just described: its bill is as long, and is stronger: its throat is white; the under part of the body white gray; a white streak passes below the eye, and beyond it: the crown of the head is blackish; the upper side of the neck is deep ash colour; the flanks and the back are greenish, on a light brown ground; a purer greenish borders the quills of the tail, and the outside of those of the wings, whose ground is blackish.

<P>SUCH is the name <HI>(cou-jaune)</HI> which the settlers in St. Domingo have bestowed on a small bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They also call it <HI>the goldfinch:</HI> yet the yellow-neck has the slender bill of the pettychaps, or red-breast, and the port, the temper, and habits of the latter; nor has it any thing analogous to the goldfinch but the warble, which is also very different.</NOTE>, which to beauty of plumage joins an easy shape and a pleasant warble: it sits upon the trees which are in blossom, and strains its little throat: its voice is slender and weak, but varied and delicate; each passage of its music is composed of rich and full cadences <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The song of the <HI>corn or cane bird</HI> resembles in the thinness of its tones, and the quality of its modulation, the warble of the yellow-neck." <HI>Note of M. Lefevre Deshayes,</HI> an ingenious and sensible observer, to whom we owe the details in this article, and many other interesting facts in the natural history of the birds of St. Domingo.</NOTE>. The bird is the more charming, as its song lasts not only spring, the season of love, but is prolonged through almost all the months of the year. We should almost suppose that its passion suffers no
<PB N="159" REF="182"/>
intermission; and, in that case, it might be in∣cessantly fired to warble its amorous tale. As soon as the weather grows fine, especially after those sudden and excessive torrents of rain which are so frequent in the West Indies, the male tunes his voice, and chants whole hours together: the female also sings; but her notes are neither so well supported, nor so finely blended.</P>
<P>Nature, who paints most of the birds in the New World with the richest colours, denies them the charms of song, and, in the desert tracts, she bestows only some savage cries. They yellow-neck is one of the small number whose warble is lively and cheerful, and whose plumage is at the same time distinguished for beauty: the tints are well blended, and are heightended by the fine yellow which spreads over the throat, the neck, and the breast: black gray predominates on the head, and, growing more dilute as it descends to the neck, it changes into a deep gray on the back: there is a white line which crowns the eye, and joins to a small yellow streak lying between the eye and the bill: the belly is white, and the sides are speckled with white and black gray: the coverts of the wings are spotted with black and white, disposed in hori∣zontal stripes; there are also large white spots on the quills, of which there are sixteen in each wing, and with a small white gray border at
<PB N="160" REF="183"/>
the end of the great webs: the tail consists of twelve quills, of which the four outer ones are marked with large white spots: a scaly fine skin, of a greenish gray, covers the legs: the bird is four inches and nine lines in length; its alar extent eight inches, and it weighs one gros and a half.</P>
<P>Under this rich clothing, the pensile warbler has the figure and proportions of the fauvettes; and its habits are also the same. It prefers for its haunts the sides of rivulets, and the cool refreshing spots near springs, and wet gullies; whether because a mild temperature is most congenial to its nature, or that it seeks retire∣ment where nothing may disturb its music. It flutters from tree to tree, and from branch to branch, and warbles in its passage through the air. It preys on flies, caterpillars, and butter∣flies; and yet, in the season, it cracks the seeds of the guava and water melon, &amp;c. probably to find the maggots which are bred in these at a certain state of maturity. It appears neither to arrive in St. Domingo nor depart: its flight, though rapid, is not so lofty, nor so continued, as to waft it over the ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Deshayes compares the slight of the yellow-neck to that of the bird called at St. Domingo <HI>de la Toussaint (All-Saints),</HI> seemingly because it arrives about that time. "It is nearly of the size," says he, "of the yellow-neck; but this is very delicate in comparison, and the muscles of its wings are much less vigorous than in the bird <HI>de la Tous∣saint."</HI></NOTE>, and it may be re∣garded as a native of that island.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="184"/>
But the beauty and sensibility of this bird are no less remarkable than the sagacity it displays in building and placing its nest. It does not fix it at the forking of the branches, as usual with most other birds; it suspends it to binders hanging from the netting, which they form from tree to tree, especially those which fall from branches leaning over the rivers and deep ra∣vines: the nest consists of dry blades of grass, the ribs of leaves, and exceedingly small roots, in∣terwoven with the greatest art; it is fastened, or rather it is worked into the pendent strings; it is really a small bed rolled into a ball, so thick and compacted as to exclude the rain, and which rocks in the wind without receiving any harm.</P>
<P>But the elements are not the only enemies against which this bird has to struggle: with won∣derful sagacity it provides for its protection from other foes: the opening is not made on the top or side of the nest, but at the bottom; nor is the entrance direct: after the bird has made its way into the vestibule, it must pass another aperture before it descends into the abode of its family: this lodgment is round and soft, and lined with a sort of lichen which grows on the trees, or
<PB N="162" REF="185"/>
with the silk of a plant called by the Spaniards <HI>mort à cabaye</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is a plant which grows in the savannas of St. Do∣mingo, and delights in humid situations: its milk is a strong poison, which is no doubt the reason of its name, <HI>mort à cabaye." Note de M. le Chev. Deshayes.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>By this laborious construction, the young brood are protected against the attacks of the rapacious birds, and of the rats and snakes. Yet dangers still await them: when they are about to fly, many are devoured by the owls and rats, and the species ever remains limited. Such is the fate of the weak and gentle creatures in those regions, where the noxious kinds spread and prevail by their numbers.</P>
<P>The female lays only three or four eggs; she hatches more than once in the year, but how often is not known: the young ones are seen in the month of June, and some are said to appear as early as March, and others are found in the end of August, or in September; they soon leave their mother, but never rove far from the place of their nativity. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Motacilla Pensilis:</HI> "It is gray, below yellow, its belly and eyebrows white, its straps spotted with yellow, the coverts of its wings marked with alternate stripes of black and white."</NOTE></P>

<P>THE song of this bird has neither the ex∣tent nor the variety of the nightingale's warble; but it partakes of the same modula∣tions, and wears an air of tenderness and me∣lancholy. Such at least are the emotions which this awakens in us; for, with regard to the bird itself, it must be the expression of joy and pleasure, as it is the expression of love, which is equally delicious to every animated being. This is the only analogy that subsists between the two
<PB N="164" REF="187"/>
birds; their habits, their size, their plumage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE> are different, though in French the same generic name of <HI>nightingale</HI> has been usually applied to both.</P>
<P>This bird appears with the rest in the spring, and sits on towers and the ruins of deserted buildings, and there it pours forth its notes. It even procures solitude in the midst of cities, where it settles on the top of a high wall, in a belfry, on a chimney, &amp;c. always seeking the most lofty and most inaccessible spots: it is also found in the heart of the thickest forests. It flies nimbly; and when it perches it vents a feeble cry <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id.</NOTE>, and quivers its tail incessantly, not upwards and downwards, but horizontally, from right to left. It prefers the mountainous tracts, and seldom visits the plains <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. It is much smaller than the nightingale, and even some∣thing smaller than the redbreast; its form is more slender, and longer; a black horse-shoe covers its throat, the fore part and sides of its neck; the same black encircles its eyes, and reaches under its bill; a white bar masks its face: the crown and back of its head, the upper part of its neck and back, are of a glossy, but deep gray: in some subjects, probably old ones, this gray is almost black: the wing quills are blackish cinereous; their outer webs are of
<PB N="165" REF="188"/>
a lighter cast, and fringed with whitish gray: below the black horse-shoe, a fine rufous fire colour decorates a great part of the breast; and, fading somewhat on the sides, it again resumes its lustre on all the plumage of the tail, except the two middle feathers, which are brown; the belly is white, and the feet black; the tongue is forked at the end, as in the nightingale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The female differs so much from the male, that some authors have reckoned it a second species <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus and Klein.</NOTE>: it has neither the white face nor the black throat of the latter; both these parts are gray mixed with rusty, and the rest of the plu∣mage is of a lighter tinge.</P>
<P>These birds breed both in towns and in the country, in hollow trees or in the crags of rocks: they lay five or six blue eggs: the young are hatched in May <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. During the whole time of incubation, the male chants from some neighbouring eminence, or from the top of a detached building <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Olina, <HI>Uccell.</HI> p. 47.</NOTE>; and his music is softest at day-break <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus, t. ii. p. 750.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is said that these birds are timorous and sus∣picious, and that they will abandon their nest, if they be seen employed in constructing it, and that they will desert the eggs if they be touched. All this is probable; but what Albin adds is
<PB N="166" REF="189"/>
absurd; that if the young be handled, the pa∣rents will leave them to their fate, or throw them out of their nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin, vol. i. p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The redstart, though it lives amidst our dwellings, continues still savage. It has neither the familiarity of the redbreast, the sprightliness of the fauvette, nor the animation of the night∣ingale; its habits are solitary, its character is sul∣len and sad <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Their young much resemble those of the redbreasts; they cannot be so easily raised.

However, if it be taken from the nest and raised in the cage, it will sing; and instructions, or the imitation of other birds, will improve its warble <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Idem, ibidem.</NOTE>, which is heard indiscriminately at every hour, and even during the night <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Olina, <HI>Uccelleria,</HI> p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is fed with crumbs of bread, and with the same paste as the nightingale; it is even more delicate <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. When at liberty, it lives on flies,
<PB N="167" REF="190"/>
spiders, the chryfalids of ants, small berries, and soft fruits. In Italy it pecks the figs; and Olina tells us that it is seen in that country as date as the month of November, though in France it disappears in October. It departs when the redbreast begins to visit our habita∣tions; and this is the reason perhaps that Aristotle and Pliny assert that the redbreast of winter, and the redstart of summer, are the same bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arist. <HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 49.—Plin. lib. x. 29.—Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 347, 348.</NOTE>. Even in their migrations, the redstarts shew their solitary disposition; they never as∣semble in flocks, but arrive and depart singly <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"This year I took a walk into the park one day when there was probably a numerous flight, for I sprung them every minute from the hedge-rows, and almost always one by one.

These birds are very common at Nańtua in the spring and summer, and probably leave the mountains in the beginning of autumn, but without settling in our plains, where it is very rare to see them at any other season." <HI>Note communicated by M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are varieties of the redstart; some derived from climate, others occasioned by age. Aldrovandus mentions three; but the first is a female, and the second is an imperfect figure from Gesner, and only the bird disguised; the third only is a true variety; it has a long white streak on the fore part of the head: this is what
<PB N="168" REF="191"/>
Brisson calls the <HI>cinereous redstart,</HI> and which Willughby and Ray describe from Aldrovan∣dus. Frisch mentions another variety of the hen redstart, in which the breast is marked with rufous spots; and this variety constitutes Klein's second species. The gray redstart of Edwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Motacilla Gibraltariensis, <HI>Gmel.</HI></NOTE>, sent from Gibraltar to Catesby, and which Bris∣son makes his second species, is probably only a variety of climate. It is of the same size with the common redstart; the greatest difference is, that there are no rufous tints on its breast, and that the outer edges of the middle quills of its wing are white.</P>
<P>Another variety nearly the same is the bird sent to us by M. D'Orcy, in which the black co∣lour of the throat spreads over the breast and sides; whereas in the common redstart these parts are rufous. We do not know whence M. D'Orcy received it: it had a white spot on the wing, of which the quills are blackish; all the cinereous cast of the upper part of the body is deeper than in the redstart, and the white of the forehead is much less apparent.</P>
<P>There is besides in America a species of red∣start described by Catesby, which we shall leave undecided, and not ranged expressly with that of Europe; not so much because of the differ∣ence of characters, as of the wide separation be∣tween

the continents. In fact, Catesby ascribes to the Virginian redstart the same habits which we survey in our own. It lives in the closest woods; it is seen only in summer: its head, neck, back and wings are black, except a small spot of vivid rufous on its wing; the rufous colour of the breast is divided into two by the continuation of the gray of the stomach; the point of its tail is black. Are these differences specific, and more marked than what might be expected from the influence of another hemi∣sphere?</P>

<P>ARISTOTLE mentions three small birds, and marks by the composition of the names which he applies that the principal feature of their plumage is a flame tint.

We are pretty confident that the first is the redstart, and the second the redbreast; indeed the habits which Aristotle ascribes to these, that the for∣mer lives in the summer near our habitations, and disappears in autumn when the latter ar∣rives, can belong to no other birds which have
<PB N="172" REF="195"/>
a rutilous plumage, but the redstart or red-breast. It will be more difficult to ascertain the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>rubicilla.</HI> These names have been applied by all the nomenclators to the bulfinch: their opinion was noticed, but not discussed, at that article; and we shall now resume the sub∣ject, and state the reasons which dispose us to make a very different conclusion.</P>
<P>Aristotle enumerates at this place the small birds, with a slender bill, which live chiefly on vegetables; such are, says he, the <HI>cygalis,</HI> the <HI>beccafico</HI> (or epicurean warbler), the <HI>melancory∣phus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that Belon and many naturalists after him, have referred also to the bulsinch the name of <HI>melancory∣phus;</HI> but I am convinced that this application is erroneous. Aristotle speaks in two places of the <HI>melancoryphus,</HI> and in both he alludes to two different birds, neither of them the bulsinch: in the first passage we shall prove that he means the <HI>pyrrhulas;</HI> in the second, it is said <HI>to lay twenty eggs, to nestle in hollow trees, and to feed on insects,</HI> which character is true only of the black-headed titmouse.—This little discussion seemed to me the more necessary, as Belon has of all the naturalists discovered the most sagacity in re∣ferring the ancient names, and as the nomenclature is ex∣ceedingly embarrassing.</NOTE> (or black-cap), the <HI>pyrrhulas,</HI> the <HI>ery∣thacus,</HI> the <HI>hypolaïs</HI> (the babbling warbler): but I ask whether the bulfinch can be classed with these; or is not that bird the most decidedly granivorous? It will not touch insects in the season when most others feed upon them; and
<PB N="173" REF="196"/>
it seems to differ as much from the vermivorous birds by its instincts as by the shape of its bill: and it is not likely that Aristotle would over∣look this circumstance.</P>
<P>To what other bird, then, can we ascribe these properties? I perceive none but the <HI>red∣tail,</HI> which inhabits the woods with the red-breast, and also feeds on insects during the whole summer, and departs at the same time in winter. Wotton conceived that the pyrrhulas was a kind of red-tail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apud Gesnerum,</HI> p. 701.</NOTE>, and Johnston makes the same remark <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pyrrhulas, <HI>Johnst.</HI></NOTE>; but the former was mistaken in supposing this bird to be the redstart, since Aristotle nicely distinguishes them.</P>
<P>The red-tail is actually very different from the redstart, and Aristotle and Gesner did well to separate them. It is larger than the redstart: it never visits our dwellings, nor nestles in the walls; but lives in the woods and bushes like the fauvettes and beccafigos: its tail is of a light vivid fire colour; the rest of the plumage consists of gray, especially on all the upper surface, and deeper and fringed with rusty on the quills of the wings, and with white gray, mixed confusedly with rusty, on all the fore part of the body: the rump is rufous, and so is the tail. Some have a fine black collar, and
<PB N="174" REF="197"/>
the colours over the whole of their plumage more lively and varied. Brisson has formed these into a second species <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phoenicurus Torquatus.</NOTE>; but we conceive that they are only the males, and some very ex∣perienced bird-fanciers have confirmed our opinion. Brisson says, that the collared red-tail is <HI>found in Germany,</HI> as if it were peculiar to that country: but wherever the gray red-tails occur, the collared red-tails are equally frequent. Besides, he is mistaken in his reference; for the figure in Frisch, which he supposes to be the red-tail, is only the female of the blue-throated warbler.</P>
<P>We regard the collared red-tail, therefore, as the male, and the gray red-tail as the female: in both, the tail is equally red; but, besides the collar, the male has a deeper plumage, being a brown gray on the back, and gray spotted with brown on the breast and sides.</P>
<P>These birds prefer the hilly countries, and scarcely appear in the low grounds, except in their autumnal passage <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"I have seen in Brie, in autumn, a bird which like∣wise had a very rufous tail, but different from the red∣start: I thought it was the same with the <HI>collier</HI> of Nantua in its first year. Almost all these birds change their colour the first moulting, and all the bird which feed on insects are subject to migrations in autumn." <HI>Note communicated by M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>. They arrive in the month of May in Burgundy and Lorraine,
<PB N="175" REF="198"/>
and soon bury themselves in the woods, where they remain all the summer. They breed in the small bushes near the ground; their nest consists of moss, and lined with wool and fea∣thers; it is of a spherical shape, with its opening facing the east, and the most sheltered from the stormy winds; it contains five or six eggs, va∣riegated with gray.</P>
<P>The red-tails leave the woods in the morning, and return to avoid the heat of the day; they emerge in the evening, and appear in the neigh∣bouring fields, but again return to their abodes to pass the night. These habits, and many other features of resemblance, seem to imply that they belong to the genus of the redstart. The red-tails, however, have neither its song nor its warble; they utter only a feeble mellow note <HI>sũit,</HI> and it dwells on the first syllable, and spins it out with great softness. They are in general silent, and exceedingly composed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A red-tail taken in autumn and let loose in an apartment, made not the smallest cry, whether flying, walking, or resting. Shut in the same cage with a petty chaps, the latter darted every minute against the bars, while the former remained still whole hours in the same place, where the pettychaps dropped upon it at each spring; and it suffered itself to be thus trod upon all the time the pettychaps lived, that is, about thirty-six hours.</NOTE>: if a small detached branch projects from a bush or stretches across a path, they will alight on it,

<P>It answers the decoy, but does not rush on with the vivacity and eagerness of other birds; it seems only to follow the crowd. It is also caught near springs about the end of autumn; and it is then very fat, and has a delicate flavour. Its flight is short, and reaches only from bush to bush.—These birds depart in the month of October; they may for several days be seen following each other along the hedges; but after that time none of them remain in France. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Red-tail, <HI>Motacilla-Eritha∣cus:</HI> "Its back and its wing quills are cinereous, its belly and tail quills rusous, the two outermost cinereous."

<P>THIS bird, which, like the ortolan, is es∣teemed by the luxurious as the highest delicacy, is not remarkable for its beauty.

<P>These birds are natives of the south, and seem to visit our climate only to wait the maturity of the figs; they arrive late in the spring, and disappear before the earliest frosts of autumn. However, they spread in the sum∣mer over a great extent in the northern coun∣tries; for they are found in England <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, in Ger∣many <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Klein.</NOTE>, in Poland <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynski.</NOTE>, and even in Sweden <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>. They return in autumn to Italy and Greece, and probably advance to winter in still warmer regions. They seem to change their habits with their climate; for, in the countries of the south, they appear in flocks; while, in the temperate climates, they remain always dis∣persed: they inhabit the woods, feed on in∣sects, and live in solitude, or rather in the en∣dearing society of their female. Their nests are so artfully concealed, that it is very difficult to discover them <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">"The beccafigo nestles in our forests, and, to judge from analogy, in the holes of trees at a great height above the ground, like the collared fly-catchers: for this reason are very difficult to be found.

It had a feeble chirrup like the wheat-ear, by no means agreeable. It perched extremely high, and seldom came near the ground." <HI>Note communicated by M. Lottinger.</HI></NOTE>: during that season, the
<PB N="179" REF="202"/>

The epi∣curean warblers arrive in Lorraine in April, and disappear in August, and sometimes later <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lottinger.</NOTE>. In that province, they are called <HI>mulberry-birds,</HI> or <HI>little wood-finches</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mûriers,</HI> or <HI>petits pinçons des bois.</HI></NOTE>, which has tended to mislead; for, at the same time, the name of <HI>fig-pecker</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bec-figue.</NOTE> has been bestowed on the tit-lark, which is of a very different species. Nor are these the only mistakes that have been made in regard to the name. Belon presumes, because the bulfinch in Italy seems fond of figs, that it is the same bird with what is called in that country <HI>beccafico,</HI> and he infers that it is the real <HI>ficedula,</HI> to which Martial alludes. But the bulfinch is as different from the epicurean warbler in the taste of its flesh, which is bitter, as in the shape of its bill, in its colours, and in the rest of its figure. In our southern provinces, and in Italy, all the different species of fau∣vettes
<PB N="180" REF="203"/>
are confounded under the name of fig-pecker, and almost all these birds have a slender long bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>; but the true fig-pecker, or epicurean warbler, is also well known and distinguished for the delicacy of its flavour.</P>
<P>Martial, who asks why this small bird, which feeds alike on grapes and on figs, did not assume the name of the former rather than that of the lat∣ter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Cum me ficus alat, cum pascar dulcibus uvis, Cur potius nomen non dedit uva mihi?" MART.</NOTE>, would have adopted the appellation which it receives in Burgundy, where we call it <HI>vinette;</HI> because it frequents vineyards, and lives on the grapes. Along with these, however, it eats insects also, and the seeds of the herb mer∣cury. Its seeble chirp may be expressed by <HI>bzi, bzi;</HI> it flies by jerks; it walks, but never hops, and it runs along the ground in the vine∣yards, and mounts upon vines and hedge en∣closures.</P>
<P>Though the epicurean warblers never jour∣ney till about the month of August, and never appear in flocks but then, in most of our pro∣vinces; yet they are seen in the middle of sum∣mer at Brie, where some of them probably build their nests <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hebert.</NOTE>. In their passage, they fly in small bodies of five or six. They are caught
<PB N="181" REF="204"/>
by the noose, the springe, or the mirror, in Burgundy and along the Rhone, where they make their appearance about the end of August, and in September.</P>
<P>It is in Provence where they are properly named fig-peckers, for they are constantly seen on the fig-trees pecking the ripest fruit. They never leave these, except for the shade and cover of the bushes and of the leafy horn∣heam. They are caught in great numbers during the month of September in Provence, and in many islands of the Mediterranean, es∣pecially in Malta, where they appear at times in prodigious flocks; and it has been remarked that they are much more numerous during their passage in autumn, than at their return in spring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chevalier de. Mazy.</NOTE>. The same is the case at Cyprus, where sormerly they were articles of traffic: they were sent to Venice, in pots filled with vinegar and odoriferous herbs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Voyage de Pietro della Valle,</HI> t. viii. p. 153. He adds, that in some places, as at <HI>Agia Nappa,</HI> those who eat bec∣casigos are sometimes attacked by disorders, owing to the scammony which these birds find in the neighbourhood; they feed also, in the islands of the Archipelago, on the fruits of the lentisc.</NOTE>. When Cy∣prus belonged to the Venetians, a thousand or twelve hundred of these pots were furnished
<PB N="182" REF="205"/>
every year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dapper's Description of the Archipelago Islands.</NOTE>; and the fig-pecker, or epicurean warbler, was generally known through Italy by the name of <HI>Cyprus bird (Cyprias, uccello di Cy∣pro),</HI> which appellation, according to Willugh∣by, was usual even in England.</P>
<P>This delicious bird has long been famous: Apicius mentions it more than once, with the little thrush, as both equally exquisite. Eusta∣thius and Athenaeus speak of the fowling for epicurean warblers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Gesner.</NOTE>, and Hesychius preserves the name of a net with which they were caught in Greece. Nothing indeed is more delicate or juicy than the meat of these birds at the proper season; it is a pellet of light, savoury, melting fat, of easy digestion; it is the extract of all the juices of the excellent fruits on which they feed.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with only one species, though the name has been bestowed on several <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus gives (t. ii. p. 759) two figures of the fig-pecker, of which the second, according to himself, exhi∣bits only a variety of the first, perhaps even accidental, and which, he says, may be called <HI>the variegated fig-pecker, black and white being mixed through its whole plumage, as the figure shews:</HI> but this figure shews only in that the white on the wing is a little broader, and there is some white on the fore side of the neck and on the breast; which constitutes only an individual variety.</NOTE>. If indeed we call every bird <HI>fig-pecker</HI> which pecks
<PB N="183" REF="206"/>
the figs in that season, the fauvettes and all the birds with slender bills, and even some with thick bills, would be entitled to that appellation. Hence the Italian proverb, <HI>Nel' mese d' Agosto ogni uccello e beccafico</HI> (In the month of August every bird is a fig-pecker). But this vulgar saying, which very well expresses the delicacy of flavour that the figs give to the little birds which feed on them, would be a very vague and improper foundation for arrangement; and were it adopt∣ed, it would introduce the greatest confusion. Yet some naturalists have fallen into this error. <HI>The hemp fig-pecker</HI> of Olina <HI>(beccafico canapino)</HI> is only the babbling warbler. The great war∣bler, or the pettychaps, is according to Ray, called <HI>beccafigo</HI> in Italy. Belon applies the same name to the rufous warbler; and we have just seen that he is still more mistaken in sup∣posing that term belonged also to the <HI>bulfinch,</HI> to which he is, by consequence, led to assign the ancient appellations of the fig-pecker <HI>sycalis</HI> and <HI>ficedula.</HI> In Provence, several different birds are confounded under the name of fig-pecker.

<P>THIS little bird passes the whole summer in our woods, and visits our habitations only at its departure in autumn, and its arrival in spring: but this last appearance is transient; it hastens to the forests to enjoy, under the new∣spread foliage, its solitude and its love. Its nest is placed near the ground, on the roots of young trees, or on herbs that are able to sup∣port it; it is constructed with moss, intermixed with hair and oak leaves, and lined with feathers. Often after this is built, says Willugh∣by, the bird strews it with leaves, preserving only a narrow winding entrance under the
<PB N="186" REF="210"/>
heap, and even shuts the mouth of it with a leaf when she goes abroad. The nest generally con∣tains between five and seven eggs, of a brown co∣lour. During the whole time of incubation, the cock makes the woods resound with his light, ten∣der song: it is a sweet, delicate warble, enlivened with some brilliant modulations, and broken by graceful melting accents, which seem to be the expressions of amorous desire. The soft so∣ciety of the female fills up his wishes, and makes him uneasy at the intrusion of other company. He keenly chases all the birds of his own species, and drives them from his little settlement; and never did the same bush lodge two pairs of red∣breasts, as faithful as they are amorous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unum arbustum non alit duos erithacos.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The red-breast prefers thick shade and water∣ed spots; it feeds in the spring on worms and insects, which it hunts skilfully and nimbly. It flutters like a butterfly about a leaf where it sees a fly; and on the ground it advances by small springs, and darts on its prey, clapping its wings. In autumn, it also eats bramble-berries; and, on its departure, it feeds on the grapes of the vineyards, and on the sorbs in the woods; which is the reason that it is apt to be caught in the gins set for the thrushes, and which are baited with these small wild fruits. It resorts often to the springs, to bathe or drink,
<PB N="187" REF="211"/>
but most frequently in the autumn; for it is fat∣ter at that season than at any other, and needs more to be cooled.</P>
<P>No bird is earlier awake than the red-breast; it begins the music of the woods, welcomes the dawn of day. It also protracts its warble to the latest hour, and is seen fluttering about in the evening. It is often caught in gins after there is scarce light sufficient for taking it up. It has little shyness; and its volatility, its rest∣lessness, or its curiosity, hurry it into every sort of snare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all birds that live in the state of liberty, the red∣breast is perhaps the least shy: they often approach so near, that a person might think that he could catch them with the hand; but the bird keeps constantly retiring as he advances. It seems fond too of accompanying travellers through the forests, and it is often observed to precede or follow them a pretty long time. <HI>Note communicated by the Sieur Trecourt.</HI></NOTE>. It is always the first bird that is caught by the decoy; even the voice of the fowlers, and the noise made in cutting the branches, attract it; and it alights behind them, and is entangled by the springe or limed twig, the instant they are set. It answers equally the scream of the brown owl, or the sound of the slit leaf of ivy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The French bird-catchers call this <HI>froûet.</HI></NOTE>. Their feeble cry <HI>uîp, uîp,</HI> whistled on the finger, or the chirping of some other bird, is sufficient to put all the red-breasts round in motion. They fly to the spot, sound∣ing
<PB N="188" REF="212"/>
from a distance <HI>tirit, tiritit, tirititit,</HI> with a sonorous ringing which is not their modulated air, but what they chirp in the morning and evening, and whenever they are excited by a new object. They brush eagerly through the whole of the call-ground, till they are stopped by some of the limed twigs, which are placed in the avenues, or fastened to poles that are made low on purpose to intercept their flight, which is seldom more than four or five feet from the surface: if one disentangles itself, it makes a third small cry <HI>tî-î, tî-î,</HI> which alarms the rest, and stops their further approach. They may also be caught in the open parts of the woods by means of poles, to which are fastened nooses and limed twigs; but the springes are the most sure and successful; nor is it requisite that these be baited; we need only set them in the edge of glades, or in the middle of paths, and the un∣fortunate little bird, pushed on by curiosity, will throw itself into the snare.</P>
<P>Wherever large forests spread, the red-breasts are found in abundance. In Burgundy and Lorraine particularly these birds, which are excellent food, are obtained in the greatest numbers: many are also caught in the neigh∣bourhood of the small towns of Bourmont, Mirecourt, and Neufchâteau; and they are sent from Nancy to Paris. That province which is well wooded and watered, maintains
<PB N="189" REF="213"/>
a vast variety of birds; its situation too, bounded by the Ardenne on the one side, and skirted by the forests of Suntgau, which join the Jura, on the other, is exactly in the direction of the mi∣grations; and for this reason, the birds are most frequent in the time of their passage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 348.</NOTE>. The red-breasts in particular are brought in immense quantities from the Ardennes, where Belon saw numbers caught in the season.—This species is diffused through the whole extent of Europe, from Spain and Italy to Poland and Sweden; and in every country, these little birds prefer the mountains and the woods, to breed and spend the summer.</P>
<P>The young ones, previous to the first moult, are not painted with that fine rufous orange on the throat and breast, from which by a little straining the red-breasts derive their name. It tinges a few of the feathers by the end of Au∣gust; and before the end of September the birds have all the same plumage, and can no longer be distinguished <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"It is improperly called red-breast <HI>(rouge-gorge);</HI> for what we think to be red on the breast is orange, which rises from both sides below the bill, which is slender, taper, and black, and from below the two spaces of the eyes, and extends from the under part of the throat to the stomach." <HI>Id. ibid.</HI></NOTE>. About this time they prepare for their departure; but they never
<PB N="190" REF="214"/>
gather in flocks: they journey singly, one after another; and, when all other birds associate together, the red-breasts still retain their solitary habits. They fly during the day from bush to bush; but probably they rise higher in the night, and make more progress; at least it has hap-pened to fowlers in a forest which was full of these birds in the evening, and promised ex∣cellent sport next morning, that they were all gone before the dawn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I remember one year to have spread my nets for the red-breasts in April; and as they were very plenty, I con∣tinued the sport three days with equal success: on the sourth the sun rose brighter than ever, and the day was very mild; I expected a large capture, but they had beat their march during my absence; all were gone, and I did not take a single bird."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The departure not being marked, or, to use the expression, not being proclaimed among the red-breasts, as among the other birds at that season collected in flocks, many stay behind; and these are either the young and inexperienced, or some which can derive support from the slender re∣sources of the winter. In that season they visit our habitations, and seek the warmest and most sheltered situations <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"This bird being very delicate, and averse to excess of every kind, whether of heat or of cold, it retires in summer to the dense forests or the uplands, where it enjoys cool∣ness and verdure; in winter it approaches dwellings, and is seen among the bushes and in the gardens, especially where the sun strikes, which aspects it carefully seeks." Olina, <HI>Uccelleria,</HI> p. 16.</NOTE>; and if any one still con∣tinues
<PB N="191" REF="215"/>
in the wood, it becomes the companion of the faggot-maker, cherishes itself at his fire, pecks at his bread, and flutters the whole day round him, chirping its slender pip. But when the cold grows more severe, and thick snow covers the ground, it approaches our houses, and taps on the window with its bill, as if to entreat an asylum, which is cheerfully granted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby, <HI>Ornithol.</HI> p. 160.</NOTE>; and it repays the favour by the most amiable familiarity, gathering the crumbs from the ta∣ble <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"In a Carthusian monastery at Bugey, I saw red-breasts in the monks' cells, which they had been constrained to enter, after wandering some days in the cloisters.

They were well reconciled to the sare of the monastery; and passed thus the whole winter, protected from cold and hunger, without shewing the least desire to escape. But on the approach of spring they felt new desires; they tapped on the window with their bill; and after they recovered their liberty, they re∣turned not till next winter." <HI>Note of M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>, distinguishing affectionately the people of the house, and assuming a warble, not so rich, indeed, as that of the spring, but more delicate, and retained through all the rigours of the season, to hail each day the kindness of its

It sung whole hours with a feeble warble, sweet and melodious.</NOTE>. There it remains tranquil, till the returning spring awakens new desires, and invites to other pleasures: it now becomes uneasy, and impa∣tient to recover its liberty.</P>
<P>During this transient state of domestication, the red-breast eats almost every sort of food; it collects indifferently crumbs of bread, bits of flesh, or millet seeds. Olina asserts too gene∣rally, that, when taken from the nest, or caught in the woods, it should be fed with the same paste as the nightingale <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>: its appetite, we see, is not so delicate. Those which are allowed to fly freely about rooms, occasion but slight in∣convenience; for their excrements are small and dry. The author of the Aedonology <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 93.</NOTE> pre∣tends, that the red-breasts may be taught to speak; and this prejudice must be of an ancient date, since the same thing occurs in Porphyry <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. <HI>De Abstin. Animal.</HI></NOTE>: but the fact is quite improbable, for the tongue of the bird is forked. Belon, who never heard it except in autumn, at which time it has only the little chirp, and not its full, impassioned

song of love, yet boasts of the charms of its voice, and compares it to that of the nightin∣gale. From his own account, he appears to have taken the red-breast and the red-start for the same bird; but afterwards he distinguished them, both by their habits and by their colours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The red-start appears in the spring in towns and villages, and nestles in holes, when the red-breast has re∣tired into the woods." Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 348.</NOTE>. Those of the red-breast are very simple: a coat of the same brown as the back of the throstle covers all the upper side of its body and its head; its stomach and belly are white; the orange rufous of the breast is less vivid in the female than in the male; their eyes are black, large, and even expressive, and their aspect mild; the bill is slender and delicate as in all birds that live chiefly on insects; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> which is very small, is of a light brown, and so is the upper side of the toes, though they are of a pale yellow below. When full grown, the bird is five inches nine lines in length, and its alar extent eight inches; the intestinal tube is about nine inches long; the gizzard, which is muscular, is preceded by a dilatation of the <HI>oesophagus;</HI> the <HI>coecum</HI> is very small, and sometimes entirely wanting.

<P>IN its shape, its size, and its general appear∣ance, this bird is an exact copy of the red-breast: the only difference is, that its throat is of a brilliant azure blue, while that of the other is orange red. Even in marking the discrimi∣nation between these birds, nature seems to point at their analogy; for beneath this blue space; we may perceive a black sash and an orange red zone which bounds the top of the breast: this orange tint again appears on the first half of the lateral quills of the tail; from the corner of the bill, a streak of rusty white passes over the eye; and in general the colours, though darker, are the same with those of the red-breast. They share also the same habits, only their haunts are different: the red-breast
<PB N="196" REF="221"/>
lives in the heart of the woods; but the blue-throat frequents their skirts, and seeks marshes, wet meadows, and places that abound with willows and reeds: and with the same solitary instinct as the red-breast, it seems alike disposed to be familiar with man; for, after the sum∣mer months are spent in its sequestered retreats, it visits the gardens, avenues, and hedges, be∣fore its departure, and ventures so near that it may be shot with the trunk.</P>
<P>Like the red-breasts, they never keep in flocks, and seldom more than two are seen together. In the end of summer, says Lottinger, the blue-throats alight in the fields that are sown with large sorts of grain. Frisch mentions fields of pease as their favourite haunt, and even pre∣tends that they breed among these; but their nest is more commonly found in the willows, the osiers, and other bushes which grow in wet situations: it is formed of herbs interwoven at the origin of the branches or boughs.</P>
<P>In the love season, the male mounts perpen∣dicular to a little height in the air, chant∣ing as he rises; he whirls round, and drops back on his bough as cheerfully as the petty-chaps, of which the blue-throat seems to have some habits. He also sings in the night; and, according to Frisch, his warble is very sweet. Hermann, on the contrary, informs us, that it
<PB N="197" REF="222"/>
is not at all pleasant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor and Professor of Physic and of Natural History at Strasburg, who has been so obliging as to communicate some facts relating to the natural history of these birds.</NOTE>. This contradiction is owing, perhaps, to the different times at which these observers heard the bird; for as great difference would have been found between the ordinary chirp of our red-breast, and its mel∣low, tender song in the spring, or its pretty warble which cheers the bright days of au∣tumn.</P>
<P>The blue-throat is as fond of bathing as the red-breast, and oftener haunts the margins of water. It lives on worms and other insects; and in the season of its passage it eats elder∣berries. It may be seen among the fens, seek∣ing its food on the ground, and running briskly, and cocking its tail, especially the male, when he hears the real or imitated voice of the fe∣male.</P>
<P>The young ones are of a blackish brown, and have not assumed the blue tint of the throat; the males have only some brown feathers amidst the white of the throat and breast. The female never has the whole of the blue space on the throat; she is only marked with a crescent or a bar below the neck: and on this difference, and on the figure of Edwards, who has given
<PB N="198" REF="223"/>
the female only, Brisson makes a second species of his <HI>Gibraltar blue-throat,</HI> from which place the female seems to have come.</P>
<P>Among the adult males, some have the whole neck blue; and these are probably old ones, especially as the rest of the colours and the red zone of the breast appear deeper in these indi∣viduals. The others, which are more nume∣rous, have a spot like a half collar, of a fine white, which Frisch compares to the lustre of polished silver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus is probably mistaken when he describes this colour as a dull, yellowish white. <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></NOTE>; and, from this character, the bird-catchers at Brandenburg have applied to the blue-throat the name of <HI>mirror-bird.</HI></P>
<P>These rich colours tarnish and fade in con∣finement, and even after the first moulting. The blue-throats are caught with the noose, like the nightingales, and with the same bait. In the season when these birds are fat, they are much sought after, as are all the small birds which have delicate flesh; but they are rare, and even unknown in most of our provinces. They are seen at the time of their passage in low parts of the Vosges near Saneburg, accord∣ing to Lottinger. But another observer assures us, that they never penetrate into the heart of those mountains on the south. They are more frequent in Alsace; and though they are spread
<PB N="199" REF="224"/>
through Germany, and even as far as Prussia, they are not very common in any part, and the species seems to be much less numerous than that of the red-breasts. Yet it inhabits a wide extent: from the epithet which Barrere applies to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Motacilla Pyrenaica.</NOTE>, we may infer that it is well known among the Pyrenees. We see, from the denomination of Brisson's <HI>pretended</HI> second species, that this bird is found even at Gibraltar. It is also seen in Provence, where the people call it <HI>blue russet-bottom.</HI> And from the name which Linnaeus bestows, we might suppose that it is a native of Sweden <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Motacilla Suecica.</NOTE>; but this proves only that the blue-throat visits the northern regions. It leaves them in autumn, and travels into milder climates in quest of food; and this habit, or rather this necessity, is common to the blue∣throat, and all the birds which feed on insects, or on soft fruits. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Blue-throat, <HI>Motacilla Suecica:</HI> "Its breast is ferruginous, with a blue stripe; its tail quills dusky, and ferruginous near the base."

<P>OUR red-breast is too weak, and its flight too short, for our supposing it to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean; and, as it cannot support extreme cold, it could not penetrate into America by the northern straits. But na∣ture has produced its representative in those vast regions, which is found from Virginia and Carolina as far as Louisiana and the Ber∣muda islands. Catesby has given the first de∣scription of it, and Edwards has finished it; and both agree that it is closely related to the
<PB N="201" REF="226"/>
red-breast of Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Mr. Catesby has called this bird <HI>Rubecula Americana:</HI> which is a proper name enough, since both his bird and mine are certainly of that genus, of which the robin-red-breast is a species." <HI>Edwards.</HI></NOTE>. It is rather larger than the red-breast, being six inches three lines in length, and its alar extent ten inches eight lines. Catesby remarks, that it flies swiftly, and that its wings are long; the head, the upper side of the body, of the tail, and of the wings, is of an exceeding fine blue, except the tip of the wing, which is brown; the throat and breast are of a bright yellow rust colour; the belly is white. In some subjects, as in the one delineated by Catesby, the blue tint of the head covers the throat also: in others, as in that of Edwards, the whole fore part of the body, as far as the bill, is co∣vered with rufous. In the female, the colours are duller; the blue is mixed with blackish; the small quills of the wing, blackish, and fringed with white. The bird is of a mild dis∣position, and feeds only on insects: it nestles in the holes of trees—a difference in the mode of life suggested perhaps by the climate, where the numerous reptiles compel the birds to place the nests beyond their reach. Catesby tells us, that the blue warbler is very common through the whole of North America. That naturalist

<P>THIS sprightly, active bird is never at rest. Fluttering from bush to bush, it alights only for a few seconds; and its wings are still spread, and ready to waft it to some other spot. It rises in the air by small springs, and falls back whirling round. This continual motion has been compared to that of a mill-clack <HI>(traquet d'un moulin);</HI> and hence, according to Belon <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 360.</NOTE>, the origin of its name.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="230"/>
Though the stone-chat flies low, and never mounts to the summit of trees, it sits always on the tops of the bushes, or on the most projecting branches of the hedges and shrubs, or on the heads of Turkey wheat growing in the fields, and on the tallest props in the vineyards. It delights most in dry grounds, heaths, and up∣land meadows; and there it often utters its slender cry <HI>wistratra,</HI> in a low, smothered tone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby's <HI>Ornithology,</HI> p. 170.</NOTE>. If it finds a detached stem or a stake in these meadows, it seldom fails to perch on it, which makes it easily be caught: a lime-twig placed on a stick is sufficient for the purpose; and even the children are well acquainted with this sport.</P>
<P>From this habit of flying from bush to bush, and on thorns and brambles, Belon, who found this bird at Crete and in Greece, as well as in our provinces, applies to it the name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>bramble-bird,</HI> which Aristotle mentions once only <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist.

It spreads, growing more dilute, under the belly: the ground co∣lour
<PB N="205" REF="231"/>
of the back is a fine black, which is clouded with brown scales; and the same disposition of tints extends to the crown of the head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, where the black, however, predominates; the throat is of a pure black, only dashed with a few white waves and rises under the eyes. A white spot on the side of the neck is bounded by the black of the throat, and the bay colour of the breast; the quills of the wings and tail are blackish, fringed with brown or light rusty; there is a broad white line on the wing near the body, and the rump is of the same cast. All these tints are bolder and more intense in the old males than in the young ones; the tail is square, and somewhat spread; the bill is slender, and seven lines in length; the head is pretty round, and the body compact; the legs are black, slender, and ten lines in length; the alar extent is seven inches and a half, and the total length four inches ten lines. In the female, the breast is of a dirty rusty colour, which, mixing with the brown of the head and the upper side of the body, obtains a blackish cast on the wings, and melts into the whitish under the belly and the throat; which makes the plumage of the female appear dull, discoloured, and much less distinct than in the male.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="232"/>
The stone-chat builds its nest in waste lands, at the foot of bushes, under their roots, or be∣neath the cover of a stone, and enters it by stealth, as if afraid of being discovered: accord∣ingly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The <HI>blackfoot</HI> (stone-chat) makes its nest in concealed spots. I found one plastered against a rock, two feet from the ground, in which were five young, covered with a black down. This nest was concealed by a holm-oak, and the parents were not afraid that the cattle should approach it; but they screamed much on the neighbouring trees, when I went near." <HI>Note communicated by the Marquis de Piolenc.</HI></NOTE> the nest is difficult to be found <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"They make their nest so nicely, and frequent it so se∣cretly, that it is very difficult to be found.

Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 360.—"The nest of the stone-chat is very difficult to discover; for the windings which the bird takes in entering or leaving it, render the search almost always fruitless. It never enters but through some neigh∣bouring bushes; and when it issues forth, it flies likewise a short way among the bushes. A person might imagine, when he sees the bird dart briskly into a bush with a worm or other insect in its bill, that its nest was there; yet in vain would he look for it at that spot."</P>
<P><HI>Note communicated by the Sicur Trecourt.</HI></P></NOTE>. It breeds about the end of March, and lays <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nest found at Montbard, the 30th March.</NOTE> five or six eggs, of a blueish green, with light rufous spots, which appear obscure, but are most fre∣quent at the big end. The parents feed their young with worms and insects, which they
<PB N="207" REF="233"/>
continually carry to them: and their anxiety seems redoubled when these begin to fly; they invite them back, rally them, and scream in∣cessantly <HI>Wistratra;</HI> and for several days they still bring them food.</P>
<P>The stone-chat is very solitary, and is always seen alone, except when the season of love gives it a companion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon and Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Its disposition is wild, and its instinct dull and intractable: if it be sprightly in the state of freedom, it is as heavy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"The stone-chat is pensive: having opened the cage to one of these birds, in a garden, amidst bushes, and in a hot sun, it quickly slew to the open door, where it looked round it more than a minute before it took flight: its dissi∣dence was so great as to suspend its love of liberty."</P>

<P><PB N="208" REF="234"/>
The stone-chats are very fat in the proper season; and, for the delicacy of their flesh, they may be compared to the epicurean warblers. However, they live only on insects, and their bill seems fit for nothing but grain. Belon and Aldrovandus assert, that they are not birds of passage: this may be true with respect to Greece and Italy; but it is certain, that, in the north∣ern provinces of France, they shun the cold weather and the failure of the insects, for they depart in September.</P>

"I have never heard (says he) that they love warmth; and I believe that I have seen them remove from the fires made in the fields to burn turf, which shews that they dislike smoke." See the arti∣cle of the Red-start.</NOTE>. This feature would

<P>THE species of the whin-chat, though closely related to that of the stone-chat, ought yet to be separated from it, since both inhabit the same places without intermixing; as in Lorraine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"There is another little bird, of the bulk of the stone-chat, different from all other birds, in its habits, its flight, and in its mode of living and of building its nest; which the inhabitants of Lorraine call <HI>tarier.</HI> It lives in bushes, like the stone-chat; and has a slender bill, calculated for flies and worms: its nails, its legs, and its feet, are black; but the rest of its body resembles that of the mountain-finch, for it has a whitish spot across the wing, like the finch and the stone-chat: however, its bill and its mode of life will not permit it to be ranged with the mountain-finches.—The male has spots on his back, and round his neck; his head resembles that of the mountain-finch; the extremities of the wings and of the tail are somewhat purple, as in that finch; but the bird is less spotted: some pretend that it is a species of stone-chat."</P>
<P>Belon, <HI>Hist. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 361.</P></NOTE>, where they are very common, but
<PB N="213" REF="241"/>
live distinct. Their habits are different, as well as their plumage. The whin-chat seldom perches; it is generally on the surface, among mole-hills, in fallow grounds, and in the high pasture lands beside the woods: the stone-chat, on the con∣trary, sits always in the bushes, or on vine-props. The whin-chat is also larger than the stone-chat, its length being five inches and three lines: the colours are nearly the same, only differently dis∣tributed; in the former, the upper side of the body is marked with brighter tints, each wing has a double spot, and a white line extends from the corner of the bill to the back of the head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Will<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghby.</NOTE>; a black space lies under the eye, and covers the cheeks, but does not spread, as in the stone-chat, under the throat, which is of a light bay; this bay gradually softens, but may be distinguished on the white ground on all the fore part of the body; the rump is of the same white colour, though more intense, and speckled with black; all the upper side of the body, as far as the crown of the head, is of a black, grounded and spotted with brown; the small quills and the great coverts are black. Willughby
<PB N="214" REF="242"/>
says, that the end of the tail is white: we have observed, on the contrary, that the quills are white in their first half from the root. But that naturalist himself found varieties in that part of the plumage of the whin-chat; and mentions his having sometimes seen the two middle quills of the tail black, with a rufous border; and, at other times, with the same edging on a white ground. The female differs from the male, in its colours being paler, and the spots on the wings being not so apparent: it lays four or five eggs, of a dirty white, dotted with black <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Latham says, that the egg of the whin-chat is uniform sky blue. T.</NOTE>.—The whin-chat builds its nest like the stone-chat; it arrives and departs with it, participates of its solitary instinct, and seems even more shy and wild; it prefers the mountainous tracts, and in some places it derives its name from that circumstance: thus the Bolognese fowlers call it <HI>montanello;</HI> and the appellations which Klein <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sylvia Petrarum.</NOTE> and Gesner <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Passerculi genus solitarium.</NOTE> give to it, mark its fondness for solitude in bleak and rugged spots.

<P>THIS bird is of the size of the whin-chat, and seems closer allied to it than to the stone-chat. Like the former, it has the double white spot on each wing, and no black on the throat; but it has not the black space under the eye; nor are its great wing coverts black, being only spotted black on a brown ground: in other respects, the colours are nearly the same as in the stone-chat or whin-chat, only they are more vivid over all the upper side of the body; the brown of the back is of a lighter rufous, and the black dashes are there better desined. This pleasing variety prevails from
<PB N="217" REF="245"/>
the crown of the head to the coverts of the tail; the middle quills of the wings are edged with rufous, the great ones with white, but more lightly; they are all blackish. But if the colours be more distinct on the upper side of this bird than in the common stone-chat, they are, on the contrary, duller below, only the breast is slightly tinged with a fulvous red between the white of the throat and that of the belly.—This bird was brought from Senegal by Adanson. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Motacilla Fervida:</HI> "It is brown; the margin of its quills rufous; below, ochry-white; two white spots on the wings; the tail black."</NOTE></P>

The female might, from its colours, be taken for a bird of quite a different species; a dun rufous covers all the under side of her body and the rump; the same colour shews itself on the head through the the waves of a browner cast, which grow deeper on the wings and tail, and become of a very dull rusty brown.—The cock and hen were sent from the island of Luçon, where, Brisson says, they are called <HI>maria-capra.</HI> <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Motacilla-Caprata:</HI> "It is black; its rump, its vent, the spot on its wing coverts, white."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS stone-chat is larger than the preceding, being somewhat more than six inches in length; its head and throat are white, dashed with some spots of reddish and yellowish: a broad brick-coloured collar decorates the neck; and, below it, a scarf of a blueish black covers the breast, and extends to the back, forming a short cope, with two large white spots thrown on the shoulders; the rest of the upper side of the body is black, with violet reflexions to the end of the tail; this black is intercepted on the wing by
<PB N="220" REF="248"/>
two small white bars, the one on the outer edge near the shoulder, the other at the extremity of the great coverts; the belly and stomach are of the same reddish white with the head and throat; the bill, which is seven lines long, and the legs, which are thick and stout, are of a rust colour. Brisson says that the legs are black, and perhaps their colour varies: the wings reach to the end of the tail, which is different from what obtains in all other stone-chats, where the wings scarcely extend to the middle of the tail.</P>

<P>BRISSON has given a description of this bird, which we find to be very exact, on comparing it with a specimen sent to the King's cabinet. He tells us, that it is called <HI>fitert</HI> at Madagascar, and that its song is pleasant; this seems to shew, that it is different from our stone-chats,
<PB N="221" REF="249"/>
which have only a disagreeable chirp: they agree, however, in several prominent characters. It is rather larger than the European stone-chat, being five inches four lines in length; the throat, the head, and all the upper side of the body to the tail, are black, only the back and shoulders have some rusty waves; the fore part of the neck, the stomach, and the belly, are white; the breast is rufous; the white colour of the neck is set off by the black of the throat and the rufous of the breast, and forms a sort of collar; the great coverts of each wing which are next the body are white, which makes a white spot on the wing; a little white also ter∣minates the quills of the wing on their inside, and augments in proportion as they are nearer the body. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Motacilla-Sybilla:</HI> "It is blackish, below white, the breast rufous, a white spot on the wings."—Thus described by Brisson: "Above, black; the feathers fringed with rusty at their tips; the breast rufous; a bright spot on the wings; the quills of the tail black."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS stone-chat well deserves the epithet of <HI>great.</HI> It is seven inches and a quarter from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail; and six inches and an half from the point of the bill to the end of the nails; the bill is an inch long, and not scalloped; the tail is about two inches, and is a little forked; the wings, when closed, cover the half of it; the <HI>tarsus</HI> is eleven lines; the mid toe seven, the hind one seven, and its nail the strongest of them all. Commerson has left an account of this bird, but makes no mention of the coun∣try where he saw it; however, the description we give of it is sufficient to enable travellers to recognise it. The chief colour of its plum∣age is brown; the head is variegated with two brown tints; a light brown covers the upper side of the neck and body; the throat is mixed with brown and whitish: the breast is brown; and this is also the colour of the coverts of the wings, and of the outer edge of the quills,

<HEAD>VII. THE STONE-CHAT OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. Sylvia Sperata, <HI>Lath. Ind.</HI></HEAD>
<P>M. DE ROSENEUVETZ saw, at the Cape of Good Hope, a stone-chat which has never been described by naturalists. It is six inches long; the bill black, and seven lines in length, scal∣loped near the tip; the legs black; the <HI>tarsus</HI> an inch long: all the upper side of the body, in∣cluding the neck and head, of a very brown green; all the under side of the body, gray, with some tints of rufous; the rump is rufous; the quills and the coverts of the wings are brown, with a lighter border of the same colour; the tail is twenty-two lines in length, and the wings reach to its middle; it is somewhat forked: the two
<PB N="224" REF="252"/>
middle quills are of a blackish brown; the two side ones are marked obliquely with brown on a fulvous ground, and this is the more remark∣able in proportion as they are exterior. Ano∣ther specimen, of the same size, brought also from the Cape of Good Hope by M. de Rose∣neuvetz, and deposited in the Royal Cabinet, is perhaps only the female. The whole upper side of the body is merely of a blackish brown, the throat whitish, and the breast rufous. We are unacquainted with the habits of these birds; yet these are what alone form the interesting part of the history of animated beings. But how often have we been forced to regret, that we could only describe the appearance, and not delineate the character! All these incomplete facts ought however to be collected, and placed beside the immense range of observations; as the navigators insert in their charts the lands seen at distance.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. THE SPECTACLE WARBLER. Le Clignot, ou Traquet à Lunette, <HI>Buff.</HI> Motacilla Perspicilla, <HI>Gmel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A CIRCLE of yellowish skin folded quite round the eyes, and resembling spectacles, is a singular character which distinguishes this bird. Commerson found it on the river <HI>de la Plata,</HI> near Montevideo, and the appella∣tions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Perspicillarius, Nictitarius, Lichenops,</HI> Clignot.</NOTE> which he gives to it, allude to this uncom∣mon conformation of the exterior of the eyes. It is of the size of a goldfinch, but thicker in the body: its head is round, and the crown raised: its plumage is of a fine black, except the white spot on the wing, which makes it resemble the stone-chats; this spot spreads broad over the middle of the five first quills, and terminates in a point about the end of the sixth, seventh, and eighth. In some subjects, there is also white on the lower coverts of the tail; in others, they are black as the rest of the plumage: the wing reaches only to the middle of the tail, which
<PB N="226" REF="254"/>
is two inches long, square when it is closed, and forming almost an equilateral triangle when it is spread; it consists of eight equal quills: the bill is straight, slender, yellowish at the up∣per part, and slightly bent or hooked at the end: the tongue is membranous, like a dou∣ble-pointed arrow: the eyes are round; the iris yellow, and the pupil blueish. The sin∣gular membrane which encircles the eyes, is probably nothing but the skin of the eye-lid naked and more expanded than ordinary, and consequently broad enough to make several folds. Such at least is the idea which Com∣merson suggests by comparing it to the wrin∣kled lichen, and telling us that the two por∣tions of this membrane, which is fringed at the edges, meet when the bird shuts its eyes. We may also observe the <HI>membrana nictitans,</HI> which rises from the inner <HI>canthus.</HI> The legs and toes are slender and black; the hind toe is the thickest, and is as long as those before, though it has only one joint, and its nail is the strongest. Could this bird be bred separate from the rest of its kind, and exiled in the mid∣dle of the new continent? It is at least the only one in America that is known to be related to the chats; but the analogies which it bears to them are not so striking as the character which distinguishes it, and which nature has im∣pressed

<P>THIS bird is common in the country, and is continually among the clods in new∣tilled fields, and hence its name in French <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Motteux,</HI> from <HI>motte</HI> a clod.</NOTE>. It follows the furrow traced by the plough, and searches for worms on which it feeds. When it is scared away, it never mounts high, but
<PB N="229" REF="257"/>
skims along the surface with a short rapid flight, and in its retreat it shews the white of the hind part of its body, by which it is easily distinguished in the air from all other birds, and hence its vulgar appellation among fowlers, <HI>cul-blanc</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White Arse.</NOTE>. It is also pretty frequent in fallow grounds, where it flies from stone to stone, and seems to shun the hedges and bushes, on which it does not perch near so often as on clods.</P>
<P>It is larger than the whin-chat, and taller, on legs which are black and slender; the belly is white, and so are the upper and under coverts of the tail, and nearly the half of its quills, of which the tips are black; they spread when it flies, and expose the white for which it is re∣markable: the wing in the male is black, with some fringes of rusty white: the back is a fine ash gray or blueish gray, which extends to the white ground; a white spot rises at the corner of the bill, bends under the eye, and stretches beyond the ear; a white stripe bounds the face, and passes over the eyes. The female has neither this spot nor this stripe; its plumage is marked with a rusty gray wherever that of the male is ash gray; its wing is more brown than black, and broad fringed as far as below the
<PB N="230" REF="258"/>
belly; and on the whole it resembles as much, or more, the hen whin-chat than its proper male. The young resemble the parent birds exactly at the age of three weeks, the time at which they fly.</P>
<P>The bill of the wheat-ear is slender at the tip and broad at the base, which enables it to seize and swallow the insects, on which it runs, or rather darts, rapidly by a succession of short hops <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 352.</NOTE>. It is always on the ground; and if it be put up, it only removes from one clod to another, flies always exceedingly low, and never enters the woods, nor perches higher than the hedges or small bushes. When seated it wags its tail, and chirps with a dull sound <HI>titreû, titreû</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence perhaps its old French name <HI>vitrec,</HI> or <HI>titrée.</HI></NOTE>; and, as often as it flies, it seems to pronounce distinctly, with a stronger voice, the words <HI>far-far, far-far:</HI> it repeats these two cries with a degree of precipitancy.</P>
<P>It breeds under the tufts and clods in newly ploughed fields, and under stones in fallow grounds, near quarries, in old rabbit burrows <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, or in the naked stone walls which are used for fences in hilly countries. Its nest is constructed with care: it is composed of moss or tender grass, and lined with feathers
<PB N="231" REF="259"/>
or wool; it is distinguished by a sort of covert placed above it, and stuck to the stone or clod under which the whole is formed. It lays ge∣nerally five or six eggs, of a light blueish white, with a circle at the large end of a duller blue. A female, which was caught on the eggs, had lost all the feathers from the middle of the stomach, as usual in the case of vigilant sitters. The male is attentive to his mate, and during the time of incubation he brings ants and flies: he watches near the nest: and when he observes one passing, he runs or flies before, and endeavours to draw notice till the person has got to a sufficient distance, and then he returns by a circuit to the nest.</P>
<P>The young ones are seen as early as the mid∣dle of May: for these birds have returned to our provinces as early as the first fine days in March <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lottinger.</NOTE>. But frosts often surprise them after their arrival, and numbers perish; as happen∣ed in Lorraine in 1767 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id.</NOTE>. There are many of them in that province, especially in the mountainous part: they are equally common in Burgundy and Bugey; but they are hardly seen in Brie, except towards the end of the summer <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hebert.</NOTE>. In general they prefer high coun∣tries, upland plains, and arid tracts. Great
<PB N="232" REF="260"/>
numbers are caught by the English shepherds in the downs of Sussex about the beginning of autumn, at which time they are plump and of delicate flavour. Willughby describes the method of catching them: they cut up a long strip of turf, and invert it on the furrow, so as to leave only a narrow track, in which they place snares made of horse hair. The birds are incited by a double motive; to procure food in the new-turned earth, and to conceal themselves under the sod. The appearance of a hawk, or even the shadow of a cloud, will drive them for shelter into those traps <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant tells us, that in the district of <HI>Eastbourn</HI> in Sussex, one thousand eight hundred and forty dozens of wheat-ears are at an average caught annually, which are sold commonly for sixpence a dozen.

<P>They all return in August and September, and no more are seen after that month.

<PB N="233" REF="261"/>
among us they make little use of their power of flying, they probably exert it in their mi∣grations.

<P>The appellations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Motteux, Tourne-motte, Brise-motte, &amp; Ferrasson <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i. e.</HI> clodder, turn-clod, break-clod, and earth-thrower.</NOTE> which the wheat-ear re∣ceives in different parts of France, allude to its habits of living on the ground and in the holes; of sitting on the clods, and appearing to strike them with its tail. Its English names refer to its frequenting both fallow and tilled grounds, and to the whiteness of its rump. But the Greek term <HI>oenanthe,</HI> which naturalists have, from a conjecture of Belon, agreed to apply to it, seems not so characteristic or so proper as the preceding. The mere analogy of the word <HI>oenanthe</HI> to <HI>vitiflora,</HI> and the resem∣blance of this to the old French name <HI>vitrec,</HI> led Belon to form this opinion; for he does not explain why it was called <HI>vine-flower</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>). It also arrives before the blowing of the vine, and continues long after the blossom is dropped; and it has therefore no connexion with the flower of the vine. Aristotle describes it only
<PB N="234" REF="262"/>
as appearing and disappearing at the same time with the cuckoo <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 49. Pliny says the same of the disappearance of the <HI>oenanthe,</HI> lib. x. 29. From this pas∣sage, Father Hardouin infers that the <HI>oenanthe</HI> is not the wheat-ear, but a nocturnal bird.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Brisson reckons five species of wheat-ears:</P>
<P N="1">I. THE WHEAT-EAR.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE GRAY WHEAT-EAR, which he discriminates from the first only by that epi∣thet, though that is equally gray. Its difference, according to Linnaeus, who makes it a variety, is, that the plumage, which is of a pale colour in both, is marked with small whitish waves. Brisson adds another slight distinction in the breast feathers, which are, he says, sprinkled with little gray spots; and in those of the tail, of which the two middle ones have no white, though the rest are white three fourths of their length. But the minute details of the various tints of the plumage would easily transform the same individual into several species; we have only to describe it nearer or farther from the season of moulting <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Young wheat-ears, taken the 20th of May, had the upper part of their body mottled with rusty and brown: the feathers of the rump are whitish, striped lightly with black; the throat and the under side of the body rufous, dotted with black: all this livery is cast the first year.</NOTE>. To examine the
<PB N="235" REF="263"/>
productions of nature in this way is to lose sight of her design; it is to mistake the sport∣ive superficial touches of her pencil, for the deep permanent strokes with which she has engraved the characters of animals.</P>
<P N="3">III. The third species of Brisson is THE CINEREOUS WHEAT-EAR <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Above cinereous white, mixed with gray brown; be∣low white; the rump gray brown; the lower part of the neck light tawny; the forehead bright white; a black spot below the eyes: of the two middle quills of the tail their first half is white, and the other blackish; the lateral ones white, terminated with blackish; the three outermost on both sides fringed with whitish at the tips." <HI>Brisson.</HI></NOTE>; but the differences which he marks are too slight to discriminate them, especially since the epithet <HI>cinereous</HI> agrees as well with the common wheat-ear, of which this is only a variety. Thus the three pre∣tended species are reduced to one. But the fourth and fifth species of Brisson are more de∣cidedly distinguished, viz. <HI>The Rusty White-Tail,</HI> and <HI>The Rufous White-Tail.</HI></P>

It might be readily taken for the female of the common wheat-ear, if some individuals had not the character of the male, the black stripe on the cheek between the bill and the ear; so that this would seem to be a permanent variety. It is found in Lor∣raine near the mountains; but it is not so fre∣quent as the ordinary species.

higher part of the belly and the flanks are ful∣vous; the lower belly is dirty white, and the inferior coverts of the tail light fulvous; but the superior ones are white, and so are the quills as far as their middle: the rest is black, termi∣nated with dirty white, except the two middle ones, which are entirely black, and tipped with fulvous; the wings are of a brown cast, edged slightly with light fulvcus on the great quills, and more slightly on the middle quills and on the coverts.</P>

<HEAD>THE WAGTAILS.</HEAD>
<P>THE White Wagtail <HI>(Lavandiere)</HI> has of∣ten been confounded with the other kinds <HI>(Bergeronettes):</HI> but the former com∣monly haunts the sides of pools, and the others frequent the meadows, and follow the flocks. All of them flutter often in the fields round the husbandman, and attend the plough to pick up the worms that crawl in the fresh-turned soil. At other seasons, the flies which molest the cattle, and all the insects which swarm on the margin of stagnant water, are their food. The wagtails are real <HI>fly-catchers,</HI> if we regard only their manner of life: but they differ from these birds, because they do not watch their prey from trees, and hunt it: they only search on the ground. They form a small family of birds with a delicate bill, tall and slender legs, and a long tail, which they vibrate incessantly: and, from this habit, they have been termed <HI>Motacilla</HI> by the Ro∣mans, and received their various names in the provinces of France.</P>

<P><PB N="244" REF="273"/>
The white wagtail is scarcely larger than the ordinary titmouse, though its long tail seems to add to its size, so that its whole length is seven inches: the tail itself is three inches and an half, which the bird expands and displays while it flies. With this large oar it directs and balances its motions: it whirls, it darts, and sports in the air; and when it alights, it briskly wags it upwards and downwards, at intervals of five or six shakes.</P>
<P>These birds run nimbly with little hasty steps on the sandy brinks; they even venture with their long legs to the depth of a few lines in the thin sheet of water that spreads over the shelving margin: but they oftener flutter about mill∣dams, and sit on stones. They visit the washer-women, and hover about them the whole day, approaching familiarly, and picking up the crumbs that are thrown to them; and, by the jerking of their tail, seem to imitate the action of cleansing linen; from which habit they have been called in French <HI>lavandiere (washer)</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.—In England they are likewise called sometimes <HI>dish-washers.</HI> T.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plumage of the white wagtail consists of mottles and large spots of black and white: the belly is white: the tail consists of twelve quills, of which the ten middle ones are black,
<PB N="245" REF="274"/>
and the two side ones white to near their ori∣gin: the wing reaches only the third of their length; the quills of the wings are blackish and white gray. Belon observes that, with re∣gard to its wings, the wagtail has some relation to the aquatic birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It has a particular mark by which it resembles the shore birds: this is, that the last feathers of the wings, joining the body, are as long as the first of the anterior ones; which obtains likewise in all other birds that live on flies and earth worms, the plovers and the lapwings." Belon, <HI>Nat. des Oiseaux,</HI> p. 349.</NOTE>. The upper side of the head is covered with a black cap, which de∣scends to the nape of the neck; a white half∣mask conceals the face, surrounds the eye, and, falling on the sides of the neck, bounds the black of the throat, which is marked with a broad horse-shoe rounded on the breast. Many subjects have only a zone or semi-circle at the top of the breast, and their throat is white; and the back, which is of a slate gray in others, is of a brown gray in these, which seem to form a variety <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The lead colour varies in this kind of birds, some be∣ing more cinereous, others blacker." <HI>Willughby.</HI> Albin says the same, vol. i. p. 43. Some observers seem to attri∣bute this difference to that of age, and assert that most of the wagtails are white on their return in spring, and assume black in the course of the season. Belon seems to be of this opinion: "The young wagtails in their sixth month," says he, "are of another colour than those an year old, and which have cast their first plumage."</NOTE>, though they are mixed and con∣founded
<PB N="246" REF="275"/>

<P>The white wagtail returns into our provinces about the end of March. It breeds on the ground under some roots, or below a grass tuft in lands not in tillage: but oftenest by the edge of waters, beneath a hollow bank, or under the stakes of wood that are driven along the sides of rivers. Their nest consists of dry herbs and small roots, sometimes intermixed with moss; the whole loosely composed, and lined with feathers or hair. They commonly have four or five white eggs, sprinkled with brown spots; and only make a single hatch, un∣less the first fails. The parents defend their young courageously: they flutter and dive be∣fore their enemy to draw him aside; and if he carries off the nest, they follow him, flying above his head, and constantly whirling round, calling on their young with doleful cries. They are also attentive to the cleanliness of their fa∣mily, and throw out the excrements, or even
<PB N="247" REF="276"/>
remove them to a certain distance. They also disperse the bits of paper and straws which have been laid to mark their nest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I observed wagtails that built in a hole of a wall washed by the river: they were at pains to clean their nest, and carry the excrements more than thirty paces off. A piece of white paper happened to rest on the stake that propped the wall by the water edge: this seemed offensive to the wagtails; and I saw them, one after another, make fruitless efforts to remove it. It was too heavy, and I there∣fore took it away; but left in its place little strips of paper equally white. They would not suffer these to remain; but carried them to the same distance as the dung of their young, being deceived by the similarity of colour. I re∣peated this experiment several times.<HI>"—Note communicated by M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>. After the young are able to fly, the parents continue to feed and train them for three weeks or a month: they gorge greedily the insects and ants' eggs that are brought to them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"I put eggs of large ants in a place where the wagtails resorted: they took fifteen or sixteen each time, till their throat was filled, and then carried them to their young.<HI>"—Note of the same observer.</HI></NOTE>. These birds are always remarked to eat uncommonly quickly, without seeming to allow time for swallowing. They collect the worms on the ground; they pursue and catch the flies in the air, and these are often the objects of their whirling. Their slight is waving, and consists of jerks and springs. They assist their motion by vibrating
<PB N="248" REF="277"/>
their tail horizontally; a motion different from that on the ground, which is performed perpen∣dicularly. The wagtails utter frequently, espe∣cially while on the wing, a small, shrill, redou∣bled cry, and in a clear tone, <HI>guĩt-guit guiguiguit:</HI> it is the note of rallying, for those on the ground answer it. But the cry is louder, and oftener repeated, when they have just escaped the talons of the hawk <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. They are not so much afraid of men or other animals; for when they are fired at, they do not fly far, but return to alight at a short distance from the fowler. Some are caught along with the larks, by means of the net and mirror <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This sport lasts from four in the afternoon till the dusk of the evening: the persons place themselves by the mar∣gin of water, and attract the wagtails with a decoy bird of the same species; or, if that cannot be had, with some other small bird.</NOTE>; and it appears from Olina's account, that in Italy they are particularly fowled for about the mid∣dle of October.</P>
<P>Autumn is the time when they are most nu∣merous in the country <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">"In Brie, in Burgundy, in Bugey, and in most of our provinces, prodigious numbers are seen at certain times near inhabited places; in the fields, following the flocks: whence it appears that they are birds of passage.<HI>"—Note of M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>. That season, which
<PB N="249" REF="278"/>
collects them together, seems to inspire them with cheerfulness: they multiply their sports; they hover in the air, fall in the fields, pur∣sue and call upon each other. They come for∣ward in numbers on the roofs of mills, and in hamlets near water, and appear to hold dis∣course together by their little broken and re∣peated cries; we might fancy that they interro∣gate each other, and, for a certain time, reply in their turns, till the general acclamation of the assembly marks their resolution or consent to remove to some other spot. Now it is that they have the little soft warble with a low voice, which scarcely exceeds a murmur <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; and from this circumstance, probably, Belon has applied to them the Italian name <HI>susurada</HI> (from <HI>su∣surrus,</HI> a whisper). This gentle breathing is prompted by autumn, and by the pleasures of society, to which these birds seem much at∣tached.</P>
<P>About the end of autumn, the wagtails form into larger bodies. In the evening they descend among the willows and osiers, by sides of streams and rivers, where they call those which pass, and together make a noisy wrangling till dusk. In the clear mornings of October they fly sometimes very high, and vociferate inces∣santly
<PB N="250" REF="279"/>
to each other. Then is the time when they migrate into other climates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In the north of England it appears not in winter, and rarely even in the south." <HI>Willughby.</HI> "The white wagtails depart in autumn." <HI>Gesner.</HI></NOTE>. M. de Maillet says that, in this season, prodigious numbers of them drop in Egypt, and that the people dry them in the sand to preserve them for eating <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"From Cairo to the sea, all along the Nile, but chiefly near dwellings, are seen a great number of wagtails <HI>(bergeronettes</HI> ou <HI>lavandieres)</HI> of the blueish gray species, with a black half collar, shaped like a horse-shoe. I could not be informed whether these birds remained the whole year in Egypt.<HI>"—Note sent from Cairo by M. Soniini.</HI></NOTE>. M. Adanson mentions that they are seen in winter at Senegal, with the swallows and quails, but only during that season.</P>
<P>The white wagtail is common through the whole of Europe, as far as Sweden, and is found too, as we have just noticed, in Africa and in Asia. The one which M. Sonnerat brought to us from the Philippines is the same with that of Europe. That brought from the Cape of Good Hope by Commerson differed not from the va∣riety delineated <HI>Pl.

the whole of the severe season. At least, the most of them continue with us during the win∣ter: the yellow <HI>bergeronette</HI> is more uniformly sta∣tionary: the gray is less common in that season.</P>
<P>All the <HI>bergeronettes</HI> are smaller than the white wagtail, and their tail is proportionally longer. Belon was well acquainted only with the yellow one, and appears to indicate the gray <HI>bergero∣nette</HI> by the appellation of <HI>another kind of la∣vandiere.</HI></P>
<P>The upper side of the gray <HI>bergeronette</HI> is gray, or cinereous; the under side of its body white, with a brown bar, or half collar, on the neck: the tail is blackish, with white on the outer quills: the great quills of the wings are brown; the others blackish, and fringed with white, like the coverts.</P>
<P>They build about the end of April, com∣monly on a willow near the ground, and shel∣tered from rains. They breed twice a year. The second hatch is late; for their nests are found even in September; which could never happen to a family of birds that migrate, and are obliged to educate their young before the win∣ter. However, those of the first hatch, and the pairs which have more diligently discharged their office, spread through the fields in the months of July and August; whereas the white

wagtails seldom flock, except when they migrate about the end of September and in October <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>bergeronette,</HI> which is constitutionally the friend of man, will not become his slave, and it dies in the cage. It loves society, and cannot bear close confinement; but, if left loose in a room during winter, it will survive, and will catch flies, and pick up the crumbs of bread <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS <HI>bergeronette</HI> is the first that is seen in the meadows and fields, where it nestles among the green corn. Scarcely indeed does it disappear in the winter, unless during the most severe colds: it commonly haunts, like the yel∣low kind, the sides of brooks, and springs which never freeze. The epithets bestowed on these birds seem improper; for the following species has less yellow than the present. That colour is distinct only on the rump and belly; but, in the spring <HI>bergeronette,</HI> all the up∣per and fore parts of the body are of a fine yel∣low; and there is a streak of the same on the

wing, at the fringe of the middle coverts. All the mantle is of a dull olive, which also borders the eight quills of the tail, whose ground co∣lour is blackish: the two outer ones are more than half white: those of the wings are brown, with their outer edge whitish; and the third of those nearest the body reaches, when the wing is closed, as far as the longest of the great quills; a character which we have already noticed in the white wagtail. The head is cinereous; the crown tinged with olive: above the eye there is a line, which is white in the female, and yellow in the male; which is distinguished also by blackish streaks, more or less frequent, form∣ing a crescent under the throat, and also sprin∣kled above the knees. When the male is in season, he runs and turns round his female, bristling up the feathers on his back in an odd sort of way, but which undoubtedly expresses the fire of his passion.

<P>WHEN the white wagtails depart in au∣tumn, the <HI>bergeronettes</HI> come near our dwellings, says Gesner, and appear even in the midst of the villages. This habit belongs espe∣cially to the yellow kind <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gesner, Aldrovandus, Olina.</NOTE>: it then procures its subsistence beside the margins of perennial springs, and shelters itself beneath the shelving banks of rivulets. It finds its situation so com∣fortable, that it even warbles in that torpid season, unless the cold be excessive. This is a soft whispered song, like the autumnal notes of the white wagtail, and very different from the shrill cry which it utters in rising into the air.
<PB N="260" REF="289"/>
In the spring, it removes to breed in the mea∣dows, or sometimes in the copses beneath a root, and near running water: the nest is placed on the ground, and built with dry herbs and moss, well lined with feathers, hair, or wool, and closer interwoven than that of the white wagtail. It contains six, seven, or eight eggs, of a dirty white, spotted with yellowish. After the young are raised, and the meadows are mowed, the parents lead them among the herds of cattle.</P>
<P>Flies and gnats are then their food; for, when they haunt the sides of streams in winter, they subsist on worms, and also swallow little seeds. We found these, with fragments of caterpillars, and a small stone, in the gizzard of a yellow <HI>bergeronette,</HI> caught in the end of December. The <HI>aesophagus</HI> was dilated before its insertion: the gizzard was muscular, and lined with a dry wrinkled membrane, which had no adhesion: the intestinal tube was ten inches long, and without any <HI>caecum,</HI> or gall bladder: the tongue was fringed at the end, as in all the <HI>bergero∣nettes:</HI> the hind nail was the longest.</P>
<P>Of all the long tailed birds, the yellow <HI>berge∣ronette</HI> is most remarkable for that character <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>: its tail is near four inches, and its body is

only three and an half: its alar extent is eight inches ten lines: its head is gray; its mantle, as far as the rump, deep olive, on a gray ground; its rump yellow; the under side of its tail of a brighter yellow; its belly and breast of a pale yellow in young subjects, such as those which Brisson seems to have described; but in adults they are of a rich brilliant yellow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.—"There is a distinction in the bergerette between the male and the female; the male being very yellow under the belly, no bird more so." <HI>Belon.</HI></NOTE>: the throat is white: a small longitudinal whitish bar rises at the bill, and passes over the eye: the plumage of the wings is of a brown gray, slightly fringed in some places with a white gray: there is some white at the origin of the middle quills, which forms a transverse bar on the wing, when this is spread; also, the exte∣rior edge of the three nearest the body is pale yellow, and of these three the first is almost as long as the largest quill: the outermost of those of the tail is entirely white, except a black hol∣low on the inside: the next is white only within, and the third the same: the six others are blackish.

According to Belon, their yellow tint is also much more vivid: the line of the eyebrows is equally yellow: and it is remarked that the colour of all these birds is more intense in winter after moulting.</P>
<P>Edwards describes this bird under the name of <HI>the gray water wagtail</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gleanings.</HI> An inaccurate denomination which origi∣nated with Willughby, who owns that he described only the female.</NOTE>; and Gesner applies the epithets of <HI>shake-tail, beat-ley,</HI> which are equivalent to <HI>lavandiere (washer-woman).</HI> In fact, these <HI>bergeronettes</HI> frequent, no less often than the white wagtail, the brinks of water and pebbly brooks <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>; and, since they lodge in such situations during the winter, their haunts are even more constant.

<P>THE foreign bergeronettes resemble so closely those of Europe, that we might readily suppose them to be derived from the same stock, and only modified by the influence of climate. The one from the Cape of Good Hope was brought by Sonnerat, and is the same which Brisson describes. A great brown man∣tle, which terminates in black on the tail, and its two edges, joined below the tail by a brown scarf, covers all the upper side of the body, which is as large as that of the white wagtail. All the

<HEAD>THE FIG-EATERS. LES FIGUIERS, <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE birds are of a genus approaching to that of the fig-peckers, and resemble these in their principal characters. Their bill is straight, slender, and very acute, with two small scallops near the extremity of the upper man∣dible; a property which they have in common with the tanagres, in which however the bill is much thicker and shorter. The nostrils of the fig-eaters are uncovered, which distinguishes them from the titmice: the angle of their hind nail is arched, which separates them from the larks; and therefore they must be ranged by themselves.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with five species of fig-eaters in the hot countries of the old continent, and twenty-nine in those of America: these differ from the former in the shape of the tail, which is regularly tapered in the species that inhabit the old continent, but notched at the end in the natives of America, and almost fork∣ed, the two middle quills being shorter than the
<PB N="270" REF="300"/>
others; and that character is sufficient to de∣cide to what continent they belong. We shall begin with those of the old.</P>

<P>THIS bird is called the <HI>Little Simon</HI> in the island of Bourbon, though it is not a na∣tive of that place, and must have been trans∣ported thither; for we are informed by people of veracity, and particularly by Commerson, that there existed no kind of quadrupeds or birds in the islands of Bourbon and France, when the Portuguese first discovered them. These islands appear to be the points of a continent which has been swallowed up, and almost their whole surface is covered with volcanic pro∣ductions; so that at present they are stocked only with animals that have been carried to them.</P>
<P>This bird is exactly of the same size with the preceding: the upper side of its body is of a light slate colour; the under side white gray; the throat white; the great quills of the tail
<PB N="274" REF="304"/>
deep brown, edged on one side with a slate co∣lour: the bill is brown, acute, and slender; the legs gray, and the eyes black: the females, and even the young ones, have nearly the same plumage as the males. They are very nume∣rous in every part of the island of Bourbon, where the Viscount Querhoënt observed them. They usually breed in September, and lay three or four eggs, probably several times in the course of the year. They build on single trees, and even in orchards: the nest is formed of dry herbs, and lined with hair: the eggs are blue. These birds will allow a person to get very near them; they fly always in flocks, and feed on insects and small soft fruits. When they see a partridge running along the ground, a hare, or a cat, &amp;c. they flutter round it, making a peculiar cry; and hence they direct the fowler to his prey. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Sylvia Borbanica,</HI> Lath.: "It is brown gray; below yellowish gray; the quills of the wings and of the tail edged with gray."</NOTE></P>

<P>WE shall now proceed to enumerate the spe∣cies of fig-eaters that are found in America. They are in general larger than those of the ancient continent. We have already noticed their distinguishing character, and we can only subjoin some details with regard to their habits. They are of a wandering disposition; they pass the summer in Carolina, or even so far north as Canada, and return to the warmer regions to breed and raise their young. They inhabit the cleared grounds and the cultivated spots: they perch on small shrubs, and feed on insects and ripe tender fruits, such as those of the bananas, of the mangroves, and of the fig-trees, which are not natives of that climate, but were trans∣ported thither; they enter the gardens to peck them, and hence their name: however, they on the whole eat more insects than fruits; for, if these are hard, they cannot break them.</P>

<P>EDWARDS calls this bird the <HI>Pine-creeper;</HI> but it does not belong to that genus, though it creeps on the pines in Carolina and Penn∣sylvania. The bill of the creepers, it is well known, is bent like a sickle; whereas it is straight in this bird, which resembles the fig-eaters so much in every other respect, that it ought to be classed with them. Catesby is also mistaken in ranging it with the titmice, pro∣bably because, like these, it creeps on trees. Brisson has committed an oversight in separat∣ing the <HI>Pine-creeper</HI> of Catesby from that of Edwards.</P>
<P>The head, the throat, and all the under side of the body, are of a very beautiful yellow: there is a small black bar on each side of the

<P>The female is entirely brown.</P>
<P>This bird appears in Carolina in winter, where Catesby tells us that it searches on the deciduous trees for insects. It is also seen dur∣ing summer in the northern provinces.

<HEAD>THE MIDDLE-BILLS. Les Demi-Fins, <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN we compare the birds which inha∣bit the two continents, we perceive that those with strong bills, and which feed upon grain, are the most numerous in the old; but, on the contrary, those which have slender bills, and subsist upon insects, predominate in the new. This circumstance strikingly evinces the extensive influence which human industry has upon the productions of nature: for it is ob∣viously the cultivation of the various sorts of corn, subservient to the support of man, that has multiplied the granivorous birds. In the vast deserts of America, in her magnificent fo∣rests, and her immense savannas, where rude unassisted nature yields nothing similar to our corn, and affords only fruits and small seeds, with enormous quantities of insects, there the number of the species of birds which feed on these, and have slender bills, is proportionally great: but an insensible gradation connects the various productions of the universe, and bids defiance to the shackles of system.
<PB N="326" REF="358"/>
Between the birds with strong bills and those with slender ones there is an intermediate class, which, though it has never been admitted by nomenclators <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this article was sent to the press, I found that Edwards, in his Catalogue of Birds, &amp;c. at the end of his seventh volume, has reckoned, among those with bills of middle thickness, the following birds:

<ITEM>6. His Olive Flycatcher.</ITEM>

It comprehends those birds in the New World which have stronger bills than the <HI>pipits,</HI> but not so strong as the tanagres; and also those birds of the old continent which have stronger bills than the <HI>fauvettes,</HI> but not so strong as the larks. We might refer to it not only the ca∣landre and other larks, but many species which have been ranged in other classes, because this was not yet formed. Lastly, the titmice will occupy the place between the middle-bills and those which have slender bills: for though they appear delicate, yet, if we compare their thickness with their shortness, and consider that they can break a nut, and pierce the head of much larger birds, we shall be convinced that they have considerable strength.</P>

<P>THIS bird is entirely different from ano∣ther worm-eater mentioned by Sloane: it is discriminated by its climate, and by its na∣tural qualities. The bill is pretty sharp, brown above, and flesh-coloured below: its head is orange, and on each side there are two black bars, of which the one passes across the eye, and the other below it; and they are separated by a yellowish bar, beyond which they join near the back of the head: the throat and the breast are also of an orange colour, but which grows more dilute, as it diverges from the anterior parts, and is only whitish on the inferior coverts of the tail: the upper side of the neck, the back, the wings, and the tail, are of a deep olive green: the inferior coverts of the wings are of a yellowish white: the legs are flesh-co∣loured.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Pennsylvania, where it
<PB N="328" REF="360"/>
is migratory, as are all those with slender bills, and some of those which have strong bills. It arrives in the month of July, and advances to∣wards the north; but it is not seen, in that province, to return again in autumn; and the same is the case with all the others which pass in the spring. Edwards supposes that their route to the south lies beyond the Apalachian mountains; and undoubtedly they must be in∣duced to change their track, by the greater abundance of insects and worms which the back countries then afford.</P>

<P>Except the bill, which is brown, and the legs, which are also brown, but more dilute, this bird has only black and blue on its plumage: the black is spread on the throat, the bottom of the wing, and the fore part of the back, where it forms a semi-circle, whose convexity is turned towards the tail: besides this, there is a black streak which joins each nostril to the eye on the same side: the quills of the wings are

<P>I OWE the information which I have ob∣tained in regard to this bird to the Cheva∣lier Le Fevre Deshayes, who sent me a drawing of it. It is called <HI>bimbelè</HI> by the negroes, from its resemblance to an African bird of that name. But probably this appellation is not better ap∣plied than that of bastard linnet; for the bird resembles the linnet neither in its song, in its plumage, nor the shape of its bill.</P>
<P>Its song is not varied or rich: it turns on four or five notes. However, it is pleasant: for the tones are full, soft, and mellow.</P>
<P>It lives on fruits and small seeds. It prefers the haunt of the palms, and builds its nest in a
<PB N="334" REF="366"/>
sort of roost, which the palm birds and others form on those trees, at the place where the foot∣stalk supporting the cluster is inserted. It lays only two or three eggs, and this is perhaps one of the reasons the <HI>bimbelès</HI> are so rare.</P>
<P>Its plumage is still inferior to its song: the throat, the fore part of the neck, the breast, and the top of the belly, are dirty white, tinged with yellow: the legs, the lower belly, and the inferior coverts of the tail, are of a faint yel∣low; the flanks deep gray: all the upper part brown, deeper on the head, and lighter on the back: the rump and the superior coverts of the tail are olive green: the quills, and the supe∣rior coverts of the wings, and the quills of the tail, brown, edged exteriorly with a lighter co∣lour: the two outer pairs of the tail quills edged interiorly with a broad bar of pure white near their extremity: the lower face of all these quills is of a slate gray: the iris is light brown.</P>

<P>WE have already noticed a Jamaica bird among the finches, and termed it <HI>bo∣nana,</HI> but which must be discriminated from this. The present is much smaller, its plumage is different, and, though it haunts the same tree, its habits are probably distinct. We might de∣cide this matter, if the bird mentioned by Sloane were as well known as that which we are to describe from a coloured drawing, and an ac∣count of it sent by the Chevalier Deshayes. It is found in Saint Domingo, and the negroes affirm that it suspends its nest: it is often seen on the bananas; but other birds also feed on the fruit of these trees, and therefore the name is not appropriated to it.</P>
<P>The banana warbler has a bill somewhat curved, very acute, and of a middle size. Be∣sides bananas, it feeds on oranges, citronelles, avigato pears, and papaws. We cannot decide whether it also eats seeds or insects; but cer∣tainly
<PB N="337" REF="369"/>
there were no traces of these in the sto∣mach of the one dissected. It lodges in the ba∣nana plantations, in the grounds uncultivated and covered with bushes. It flies by starts and jerks, and its motion is rapid, and attended with a little noise. Its warble is scarcely varied: it is a series of cadences that rest more or less on the same tone.</P>
<P>But though the Bonana flies swiftly, Deshayes regards it as too weak and delicate to perform distant journeys, and to support the cold of the northern climates; he therefore concludes it to be a native of the new continent.</P>
<P>The upper side of the body is of a deep gray, almost blackish, which approaches to brown on the tail, and the coverts of the wings: the quills of the tail are not so deep coloured as those of the wings, and are tipped with white: it has a sort of white eyebrows: the eyes are placed in a black bar, which rises from the bill, and melts into the dark colour of the back of the head: the throat is ash gray: the breast, the belly, and the rump, are of a delicate yellow: the flanks, the thighs, and the inferior coverts of the tail, are variegated with light yellow and gray: some of the inferior coverts are white, and rise on the tail: the anterior part of the shoulders is of a fine yellow: the bill is black; the legs slate gray.</P>

Its crest consists of white feathers, which are long, narrow, and pointed: in the placid state they are reclined on the head, but when the bird is agitated by passion they become erect: the throat is white, edged with a black belt, which stretches from the one eye to the other: the back of the head, the fore part of the neck, the breast, the belly, the rump, the quills of the tail, their coverts both superior and inferior, and the infe∣rior coverts of the wings, are orange, which is more or less bright: the top of the back, the lower part of the neck joining the quills of the wings, their superior coverts, and the thighs, are of a deep cinereous, verging more or less on

<P>Total length, five inches and a quarter; the bill eight or nine lines; the <HI>tarsus</HI> ten lines; the outer toe connected almost its whole length to the mid toe; the tail composed of twelve quills, and projects eight or nine lines beyond the wings. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Pipra Albifrons:</HI> "It has a white crest, its body brick coloured, its back black."</NOTE></P>

<P>EDWARDS regrets in some measure that the plumage of this bird is too simple and uniform, and that it has no peculiarity to cha∣racterise it. I shall adopt this very simplicity as the character. A sort of cinereous cowl, with a slight tinge of green, covers the head and neck: all the upper side of the body, including the wings and the tail, is of a rusty brown: the quills are ash coloured beneath; the bill black, and the legs brown.</P>
<P>This bird is of the size of the hedge-spar∣row, but it is not of the same species, though Edwards has applied the same name; he ex∣pressly says that its bill is thicker and stronger.

<HEAD>THE PITPITS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH these birds bear great resem∣blance to the fig-eaters, and also inhabit the new continent, the difference is still so consider∣able, that they ought to be regarded as forming a distinct and separate genus. Most of the fig-eaters are migratory: all the pitpits continue settled in the hottest parts of America. They remain in the woods, and perch on the large trees; whereas the fig-eaters haunt only the cleared grounds, and lodge among the bushes, and on the middle-sized trees. The pitpits are also more social than the fig-eaters: they keep in large flocks, and mix familiarly with the small birds of other species: they are more joy∣ous and lively, and are continually hopping. But besides the difference of their habits, they are also discriminated by their conformation: their bill is thicker, and not so slender as that of the fig-eaters; and for this reason we have placed the middle-bills between them and the fig-eaters. The tail of the pitpits is also square-terminated, while, in the fig-eaters, it is somewhat forked. These two characters, drawn
<PB N="343" REF="375"/>
from the bill and the tail, are a sufficient founda∣tion for forming two genera of these birds.</P>
<P>We know only five species of the pitpits, and they are all found in Guiana and Brazil, and are nearly of the same size.</P>

<P>THE pitpits are in general nearly as large as the fig-eaters, but rather thicker: they are four and a half or five inches long. In the kind which we call the <HI>green pitpit</HI> the head and the small superior coverts of the wings only are of a sine blue, and the throat of a blueish gray; but all the rest of the body and the great supe∣rior coverts of the wings are of a brilliant green: the quills of the wings are brown, edged exte∣riorly with green: those of the tail are of a duller green: the bill is brown, and the legs gray.

<P>THIS is as frequent at Cayenne as the pre∣ceding: it is nearly of the same size, but it forms a separate species, which even includes varieties.

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the BLUE PITPIT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The bird called by Edwards the <HI>blue mana∣kin:</HI> for the only difference it has from the blue pitpit is, that the throat is black, and the face, as well as the sides of the head, blue, like the rest of the body.</P>

2. The bird figured in the <HI>Planches Enlumi∣nées,</HI> No. 669, fig. 1, and denominated the <HI>Blue Pitpit of Cayenne;</HI> the only difference be∣ing, that it has no black on the face, or on the sides of the head.</P>
<P>We must observe that Brisson regards the Mexican bird given by Fernandez under the name of <HI>elotototl,</HI> as a blue pitpit: but we can∣not discover any foundation for this opinion; since Fernandez is the only one who has seen that bird, and all that he says is, "that the <HI>elotototl</HI> is hardly so large as a goldfinch; that it is white or blueish, and its tail black; that it inhabits the mountains of Tetzocano; that its flesh is palatable; that it has no song; and, for that reason, is not bred in houses." From this account, it is impossible to conclude that this Mexican bird is a blue pitpit more than any other species.</P>

<P>THIS bird, which Marcgrave has describ∣ed, appears to me to belong to the pitpits; though his acount is not sufficiently complete to preclude its being ranged with the fig-eaters. It is as large as the goldfinch, which exceeds the ordinary size of the fig-eaters, and even of the pitpits. The upper side of its head, its neck, its back, its wings, and its tail, are of a light green: its throat is black: the rest of the under side of the body and the rump is of a gold yellow: some quills of the wings are brown at their ends: the bill is straight, sharp, and yellow, with a little black on the upper mandi∣ble: the legs are brown.</P>
<P>We will observe that Brisson has confounded this bird with that which Piso has given un∣der the name of <HI>guira-perea,</HI> though they are

<P>THE three smallest of our European birds are the gold-crested wren, the common wren, and the yellow wren. The latter, though not larger than the rest, is rather longer: it has the shape, the size, and figure of a little fig-eater; for the yellow wren might be ranged in that genus, which is already so numerous, were it not much better to give each species its proper name, which is well known, than to confound it among generic appellations. It might be
<PB N="351" REF="383"/>
termed the <HI>little European fig-eater,</HI> and I won∣der that some nomenclator has not thought of this classification. Its French name <HI>pouillot</HI> is evidently derived from the Latin <HI>pullus</HI> or <HI>pusil∣lus,</HI> signifying small and feeble.</P>
<P>The yellow wren feeds on flies and other lit∣tle insects: its bill is slender and tapered, the outside of a shining brown, the inside and the edges yellow <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>: the plumage consists of two faint tints of greenish gray and yellowish white: the first spreads on the back and the head: a yellowish line, rising from the corner of the bill, passes near the eye, and extends to the temple: the quills of the wings are of a dull gray, and, like those of the tail, have their outer edge fringed with greenish yellow: the throat is yellowish, and there is a spot of the same colour on each side of the breast, where the wing rests: the belly and the stomach are white, which is more or less dashed with a weak yellow, according to the age of the bird, or its difference of sex <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>: in general, the plumage of the yellow wren resembles that of the gold-crested wren, which has only an additional white spot on the wing, and a yellow crest <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus and Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The yellow wren resides in the woods during
<PB N="352" REF="384"/>
summer: it builds its nest in the heart of the bushes, or in a tuft of thick herbage: the construction is as artful as it is concealed: the outside consists of moss, and the inside is lined with hair or wool: the whole is closely inter∣woven and covered, and is shaped like a ball, as that of the gold-crested wren, the common wren, and the long-tailed titmouse. It would seem that the voice of nature has directed these four very small birds to the structure of this nest; since their heat, if not guarded and con∣centrated, would be insufficient for incubation. And this is an additional proof that in all ani∣mals the faculty of propagating their species per∣haps surpasses the instinct for self-preservation. The female of the yellow wren lays commonly four or five eggs, and sometimes six or seven, of a dirty white, dotted with reddish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Ray.—"This little bird is much at∣tached to its nest, which it will hardly forsake. A friend of mind told me that, one day having found a nest of this bird, he made it lay thirty eggs one after another, by remov∣ing one every day: after which he took pity on the tender dam, and suffered her to hatch." <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>. The young ones remain in the nest until they can fly with ease.</P>
<P>In autumn, the yellow wren leaves the woods, and sings in our gardens and vineyards: it seems to repeat the sounds <HI>tuit, tuit,</HI> which is
<PB N="353" REF="385"/>
the name it receives in some provinces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Tuscany, <HI>Lui;</HI> it pronounces this name with a plaintive voice, says Olina, without having any other song.

I have heard it sing more than three weeks before the wild nightingale." <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>, which lasts during the whole spring and summer. The song has three or four vari∣ations, which are mostly modulated: it begins with a slender broken cluck, which is succeeded by a series of silvery detached sounds, like the clinking of telling crown pieces: this is pro∣bably what Willughby and Albin compare to the stridulous voice of grashoppers. After these two notes, very different from each other, the bird sings its full song: it is soft, pleasant, and well supported: it lasts during all the spring and summer; but in the month of August it gives place to a slender whistle, <HI>tuit, tuit,</HI> which
<PB N="354" REF="386"/>
is nearly the same in the red-tail and in the nightingale <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is probably what Willughby terms a querulous∣voice. <HI>Ornithol.</HI> p. 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The yellow wren is extremely active: it in∣cessantly flutters briskly from one branch to ano∣ther: it darts from its place to catch a fly: it returns and searches continually among the leaves, on both sides, for insects, which in some provinces has given occasion to the name of <HI>frisker (fretillet, fenerotet):</HI> it has a small of∣cillation of the tail upwards and downwards, but slow and regular.</P>
<P>These birds arrive in April, often before the leaves are unfolded. They form flocks of fif∣teen or twenty during their passage; but they immediately separate into pairs. Sometimes, shortly after their appearance, they are surprised by frosts, and drop dead in the roads <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"This little bird is so feeble, that if we cast a cold at the branch on which it sits, it will be stunned by the shake, and tumble off." <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This delicate little species is however widely diffused. It even visits Sweden, where Lin∣naeus says it inhabits the willow plots <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> No. 236.</NOTE>. It is known in all the provinces of France: in Bur∣gundy it is called <HI>fenerotet:</HI> in Champagne,

"Two circumstances induce us to think that this is the <HI>asilus:</HI> the first, that it would be so called in Greece on account of its smallness; the second, that, as the gad-fly makes a continual noise with its wings, so this bird sings almost incessantly."

Mr. White asserts that there are three species of the willow wren, which differ in their size, and in their note. The yellowest bird is considerably the largest, and is distinguished by having its quills tipped with white. It haunts the tops of trees, and makes a sibilous noise like a grashopper; at intervals it rises singing and shivering its wings. But it were rash to multiply species. This bird is much subject to variety in point of size and plumage; and its note must evidently depend on the season of the year.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>THE GREAT YELLOW WREN.</HEAD>
<P>WE are acquainted with another yellow wren, which is not so small by a fourth part as the preceding, and differs too by its co∣lours: its throat is white, and there is a whitish streak across the eye: a rusty tint, on a whitish ground, covers the breast and belly: the same tint forms a broad fringe on the coverts and quills of the wings, of which the ground is blackish: a mixture of these two colours ap∣pears on the back and the head: in other re∣spects, this bird has the same shape with the common yellow wren. It is found in Lor∣raine, whence it was sent to us: but as we are ignorant of its natural habits, we cannot decide with regard to the identity of these two species.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>great yellow wren,</HI> which Brisson reckons, after Willughby, as a variety of the common kind, and which <HI>has double the size,</HI> it is difficult, if the matter is not exaggerated, to conceive that a bird of twice the bulk should be∣long to the same species.

The <HI>troglodytes,</HI> then, is that very small bird which appears in the villages and near towns on the approach of winter, and even in the coldest weather, having a clear sprightly little war∣ble, particularly towards evening: it pops out on the top of piles of wood or bundles of fag∣gots, and next moment glides into cover; or if it ventures out on the eaves of a house, it quickly hides itself under the roof, or in a hole of the wall; when it hops among the heaped branches: its little tail is always cocked. Its flight is short and whirling, and its wings beat so briskly, that their vibrations are not percep∣tible. Hence the Greeks called it <HI>trochilus,</HI> which is probably the diminutive of <HI>trochus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Trochilus</HI> is derived from <HI>trochus,</HI> because of its top∣like shape." <HI>Klein.</HI></NOTE>, a top; and this appellation not only refers to its mode of flying, but corresponds to its round compact form.</P>
<P>The wren is only three inches nine lines long, and its alar extent five inches and an half; its bill six lines, and its legs eight: all its plu∣mage
<PB N="360" REF="393"/>
is intersected transversely with little wavy zones of deep brown and blackish on the body and the wings, and even on the head and the tail: the under side of its body is mixed with whitish and gray: it is the plumage of the woodcock in miniature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have seen children who knew the woodcock call the wren, the first time it was shewn them, a <HI>young woodcock.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>This very small bird is almost the only one that continues in our climate till the depth of winter; and it alone retains its cheerfulness in that dreary season: it is always brisk and joy∣ous; and, as Belon says, it is constantly gay and stirring <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The expression used is <HI>allègre &amp; vioge,</HI> which, Buffon remarks, has lost its energy in the French language.</P>
<P>When it sings, it gives its tail a brisk little motion from right to left.

It thus lives in the out courts and in the wood yards, searching among the faggots, on the bark, under the roofs, in the holes of walls, and even in pits, for chrysalids and dead insects. It frequents too the margins of perennial springs and brooks that never freeze, and shelters itself in the hollow willows. In such lodgments the wrens sometimes gather in numbers <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A sportsman told me that he has often found more than twenty collected in the same hole.</NOTE>: they often come out to drink, and return quickly to their common receptacle. Though familiar, and not disconcerted by near approach, they are difficult to catch: their smallness, and their nimbleness, enable them almost always to elude the eye and the talons of their enemies.</P>
<P>In the spring, the wren lives in the woods, where it builds its nest near the ground, among branches, or even on the truf; sometimes be∣neath the trunk of a tree, on a rock, or even under the shelving brink of a rivulet; some∣times in the thatched roof of some lone cot∣tage in a wild retreat, and even on the hut of
<PB N="362" REF="395"/>
the charcoal-maker and wooden-shoe maker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In French, <HI>Charbonniers</HI> and <HI>Sabotiers.</HI></NOTE>, who are employed in the forests. For the con∣struction the bird collects much moss, and of that material the outside is entirely composed; but within it is neatly lined with seathers. The nest is almost round, and externally it is so bulky and mishapen as to escape the robber's search; for it seems only a heap of moss rolled together by chance: there is only one little narrow aperture made in the side. The bird lays nine or ten dirty white eggs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld and Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, with a zone dotted with reddish at the obtuse end. It will forsake, if it perceives that they are discovered. The young ones leave their lodgment before they are able to fly, and they run like little mice among the bushes <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gesner.</NOTE>. Sometimes the field-mice possess themselves of the nest; whether that the wren has forsaken it, or that these intruders drive away the bird, by destroying the hatch <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">"I sound this spring in a thorn hedge, about five feet from the ground, a nest snaped like the wren's, built of moss and wool. I was much surprised, upon tearing it, to observe in it five young field mice.

We have not discovered that, in our climate, it breeds a second time during the month of Au∣gust,
<PB N="363" REF="396"/>
as Albertus says in Aldrovandus, and as Olina avers to be the case in Italy, adding that numbers are seen in Rome, and in its vicinity. The same author gives directions how to raise them, after they are taken from the nest; but, as Belon observes, it will be difficult to succeed, for the wren is too delicate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"To raise it, we must keep it warm in the nest; give it often to eat, but little at a time, sheep's or calf's heart minced very small, and some slies. When it feeds alone, a little corner of the cage should be hemmed in with red cloth, to which the bird may retire at night."</NOTE>. We have re∣marked that it is fond of the company of the red-breasts; at least it attends the call with these birds: it approaches making a short cry <HI>tirit, tirit,</HI> which is of a deeper tone than its song, but equally like the sound of a clock-bell. It is so fearless and prying, that it even enters the window of the piper's lodge. It flutters and chants in the woods till dark, and, with the red-breast and blackbird, it is heard among the latest after sunset <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Turner.</NOTE>: it is likewise one of the earliest awake. It is not prompted, however, by the pleasures of society; for it prefers retirement in the love season, and the males pursue each other hotly <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The species is extensively spread through
<PB N="364" REF="397"/>
Europe. Belon says that it is common every where: however, if it endures our winters, it can hardly support the rigours of the North. Linnaeus tells us that it is rare in Sweden. The names which it has in different countries suffice to distinguish it: Frisch calls it <HI>king of winter hedges:</HI> Schwenckfeld, <HI>snow-king (Schnee∣koenig):</HI> in some provinces of France it is termed <HI>chill-king (roi de froidure):</HI> one of the German names <HI>(Zaun-Schlupfer)</HI> alludes to its gliding into the hedges: and the old En∣glish expression, <HI>dike smouler,</HI> mentioned by Gesner, has the same import. The Sicilian ap∣pellation, <HI>Perchia-chagia,</HI> signifies <HI>bush-borer.</HI> In Orleanois it is called <HI>ratereau,</HI> or <HI>ratillon,</HI> be∣cause it runs among the coverts like a young field-mouse: lastly, in some provinces it is called <HI>ox (boeuf),</HI> by way of antiphrasis, on account of its extreme smallness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hebert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird seems to have two representatives in the new continent: <HI>the Wren of Buenos-Ayres</HI> and <HI>Wren of Louisiana.</HI> The first is of the same size and plumage, only its colours are rather more vivid and distinct; and it may be regarded as a variety of the European kind. Commerson, who saw it at Buenos Ayres, men∣tions nothing of its habits, except that it is
<PB N="365" REF="398"/>
found on both banks of the river de la Plata, and that it even enters the vessels in pursuit of flies. The second is one third larger than the first: its breast and belly are of a yellowish fulvous: there is a small white ray behind the eye: the rest of the plumage on the head, the back, the wings, and the tail, is of the same colour, and marbled, as in the common wren. Father Charlevoix commends the song of the Canadian wren, which is probably the same with that of Louisiana. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><P>Specific character of the Common Wren, <HI>Mota∣cilla-Troglodytes:</HI> "It is gray: its wings waved with black and cinereous."

The Wrens continue in Britain the whole year. They are rare in Sweden and Russia, and never pe∣netrate to Siberia.</P>
<P>The North American Wren, mentioned by Charlevoix, appears in the state of New York about May, and breeds in June. It builds in holes of trees; its materials fibres and sticks, which it lines with hairs and feathers. It lays from seven to nine white eggs, with straggling spots of red. It retires southwards in August. It is twice as large as the ordinary wren, and its note is different.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS is the smallest of all the European birds. It passes through the meshes of common nets; cages cannot confine it; and, if let loose in a chamber, the least crack will allow it to escape. When it visits our gardens, and glides among the hedge-rows, how quickly
<PB N="367" REF="400"/>
does it vanish from our sight! The smallest leaf is sufficient to conceal it. If we want to shoot it, we must use very fine sand; for the smallest lead shot would spoil the plumage. When we have succeeded in catching it, either with lime∣twigs, with the titmouse trap, or with a very close net, we must be careful not to crush the delicate bird; and, as it is exceedingly nimble, we are not yet sure of securing it.

Aristotle says that it sings agreeably; but probably those who communicated that fact had confounded it with the common wren, especially as the phi∣losopher himself acknowledges that the same name was sometimes applied to both birds. The female lays six or seven eggs, whch are scarcely larger than peas: the nest is formed into a hollow ball, closely interwoven with moss and spiders webs, lined with the softest down, and having an aperture in the side. It builds generally in the forests; sometimes on the ivies and elms of our gardens, or on the pines beside our houses <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Lord Trevor found one of these nests in his garden on an ivy.

The smallest insects are the common food of these diminutive birds: in summer they catch these nimbly on the wing: in winter they seek the infects in their retreats, where they are tor∣pid or dead. They also eat the <HI>larvae,</HI> and all sorts of worms. They are so alert in discover∣ing and seizing their prey, and at the same time so great epicures, that sometimes they continue to swallow till they are surfeited. During sum∣mer they feed on small berries and seeds, such as those of fennel; and they also scrape the earth under old willows, where they probably find something nutritious. I never could dis∣cover small pebbles in their gizzard.</P>
<P>The gold-crested wrens delight in oaks, elms, tall pines, firs, junipers, &amp;c. In Silesia, says Schwenckfeld, they are seen both during the summer and the winter, and always in the fo∣rests. In England they inhabit the mountain woods. In Bavaria and Austria they resort in winter near the towns, where they find re∣sources for the severity of the season. It is said even that they fly in small flocks, which are composed not only of their own species, but of other birds which have the same modes of life,
<PB N="369" REF="402"/>
such as the creepers, the nuthatches, and the tit∣mice, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner, Klein, and Catesby.</NOTE> On the other hand, Salerne in∣forms us that, in Orleanois, they appear gene∣rally in pairs during the winter, and call upon each other when they are separated. It would seem, therefore, that they have different habits in different countries; which is not impossible, since habits depend on circumstances: but it is more likely that the authors have committed some oversight. In Switzerland, it is uncer∣tain whether they continue through the win∣ter: at least, in that country, and in England, they are the last to disappear <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.</NOTE>. In France, they are oftener seen in the autumn and win∣ter than in the summer; and there are many provinces where they seldom or never breed.</P>
<P>These little birds are very agile and active: they are almost continually in motion, flutter∣ing from branch to branch, creeping on the trees, and clinging indifferently in every situa∣tion, and often hanging by the feet, like the titmice; ferreting in all the cracks of the bark for their diminutive prey, or watching it as it creeps out. In cold weather they lodge in the evergreens, feeding on the seed; and often they perch on the summit of these trees: but in this
<PB N="370" REF="403"/>
habit they appear not to shun the presence of man, since, on other occasions, they suffer him to get very near them. In autumn they are fat, and their flesh is delicate: during that sea∣son they are commonly caught by means of the call. The public markets of Nuremberg are then well stocked with these little birds.</P>
<P>The gold-crested wrens are spread not only through Europe, from Sweden to Italy, and probably as far as Spain, but also to Bengal: and even in America they inhabit the extent between the Antilles and the north of New England, according to Edwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must have penetrated much farther, if it be really found in the <HI>Terrae Magellanicae,</HI> as asserted in the <HI>Naviga∣tions aux Terres Australes,</HI> t. ii. p. 38.

It appears therefore that these birds, which visit the northern countries indeed, but which fly to short distances, have migrated from the one con∣tinent to the other; and this well-ascertained fact is a proof of the proximity of the two continents in the high latitudes. If this be ad∣mitted, it would follow that the gold-orested wren, though apparently feeble and delicate, cannot only bear cold, but endure all the vi∣cissitudes of temperature.</P>

its beautiful aurora gold crown, bordered with black on each side, and which it conceals un∣der the other feathers by the contraction of the muscles of the head: a white ray, which, pass∣ing over its eyes, joins the black edging of the crown, and another black streak, in which the eye is placed, give a more marked physiog∣nomy: the rest of the upper side of the body, including the small coverts of the wings, is of an olive yellow: all the under side, from the base of the bill, is light rufous, verging to olive on the sides: the circumference of the bill is whitish, and projects some black bristles: the quills of the wings are brown, edged exteriorly with olive yellow: this border is interrupted, near the third of the quill, by a black spot on the sixth, and more or less on the following quills as far as the fifteenth: the middle coverts, and the great coverts next the body, are edged with olive yellow, and tipped with dirty white, which produces two spots of the same dirty white on each wing: the quills of the tail are dun gray, edged with olive: the ground colour of the feathers is blackish, except on the head, at the rise of the neck, and on the lower part of the thighs; the iris chesnut, and the legs yellowish. In the female the crest is of a pale yellow, and all the colours of the plumage are more dilute, as usual.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="405"/>
The Pennsylvanian gold-crested wren is dis∣tinguished from this only by slight shades, which are insufficient to constitute even a variety. The greatest difference lies in the colour of the legs, which are blackish.</P>
<P>Brisson says, that in the gold-crested wren, the first feather of each wing is extremely short: but this is not a quill, its shape is different, it is not inserted in the same manner, nor is it des∣tined for the same use: it rises from the end of a sort of nail which terminates the bone of the wing; and a similar feather sprouts from ano∣ther sort of nail, at the succeeding articula∣tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may extend this remark to many other species of birds, which have been said to have the first quill of the wing extremely short.</NOTE>.</P>

<P N="1">I. THE RUBY-CROWNED WREN. I can∣not help considering this Pennsylvanian bird as a variety in point of size of our gold-crested wren. In fact, its crest differs little either in shape or colour, being rounder indeed, and of a purer and deeper red, emulating the lustre of the ruby, and not edged with a black zone. Also the upper side of the body is olive, which is deeper on the fore parts, and lighter on the rump, without any mixture of yellow: there is a tint of yellow on the lower part of the body, and deeper on the breast. But the greatest difference consists in the size, it being larger and heavier than the common gold-crested wren in the proportion of eleven to eight. For the rest, the only difference consists in a few shades of the plumage: I speak of the dried speci∣mens, for the habits and oeconomy of the ruby-crowned wren are entirely unknown; and if ever these be discovered to be the same with those of our gold-crested wren, the identity of the species will be completely established.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="408"/>
In the ruby-crowned wrens, the crown is pe∣culiar to the males, and not the least trace of it can be found on the head of the female. How∣ever, the plumage is nearly the same in both, and their weights are exactly equal.</P>
<P>Total length, four inches and a quarter; the bill, five lines and a half; the alar extent, six lines and a half; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> eight lines; the middle toe six; the tail eighteen, and consists of twelve quills; it exceeds the wings about half an inch.</P>
<P>To this variety we may refer the bird which Lebeau found in Louisiana, in which the back of the head bears a sort of crimson crown. The measures are indeed a little different, but insuf∣ficient to constitute a new variety, and the more so, as in other respects the birds are analogous, and inhabit the same climate.</P>

<P>THOUGH Aldrovandus has restricted the word <HI>parra</HI> to the gold-crested wren, I con∣ceive that Pliny employed it to signify in gene∣ral the titmice, and that he regarded this genus as a branch of the family of woodpeckers, which he accounted more extensive than is admitted by the modern naturalists. My reasons are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. Pliny says, that the woodpeckers are the only birds which breed in hollow trees <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pullos educant in cavis avium soli.</HI> Lib. x. 18.</NOTE>; and it is well known that many species of titmice do the same.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="380" REF="413"/>
2. All that he says in regard to certain woodpeckers, that they climb the trees like cats, that they hang with their heads down∣ward, that they seek their food beneath the bark, that they strike it with their bill, &amp;c. agrees equally with the titmice and the wood∣peckers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scandentes in subrectum selium modo; illi vero &amp; supini percussi corticis sono, pabulum subesse intelligunt.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. The account which he gives of other woodpeckers that suspend their nest from the end of young branches, to prevent any qua∣druped from approaching it <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Picorum aliquis suspendit in surculo (nidum).... ut nullus accedere possit.</HI> Lib. x. 33.</NOTE>, will only suit some kinds of titmice, such as the penduline and the Languedoc, and not at all the wood∣peckers properly so called.</P>
<P N="4">4. We scarce can suppose, that Pliny never heard of the penduline and Languedoc titmice, since one of them at least breeds in Italy; and it is equally improbable that, being acquainted with this fact, he would omit to insert it in his Natural History. But the passage alluded to is the only one that applies to these birds; and they must therefore have been included in the family of woodpeckers.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="414"/>
Moreover, the appellation of <HI>parrae</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In genere parrarum est, cui nidus ex musco arido ita ab∣soluta perficitur pila, ut inveniri non possit aditus.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 33. See Belon, p. 343.</NOTE> seems to have been peculiarly bestowed on this branch of the woodpeckers; for in the genus of <HI>parrae,</HI> says Pliny, there are some which form their nest of dry moss into a ball, and shut it so closely that the aperture can scarce be found. This applies to the common wren, which has been sometimes confounded with the gold-crested wren and the titmice. There is another species which builds in the same manner, only employing hemp and flax for the materials; and this is the property of the long-tailed titmouse. Since the name <HI>parrae</HI> therefore comprehended many species, and the account of these agrees with the quali∣ties of the titmice, it will follow that the genus is really that of the titmice. This idea is the more probable, as the epithet <HI>argatilis,</HI> which is given by Pliny to one of these species, is so like the Greek name <HI>aigithalos,</HI> which Aristotle applies to the titmice, that we cannot help regarding it the same, only somewhat altered in transcrip∣tion. Besides, Pliny uses the word <HI>aigithalos</HI> in no other part, though he was well acquainted with Aristotle's works, and had consulted them expressly in composing his tenth book, which
<PB N="382" REF="415"/>
treats of these birds. I may add, that the term <HI>argatilis</HI> has never, as far as I know, been ap∣plied by authors to any other bird but the one just mentioned, and there is every reason therefore to conclude that it is a titmouse.</P>
<P>The titmice have also been confounded with the bee-eaters, because they are both <HI>apivorous:</HI> they have been confounded too with the goat-suckers, on account of the resemblance of the Greek names <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is commonly reckoned a primitive word, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is compounded of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a goat, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a nip∣ple. T.</NOTE> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, though Gesner suspects they are distinct in their ety∣mology: besides, the titmice have never been accused of milking the goats.</P>
<P>All the birds of this tribe appear feeble, be∣cause they are very small: but they are at the same time lively, active, and bold: they are perpetually in motion; they flutter from tree to tree; they hop from branch to branch; they creep along the bark; they climb the sides of walls; they suspend themselves in all situations, and often their head downwards, in order to dig in every little cranny, and pick out the worms, the insects, or their eggs. They also feed on seeds; but, instead of breaking these in their bill, like the linnets and the goldfinches,
<PB N="383" REF="416"/>
almost all the titmice hold them under their lit∣tle claws and peck them: they also pierce hazel nuts and walnuts, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this exercise is rather laborious, and, according to Frisch, brings on blindness, it is advised to break the nuts and hempseed, in short, every hard substance given to them.</NOTE> If a nut be suspended at the end of a thread, they will cling to it, follow the oscillations, and without quitting their hold they will continue to peck it.

The latter opinion seems to be the most probable.</NOTE>. During all the winter months,
<PB N="384" REF="417"/>
and even in the beginning of the spring, they subsist on dry seeds and on fragments of insects which they find by ferreting the trees. They also crop the opening buds, and eat the cater∣pillar's eggs, particularly those which are seen round the small branches ranged like a series of rings, or the wreaths of a spiral. Lastly, they search in the fields for small dead birds, or such as are exhausted by disease, or entangled in snares, and, in short, all those incapable of resistance, though of their own species; they pierce their scull, and feed upon the brains. Nor is this cruelty palliated by want; for they are guilty of it even in voleries, where they are abundantly supplied. In summer they eat not only almonds, walnuts, insects, &amp;c. but all sorts of nuts, chesnuts, beech-mast, figs, the seeds of hemp, of panic, and other small seeds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some pretend that the titmice cannot digest the seeds of rape or of millet, though these be softened by boiling; yet M. de Querhoënt, who raised some of these birds, assures me that he fed them only with hempseed and millet.</NOTE>. It is observed that those bred in the cage are fond of blood, tainted meat, rancid fat, and tallow melted, or rather burnt, by the flame of a candle. It would seem that the state of domestication vitiates their taste.</P>
<P>In general, the titmice, though tainted with fcrocity, love the society of their equals, and
<PB N="385" REF="418"/>
unite in numerous flocks: if they are parted by any accident, they mutually call on each other, and soon re-assemble. However, they seem to shun an intimate connection <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journal de Physique, Aout</HI> 1776, p. 123, &amp;c.</NOTE>: judging no doubt of the dispositions of others by their own, they feel that they cannot confide much in them: such is the society of rogues. The unions which they annually form in the spring are of a closer nature, and are very productive. No genus of birds is so prolific as that of the titmice <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So well known this fact is in England, that it is usual to call a little prolific woman a titmouse.</NOTE>, and it is the more remarkable the smaller they are. We might suppose that a greater proportion of organic matter enters into their structure, and from this exuberance of life results their fecundity, and also their activity, strength, and courage. No birds attack the owl with such intrepidity; they are ever the first to dart on the nocturnal foe, and they aim constantly at the eyes: their action is attended with a swell of the feathers, and with a rapid succession of violent attitudes and rapid move∣ments, which powerfully mark the bitterness of their rage. When they are caught, they bite keenly the finger of the bird-catcher, strike suriously with their bill, and invite, by their
<PB N="386" REF="419"/>
loud screams, the other birds of their species, which also fall into the snare, and in their turn decoy others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journal de Physique, Aoút</HI> 1776, p. 123.</NOTE>.

Such are the numerous methods of destroying these small birds, and almost all o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these are successfully employed. The reason is
<PB N="387" REF="420"/>
that people who keep bees suffer much from the titmice, which make great havoc among these useful insects, especially when they have young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Others say, that winter is the time when these birds destroy the most, because the bees, being then less animated, are not so formidable with their stings, and are more easily caught.</NOTE>. Their extreme vivacity drives them into every kind of snare, especially on their ar∣rival; for at that time they are very tame, they lodge in the bushes, and flutter about the roads, allowing one to get near them; but afterwards they gain some experience, and become rather more shy.</P>
<P>They lay about eighteen or twenty eggs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A female, says Hebert, that was caught on her eggs, had the skin of her belly so loose, that it would have co∣vered the belly entirely, though the bird had been twice as large.</NOTE>: some deposit these in the holes of trees, which they round and smooth with their bill, and fashion them internally into the proper form; others lay them in ball-shaped nests, which are of a magnitude very disproportioned to so small a bird. We might almost suppose that they previously reckon the number of the eggs, and that they anticipate the affection to their expected offspring. Hence the precau∣tions used in constructing the nest; the solici∣tude
<PB N="388" REF="421"/>
which some species discover in suspending it from the end of a branch, and the attention in selecting the proper materials, such as slen∣der grass, small roots, moss, thread, hair, wool-cotton, feathers, down, &amp;c. They are able to provide subsistence for their numerous family which implies not only indefatigable activity but much address and skill. They are often seen returning with caterpillars in their bill. If other birds attack their progeny, they will make an intrepid defence; will dart on the enemy; and courage renders their weakness formidable.</P>
<P>All the titmice have white spots round th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eyes: the outer toe is joined, at its origin, to the middle toe, which is a very little longer than the hind toe: the tongue seems truncated and terminated by filaments: in almost all of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are thickly feathered on the rump: all, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the blue one, the head is black or marked with black; in all, except the long-tailed one, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> legs are lead-coloured: but what more parti∣cularly characterises the birds of this family, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the bill is not awl-shaped, as some syste∣matic writers assert, but formed like a sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cone, a little flattened on the sides: it is stronge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and shorter than that of the <HI>fauvettes,</HI> and often shaded by the feathers of the forehead, which
<PB N="389" REF="422"/>
rise and bend forward: their nostrils are co∣vered with other smaller and fixed feathers; and their economy and habits are also similar.</P>
<P>It may be worth remarking, that the titmice bear some analogy to the ravens the magpies, and the shrikes, in regard to the comparative force of their bill and their little talons, in their mustachoes round the bill, in their appetite for flesh, in their manner of tearing their food into morsels before they eat; and even, it is said, in their cries, and in their mode of flying: but still we ought not to refer them to the same genus, as Kramer has done. We need only to compare these birds, to see them creeping on the trees, to examine their external shape and their proportions, and to reflect on their pro∣digious fecundity, and we shall be convinced that the titmice are widely different from the ravens. Besides, though the titmice fight among themselves, and sometimes devour each other, particularly certain species which discover a violent antipathy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such are the ox-eye and the cinereous nun. See <HI>Jour∣nal de Physique, Août</HI> 1776. It is also said, that if several titmice be successively put in the same cage, the one first domesticated will attack the new comers, will domineer over them, and will endeavour to kill them and suck their brains.</NOTE>; they sometimes live on good terms with one another, and even with
<PB N="390" REF="423"/>
birds of other species; and we may assert that they are not radically so cruel as the shrikes, and only apt to be transported by momentary pas∣sion, in certain circumstances which are little known. I have witnessed a case, where, far from taking advantage of their strength, when no resistance could have been made, they shewed themselves susceptible of pity and affection. I put two young black titmice, taken from the nest, in a cage, where was a blue titmouse: she adopted them, and treated them with the ten∣derness of a mother; shared her food with them, and even was attentive to break the seeds mixed with it when too hard. I much doubt if a shrike would have treated them so kindly.</P>
<P>These birds are spread through the whole of the ancient continent, from Denmark and Swe∣den to the Cape of Good Hope, where Kolben saw six species, viz. the great titmouse; the marsh titmouse; the blue, the long-tailed, the black-headed titmice; and the gold-crested wren, which he took for a titmouse. "All these kinds sing pleasantly," says this traveller, "and like Canary finches, with which they mix to form magnificent savage concerts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I own that I lay little stress on this observation, in which Kolben, instead of relating what he saw, seems to copy what he read in naturalists, only taking the liberty to assert that the titmice sing like canaries, while these authors compare their song rather to that of the chaffinches.</NOTE>." Our bird-fan∣ciers
<PB N="391" REF="424"/>
pretend that those of Europe also sing well; but this must be understood of their ver∣nal song, which is the music of love, and not of the disagreeable harsh cry which they retain throughout the year, and which has procured them, it is said, the name of <HI>locksmith</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not agree with authors on this point; for the name of <HI>locksmith (serrurier)</HI> has been given to the wood∣peckers, not because of their cry, but on account of the grating noise made by striking the trees with their bill. It seems to me more probable that, as the titmice have the same habit, they have, for a like reason, received the same name.</NOTE>. These connoisseurs add, that they can be taught to whistle airs: that the young ones, which are caught after they are partly grown, succeed bet∣ter than those fed artificially <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Traité du Serin,</HI> p. 51. Every body agrees that the young titmice, taken from the nest, are difficult to raise.</NOTE>: that they soon grow tame, and begin to sing in the course of ten or twelve days: lastly, that they are very subject to the cramp, and ought to be kept warm during winter.</P>
<P>Almost all the titmice, whether they enjoy the state of liberty, or be confined in a volery, form deposits for their provisions. The Vis∣count Querhoënt observed several, whose wings he had clipped, take in their bill three or four
<PB N="392" REF="425"/>
seeds of panic, and a seed of hemp <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch says nearly the same thing of the cinereous nun, or marsh titmouse.</NOTE>, and scramble with remarkable agility to the top of the tapestry, where they had placed their ma∣gazine. But it is obvious, that this instinct of storing proceeds from avarice, and not foresight; at least in the case of those which usually spend the summer in the mountains, and subsist dur∣ing winter in the plains. It has also been ob∣served, that they constantly seek the darkest spots in which to repose: they would even seem to strive in hollowing out recesses in the boards or the wall; and these attempts are always at a certain height; for they seldom rest on the ground, and never remain long at the bottom of the cage. Hebert took notice of some spe∣cies which passed the night in hollow trees: he perceived them several times dart briskly into their lodgment, after they had previously glanced round, and, as it were, examined the ground: he tried to drive them out by pushing a stick into the same hole by which they en∣tered, but without effect. He supposes that they return every day to the same roost; which is the more probable, since this also contains their little store of provisions. These birds sleep soundly, with their head concealed be∣neath
<PB N="393" REF="426"/>
their wings, as others. Their flesh is in general lean, bitter, and dry, and consequently very bad food: however, there are some ex∣ceptions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner says, that they are eaten in Switzerland; but he adds, that they are by no means pleasant food.—Schwenckfeld alone asserts, that their flesh is neither dry, nor ill-tasted, in autumn and in winter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The largest of all the titmice are, among the European kinds, the great and bearded titmice; and among the foreign kinds, the blue titmouse of India, and the Toupet titmouse of Carolina: each of these weighs near an ounce. The smallest of all are the black-headed titmouse, the long-tailed titmouse, the marsh titmouse, the penduline titmouse, and the crested Caro∣lina titmouse; which exceed not two or three gros.</P>
<P>We shall begin the particular history of the different species, with those of Europe, attending to the characteristic properties of each; and we shall then treat of the foreign kinds.

<P>I KNOW not what induced Belon to assert that "this species does not hang so much from the branches as the others;" for I had occasion to observe one which continually sus∣pended itself from the bars of the upper part of its cage; and, happening to sicken, it still clung to these with its head turned downwards, and continued in this pendent situation during the whole of its illness, and even after its death.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="428"/>
I have also learned from experience, that the ox-eye kept in the cage sometimes cleaves the skull of the young birds that are presented to it, and feeds greedily on the brain. Hebert as∣certained nearly the same fact by an experiment which he made: he put a red-breast in the same cage with eight or ten ox-eyes, about nine in the morning; and against mid-day the scull of the red-breast was bored, and the brain entire∣ly eaten. On the other hand, I have seen many ox-eyes, and other titmice, which had been caught by means of the call, that lived above a year in the same volery, without any act of hostility: and, at this very moment, there is an ox-eye which has lived six months on good terms with goldfinches and siskins; though one of the siskins was sick during that period, and, in its feeble state, incapable of resistance, offered an easy prey to voracity.</P>
<P>The great titmouse inhabits the mountains and the valleys, among the bushes and the copses, in the vineyards and the forests: but M. Lottinger assures me that they prefer the moun∣tains. The ordinary cry of the male, which it retains through the whole year, and which is most frequent in the evening preceding rain, re∣sembles the grating of a file, or the grinding of a bolt; and hence, it is said, the appellation of <HI>locksmith.</HI> In spring, however, it assumes ano∣ther
<PB N="396" REF="429"/>
modulation, and becomes so pleasant and varied, that we could hardly suppose it to pro∣ceed from the same bird. Frisch, Guys, and several others compare it with that of the finch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This bird is kept in the cage in certain countries, says Aldrovandus, for the sake of the pleasant warble which it has the whole year. On the other hand, Turner says, that its vernal song is not agreeable, and that the rest of the year it is mute. According to some, it seems to sound <HI>titigu, ti∣tigu, titigu,</HI> and in the spring <HI>stiti, stiti,</HI> &amp;c. In general, authors often erect their local observations into universal axioms; and sometimes they barely repeat what they have heard from persons little informed: and hence the contra∣dictions.</NOTE>; and hence perhaps the reason of the name <HI>finch titmouse,</HI> which has been given to this species. Olina allows that the ox-eye excels all the other titmice in singing, and as a call bird. It is ea∣sily tamed, and grows so familiar as to eat out of the hand: it is dexterous at the little trick of drawing up the pail, and it even lays while in captivity.</P>
<P>When these birds enjoy their natural free∣dom, they begin to pair about the first of Fe∣bruary: they make their nest in the hole of a tree, or wall <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Particularly in the walls of lone houses, near forests: for instance, those of charcoal makers <HI>(charbonniers);</HI> whence, according to some, the titmouse has the name of <HI>charbonniere.</HI></NOTE>: but they consort a long time before they construct it, and they select the softest
<PB N="397" REF="430"/>
and the most downy materials. They com∣monly have eight, ten, or even twelve eggs, with rufous spots, chiefly at the large end. The period of incubation exceeds not twelve days: the young brood continue several days blind: they are soon covered with a thin slender down, which adheres to the end of the fea∣thers, and drops off as these grow. They fly in the space of fifteen days; and it has been observed that their growth is more rapid in rainy seasons. After they have once quitted the nests, they return no more, but perch on the neighbouring trees, and incessantly call on each other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is perhaps an effect of this early habit, that the tit∣mice run so nimbly when they hear the voice of their fel∣lows.</NOTE>: they continue thus in a body, till the approach of spring invites them to pair. The nestlings are found till the end of June, which shews that the ox-eyes have several hatches. Some say that they have three: but is it not when they are disturbed in the first hatch that they begin a second, &amp;c.? Before the first moulting the male may be distinguished, since he is larger, and of a hotter temper. In the space of six months the young are all full grown, and four months after moulting they are fit for breeding. According to Olina, these
<PB N="398" REF="431"/>
birds live only five years; and others mention that age as the time when they begin to be afflicted with defluxion of the eyes, the cramp, &amp;c. But they lose their activity without losing the harshness of their character, which is aggra∣vated by their infirmities <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journal de Physique, Août</HI> 1776.</NOTE>. Linnaeus says, that in Sweden they lodge on alders, and that in summer they are very common in Spain.</P>
<P>The great titmouse has on its head a sort of cowl of a bright glossy black, which before and behind descends to the middle of the neck, and has on each side a large white spot almost trian∣gular: below this cowl rises before a long nar∣row black bar, which extends across the middle of the breast and belly to the extremity of the inferior coverts of the tail: these are white, and also those of the lower belly: the rest of the under surface of the body, as far as the black on the throat, is of a light yellow: an olive green prevails on the upper side of the body, but becomes yellow, and even white, as it ap∣proaches the lower edge of the cowl: it grows duskier, on the contrary, at the opposite side, and changes into a blue ash colour on the rump and the superior coverts of the tail: the two first quills of the wing are of a brown cinereous, without edgings: the rest of the great quills
<PB N="399" REF="432"/>
are bordered with blue ash, and the middle ones with olive green, which assumes a yellow tinge on the four last: the wings have a transverse ray of yellowish white: all that appears of the quills of the tail is blueish cinereous, except the outermost, which is edged with white, and the next, which is tipped with the same co∣lour: the ground of the black feathers is black, and of the white ones white: that of the yellow ones is blackish, and that of the olive ones cinereous.

<P>THE name of black-head <HI>(atricapilla,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) has been applied to several birds, such as the black-cap, the bulfinch, &amp;c. But the black-head of Aristotle appears to be a titmouse; since, according to him, it lays seventeen, or even twenty-one eggs, and has besides all the properties of the titmice; such as nestling in trees, feeding on insects, having a truncated tongue, &amp;c. What this author adds from report, and which Pliny confidently repeats, that the eggs are always odd, is founded on the notion of certain mysterious properties of numbers, especially of the odd ones, which have ever been supposed to influence the phae∣nomena of nature.</P>

The colemouse differs from the ox-eye, not only in regard to size, being no more than the third or fourth of the weight, but also by the colours of its plumage; as will appear by comparing the descriptions. Frisch says, that in Germany it inhabits the pine forests; but in Sweden it prefers the alders, according to Lin∣naeus. It it the least timorous of all the tit∣mice: not only the young ones flock to the voice of another titmouse, and are decoyed by means of the call; even the adults, which have been caught several times and have fortunately escaped, are as easily ensnared again in the same gins. However, these birds discover as much or even more sagacity in many actions which concern their own preservation, or that of their brood; and perhaps the courage which they possess extinguishes alike mistrust and fear.</P>
<P>The colemouse lives in the woods, especially those which contain firs and other evergreen trees, in vineyards, and gardens: it creeps and runs on the trees like the other titmice. Next to the long-tailed one, it is the smallest of all; it weights only two gros: it has a fort of black cowl, terminated with white on the back of the head, and marked below the eyes with the same colour: the upper side of the head is ci∣nereous,
<PB N="403" REF="437"/>
the under dirty white: there are two transverse white spots on the wings; the quills of the tail and of the wings, brown ash colour, edged with gray: the bill black, and the legs lead-coloured.</P>
<P>Total length, four inches and a quarter; the bill, four lines and two-thirds; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> seven lines; the hind nail is the strongest; the lateral ones are proportionally longer than in the ox-eye: the alar extent, six inches and three quarters; the tail, twenty lines, and rather forked, consisting of twelve quills; it exceeds the wings ten lines.</P>

<P>I KNOW that many naturalists regard this bird as distinguished from the preceding by con∣siderable differences. Willughby says that it is larger, its tail longer, and that it has less black under its throat; that the white of the lower side of its body is purer, and that it has no white on the back of the head, or on the wings.

<P>The marsh titmouse lives more in the woods than in the vineyards and gardens, feeding on small seeds, preying on wasps, bees and gras∣hoppers, and forming stores of hemp seeds, when there is occasion, carrying several at once in its bill to place in the deposit, and consuming them afterwards at leisure. Its manner of eat∣ing undoubtedly gives it this foresight: it re∣quires time and a convenient place to pierce each seed with its bill; and if it had not collect∣ed provisions, it would often be reduced to want.</P>
<P>The marsh titmouse is found in Sweden, and even in Norway, in the forests which skirt the Danube, in Lorraine, in Italy, &amp;c. Salerne says that it is unknown in the Orleanois, in the neighbourhood of Paris, and in Normandy. It is fond of lodging among the alders, the sallows, and of haunting wet spots. It is a soli∣tary bird, which continues in the country

through the whole year; it can hardly be bred in the cage. A nest was brought to me which was found in a hollow apple-tree in the midst of a little clump, not far from a river: it consisted of a little moss laid in the bottom of the hole. The young ones, which were al∣ready able to fly, were rather browner than the parent, but their legs were of a lighter lead colour; no scaloping on the edges of the bill, of which the two mandibles were very equal. What was remarkable, the gizzard of the young ones was larger than that of the adults in the ratio of five to three; the intestinal tube was also proportionally longer; but neither of them had a gall bladder or the least vestige of a <HI>caecum.</HI> I found in the gizzard of the parent some frag∣ments of insects and a grain of dry earth, and in that of the young ones several little pebbles.</P>

<P>FEW birds are so well known as this; be∣cause few are so common, so easily caught, or so distinguished by the colours of their plumage. Blue predominates on the upper side, yellow on the lower; and a nice distribution of black and white discriminates and heightens the different hues, which are also diversified by a variety of different shades. The blue titmouse is the better known on account of its pernicious visits to our gardens, where it plucks the blossoms from the fruit-trees: it even dexterously employs its little claws to detach the ripe fruit from the branch, which it after∣wards carries to its deposit. But it does not subsist wholly in this way; it has the same
<PB N="413" REF="447"/>
propensity to flesh with other titmice, and it picks so clean the bodies of the little birds which it masters, that Klein proposes to em∣ploy it for preparing their skeletons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He advises us previously to remove most of the flesh and the brain of the bird, whose skeleton we want to have prepared.</NOTE>. It also distinguishes itself above all the rest by its ran∣cour against the owl. The Viscount de Quer∣hoënt observes, that it does not always split the seeds of hemp like the other titmice, but bruises them in its bill, like the canaries and linnets: he adds, that it shews more foresight than the rest, since it selects for its winter haunt a warmer site, and one of more difficult access; commonly a hollow tree, or the crevice of a wall.</P>
<P>The female also builds in holes, and is not spar∣ing of feathers; she lays in the month of April a great many small white eggs: I have counted from eight to seventeen in the same nest; others have found even twenty-one. I am assured that there is only one hatch, unless the incubation is disturbed: a single egg broken, or even handled, will occasion the whole to be forsaken. But after the young are excluded, the mother discovers a strong attachment, and defends them with courage; she is inflamed, and whistles a
<PB N="414" REF="448"/>
threatening air when disturbed in her prison. The cock seems to repose more at ease, and oftenest clung to the top of the cage. Besides the disagreeable grinding, it has a slender but varied chirp, which has been supposed to bear some resemblance to that of the chaffinch.</P>
<P>Frisch alleges that the blue titmouse will not live in the cage, and cannot therefore be used as a call-bird. I have seen some, however, that were kept many months in confinement, and died only of excessive fat.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld tells us, that in Silesia this tit∣mouse is found at all seasons on the mountains. With us, it prefers the woods, especially in sum∣mer, and next to these the vineyards, the gar∣dens, &amp;c. Lottinger says, that it travels in company with the ox-eye; but the society be∣tween petulant and cruel animals must be tur∣bulent and temporary. It is said that its young continue longer together than that of the other species <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journal de Physique, Août</HI> 1776.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The blue titmouse is very little, since it weighs only three gros: but Belon, Klein, and the traveller Kolben, ought not to have repre∣sented it as the smallest of the titmice. The hen is rather smaller than the cock, and has less
<PB N="415" REF="449"/>
blue on the head; and this blue, as well as the yellow of the under side of the body, is not so bright: what is white in the parents, is only yellowish in the new-fledged brood: what is blue in the former, is ash brown in the latter; but their wing quills are proportionally as large as those of the adults.</P>
<P>Total length, four inches and a half; the bill, four lines and a half; the two mandibles equal, and without any indenting; the tongue trun∣cated, terminated with filaments, some of which are commonly broken; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> six lines and a half; the legs are exceedingly thick, the hind nail the strongest; the alar extent, seven inches; the tail twenty-five lines, and projecting twelve beyond the wings; each of its halves is tapered, and composed of six quills.

Albin says were reported to inhabit the coun∣ties of Essex and Lincoln, and always among the fens?</P>
<P>It is to be wished that the habits of these birds were better known. Their history would be curious, if we may judge from what is re∣lated, that when they rest the male spreads his wings over his mate; and this attention, were it well authenticated, must imply many other interesting particulares with regard to incuba∣tion.</P>
<P>The most characteristic feature of the male is a black mark, very nearly triangular, on each side of the head: the base of this inverted tri∣angle rises a little above the eyes, and its ver∣tex is turned downwards, and falls on the neck nine or ten lines from the base: these two black marks, which have pretty long feathers, bear some resemblance to whiskers, and hence the names of the bird in different countries. Frisch supposes that it is analogous to the canary, and that the two species would intermix; but adds, that the bearded titmice are too rare for making the necessary experiments. This opi∣nion of Frisch is inconsistent with that of Ed∣wards and Linnaeus, who suppose it to resemble the shrike. But though these views be opposite, they agree in one circumstance, that the bill of the bearded titmouse is larger than or∣dinary
<PB N="418" REF="453"/>
in titmice. On the other hand, Lottin∣ger affirms that it breeds in the holes of trees, and often consorts with the long-tailed titmouse; which, joined to the family likeness and other resemblances in size, exterior figure, mien, and habits, rank it with the titmice.</P>
<P>The head of the male is pearl gray; the throat, and the fore part of the neck, of a silvery white; the breast of a sullied white tinged with gray in some subjects, and rose-colour in others; the rest of the under side of the body rusty; the inferior coverts of the tail black; those of the wings yellowish white; the upper side of the body light rufous; the anterior edge of the wings white; the small superior coverts black∣ish; the great ones edged with rufous, the middle ones with the same, edged interiorly with lighter rufous; the great quills edged with white externally; those of the tail entirely ru∣fous, except the outermost, which is blackish a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the base, and of a rufous ash colour near it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extremity; the iris orange; the bill yellowish and the legs brown.</P>
<P>In the female there is no red tinge under th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> body, nor black marks on the sides of the head which is brown, and also the inferior coverts o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tail, of which the lateral quills are blackish tipt with white.

<P>EDWARDS suspects this bird, which is fi∣gured in the work of Albin, to be the same with the bearded titmouse; but this idea seems contradicted by several circumstances: 1. The figures referred to, though accurate, differ con∣siderably. 2. According to Albin, the bearded titmouse weighs more than nine gros; and he represents the mountain titmouse as equal to the
<PB N="421" REF="456"/>
blue titmouse, which is only three gros. 3. The plumage is different; and particularly the black bar on the side of the head has a very different position in each. 4. The climate also differs: for Albin makes some of the coun∣ties in England the ordinary haunt of the bearded titmouse; but regards the penduline titmouse as an inhabitant of Germany and Italy. Nor do Kramer and Linnaeus appear to judge better in considering these two birds as distin∣guished only by their sex; and I cannot, with Edwards and Linnaeus, perceive any strong re∣semblance between these and the shrikes. It is true that the shrikes have a black stripe on the eyes, and that the penduline titmouse inter∣weaves its nest; but the materials are different, and also the manner of fastening the nest, the shape of the bill, the claws, the food, the size, proportions, strength, gesture, &amp;c. It would seem that neither Edwards, nor any of the na∣turalists who have adopted his opinion, had ever seen this bird.</P>
<P>The most curious fact in the history of these birds is the exquisite art displayed in the con∣struction of their nest. They employ the light down found on the buds of the willow, the poplar, the aspen, the juncago; in thistles, dan∣delions, flea-banes, cats' tails, &amp;c. With their
<PB N="422" REF="457"/>
bill they entwine this filamentous substance, and form a thick close web, almost like cloth: this they fortify externally with fibres and small roots, which penetrate into the tex∣ture, and in some measure form the basis of the nest. They line the inside with the same down, but not woven, that their young may lie soft <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the down, or cotton-like substance, is rolled into little pellets, which make the inside of the nest neither so soft nor so pleasant.</NOTE>: they shut it above to confine the warmth, and they suspend it with hemp, with nettles, &amp;c. from the cleft of a small pliant branch, over running water, that it may rock more gently, assisted by the spring of the branch. In this situation the brood are well supplied with insects, which constitute their chief food <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Monti found in the stomach of these birds insects almost digested, and nothing else.</NOTE>; and they are protected from the rats, the lizards, the adders, and other rep∣tiles, which are always the most dangerous: and I am convinced that their conduct really proceeds from foresight; for they are naturally crafty, and, according to Monti and Titius <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">They are sometimes, adds Titius, surprised in the nest at sun-set, or in dark misty weather.</NOTE>, they can never be caught in snares; as the same circumstance has been remarked in the bonanas
<PB N="423" REF="458"/>
and cassiques of the New World, in the gros∣beaks of Abyssinia, and in other birds which hang their nests from the end of a branch. That of the penduline titmouse resembles some∣times a bag, sometimes a shut purse, sometimes a flattened bagpipe, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cajetan Monti has caused one to be engraved, and Daniel Titius two. These three nests differ not only from each other, but from that figured by Bonanni, both in size and form. The largest of all (Titius, <HI>pl.</HI> 2.) was seven inches long, and four and an half wide: it was suspended at the fork of a small branch with hemp and flax. The least <HI>(pl.</HI> 1.) was five inches and an half long, of the same breadth at its upper part, and terminating in an obtuse point: this, according to Titius, is the usual form. That of Monti was pointed above and below. Titius suspects that the penduline titmice only make a rude essay in con∣structing their first nest, and that the sides are then thin, and the texture quite loose; but that they improve at each sub∣sequent hatch; and, as their mistrust grows upon them, they add firmer coats on the outside, and softer ones within: hence the differences observed in the form and bulk of these nests. About the end of December 1691, near Breslaw, was found a female siskin in one of these same nests, with a young one, and three eggs not yet hatched. This proves that the nests of the penduline titmice subsist from one year to another. Titius adds, that we need not wonder to see the siskin hatching in winter, since the cross-bills do the same.</NOTE> The aperture is made in the side, and almost always turned towards the water, and placed sometimes higher, sometimes lower: it is nearly round, and only an inch and an half in diameter, or even less, and com∣monly

An anonymous author of a Memoir in the <HI>Journal de Phy∣sique</HI> for August 1776, goes farther than Aldrovandus, and after having compared the penduline and long-tailed tit∣mouse, observes a great analogy between the two birds. Yet had he followed the method of comparison exactly, he would have perceived that the penduline titmouse has its bill and legs proportionally longer, its tail shorter, its alar extent also, and its plumage different.</NOTE>; though this is sometimes wanting. The female lays only four or five eggs, which falls much short of the ordinary fecundity of the titmice; but in its port, its voice, its bill, and in the principal attributes, the pen∣duline resembles the others. These eggs are as white as snow, the shell extremely thin, and they are almost transparent. The bird has ge∣nerally two hatches annually; the first in April or May, and the second in the month of Au∣gust. There is little probability that it makes a third.</P>
<P>These nests of the penduline titmouse are seen in the fens near Bologna, in those of Tus∣cany, on the lake Thrasymene, and are exactly
<PB N="425" REF="460"/>
the same with what occur in Lithuania, Volhi∣nia, Poland, and Germany. The peasants re∣gard them with superstitious veneration: one of these nests is suspended near the door of each cottage, and the possessors hold it as a protector from thunder, and its little architect as a sacred bird. We might almost regret that nature is not more sparing of her wonders: for every extra∣ordinary appearance is a source of new errors.</P>
<P>These titmice inhabit likewise Bohemia, Si∣lesia, the Ukraine, Russia, Siberia, and where∣ever, in short, those plants grow that furnish the cotton for constructing their nests <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel Titius remarks that Volhinia, Polesia, Lithua∣nia, and other cantons of Poland, abound with marshes, and aquatic plants or trees, such as willows, alders, pop∣lars, knapweeds, starworts, hawkweeds, juncagos, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<PB N="426" REF="461"/>
and the more northern countries. They almost always haunt the marshes, and hide themselves among the bulrushes, and the foliage of the trees which grow in such situations. It is as∣serted that they never migrate on the approach of winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cajetan Monti and Daniel Titius.</NOTE>. Such may be the case in tem∣perate countries, where insects are found through the whole year: but, in the northern climates, I should suppose that the penduline tit∣mice at least change their haunts during the in∣tense colds; and, like the other titmice, resort to the inhabited spots. Accordingly, Kramer informs us that, in the vicinity of the city of Pruck, they are much more numerous in win∣ter than in any other season; and that they al∣ways lodge, from preference, in the bulrushes and reeds.</P>
<P>It is said that they have a warble, though not well known. Yet the young ones taken from the nest have been kept several years, and fed solely on ants' eggs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Titius, p. 43, 44. In another place he says, that they sing better than the long-tailed titmouse, which, ac∣cording to Belon, has a pleasant song.</NOTE>: therefore they sing not in the cage.</P>
<P>The plumage of this bird is very ordinary: the crown of the head is whitish; the back of
<PB N="427" REF="462"/>
the head, and the upper side of the neck, cine∣reous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel Titius saw a blackish spot near the first vertebra of the neck, and another near the anus.</NOTE>; all the upper side of the body gray, but tinged with rusty in the fore part; the throat, all the under side of the body, white, tinged with cinereous gray before, and rusty behind: there is a black bar on the face, that extends on both sides to the eyes, and much be∣yond them; the superior coverts of the wings brown, edged with rufous, which becomes gra∣dually more dilute near the extremity; the quills of the tail and of the wings brown also, but edged with whitish; the bill cinereous; the legs reddish cinereous.</P>
<P>It appears, from the description of Cajetan Monti, that in Italy the penduline titmice have more rufous in their plumage, and a slight tinge of green on the superior coverts of their wings, &amp;c. and, from that of Gmelin, that those in Siberia have the back brown, the head white, and the breast tinged with rufous. But these are only variations occasioned by the climate, or perhaps owing to the difference of description; for a considerable diversity of ap∣pearance will arise from the distance they are held from the eye, and the light with which they are viewed.</P>

to the penduline titmouse, but not as a mere variety: the differences in its size, its pro∣portions, its colours, the shape of its nest, &amp;c. are fully sufficient to constitute it another spe∣cies.</P>
<P>The nest is very large, compared with the size of the bird; shut above, and has nearly the bulk and shape of an ostrich's egg: its greater axis is six inches; its smaller axis, three and an half. It is suspended from the fork of a flexible poplar branch; and, to give greater stability, it is wrapped with wool, for the space of more than seven or eight inches; and the down of the poplar, the willow, &amp;c. is also used. The aperture is placed in the side near the upper part, and has also a sort of projection, or penthouse, that juts eighteen lines.

<PB REF="468"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="433" REF="469"/>
of the titmice: its bill is short, yet pretty strong: its chief residence is in the woods; it is active and restless, fluttering incessantly from bush to bush, from shrub to shrub; running among the branches, hanging by the feet; lives in society, attending to the call of its compa∣nions; feeds on caterpillars, flies, and other insects, sometimes seeds; crops the buds from the trees; lays a great many eggs: in fine, according to the most accurate observations, it has the principal exterior characters of the tit∣mice; and, what is more decisive, it has their habits and oeconomy. Nor is the long tapered tail entirely distinct from those of all the other titmice, since those of the bearded and penduline kinds are somewhat of the same form.</P>
<P>With regard to the mode of constructing its nest, it follows a middle plan between that of the ox-eye and colemouse and that of the penduline titmouse. It does not conceal it in the hole of a tree, which would be ill adapted for its long tail, and it seldom or never hangs it to a slender string; but it fixes it firmly in
<PB N="434" REF="470"/>
the branches of shrubs, three or four feet from the ground; works it into an oval, and almost cylindrical form; closes it above, leaving only an aperture of an inch in the side, and often makes two opposite holes, to avoid the inconvenience of turning <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch and Rzaczynski.</NOTE>; a precaution the more useful, as the tail quills are easily de∣tached, and drop with the slightest ruffling <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence it has been called <HI>lose-tail</HI> (perd-sa-queue).</NOTE>. The nest differs from that of the penduline tit∣mouse in other circumstances also: it is larger <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I measured one of these nests, which was eight inches high, and four wide.</NOTE>, of a more cylindrical form; its texture is not so close; its little aperture has seldom the pro∣tuberant brim <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cajetan Monti and Daniel Titius, compared together.</NOTE>; its outer coat consists of stalks of herbs, moss, lichens, and, in short, of the coarser materials; and the inside is lined with a great deal of feathers, and not with that cotton which the willows and other plants furnish the penduline titmouse.</P>
<P>The long-tail titmouse lays ten or fourteen eggs, and even as many as twenty, concealed almost entirely beneath the feathers collected in the bottom of the nest; these eggs are of the size of a hazel nut, their greatest diameter being six lines; they are surrounded by a reddish zone
<PB N="435" REF="471"/>
on a gray ground, which grows more dilute at the thick end.</P>
<P>The young continue with the parents through the whole winter, and hence the small flocks of twelve or fifteen seen during that season. They utter a small shrill cry, only as a call; but in the spring they acquire a new modula∣tion, which makes it much more pleasant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It sings so pleasantly in the spring," says Belon, "that scarce any bird has a voice so lofty and airy." Gesner asserts that, in this season, the long-tailed titmouse utters <HI>guickeg, guickeg:</HI> this seems not to be the <HI>pleasant song</HI> which Belon mentions. Others say that this titmouse has a feeble voice, and a little shrill cry, <HI>ti, ti, ti, ti;</HI> but this is certainly not the warble heard in spring.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Aristotle assures us, that these birds prefer the mountains. Belon says, that he observed them in all countries; and Belon had travelled: he adds, that they seldom leave the woods to visit the gardens. Willughby informs us, that in England they frequent the gardens more than the mountains: Hebert asserts the same, but re∣stricts it to the winter season. According to Gesner, they appear during cold weather only, and haunt the marshes; whence their name <HI>reed titmice.</HI> Daubenton, the younger, has seen flights of them in the king's garden, about the end of December; and has informed
<PB N="436" REF="472"/>
me, that they are frequent in the woods of Bou∣logne. Lastly, some maintain that they conti∣nue through the winter; others, that they mi∣grate; and others, that they arrive later than the other titmice, and have therefore been called <HI>snow titmice.</HI> These opposite statements may be reconciled, by supposing, what is at the same time very probable, that these birds vary their range according to circumstances; that they remain when their situation is com∣fortable, and change when they want a better; that they inhabit the mountain or the vale, the bank or the marsh, the forest or the vineyard, or wherever they can enjoy convenience and subsistence. They are seldom caught in traps, and their flesh is unpleasant food.</P>
<P>Their feathers are loose, and resemble a very long down: they have a sort of black eyebrows, and the upper eyelids of an orange yellow, but this colour is hardly visible in dried subjects; the upper side of the head, the throat, and all the under side of the body, white, shaded with blackish on the breast, and sometimes tinged with red on the belly, the loins, and under the tail: the back of the neck is black, whence rises a bar of the same colour, which stretches through the whole of the upper part of the body between two broad bars of bastard red;
<PB N="437" REF="473"/>
the tail black, edged with white; the fore part of the wing black and white; the great quills blackish; so are the middle ones, but edged with white, except those next the body, which are of the same rufous with the black; the ground of the feathers deep cinereous; the iris gray; the bill black, but gray at the point; and the legs blackish.</P>
<P>The white bar on the crown of the head spreads more or less, and sometimes incroaches so much on the lateral black bars, that the head appears entirely white. In some subjects, the under side of the body is all white; such were those seen by Belon, and some that I have observed myself. In females, the lateral bars of the head are only blackish, or even varie∣gated with black and white, and the colours of the plumage are not well defined or contrasted. The bird is hardly larger than the gold-crested wren; it weighs about one hundred and four∣teen grains. As its feathers are almost always bristled, it appears rather thicker than in reality.</P>
<P>Total length, five inches and two-thirds; the bill, three lines and a half, thicker than that of the blue titmouse, the upper mandible a little hooked; the tongue rather broader than in that bird, and terminated with filaments; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> seven lines and a half; the hind nail the

<P>This bird resembles those preceding, parti∣cularly the long-tailed titmouse, in the manner it constructs its nest; which it places in the thickest bushes, but not at the extremity of the branches, as some naturalists have supposed. The cock assists the hen in building; he strikes his wings forcibly against the sides of the nest, and compacts it into the form of an elongated ball; the aperture is in the side; the eggs in the centre, where they are safest and warmest.

It is seldom caught in traps; and, if surprised, it will refuse food, and, spurning every soothing attention, will expire in confinement. Hence it is little known: we learn only that, in its congenial solitude, it feeds upon the insects which it catches as they fly about the trees; and that it has the chief character of the titmice, great fe∣cundity.</P>

In the ordinary course of nature the affirmative is the most probable, though it may indeed be modified by climate, and peculiar instincts.</P>
<P>Their plumage is entirely of a slaty black, which appears equally on the upper and under side of the body, and the uniformity- of which is only interrupted by a bar divided by yellow and rufous, placed longitudinally on the wing, and formed by the exterior border of some of the middle quills: this bar has three indent∣ings, at its origin, near the middle of the wing, which consists of fifteen or sixteen quills dif∣fering little in length.</P>
<P>The amorous titmouse weighs three gros: it is of the same shape with the other titmice, and of a middle size; but its tail is shorter, and only five inches and a quarter; the bill eight lines,
<PB N="456" REF="492"/>
black at the base, and bright orange at the oppo∣site extremity; the upper mandible exceeding a little the lower, and having its edges sliightly in∣dented near the tip; the tongue somewhat trun∣cated at the end, as in the other titmice; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> eight lines; the mid toe the longest, ad∣hering by its first phalanx to the outer toe; the nails forming a semi-circle by their curvature, the hind one strongest; the alar extent, seven inches and an half; the tail near two inches, a little forked, consisting of twelve quills: it ex∣ceeds the wings more than an inch. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Parus Amatorius:</HI> "It is ringed with slate colour; a longitudinal spot on the wings, divided by yellow and rufous."</NOTE></P>

<P>Most of the names which the moderns have imposed on this bird, convey false or incomplete ideas: such are the <HI>May Woodpecker, Blue Woodpecker, Mason Woodpecker, Nutcracker, Creeper, Wagtail,</HI> &amp;c. This bird strikes with its bill on the bark of trees with more force and noise than even the woodpeckers and titmice, and it has much of the air and aspect of the latter: but it is distinguished from the titmice by the form of its bill, and from the woodpeckers by the form of its tail, its feet, and its tongue. It is discrimi∣nated from the creepers by its bill and its habit of cracking nuts; and from the nutcrackers again by its habit of creeping upon trees: it has an alternate motion of the tail upwards and downwards, like the wagtails, but its oeconomy is en∣tirely different.</P></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THE nuthatch seldom migrates from one country to another; it constantly re∣sides where it is bred, only in winter it seeks warm aspects, approaches the dwellings, and even visits sometimes the vineyards and the gardens. Perhaps it finds shelter in the same holes where it collects its stores, and probably passes the night; for, when kept in confine∣ment,
<PB REF="495"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE EUROPEAN NUTHATCH.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="459" REF="496"/>
though it sometimes perches on the bars of the cage, it seeks holes to sleep in, and, if unsuccessful, will repose even in the drawer. It seldom squats in the natural position, or with its head erect; it is commonly awry, or even hanging downwards; in this situation it bores the nuts, after fixing them firm in a chink <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>. It trips on the trees in all directions to catch in∣sects. Aristotle says, that it habitually breaks the eagle's eggs; and indeed, if it could climb to the lofty eyries of the king of birds, it might pierce and eat the eggs, which are not so
<PB N="460" REF="497"/>
hard as nuts. But it is idle to assert, that this is what provokes the vengeance of the eagle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 1. Perhaps the <HI>clamitoria</HI> or <HI>pro∣hibitoria</HI> of Pliny is the same bird: the name <HI>prohibitoria</HI> might allude to the ancient fables, with regard to the nut∣hatch, and to its use in necromancy. See <HI>Nat. Hist.</HI> lib. x. 14.</NOTE>, as if a bird of prey needs instigation to plunder and devour weaker birds.</P>
<P>Though the nuthatch spends a great part of its time in climbing or creeping upon trees, its motions are quicker and nimbler than those of the sparrow; they are also smoother and more connected, for it makes less noise in flying. It commonly lives in the woods, in the most soli∣tary manner; yet if confined in a volery with other birds, sparrows, for instance, or finches, it will continue on good terms with them.</P>
<P>In spring, the male has a song, or love-call, <HI>guiric, guiric,</HI> often repeated. The female is long invited, it is said, before she will yield to the solicitations; but, when the union is ac∣complished, both in concert labour in forming their nest. They fix it in the hole of a tree <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"> Sometimes in the hole of a wall or of a roof, says Linnaeus.</NOTE>; and when they cannot find one that suits them, they make an excavation with their bills, if the wood be worm-eaten: if the external aperture
<PB N="461" REF="498"/>
be too large, they contract it with fat earth, and sometimes with dirt, which they mould and fashion, it is said, as a potter would do his clay, and they strengthen it with small stones; and hence are derived the names <HI>mason-woodpecker</HI> and <HI>wipe-pot</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Torche-pot:</HI> this word comes from <HI>torche-poteux,</HI> which signifies <HI>wipe-hole.</HI></NOTE>. From the appearance of the outside of the nest, we could hardly suppose it lodged birds.</P>
<P>The hen lays five, six, or seven eggs of the ordinary shape, of a dirty white ground, and dotted with rusty; the bed is wood dust, moss, &amp;c. She hatches assiduously; and so ardent is her attachment that she will suffer the feathers to be torn, rather than quit the nest. If it be rummaged with a stick, she bristles with rage, and hisses like a serpent, or rather like a tit∣mouse in the same situation. Nor does she leave her eggs to seek food, but patiently expects the return of the male, who affectionately brings supply. They do not live altogether on ants, like the woodpeckers, but on caterpillars, beetles, gadflies, and all sorts of insects, and the various kinds of nuts <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I fed a female six weeks with hemp-seed which other birds had dropped bruised. It has indeed been remarked, that the nuthatch visits the hemp-fields about the month of September.</NOTE>. The flesh of the young ones
<PB N="462" REF="499"/>
accordingly, when they are fat, is excellent, and has not the wild taste of the wood-peckers.</P>
<P>The incubation is completed in May <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I saw some nestlings by the 10th, and I saw some eggs not hatched by the 15th.</NOTE>; and after the young are reared, the parents seldom begin a second hatch, but dissolve their union, and live separate during the winter. "The peasants have observed," says Belon, "that the cock beats the hen whenever he finds her after parting; and hence it is become a proverb, that a person who keeps his wife in due order is like a nuthatch." But the conduct of the hus∣band has no concern, I am confident, in the pre∣sent case: the female, as she is the last to pair, is probably the first in separating; and when the male meets her after a long absence, he loads her with caresses, and gives vent to rap∣turous endearments, which inaccurate observers may mistake for harsh usage.</P>
<P>The nuthatch is silent through the greatest part of the year; its ordinary cry <HI>ti, ti, ti, ti, ti, ti, ti,</HI> which it repeats as it scrambles round the trees, and quickens the measure more and more. Linnaeus asserts from the testimony of Strom, that it cries also during the night.</P>
<P>Besides the different cries and the noise which
<PB N="463" REF="500"/>
it makes in beating on the bark, the nuthatch, inserting its bill in a chink, makes another very singular sound, as if the tree were split in two, and which may be heard more than two hundred yards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>British Zoology.</HI> Besides their <HI>toc, toc, toc,</HI> against the wood, these birds rub their bill upon the dry and hollow branches, and make a noise <HI>grrrrrro,</HI> which is heard at a very great distance, and might be imagined to proceed from a bird twenty times as large: this I have been assured by an old gamekeeper, who most assuredly had never read the British Zoology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This bird has been observed to hop; to sleep with its head under its wing; to spend the night on the floor of its cage, though there were two roosts where it might have perched. It it said not to frequent springs, and therefore cannot be ensnared by placing limed twigs near these. Schwenckfeld relates that it is often caught by using tallow alone for the bait: and this is ano∣ther feature of resemblance to the titmice, which, as we have seen, are fond of all fat substances.</P>

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the NUTHATCH.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of this genus of birds seems little affected by the influence of various cli∣mates. Its oeconomy and natural habits are ever the same: the upper part always ash gray, the lower stained with rufous, more or less dilute, and sometimes whitish. The chief dif∣ference consists in the size and proportions, and this does not constantly result from climate. After attentively comparing the foreign Nut∣hatches with the European kinds, I am con∣vinced that they are varieties of the same species. I except one only, which differs in many re∣spects; and, from the little curvature of its bill, seems to form the shade between the nut∣hatches and the creepers.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="466" REF="503"/>
I. THE LITTLE NUTHATCH <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sitta Minor, <HI>Briss.</HI></NOTE>. I must borrow this variety from Belon. According to him, it is much smaller than the common nut∣hatch: its plumage, its bill, and its feet are the same. It lives in the woods like the large sort, and is equally solitary. "It is more noisy, joyous and roving," says Belon; "the male is never seen with other company but its female; and if it meets with any other of the species (he means a male), it attacks it, teases it, and contends obstinately till his rival gives way; then cries shrill and with all his vigour, inviting his female, and demanding the prize attached to his victory." To such cases, perhaps, Belon alluded, when he asserted that the voice was louder than that of the ordinary nuthatch.</P>

<HEAD>THE CREEPERS. Les Grimpereaux, <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have already treated of several creep∣ing birds, the nuthatches and titmice: we shall see others in the sequel, such as the woodpeckers; but the appellation of <HI>creepers</HI> is appropriated to the genus which we are now to consider. They creep very nimbly on trees, both in ascending and descending; both on the upper and the under side of the branches: they run swiftly along beams, clasping the edge with their little feet. They are distinguished from the woodpeckers by their bill and tongue; and from the titmice by the greater length of their bill; and from the nuthatches by its more slen∣der and hooked form; and accordingly they do not strike the bark with it, like these other birds.</P>
<P>Many foreign species of creepers resemble much the humming birds; by their diminutive size, by the rich colours of their plumage, by their slender incurvated bill, only it is of a more lengthened and sharper form, while that of the
<PB N="474" REF="511"/>
humming bird is of an equal thickness through∣out, or even slightly inflated at the tip: the legs of the creepers are shorter, their wings longer, and their tail contains twelve quills, though that of the humming birds has only ten: and, lastly, the tongue of the creepers is not, like that of the humming birds, composed of two cylindri∣cal half tubes, which, joined together, form an entire tube, and is properly an organ of respi∣ration, and more analogous to the feeler of an insect than the tongue of a bird.</P>
<P>The genus of creepers is also spread through a wider extent than that of the humming birds. These seem peculiar to the continent of Ame∣rica, and seldom venture farther than the southern parts of Canada; and at that latitude the breadth of the ocean is too vast to be tra∣versed by a little insect-bird. But the creeper of Europe penetrating to Denmark, or even beyond, those of Asia and America probably advanced also to the north, so that an easy com∣munication might be found from one continent to the other.</P>
<P>As the creepers live upon the same insects with the woodpeckers, the nuthatches, and the titmice, and cannot, from the defect of their bill, extract the insects lodged under the bark, they follow those birds, which they make their
<PB N="475" REF="512"/>
providers, and dexterously snatch the little prey. And since insects are their sole subsist∣ence, we may readily suppose that the species are more prolific and varied in hot climates, where such provision abounds, than in cold or temperate climates, which are less favourable to the multiplication of insects. This is an ob∣servation of Sonnerat, and it corresponds to facts.</P>
<P>It is a general remark, that the plumage of young birds is not so bright as that of adults; but the difference is more striking in the bril∣liant tribes of the creepers, the humming birds, and other small birds that inhabit the immense forests of America. Bajon informs us, that the colours of these are formed very gradually, and do not assume their lustre till after a number of moultings. He adds, that the females are smaller than the males, and inferior in beauty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Memoires pour servir à l'Histoire de Cayenne,</HI> p. 257.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever analogy subsists between the creep∣ers of the old and of the new continent, they are yet distinct; and I have no doubt but, in time, more important differences will be found both in their exterior appearance and in their natu∣ral habits <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Senegal, according to Adanson, there are many species of birds, of which the females are as brilliant as the males.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>LITTLE animals are commonly the most agile. The creeper is nearly as small as the crowned wren, and accordingly is perpetually in motion: but the scene of its activity is ex∣tremely limited; it never migrates, and its or∣dinary abode is the hole of a tree. From this it emerges in pursuit of the insects harboured in the bark and the moss; and there the female breeds and hatches <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Frisch says, that it defends itself stoutly against the nuthatch, when invaded.</NOTE>. Belon asserts, and almost all the naturalists have repeated it, that the creeper has about twenty eggs; but he certainly confounded it with the titmice. For my own
<PB N="477" REF="514"/>
part, I am confident, both from my own ob∣servations and those of many naturalists <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salerne, Lottinger, Ginnani.</NOTE>, that the hen generally lays only five eggs, and sel∣dom or never above seven: they are cinereous, with points and streaks of a deeper colour, and the shell is pretty hard. It is observed that the hatch is begun early in the spring, which is very probable, since the bird is neither obliged to construct its nest nor to migrate.</P>
<P>Frisch asserts, that they search for insects on walls; but since he was not acquainted with the real wall-creeper, and did not recognize it in Gesner's description, though distinctly cha∣racterised, he probably confounded here the two species, especially as the common creeper is recluse, and lives chiefly in the woods. One was brought to me in the month of January 1773, which had been shot on an acacia in the king's garden; but it was regarded as a cu∣riosity, and the people who worked there the whole year told me that they very seldom saw these birds. Nor are they common in Bur∣gundy or Italy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gerini.</NOTE>, though frequent in England <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>: they are found also in Germany, and as far as
<PB N="478" REF="515"/>
Denmark, as I have already remarked. They have a weak cry, which is very shrill and very common. They generally weigh five drachms English, and appear larger than they really are, because their feathers are not laid regularly upon one another, but bristled and disordered, and they are also very long.</P>
<P>The throat of the creeper is pure white, but ge∣nerally assumes a rustytint, which is always deeper on the flanks and the remote parts (sometimes all the under side of the body is white), the upper side variegated with rufous, with white, and with blackish; and these colours vary in their bright∣ness and intensity: the head is of a darker cast; the ring about the eyes, and the eyebrows, white; the rump rufous; the quills of the wings brown, the three first edged with gray, the fourteen following marked with a whitish spot, which forms on the wing a transverse bar of the same colour; the three last marked near the tip with a black spot between two white ones: the bill is brown above, and whitish below; the legs gray; the ground of the feathers deep ci∣nereous.</P>
<P>Total length, five inches; the bill, eight lines, slender, hooked, contracting gradually, and terminating in a point: the throat is wide, says Belon; the nostrils very oblong, half co∣vered

<P>ALL the motions that the preceding per∣forms on trees, this performs on walls; it lodges there, and there it climbs, hunts, and breeds: by walls, I mean not only those built by man, but those formed by nature, the huge perpendicular rocks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Turin it is called the <HI>mountain woodpecker;</HI> and Schwenckfeld says, that it is commonly seen in citadels built on mountains.</NOTE>. Kramer remarks, that these birds prefer the haunts of the tombs, and deposit their eggs in human sculls. They fly flapping their wings like the lapwing; and, though they are larger than the common creepers, they are equally lively and active.
<PB N="482" REF="521"/>
Flies, ants, and particularly spiders, are their usual food.</P>
<P>Belon supposed this species peculiar to Au∣vergne; but it occurs in Austria, Silesia, Switzer∣land, Poland, Lorraine, and particularly the part bordering on Germany, and even in England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards thinks, with Ray and Willughby, that it never visits England, at least he never saw it there.</NOTE>, according to some, though others regard it as at least very rare. On the contrary, it is com∣mon in Italy, near Bologna and Florence; but much less frequent in Piedmont.</P>
<P>It is chiefly in winter that these birds appear near dwellings; and if we believe Belon, they are heard flying at a great distance in the air, descending from the mountains to lodge on the walls of cities. They keep single, or at least by two and two, like most birds that feed on insects, and though solitary, they are neither weary nor melancholy: so certain it is, that cheerfulness depends more on the original dis∣position than on the enlivening influence of society!</P>
<P>In the male, there is a black mark under the throat, which extends to the fore part of the neck, and distinguishes the sex: the upper side of the head and body is of a pleasant ash co∣lour,
<PB N="483" REF="522"/>
the under side of a deeper cast; the small superior coverts of the wings, rose co∣lour; the great ones blackish edged with rose colour; the quills terminated with white, and bordered from their base to the middle with rose colour, which grows more dilute, and almost vanishes on the quills nearest the body; the five first marked on the inside with two spots of white more or less pure, and the nine following with a single fulvous spot; the small inferior coverts next the margin rose coloured, the others blackish; the quills of the tail blackish, the four mid ones tipt with dirty gray, and the two outer pairs with white; the bill and legs black.</P>
<P>In the female, the throat is whitish. A subject which I observed had, under its throat, a broad mark of light gray, which descended on the neck, and sent off a branch to each side of the head. The female described by Edwards was larger than the male described by Brisson. In general, this bird is of a size between that of the blackbird and of the sparrow.</P>
<P>Total length, six inches and two-thirds; the bill, fourteen lines; and sometimes twenty, ac∣cording to Brisson; the tongue very pointed, broader at the base, terminated by two appen∣dices; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> ten or twelve lines; the toes
<PB N="484" REF="523"/>
disposed three before and one behind; the mid one nine or ten lines, the hind one eleven; and the chord of the arc formed by the nail alone is six lines; in general all the nails are long, nar∣row, and hooked; the alar extent, ten lines; the wings consist of twenty quills, according to Edwards, and of nineteen, according to Brisson; and both include the first, which is very short, and ought not to be reckoned a quill; the tail twenty-one lines, consisting of twelve quills nearly equal; it exceeds the wings six or seven lines.</P>
<P>Belon positively asserts, that this bird has two toes before and two behind; but he also says, that the tail of the common creeper is short. The source of both errors is the same: that natu∣ralist considered these birds as related to the woodpeckers, and he ascribed those characters without examining narrowly. Analogy, which so often conducts to great discoveries, frequent∣ly misleads in the detail of observation. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Wall-creeper, <HI>Certhia Muraria:</HI> "It is cinereous, with a fulvous spot on the wings."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS OF THE ANCIENT CONTINENT, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE CREEPERS.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL term these birds <HI>Soui-mangas,</HI> the name which they receive in Madagascar. After these, I shall range the birds of the new continent, which bear some analogy to the creepers, but whose habits and oeconomy are very different; and I shall prefer the Indian ap∣pellation <HI>guit-guit,</HI> as more expressive than any abstract artificial term. In general the creepers, and soui-mangas, have their bill proportionally longer than the guit-guits, and their plumage at least as beautiful, and even equal to that of the most brilliant of the humming birds. The co∣lours are the softest, the richest, the most daz∣zling; all the tints of green, of blue, of orange, of red, of purple, heightened by the contrast of various shades of brown and glossy black. We cannot enough admire the glow of these colours, their sparkling lustre, their endless variety, even in the dried specimens which decorate our cabi∣nets. Nature would seem to have formed the feathers of precious stones; of the ruby, of the emerald, the amethyst, and the topaz. How enchanting, could we view the birds themselves!
<PB N="486" REF="525"/>
their plumage in all its freshness, animated by the breath of life, embellished by all that dazzles in the magic of the prism, changing its re∣flections with each quick movement, and dart∣ing new colours or new flames. To study na∣ture in her minute, as in her grand productions, we ought to contemplate her in the state of freedom, before the hand of man has interfered.</P>
<P>There are many foui-mangas living with the Dutch bird-catchers at the Cape of Good Hope: the only food offered is sugared water: the flies, which abound in that climate and torment Dutch cleanliness, supply the rest. These birds are alert in seizing them, and none escape that enter their volery. This additional food seems necessary to their support: for they soon die on board ships, where there are fewer in∣fects. The Viscount Querhoënt, to whom we are indebted for these remarks, could never keep them alive above three weeks.</P>

<P>THE head, the throat, and all the anterior part, are of a fine brilliant green, with a double collar of violet and chesnut: but these colours are not uniform or permanent: the light which plays among the webs of the feathers changes incessantly its shades, from gold green to deep blue: on each side, below the shoulder, there is a spot of fine yellow: the breast is brown; the rest of the under side of the body, faint yellow; the rest of the upper side of the body, dusky olive; the great coverts and quills of the wings brown, edged with olive; those of the tail black, edged with green, except the outermost, which is partly brown gray: the following one is ter∣minated with the same colour: the bill and legs are black.</P>
<P>The female is rather smaller, and much infe∣rior in beauty: it is olive brown above, olive bordering on yellow below; in other respects similar to the male, but inferior in lustre. It is nearly the size of the common wren.</P>

We may however distinguish four that are more constant; the lower blackish violet, the next chesnut, then brown, and lastly yellow: there are two spots of yellow below the shoulders: the rest of the under side of the body is olive gray; the upper side deep green, with reflec∣tions of blue, violet, &amp;c. and the quills of the wings, the quills and coverts of the tail, are brown of various intensity, with a greenish gloss.</P>

<P>THIS species, which comes from the Cape of Good Hope, bears some analogy to that of the violet soui-manga: its head is likewise of a gold green, waving with rose copper; and this gold green extends over the throat, the head, and all the upper side of the body; it borders also the intermediate quills of the tail,
<PB N="495" REF="534"/>
which are of a glossy black; only it is not changeable on the superior coverts. The breast is marked with red, as in the violet soui-manga, only confined to a narrower space, and not raised so high, and forming a sort of cincture whose upper edge is contiguous to the collar of blue steel colour, waving with green, and about a line in breadth: the rest of the un∣der side of the body is gray, with some yel∣low speckles on the top of the belly, and on the flanks: the quills of the wings are of a brown gray: the bill is blackish, and the legs entirely black. The bird is nearly of the size of the violet soui-manga, but differently pro∣portioned.</P>
<P>Total length, four inches and a half; the bill, ten lines; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> eight lines and a half; the mid toe six lines, and nearly equal to the hind toe; the alar extent, six inches and a half; the tail eighteen lines, consisting of twelve equal quills, and exceeding the wings nine lines.</P>
<P>The female, according to Brisson, differs from the male, the under side of its body being of the same colour with the upper side, only there are yellow speckles on the flanks: according to others, it has also a red cincture, but which falls lower than in the male, and all its other colours
<PB N="496" REF="535"/>
are fainter: admitting this, we may regard as the female the soui-manga observed at the Cape of Good Hope, by the Viscount Quer∣hoënt, in January 1774. In that bird the throat was brown gray, variegated with green and blue; the breast decorated with a flame-coloured cincture; the rest of the under side of the body, white gray; the head and all the upper side of the body brown gray, variegated with green on the back, and with blue at the origin of the tail; the wings light brown, with a coat of gold yellow; the quills of the tail, blackish; the bill and legs, black. The Vis∣count subjoins, that this bird sings prettily; that it lives on insects and the juices of flowers; but that its throat is so narrow that it cannot swallow the larger common flies. Is it not then probable that this was a young bird, and that the true female of the soui-manga is the same with Brisson's creeper from the Cape of Good Hope <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certhia Capensis, <HI>Linn.</HI> edit. xiii.</NOTE>, which is uniformly of a brown gray, deeper above and lighter below, the colour which borders the tail and the wings? Their dimen∣sions also correspond, and both are brought from the African promontory; but time and ob∣servation will ascertain the point.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="536"/>
Lastly, we may reckon, as a female of this species, or as one of its varieties, the Philippine creepr of Brisson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certhia Philippina, <HI>Linn.</HI> edit. xiii. (See art. iii. the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote.) I know not on what foundation Linnaeus gives to his species two long quills in the middle of the tail: if he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w an individual so formed, it must have been a young <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or an old one in moult, or a female.

Adanson suspects that the bird which Brisson considers as the hen angala is only a young one of the same species before its first moulting. "This seems to appear," he subjoins, "from the number of birds of this kind, and very simi∣lar to it, which are found at Senegal, and of which the females are exactly like the males: but the young ones have a great intermixture of gray, which they lose not till they drop their feathers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I doubt not that M. Adanson saw at Senegal numbers of females like their males, since he avers it; but we must not thence draw any general rule for all the birds of Africa and of Asia: the gold pheasant of China, the peacock, many species of turtles, of shrikes, of parrakeets, &amp;c. found in Africa, are proofs to the contrary.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The angala is almost as large as the epicurean warbler: it gives its nest the shape of a cup, like the canary and chaffinch, and scarcely uses any other materials than the down of plants. It lays generally five or six eggs: but it is often driven from its hatch by a sort of large vora∣cious spider, which seizes the brood, and sucks the blood <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Supplement de l'Encyclopedie, au mot <HI>Angala.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bird which Brisson regards as a female, and Adanson as a young one, is of a dirty white,

<P>OUR knowledge of this bird is very scanty: it comes from Ceylon: its plumage is green, tinged with all the rich colours, among which that of gold seems to predominate.

<P>WE are acquainted with only three birds in the ancient continent to which this epithet belongs. Seba mentions also a female of that kind, which had not the long tail; whence it would appear that, in some species at least, this is the attribute of the male. And might not several males already described have attained the same character at the proper age or season? Many subjects which have been fi∣gured and engraved, are perhaps only females, or young males, or even old ones in moult, when this decoration is lost. For there is no differ∣ence between the conformation of the long∣tailed soui-mangas and the short-tailed ones; and their plumage glows with the same colours.</P>

<P>I SEE no reason why this bird should have been called the little creeper, unless that the two middle quills of the tail are not so long as in the two others; but, if we overlook the tail, this will be found not the smallest of the three.

<P>THIS bird inhabits the Cape of Good Hope, where it was observed and kept several weeks by the Viscount Querhoënt, who describes it in the following terms: "It is of the size of the linnet; its bill, which is a little incurvated, is
<PB N="513" REF="552"/>
fourteen lines long; it is black, and also the feet, which are furnished with long nails, particu∣larly the middle and hinder ones: the eyes are black; the upper and under sides of the body, of a very fine brilliant green (glossed with rose copper, Brisson adds), with some feathers of gold yellow under the wings; the great fea∣thers of the wings and of the tail, of a fine black, glossed with violet; the filament of the tail, which is rather more than three inches, is edged with green." Brisson adds, that on each side, between the bill and the eye, there is a streak of velvet black.</P>
<P>In this species the female has also a long tail, or rather a long filament at its tail, but which is shorter, however, than in the male, for it projects only two inches and a few lines beyond the lateral quills: the upper side of the body and of the head greenish brown, mixed with some feathers of a fine green; the rump green; the great quills of the wings and of the tail almost black, and also the filament or two intermediate quills: the under side of the body is yellowish, with some green feathers on the breast. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Certhia Famosa:</HI> "The we middle quills of its tail are very long; its body of a lossy green, yellow under its pinions, the straps black."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS and the three following have been reckoned American birds, and would therefore range with the guit-guits; but as from their conformation, and particularly the length of their bill, they are more related to the soui∣mangas, we have placed them between the two tribes. We adopt this plan the more rea∣dily, as the climate of these birds rests solely upon the authority of Seba, which naturalists know has little weight, and ever insufficient to balance against the force of analogy. We shall not, however, hurt the received prejudices by changing the name; though that of soui∣manga would suit them better.</P>
<P>Red is the prevailing colour in the plumage of this bird, but it has different shades; for the crown of the head is lighter and more brilliant, and that on the rest of the body is deeper. There are some exceptions, however: for the throat
<PB N="515" REF="554"/>
and the fore part of the neck are green; the quills of the tail and of the wings are terminated with blueish; the thighs, the bill, and the legs, of a light yellow.</P>
<P>Its voice is said to be pleasant. It is a little larger than our creeper.</P>
<P>Total length, about four inches and a half; the bill, ten lines; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> six lines; the mid toe five lines, rather longer than the hind one; the tail fourteen lines, consisting of twelve equal quills, and projecting about seven lines beyond the wings.</P>
<P>I consider as a variety of this species the black-headed red bird, which Seba and some others after him have referred to New Spain. Its proportions are exactly like those of the preceding: the only apparent difference is in the length of the bill, which is ten lines in the pre∣ceding, and only seven in this, which would occasion a difference in the total length. But these measures are taken from the figure, and therefore liable to error; especially as the original observer, Seba, seems more struck with its long bill than with that of the other. It is very probable that the designer or engraver took the liberty of shortening it; and an alteration of three or four lines would bring the two birds to an almost perfect identity. There are some
<PB N="516" REF="555"/>
differences in the plumage, which alone in∣duced me to distinguish it as a variety.</P>
<P>Its head is of a fine black, and the superior coverts of the wings, gold yellow; all the rest is light red, except the quills of the tail and wings, which are of a deeper shade.

<HEAD>THE AMERICAN GUIT-GUITS.</HEAD>
<P>GUIT-GUIT is an American name, ap∣plied to one or two of this tribe, con∣taining the creepers of the New Continent: I shall use it as a generic appellation. I have al∣ready noticed some differences that obtain be∣tween them and the humming birds: I may add that they neither fly in the same manner, nor sip the nectar of flowers. Yet the creoles at Cayenne frequently confound them; and we should be therefore aware of this circum∣stance in reading the relations of travellers.</P>
<P>I am assured that the guit-guits of Cayenne never climb upon trees; that they live in flocks with those of their own kind, and also with other birds, such as the little tanagres, nut∣hatches, picucullas, &amp;c. and that they feed not only upon insects, but upon fruits and even buds.</P>

<P>THE face of this beautiful bird is of a bril∣liant sea green: there is a bar on the eyes of vel∣vet black; the rest of the head, the throat, and all the under part of the body (without excep∣tion, according to Edwards), the lower part of the back, and the superior coverts of the tail, of an ultramarine blue, which is the only colour that appears when the feathers are regularly disposed, though each has three colours, accord∣ing to the remark of Brisson, brown at the base, green in the middle, and blue at the ex∣tremity; the top of the back, the part of the neck contiguous to the back, and the tail, velvet black: what appears of the wings, when they are closed, is of the same black, except a blue bar, which crosses their coverts obliquely: the inner side of the quills of the wings, and their inserior coverts, are of a fine yellow: so that the wings, which seem entirely black when at
<PB N="521" REF="560"/>
rest, appear variegated with black and yellow when displayed, or in motion. The inferior coverts of the tail are of a dull black (and not blue, as Brisson represents): the bill is black, and the legs sometimes red, sometimes orange, sometimes yellow, and occasionally whitish.</P>
<P>It appears from this description, that the co∣lours of the plumage are subject to vary in dif∣ferent specimens: in some, the throat is mixed with brown; in others it is black. In general, the distribution of the black seems the most ir∣regular: the blue assumes sometimes a violet tinge.</P>
<P>Marcgrave observed, that the eyes are black; that the tongue is terminated by many fila∣ments; that the feathers on the back are silky; and that the bird is nearly as large as the chaf∣finch. He saw it in Brazil; but it occurs also in Guiana and Cayenne. In the female the wings have a coat of yellowish gray.</P>
<P>Total length, four inches and a quarter; the bill, eight or nine lines; the <HI>tarsus,</HI> six or se∣ven; the mid toe six, and a very little longer than the hind toe; the alar extent, six inches and three quarters; the tail fifteen lines, con∣sisting of twelve equal quills, and exceeding the wings three or four lines. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Certhia Cyanea:</HI> "It is sky blue; a bar on the eyes; the shoulders, the wings, and the tail, black; its legs brown."</NOTE></P>

<P>THIS variety is found in Cayenne: it dif∣fers from the preceding only in the shades of the plumage: the head is of a fine blue: there is a bar on the eyes of a velvet black: the throat, the wings, and the tail, are of the same black: all the rest is of a shining blue, verging upon violet; the bill black, and the legs yellow: the blue feathers which cover the body, are of three colours, the same as in the preceding.</P>
<P>With regard to size, it is rather smaller, and the tail especially appears shorter; which would imply that it is either a young bird, or an adult that has not recovered from moulting; but the alar extent is greater, which precludes this sup∣position.</P>
<P>It constructs its nest with much art: the out∣side consists of coarse straw, and stiff stalks of herbs; the inside of softer materials: the shape resembles that of a retort: it is suspended from
<PB N="523" REF="562"/>
the end of a pliant branch, and the aperture faces the ground. The bird enters the neck, and creeps into the belly of the retort, which is its proper nest. By this contrivance, the hatch is guarded against the visits of spiders, lizards, and other intruders. Wherever weak animals subsist, unprotected by man, we may infer that they are industrious.</P>

<P>The All-Green Creeper, <HI>Edw. &amp; Lath.</HI></P></NOTE> All the under side of the body is deep green, tinged with blueish, except the rump, which, as well as the throat, and the under side of the body, is of a lighter green, tinged with yellowish: the brown of the wings is here black: the bill and legs are blackish; but there is a little flesh co∣lour near the base of the lower mandible.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Cayenne, and in Spa∣nish America: it is of the same size with the preceding, and nearly the same proportions, ex∣cept that the bill is rather shorter, and more similar to that of the sugar-birds.</P>

<P>NATURE seems to have taken pleasure in decorating the plumage of this bird with va∣riety and choice of colours: bright red on the top of the head; fine blue on the back of the head; blue and white on the cheeks; two shades of yellow on the throat, the breast, and all the under side of the body; yellow, blue, white, blackish, on the upper side of the body, including the wings, the tail, and their superior

<P>ITS ordinary food is the sweet viscous juice of the sugar cane, which it sucks through the cracks of the stalk: so I have been informed by a traveller who resided many years at Cayenne. In this respect it resembles the humming birds; it is also exceedingly small; and from the rela∣tive length of its wings, it approaches that of Cayenne, though it differs by the length of its legs and the shortness of its tail. I suspect that the sugar-birds likewise eat insects, though this has not been mentioned.</P>
<P>In a male from Jamaica, the throat, the neck, and the upper side of the head and body, were of a fine black, but with some exceptions; for there were white eyebrows, traces of white on the great quills of the wings, from their ori∣gin to more than half their length, and also on
<PB N="533" REF="572"/>
the tips of all the lateral quills of the tail; the edge of the wings, the rump, the flanks and the belly, of a fine yellow, which spreads and grows dilute on the lower belly, and becomes whitish on the inferior coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>The species is diffused through Martinico, Cayenne, and St. Domingo, &amp;c. but the plum∣age varies a little in these different islands, though nearly in the same parallel. In the sugar-bird of Cayenne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The negroes and creoles of St. Domingo call it <HI>Sicouri.</HI></NOTE>, the head is blackish; there are two white eyebrows, which extending meet behind the neck: the throat is light ash gray; the back and the superior coverts of the wings of a deeper ash gray; the quills of the wings and of the tail ash gray, bordered with cinereous; the anterior part of the wings bor∣dered with lemon yellow; the rump yellow; the breast and the under side of the body also yellow; but this colour is mixed with gray on the lower belly: the bill is black, and the legs blueish: the tail projects a very little beyond the wings.</P>
<P>This bird has a very delicate note, <HI>zi, zi,</HI> and, like the humming bird, also sucks the juice of plants. Though I have been strongly assured that the one which I have described is a male,
<PB N="534" REF="573"/>
I must own that it bears great resemblance to the female from Jamaica <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Certhia Flaveola, var. 1. <HI>Linn. &amp; Gmel.</HI></P>
<P>Certhia Martinicana, seu Saccharivora, <HI>Briss.</HI></P>
<P>The Yellow-bellied Creeper, <HI>Edw.</HI></P></NOTE>, only this has a whitish throat, and a cinereous cast where the other was blackish; the eyelids yellowish white; the anterior part of the wings edged with white, and the rump of the same colour with the back; the five pairs of lateral feathers of the tail terminated with white, according to Edwards; the single exterior pair, according to Brisson: lastly, the greatest quills of the wings white, from their origin more than half their length, as in the male.</P>
<P>Sloane says, that this bird has a very short but pleasant warble; but that was probably the female, and the male would still have a sweeter air. The same observer, who diffected one of these birds, tells us that the throat and gizzard were small, the latter not muscular, and lined by an inadhesive membrane; the liver bright red, and the intestines rolled into many circum∣volutions.</P>
<P>I have seen a sugar-bird from St. Domingo, in which the bill and the tail were rather shorter, the eyebrows white, and on the throat a sort of whitish mark, which was larger than in the
<PB N="535" REF="574"/>
above female; in all other respects it was ex∣actly similar.</P>
<P>Lastly, Linnaeus regards the Bahama creeper of Brisson as the same with the sugar-birds of Martinico and Jamaica <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certhia Flaveola, var. 2. <HI>Linn. &amp; Gmel.</HI> The Bahama Titmouse, <HI>Catesby.</HI></NOTE>. Its plumage is in∣deed very similar; all the upper side is brown, including even the quills of the wings and of the tail; the latter are whitish beneath; the throat is light yellow; the anterior edge of the wings, their inferior coverts, and the rest of the under side of the body, of a deeper yellow as far as the lower belly, which is of the same brown as the back. Further, this bird is larger than the other sugar-birds; so that it may be regarded as a variety of size and even of cli∣mate. The following are the dimensions com∣pared:</P>
