<P><HI>§ 1.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> HAVING finished the detail of the actions
atchieved in the European seas by the naval
forces of Great-Britain within the compass of the present
year, we shall now proceed to record the exploits of the
British arms within the tropicks, and particularly the ex∣pedition
to Martinique and Guadaloupe, which is said to
have succeeded even beyond the expectation of the ministry.
A plan had been formed for improving the success of the
preceding year in North-America, by carrying the British
arms up the river St. Laurence, and besieging Quebeck,
the capital of Canada. The armament employed against
the French islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe con∣stituted
part of this design, inasmuch as the troops em∣barked
on that expedition were, in case of a miscarriage at
Martinique, intended to re-enforce the British army in
North-America, which was justly considered as the chief
seat of the war. What hope of success the administration
conceived from an attempt upon Martinique may be
guessed from the state of that island, as it appeared in a
memorial presented by the French King's lieutenants of its
several districts, to the general of the French islands, in
consequence of an order issued in November, for holding
them in readiness to march and defend the island from the
English, of whose design they were apprised. They re∣presented,
that the trade with the Dutch was become their
sole dependence; that they could expect no succour from
Europe, by which they had been abandoned ever since the
commencement of the war: that the traders vested with
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
the privilege of trafficking among them had abused the
intention of the general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1759.</NOTE> and, insted of being of service
to the colony, had fixed an arbitrary price for all the pro∣visions
which they brought in, as well as for the commo∣dities
which they exported; of consequence, the former
was valued at as high a price as their avarice could exact,
and the latter sunk as low in value as their own selfish
hearts could conceive: that the colony for two months had
been destitute of all kinds of provision; the commodities
of the planters lay upon their hands; and their negroes
were in danger of perishing through hunger; a circum∣stance
that excited the apprehension of the most dreadful
consequences; as to slaves half-starved, all kinds of
bondage were equal; and people reduced to such a situ∣ation
were often driven to despair, seeking in anarchy and
confusion a remedy from the evils by which they were
oppressed: that the best provided of the inhabitants la∣boured
under the want of the common necessaries of life; and
others had not so much as a grain of salt in their houses:
that there was an irreparable scarcity of slaves to cultivate
their land; and the planters were reduced to the necessity
of killing their cattle to support the lives of those who
remained alive; so that the mills were no longer worked,
and the inhabitants consumed beforehand what ought to
be reserved for their sustenance, in case of being blocked
up by the enemy. They desired, therefore, that the
general would suppress the permissions granted to particu∣lar
merchants, and admit neutral vessels freely into their
ports, that they might trade with the colonists unmolested
and unrestrained. They observed, that the citadel of
Port-Royal seemed the principal object on which the
safety and defence of the country depended; as the loss of
it would be necessarily attended with the reduction of the
whole island: they, therefore, advised that this fort should
be properly provided with every thing necessary for its
safety and defence; and that magazines of provision as well
as ammunition should be established in different quarters
of the island. This remonstrance plainly proves that the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
island was wholly unprepared to repel the meditated in∣vasion, and justifies the plan adopted by the ministry of
Great-Britain. The regular troops of Martinique con∣sisted
of about twenty independent companies greatly de∣fective
in point of number. The militia was composed
of burghers and planters distressed and dissatisfied, mingled
with a parcel of wretched negro slaves, groaning under
the most intolerable misery, from whence they could have
no hope of deliverance but by aspeedy change of masters;
their magazines were empty, and their fortifications out
of repair.</P>
<P>§ II. Such was the state of Martinique, when the in∣habitants
every day expected a visit from the British arma∣ment,
whose progress we shall now relate. On the
twelfth day of November, in the preceding year, Captain
Hughes sailed from St. Helen's, with eight sail of the line,
one frigate, four bomb-ketches, and a fleet of transports,
having on board six regiments of infantry, and a detacl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ment
of artillery, besides eight hundred marines distri∣buted
among the ships of war, this whole force being
under the command of Major-General Hopson, an old
experienced officer, assisted by Major-General Barrington,
the Colonels Armiger and Haldane, the Lieutenant-Colo∣nels
Trapaud and Clavering, acting in the capacity of
brigadiers. After a voyage of seven weeks and three days,
the fleet arrived at Barbadoes, and anchored in Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lisle∣bay,
where they joined Commodore Moore, appointed by
his Majesty to command the united squadrons amounting
to ten ships of the line, besides frigates and bomb-ketches.
Ten days were employed in supplying the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet with wood
and water, in waiting for the hospital ship in reviews, re∣embarkations,
councils of war, assemblies of the council
belonging to the island, in issuing proclamations, and
beating up for volunteers. At length, every great ship
being re-enforced with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orty negroes, to be employed in
drawing the artillery; and the troops, which did not ex∣ceed
sive thousand eight hundred men, being joined by
two hundred Highlanders, belonging to the second batta∣lion
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
of the regiment commanded by Lord John Murray
in North-America, who were brought as recruits from
Scotland, under convoy of the ship Ludlow-castle, the
whole armament sailed from Carlisle-bay on the 13th day
of January: but by this time the troops, unaccustomed to a
hot climate, were considerably weakened and reduced by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers, diarrhoeas, the scurvy, and the small-pox; which
last disease had unhappily broke out amongst the transports.
Next morning the squadron discovered the island of Mar∣tinique,
which was the place of its destination. The
chief fortification of Martinique was the citadel of Port-Royal,
a regular fort, garrisoned by four companies that
did not exceed the number of one hundred and fifty
men, thirty-six bombardiers, eighty Swiss, and fourteen
officers. One hundred barrels of beef constituted their
whole store of provision; and they were destitute of all
other necessaries. They were almost wholly unprovided
with water in the cisterns, with spare carriages for their
cannon, match, wadding, and langrage: they had but a
small stock of other ammunition, and the walls were in
many parts decayed. The only preparations they had
made for receiving the English were some paltry en∣trenchments
thrown up at St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierre, and a place called
Casdenavires, where they imagined the descent would
probably be attempted. On the fifteenth day of the
month the British squadron entered the great bay of Port-Royal,
some of the ships being exposed to the shot of a
battery erected on the isle de Ranieres, a little island
about half way up the bay. At their first appearance,
the Florissant, of seventy four guns, which had been so
roughly handled by Captain Tyrrel, in the Buckingham,
then lying under the guns of Fort Negro, along with two
frigates, turned up under the Citadel, and came to an an∣chor
in the Carenage, behind the sortification. One fri∣gate,
called the Ves<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, under favour of the night, made
her escape through the transports, and directed her course
for Europe; where she was taken by Captain Hood, as we have
already related. Next day three ships of the line were
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
ordered to attack Fort-Negro, 1759. a battery at the distance
of three miles from the Citadel, which, being mounted
with seven guns only, was soon silenced, and immediately
possessed by a detachment of marines and sailors; who be∣ing
landed in flat-bottomed boats, clambered up the rock,
and entered through the embrasures with their bayonets
fixed; here, however, they met with no resistance. The
enemy had abandoned the fort with precipitation. The
British colours were immediately hoisted, and sentinels of
marines posted upon the parapet. The next care was to
spike and disable the cannon, break the carriages, and
destroy the powder which they found in the magazine: ne∣vertheless,
the detachment was ordered to keep possession
of the battery. This service being successfully performed,
three ships were sent to reduce the other battery at Casde∣navires,
which consisted only of four guns, and these were
soon rendered unserviceable. The French troops, re-en∣forced
with militia which had been detached from the
Citadel to opposethe disembarkation, perceiving the whole
British squadron, and all the transports, already within
the bay, and Fort-Negro occupied by the marines, retired
to Port-Royal, leaving the beach open; so that the Eng∣lish
troops were landed without opposition, and, being
formed, advanced into the country towards Fort Negro,
in the neighbourhood of which they lay all night upon
their arms; while the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet, which had been galled by bomb-shells
from the Citadel, shifted their station, and stood far∣ther
up the bay. By ten next day the English officers had
brought up some field-pieces to an eminence, and scour∣ed
the woods, from whence the troops had been greatly
annoyed by the small shot of the enemy during the best
part of the night, and all that morning. At noon the Bri∣tish
forces advanced in order towards the hill that over∣looked
the town and citadel of Port-Royal, and sustained
a troublesome fire from enemies they could not see; for the
French militia were entirely covered by the woods and
bushes. This eminence, called the Morne Tortueson,
though the most important post of the whole island, was
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
neglected by the general of Martinique, who had resolved
to blow up the fortifications of the Citadel: but, luckily
for the islanders, he had not prepared the materials for this
operation, which must have been attended with the imme∣diate
destruction of the capital, and indeed of the whole
country. Some of the inferior officers, knowing the im∣portance
of the Morne Tortueson, resolved to defend that
post with a body of the militia, which was re-enforced by
the garrisorts of Fort-Negro and Casdenavires, as well as by
some soldiers detached from the Florissant: but, notwith∣standing
all their endeavours, as they were entirely un∣provided
with cannon, extremely defective in point of dis∣cipline,
dispirited by the pusillanimity of their governour,
and in a great measure disconcerted by the general conster∣nation
that prevailed among the inhabitants, in all proba∣bility
they could not have withstood a spirited and well-conducted
attack by regular forces. About two o'clock
General Hopson thought proper to desist from his attempt.
He gave the Commodore to understand that he could not
maintain his ground, unless the squadron would supply him
with heavy cannon, landed near the town of Port-Royal,
at a savannah, where the boats must have been greatly ex∣posed
to the fire of the enemy, or assist him in attacking the
Citadel by sea, while he should make his approaches by
land. Both these expedients<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Commodore offered to land the cannon on the other side of Point-Negro, at a place equally near the road from the English at my to Port-Royal, and even cause them to be drawn up by the seamen, without giving the troops the least trouble. But this offer was not accepted. General Hopson after∣wards declared, that he did not understand Mr. Moore's message in the sense which it was meant to imply.</NOTE> being deemed impracticable
by a council of war, the troops were recalled from their
advanced posts, and re-embarked in the evening, without
any considerable molestation from the enemy. Their at∣tempt
on the Morne Tortueson had cost them several men,
including two officers, killed or wounded in the attack;
and in revenge for this loss, they burned the sugar-canes,
and desolated the country in their retreat. The inha∣bitants
of Martinique could hardly credit the testimony of
their own senses, when they saw themselves thus delivered
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
from all their fears, at a time when they were overwhelme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with terrour and confusion; when the principal individuals
among them had resigned all thought of further resistanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and were actually assembled at the publick hall in Port-Royal,
to send deputies to the English general, with pro∣posals
of capitulation and surrender.</P>
<P>§ III. The majority of the British officers, who consti∣tuted
a council of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held for this purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Commodore did not attend at this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uncil: it was convoked to de∣liberate upon the opinion of the chief engineer, who thought they should make and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Carenage. In this case, the pilots declared it would be extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if not impracticable, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet to keep up a communication with the army.</NOTE>, having given
their opinion, that it might be for his Majesty's service to
make an attack upon St. Pierre, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet proceeded to that
part of the island, and entered the bay on the ninetcenth.
The Commodore told the General, that he made no
doubt of being able to reduce the town of St. Pierre, but
as the ships might be disabled in the attack, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as not to be
in a condition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dimmediately on any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> service;
as the troops might be reduced in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so as to be
incapable of future attacks; and as the reduction of the
island of Gaudaloupe would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of great benefit to the sugar
colonies, Mr. Moore proposed th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the armament should
immediately proceed to that island<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the General
agreed to the proposa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The reasons produced on this oc∣casion
are, we apprehend, such as may be urged against
every operation of war. Certain it is, no conquest can be
attempted, either by sea or land, without exposing the
ships and troops to a possibility of being dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed and di∣minished;
and the same possibility militated as strongly
against an attempt upon Guadaloupe, as it could possible
discourage the attack of st. Pierre. Besides, Martinique
was an object of greater importan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Only a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being the seat of government: for Guadaloupe makes a much greater quantity of sugar, and equipped a much greater number of privateers, with the assistance of the Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustatia, situated in its neighbourhood.</NOTE> than Guadaloupe;
as being the principal place possessed by the French in
those seas, and that to which the operations of the arma∣ment
were expressly limited by the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tructions received from
the ministry. St. Pierre was a place of considerable com∣merce;
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
and at that very juncture above forty sail of mer∣chant-ships
lay at anchor in the bay. The town was de∣fended
by a citadel regularly fortified, but at that time
poorly garrisoned; and so situated as to be accessible to
the sire of the whole squadron: for the shore was bold,
and the water sufficient to float any ship of the line. Be∣fore
the resolution of proceeding of Guadaloupe was taken,
the Commodore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad ordered the bay to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded, and
directed he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ippon to advance, and silence a battery
situated a mile and a half to the northward of St. Pierre.
Accordingly, Captain J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ky<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who commanded that ship,
stood in, and anchoring close to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hore, attacked it with
such impetuosity, that in a few minutes it was abandoned.
At the same time the Rippon was exposed to the fire of
three other batteries, from which she received considerable
damage both in her hull and rigging; and was in great
danger of running a-ground, when orders were given to
tow her out of danger.</P>
<P>§ IV. The whole armament having abandoned the
design on Martinique, directed their course to Guadaloupe,
another of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> islands, lying at the distance of
thirty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the westward, about fifteen leagues in
length, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in breadth; divided into two parts by a
small channel, within the inhabitants cross in a ferry-boat.
The western division is know by the name of Basseterre;
and here the metropolis stands defended by the citadel,
and other sortifications. The eastern part, called Grand∣terre,
is desitute of fresh water, which abounds in the
other division, and is defended by Fort-Louis, with a re∣doubt,
which commands the road in the district of Gosier.
The g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, or canal, that separates the two parts is di∣stinguished
by the appellation of the Salt River, having a
road or bay at each end; namely, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cul de Sac,
and the small Cul de Sac. Guadasoupe is in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbered with
high mountains and precipices, to which the inhabitants
used to convey their valuable effects in time of danger: but
here are also beautiful plains watered by brooks and rivers,
which fertilise the soil, enabling it to produce a great
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
quantity of sugar, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and cassia;
besides plenty of rice, potatoes, all kinds of pulse, and fruit
peculiar to the island. The country is populous and flou∣rishing,
and the government comprehends two smaller
islands, called All-Saints, and Deseada, which appear at a
small distance from the coast, on the eastern side of the
island. The British squadron having arrived at Basseterre,
it was resolved to make a general attack by sea upon the
citadel, the town, and other batteries by which it was de∣fended.
A disposition being made for this purpose, the
large ships took their respective stations next morning,
which was the twenty-third day of January. At nine,
the Lion, commanded by Captain Trelawney, began the
engagement against a battery of nine guns; and the rest
of the fleet continued to place themselves a-breast of the
other batteries and the citadel, which mounted forty-six
cannon, besides two mortars. The action in a little time
became general, and was maintained on both sides for se∣veral
hours with great vivacity, while the Commodore,
who had shifted his pendant into the Woolwich frigate,
kept aloof without gun-shot, that he might be the more
disengaged to view the state of the battle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He shifted his broad pendant on board the Wool wich, as well to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and keep the transports together in a proper posture for the landing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oops, as to cover the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isembar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, and also to consult proper measures with the general, who saw the necessity of Mr. Moore's being with him; and requested that he, with the other general officers and engineers, might be ad∣mitted on board the Woolwich, in order to consult, and take the earliest op∣portunity of landing the troops, as the service necessarily required.</NOTE>, and give his
orders with the greater deliberation. This expedient of
an admiral's removing his slag, and retiring from the action
while his own ship is engaged, however consonant to
reason, we do not remember to have seen practised upon
any other occasion, except in one instance at Carthagena,
where Sir Chaloner Ogle quitted his own ship, when she
was ordered to stand in, and cannonade the fort of Boca-Chica.
In this present attack, all the sea commanders be∣haved
with extraordinary spirit and resolution, particularly
the Captains Leslie, Burnet, Gayton, Jekyll, Trelawney,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
and Shuldam; who, in the hottest tumult of the action,
distinguished themselves equally by their courage, impe∣tuosity
and deliberation. About sive in the afternoon
the fire of the citadel slackened. The Burford and Ber∣wick
were driven out to sea; so that Captain Shuldam, in
the Panther, was unsustained; and two batteries played
upon the Rippon, Captain Jekyll, who, by two in the af∣ternoon,
silenced the guns of one, called the Morne-rouge;
but at the same time could not prevent his ship from run∣ning
a-ground. The enemy perceiving her disaster, assem∣bled
in great numbers on the hill, and lined the trenches,
from whence they poured in a severe fire of musquetry.
The militia afterwards brought up a cannon of eighteen
pound ball, and for two hours raked her fore and aft with
considerable effect: nevertheless, Captain Jekyll returned
the fire with equal courage and perseverance, though his
people dropped on every side, until all his grape shot and
wadding was expended, and all his rigging cut to pieces;
to crown his misfortune, a box, containing nine hundred
cartridges, blew up on the poop, and set the ship on fire;
which, however, was soon extinguished. In the mean
time, the Captain threw out a signal of distress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In all probability it was not perceived by the Commod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te.</NOTE>; to which
no regard was paid, till Captain Lestie, of the Bristol, com∣ing
from sea, and observing his situation, ran in between
the Rippon and the battery; and engaged with such im∣petuosity,
as made an immediate diversion in favour of
Captain Jekyll, whose ship remained a-ground, notwith∣standing
all the assistance that could be given, till mid∣night,
when she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and escaped from the very jaws of
destruction. At seven in the evening, all the other large
ships having silenced the guns to which they had been re∣spectively
opposed, joined the rest of the fleet. The
four bombs being anchored near the shore, began to ply the
town with shells and carcasses; so that in a little time the
houses were in flames, the magazines of gunpowder blew
up with the most terrible explosion; and about ten o'clock
the whole place blazed out in one general conslagration.
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
Next day, at two in the afternoon, the fleet came to an
anchor in the road of Basseterre, when they found the
hulls of divers ships which the enemy had set on fire at
their approach: several ships turned out, and endeavoured
to escape, but were intercepted and taken by the English
squadron. At five the troops landed without opposition,
and took possession of the town and citadel, which they
found entirely abandoned. They learned from a Genoese
deserter, that the regular troops of the island consisted of
five companies only, the number of the whole not exceed∣ing
one hundred men; and that they had laid a train to
blow up the powder magazine in the citadel: but had been
obliged to retreat with such precipitation, as did not per∣mit
them to execute this design. The train was imme∣diately
cut off, and the magazine secured. The nails
with which they have spiked up their cannon were drilled
out by the matrosses; and in the mean time the British
colours were hoisted on the parapet. Part of the troops
took possession of an advantageous post on an eminenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and part entered the town, which still continued burning
with great violence. In the morning, at day-break, the
enemy appeared, to the number of two thousand, about
four miies from the town, as if they intended to throw up
entrenchments in the neighbourhood of a house where the
governor had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixed his head-quarters, declaring he would
maintain his ground to the last extremity. To this reso∣lution,
indeed, he was encouraged by the nature of the
ground, and the neighbourhood of a pass called the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
d'Ane, a cleft through a mountainous ridge, opening a
communication with Capesterre, a more level and beautiful
part of the island. The ascent from Basseterre to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
pass was so very s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep, and the way so broken and inter∣rupted
by rocks and gullies, that there was no pros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
of attacking it with success, except at the first landing, when the inhabitants were under the dominion of a pani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.
They very soon recovered their spirits and recollection,
assembled and fortified themselves among the hills, armed
and arrayed their negroes, and affected to hold the invaders
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
at de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance. A flag of truce being sent, with offers of terms,
to their governor, the Chevalier d'Etreil, he rejected
them in a letter, with which his subsequent conduct but
ill agreed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter was to this effect:
<HI>To their Excellencies Mess. Hop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en and M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, General Officers of his Britannick Majesty, at Bass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>re.</HI> “Gentlemen, I Have received the letter which your Excellencies have done me the ho∣nour to write, ”of the twenty-fifth.

had been such as gave a very unfavourable impression of
his character. When the British squadron advanced to
the attack, instead of visiting in person the citadel and the
batteries, in order to encourage and animate his people by
his exhortation and example, he retired out of the reach
of danger to a distant plantation, where he remained a
tame spectator of the destruction in which his principal
town and citadel were involved. Next morning, when he
ought to have exerted himself in preventing the disem∣barkation
of the English troops, who had a difficult shore
and violent surf to surmount, and when he might have
defended the entrenchments and lines which had been
made to oppose their landing; he abandoned all these ad∣vantages,
and took shelter among the mountains that were
deemed inaccessible.</P>
<P>§ V. But, howsoever deficient the governor might have
been in the article of courage, certain it is the inhabitants
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
behaved with great spirit and activity in defence of their
country. They continually harassed the scouring de∣tachments,
by firing upon them from woods and sugar
plantations, which last the English burned about their
ears in resentment. Their armed negroes were very ex∣pert
in this kind of bush-fighting. The natives or militi
appeared in considerable parties, and even encountere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
detached bodies of the British army. A lady of masculin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
courage, whose name was Ducharmey, having armed her
slaves, they made several bold attempts upon an advanced
post, occupied by Major Melville, and threw up entrench∣ments
upon a hill opposite to the station of this officer▪
who had all along signalized himself by his uncommon in∣terpidity,
vigilance and conduct. At length the work<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of this virago were stormed by a regular detachment
which, after an obstinate and dangerous conflict, entere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the entrenchment sword in hand, and burned the house
and plantations. Some of the enemy were killed, and a
great number taken. Of the English detachment twelve
soldiers were slain, and thirty wounded, including thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
subaltern officers, one of whom lost his arm. The greate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
body of the enemy always appeared at the governour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
head-quarters, where they had raised a redoubt, and throw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

advanced on the sixth day of February, in the morning

were their hopes in this particular disappointed. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
the army and the navy were invaded with fevers and other
diseases, epidemical in those hot countries; and the regi∣mental
hospitals were so crowded, that it was judged con∣venient
to send five hundred sick men to the island of An∣tigua,
where they might be properly attended.</P>
<P>§ VII. In the mean time, the reduction of the islanders
on the side of Guadaloupe appearing more and more im∣practicable,
the General resolved to transfer the seat of
war to the eastern and more fertile part of the island, called
Grand-terre, which, as we have already observed, was de∣fended
by a strong battery, called Fort-Louis. In pursu∣ance
of this determination, the great ships were sent round to
Grand-terre, in order to reduce this fortification, which
they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of Febru∣ary.
After a severe cannonading, which lasted six hours,
a body of marines being landed, with the Highlanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A re-enforcement of two or three hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighlanders had joined the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> immediately before the troops landed on Guadaloupe.</NOTE>,
they drove the enemy from their entrenchments sword
in hand, and, taking possession of the fort, hoisted the
English colours. In a few days after this exploit, Ge∣neral
Hopson dying at Basseterre, the chief command de∣volved
on General Barrington, who resolved to prosecute
the final reduction of the island with vigour and dispatch.
As one step towards this conquest, the Commodore or∣dered
two ships of war to cruise off the island of St. Eusta∣tia,
and prevent the Dutch traders from assisting the na∣tives
of Guadaloupe, whom they had hitherto constantly
supplied with provisions, since they retired to the moun∣tains.
General Barrington, on the very first day of his
command, ordered the troops who were encamped to
strike their tents and huts, that the enemy might imagine
he intended to remain in this quarter; but in a few days
the batteries in and about Basse-terre were blown up and
destroyed, the detachments recalled from the advanced
posts, and the whole army re-embarked, except one regi∣ment
with a detachment of artillery, left in garrison
at the citadel, the command of which was bestowed on
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Colonel Debrisay, an accomplished officer of great expe∣rience.
The enemy no sooner perceived the coast clear
than they descended from the hills, and endeavoured to
take possession of the town, from which however they
were driven by the fire of the Citadel. They afterward<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
erected a battery, from whence they annoyed this forti∣fication
both with shot and shells, and even threatened a
regular attack; but, as often as they approached the place,
they were repulsed by sallies from the castle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The battery which they had raised was attacked at noon, taken, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destroyed by Captain Blome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of the sixty first regiment.</NOTE>. In the
midst of these hostilities, the gallant Debrisay, together
with Major Trollop, one lieutenant, two bombardiers,
and several common soldiers, were blown up, and perished,
by the explosion of a powder-magazine at the slanked an∣gle
of the south-east bastion. The confusion necessarily
produced by such an unfortunate accident encouraged the
enemy to come pouring down from the hills, in order to
make their advantage of the disaster; but they were soon
repulsed by the fire of the garrison. The General, being
made acquainted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of Colonel Debrisay, con∣ferred
the government of the fort upon Major Melvil, and
sent thither the chief engineer to repair and improve the
fortifications.</P>
<P>§ VII. In the mean time, Commodore Moore having re∣ceived
certain intelligence that Mons. de Bompart had arri∣ved
at Martinique, with a squad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, consisting of eight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail of
the line and three frigates, having on board a whole battalion
of Swiss, and some other troops, to re-enforce the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rriso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the island, he called in his cruisers, and failed imme∣diately
to the bay of Dominique, an island to wind∣ward,
at the distance of nine leagues from Guadaloupe,
whence he could always <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to oppose any designs which
the French commander might form against the operations
of the British armaments. For what reason Mr. Moore
did not fail immediately to the bay of Port Royal in Mar∣tinique,
where he knew the French squadron lay at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣chor,
we shall not pretend to determine. Had he taken
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
that step, M. Bompart must either have given him battle,
or retired into the Carenage, behind the Citadel; in which
last case, the English commander might have anchored be∣tween
Pigeon-island and Fort-Negro, and thus blocked
him up effectually. By retiring to Dominique, he left
the sea open to French privateers, who roved along the
coasts of these islands, and in a very little time carrie into
Martinique above fourscore merchant-ships belonging to
the subjects of Great-Britain. These continual depreda∣tions,
committed under the nose of the English commo∣dore,
irritated the planters of the English islands, some
of whom are said to have circulated unfavourable re∣ports
of that gentleman's character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reasons assigned by the Commodore for his conduct in this parti∣cular are these:—The bay of Dominique was the only place in which he could tendezvous and unite his squadron. Here he refreshed his men, who were grown sickly in consequence of subsisting on salt provision. Here h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sup∣plied his ships with plenty of fresh water. Here he had intercourse once or twice every day with General Barrington, by means of small vessels which passed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> repassed from one island to the other. By remaining in this situa∣tion, he likewise maintained a communication with the English Leeward Islands, which being in a defenceless condition, their inhabitants were con∣stantly solliciting the commodore's protection; and here he supported the army, the commander of which was unwilling that be should remove to a greater distance. Had he sailed to Port-Royal, he would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the enemy's squadiron so disposed, that he could not have attacked them, unless M. de Bompart had been inclined to hazard an action. Had he anchored in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, all his crui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must have been employed in conveying provisions and stores to the squadron. There he could not have procu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed either fresh pro∣visions or water; nor could he have had any communication with, nor intel∣ligence from, the army in the Leeward Islands, in Iess than eight or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> days.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ VIII. General Barrington, being left with no more than
one ship of forty guns for the protection of the transports,
formed a plan of prosecuting the war in Guadaloupe by
detachments, and the success fully answered his expecta∣tion.
He determined to make a descent on the division of
the island called Grande-terre, and for that purpose allotted
six hundred men; who, under the command of Colonel
Crump, landed between the towns of St. Anne and St.
Francois, and destroyed some batteries of the enemy, from
whom he sustained very little opposition. While he was thus
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
employed, a detachment of three hundred men attacked
the town of Gosier, which, notwithsanding a severe fire,
they took by storm, drove the garrison into the woods,
set fire to the place and demolished the battery and en∣trenchment
raised for its defence. This service being
happily performed, the detachment was ordered to force
their way to Fort-Louis, while the garrison of that castle
was directed to make two sall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, in order to favour their
irruption. They accordingly penetrated with some loss
sustained in forcing a strong pass, and took possession of a
battery which the enemy had raised against the English
camp, in the neighbourhood of Fort-Louis. The Gene∣ral,
having hitherto succeeded in his designs, formed the
scheme of surprising at one time the three towns of Petit∣bourg,
Gonoyave, and St. Mary, situated on the Basse-terre
side of the little Cul de Sac, and committed the exe∣cution
of it to the Colonels Crump and Clavering: but the
night appointed for the service proved exceedingly dark and
tempestuous, and the Negro conductors were so frightened,
that they ran several of the flat-bottomed boats on the
shoals that skirt this part of the island. Colonel Clavering
landed with about eighty men: but found himself so en∣tangled
with mangrove trees, and the mud so impassably
deep, that he was obliged to re-embark, though not be∣fore
the enemy had discovered his design. This project
having miscarried, the general detached the same com∣manders,
whose gallantry and conduct cannot be suffi∣ciently
applauded, with a detachment of fifteen hundred
men, including one hundred and fifty volunteers from
Antigua, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnon∣ville,
at the bottom of the little Cul de Sac, under the
protection of his Majesty's ship Woolwich. The ene∣my
made no opposition to their landing; but retreated, as
the English advanced, to a strong entrenchment thrown
up behind the river Licorne, a post of the utmost im∣portance,
as it covered the whole country as far as the bay
of Mahaut, where provisions and supplies of all sorts were
landed from St. Eustatia. The river was rendered inac∣cessible
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
by a morass, covered with mangroves, except at
two narrow passes, which they had fortified with a redoubt,
and entrenchments well pallisaded, mounted with cannon,
and defended by a numerous militia: besides, the narrow
roads through which only they could be attacked were
intersected with deep and wide ditches. Notwithstanding
these disadvantages, the English commanders determined
to hazard an assault. While four field-pieces and two
howitzers maintained a constant fire upon the top of the
entrenchments, the regiment of Duroure and the High∣landers
advanced under this cover, firing by platoons with
the utmost regularity. The enemy, intimidated by their
cool and resolute behaviour, began to abandon the first
entrenchments on the left. Then the Highlanders drawing
their swords, and sustained by part of the regiment, threw
themselves in with their usual impetuosity, and followed
the fugitives pell-mell into the redoubt, of which they
took possession: but they still maintained their ground
within the entrenchments on the right, from whence they
annoyed the assailants both with musketry and cannon.
In half an hour, an occasional bridge being made, the
English troops passed the river, in order to attack this
post, which the enemy abandoned with precipitation:
notwithstanding all their haste, however, about seventy
were taken prisoners, and among these some of the most
considerable inhabitants of the island. This advantage
cost the English two officers and thirteen men killed, and
above fifty wounded.</P>
<P>§ IX. The roads being mended for the passage of the
artillery, the troops advanced towards Petit-bourg, har∣rassed
in their march by slying bodies of the enemy, and
arrived late at night on the banks of the river Lizarde,
the only ford of which the French had fortified with strong
entrenchments, protected by a battery of four cannon,
erected on a rising ground in their rear. Colonel Claver∣ing,
while he amused them all night at this place by a con∣stant
fire into their lines, transported in two canoes, which
he launched about a mile and a half farther down the river,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
a sufficient number of troops, by day-break, to attack
them on the other side in flank, while he advanced in front
at the head of his lit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le army; but they did not think
proper to sustain the assault. On the contrary, they no
soone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perceived his intention, than they forsook the post,
and fled without order. Colonel Clavering, having passed
the river, pursued them to Petit-bourg, which they had
also fortified; and here he found Captain Uvedale, of the
Grenada bomb-ketch, throwing shells into the redoubt.
He forthwith sent detachments to occupy the neighbouring
heights; a circumstance which the enemy no sooner ob∣served,
than they deserted the place, and retired with great
expedition. On the fifteenth day of April Captain Steel
destroyed a battery at Gonoyave, a strong post, which,
though it might have been defended against an army, the
French abandoned at his approach, after having made a
hasty discharge of their artillery. At the same time Colo∣nel
Crump was detached with seven hundred men to the
bay of Mahaut, where he burned the town and batteries,
which he found abandoned, together with a vast quan∣tity
of provisions, which had been brought from the
island of St. Eustatia. Colonel Clavering, having left a
small garrison at Petit-bourg, began his march on the
twentieth day of the month towards St. Mary's, where he
understood the enemy had collected their whole force,
thrown up entrenchments, and raised barricadoes: but they
had left their rear unguarded. The English commander
immediately detached Colonel Barlow, with a body of
troops, to attack them from that quarter, while he himself
advanced against the front of their entrenchment. They
stood but one cannon-shot, and then sled to their lines and
batteries at St. Mary's, the slanks of which were covered
with woods and precipices. When they perceived the
English troops endeavouring to surmount these difficul∣ties,
and turn their lines, they quitted them, in order to
oppose the design; and were immediately attacked with
such vivacity, in the face of a severe fire of musketry and
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
cannon, that they abandoned their ground, and fled in the
utmost confusion, leaving the field and all their artillery
to the victors, who took up their quarters for the night
at St. Mary's. Next day, they entered the charming coun∣try
of Capesterre, where eight hundred and seventy negroes
belonging to one planter surrendered at discretion. Here
Colonel Clavering was met by Messieurs de Clain villiers
and Duqueruy, deputed by the principal inhabitants of
the island, to know what capitulation would be granted.
These he conducted to Petit-bourg, where they were pre∣sented
to General Barrington, who considering the ab∣sence
of the fleet, the small number of his forces, daily
diminishing, the difficulty of the country, and the possi∣bility
of the enemy's being re-enforced from Martinique,
wisely took the advantage of their present panick, and
settled terms of capitulation without delay. The sanity
of this resolution soon appeared. The inhabitants had just
signed the agreement, when a messenger arrived in their
camp, with information, that M. de Beauharnois, the
general of the French islands, had landed at St. Anne's,
to the windward, with a re-enforcement from Martinique,
consisting of six hundred regulars from Europe, about
fifteen hundred volunteers, besides a great number of the
militia drafted from the companies of Martinique, with a
great supply of arms and ammunition, mortars and artil∣lery,
under convoy of the squadron commanded by M. de
Bompart, who no sooner learned that the capitulation was
signed, than he re-embarked the troops and stores with all
possible expedition, and returned to Martinique. Thus we
see the conquest of this important island, which is said to
produce a greater quantity of sugar than is made in any of
the English plantations, was as much owing to accident
as to the valour of the troops and the conduct of the ge∣neral:
for, had the re-enforcement arrived an hour sooner
than it actually landed, in all probability the English
would have found it impracticable to finish the reduction
of Guadaloupe. Be that as it may, the natives certainly
deserved great commendation, not only for perservering so
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
gallantly in defence of their country, but also for their
fortitude in bearing every species of distress. They now
quitted the Dos d'Ane, and all their other posts, and re∣turned
to their respective habitations. The town of Basse-terre
being reduced to a heap of ashes, the inhabitants
began to clear away the rubbish, and erect occasional
sheds, where they resumed their several occupations with
that good humour so peculiar to the French nation; and
General Barrington humanely indulged them with all th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
assistance in his power.</P>
<P>§ X. The small islands of Deseada, Los Santos, and Pe∣tit-terre
were comprised in the capitulation of Guadaloupe.
The inhabitants of Marigalante, which lies about three
leagues to the south-east of Grande-torre, extending
twenty miles in length, fifteen in breadth, flat and fertile,
but poorly watered and ill fortified, having refused to sub∣mit
when summoned by the squadron to surrender, Ge∣neral
Barrington resolved to reduce them by force. He
embarked a body of troops on board of transports, which
failed thither under convoy of three ships of war and two
bomb-vessels from Prince Rupert's Bay, and at their ap∣pearance
the islanders <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubmitting, received an English
garrison. Before this period, Commodore Moore having
received intelligence that M. de Bompart had sailed from
Martinique, with design to land a re-enforcement on
Guadaloupe, and that his squad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was seen seven leagues
to windward of Marigalante, he failed from Prince Ru∣pert's
Bay, and turned to windward. After having been
beaten about for five days to very little purpose, he received
notice from one of his cruisers, that the French admiral
had returned to Martinique; upon which information he
retired quietly to his former station in the bay of Domi∣nique,
the people of which were so insolent as to affirm,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n derision, that the English squadron sailed on one side
of the island, and the French upon the other, that they
might be sure of not meeting; but this, without doubt
was an impudent calumny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Commodore declare, that be carried a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>sail night and day <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order to come up with the French squadron, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> took every step that could be devised for that purpose.

§ XI. General Barrington, having happily finished the
conquest of Guadaloupe, gave notice to the Commodore,
that he intended to send back part of the troops, with the
transports to England, about the beginning of July. In
consequence of this intimation, Mr. Moore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed with
his squadron to Basseterre road, where he was next day
joined by two ships of the line from England, which ren∣dered
him greatly superior in strength to the commander
of the French squadrons, who had retired to the island of
Grenada, lying about eight leagues from Guadaloupe. Here
he was discovered by the ship Rippon, whose captain return∣ed
immediately to Basseterre, to make the commodore ac∣quainted
with this circumstance; but, before he could
weigh anchor, a frigate arrived, with information that
Bompart had quitted Grenada, and was supposed to have
directed his course to Hispaniola. The Commodore im∣mediately
dispatched the Ludlow-castle with this intelli∣gence
to Admiral Coates, who commanded the squadron
at Jamaica. General Barrington having made a tour of the
island, in order to visit and repair such fortifications as he
thought necessary to be maintained, and the affairs relating
to the inhabitants being entirely settled, he sent the High∣landers,
with a body of drafts, to North America, under
convoy: he garrisoned the principal strengths of the is∣land,
and left the chief command to Colonel Crump, who
had for some time acted as brigadier-general, Colonel
Clavering having been sent home to England with the
account of the capitulation. Colonel Melville, who had
signalized himself in a remarkable manner ever since their
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
first landing, continued governor of the citadel at Basse∣terre;
and the command at Grande-terre was conferred
on Colonel Delgarno. Three complete regiments were
allotted as a sufficient guard for the whole island, and the
other three were embarked for England. General Bar∣rington
himself went on board the Roebuck in the latter
end of June, and took his departure for England. About
a month after, the transports, under convoy of Captain.
Hughes, with a small squadron, set sail for Great Britain,
while Commodore Moore, with his large fleet, directed his
course to Antigua.</P>
<P>§ XII. While this armament had been employed in the
conquest of Guadaloupe, North America exhibited still
more sanguinary scenes of war and devastation, which, in
order properly to introduce, it will be necessary to explain
the steps that were taken on this continent, previous to
this campaign. In October of the preceding year, a grand
assembly was held at Easton, about ninety miles from Phi∣ladelphia;
and there peace was established, by a formal
treaty between Great Britain and the several nations of
Indians inhabiting the country between the Apalachian
mountains and the lakes. The Twightwees, however,
settled between the river Ohio and the lakes, did not assist
at this treaty, though some steps had been taken towards
an alliance with that people. The conferences were
managed by the governors of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey,
accompanied by Sir William Johnson's deputy for
Indian affairs, four members of the council at Pennsylva∣nia,
six members of the assembly, two agents for the pro∣vince
of New Jersey, a great number of planters, and
citizens of Philadelphia, chiefly quakers. They were
met by the deputies and chiefs of the Mohawks, Oneidoes,
Onondagoes, Cayugas, Senecas, Tuscaroras, Nanticoques,
and Conoys, the Tuteloes, Chugnues, Delawares, and
Unamies, the Minisinks, Mohicons, and Wappingers:
the whole number, including their women and children,
amounting to five hundred. Some of the Six Nations,
thinking themselves aggrieved by the British colonists,
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
who had imprisoned certain individuals of their nation,
and had killed a few, and treated others with contempt,
did not fail to express their resentment, which had been
artfully fomented by the French emissaries, even into an
open rupture. The Delawares and Minisinks, in par∣ticular,
complained that the English had encroached upon
their lands, and on that account were provoked to hosti∣lities:
but their chief, Teedyuscung, had made overtures
of peace; and, in the character of ambassador from all the
ten nations, had been very instrumental in forming this
assembly. The chiefs of the Six Nations, though very
well disposed to peace, took umbrage at the importance
assumed by one of the Delawares, over whom, as their
descendants, they exercise a kind of parental authority;
and on this occasion they made no scruple to disclose their
dissatisfaction. The business, therefore, of the English go∣vernors
at this congress was to ascertain the limits of
the lands in dispute, reconcile the Six Nations with their
nephews, the Delawares, remove every cause of misunder∣standing
between the English and the Indians, detach these
savages entirely from the French interest, establish a firm
peace, and induce them to exert their influence in persuad∣ing
the Twightwees to accede to this treaty. Those In∣dians,
though possessed of few ideas, circumscribed in their
mental faculties, stupid, brutal, and ferocious, conduct
themselves, nevertheless, in matters of importance to the
community, by the general maxims of reason and justice;
and their treaties are always founded upon good sense,
conveyed in a very ridiculous manner. Their language
is guttural, harsh, and polysyllabical; and their speech
consists of hyperbolical metaphors and similies, which in∣vest
in with an air of dignity, and heig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten the expression.
They manage their conferences by means of wampum, a
kind of bead, formed of a hard shell, either in single strings, or
sewed in broad belts of different dimensions, according to
the importance of the subject. Every proposition is offered,
every answer made, every promise corroborated, every de∣claration
attested, and every treaty confirmed, by producing
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
and interchanging these belts of wampum. The con∣ferences
were continued from the eighth to the twenty
sixth day of October, when every article was settled to
the mutual satisfaction of all parties. The Indian depu∣ties
were gratified with a valuable present, consisting of
looking-glasses, knives, tobacco-boxes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leeve-buttom,
thimbles, sheers, gunlocks, ivory combs, shirts, shoc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
stockings, hats, caps, handkerchiefs, thread, clothes,
blankets, gartering, serges, watch-coats, and a few suits
of laced clothes for their chieftains. To crown their
happiness, the stores of rum were opened: they drank
themselves into a state of brutalintoxication, and next day
returned in peace to their respective places of habitation</P>
<P>§ XIII. This treaty with the Indians, who had been
debauched from the interest of Great-Britain, auspi∣ciously
paved the way for those operations which had been
projected against the French settlements in Canada. In∣stead
of employing the whole strength of the British arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in North-America against one object, the ministry pro∣posed
to divide the forces, and make impressions on thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
different parts at once, that the enemy might be divided,
distracted, and weakened, and the conquest of Canad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
completed in one campaign. That the success might be
the more certain, the different expeditions were planned
in such a manner as to co-operate with each other, and
even join occasionally; so practicable was it thought for
them to maintain such a correspondence as would admit of
a junction of this nature. The project of this campaign
imported, that General Wolfe, who had distinguished
himself so eminently in the siege of Louisbourg, should
proceed up the river St. Laurence, as soon as the navi∣gation
should be clear of ice, with a body of eight thou∣sand
men, and a considerable squadron of ships from
England, to undertake the siege of Quebeck, the capital
of Canada: that General Amherst, who commanded in
chief, should, with another army of regular troops and pro∣vincials,
amounting to twelve thousand men, reduc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, cross the lake Champlain
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
and, proceeding along the river Richelieu to the banks of
the river St. Laurence, join General Wolfe in the siege of
Quebeck: that Brigadier-General Prideaux, with a third
body, re-enforced with a considerable number of friendly
Indians, assembled by the influence and under the com∣mand
of Sir William Johnson, should invest the French
fort erected by the fall or cataract of Niagara, which
was certainly the most important post of all French Ame∣rica▪
as it in a manner commanded all the interior parts of
that vast continent. It overawed the whole country of
the Six Nations, who were cajoled into a tame acquies∣cence
in its being built on their territory: it secured all the
inland trade, the navigation of the great lakes, the com∣munication
between Canada and Louisiana, and opened a
passage for inroads into the colonies of Great-Britain. It
was proposed, that the British forces, having reduced
Niagara, should be embarked on the lake Ontario, fall
down the river St. Laurence, besiege and take Montreal,
and then join or co-operate with Amherst's army. Be∣side
these larger armaments, Colonel Stanwix commanded
a smaller detachment for reducing smaller forts, and scour∣ing
the banks of the lake Ontario. How far this project
was founded on reason and military knowledge may be
judged by the following particulars, of which the pro∣jectors
were not ignorant. The navigation of the river
St. Laurence is dangerous and uncertain. The city of
Quebeck was remarkably strong from situation and forti∣fication,
from the bravery of the inhabitants, and the
number of the garrison. Monsieur de Montcalm, an
officer of great courage and activity, kept the field between
Montreal and Quebeck, with a body of eight or ten thou∣sand
men, consisting of regular troops and disciplined
militia, re-enforced by a considerable number of armed
Indians; and another body of reserve hovered in the neigh∣bourhood
of Montreal, which was the residence of Mon∣sieur
de Vaudreuil, governor general of Canada. The
garrison of Niagara consisted of above six hundred men;
the march to it was tedious and emibarrassed; and Mon∣sieur
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
de Levi scoured the country with a flying detachment, well acquainted with all the woods and passes. With
respect to General Amherst's share of the plan, the forts
of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point stood in his way. The
enemy were masters of the lake Champlain, and possessed
the strong fort of Chambly, by the fall of the river Riche∣lieu,
which defended the pass to the river St. Laurence.
Even had these obstacles been removed, it was hardly
possible that he and Mr. Wolfe should arrive at Quebeck
in the same instant of time. The first that reached it,
far from being in a condition to undertake the siege of
Quebeck, would have run the risk of being engaged and
defeated by the covering army; in which case, the other
body must have been exposed to the most imminent hazard
of destruction, in the midst of an enemy's country, far
distant from any place of safety to which it could retreat.
Had these disasters happened, and, according to the ex∣perience
of war, they were the natural consequences of the
scheme, the troops at Niagara would in all probability
have fallen an easy sacrifice, unless they had been so fortu∣nate
as to receive intelligence time enough to accomplish
their retreat before they could be intercepted. The design
would, we apprehend, have been more justifiable, or at
least not so liable to objection, had Mr. Amherst left two
or three regiments to protect the frontiers of New-York,
and joining Mr. Wolfe with the rest, failed up the river
St. Laurence to besiege Quebeck. Even in that case, the
whole number of his troops would not have been sufficient,
according to the practice of war, to invest the place and
cope with the covering <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy. Nevertheless had the en∣terprise
succeeded, Montcalm must either have hazarded
an engagement against great odds, or retired farther into
the country: then the route would have been open by land
and water to Montreal, which could have made little re∣sistance.
The two principal towns being taken, and the
navigation of the St. Laurence blocked up, all the depen∣dant
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts must have surrendered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discretion, except
Niagara, which there was a bare possibility of supplying,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
at an incredible trouble and expense, from the distant
Mississippi; but, even then, it might have been besieged
in form, and easily reduced. Whatever defects there might
have been in the plan, the execution, though it miscarried
in some essential points, was attended with surprising suc∣cess.
The same good fortune that prospered the British
arms so remarkably in the conquest of Guadaloupe seem∣ed
to interpose still more astonishingly in their favour at
Quebeck, the siege of which we shall record in its proper
place. At present, we must attend the operations of Ge∣neral
Amherst, whose separate army was first in motion,
though such impediments were thrown in his way as
greatly retarded the progress of his operations: impedi∣ments
said to have arisen from the pride, insolence, and
obstinacy of certain individuals, who possessed great influ∣ence
in that part of the world, and employed it all to
thwart the service of their country.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The summer was already far advanced before
General Amherst could pass lake George with his forces,
although they met with no opposition, and reach the
neighbourhood of Ticonderoga, where, in the preceding
year, the British troops had sustained such a terrible dis∣aster.
At first the enemy seemed determined to defend
this fortress: but perceiving the English commander reso∣lute,
cautious, and well prepared for undertaking the siege;
having, moreover, orders to retreat from place to place,
towards the centre of operations at Quebeck, rather than
run the least risk of being made prisoners of war; they in
the night of July the twenty-seventh abandoned the post,
after having in some measure dismantled the fortifications,
and retired to Crown Point, a fort situated on the verge
of lake Champlain. General Amherst, having taken pos∣session
of this important post, which effectually covered
the frontiers of New-York, and secured to himself a safe
retreat in case of necessity, ordered the works to be repair∣ed,
and allotted a strong garrison for its defence. This
acquisition, however, was not made without the loss of a
brave accomplished young officer, Colonel Roger Town∣shend,
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
who, in reconnoitring the fort, was killed with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
cannon-shot, and fell near the same spot which in the
former year had been enriched with the blood of the gal∣lant
Lord Howe, whom he strongly resembled in the cir∣cumstances
of birth, age, qualifications, and character</P>
<P>§ XV. While the General superintended the repairs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Ticonderoga, and the men were employed in preparing
batteaux and other vessels, his scouting parties hovered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the neighbourhood of Crown-Point, in order to watch the
motions of the enemy. From one of these detachment
he received intelligence, on the firstday of August, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
enemy had retired from Crown-Point. He immediatel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
detached a body of rangers before him, to take possessio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the place: then he embarked with the rest of the army
and on the fourth day of the month landed at the so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
where the troops were immediately encamped. His ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
care was to lay the foundation of a new fort, to be main∣tained
for the further security of the British dominions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that part of the country, and particularly for prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the inroads of scalping parties, by whom the plantatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had been dreadfully infested. Here information was r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceived
that the enemy had retired to the Isle aux N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the other end of the lake Champlain, five leagues <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the hither side of St. John's; that their force encamped <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that place, under the command of M. de Burlemaque
consisted of three battalions and five piquets of regul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
troops, with Canadians and marines, amounting in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whole to three thousand five hundred effective men, pro∣vided
with a numerous train of artillery; and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lake was occupied by four large vessels mounted with ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣non,
and manned with piquets of different regimen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
under the command and direction of M. le Bras, a capta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in the French navy, assisted by M. de Rigal and other s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
officers. In consequence of this intimation, General A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣herst,
who had for some time employed Captain Lori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to superinted the building of vessels at Ticonderoga, be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
resolved to have the superiority on the lake, directed the cap∣tain
to build with all possible expedition a sloop of sixteen
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
guns, and a radeau eighty-four feet in length, capa∣ble
of carrying six large cannon. These, together with a
brigantine, being finished, victualled and manned by the
eleventh day of October, the General embarked with the
whole of the troops in batteaux, in order to attack the
enemy; but next day, the weather growing tempestuous,
was obliged to take shelter in a bay on the western shore,
where the men were landed for refreshment. In the mean
time, Captain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, with his small squadron, failed down
the lake, gave chase to a French schooner, and drove three
of their ships into a bay, where two of them were sunk,
and the third run a-ground by their own crew, who es∣caped:
one, however, was repaired and brought away by
Captain Loring, so that now the French had but one
schooner remaining. General Amherst, after having been
some days wind-bound, re-embarked his forces, and pro∣ceeded
down the lake; but the storm, which had abated,
beginning to blow with redoubled fury, so as to swell the
waves mountain high, the season for action being elapsed,
and winter setting in with the most rigorous severity, he
saw the impossibility of accomplishing his design, and was
obliged to desist. Returning to the same bay where he
had been sheltered, he landed the troops, and began his
march for Crown-point, where he arrived on the twenty-first
day of October. Having secured a superiority on the
lake, he now employed all his attention in rearing the
new fortress at Crown-Point, together with three small
out-forts for its better defence; in opening roads of com∣munication
with Ticonderoga, and the governments of
Massachusett's and New Hampshire; and in making dispo∣sitions
for the winter-quarters of his troops, so as to pro∣tect
the country from the inroads of the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XVI. During the whole summer he received not the
least intelligence of Mr. Wolfe's operations, except a few
hints in some letters relating to the exchange of prisoners,
that came from the French general, Montcalm, who gave
him to understand, that Mr. Wolfe had landed in the
neighbourhood of Quebeck, and seemed determined to
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
undertake the siege of that city; that he had honoured him
(the French general) with several notes, sometimes couched
in a soothing strain, sometimes filled with threats that the
French army intended to give him battle, and a few days
would determine the fate of Quebeck. Though Mr. Am∣herst
was ignorant of the proceedings of the Quebeck squa∣dron,
his communication continued open with the forces
which undertook the siege of Niagara; and he received an
account of their success before he had quitted the lines of
Ticonderoga. General Prideaux, with his body of troops,
re-enforced by the Indian auxiliaries under Sir William
Johnson, advanced to the cataract of Niagara, without
being exposed to the least inconvenience on his march;
and investing the French fortress about the middle of
July, carried on his approaches with great vigour till the
twentieth day of that month, when, visiting the trenches,
he was unfortunately slain by the bursting of a cohorn.
Mr. Amherst was no sooner informed of his disaster, than
he detached Brigadier-General Gage from Ticonderoga,
to assume the command of that army. In the mean time,
it devolved on Sir William Johnson, who happily prosecut∣ed
the plan of his predecessor with all the success that
could have been desired. The enemy, alarmed with the
apprehension of losing a place of such importance, resolv∣ed
to exert their endeavours for its relief. They assem∣bled
a body of regular troops, amounting to twelve hun∣dred
men, drawn from Detroit, Venango, and Presque
Isle; and these, with a number of Indian auxiliaries, were
detached under the command of Monsieur d'Aubry, on
an attempt to re-enforce the garrison of Niagara. Sir Wil∣liam
Johnson having received intelligence of their design,
made a disposition to intercept them in their march. In
the evening he ordered the light infantry and picquets to
post themselves to the left, on the road leading from Nia∣gara
falls to the fortress: these were re-enforced in the
morning with the grenadiers, and part of the forty-sixth
regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Massey;
and another regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Farquhar,
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
was posted at the tall of the works, in order to support the
guard of the trenches. About eight in the morning, the
enemy being in sight, the Indians in the English army ad∣vanced
to speak with their countrymen who served under
the French banners; but this conference was declined
by the enemy. Then the French Indians having uttered
the horrible scream called the war-whoop, which by this
time had lost its effect among the British forces, the ene∣my
began the action with impetuosity: but they met with
such a hot reception in front, while the Indian auxiliaries
fell upon their flanks, that in a little more than half an
hour their whole army was routed, their general, with all
his officers, taken, and the pursuit continued through the
woods for several miles with considerable slaughter. This
battle, which happened on the twenty-fourth day of July,
having been fought in sight of the French garrison at
Niagara, Sir William Johnson sent Major Harvey with a
trumpet to the commanding officer, to present him with a
list of seventeen officers taken in the engagement, and to
exhort him to surrender before more blood was shed, while
he had it in his power to restrain the Indians. The com∣mandant,
having certified himself of the truth, by send∣ing
an officer to visit the prisoners, agreed to treat, and in
a few hours the capitulation was ratified. The garrison,
consisting of six hundred and seven effective men, marched
out with the honours of war, in order to be embarked in
vessels on the lake, and conveyed in the most expeditious
manner to New-York. They laid down their arms when
they embarked; but were permitted to keep their baggage,
and, by a proper escorte, protected from the savage inso∣lence
and rapacity of the Indians. All the women were con∣ducted,
at their own request, to Montreal; and the sick
and wounded, who could not bear the satigue of travelling,
were treated with humanity. This was the second com∣plete
victory obtained on the continent of North-America,
in the course of the same war, by Sir William Johnson,
who, without the help of a military education, succeeded
so signally in the field by dint of innate courage and natural
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
sagacity. What remarkably characterises these battles,
is the circumstance of his having taken in both the
commander of the enemy. Indeed, the war in general
may be distinguished by the singular success of this gen∣tleman
and the celebrated Lord Clive, two self-taught
generals; who, by a series of shining actions, have de∣monstrated,
that uninstructed genius can, by its own in∣ternal
light and efficacy, rival, if not eclipse, the acquired
art of discipline and experience. Sir William Johnson
was not more serviceable to his country by his valour and
conduct in the field, than by the influence and authority
which his justice, benevolence, and integrity had acquired
among the Indian tribes of the Six Nations, whom he not
only assembled at Niagara to the number of eleven hun∣dred,
but also restrained with the bounds of good order
and moderation.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The reduction of Niagara, and the possession
of Crown-Point, were exploits much more easily atchieved
than the conquest of Quebeck, the great object to which
all these operations were subordinate. Of that we now
come to give the detail, fraught with singular adventures
and surprising events; in the course of which a noble spirit
of enterprise was displayed, and the scenes of war were
exhibited in all the variety of desolation. It was about
the middle of February that a considerable squadron sailed
from England for Cape-Breton, under the command of
Admirals Saunders and Holmes, two gentlemen of worth
and probity, who had on several occasions signalised their
courage and conduct in the service of their country. By
the twenty-first day of April they were in sight of Louis∣bourg;
but the harbour was blocked up with ice in such
a manner, that they were obliged to bear away for Hali∣fax,
in Nova-Scotia. From hence Rear-Admiral Durell
was detached, with a small squadron, to fail up the river
St. Laurence as far as the isle de Coudres, in order to in∣tercept
any supplies from France intended for Quebec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
he accordingly took two store-ships; but he was anticipated
by seventeen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, laden with provision, stores, and some
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
recruits, under convoy of three frigates, which had already
reached the capital of Canada. Mean while, Admiral
Saunders arrived at Louisbourg; and the troops being em∣barked,
to the number of eight thousand, proceeded up
the river without further delay. The operations by land
were entrusted to the conduct of Major-General James
Wolfe, whose talents had shone with such superior lustre
at the siege of Louisbourg; and his subordinates in com∣mand
were the Brigadiers Monckton, Townshend, and
Murray; all four in the flower of their age, who had
studied the military art with equal eagerness and profi∣ciency,
and, though young in years, were old in experi∣ence.
The first was a soldier by descent, the son of Major-General
Wolfe, a veteran officer of acknowledged capa∣city:
the other three resembled each other, not only in
years, qualifications, and station, but also in family rank,
all three being the sons of noblemen. The situation of
Brigadier Townshend was singular: he had served abroad
in the last war with reputation, and resigned his com∣mission
during the peace, in disclain of some hard usage he
had sustained from his superiors. That his military ta∣lents,
however, might not be lost to his country, he exer∣cised
them with equal spirit and perseverance in projecting
and promoting the plan of a national militia. When the
command and direction of the army devolved to a new
leader, so predominant in his breast was the spirit of pa∣triotism
and the love of glory, that though heir apparent
to a British peerage, possessed of a very affluent fortune,
remarkably dear to his acquaintance, and sollicited to a
life of quiet by every allurement of domestick felicity, he
waved these considerations: he burst from all entangle∣ments;
proffered his services to his sovereign; exposed
himself to the perils of a disagreeable voyage, the rigours
of a severe climate, and the hazard of a campaign pecu∣liarly
fraught with toil, danger, and difficulty.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The armament intended for Quebeck <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed
up the river St. Laurence, without having met with any
interruption, or having perceived any of those difficul∣ties
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
and perils with which it had been reported that the
navigation of it was attended.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> Their good fortune in this
particular, indeed, was owing to some excellent charts
of the river, which had been found in vessels taken from
the enemy. About the latter end of June the land-forces
were disembarked in two divisions upon the isle of Or∣leans,
situated a little below Quebeck, a large fertile island,
well cultivated, producing plenty of grain, abounding
with people, villages, and plantations. General Wolfe no
sooner landed on the island of Orleans, than he distributed
a manifesto among the French colonists, giving them to
understand, That the King his master, justly exasperated
against the French monarch, had equipped a con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderable
armament, in order to humble his pride, and was deter∣mined
to reduce the most considerable French settlements
in America. He declared, it was not against the indu∣stricus
peasants, their wives, and children, nor against the
ministers of religion, that he intended to make war: on
the contrary, he lamented his misfortunes to which they
must be exposed by the quarrel: he offered them his
protection, and promised to maintain them in their tem∣poral
possessions, as well as in the free exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of their
religion, provided they would remain quiet, and take no
part in the difference between the two crowns. He ob∣served,
that the English were masters of the river St. Lau∣rence,
so as to intercept all succours from Europe, and
had, besides, a powerful army on the continent, under the
command of General Amherst. He affirmed, that the
resolution they ought to take was neither difficult nor
doubtful, as the utmost exertion of their valour would be
useless, and serve only to deprive them of the advantages
which they might reap from their neutrality. He remind∣ed
them, that the cruelties exercised by the French upon
the subjects of Great-Britain in America would excuse
the most severe reprisals; but Britons were too generous
to follow such barbarous examples. He again offered to
the Canadians the sweets of peace, amidst the horrours of
war; and le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it to themselves to determine their own fate
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
by their own conduct. He expressed his hope, that the
world would do him justice, should they oblige him,
by rejecting these favourable terms, to adopt violent mea∣sures.
He expatiated upon the strength and power, as
well as upon the generosity of Great Britain, in thus
stretching out the hand of humanity; a hand ready to
assist them on all occasions, even when France was, by her
weakness, compelled to abandon them in the most critical
conjuncture. This declaration produced no immediate
effect; nor, indeed, did the Canadians depend upon the
sincerity and promised faith of a nation, whom their
priests had industriously represented as the most savage and
cruel enemy on earth. Possessed of these notions, which
prevailed even among the better sort, they chose to abandon
their habitations, and expose themselves and families to
certain ruin, in provoking the English by the most cruel
hostilities, rather than be quiet, and conside in the Ge∣neral's
promise of protection. Instead of pursuing this
prudent plan of conduct, they joined the scalping parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The operations of scalping, which, to the shame of both nations, was en∣couraged both by French and English, the savages perform in this manner:—The hap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess victim being disabled, or disarmed, the Indian, with a sharp knife, provided and worn for the purpose, makes a circular incision to the bone round the upper part of the head, and tear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the scalp with his sin∣gers. Previous to this execution, he generally dispatches the prisoner by re∣peated blows on the head with the hammer-side of an instrument called a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omahawk: but sometimes they save themselves the trouble, and sometimes the blows prove ineffectual, so that the miserable patient i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> groaning in the utmost agony of torture.

of Indians who skulked among the woods, and falling
upon the English stragglers by surprise, butchered them
with the most inhuman barbarity. Mr. Wolfe, whose na∣ture
revolted against this wanton and perfidious cruelty,
sent a letter to the French general, representing, that such
enormities were contrary to the rules of war observed
among civilized nations, dishonourable to the service of
France, and disgraceful to human nature: he, therefore,
desired the French colonists and Indians might be re∣strained
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
within due bounds, otherwise he would burn their
villages, desolate their plantations, and retaliate upon the
persons of his prisoners whatever cruel ties should, in the
sequel, be committed on the soldiers or subjects of his mas∣ter.
In all probability the French general's authority was
not sufficient to bridle the ferocity of the savages, who
continued to scalp and murther with the most brutal ap∣petite
for blood and revenge; so that Mr. Wolfe, in or∣der
to intimidate the enemy into a cessation of these out∣rages,
found it necessary to connive at some irregularities
in the way of retaliation.</P>
<P>§ XIX. M. de Montcalm, who commanded the French
troops, though superior in number to the invaders, very
wisely resolved to depend upon the natural strength of
the country, which appeared almost insurmountable, and
had carefully taken all his precautions of defence. The ci∣ty
of Quebeck was tolerably fortified, secured with a nu∣merous
garrison, and plentifully supplied with provision
and ammunition. Montcalm had re-enforced the troops
of the colony with five regular battalions, formed of the
best of the inhabitants, completely disciplined all the Ca∣nadians
of the neighbourhood capable of bearing arms,
and several tribes of savages. With this army he had taken
the field in a very advantageous situation, encamped along
the shore of Beaufort, from the river St. Charles to the
falls of Montmorenci, every accessible part being deeply
entrenched. To undertake the siege of Quebeck against
such odds and advantages was not only a deviation from
the established maxims of war, but a rash enterprise, seem∣ingly
urged in diametrical opposition to the dictates of
common sense. Mr. Wolfe was well acquainted with all
the difficulties of the undertaking; but he knew at the
same time he should always have it in his power to retreat
in case of emergency, while the British squadron main∣tained
its station in the river: he was not without hope
of being joined by General Amherst; and he was stimu∣lated
by an appetite for glory, which the prospect of ac∣cumulated
dangers could not allay. Understanding that
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
there was a body of the enemy posted, with cannon, at the
Point of Levi, on the south shore, opposite to the city of
Quebeck, he detached against them Brigadier Monckton,
at the head of four battalions, who passed the river at
night, and next morning, having skirmished with some
of the enemy's irregulars, obliged them to retire from that
post, which the English immediately occupied. At the
same time Colonel Carlton, with another detachment,
took possession of the western point of the island of Or∣leans;
and both these posts were fortified, in order to
anticipate the enemy, who, had they kept possession of
either, might have rendered it impossible for any ship to
lie at anchor within two miles of Quebeck. Besides, the
Point of Levi was within cannon-shot of the city, against
which a battery of mortars and artillery was immediately
erected. Montcalm, foreseeing the effect of this manoeu∣vre,
detached a body of sixteen hundred men across the
river, to attack and destroy the works before they were
completed: but the detachment fell into disorder, fired
upon each other, and retired in confusion. The battery
being finished without further interruption, the cannon
and mortars began to play with such success, that in a lit∣tle
time the upper town was considerably damaged, and
the lower town reduced to a heap of rubbish.</P>
<P>§ XX. In the mean time, the fleet was exposed to the
most imminent danger. Immediately after the troops had
been landed on the island of Orleans the wind increased
to a furious storm, which blew with such violence, that
many transports ran foul of one another, and were disabled.
A number of boats and small craft foundered, and divers
large ships lost their anchors. The enemy, resolving to
take advantage of the confusion which they imagined
this disaster must have produced, prepared seven fire-ships,
and at midnight sent them down from Quebeck among the
transports, which lay so thick as to cover the whole sur∣face
of the river. The scheme, though well contrived, and
seasonably executed, was entirely defeated by the delibe∣ration
of the British admiral, and the dexterity of his ma∣riners,
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
who resolutely boarded the fire-ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> and towed them
sast a-ground, where they lay burning to the water's edge,
without having done the least prejudice to the English
squadron. On the very same day of the succeeding
month, they sent down a raft of fire-ships, or radeaux,
which likewise consumed, without producing any effect.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The works for the security of the hospital, and
the stores on the island of Orleans, being finished, the
British forces crossed the north channel in boats, and
landing under cover of two sloops, encamped on the side
of the river Montmorenci, which divided them from the
left of the enemy. Next morning a company of rangers
posted in a wood to cover some workmen were attacked
by the French Indians and totally defeated: however,
the nearest troops advancing, repulsed the Indians in their
turn with considerable loss. The reasons that induced
General Wolfe to choose this situation by the falls of
Montmorenci, in which he was divided from Quebeck by
this, and another river called St. Charles, he explained in
a letter to the secretary of state. He observed, that the
ground which he had chosen was high, and in some mea∣sure
commanded the opposite side on which the enemy
was posted: that there was a ford below the falls, passable
in every tide for some hours at the latter part of the ebb
and beginning of the flood; and he hoped that means
might be found of passing the river higher up, so as to
tight the Marquis de Montcalm upon less disadvantageous
terms than those of directly attacking his entrenchments.
Accordingly, in reconnoitering the river Montmorenci,
a ford was discovered about three miles above; but the op∣posite
banks, which were naturally steep, and covered with
woods, the enemy had entrenched in such a manner, as
to render it almost inaccessible. The escorte was twice at∣tached
by the Indians, who were as often repulsed; but
these rencounters cost the English about forty men killed
and wounded, including some officers. Some shrewd ob∣jections
might be started to the general's choice of ground
on this occasion. He could not act at all without passing
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
the river Montmorenci at a very great disadvantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1759.</NOTE> and
attacking an enemy superior to himself in number, secured
by redoubts and entrenchments. Had he even, by dint of
extraordinary valour driven them from these strong posts,
the success must have cost him a great number of officers
and men; and the enemy might have retreated behind
the river St. Charles, which he must also have passed under
the same disadvantages, before he could begin his opera∣tions
against the city of Quebeck. Had his good fortune
enabled him to surmount all these difficulties, and after
all to defeat the enemy in a pitched battle, the garrison
of Quebeck might have been re-enforced by the wreck of
their army; and he could not, with any probability of suc∣cess,
have undertaken the siege of an extensive fortified
place, which he had not troops sufficient to invest, and
whose garrison would have been nearly equal in number
to the sum total of the troops he commanded. At any
rate, the chance of a fair engagement in the open field was
what he had little reason to expect in that situation, from
the known experience and the apparent conduct of the
French general. These objections appeared so obvious and
important, that General Wolfe would not determine to
risque an attack, until he had surveyed the upper part
of the river St. Laurence, in hopes of finding some place
more favourable for a descent.</P>
<P>§ XXII. On the eighteenth day of July, the Admiral,
at his request, sent two ships of war, two armed sloops,
and some transports, with troops on board, up the river;
and they passed the city of Quebeck, without having sus∣tained
any damage. The General being on board of this
little armament, carefully observed the banks on the side
of the enemy, which were extremely difficult from the
nature of the ground, and these difficulties were redoubled
by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oresight and precaution of the French comman∣der.
Though the descent seemed impracticable between the
city and Cape Rouge, where it was intended, General
Wolfe, in order to divide the enemy's force, and procure in∣telligence,
ordered a detachment, under the command of
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Colonel Carlton, to land higher up, at the Point au Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ble,
in which place he was informed a great number <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the inhabitants of Quebeck had retired with their mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣valuable
effects. This service was performed with little
loss, and some prisoners were brought away, but no maga∣zine
was discovered. The general thus disappointed in his
expectation, returned to Montmorenci, where Brigadie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
Townshend had, by maintaining a superior fire across that
that river, prevented the enemy from erecting a battery,
which would have commanded the English camp; and
now he resolved to attack them, though posted to great
advantage, and every where prepared to give him a warm
reception. His design was, first, to reduce a detached re∣doubt
close to the water's edge, seemingly situated with∣out
gun-shot of the entrenchment on the hill. Should this
fortification be supported by the enemy, he foresaw that
he should be able to bring on a general engagement; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the contrary, should they remain tame spectators of its re∣duction,
he could afterwards examine their situation a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
leisure, and determine the place at which they could be
most easily attacked. Preparations were accordingly mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for storming the redoubt. On the last day of July, in the
forenoon, part of Brigadier Monckton's brigade was em∣barked
in the boats of the fleet, to be transported from
the Point of Levi. The two brigades, commanded by the
Brigadiers Townshend and Murray, were drawn out, in
order to pass the ford when it should be necessary. To
facilitate their passage, the Admiral had stationed the
Centurion ship of war in the channel, to check the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the lower battery, by which the ford was commanded: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
numerous train of artillery was placed upon the emi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence,
to batter and ensilade the left of the enemy's entrench∣ments;
and two flat-bottomed armed vessels, prepared for
the purpose, were run a-ground near the redoubt, to favour
the descent of the forces. The manifest confusion produced
among the French by these previous measures, and by the
sire of the Centurion, which was well directed and sus∣tained,
determined Mr. Wolfe to storm this entrench∣ment
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
without further delay. Orders were issued, that the
three brigadiers should put their troops in motion at a cer∣tain
signal, which was accordingly made at a proper time
of the tide. Many of the boats from Point Levi ran
a-ground upon a ledge that runs off a considerable distance
from the shore; and this accident occasioned a disorder, by
which so much time was lost, that the general was obliged
to stop the march of Brigadier Townshend's corps, which
he perceived to be in motion. In the mean time, the boats
were floated, and ranged in proper order, though exposed
to a severe fire of shot and shells; and the general in per∣son
sounding the shore, pointed out the place where the
troops might disembark with the least difficulty. Thir∣teen
companies of grenadiers, and two hundred men of
the second American battalion, were the first who landed.
They had received orders to form in four distinct bodies,
and begin the attack, supported by the corps of Brigadier
Monckton, as soon as the other troops should have passed
the ford, and be near enough to contribute their assist∣ance.
These instructions, however, were entirely ne∣glected.
Before Mr. Monckton had landed, and while
Brigadier Townshend was on his march at a considerable
distance, the grenadiers, without waiting to be drawn up
in any regular form, impetuously rushed towards the ene∣my's
entrenchments in the utmost disorder. Their cou∣rage
served only to increase their misfortune. The first
fire they received did such execution among them, that
they were obliged to shelter themselves under the redoubt
which the French had abandoned at their approach. In
this uncomfortable situation they remained some time,
unable to form under so hot a fire, notwithstanding the ut∣most
efforts of many gallant officers, who lavishly ex∣posed,
and even lost their lives in the honourable discharge
of their duty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following anecdote is so remarkable, and tends so much to the honour of the British soldiery, that we insert it without seat of the reader's disapprobation:—Captain Och<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erlony and Ensign Peyton belonged to the regiment of Brigadier-General Monckton. They were nearly of an age, which did not exceed thirty; the first was a North-Briton, the other a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Ireland. Both were agreeable in person, and unblemished in chara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and connected together by the ties of mutual friendship and esteem. On the day that preceded the battle, Captain Ochterlony had been obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> duel with a German officer; in which, though he wounded and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> antagonist, yet he himself received a dangerous hurt under the right <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consequence of which his friends insisted on his remaining in camp <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the action of next day; but his spirit was too great to comply with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> monstrance. He declared it should never be said that a scratch received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> private rencounter had prevented him from doing his duty, when his coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> required his service; and he took the field with a fusil in his hand, though he was hardly able to carry his arms. In leading up his men to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entrenchment, he was shot through the lungs with a musquet-ball, an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> dent which obliged him to part with his fusil: but he still continued a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vancing, until, by loss of blood, he became too weak to proceed farther. About the same time Mr. Peyton was lamed by a shot, which shattered the small bone of his left leg. The soldiers, in their retreat, earnestly begged, with tears in their eyes, that Captain Ochterlony would allow them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him and the ensign o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the field. But he was so bigotted to a severe point <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honour, that he would not quit the ground, though he desired they would take care of his ensign. Mr. Peyton, with a generous disdain, rejected their good o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, declaring that he would not leave his captain in such a situation; and in a little time they remained the sole survivors on that part of the field.</P>
<P>Captain Ochterlony sat down by his friend, and, as they expected nothing but immediate death, they took leave of each other; yet they were not alto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether abandoned by the hope of being protected as prisoners: for the capt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> seeing a French soldier with two Indians approach, started up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them in the French language, which he spoke perfectly well, expressed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expectation that they would treat him and his companion as officers, prisoner, and gentlemen. The two Indians seemed to be entirely under the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Frenchman, who coming up to Mr. Peyton, as he sat on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> snatched his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced hat from his head, and robbed the captain of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> money. This outrage was a signal to the Indians for murther and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> One of them, clubbing his firelock, struck at him behind, with a view to knock him down, but the blow missing his head, took place upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> At the same instant the other Indian po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red his shot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unfortunate young gentleman, who cried out, “O Peyton! the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shot me.” Not yet satiated with cruelty, the barbarian sprung upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and stabbed him in the belly with his scalping knife. The captain, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with his fusi, had no weapon for his defence, as none of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wore swords in the action. The three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>russians, finding him still alive, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deavoured to strangle him with his own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and he was now upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> struggling against them with surprising exertion. Mr. Peyton, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> juncture, having a double barrelled mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quet in his hand, and seeing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his friend, fired at one of the Indians, who dropped dead upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The other, thinking the ensign would now be an easy prey, advanced towards him, and Mr. Peyton, having taken good aim at the distance of four yards, discharged his piece the second time, but it seemed to take no effect. The savage fired in his turn, and wounded the ensign in the shoulder; then rush∣ing upon him, thrust his bayonet through his body. He repeated the blow, which Mr. Peyton attempting to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, received another wound in his left hand, nevertheless he seised the Indian's musket with the same hand, pulled him forwards, and with his right drawing a dagger which hung by his side, plunged it in the barbarian's side. A violent struggle ensued: but at length Mr. Peyton was uppermost, and, with repeated strokes of his dagger, killed his antagonist outright. Here he was seised with an unaccountable emotion of curiosity, to know whether or not his shot had taken place on the body of the Indian; he accordingly turned him up, and stripping off his blanket, per∣ceived that the ball had penetrated quite through the cavity of the breast. Having thus obtained a dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-bought victory, he started up on one leg, and saw Capain Ochterlony standing at the distance of sixty-yards, close by the enemy's breast work, with the French soldier attending him. Mr. Peyton then called aloud, “Captain Ochterlony, I am glad to see you have at last got under protection. Beware of that villain, who is more barbarous than the savages. God bless you, my dear Captain. I see a party of Indians coming this way, and expect to be murthered immediately.” A number of those barbarians had for some time been employed on the left in scalping and pillaging the dying and the dead that were left upon the field of battle; and above thirty of them were in full march to destroy Mr. Peyton. This gentleman knew he had no mercy to expect: for, should his life be spared for the present, they would have afterwards insisted upon sacrificing him to the manes of their brethren whom he had slain: and in that case he would have been put to death by the most excruciating tortures. Full of this idea, he snatched up his musket, and, notwithstanding his broken leg, ran above forty yards without halting: feeling himself now totally disabled, and incapable of proceeding one slep farther, he loaded his piece, and presented it to the two foremost Indians, who stood aloof, waiting to be joined by their fellows: while the French, from their breast works, kept up a continual fire of can∣non and small arms upon this poor, so it a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, maimed gentleman. In this uncomfortable situation he stood, when he discerned at a distance a High∣land officer, with a party of his men, skirting the plain towards the field of battle. He forthwith waved his hand in signal of distress, and being per∣ceived by the officer, he detached three of his men to his assistance. These brave fellows hastened to him through the midst of a terrible fire, and one of them bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on his shoulders. The Highland officer was Captain Macdonald, of Colonel Frazier's battalion; who understanding that a young gentleman, his kinsman, had dropped on the field of battle, had put himself at the head of this party, with which he penetrated to the middle of the field, drove <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerable number of the French and Indians before him, and find∣ing his relation still unscalped, carried him off in triumph. Poor Captain Ochterlony was conveyed to Quebeck, where in a few days he died of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wounds. After the reduction of that place, the French surgeons who attended him declared, that, in all probability, he would have recovered of the two shots he had received in his breast, had not he been mortally wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the belly by the Indian's scalping knife.</P>
<P>As this very remarkable seene was acted in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of both armies, Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Townshend, in the sequel, expostulated with the French officers upon the inhumanity of keeping up such a severe fire against two wounded gentlemen▪ who were disabled, and destitute of all hope of escaping. They answered▪ that the fire was not made by the regulars, but by the Canadians and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom it was not in the power of discipline to restrain.</P></NOTE>. The general seeing all their endeavours

confusion, leaving a considerable number lying on the

the living, and scalped the dead, even in sight of
their indignant companions. This unhappy accident oc∣casioned
a new delay, and the day was already far ad∣vanced.
The wind began to blow with uncommon vio∣lence,
and the tide to make; so that, in case of a second
repulse, the retreat of Brigadier Townshend might have
been rendered hazardous and uncertain; Mr. Wolfe,
therefore, thought proper to desist, and returned without
further molestation to the other side of the river Montmo∣renci.
The Admiral ordered the two vessels which were
a-ground to be set on fire, that they might not fall into
the hands of the enemy, The advantages that favoured
an attack in this part consisted of the following particu∣lars:
All the artillery could be used with good effect; all
the troops could act at once; and, in case of a miscarriage,
the retreat was secure and open, at least for a certain
time of the tide. These, however, seemed to be over-balanced
by other considerations. The enemy were posted
on a commanding eminence; the beach was covered with
deep mud, slippery, and broken into holes and gullies;
the hill was steep, and in some places impracticable; the
enemy were numerous, and poured in a very severe fire
from their entrenchments. Had the attack succeeded, the
loss of the English must have been very heavy, and that
of the French inconsiderable, because the neighbouring
woods afforded them immediate shelter; finally, the
river St. Charles still remained to be passed, before the
town could be invested.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50"/>
§ XXIII. Immediately after this mortifying check, in
which above five hundred men, and many brave officers,
were lost, the General detached Brigadier Murray, with
twelve hundred men, in transports, above the town, to
co-operate with Rear-Admiral Holmes, whom the ad∣miral
had sent up with some force against the French
shipping, which he hoped to destroy. The Brigadier was
likewise instructed to seise every opportunity of fighting
the enemy's detachments, and even of provoking them tobattle. In pursuance of these directions, he twice attempt∣ed
to land on the north shore; but these attempts were
unsuccessful. The third effort was more fortunate. He
made a sudden descent at Chambaud, and burned a consi∣derable
magazine, filled with arms, clothing, provision,
and ammunition. The enemy's ships being secured in
such a manner as not to be approached, and nothing else
occuring that required the brigadier's longer stay, he re∣turned
to the camp, with intelligence obtained from his
prisoners, that the fort of Niagara was taken, Crown-Point
abandoned, and General Amherst employed in
making preparations to attack the corps at the Isleaux Noix
commanded by M. Burlemaque. The disaster at the
falls of Montmorenci made a deep impression on the mind
of General Wolfe▪ whose spirit was too great to brook the
most distant prospect of censure or disgrace. He knew
the character of the English people, rash, impatient, and
capricious; elevated to exultation by the least gleam of
success, dejected even to despondency by the most inconsider∣able
frown of adverse fortune; sanguine even to childish
hyperbole in applauding those servants of the publick who
have prospered in their undertakings; clamorous to a degree
of persecution against those who have miscarried in their
endeavours, without any investigation of merit, without
any consideration of circumstances. A keen sense of these
vexatious peculiarities conspiring with shame of dis∣appointment,
an eager desire of retrieving the laurel that
he might by some be supposed to have lost at the falls of
Montmorenci, and the despair of finding such an oc∣casion,
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
excited an internal agitation, which visibly affected
his external frame, and disordered his whole constitution,
which was naturally delicate and tender. Among those
who shared his confidence, he was often seen to sigh; he
was often heard to complain, and even in the transports
of his chagrin declare, that he would never return with∣out
success, to be exposed, as other unfortunate command∣ers
had been, to the censure and reproach of an ignorant
and ungrateful populace. This tumult of the mind, ad∣ded
to the fatigues of body he had undergone, produced
a fever and dysentery; by which, for some time, he was
totally disabled.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. Before he recovered any degree of strength, he
desired the general officers to consult together for the pub∣lick
utility. It was their opinion, that the points of Levi
and Orleans being left in a proper state of defence, the
rest of the troops should be conveyed up the river; with a
view to draw the enemy from their present situation, and
bring them if possible to an engagement. This measure,
however, was not adopted, until the General and Admiral
had reconnoitred the town of Quebeck, with a view to a
general assault, and concluded from their own observations,
re-enforced by the opinion of the chief engineer, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the interiors of the place,
that such an attack could not be hazarded with any pros∣pect
of success. The ships of war, indeed, might have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilenced the batteries of the lower town; but they could
not affect the upper-works, from which they must have
sustained considerable damage. When we consider the
situation of this place, and the fortifications with which it
was secured, the natural strength of the country; the great
number of vessels and sloating batteries they had provided
for the defence of the river; the skill, valour, superio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
force, and uncommon vigilance of the enemy; their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣merous
bodies of savages continually hovering about the
posts of the English, to surprise parties and harrass detach∣ments;
we must own that there was such a combination of
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
difficulties as might have discouraged and perplexed the
most resolute and intelligent commander.</P>
<P>§ XXV. In consequence of the resolution taken to quit
the camp at Montmorenci, the troops and artillery were
re-embarked, and landed at Point Levi: they afterwards
passed up the river in transports, while Admiral Holmes
made a movement with his ships, to amuse the enemy
posted on the north shore: and the men being much
crowded on board, the General ordered one half of them
to be landed for refreshment on the other side of the ri∣ver.
As no possibility appeared of annoying the enemy
above the town, the scheme of operations was totally
changed. A plan was formed for conveying the troops
farther down in boats, and landing them in the night
within a league of Cape Diamond, in hopes of ascending
the heights of Abraham, which rise abruptly, with a steep
ascent, from the banks of the river, that they might take
possession of the ground on the back of the city, where it
was but indifferently fortified. The dangers and difficul∣ties
attending the execution of this design were so peculi∣arly
discouraging, that one would imagine it could not
have been embraced but by a spirit of enterprise that border∣ed
on desperation. The stream was rapid; the shore shelving;
the bank of the river lined with sentinels; the landing
place so narrow as to be easily missed in the dark; and the
ground so difficult as hardly to be surmounted in the day∣time,
had no opposition been expected. If the enemy had
received the least intimation from spy or deserter, or even
suspected the scheme: had the embarkation been disorder∣ed,
in consequence of the darkness of the night, the rapidity of
the river, or the shelving nature of the north shore, near
which they were obliged to row: had one sentinel been
alarmed, or the landing-place much mistaken, the heighths
of Abraham must have been instantly secured by such a
force as would have rendered the undertaking abortive:
consusion would necessarily have ensued in the dark; and
this would have naturally produced a panick, which
might have proved fatal to the greater part of the detach∣ment
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
These objections could not escape the penetration
of the gallant Wolfe, who, nevertheless, adopted the
plan without hesitation; and even executed it in person;
though at that time labouring under a severe dysentery and
fever, which had exhausted his constitution, and reduced
him almost to an extremity of weakness. The previous
steps being taken, and the time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixed for this hazardous
attempt, Admiral Holmes moved with his squadron farther
up the river, about three leagues above the place appoint∣ed
for the disembarkation, that he might deceive the ene∣my,
and amuse M. de Bougainville, whom Montcalm
had detached with fifteen hundred men to watch the mo∣tions
of that squadron; but the English admiral was di∣rected
to fall down the river in the night, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as to protect
the landing of the forces; and these orders he punctually
fulfilled. On the twelfth day of September, an hour after
midnight, the first embarkation, consisting of four com∣plete
regiments, the light infantry, commanded by Colo∣nel
Howe, a detachment of Highlanders, and the Ameri∣can
grenadiers, was made in flat-bottomed boats, under
the immediate command of the Brigadiers Monckton and
Murray; though General Wolfe accompanied them in
person, and was among the first who landed; and they
began to fall down with the tide, to the intended place of
disembarkation; rowing close to the northshore, in order
to find it the more easily. Without any disorder the boats
glided gently along; but by the rapidity of the tide, and
the darkness of the night, the boats overshot the mark,
and the troops landed a little below the place at which the
disembarkation was intended.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How far the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attempt depended upon accident may be con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ived from the following particulars:—In the t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wilight two French de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were carried on board a ship of war, commanded by Captain Smith, and fying at anchor near the north shore. They told him, that the garrison o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Quebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, expected that night to receive a convoy of provisions, sent down the river in boat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, from the detachment above, commanded by M. de Bon∣gainville. These <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> standing upon deck, and perceiving the English boats with the troops gliding down the river in the dark, began to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and make a noise, declaring they were part of the expected convoy. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Smith, who was ignorant of General Wolfe's design, believing their affirmation, had actually given orders to point the guns at the British troops▪ when the General perceiving a commotion on board, rowed along-side in per∣son, and prevented the discharge, which would have alarmed the town, and entirely frustrated the attempt.</P>
<P>The French had posted sentries along shore, to challenge boats and vessels, and give the alarm occasionally. The first boat that contained the English troops being questioned accordingly, a captain of Fraser's regiment, who had served in Holland, and who was perfectly well acquainted with the French language and customs, answered without hesitation to <HI>Qui vit,</HI> which is their challenging word, <HI>la France:</HI> nor was be at a loss to answer the second question, which was much more particular and difficult. When the sentinel demanded <HI>a quel regiment?</HI> to what regiment? the captain replied, <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which he knew, by accident, to be one of those that composed the body com∣manded by Bougainville. The soldier took it for granted this was the ex∣pected convoy; and saying <HI>passe,</HI> allowed all the boats to proceed without further question. In the same manner, the other sentries were deceived; though one, more wary than the rest, came running down to the water's edge, and called, “<HI>pourquoy est que veus ne <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plus haut?</HI> Why don't you speak with an audible voice?” To this interogation, which implied doubt, the captain answered, with admitable presence of mind, in a soft tone of voice, “<HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tot, nous serons entendue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</HI> Hush! we shall be overheard and discovered.” Thus cautioned, the sentry retired without further alter∣cation. The midshipman who piloted the first boat, passing by the landing place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the dark, the same captain, who knew it, from his having been posted formerly with his company on the other side of the river, insisted upon the pilot's being mistaken, and commanded the rowers to put ashore in the proper place, or at least very near it.</P>
<P>When General Wolfe landed, and saw the difficulty of ascending the pre∣cip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, he said to the same officer, in a familiar strain, “I don't believe there is any possibility of getting up; but you must do your endeavour.” The narrow path that slanted up the hill from the landing place the enemy had broken up and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endered impassable by cross ditches, besides the entrenchament at the top: in every other part the hill was to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leep and dangerous, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the soldiers were obliged to pull themselves up by the roots and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> growing on both sides of the path.</P></NOTE> A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the troops landed,
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
the boats were sent back for the second embarkation,
which was superintended by Brigadier Townshend. In
the mean time, Colonel Howe, with the light infantry
and the Highlanders, ascended the woody precipices with
admirable courage and activity; and dislodged a serjeant's
guard, which defended a small entrenched narrow path,
by which alone the rest of the forces could reach the sum∣mit.
Then they mounted, without further molestation
from the enemy, and the general drew them up in order
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
as they arrived. Monsieur de Montcalm no sooner under∣stood
that the English had gained the heighths of Abraham,
which in a manner commanded the town on its weakest
part, than he resolved to hazard a battle, and began his
march without delay, after having collected his whole
force from the side of Beauport.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. General Wolfe, perceiving the enemy
crossing the river St. Charles, began to form his own line,
which consisted of six battalions, and the Louisbourg
grenadiers; the right commanded by Brigadier Monck∣ton,
and the left by Brigadier Murray: to the rear of the
left Colonel Howe was posted with his light infantry,
just returned from a four-gun battery, which they had
taken without opposition. M. de Montcalm advancing
in such a manner as to shew his intention was to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank
the left of the English, Brigadier Townshend was sent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hither with the regiment of Amherst, which he formed
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> presenting a double front to the enemy: he was
afterwards re-enforced by two battalions, and the reserve
consisted of one regiment drawn up in eight sub-divisions,
with large intervals. The right of the enemy was com∣posed
of half the colony troops, two battalions, and a body
of Canadians and savages: their centre consisted of a column,
formed by two other regular battalions; and on the left
one battalion, with the remainder of the colony troops,
was posted: the bushes and corn-fields in their front were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with fifteen hundred of their best marksmen, who
kept up an irregular galling fire, which proved fatal to
many brave officers, thus singled out for destruction. This
fire, indeed, was in some measure checked by the advanced
posts of the British line, who piqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered with the enemy
for some hours before the battle began. Both armies were
destitute of artillery, except two small pieces on the side
of the French, and a single gun, which the English seamen
had made shift to draw up from the landing-place. This
was very well served, and galled their column severely. At
length, about nine in the morning, the enemy advanced to
the charge with great order and vivacity, though their
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
fire was irregular and ineffectual. On the contrary, the
British forces reserved their shot until the French had ap∣proached
within forty yards of their line; then they poured
in a terrible discharge, and continued the fire with such
deliberation and spirit, as could not fail to produce a very
considerable effect. General Wolfe was stationed on the
right, at the head of Bragg's regiment and the Louisbourg
grenadiers, where the attack was most warm. As he stood
conspicuous in the front of the line, he had been aimed at
by the enemy's marksmen, and received a shot in the wrist,
which, however, did not oblige him to quit the field.
Having wrapped a handkerchief round his hand, he con∣tinued
giving orders without the least emotion, and ad∣vanced
at the head of the grenadiers, with their bayonets
fixed, when another ball unfortunately pierced the breast
of this young hero<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the fatal ball took place, General Wolfe, finding himself unable to stand, leaned upon the shoulder of a lieutenant, who sat down for that purpose. This officer seeing the French give way, exclaimed, “They run! they run!”—“Who run?” cried the gallant Wolfe, with great eagerness. When the lieutenant replied, “The French.”—“What! (said he) do the cowards run already? then I die happy.” So saying, the glorious youth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pirc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</NOTE>, who fell in the arms of victory, just
as the enemy gave way. At this very instant, every sepa∣rate
regiment of the British army seemed to exert itself for
the honour of its own peculiar character. While the right
pressed on with their bayonets, Brigadier Murray briskly
advanced with the troops under his command, and soon
broke the centre of the enemy: then the Highlanders,
drawing their broad swords, fell in among them with irre∣sistible
impetuosity, and drove them with great slaughter
into the town, and the works they had raised at the bridge
of the river St. Charles. On the left and rear of the Eng∣lish,
the action was not so violent. Some of the light in∣fantry
had thrown themselves into houses, where, being at∣tacked,
they defended themselves with great courage and
resolution. Colonel Howe having taken post with two
companies behind a small copse, sallied out frequently on
the slanks of the enemy, during this attack, and often
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
drove them into heaps; while Brigadier Townshend ad∣vanced
platoons against their front: so that the right
wing of the French were totally prevented from executing
their first intention. The Brigadier himself remained with
Amherst's regiment, to support this disposition, and
to over-awe a body of savages, posted opposite to the
light infantry, waiting for an opportunity to fall up∣on
the rear of the British army. General Wolfe be∣ing
slain, and, at the same time, Mr. Monckton dan∣gerously
wounded at the head of Lascelles's regiment,
where he distinguished himself with remarkable gallantry,
the command devolved on Brigadier Townshend, who
hastened to the centre, and finding the troops disordered
in the pursuit, formed them again with all possible expe∣dition.
This necessary task was scarce performed, when
M. de Bougainville, with a body of two thousand fresh
men, appeared in the rear of the English. He had begun
his march from Cape Rouge as soon as he received intelli∣gence
that the British troops had gained the heighhts of
Abraham, but did not come up in time to have any share
in the battle. Mr. Townshend immediately ordered two
battalions, with two pieces of artillery, to advance against
this officer, who retired at their approach, among woods
and swamps, where General Townshend very wisely de∣clined
hazarding a precarious attack. He had already ob∣tained
a complete victory, taken a great number of French
officers, and was possessed of a very advantageous situation,
which it would have been imprudent to forego. The
French General, M. de Montcalm, was mortally wounded
in the battle, and conveyed into Quebeck, from whence,
before he died, he wrote a letter to General Townshend,
recommending the prisoners to that generous humanity by
which the British nation is distinguished. His second in
command was le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t wounded on the field, and next day ex∣pired
on board an English ship, to which he had been con∣veyed.
About one thousand of the enemy were made pri∣soners,
including a great number of officers, and about five
hundred were slain on the field of battle. The wreck of
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
their army, after they had re-enforced the garrison of Que∣beck,
retired to Point-au-Tremble, from whence they pro∣ceeded
to Jaques Quartiers, where they remained en∣trenched,
until they were compelled by the severity of the
weather to make the best of their way to Trois Rivieres
and Montreal. This important victory was obtained at
the expense of fifty men killed, including nine officers;
and about five hundred men wounded; but the death of
General Wolfe was a national loss, universally lamented.
He inherited from nature an animating fervour of senti∣ment,
an intuitive perception, an extensive capacity, and
a passion for glory, which stimulated him to acquire every
species of military knowledge that study could compre∣hend,
that actual service could illustrate and confirm.
This noble warmth of disposition seldom fails to call forth
and unfold the liberal virtues of the soul. Brave above
all estimation of danger, he was also generous, gentle, com∣placent,
and humane; the pattern of the officer, the darling
of the soldier: there was a sublimity in his genius, which
soared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his
faculties been exercised to their full extent by opportu∣nity
and action; had his judgment been fully matured by
age and experience, he would, without doubt, have ri∣valled
in reputation the most celebrated captains of an∣tiquity.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. Immediately after the battle of Quebeck,
Admiral Saunders, who, together with his subordinates,
Durell and Holmes, had all along co-operated heartily
with the land forces for the advantage of the service, sent
up all the boats of the fleet, with artillery and ammu∣nition;
and on the seventeenth day of the Month sailed
up, with all the ships of war, in a disposition to attack the
lower town, while the upper part should be assaulted by
General Townshend. This gentleman had employed the
time from the day of action in securing the camp with re∣doubts,
in forming a military road for the cannon, in draw∣ing
up the artillery, preparing batteries, and cutting off
the enemy's communication with the country. On the
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
seventeenth, before any battery could be finished, a flag
of truce was sent from the town, with proposals of capitu∣lation;
which, being maturely considered by the general
and admiral, were accepted, and signed at eight next morn∣ing.
They granted the more favourable terms, as the
enemy continued to assemble in the rear of the British ar∣my;
as the season was become wet, stormy, and cold;
threatening the troops with sickness, and the sleet with ac∣cident,
and as a considerable advantage would result from
taking possession of the town while the walls were in a
state of desence. What rendered the capitulation still
more fortunate for the British general, was the information
he afterwards received from deserters, that the enemy had
rallied, and were re-enforced behind Cape Rouge, under
the command of M. de Levy, arrived from Montreal for
that purpose, with two regular battalions; and that M.
de Bougainville, at the head of eight hundred men, with
a convoy of provisions, was actually on his march to
throw himself into the town on the eighteenth, that very
morning on which it was surrendered. The place was
not then completely invested, as the enemy had broke
their bridge of boats, and posted detachments in very strong
works, on the other side of the river St. Charles. The
capitulation was no sooner ratified than the British forces
took possession of Quebeck on the land side, and guards
were posted in different parts of the town, to preserve
order and discipline: at the same time, Captain Palliser,
with a body of seamen, entered the lower town, and took
the same precautions. Next day, about a thousand pri∣soners
were embarked on board transports, which pro∣ceeded
to France with the first opportunity. Mean while,
the inhabitants of the country crme in great numbers, to
deliver up their arms, and take the oath of fidelity to the
English government. The death of Montcalm, which
was indeed an irreparable loss to France, in all probability,
overwhelmed the enemy with consternation, and con∣founded
all their councils; otherwise we cannot account
for the tame surrender of Quebeck to a handful of
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
troops, even after the victory they had obtained: for al∣though
the place was not regularly fortified on the land
side, and most of the houses were in ruins, their walls and
parapets had not yet sustained the least damage: the be∣siegers
were hardly sufficient to complete the investiture:
a fresh army was assembled in the neighbourhood, with
which their communication continued open: the season
was so far advanced, that the British forces in a little time
must have been forced to desist by the severity of the wea∣ther,
and even retire with their fleet before the approach
of winter, which never fails to freeze up the river St.
Laurence.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Immediately after the action at the falls of
Montmorenci, General Wolfe had dispatched an officer to
England, with a detail of that disaster, written with such
elegance and accuracy, as would not have disgraced the
pen of a Caesar. Though the publick acquiesced in his
conduct, they were exceeding mortified at his miscarriage;
and this mortification was the greater, as he seemed to
despair of being able to strike any other stroke of impor∣tance
for the accomplishment of their hope, which had
aspired at the absolute conquest of Canada. The first
transports of their chagrin were not yet subsided, when
Colonel Hale arrived in the ship Alcide, with an account
of the victory and surrender of Quebeck; which was im∣mediately
communicated to the people in an extraordinary
gazette. The joy which this excited among the populace
rose in proportion to the despondence which the former
had produced: all was rapture and riot; all was triumph
and exultation, mingled with the praise of the all accom∣plished
Wolfe, which they exalted to a ridiculous degree
of hyperbole. The King expressed his satisfaction, by
conferring the honour of knighthood upon Captain Doug∣las,
whose ship brought the first tidings of this success;
and gratified him and Colonel Hale with considerable
presents. A day of solemn thanksgiving was appointed
by proclamation through all the dominions of Great-Britain.
The city of London, the universities, and many
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
other corporations of the kingdom, presented congratu∣latory
addresses to his Majesty. The parliament was no
sooner assembled, than the secretary of state, in the House
of Commons, expatiated on the successes of the campaign,
the transcendant merit of the deceased general, the con∣duct
and courage of the Admirals and officers who assist∣ed
in the conquest of Quebeck. In consequence of this
harangue, and the motion by which it was succeeded,
the House unanimously resolved to present an address,
desiring his Majesty would order a monument to be erected
in Westminster-Abbey to the memory of Major-General
Wolfe: at the same time, they passed another resolution,
that the thanks of the House should be given to the sur∣viving
generals and admirals employed in the glorious
and successful expedition to Quebeck. Testimonies of
this kind, while they reflect honour upon the character
of the nation, never fail to animate individuals to a spi∣rited
exertion of their talents in the service of the publick.
The people of England were so elevated by the astonish∣ing
success of this campaign, which was also prosperous on
the continent of Europe, that far from expressing the least
sense of the enormous burthens which they bore, they,
with a spirit peculiar to the British nation, voluntarily
raised large contributions, to purchase warm jackets,
stockings, shoes, coats, and blankets, for the soldiers
who were exposed to the rigours of an inclement sky in
Germany and America. But they displayed a more noble
proof of unrestrained benevolence extended even to fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.
The French ministry, straitened in their finances, which
were found scarce sufficient to maintain the war, had sacri∣ficed
their duty to their king, and every sentiment of com∣passion
for his unhappy subjects, to a thirst of vengeance,
and sanguinary views of ambition. They had withdrawn
the usual allowance from their subjects who were detained
prisoners in England; and those wretched creatures,
amounting in number to near twenty thousand, were left
to the mercy of those enemies whom their sovereign had
taken such pains to exasperate. The allowance with which
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
they were indulged by the British government effectually
secured them from the horrors of famine; but still they
remained destitute of other conveniencies, and particularly
exposed to the miseries of cold and nakedness. The gene∣rous
English beheld these forlorn captives with sentiments
of sympathy and compassion: they considered them as
their fellow-creatures and brethren in humanity, and for∣got
their country while they beheld their distress. A con∣siderable
subscription was raised in their behalf; and in a
few weeks they were completely clothed by the charity of
their British benefactors. This beneficent exertion was
certainly one of the noblest triumph's of the human mind,
which even the most inveterate enemies of Great Britain
cannot but regard with reverence and admiration. The
city of Quebeck being reduced, together with great part of
the circumjacent country, Brigadier Townshend, who
had accepted his commission with the express proviso that
he should return to England at the end of the campaign,
left a garrison of five thousand effective men, victualled
from the fleet, under the command of Brigadier Murray;
and embarking with admiral Saunders, arrived in Great
Britain about the beginning of winter. As for Brigadier
Monckton, he was conveyed to New-York, where he
happily recovered of his wound.</P>

<P>§ I. WHILE the arms of Great-Britain triumphed
in Europe and America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> her interest was not
suffered to languish in other parts of the world. This
was the season of ambition and activity, in which every
separate armament, every distinct corps, and every indi∣vidual
officer, seemed to exert themselves with the most
eager appetite of glory. The East-Indies, which, in the
course of the preceding year, had been the theatre of
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
operations carried on with various success, exhibited no∣thing
now but a succession of trophies to the English com∣manders.
The Indian transactions of the last year we
interrupted at that period when the French general, Lally,
was employed in making preparations for the siege of Ma∣dras.
In the month of October he had marched into
Arcot without opposition; and, in the beginning of De∣cember,
he advanced towards Madras. On the twelfth
he marched over Choultry plain, in three divisions, can∣nonaded
by the English artillery with considerable e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ect,
and took post at Egmore and St. Thome. Colonel Lau∣rence,
who commanded the garrison of Madras, retired to
the island, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prevent the enemy from taking pos∣session
of the island bridge, and at the same time ordered the
posts to be occupied in the Black-town or suburbs of Ma∣dras.
In the morning of the fourteenth, the enemy march∣ing
with their whole force to attack this place, the English
detachments retreated into the garrison, and within the
hour a grand sally was made, under the command of
Colonel Draper, a gallant officer, who signalised himself
remarkably on this occasion. He attacked the regiment of
Lorraine with great impetuosity; and, in all probability,
would have beat them off, had they not been sustained by
the arrival of a fresh brigade. After a very warm dispute,
in which many officers, and a great number of men, were
killed on each side, Colonel Draper was obliged to re∣treat,
not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his
grenadiers. As the garrison of Madras was not very nu∣merous,
nothing further was attempted on their side with∣out
the works. In the mean time, the enemy used all their
diligence in erecting batteries against the fort and
town, which being opened on the sixth day of January,
they maintained a continued discharge of shot and shells
for twenty days, advancing their trenches all the time under
cover of this fire, until they reached the breast of the glacis.
There they erected a battery of four pieces of cannon, and
opened it on the last day of the month; but for five days
successively they were obliged to close their embrasures,
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
by the superior fire of the fort, and at length to abandon it
entirely; nevertheless, they still maintained a severe fire
from the first grand battery, which was placed at the
distance of four hundred and fifty yards from the defences.
This artillery was so well served, as to disable twenty six
pieces of cannon, three mortars, and effect an inconsider∣able
breach. Perhaps they might have had more success,
had they battered in breach from the beginning; but
M. Lally, in order to intimidate the inhabitants, had
cruelly bombarded the town, and demolished the houses:
he was, however, happily disappointed in his expectation
by the wise and resolute precautions of Governour Pigot:
by the vigilance, conduct, and bravery of the Colonels
Laurence and Draper, seconded by the valour and activity
of Major Brereton, and the spirit of the inferior officers.
The artillery of the garrison was so well managed, that,
from the fifth day of February, the fire of the enemy
gradually decreased from twenty-three to six pieces of can∣non:
nevertheless, they advanced their sap along the sea∣side,
so as to embrace entirely the north-east angle of the
covered way, from whence their musquetry drove the be∣sieged.
They likewise endeavoured to open a passage into
the ditch by a mine, but sprung it so injudiciously, that
they could make no advantage of it, as it lay exposed to
the fire of several cannon. While these preparations were
carried on before the town, Major Caillaud and Captain
Preston, with a body of Sipoys, some of the country horse,
and a few Europeans, drawn from the English garrisons
of Trichenapally and Chingalaput, hovered at the distance
of a few miles, blocking up the roads in such a manner,
that the enemy were obliged, four several times, to send
large detachments against them, in order to open the com∣munication:
thus the progress of the siege was in a great
measure retarded. On the sixteenth day of February in
the evening, the Queenborough ship of war commanded
by Captain Kempenfeldt, and the company's ship the Re∣venge,
arrived in the road of Madras, with a re-enforce∣ment
of six hundred men belonging to Colonel Draper's
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
regiment, and part of them was immediately disembarked.
From the beginning of the siege, the enemy had discovered
a backwardness in the service very unsuitable to their
national character. They were ill supplied by their com∣missaries
and contractors: they were discouraged by the
obstinate defence of the garrison, and all their hope of suc∣cess
vanished at the arrival of this re-enforcement. After
a brisk fire, they raised the siege that very night, abandon∣ing
forty pieces of cannon; and, having destroyed the
powder-mills at Ogmore, retreated to the territory of
Arcot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chagrin and mortification of Lally are strongly marked in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lowing intercepted letter to M. de Legret, dated from the camp <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Madras: “A good blow might be struck here; there is a ship in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> twenty guns, laden with all the riches of Madras, which it is said will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> main there till the 20th.

§ II. M. Lally having weakened his forces that were at
Masulipatam, under the conduct of the Marquis de Con∣ans,
in order to strengthen the army with which he un∣dertook
the siege of Madras, the Rajah of Visanapore
drove the French garrison from Vizagapatam, and hoisted
English colours in the place. The Marquis having put
his troops in motion to revenge this insult, the Rajah
sollicited succour from Colonel Clive at Calcutta; and,
with the consent of the council, a body of troops was sent,
under the command of Colonel Forde, to his assistance.
They consisted of five hundred Europeans, including a
company of artillery, and sixteen hundred sipoys, with
about fifteen pieces of cannon, one howitzer, and three
mortars. The forces of Conflans were much more con∣siderable.
On the twentieth day of October, Colonel
Forde arrived at Vizagapatam, and made an agreement
with the Rajah, who promised to pay the expense of the
expedition, as soon as he should be put in possession of
Rajamundry, a large town and fort possessed by the
French. It was stipulated that he should have all the in∣land
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
country belonging to the Indian powers in the French
interest, and at present in arms; and that the English com∣pany
should retain all the conquered sea-coast from Viza∣gapatam
to Masulipatam. On the first day of November
Colonel Forde proceeded on his march, and on the third
joined the Rajah's army, consisting of between three and
four thousand men. On the third day of December they
came in fight of the enemy, near the village of Tallapool:
but the French declining battle, the Colonel determined
to draw them from their advantageous situation, or march
round, and get between them and Rajamundry. On the
seventh, before day-break, he began his march, leaving
the Rajah's forces on their ground; but the enemy be∣ginning
to cannonade the Indian forces, he, at the request
of the Rajah, returned, and took them under his pro∣tection.
Then they marched together to the village of
Golapool, and halted on a small plain about three miles from
their encampment. About nine he formed the line of bat∣tle.
About ten the enemy were drawn up, and began the
cannonade. The firing on both sides having continued
about forty minutes, the enemy's line advanced to the
charge with great resolution, and were so warmly received,
that after several spirited efforts, at eleven they gave way,
and retreated in disorder towards Rajamundry. During
this conflict, the Rajah's forces stood as idle spectators;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or could their horse be prevailed upon to pursue the fugi∣tives.
This victory cost the English forty-four Europeans
killed and wounded, including two captains and three
lieutenants. The French lost above three times the num∣ber,
together with their whole camp, baggage, thirty-two
pieces of cannon, and all their ammunition. A great num∣ber
of black forces fell on both sides. The Marquis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lans did not remain at Rajamundry, but proceeded to
Masulipatam; while Captain Knox, with a detachment
from the English army, took possession of the sort of Raja∣mundry,
which is the barrier and key to the country of
Vizagapatam. This was delivered to the Rajah on his
paying the expense of the expedition; and Captain Knox
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
being detached with a battalion of sipoys, took possession of
the French factory at Narsipore. This was also the fate
of a small fort at Coucate, which surrendered to Cap∣tain
Maclean, after having made an obstinate defence.
In the mean time, however, the French army of observa∣tion
made shift to retake Rajamundry, where they found
a considerable quantity of money, baggage, and effects be∣longing
to English officers.</P>
<P>§ III. Colonel Forde advancing to the neighbourhood
of Masulipatam, the Marquis de Conflans with his forces
retired within the place, which on the seventh day of
March was invested. By the seventh day of April the
ammunition of the besiegers being almost expended, Col.
Forde determined to give the assault, as two breaches
were already made, and made his disposition accordingly.
The attack was begun in the night, and the assailants ar∣rived
at the ditch before they were discovered. But here they
under went a terrible discharge of grape-shot and musquetry;
notwithstanding which they entered the breaches, and drove
the enemy from bastion to bastion. At length, the Mar∣quis
de Conflans sent an officer to demand quarter for the
garrison, which was granted as soon as he ordered his men
to cease firing. Thus, with about three hundred and
forty European soldiers, a handful of seamen, and seven
hundred sipoys, Colonel Forde took by assault the strong
town of Masulipatam, garrisoned by five hundred and
twenty-two Europeans, two thousand and thirty-nine
caffrees, topasses, and sipoys; and here he found above one
hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, with a great quantity
of ammunition. Salabatzing, the Subah of Decan, per∣ceiving
the success of the English here as well as at Ma∣dras,
being sick of his French alliance, and in dread of
his brother Nizam Allee, who had set up a separate in∣terest,
and taken the field against him, made advances to
the company, with which he forth with concluded a treaty
to the following effect:—“The whole of the circar of Ma∣sulipatam
shall be given to the English company. Sala∣batzing
will not suffer the French to have a settlement in
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
this country, nor keep them in his service, nor give them
any assistance. The English, on their part, will not assist,
nor give protection to the Subah's enemies.” In a few
days after Masulipatam was reduced, two ships arrived in
the road, with a re-enforcement of four hundred men to
the Marquis de Conflans; but understanding the fate of
the place, made the best of their way to Ganjam.</P>
<P>§ IV. The merchants residing at Surat, finding them∣selves
exposed to numberless dangers, and every species of
oppression, by the Sidee who commanded the castle, on
one hand, by the governor of the city on the other, and
by the Mahrattas, who had a claim to a certain share of
the revenue, made application to the English presidency at
Bombay, desiring they would equip an expedition for
taking possession of the castle and Tanka, and settle the
government of the city upon Pharafs Cawn, who had been
naib or deputy-governor under Meah Atchund, and re∣gulated
the police to the satisfaction of the inhabitants.
The presidency embraced the proposal: Admiral Pococke
spared two of his ships for this service. Eight hundred
and fifty men, artillery and infantry, with fifteen hundred
sipoys, under the command of Captain Richard Maitland,
of the royal regiment of artillery, were embarked on board
the company's armed vessels commanded by Captain Wat∣son,
who sailed on the ninth day of February. On the fif∣teenth,
they were landed at a place called Dentiloury,
about nine miles from Surat; and here they were encamp∣ed
for refreshment: in two days he advanced against the
French garden, in which a considerable number of the
Sidee's men were posted, and drove them from thence,
after a very obstinate dispute. Then he erected a battery,
from which he battered the wall in breach: but this me∣thod
appearing tedious, he called a council of war, com∣posed
of the land and sea-officers, and laid before them the
plan of a general attack, which was accordingly executed
next morning. The company's grab, and the bomb∣ketches,
being warped up the river in the night, were
ranged in a line of battle opposite to the Bundar, which
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
was the strongest fortification that the enemy possessed, and under the fire of these, the troops being landed, took
the Bundar by assault. The outward town being thus
gained, he forthwith began to bombard the inner town
and castle with such fury, that next morning they both
surrendered, on condition of being allowed to march
out with their effects; and Captain Maitland took posses∣sion
without further dispute. Meah Atchund was conti∣nued
governor of Surat, and Pharass Cawn was appointed
naib. The artillery and ammunition found in the castle
were secured for the company, until the Mogul's pleasure
was known; and in a little time a phirmaund, or grant,
arrived from Delhi, appointing the English company ad∣miral
to the Mogul; so that the ships and stores belonged
to them of course, as part of the Tanka; and they were
now declared legal possessors of the castle. This conquest,
which cost about two hundred men, including a few offi∣cers,
was atchieved with such expedition, that Captain
Watson returned to Bombay by the ninth day of April.</P>
<P>§ V. The main body of the English forces, which had
been centered at Madras, for the preservation of that im∣portant
settlement, took the sield after the siege was
raised, and possessed themselves of Conjeveram, a place of
great consequence, which, with the fort of Schengelpel,
commanded all the adjacent country, and secured the Bri∣tish
possessions to the northward. M. Lally, sensible of
the importance of the post, took the same route, in order
to dislodge them; but finding all his attempts ineffectual,
he retired towards Wandewash, where his troops were
put into quarters of cantonment. No other operations
ensued till the month of September, when Major Brereton,
who commanded the English forces, being joined by Ma∣jor
Gordon with three hundred men of Col. Coote's bat∣talion,
resolved to attack the enemy in his turn. On the
fourteenth day of the month he began his march from
Conjeveram for Wandewash, at the head of four hundred
Europeans, seven thousand sipoys, seventy European,
and three hundred black horse, with fourteen pieces
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
of artillery. In his march he invested and took the fort of
Trivitar, from whence he proceeded to the village of
Wandewash, where the French, to the number of one
thousand, were strongly encamped under the guns of a fort
commanded by a Rajah, mounting twenty cannon, under
the direction of a French gunner. On the thirtieth day
of September, at two in the morning, the English at∣tacked
the village in three different places, and drove them
from it after a very obstinate dispute; but this advantage
they were not able to maintain. The black pioneers ran
away during the attack, so that proper traverses could
not be made in the streets; and at day-break the fort
poured in upon them a prodigious discharge of grape-shot
with a considerable effect. The enemy had retired to a
dry ditch, which served as an entrenchment, from whence
they made furious sallies; and a body of three hundred
European horse were already in motion, to fall upon and
complete their confusion. In this emergency, they retired
in disorder, and might have been entirely ruined, had not
the body of reserve effectually covered their retreat; yet
this could not be effected without the loss of several offi∣cers,
and above three hundred men killed and wounded.
After this mortifying check, they encamped a few days
in sight of the fort, and the rainy season setting in, re∣turned
to Conjeveram. The fort of Wandewash was
afterwards garrisoned by French and sipoys, and the other
forces of the enemy were assembled by Brigadier-General
de Bussy at Arcot.</P>
<P>§ VI. During these transactions by land, the superiority
at sea was still disputed between the English and French
admirals. On the first day of September, Vice-Admiral
Pococke sailed from Madras to the southward, in quest of
the enemy; and next day descried the French fleet, con∣sisting
of fifteen sail, standing to the northward. He forth∣with
threw out the signal for a general chase, and stood
towards them with all the sail he could carry; but the
wind abating, he could not approach near enough to en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gage.
During the three succeeding days, he used his ut∣most
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
endeavours to bring them to a battle, which they
still declined, and at last they disappeared. He then di∣rected
his course to Pondicherry, on the supposition that
they were bound to that harbour; and on the eighth day
of the month perceived them standing to the southward:
but he could not bring them to an engagement till the
tenth, when M. d'Apch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, about two in the afternoon, made
the signal for battle, and the cannonading began without
further delay. The British squadron did not exceed nine
ships of the line; the enemy's fleet consisted of eleven; but
they had still a greater advantage in number of men and
artillery. Both squadrons fought with great impetuosity
till about ten minutes after four, when the enemy's rear
began to give way: this example was soon followed by
their centre; and finally the van, with the whole squa∣dron,
bore to the south-south-east, with all the canvas
they could spread. The British squadron was so much
damaged in their masts and rigging, that they could
not pursue; so that M. d'Apch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> retreated at his leisure un∣molested.
On the fifteenth, Admiral Pococke returned to
Madras, where his squadron being repaired by the twenty-sixth,
he sailed again to Pondicherry, and in the road saw
the enemy lying at anchor in line of battle. The wind
being off shore, he made the line of battle a-head, and
for some time continued in this situation. At length the
French admiral weighed anchor, and came forth; but
instead of bearing down upon the English squadron, which
had fallen to leeward, he kept close to the wind,
and stretched away to the southward. Admiral Pococke
finding him averse to another engagement, and his own
squadron being in no condition to pursue, he, with the
advice of his captains, desisted, and measured back his
course to Madras. On the side of the English, above
three hundred men were killed in the engagement, in∣cluding
Captain Miche, who commanded the Newcastle,
Captain Core of the marines, two lieutenants, a master,
gunner, and boatswain: the Captains Somerset and Brere∣ton,
with about two hundred and fifty men, were wound∣ed,
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
and many of the ships considerably damaged. The
loss of the enemy must have been much more considerable;
because the English in battle always fire at the body of the
ship; because the French squadron was crowded with
men; because they gave way, and declined a second en∣gagement;
and finally, because they now made the best
of their way to the island of Mauritius, in order to be re∣fitted,
having on board General Lally, and some other
officers. Thus they left the English masters of the Indian
coast; a superiority still more confirmed by the arrival of
Rear-Admiral Cornish, with four ships of the line, who
had set sail from England in the beginning of the year,
and joined Admiral Pococke at Madras on the eighteenth
day of October.</P>
<P>§ VII. The French were not the only enemies with
whom the English had to cope in the East-Indies. The
great extension of their trade in the kingdom of Bengal
had excited the envy and avarice of the Dutch factory,
who possessed a strong fort at Chinchura, on the river of
Bengal; and resolved, if possible, to engross the whole
salt-petre branch of commerce. They had, without doubt,
tampered with the new Subah, who lay under such obli∣gations
to the English, and probably secured his conni∣vance.
Their scheme was approved by the governor of
Batavia, who charged himself with the execution of it;
and, for that purpose, chose the opportunity when
the British squadron had retired to the coast of Ma∣labar.
On pretence of re-enforcing the Dutch garrisons
in Bengal, he equipped an armament of seven ships,
having on board five hundred European troops, and six
hundred Malayese under the command of Colonel Russel.
This armament having touched at Negapatam, proceeded
up the bay, and arrived in the river of Bengal about the
beginning of October. Colonel Clive, who then resided
at Calcutta, had received information of their design,
which he was resolved, at all events, to defeat. He com∣plained
to the Subah, who, upon such application, could
not decently refuse an order to the director and council of
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
Hughley, that this armament should not pro∣ceed
up the river. The Colonel, at the same time, sent a
letter to the Dutch commodore, intimating, that as he
had received intimation of their design, he could not allow
them to land forces, and march to Chinchura. In answer
to this declaration, the Dutch commodore, whose whole fleet
had not yet arrived, assured the English commander that
he had no intention to send any forces to Chinchura;
and begged liberty to land some of his troops for refresh∣ment;
a favour that was granted, on condition that they
should not advance. Notwithstanding the Subah's order,
and his own engagement to this effect, the rest of the ships
were no sooner arrived, than he proceeded up the river to
the neighbourhood of Tannah-fort, where his forces being
disembarked, began their march to Chinchura. In the
mean time, by way of retaliating the affront he pretended
to have sustained, in being denied a passage to their own
factory, he took several small vessels on the river belong∣ing
to the English company; and the Calcutta Indiaman,
commanded by Captain Wilson, homeward-bound, sailing
down the river, the Dutchman gave him to understand,
that if he presumed to pass he would sink him without
further ceremony. The English captain seeing them
run out their guns, as if really resolved to put their threats
in execution, returned to Calcutta, where two other In∣dia
ships lay at anchor, and reported his adventure to Co∣lonel
Clive, who forthwith ordered the three ships to pre∣pare
for battle, and attack the Dutch armament. The
ships being properly manned, and their quarters lined
with salt-petre, they fell down the river, and found the
Dutch squadron drawn up in line of battle, in order to
give them a warm reception, for which indeed they seemed
well prepared: for three of them were mounted with thir∣ty-six
guns each; three of them with twenty-six, and the
seventh carried sixteen. The Duke of Dorset, com∣manded
by Captain Forrester, being the first that ap∣proached
them, dropped anchor close to their line, and be∣gan
the engagement with a broadside, which was imme∣diately
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
returned. A dead calm unfortunately intervening,
this single ship was for a considerable time exposed to the
whole fire of the enemy; but a small breeze springing up,
the Calcutta and the Hardwicke advanced to her assistance,
and a severe fire was maintained on both sides, till two of
the Dutch ships, slipping their cables, bore away, and a
third was driven ashore. Their commodore thus weak∣ened,
after a few broadsides, struck his flag to Captain
Wilson, and the other three followed his example. The
victory being thus obtained, without the loss of one man
on the side of the English, Captain Wilson took possession
of the prizes, the decks of which were strewed with car∣nage,
and sent the prisoners to Colonel Clive, at Calcutta.
The detachment of troops which they had landed, to the
number of eleven hundred men, was not more fort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te
in their progress. Colonel Clive no sooner received intel∣ligence
that they were in full march to Chinchura than
he detached Colonel Forde, with five hundred men, from
Calcutta, in order to oppose, and put a stop to their march
at the French gardens. He accordingly advanced to the
northward, and entered the town of Chandernagore,
where he sustained the fire of a Dutch party sent out from
Chinchura to join and conduct the expected re-enforce∣ment.
These being routed and dispersed, after a short
action, Colonel Forde in the morning proceeded to a plain
in the neighbourhood of Chinchura, where he found the
enemy prepared to give him battle, on the twenty-fifth
day of November. They even advanced to the charge
with great resolution and activity; but found the fire of
the English artillery and battalion so intolerably hot, that
they soon gave way, and were totally defeated. A con∣siderable
number were killed, and the greater part of those
who survived the action were taken prisoners. During
this contest, the Nabob, at the head of a considerable army,
observed a suspicious neutrality; and in all likelihood
would have declared for the Dutch, had they proved
victorious, as he had reason to believe they would, from
their great superiority in number. But fortune no sooner
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
determined in favour of the English than he made a tender
of his service to the victor, and even offered to reduce
Chinchura with his own army. In the mean time, pro∣posals
of accommodation being sent to him by the directors
and council of the Dutch factory at Chinchura, a nego∣ciation
ensued, and a treaty was concluded to the satis∣faction
of all parties. Above three hundred of the pri∣soners
entered into the service of Great-Britain: the rest
embarked on board their ships, which were restored as
soon as the peace was ratified, and set out on their return
for Batavia. After all, perhaps, the Dutch company meant
nothing more than to put their factory of Chinchura on a
more respectable footing; and, by acquiring greater weight
and consequence among the people of the country than
they formerly possessed, the more easily extend their com∣merce
in that part of the world. At any rate, it will
admit of a dispute among those who profess the law of
nature and nations, whether the Dutch company could be
justly debarred the privilege of sending a re-enforcement
to their own garrisons. Be that as it will, the ships were
not restored until the factory at Chinchura had given se∣curity
to indemnify the English for the damage they had
sustained on this occasion.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The success of the English company was still
more conspicuous on the coast of Coromandel. The go∣vernour
and council of Madras having received informa∣tion,
that the French General Lally had sent a detachment
of his army to the southward, taken Syringham, and
threatned Trichenapally with a siege, it was determined
the Colonel Coo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who had lately arrived from England,
should take the field, and endeavour to make a diversion
to the southward. He accordingly began his march at the
head of seventeen hundred Europeans, including cavalry,
and three thousand blacks, with fourteen pieces of cannon
and one howitzer. On the twenty-seventh day of Novem∣ber
he invested the sort of Wandewash: having made a
practicable breach, the garrison, consisting of near nine
hundred men, surrendered prisoners of war; and he found
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
in the place forty-nine pieces of cannon, with a great
quantity of ammunition. Then he undertook the siege of
Carangoly, a fortress commanded by Colonel O'Kennely,
at the head of one hundred Europeans, and five hundred
sipoys. In a few days he dismounted the greater part of
their guns; and they submitted, on condition that the
Europeans should be allowed to march out with the ho∣nours
of war, but the sipoys were disarmed, and dis∣missed.</P>
<P>§ IX. General Lally, alarmed at the progress of this
brave, vigilant, and enterprising officer, assembled all his
forces at Arcot, to the number of two thousand two hun∣dred
Europeans, including horse, three hundred Caffres,
and ten thousand black troops, or sipoys, with five-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. Of these he assumed the com∣mand
in person; and on the tenth day of January began
his march, in order to recover Wandewash. Colonel
Coote, having received intelligence on the twelfth that he
had taken possession of Conjeveram, endeavoured by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
forced march to save the place, which they accordingly
abandoned at his approach, and pursuing their march <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Wandewash, invested the fort without delay. The Eng∣lish
commander passed the river Palla, in order to follow the
same route; and, on the twenty-first day of the month,
understanding that a breach was already made, resolved to
give them battle without further delay. The cavalry
being formed, and supported by five companies of sipoy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he advanced against the enemy's horse, which being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the same time galled by two pieces of cannon, retired with
precipitation. Then Colonel Coote, having taken pos∣session
of a tank which they had occupied, returned to the
line, which was by this time formed in order of battle▪
Seeing the men in high spirits, and eager to engage, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
ordered the whole army to advance, and by nine in the
morning they were within two miles of the enemy's camp▪
where they halted about half an hour. During this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣terval,
the Colonel reconnoitred the situation of the French
forces, who were very advantageously posted, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
movement to the right,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> which obliged them to alter their
disposition. They now advanced, in their turn, within
three quarters of a mile of the English line, and the can∣nonading
began with great fury on both sides. About
noon their European cavalry coming up with a resolute
air to charge the left of the English, Colonel Coote brought
up some companies of sipoys, and two pieces of cannon,
to sustain the horse, which were ordered to oppose them,
and these advancing on their flank, disturbed them so
much, that they broke, and were driven by the English
cavalry above a mile from the left, upon the rear of their
own army. Mean while, both lines continued advancing
to each other, and about one o'clock the firing with small
arms began with great vivacity. One of the French
tumbrils being blown up by an accidental shot, the Eng∣lish
commander took immediate advantage of their confu∣sion.
He ordered Major Brereton to wheel Draper's re∣giment
to the left, and fall upon the enemy's flank. This
service was performed with such resolution and success,
that the left wing of the French was completely routed,
and fell upon their centre, now closely engaged with the
left of the English. About two in the afternoon their
whole line gave way, and fled towards their own camp,
which, perceiving themselves closely pursued, they preci∣pitately
abandoned, together with twenty-two pieces of
cannon. In this engagement they lost about eight hun∣dred
men killed and wounded, besides about fifty prisoners,
including Brigadier-General de Bussy, the Chevalier
Godeville, quarter-master-general, Lieutenant Colonel
Murphy, three captains, five lieutenants, and some other
officers. On the side of the English two hundred and six∣ty-two
were killed or wounded, and among the former
the gallant and accomplished Major Brereton, whose
death was a real loss to his country.</P>
<P>§ X. General Lally having retreated with his broken
troops to Pondicherry, the Baron de Vasserot was detach∣ed
towards the same place, with a thousand horse and
three hundred sipoys, to ravage and lay waste the French
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
territory. In the mean time, the indefatigable Colonel
Coote undertook the siege of Chilliput, which in two days
was surrendered by the Chevalier de Tilly, himself and
his garrison remaining prisoners of war. Such also was
the fate of fort Timmery, which being reduced, the Co∣lonel
prosecuted his march to Arcot, the capital of the
province, against the fort of which he opened his batterie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on the fifth day of February. When he had carried on
his approaches within sixty yards of the crest of the gla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
the garrison, consisting of two hundred and fifty Euro∣peans,
and near three hundred sipoys, surrendered as pri∣soners
of war, and here the English commander found
two-and-twenty pieces of cannon, four mortars, and a
great quantity of all kinds of military stores. Thus the
campaign was gloriously finished with the conquest of
Arcot, after the French army had been routed and ruined
by the diligence of Colonel Coote, whose courage, con∣duct,
and activity cannot be sufficiently admired. The
reader will perceive, that, rather than interrupt the thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of such an interesting narration, we have ventured to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
croach upon the annals of the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixty.</P>
<P>§ XI. Having thus followed the British banners through
the glorious tracts they pursued in different parts of Asia
and America, we must now convert our attention to the
continent of Europe, where the English arms, in the
course of this year, triumphed with equal lustre and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tage.
But first it may be necessary to sketch out the situa∣tions
in which the belligerent powers were found at the
close of winter. The vicissitudes of fortune with which
the preceeding campaign had been chequered were suf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ent
to convince every potentate concerned in the war, they
neither side possessed such a superiority in strength <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
conduct as was requisite to impose terms upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Battles had been fought with various success; and sur∣prising
efforts of military skill had been exhibited, with∣out
producing one event which tended to promote a ge∣neral
peace, or even engender the least desire of ac∣commodation;
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
on the contrary, the first and most violent
transports of animosity had by this time subsided into a
confirmed habit of deliberate hatred, and every contending
power seemed more than ever determined to protract the
dispute, while the neutral states kept aloof, without ex∣pressing
the least desire of interposing their mediation.
Some of them were restrained by considerations of conve∣niency;
and others waited in suspense for the death of
the Spanish monarch, as an event which they imagined
would be attended with very important consequences in
the southern parts of Europe. With respect to the main∣tenance
of the war, whatever difficulties might have ari∣sen
in settling funds to support the expense, and finding
men to recruit the different armies, certain it is all these
difficulties were surmounted before the opening of the
campaign. The court of Vienna, though hampered by the
narrowness of its finances, still found resources in the fer∣tility
of its provinces, in the number and attachment of
its subjects, who, more than any other people in Europe,
acquiesce in the dispositions of their sovereign; and, when
pay cannot be afforded, willingly contribute free quarters
for the subsistence of the army. The Czarina, though she
complained that the stipulated subsidies were ill paid, ne∣vertheless
persisted in pursuing those favourite aims which
had for some time influenced her conduct; namely, her
personal animosity to the King of Prussia, and her desire
of obtaining a permanent interest in the German empire.
Sweden still made a show of hostility against the Prussian
monarch, but continued to slumber over the engage∣ments
she had contracted. France, exhausted in her fi∣nances,
and abridged of her marine commerce, maintained
a resolute countenance, supplied fresh armies for her ope∣rations
in Westphalia, projected new schemes of conquest,
and cajoled her allies with fair promises, when she had
nothing more solid to bestow. The King of Prussia's
dominions were generally drained, or in the hands
of the enemy; but, to balance these disadvantages, he
kept possession of Saxony, and enjoyed his annual
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
subsidy from Great-Britain, which effectually enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to maintain his armies on a respectable footing, and open
the campaign with equal eagerness and confidence.</P>
<P>§ XII. The Hanoverian army commanded by Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick, was strengthened by fresh re-enforcements
from England, augmented with German
recruits, regularly paid, and well supplied with every com∣fort
and convenience which foresight could suggest, or
money procure; yet, in spite of all the precautions that
could be taken, they were cut off from some resources
which the French, in the beginning of the year, opened
to themselves by a flagrant stroke of perfidy, which even
the extreme necessities of a campaign can hardly excuse.
On the second day of January, the French regiment of
Nassau presenting itself before the gates of Franckfort on
the Maine, a neutral imperial city, and demanding a pas∣sage,
it was introduced, and conducted by a detachment
of the garrison through the city, as far as the gate of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣en-hausen,
where it unexpectedly halted, and immediately
disarmed the guards. Before the inhabitants could reco∣ver
from the consternation into which they were thrown
by this outrageous insult, five other French regiment▪en∣tered
the place, and here their general, the Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Soubise, established his head quarters. How deeply so∣ever
this violation of the laws of the Empire might be re∣sented
by all honest Germans, who retained affection
for the constitutions of their country, it was a step from
which the French army derived a very manifest and im∣portant
advantage; for it secured to them the course <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Maine and the Upper Rhine; by which they receiv∣ed,
without difficulty or danger, every species of sup∣ply
from Mentz, Spire, Worms, and even the coun∣try
of Alsace; while it maintained their communicati∣on
with the chain formed by the Austrian forces and the
army of the Empire.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The scheme of operations for the ensuing cam∣paign
was already formed between the King of Prussia and
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and before the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
took the field several skirmishes were fought, and quarters
surprised. In the latter end of February, the Prince of
Ysembourg detached Major-General Urst with four bat∣talions
and a body of horse, who, assembling at Rhoten∣bourg,
surprised the enemy's quarters in the night between
the first and second day of March, and drove them from
Hirchfield, Vacha, and all the Hessian bailiwicks of
which they had taken possession; but the Austrians soon
returning in greater numbers, and being supported by a
detachment of French troops from Franckfort, the allies
fell back in their turn. In a few days, however, they them∣selves
retreated again with great precipitation, though
they did not all escape. The Hereditary Prince of Bruns∣wick,
with a body of Prussian hussars, fell upon them sud∣denly
at Molrichstadt, where he routed and dispersed a
regiment of Hohenzollern cuirassiers, and a battalion of
the troops of Wurtzburg. He next day, which was the
first of April, advanced with a body of horse and foot to
Meinungen, where he found a considerable magazine,
took two battalions prisoners, and surprised a third posted
at Wafungen, after having defeated some Austrian troops
that were on the march to its relief. While the Heredi∣tary
Prince was thus employed, the Duke of Holstein,
with another body of the confederates, dislodged the
French from the post of Freyinstenau.</P>
<P>§ XIV. But the great object was to drive the enemy
from Franckfort, before they should receive the expected
re-enforcements. Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, being
determined upon this enterprise, assembled all his forces
near Fulda, to the amount of forty thousand choice troops,
and began his march on the tenth day of April. On the
thirteenth he came in sight of the enemy, whom he found
strongly encamped about the village of Bergen, between
Franckfort and Hanau. Their general, the Duke de Brog∣lio,
counted one of the best officers in France with re∣spect
to conduct and intrepidity, having received intelli∣gence
of the Prince's design, occupied this post on the
twelfth, the right of his army being at Bergen, and his
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
centre and flanks secured in such a manner, that the
allies could not make their attack any other way but by
the village. Notwithstanding the advantage of their
situation, Prince Ferdinand resolved to give them battle,
and made his dispositions accordingly. About ten in the
morning the grenadiers of the advanced guard began the
attack on the village of Bergen with great vivacity, and
sustained a most terrible fire from eight German batta∣lions,
supported by several brigades of French infantry.
The grenadiers of the allied army, though re-enforced by
several battalions under the command of the Prince of
Ysembourg, far from distodging the enemy from the vil∣lage,
were, after a very obstinate dispute, obliged to retreat
in some disorder, but rallied again behind a body of Hes∣sian
cavalry. The allies being repulsed in three different
attacks, their general made a new disposition, and brought
up his artillery, with which the village and different parts
of the French line were severally cannonaded. They were
not slow in retorting an equal fire, which continued till
night, when the allies retreated to Windeken, with the
loss of five pieces of cannon, and about two thousand men,
including the Prince of Ysembourg, who fell in the action.
The French, by the nature of their situation, could not
suffer much, but they were so effectually amused by the
artful disposition of Prince Ferdinand, that, instead of
taking measures to harrass him in his retreat, they care∣fully
maintained their situation, apprehensive of another
general attack. Indeed, they had great reason to be
satisfied with the issue of this battle, without risking, in
any measure, the advantage which they had gained. It
was their business to remain quiet, until their re-enforce∣ments
should arrive, and this plan they in variably pursued.
On the other hand, the allies, in consequence of their mis∣carriage,
were reduced to the necessity of acting upon the
defensive, and encountering a great number of difficulties
and inconveniencies, during great part of the campaign,
until the misconduct of the enemy turned the scale in their
favour. In the mean time, the Prince thought proper to begin
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
his retreat in the night towards Fulda, in which his rear
suffered considerably from a body of the enemy's light
troops, under the command of M. de Blaisel, who sur∣prised
two squadrons of dragoons, and a battalion of gre∣nadiers.
The first were taken or dispersed; the last esca∣ped
with the loss of their baggage. The allied army re∣turned
to their cantonments about Munster, and the
Prince began to make preparations for taking the field in
earnest.</P>
<P>§ XV. While the French enjoyed plenty in the neigh∣bourhood
of Dusseldorp and Crevelt, by means of the
Rhine, the allies laboured under a dearth and scarcity of
every species of provision, because the country which they
occupied was already exhausted, and all the supplies were
brought from an immense distance. The single article
of forage occasioned such enormous expense, as alarmed
the administration of Great Britain, who, in order to pre∣vent
mismanagement and fraud for the future, nominated
a member of parliament inspector-general of the forage,
and sent him over to Germany in the beginning of the
year, with the rank and appointments of a general officer,
that the importance of his character, and the nature of his
office, might be a check upon those who were suspected
of iniquitous appropriations. This gentleman is said to
have met with such a cold reception, and so many morti∣fications
in the execution of his office, that he was in a
very little time sick of his employment. An enquiry into
the causes of his reception, and of the practices which
rendered it necessary to appoint such a superintendant,
may be the province of some future historian, when truth
may be investigated freely, without any apprehension of
pains and penalties.</P>
<P>§ XVI. While great part of the allied army remained
in cantonments about Munster, the French armies on the
Upper and Lower Rhine, being put in motion, joined on
the third day of June near Marpurg, under the command
of the Mareschal de Contades, who advanced to the north∣ward,
and fixed his head quarters at Corbach; from
whence he detached a body of light troops to take pos∣session
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
of Cassel, which at his approach was abandoned by
General Imhoff. The French army being encamped at
Stadtberg, the Duke de Broglio, who commanded the right
wing, advanced from Cassel into the territories of Hano∣ver,
where he occupied Gottingen without opposition;
while the allied army assembled in the neighbourhood
of Lipstadt, and encamped about Soest and Werle,
Prince Ferdinand, finding himself inferior to the united
forces of the enemy, was obliged to retire as they ad∣vanced,
after having left strong garrisons in Lipstadt,
Retberg, Munster, and Minden. These precautions,
however, seemed to produce little effect in his favour,
Retberg was surprised by the Duke de Broglio, who
likewise took Minden by assault, and made Gen. Zastrow,
with his garrison of fifteen hundred men, prisoners of
war; a misfortune considerably aggravated by the loss of
an immense magazine of hay and corn, which fell into
the hands of the enemy. They likewise made themselves
masters of Munster, invested Lipstadt, and all their ope∣rations
were hitherto crowned with success. The regen∣cy
of Hanover, alarmed at their progress, resolved to pro∣vide
for the worst, by sending their chancery and most
valuable effects to Stade, from whence, in case of necessi∣ty,
they might be conveyed by sea to England. In the
mean time they exerted all their industry in pressing men
for recruiting and re-enforcing the army under Prince
Ferdinand, who still continued to retire; and on the
eleventh day of July removed his head-quarters from
Osnabruck to Bomte, near the Weser. Here having re∣ceived
advice that Minden was taken by the French, he
sent forwards a detachment to secure the post of Saltznau
on that river, where on the fifteenth he encamped.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The general of the allied army had for some
time exhibited marks of animosity towards Lord George
Sackville, the second in command, whose extensive under∣standing,
penetrating eye, and inquisitive spirit, could
neither be deceived, dazzled, nor soothed into tame acqui∣escence.
He had opposed, with all his influence, a design
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
of retiring towards the frontiers of Brunswick, in order to
cover that country. He supposted his opposition, by al∣ledging
that it was the enemy's favourite object to cut off
their communication with the Weser and the Elbe; in
which, should they succeed, it would be found impossible to
transport the British troops to their own country, which
was at that time threatened with invasion. He, therefore,
insisted upon the army's retreating, so as to keep the com∣munication
open with Stade, where, in case of emergency,
the English troops might be embarked. By adhering
tenaciously to this opinion, and exhibiting other instances
of a prying disposition, he had rendered himself so dis∣agreeable
to the commander in chief, that, in all appear∣ance,
nothing was so eagerly desired as an opportunity of
removing him from the station he filled.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Mean while, the French general, advancing
to Minden, encamped in a strong situation, having that
town on his right, a steep hill on his left, a morass in front,
and a rivulet in rear. The Duke de Broglio commanded
a separate body between Hansbergen and Minden, on the
other side of the Weser; and a third, under the Duke de
Brissac, consisting of eight thousand men, occupied a
strong post by the village of Coveldt, to facilitate the route
of the convoys from Paderborn. Prince Ferdinand having
moved his camp from Soltznau to Petershagen, detached
the Hereditary Prince on the twenty-eighth day of July to
Lubeke, from whence he drove the enemy; and proceed∣ing
to Rimsel, was joined by Major-General Dreves, who
had retaken Osnabruck, and cleared all that neighbourhood
of the enemy's parties: then he advanced towards Her∣vorden,
and fixed his quarters at Kirchlinneger, to ham∣per
the enemy's convoys from Paderborn. During these
transactions, Prince Ferdinand marched with the allied
army in three columns from Petershagen to Hille, where
it encamped, having a morass on the right, the village of
Fredewalde on the left, and in front those of Northemmern
and Holtzenhausen. Fifteen battalions and nineteen squa∣drons,
with a brigade of heavy artillery, were left under
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
the command of General Wangenheim on the left, be∣hind
the village of Dodenhausen, which was fortified with
some redoubts, defended by two battalions. Colonel
Luckner, with the Hanoverian hussars, and a brigade of
hunters, sustained by two battalions of grenadiers, was
posted between Buckebourg and the Weser, to observe
the body of troops commanded by the Duke de Broglio on
the other side of the river.</P>
<P>§ XIX. On the last day of July, the Mareschal de Con∣tades
resolving to attack the allied army, ordered the corps
of Brogllo to repass the river; and advancing in eight
columns, about midnight passed the rivulet of Barta, that
runs along the morass, and falls into the Weser at Min∣den.
At day-break he formed his army in order of battle,
part of it fronting the corps of General Wangenheim at
Dodenhausen, and part of it facing Hille; the two wings
consisting of infantry, and the cavalry being stationed in
the centre. At three in the morning the enemy began to
cannonade the Prince's quarters at Hille from a battery of
six cannon, which they had raised in the preceding even∣ing
on the dike of Eickhorst. This was probably the first
intimation he received of their intention. He forth with
caused two pieces of artillery to be conveyed to Hille, and
ordered the officer of the piquet-guard posted there to
defend himself to the last extremity: at the same time, he
sent orders to General Giesen, who occupied Lubeke, to
attack the enemy's post at Eickhorst; and this service was
successfully performed. The Prince of Anhalt, lieutenant-general
for the day, took possession with the rest of the
piquets of the village of Halen, where Prince Ferdinand
resolved to support his right. It was already in the hands
of the enemy, but they soon abandoned it with precipita∣tion.
The allied army being put into motion, advanced in
eight columns, and occupied the ground between Halen
and Hammern, while General Wangenheim's corps filled up
the space between this last village and Dodenhausen. The
enemy made their principal effort on the left, intending
to force the infantry of Wangenheim's corps, and penr∣trate
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
between it and the body of the allied army. For
this purpose, the Duke de Broglio attacked them with
great fury, but was severely checked by a battery of thirty
cannon, prepared for his reception by the Count de
Buckebourg, grand master of the artillery, and served
with admirable effect, under his own eye and direction.
About five in the morning both armies cannonaded each
other; at six the fire of musquetry began with great viva∣city,
and the action became very hot towards the right, where
six regiments of English infantry, and two battalions of
Hanoverian guards, not only bore the whole brunt of the
French carabineers and gendarmerie, but absolutely broke
every body of horse and foot that advanced to attack them
on the left and in the centre. The Hessian cavalry, with
some regiments of Holstein, Prussian, and Hanoverian
dragoons posted on the left, performed good service. The
cavalry on the right had no opportunity of engaging.
They were destined to support the infantry of the third
line; they consisted of the British and Hanoverian horse,
commanded by Lord George Sackville, whose second was
the Marquis of Granby. They were posted at a con∣siderable
distance from the first line of infantry, and di∣vided
from it by a scanty wood that bordered on a heath.
Orders were sent, during the action, to bring them up,
but whether these orders were contradictory, unintelli∣gible,
or imperfectly executed, they did not arrive in time
to have any share in the action<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the general was not pleased with the behaviour of Lord George
Sackville may be gathered from the following compliment to the Marquis of
Granby, implying a severe Reflexion upon his superior in command:
<HI>Orders of his Serene Highness Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, relative to the be∣haviour
of the under him at the famous battle near Minden, on the 1st of
August, 1759.</HI>
“HIS Serene High ness order his greatest than ks to be given to the whole
army, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their bravery and good behaviour yesterday, particularly to the Eng∣lish
insantry, and the two battalions of Hanoverian guards: to all the ca∣valry
of the left wing, and to General Wangenbeim's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, particularly the
regiment of Holstein, the Hessian cavalry, the Hanoverian regiment du Corps,
and Hammerstin's; the same to all the brigades of heavy artillery. His
Serene Highness declares publickly, that next to God he attributes the glory of
the day to the intrepidity and extraordinary good behaviour of these troops,
which he assures them he shall retain the strongest sense of as long as he lives;
and if ever, upon any occasion, he shall be able to serve these brave troops,
or any of them in particular, it will give him the utmost pleasure. His Se∣rene
Highness orders his particular thanks to be likewise given to General
Sporcken, the Duke of Holstein, Lieutenant-Generals Imhoff and Urf. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Serene Highness is extremely obliged to the Count de Buckebourg, for his ex∣traordinary
care and trouble in the management of the artillery, which was
served with great effect; likewise to the commanding officers of the several
brigades of artillery, viz. Colonel Browne, Lieutenant-Colonel Hutte, Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
Hasse, and the three English captains, Philips, Drummond, and Foy.
His Serene Highness thinks himself infinitely obliged to Major-Generals
Waldegrave and Kingsley, for their great courage, and good order in which
they conducted their brigades. His Serene Highness further orders it to be
declared to Lieutenant-General the Marquis of Granby, that he is persuaded,
that if he had the good fortune to have had him at the head of the ca∣valry
of the right wing, his presence would have greatly contributed to make
the decision of that day more complete and more brilliant. In short, his
Serene Highness orders that those of his suite whose behaviour he most ad∣mired
be named, as the Duke of Richmond, Colonel Fitzroy, Captain
Ligonier, Colonel Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son, Captain Wilson, aide-du-camp to Major-General
Waldegrave, Adjutant-Generals Erstoff, Bulow, Durendolle, the Count
Tobe, and Maler<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i; his Serene Highness having much reason to be satisfied
with their conduct. And his Serene Highness desires and orders the generals
of the army, that upon all occasions when orders are brought to them by his
aides-du-camp, that they may be obeyed punctually, and without delay.”</NOTE>; nor, indeed, were they
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
originally intended for that purpose; nor was there the
least occasion for their service; nor could they have come
up in time and condition to perform effectual service, had
the orders been explicit and consistent, and the com∣mander
acted with all possible expedition. Be that as it
will, the enemy were repulsed in all their attacks with
considerable loss: at length they gave way in every part;
and about noon, abandoning the field of battle, were pur∣sued
to the ramparts of Minden. In this action they lost
a great number of men, with forty-three large cannon,
and many colours and standards; whereas the loss of the
allies was very inconsiderable, as it chiefly fell upon a few
regiments of British infantry, commanded by the Major-Generals
Waldegrave and Kingsley. To the extraordi∣nary
prowess of these gallant brigades, and the fire of
the British artillery, which was admirably served by the
Captains Philips, Macbean, Drummond, and Foy, the
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
victory was in a great measure ascribed. The same night
the enemy passed the Weser, and burned the bridges over
that river. Next day the garrison of Minden surrendered
at discretion, and here the victors found a great number
of French officers wounded.</P>
<P>§ XX. At first the Mareschal de Contades seemed in∣clined
to retreat through the defiles of Wittekendstein,
to Paderborn; but he was fain to change his resolution,
in consequence of his having received advice, that on the
very day of his own defeat the Duke de Brissac was van∣guished
by the Hereditary Prince in the neighbourhood
of Coveldt, so that the passage of the mountains was ren∣dered
impracticable. The Duke de Brissac had been ad∣vantageously
encamped with his left to the village of
of Coveldt, having the Werra in front, and his right ex∣tending
to the salt-pits. In this advantageous situation he
was attacked by the Hereditary Prince and General de
Kilmanseg with such vivacity and address, that his troops
were totally routed, with the loss of six cannon, and a
considerable number of men killed, wounded, or taken
prisoners. After the battle of Minden, Colonel Freytag,
at the head of the light troops, took, in the neighbour∣hood
of Detmold, all the equipage of the Mareschal de
Contades, the Prince of Conde, and the Duke de Brissac,
with part of their military chest and chancery, containing
papers of the utmost consequence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following extracts of letters from the Duke de Belleiste to the Mareschal de Contades will convey some idea of the virtue, policy, and neces∣sities of the French ministry: “I am still afraid that Fisher sets out too late: it is, however, very important, and very essential, that we should raise large contributions. I see no other resource for our most urgent expenses, and for refitting the troops, but in the money we may draw from the enemy's country; from whence we must likewise procure subsistence of all kinds (independently of the money) that is to say, hay, straw, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the winter, bread, corn, cattle, horses, even men, to recruit our foreign troops. The war must not be prolonged, and perhaps it may be necessary, according to the events which may happen between this and the end of September, to make a downright desert before the line of the quarters, which it may be thought proper to keep during the winter, in order that the enemy may be under a real impossibility of ap∣proaching us: at the same time reserving for ourselves a bare subsistence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the route which may be the most convenient for us to take, in the middle winter, to beat up or seise upon the enemy's quarters.

the Weser at Hamelen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> in order to pursue the enemy,
who retreated to Cassel, and from thence, by the way of
Marpurg, as far as Giessen. In a word, they were con∣tinually
harrassed by that enterprising prince, who seised
every opportunity of making an impression upon their
army; took the greatest part of their baggage; and com∣pelled
them to abandon every place they possessed in West∣phalia▪
The number of his prisoners amounted to fifteen
hundred men, besides the garrison left at Cassel, which
surrendered at discretion. He likewise surprised a whole
battalion, and defeated a considerable detachment under
the command of M. d'Armentieres. In the mean time,
the allied army advanced in regular marches; and Prince
Ferdinand, having taken possession of Cassel, detached
General Imhoff, with a body of troops, to reduce the
city of Munster, which he accordingly began to bombard
and cannonade; but M. d'Armentieres, being joined by
a fresh body of troops from the Lower Rhine, advanced
to its relief, and compelled Imhost to raise the siege. It
was not long, however, before this general was also re-en∣forced;
then he measured back his march to Munster,
and the French commander withdrew in his turn. The
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
place was immediately shut up by a close blockade <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
which, however, did not prevent the introduction <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
supplies. The city of Munster, being an object of im∣portance,
was disputed with great obstinacy. Arme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

by Imhoff was occasionally augmented; but the siege <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not formally undertaken till November, when some heav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

invested, and the operations carried on with suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vigour, that in a few days the city surrendered on capitu∣lation.</P>
<P>§ XXII. Prince Ferdinand having possessed himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the town and castle of Marpurg, proceeded with the arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to Neider-Weimar, and there encamped; while Contade
remained at Giessen, on the south side the river <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
where he was joined by a colleague in the person of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mareschal d'Estrees. By this time he was become ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
unpopular among the troops, on account of the defeat a
Minden, which he is said to have charged on the miscon∣duct
of Broglio, which recriminated on him in his turn,
and seemed to gain credit at the court of Versaille<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
While the two armies lay encamped in the neighbourhood
of each other, nothing passed but skirmishes among the
light troops, and little excursive expeditions. The French
army was employed in removing their magazines, and for∣tifying
Giessen, as if their intention was to retreat to
Fanckfort on the Maine, after having consumed all the
forage, and made a military desert between the Lahn and
that river. In the beginning of November, the Mares∣chal
Duke de Broglio returned from Paris, and assume<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the command of the army, from whence Contades and
d'Estrees immediately retired, with several other gener<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
officers that were senior to the new commander.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The Duke of Wirtemberg having take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
possession of Fulda, the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick
resolved to beat up his quarters. For this purpose he se∣lected
a body of troops, and began his march from Mar∣purg
early in the morning on the twenty-eighth day of
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
November. Next night they lay at Augerbach, where they
defeated the volunteers of Nassau: and at one o'clock in
the morning of the thirtieth, they marched directly to
Fulda, where the Duke of Wirtemberg, far from ex∣pecting
such a visit, had invited all the fashionable people
in Fulda to a sumptuous entertainment. The Hereditary
Prince, having reconnoitred the avenues in person, took
such measures, that the troops of Wirtemberg, who were
scattered in small bodies, would have been cut off, if they
had not hastily retired into the town, where, however,
they found no shelter. The Prince forced open the gates;
and they retreated to the other side of the town, where
four battalions of them were defeated and taken; while
the Duke himself, with the rest of his forces, filed off on
the other side of the Fulda. Two pieces of cannon, two
pair of colours, and all their baggage, fell into the hands
of the victors; and the Hereditary Prince advanced as far
as Rupertenrade, a place situated on the right flank of the
French army. Perhaps this motion hastened the reso∣lution
of the Duke de Broglio to abandon Giessen, and
fall back to Friedberg, where he established his head∣quarters.
The allied army immediately took possession
of his camp at Kleinlinnes and Heuchelam, and seemed
to make preparations for the siege of Giessen.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. While both armies remained in this position,
the Duke de Broglio received the staff as mareschal of
France, and made an attempt to beat up the quarters of
the allies. Having called in all his detachments, he
marched up to them on the 25th day of December; but
found them so well disposed to give him a warm reception,
that he thought proper to lay aside his design, and nothing
but a mutual cannonade ensued; then he returned to his
former quarters. From Kleinlinnes the allied army re∣moved
to Corsdorff, where they were cantoned till the begin∣ning
of January, when they fell back as far as Marpurg,
where Prince Ferdinand established his head-quarters.
The enemy had by this time retrieved their superiority,
in consequence of the Hereditary Prince's being detached
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
with fifteen thousand men to join the King of Prussia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Freyberg, in Saxony. Thus, by the victory at Minden,
the dominions of Hanover and Brunswick were preserved,
and the enemy obliged to evacuate great part of Westpha∣lia.
Perhaps they might have been driven to the other
side of the Rhine, had not the general of the allies been
obliged to weaken his army for the support of the Prussian
monarch, who had met with divers disasters in the course
of this campaign. It was not to any relaxation or aba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ment
of his usual vigilance and activity that this warli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
prince owed the several checks he received. Even in the
middle of winter, his troops, under General Manteuffel,
acted with great spirit against the Swedes in Pomerania.
They made themselves masters of Damgarten, and seve∣ral
other places which the Swedes had garrisoned; and,
the frost setting in, those who were quartered in the isle
of Usedom passed over the ice to Wolgast, which they re∣duced
without much difficulty. They undertook the
sieges of Demmin and Anclam at the same time, and the
garrisons of both surrendered themselves prisoners of war,
to the number of two thousand seven hundred men, in∣cluding
officers. In Demmin they found four-and-twenty
pieces of cannon, with a large quantity of ammunition.
In Anclam there was a considerable magazine, with six-and-thirty
cannon, mortars, and howitzers. A large de∣tachment
under General Knobloch surprised Erfurth, and
raised considerable contributions at Gotha, Eise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach, and
Fulda; from whence also they conveyed all the forage
and provisions to Saxe-Naumberg. In the latter end of
February, the Prussian Major-General Wobersnow
marched with a strong body of troops from Gloga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
Silesia to Poland; and, advancing by the way of Lissa,
attacked the castle of the Prince Sulkowski, a Polish
grandee, who had been very active against the interest of
the Prus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian monarch. After some resistance he was obli∣ged
to surrender at discretion, and was sent prisoner with
his whole garrison to Silesia. From hence Wobersnow
proceeded to Posna, where he made himself master of a
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
considerable magazine, guarded by two thousand Cossacks,
who retired at his approach; and, having destroyed seve∣ral
others, returned to Silesia. In April, the fort of Pe∣namunde,
in Pomerania, was surrendered to Manteuffel;
and about the same time a detachment of Prussian troops
bombarded Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg.
Mean while, re-enforcements were sent to the Russian
army in Poland, which in April began to assemble upon
the Vistula. The court of Petersburgh had likewise begun
to equip a large fleet, by means of which the army might
be supplied with military stores and provisions; but this
armament was retarded by an accidental fire at Revel,
which destroyed all the magazines and materials for ship-building
to an immense value.</P>
<P>§ XXV. About the latter end of March the King of
Prussia assembled his army at Rhonstock, near Strigau;
and advancing to the neighbourhood of Landshut, en∣camped
at Bolchenhayn. On the other hand, the Au∣strian
army, under the command of Mareschal Daun,
was assembled at Munchengratz, in Bohemia; and the
campaign was opened by an exploit of General Beck,
who surprised and made prisoners a battalion of Prussian
grenadiers, posted under Colonel Durinsheven, at Grie∣fenberg,
on the frontiers of Silesia. This advantage,
however, was more than counterbalanced by the activity
and success of Prince Henry, brother to the Prussian
king, who commanded the army which wintered in
Saxony. About the middle of April he marched in two
columns towards Bohemia, forced the pass of Peterswalde,
destroyed the Austrian magazine at Aussig, burned their
boats upon the Elbe, seised the forage and provision which
the enemy had left at Lowositz and Leutmeritz, and de∣molished
a new bridge which they had built for their
convenience. At the same time, General Hulsen attacked
the pass of Passberg, guarded by General Renard, who
was taken, with two thousand men, including fifty of∣ficers:
then he advanced to Satz, in hopes of securing
the Austrian magazines; but these the enemy consumed,
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
that they might not fall into his hands, and retired to∣wards
Prague with the utmost precipitation.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Prince Henry, having happily atchieved these
adventures, and filled all Bohemia with alarm and con∣sternation,
returned to Saxony, and distributed his troops
in quarters of refreshment in the neighbourhood of Dres∣den.
In a few days, however they were again put in
motion, and marched to Obelgeburgen; from whence he
continued his route through Voightland, in order to attack
the army of the empire in Franconia. He accordingly
entered this country by the way of Hoff, on the seventh
of May, and next day sent a detachment to attack General
Macguire, who commanded a body of Imperialists at
Asch, and sustained the charge with great gallantry; but
sinding himself in danger of being overpowered by num∣bers,
he retired in the night towards Egra. The army
of the Empire, commanded by the Prince de Deux-Ponts,
being unable to cope with the Prussian general in the field,
retired from Cullembach to Bamberg, and from thence
to Nuremberg, where, in all probability, they would
not have been suffered to remain unmolested, had not
Prince Henry been recalled to Saxony. He had already
taken Cronach and the castle of Rotenberg, and even ad∣vanced
as far as Bamberg, when he received advice that a
body of Austrians, under General Gemmingen, had pe∣netrated
into Saxony. This diversion effectually saved the
army of the empire, as Prince Henry immediately re∣turned
to the electorate, after having laid the bishoprick of
Bamberg and the marquisate of Cullembach under contri∣bution,
destroyed all the magazines provided for the Im∣perial
army, and sent sifteen hundred prisoners to Leipsick,
A party of Imperialists, under Count Palfy, endeavoured
to harrass him in his retreat; but they were defeated near
Hoff, with considerable slaughter: nevertheless, the Im∣perial
army, though now reduced to ten thousand men,
returned to Bamberg; and as the Prussians approached
the frontiers of Saxony, the Austrian general, Gemmi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gen,
retired into Bohemia. During all these transactions,
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
the Mareschal Count Daun remained with the grand Au∣strian
army at Schurtz, in the circle of Koningsgratz;
while the Prussians, commanded by the King in person,
continued quietly encamped between Landshut and
Schweidnitz. General Fouquet commanded a large body
of troops in the southern part of Silesia; but these being
mostly withdrawn, in order to oppose the Russians, the
Austrian general, De Fille, who hovered on the frontiers
of Moravia, with a considerable detachment, took ad∣vantage
of this circumstance, and, advancing into Silesia,
encamped within sight of Neiss.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. As mutual calumny and recrimination of
all kinds were not spared on either side, during the progress
of this war, the enemies of the Prussian monarch did not
fail to charge him with cruelties committed at Schwerin,
the capital of Mecklenburg, which his troops had bom∣barded,
plundered of its archives, cannon, and all its youth
fit to carry arms, who were pressed into his service: he
besides taxed the duchy at seven thousand men, and a
million of crowns, by way of contribution. He was
also accused of barbarity, in issuing an order for removing
all the prisoners from Berlin to Spandau; but this step he
justified, in a letter to his ministers at foreign courts, de∣claring,
that he had provided for all the officers that were
his prisoners the best accommodation, and permitted them
to reside in his capital; that some of them had grossly
abused the liberty they enjoyed, by maintaining illicit
correspondence, and other practices equally offensive,
which had obliged him to remove them to the town of
Spandau: he desired, however, that the town might not
be confounded with the fortress of that name, from which
it was entirely separated, and in which they would enjoy
the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase they had found at Berlin, though under
more vigilant inspection. His conduct, on this occasion,
he said, was sufficiently authorised, not only by the law
of nations, but also by the example of his enemies; inas∣much
as the Empress-Queen had never suffered any of
his officers, who had fallen into her hands, to reside at
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
Vienna; and the court of Russia had sent some of them
as far as Casan. He concluded with saying, that, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his enemies had let slip no opportunity of blackening hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
most innocent proceedings, he had thought proper to ac∣quaint
his ministers with his reasons for making this alter∣ation
with regard to his prisoners, whether French, Au∣strians,
or Russians.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. In the beginning of June, the King of
Prussia, understanding that the Russian army had begun
their march from the Vistula, ordered the several bodies
of his troops, under Hulsen and Wobersnow, re-en∣forced
by detachments from his other armies, to join the
forces under Count Dohna, as general in chief, and
march into Poland. Accordingly, they advanced to Me∣ritz,
where the Count having published a declaration
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The following declarations were published by Count Dohna, a Prussian general▪ on his entering Poland with a body of Prussian troops. On the</HI> 15<HI>th of June.</HI>
HIS Prussian Majesty, finding himself under a necessity to cause part of his armies to enter the territories of the republick of Poland, in order to protect them against the threatened invasion of the enemy, declares that
It must not be understood that his Majesty, by this step taken, intends to make any breach in the regard he has always had for the illustrious republick of Poland, or to lessen the good understanding which has hitherto subsisted between them, but, on the contrary, to strengthen the same, in expectation that the illustrious republick will, on its part, act with the like neighbourly and friendly good will as is granted to the enemy, than which nothing more is desired.
The nobility, gentry, and magistracy, in their respective districts, between the frontiers of Prussia, so far as beyond Posen, are required to furnish all kinds of provisions, corn, and sorage necessary to support an army of 40,000 men, with the utmost dispatch, with an assurance of being paid ready money for the same. But if, contrary to expectation, any deficiency should happen in supplying this demand, his Majesty's troops will be obliged to forage, and use the same means as those taken by the enemy for their subsistence.
In confidence thereof, that the several jurisdictions upon the Prussian fron∣tiers, within the territories of Poland, will exert themselves to comply with this demand as soon as possible, for the subsistence of the royal army of Prussia, they are assured that thereby all disorders will be prevented, and whatever to delivered will be paid for in ready money.
<HI>On the</HI> 17<HI>th of June.</HI>
IT was with the greatest astonishment that the King, my most gracious lord and master, heard that several of his own subjects had suffered themselves to be seduced from their allegiance so far, as to enter into the service of a potentate with whom he is at war; his Majesty, therefore, makes known by these presents, that all of his subjects serving in the enemy's armies, who shall be taken with arms in their hands, shall, agreeably to all laws, be sen∣tenced to be hanged without mercy, as traitors to their king and country. Of which all whom it may concern are desired to take notice, &amp;c.
<HI>On the</HI> 22<HI>d of June.</HI>
We invite and desire that the nobility, archbishops, bishops, abbeys, convents, seigniories, magistrates, and inhabitants of the republick of Po∣land, on the road to Posnania, and beyond it, would repair in person, or by deputies, in the course of this week, or as soon after as possible, to the Prus∣sian head-quarters, there to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat with the commander in chief, or the com∣missary at war, for the delivery of sorage and provisions for the subsistence of the army, to be paid for with ready money.
We promise and assure ourselves, that no person in Poland will attempt to seduce the Prussian troops to desert; that no assistance will be given them in such perfidious practices; that they will neither be sheltered, concealed, or lodged; which would be followed by very disagreeable consequences; we expect, on the contrary, that persons of all ranks and conditions will stop any run-away or deserter, and deliver him up to the first advanced post, or at the head-quarters; and all expences attending the same shall be paid, and a rea∣sonable gratification super added.
If any one hath any inclination to enter into the King of Prussia's service, with an intention to behave well and faithfully, he may apply to the head∣quarters, and be assured for a capitulation for three or four years.
If any prince or member of the republick of Poland be disposed to assemble a body of men, and to join in a troop, or in a company, the Prussian army, to make a common cause with it, he may depend on a gracious reception, and that due regard will be shewn to his merit, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
he continued his march towards Posna, where he found
the Russian army under Count Soltikoff strongly encamp∣ed,
having in their rear that city and the river Warta,
and in their front a formidable entrenchment, mounted
with a great number of cannon. Count Dohna judging
it impracticable to attack them in this situation with any
prospect of success, endeavoured to intercept their convoys
to the eastward; but, for want of provision, was in a
little time obliged to return towards the Oder: then the
Russians advanced to Zullichaw, in Silesia. The King of
Prussia, thinking Count Dohna had been rather too cau∣tious,
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
considering the emergency of affairs, gave him leave
to retire for the benefit of his health, and conferred his
command upon General Wedel, who resolved to give the
Russians battle without delay. Thus determined, he
marched against them in two columns; and, on the
twenty-third day of July, attacked them at Kay, near
Zullichaw, where, after a very obstinate engagement, he was
repulsed with great loss, Wobersnow being killed, and Man∣teussel
wounded in the action; and in a few days the Rus∣sians
made themselves masters of Franckfort upon the Oder.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. By this time, the armies of Count Daun and
the King of Prussia had made several motions. The Au∣strians
having quitted their camp at Schurtz, advanced
towards Zittau in Lusatia, where having halted a few
days, they resumed their march, and encamped at Gorlit∣hayn,
between Sudenberg and Mark-Lissau. His Prussian
Majesty, in order to observe their motions, marched by
the way of Herchberg to Lahn; and his vanguard skir∣mished
with that of the Austrians commanded by Lau∣dohn,
who entered Silesia by the way of Grieffenberg.
The Austrian general was obliged to retreat with loss;
while the King penetrated into Silesia, that he might be
at hand to act against the Russians, whose progress was
now become the chief object of his apprehension. He no
sooner received intimation that Wedel had been worsted,
than he marched with a select body of ten thousand men
from his camp in Silesia, in order to take upon him the com∣mand
of Wedel's army, leaving the rest of his forces strong∣ly
encamped, under the direction of his brother Prince
Henry, who had joined him before this event. Count Daun
being apprised of the King's intention, and knowing the Rus∣sians
were very defective in cavalry, immediately detached a
body of twelve thousand horse, to join them, under the
command of Laudohn; and these, penetrating in two
columns through Silesia and Lusatia, with some loss, ar∣rived
in the Russian camp at a very critical juncture.
Mean while the King of Prussia joined General Wedel on
the fourth day of August at Muhlrose, where he assumed
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
the command of the army: but finding it greatly inferior
to the enemy, he recalled General Finck, whom he had
detached some time before, with a body of nine thousand
men, to oppose the progress of the Imperialists in Saxony:
for when Prince Henry joined his brother in Silesia the
army of the Empire had entered that electorate. Thus
re-enforced, the number of the King's army at Muhlrose
did not exceed fifty thousand, whereas the Russians were
more numerous by thirty thousand. They had chosen a
strong camp at the village of Cunersdorf, almost opposite
to Franckfort upon the Oder, and encreased the natural
strength of their situation by entrenchments mounted with
a numerous artillery. In other circumstances it might
have been deemed a rash and ridiculous enterprise to attack
such an army under such complicated disadvantages; but
here was no room for hesitation. The King's affairs
seemed to require a desperate effort; and perhaps he was
partly impelled by self-confidence and animosity.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Having determined to hazard an attack, he
made his disposition, and on the twelfth day of August,
at two in the morning, his troops were in motion. The
army being formed in a wood, advanced towards the ene∣my;
and about eleven the action was begun with a severe
cannonade. This having produced the desired effect, he
charged the left wing of the Russian army with his best
troops formed in columns. After a very obstinate dispute
the enemy's entrenchments were forced with great
slaughter, and seventy pieces of cannon fell into the hands
of the Prussians. A narrow desile was afterwards passed,
and several redoubts that covered the village of Cuners∣dorf
were taken by assault, one after another: one half of
the task was not yet performed: the Russians made a
firm stand at the village; but they were overborne by the
impetuosity of the Prussians, who drove them from post
to post up to the last redoubts they had to defend. As the
Russians kept their ground until they were hewn down in
their ranks, this success was not acquired without infinite
labour, and a considerable expense of blood. After a fu∣rious
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
contest of six hours, fortune seemed to declare so
much in favour of the Prussians, that the King dispatched
the following billet to the Queen at Berlin: “Madam,
we have driven the Russians from their entrenchments.
In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.” This
intimation was premature, and subjected the writer to
the ridicule of his enemies. The Russians were stagger∣ed,
not routed. General Soltikoff rallied his troops, and
re-enforced his left wing under cover of a redoubt, which
was erected on an eminence called the Jews Burying-ground,
and here they stood in order of battle, with the
most resolute countenance; favoured by the situation,
which was naturally difficult of access, and now rendered
almost impregnable by the fortification, and a numerous
artillery, still greatly superior to that of the Prussians.
Had the King contented himself with the advantage al∣ready
gained, all the world would have acknowledged he
had fought against terrible odds with astonishing prowess;
and that he judiciously desisted, when he could no longer
persevere without incurring the imputation of being ac∣tuated
by frenzy or despair. His troops had not only suf∣fered
severely from the enemy's fire, which was close,
deliberate, and well directed, but they were fatigued by the
hard service, and fainting with the heat of the day, which
was excessive. His general officers are said to have remind∣ed
him of all these circumstances; and to have dissuaded
him from hazarding an attempt attended with such dan∣ger
and difficulty, as even an army of fresh troops could
hardly hope to surmount. He rejected this salutary ad∣vice,
and ordered his infantry to begin a new attack,
which beingan enterprise beyond their strength, they were
repulsed with great slaughter. Being afterwards rallied,
they returned to the charge: they miscarried again, and
their loss was redoubled. Being thus rendered unsit for
further service, the cavalry succeeded to the attack, and
repeated their unsuccessful efforts until they were almost
broke, and entirely exhausted. At this critical juncture,
the whole body of the Austrian and Russian cavalry, which
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
had hitherto remained inactive, and were therefore fresh,
and in spirits, fell in among the Prussian horse with great
fury, broke their line at the first charge, and forcing them
back upon the infantry, threw them into such disorder as
could not be repaired. The Prussian army being thus in∣volved
in confusion, was seized with a panick, and in a
few minutes totally defeated and dispersed, notwithstand∣ing
the personal efforts of the King, who hazarded his
life in the hottest parts of the battle, led on his troops three
times to the charge, had two horses killed under him, and
his clothes in several parts penetrated with musquet-balls.
His army being routed, and the greater part of his generals
either killed or disabled by wounds, nothing but the ap∣proach
of night could have saved him from total ruin.
When he abandoned the field of battle, he dispatched ano∣ther
billet to the Queen, couched in these terms: “Re∣move
from Berlin with the royal family. Let the
archives be carried to Potsdam. The town may make
conditions with the enemy.” The horror and confu∣sion
which this intimation produced at Berlin may be
easily conceived: horror the more aggravated, as it seised
them in the midst of their rejoicing occasioned by the first
dispatch; and this was still more dreadfully augmented,
by a subsequent indistinct relation, importing that the
army was totally routed, the King missing, and the enemy
in full march to Berlin. The battle of Cunersdorf was
by far the most bloody action that had happened since the
commencement of hostilities. The carnage was truely
horrible: above twenty thousand Prussians lay dead on
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, and among these General Putkammer. The
Generals Seidlitz, Itzenplitz, Hulsen, Finck, and Wedel,
the Prince of Wirtemberg, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive major-generals were
wounded. The loss of the enemy amounted to ten thou∣sand.
It must be owned, that if the King was prodigal of
his own person, he was likewise very free with the lives of
his subjects. At no time, since the days of ignorance and
barbarity, were the lives of men squandered away with
such profusion as in the course of this German war.
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
They were not only unnecessarily sacrificed in various
exploits of no consequence, but lavishly exposed to all
the rigour and distemper of winter-campaigns, which
were introduced on the continent, in despite of nature,
and in contempt of humanity. Such are the improve∣ments
of warriors without feeling! such the refinements
of German discipline! On the day that succeeded the de∣feat
at Cunersdorf, the King of Prussia, having lost the
best part of his army, together with his whole train of ar∣tillery,
repassed the Oder, and encamped at Retwin; from
whence he advanced to Fustenwalde, and saw with asto∣nishment
the forbearance of the enemy. Instead of tak∣ing
possession of Berlin, and overwhelming the wreck of
the King's troops, destitute of cannon, and cut off from
all communication with Prince Henry, they took no step
to improve the victory they had gained. Laudohn retired
with his horse immediately after the battle, and Count Sol∣tikoff
marched with part of the Russians into Lusatia,
where he joined Daun, and held consultations with that
general. Perhaps the safety of the Prussian monarch was
owing to the jealousy subsisting among his enemies. In
all probability, the court of Vienna would have been cha∣grined
to see the Russians in possession of Brandenburg,
and therefore thwarted their designs upon that electorate.
The King of Prussia had now reason to be convinced that
his situation could not justify such a desperate attack as
that in which he had miscarried at Cunersdorf; for if the
Russians did not attempt the reduction of this capital,
now that he was totally defeated, and the flower of his
army cut off, they certainly would not have aspired at that
conquest while he lay encamped in the neighbourhood
with fifty thousand veterans, inured to war, accustomed
to conquer, confident of success, and well supplied with
provision, ammunition, and artillery. As the victors al∣lowed
him time to breathe, he improved this interval
with equal spirit and sagacity. He re-assembled and re∣freshed
his broken troops; he furnished his camp with
cannon from the arsenal at Berlin, which likewise sup∣plied
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
him with a considerable number of recruits: he re∣called
General Kleist, with five thousand men, from Po∣merania;
and in a little time retrieved his former im∣portance.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The army of the Empire having entered
Saxony, where it reduced Leipsick, Torgau, and even
took possession of Dresden itself, the King detached six
thousand men under General Wunch, to check the pro∣gress
of the Imperialists in that electorate; and perceiving
the Russians intended to besiege Great Glogau, he, with
the rest of his army, took post between them and that
city, so as to frustrate their design. While the four great
armies, commanded by the King of Prussia, General Sol∣tikoff,
Prince Henry, and Count Daun, lay encamped in
Lusatia, and on the borders of Silesia, watching the mo∣tions
of each other, the war was carried on by detach∣ments
with great vivacity. General Wunch having reta∣ken
Leipsick, and joined Finck at Eulinbourg, the united
body began their march towards Dresden; and a detach∣ment
from the army of the Empire, which had encamped
near Dobelin, retired at their approach. As they advanced
to Noffin, General Haddick abandoned the advantage∣ous
post he occupied near Roth-Scemberg, and, being
joined by the whole army of the Empire, resolved to
attack the Prussian generals, who now encamped at Cor∣bitz
near Meissen; accordingly, on the twenty-first day
of September, he advanced against them, and endeavour∣ed
to dislodged them by a furious cannonade, which was
mutually maintained from morning to night, when he
sound himself obliged to retire with considerable loss▪
leaving the field of battle, with about five hundred priso∣ners,
in the hands of the Prussians.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. This advantage was succeeded by another
exploit of Prince Henry, who, on the twenty-third day
of the month, quitted his camp at Hornsdorf, near Corlitz,
and, after an incredible march of eleven German miles,
by the way of Rothenberg, arrived, about five in the af∣ternoon,
at Hoyerswerda, where he surprised a body of
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
four thousand men, commanded by General Vehla, killed
six hundred, and made twice that number prisoners; in∣cluding
the commander himself. After this atchievement
he joined the corps of Finck and Wunch; while Mares∣chal
Daun likewise abandoned his camp in Lusatia, and
made a forced march to Dresden, in order to frustrate the
Prince's supposed design on that capital. The Russians,
disappointed in their scheme upon Glogau, had repassed
the Oder at Neusalze, and were encamped at Fraustadt;
General Laudohn, with a body of Austrians, lay at
Sclichtingskeim; and the King of Prussia at Koben; all
three on or near the banks of that river. Prince Henry
perceiving his army almost surrounded by Austrian de∣tachments,
ordered General Finck to drive them from
Vogelsang, which they abandoned accordingly; and sent
Wunch, with six battalions and some cavalry, across the
Elbe, to join the corps of General Rebentish at Witten∣berg,
whither he retired from Duben at the approach of
the Austrians. On the twenty-ninth day of October the
Duke d'Aremberg, with sixteen thousand Austrians, de∣camped
from Dammitch, in order to occupy the heights
near Pretsch, and was encountered by General Wunch,
who, being posted on two rising grounds, cannonaded the
Austrians in their march with considerable effect, and the
Prince took twelve hundred prisoners, including Lieute∣nant-General
Gemmingen, and twenty inferior officers,
with some cannon, great part of their tents, and a large
quantity of baggage. The Duke was obliged to change
his route, while Wunch marched from Duben to Eulen∣burg;
and General Wassersseben occupied Strehla, where
next day the whole army encamped. In this situation the
Prince remained till the sixteenth day of November,
when, being in danger of having his communication with
Torgau cut off by the enemy, he removed to a strong
camp, where his left flank was covered by that city and
the river Elbe: his right being secured by a wood, and
great part of his front by an impassable morass. Here he was
re-enforced with about twenty thousand men from Silesia,
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
and joined by the King himself, who forthwith detached
General Finck, with nineteen battalions and thirty-five
squadrons, to take possession of the defiles of Maxen and
Ottendorf, with a view to hinder the retreat of the Aus∣trians
to Bohemia. This motion obliged Daun to retire
to Plauen; and the King advanced to Wilsdurf, imagin∣ing
that he had effectually succeeded in his design. Let∣ters
were sent to Berlin and Magdebourg, importing,
that Count Daun would be forced to hazard a battle, as
he had now no resource but in victory. Finck had no soon∣er
taken post on the hill near the village of Maxen, than
the Austrian general sent officers to reconnoitre his situ∣ation,
and immediately resolved to attack him with the
corps de reserve under the Baron de Sincere, which was
encamped in the neighbourhood of Dippodefwalda. It
was forthwith divided into four columns, which filed off
through the neighbouring woods; and the Prussians ne∣ver
dreamed of their approach until they saw themselves
entirely surrounded. In this emergency they defended
themselves with their cannon and musquetry until they
were overpowered by numbers, and their battery was ta∣ken:
then they retired to another rising ground, where
they rallied, but were driven from eminence to eminence,
until, by favour of the night, they made their last retreat
to Falkenhayn. In the mean time, Count Daun had
made such dispositions, that at day-break General Finck
found himself entirely enclosed, without the least possibi∣lity
of escaping, and sent a trumpet to Count Daun, to
demand a capitulation. This was granted in one single
article, importing, That he and eight other Prussian ge∣nerals,
with the whole body of troops they commanded,
should be received as prisoners of war. He was obliged
to submit, and his whole corps, amounting to nineteen
battalions and thirty-five squadrons, with sixty-four pie∣ces
of cannon, fifty pair of colours, and twenty-five stand∣ards,
fell into the hands of the Austrian general. This
misfortune was the more mortifying to the King of
Prussia, as it implied a censure on his conduct, for having
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
detached such a numerous body of troops to a situation
where they could not be sustained by the rest of the army
On the other hand, the court of Vienna exulted in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
victory, as an infallible proof of Daun's superior talents
and, in point of glory and advantage, much more than at
equivalent for the loss of the Saxon army, which, though
less numerous, capitulated in the year one thousand seven
hundred and fifty-six, after having held out six weeks
against the whole power of the Prussian monarch. Ge∣neral
Hulsen had been detached, with about nine batta∣lions
and thirty squadrons, to the assistance of Finck; but
he arrived at Klingenberg too late to be of any service;
and, being recalled, was next day sent to occupy the im∣portant
post of Freyberg.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The defeat of General Finck was not the
only disaster which befel the Prussians at the close of this
campaign. General Diercke, who was posted with seven
battalions of infantry, and a thousand horse, on the right
bank of the Elbe, opposite to Meissen, finding it imprac∣ticable
to lay a bridge of pontoons across the river, on
account of the floating ice, was obliged to transport his
troops in boats; and when all were passed, except him∣self,
with the rear-guard, consisting of three battalions, he
was, on the third day of December, in the morning, at∣tacked
by a strong body of Austrians, and taken, with all
his men, after an obstinate dispute. The King of Prussia,
weakened by these two successive defeats, that happened
in the rear of an unfortunate campaign, would hardly have
been able to maintain his ground at Freyberg, had not he
been at this juncture re-enforced by the body of troops
under the command of the Hereditary Prince of Bruns∣wick.
As for Daun, the advantages he had gained did
not elevate his mind above the usual maxims of his cautious
discretion. Instead of attacking the King of Prussia, re∣spectable
and formidable even in adversity, he quietly
occupied the strong camp at Pirna, where he might be
at hand to succour Dresden, in case it should be attacked,
and maintain his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112"/>
§ XXXIV. By this time the Russians had retired to
winter-quarters in Poland; and the Swedes, after a fruit∣less
excursion in the absence of Manteuffel, retreated to
Stralsund and the isle of Rugen. This campaign, there∣fore,
did not prove more decisive than the last. Abun∣dance
of lives were lost, and great part of Germany
was exposed to rapine, murther, famine, desolation,
and every species of misery that war could engender. In
vain the confederating powers of Austria, Russia, and
Sweden united their efforts to crush the Prussian monarch.
Though his army had been defeated, and he himself totally
overthrown, with great slaughter, in the heart of his own
dominions, though he appeared in a desperate situation,
environed by hostile armies, and two considerable detached
bodies of his troops were taken or destroyed; yet he kept
all his adversaries at bay till the approach of winter, which
proved his best auxiliary; and even maintained his foot∣ing
in the electorate of Saxony, which seemed to be the
prize contested between him and the Austrian general.
Yet, long before the approach of winter one would ima∣gine
he must have been crushed between the shock of so
many adverse hosts, had they been intent upon closing
him in, and heartily concurred for his destruction: but,
instead of urging the war with accumulated force, they
acted in seperate bodies, and with jealous eye seemed to
regard the progress of each other. It was not, therefore,
to any compunction, or kind forbearance, in the court of
Vienna, that the inactivity of Daun was owing. The
resentment of the House of Austria seemed, on the con∣trary,
to glow with redoubled indignation, and the ma∣jority
of the Germanick body seemed to enter with
warmth into her quarrel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The obstinacy of the powers in opposition to Great-Britain and Prussia appeared still more remarkable in their slighting the following declaration, which Duke Louis of Brunswick delivered to their ministers at the Hague, in the month of December, after Quebeck was reduced, and the fleet of France totally defeated.
“ Their Britannick and Prussian Majesties, moved with compassion at the mischiefs which the war that has been kindled for some years has already occasioned, and must necessarily produce, would think themselves wanting to the duties of humanity, and particularly to their tender concern for the preservation and well-being of their respective kingdoms and subjects, if they neglected the proper means to put a stop to the progress of so severe a ca∣lamity, and to contribute to the re-establishment of publick tranquillity. In this view, and in order to manifest the purity of their intention in this respect, their said Majesties have determined to make the following decla∣ration, viz.”

§ XXXV. When the protestant states in arms against
the court of Vienna were put under the ban of the Em∣pire,
the Evangelical body, though without the concur∣rence
of the Swedish and Danish ministers, issued an arret
at Ratisbon, in the month of November of the last year,
and to this annexed the twentieth article of the capitu∣lation
signed by the Emperor at his election, in order to
demonstrate that the protestant states claimed nothing
but what was agreeable to the constitution. They de∣clared
that their association was no more than a mutual
engagement, by which they obliged themselves to adhere
to the laws, without suffering, under any pretext, that the
power of putting under the ban of the Empire should re∣side
wholly in the Emperor. They affirmed that this
power was renounced, in express terms, by the capitula∣tion:
they, therefore, refused to admit, as legal, any sen∣tence
of the ban deficient in the requisite conditions;
and inferred, that, according to law, neither the Elector
of Brandenburg, nor the Elector of Hanover, nor the Duke
of Wolfenbuttel, nor the Landgrave of Hesse, nor the
Count of Lippe-Buckebourg, ought to be prescribed. The
Imperial protestant cities having acceded to this arret or
declaration, the Emperor, in a rescript, required them
to retract their accession to the resolution of the Evan∣gelick
body; which, it must be owned, was altogether
inconsistent with their former accession to the resolutions
of the diet against the King of Prussia. This rescript
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
having produced no effect, the arret was answered in Feb∣ruary
by an Imperial decree of commission carried to the
dictature, importing, that the Imperial court could not
longer hesitate about the execution of the ban, without
infringing that very article of the capitulation which they
had specified: that the invalidity of the arret was mani∣fest,
inasmuch as the Electors of Brandenburg and Bruns∣wick,
the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha and Brunswick-Wolfen∣buttel,
and the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, were the
very persons who disturbed the Empire; this, therefore,
being an affair in which they themselves were parties,
they could not possibly be qualified to concur in a reso∣lution
of this nature: besides, the number of the other
states which had acceded was very inconsiderable: for
these reasons, the Emperor could not but consider the
resolution in question as an act whereby the general peace
of the Empire was disturbed, both by the parties that had
incurred the ban, and by the states which had joined them,
in order to support and favour their frivolous pretensions.
His Imperial Majesty expressed his hope and confidence,
that the other electors, princes, and states of the Empire
would vote the said resolution to be null, and of no force;
and never suffer so small a number of states, who were
adherents of and abettors to the disturbers of the Empire,
to prejudice the rights and prerogatives of the whole Ger∣manick
body; to abuse the name of the associated estates
of the Augsbourg confession, in order forcibly to impose a
<HI>factum,</HI> entirely repugnant to the constitution of the Em∣pire;
to deprive their co-estates of the right of voting
freely, and thereby endeavouring totally to subvert the
system of the Germanick body. These remarks will
speak for themselves to the reflexion of the unprejudiced
reader.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The implacability of the court of Vienna
was equalled by nothing but the perseverance of the French
ministry. Though their numerous army had not gained
one inch of ground in Westphalia, the campaign on that
side having ended exactly where it had begun: though the
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
chief source of their commerce in the West-Indies had
fallen into the hands of Great-Britain, and they had al∣ready
laid their account with the loss of Quebeck: though
their coffers rung with emptiness, and their confederates
were clamorous for subsidies, they still resolved to maintain
the war in Germany; this was doubtless the most politick
resolution to which they could adhere, because their ene∣mies,
instead of exerting all their efforts where there was
almost a certainty of success, kindly condescended to seek
them where alone their whole strength could be advan∣tageously
employed, without any great augmentation of
their ordinary expense. Some of the springs of their na∣tional
wealth were indeed exhausted, or diverted into
other channels: but the subjects declared for a con∣tinuation
of the war, and the necessities of the state were
supplied by the loyalty and attachment of the people.
They not only acquiesced in the bankruptey of publick
credit, when the court stopped payment of the interest
on twelve different branches of the national debt, but
they likewise sent in large quantities of plate to be melted
down, and coined into specie, for the maintenance of the
war. All the bills drawn on the government by the co∣lonies
were protested, to an immense amount, and a stop
was put to all the annuities granted at Marseilles on sums
borrowed for the use of the marine. Besides the con∣siderable
savings occasioned by these acts of state bank∣ruptey,
they had resources of credit among the merchants
of Holland, who beheld the success of Great-Britain with
an eye of jealousy; and were moreover inslamed against
her with the most rancorous resentment, on account of
the captures which had been made of their West-India
ships by the English cruisers.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. In the month of February, the merchants
of Amsterdam, having received advice that the cargoes of
their West-India ships, detained by the English, would,
by the British courts of judicature, be declared lawful
prizes, as being French property, sent a deputation, with
a petition to the States-General, entreating them to use
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
their intercession with the court of London, representing
the impossibility of furnishing the proofs required in so
short a time as that prescribed by the British Admiralty;
and that, as the island of St. Eustatia had but one road,
and there was no other way of taking in cargoes but that
of Overschippen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method called Overschippen is that of using French boats to load <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utch vessels with the produce of France.</NOTE>, to which the English had objected, a
condemnation of these ships, as legal prizes, would give
the finishing stroke to the trade of the colony. Whatever
remonstrances the States-General might have made on
this subject to the ministry of Great-Britain, they had no
effect upon the proceedings of the court of Admiralty,
which continued to condemn the cargoes of the Dutch
ships as often as they were proved to be French property;
and this resolute uniformity in a little time intimidated the
subjects of Holland from persevering in this illicit branch
of commerce. The enemies of England in that republick,
however, had so far prevailed, that in the beginning of
the year the states of Holland had passed a formal
resolution to equip five-and-twenty ships of war; and or∣ders
were immediately dispatched to the officers of Admi∣ralty
to complete the armament with all possible expe∣dition.
In the month of April, the States-General sent
over to London three ministers extraordinary, to make
representations, and remove, if possible, the causes of mis∣understanding
that had arisen between Great-Britain and
the United Provinces. They delivered their credentials
to the King, with a formal harangue: they said his
Majesty would see, by the contents of the letter they had
the honour to present, how ardently their High Mighti∣nesses
desired to cultivate the sincere friendship which had
so long subsisted between the two nations, so necessary for
their common welfare and preservation: they expressed an
earnest wish that they might be happy enough to remove
those difficulties which had for some time struck at this
friendship, and caused so much prejudice to the principal
subjects of the Republick: who, by the commerce they
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
carried on, constituted its greatest strength, and chief
support. They declared their whole confidence was
placed in his Majesty's equity, for which the Republick
had the highest regard, and in the good-will he had al∣ways
expressed towards a state which, on all occasions, had
interested itself in promoting his glory; a state which was
the guardian of the precious trust be queathed by a princess so
dear to his affection.—“Full of this confidence (said they)
we presume to flatter ourselves that your Majesty will be
graciously pleased to listen to our just demands; and we
shall endeavour, during the course of our ministry, to
merit your approbation, in strengthening the bonds by
which the two nations ought to be for ever united.” In
answer to this oration, the King assured them that he had
always regarded their High Mightinesses as his best
friends. He said, if difficulties had arisen concerning
trade, they ought to be considered as the consequences of
a burthensome war which he was obliged to wage with
France. He desired they would assure their High Mighti∣nesses,
that he should endeavour, on his part, to remove
the obstacles in question, and expressed his satisfaction,
that they (the deputies) were come over with the same
disposition. What representations these deputies made,
further than complaints of some irregularities in the con∣duct
of the British sea-officers, we cannot pretend to spe∣cify:
but as the subject in dispute related entirely to the
practice of the courts of judicature, it did not fall properly
under the cognizance of the government, which hath no
right to interfere with the administration of justice. In
all probability, the subjects of Holland were by no means
pleased with the success of this negociation, for they mur∣mured
against the English nation without ceasing. They
threatened and complained by turns, and eagerly seised
all opportunities of displaying their partiality in favour
of the enemies of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. In the month of September Major-Gene∣ral
Yorke, the British minister at the Hague, presented a
memorial to the States-General, remonstrating, that the
merchants of Holland carried on a contraband trade in
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
favour of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> by transporting cannon and warlike
stores from the Baltic to Holland, in Dutch bottoms,
under the borrowed names of private persons; and then
conveying them by the inland rivers and canals, or through
the Dutch fortresses, to Dunkirk, and other places of
France. He desired that the King his master might be
made easy on that head, by their putting an immediate
stop to such practices, so repugnant to the connexions
subsisting by treaty between Great Britain and the United
Province, as well as to every idea of neutrality. He ob∣served
that the attention which his Majesty had lately
given to their representations against the excesses of the
English privateers, by procuring an act of parliament
which laid them under proper restrictions, gave him a
good title to the same regard on the part of their High
Mightinesses. He reminded them that their trading towns
felt the good effects of these restrictions; and that the
freedom of navigation which their subjects enjoyed amidst
the troubles and distractions of Europe had considerably
augmented their commerce. He observed, that some re∣turn
ought to be made to such solid proofs of the King's
friendship and moderation; at least, the merchants, who
were so ready to complain of England, ought not be coun∣tenanced
in excesses which would have justified the most
rigorous examination of their conduct. He recalled to
their memories, that, during the course of the present
war, the King had several times applied to their High
Mightinesses, and to their ministers, on the liberty they
had given to carry stores through the fortresses of the
republick for the use of France, to invade the British do∣minions;
and though his Majesty had passed over in silence
many of these instances of complaisance to his enemy, he
was no less sensible of the injury; but he chose rather to
be a sufferer himself, than to encrease the embarrassment
of his neighbours, or extend the flames of war. He took
notice, that even the court of Vienna had, upon more than
one occasion, employed its interest with their High Mighti∣nesses,
and sent its name to obtain passes for warlike stores
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
and provisions for the French troops, under colour of the
Barrier-Treaty, which it no longer observed: nay, after
having put France in possession of Ostend and Nieuport,
in manifest violation of that treaty, and without any re∣gard
to the rights which they and the King his master
had acquired in that treaty, at the expense of so much
blood and treasure.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The memorial seems to have made some
impression on the States-General, as they scrupled to al∣low
the artillery and stores belonging to the French King
to be removed from Amsterdam: but these scruples va∣nished
entirely on the receipt of a counter-memorial pre∣sented
by the Count d'Assry, the French ambassador,
who mingled some effectual threats with his expostulation.
He desired them to remember, that, during the whole
course of the war, the French King had required nothing
from their friendship that was inconsistent with the strictes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
impartiality: and if he deviated from the engagements
subsisting between him and the republick, it was only by
granting the most essential and lucrative favours to the
subjects of their High Mightinesses. He observed that
the English, notwithstanding the insolence of their beha∣viour
to the republick, had derived, on many occasions,
assistance from the protection their effects had found in
the territories of the United Provinces; that the artillery,
stores and ammunition belonging to Wessel were deposited
in their territories, which the Hanoverian army in passing
the Rhine had very little respected: that when they re∣passed
that river, they had no other way of saving their
sick and wounded from the hands of the French, than by
embarking them in boats, and conveying them to places
where the French left them unmolested, actuated by their
respect for the neutrality of the republick: that part of
their magazines was still deposited in the towns of the
United Provinces; where also the enemies of France had
purchased and contracted for very considerable quantities
of gunpowder. He told them, that though these and seve∣ral
other circumstances might have been made the subject
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
of the justest complaints, the King of France did not
think it proper to require that the freedom and indepen∣dency
of the subjects of the republic should be restrained
in branches of commerce that were not inconsistent with
its neutrality, persuaded that the faith of an engagement
ought to be inviolably preserved, though attended with
some accidental and transient disadvantage; he gave
them to understand, that the King his master had ordered
the generals of his army carefully to avoid encroaching
on the territory of the republick, and transferring thither
the theatre of the war, when his enemies retreated that way
before they were forced to repass the Rhine. After such
unquestionable marks of regard, he said, his king would
have the justest ground of complaint, if, contrary to ex∣pectation,
he should hear that the artillery and stores be∣longing
to him were detained at Amsterdam. Thirdly,
he declared that such detention would be construed as a
violation of the neutrality; and demanded, in the name
of the king his master, that the artillery and stores should,
without delay, be forwarded to Flanders by the canals of
Amsterdam and the inland navigation. This last argu∣ment
was so conclusive, that they immediately granted
the necessary passports, in consequence of which the can∣non
were conveyed to the Austrian Netherlands.</P>
<P>§ XL. The powers in the southern parts of Europe were
too much engrossed with their own concerns to interest
themselves deeply in the quarrels that distracted the German
empire. The King of Spain, naturally of a melancho <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
complexion and delicate constitution, was so deeply
affected with the loss of his Queen, who died in the course
of the preceding year, that he renounced all company,
neglected all business, and immured himself in a chamber
at Villa-Viciosa, where he gave a loose to the most ex∣travagant
sorrow. He abstained from food and rest until
his strength was quite exhausted. He would neither shift
himself, nor allow his beard to be shaved: he rejected all
attempts of consolation, and remained deaf to the most
earnest and respectful remonstrances of those who had a
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
right to tender their advice. In this case, the affliction
of the mind must have been re-enforced by some peculia∣rity
in the constitution. He inherited a melancholy taint
from his father, and this seems to have been dreaded as a
family disease; for the Infant Don Louis, who likewise
resided at the palace of Villa-Viciosa, was fain to amuse
himself with hunting, and other diversions, to provent
his being infected with the King's disorder, which con∣tinued
to gain ground, notwithstanding all the efforts of
medicine. The Spanish nation, naturally superstitious,
had recourse to saints and relicks; but they seemed in∣sensible
to all their devotion. The King, however, in
the midst of all his distress, was prevailed upon to make
his will, which was written by the Count de Valparaiso,
and signed by the Duke de Bejar, high-chancellor of the
kingdom. The exorbitancy of his grief, and the mor∣tifications
he underwent, soon produced an incurable
malady, under which he languished from the month of
September in the preceding year till the tenth of August
in the present, when he expired. In his will he had ap∣pointed
his brother Don Carlos, King of Naples, suc∣cessor
to the crown of Spain; and nominated the Queen
Dowager as regent of the kingdom, until that prince should
arrive. Accordingly, she assumed the reins of govern∣ment,
and gave directions for the funeral of the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ased
king, who was interred with great pomp in the church
belonging to the convent of the Visitation at Madrid.</P>
<P>§ XLI. As the death of this prince had been long ex∣pected,
so the politicians of Europe had universally prog∣nosticated
that his demise would be attended with great
commotions in Italy. It had been agreed among the
subscribing powers to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, that
in case Don Carlos should be advanced in the course of
succession to the throne of Spain, his brother Don l'hilip
should succeed him on the throne of Naples; and the
duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, which now
constituted his establishment, should revert to the house
of Austria. The King of Naples had never acceded to
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
this article, therefore he paid no regard to it on the death
of his elder▪ brother; but retained both kingdoms, with∣out
minding the claims of the Empress-Queen, who, he
knew, was at that time in no condition to support her pre∣tensions.
Thus the German war proved a circumstance
very favourable to his interest and ambition. Before he
embarked for Spain, however, he took some extraordina∣ry
steps, which evinced him a sound politician and sagaci∣ous
legislator. His eldest son Don Philip, who had now at∣tained
the thirteenth year of his age, being found in a state
of incurable ideotism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Abstract of the report made to his Catholick Majesty by the physicians appoint∣ed to examine the Prince Royal, his eldest son, in consequence of which his royal highness was declared incapable of succeeding to the throne of Spain. Translated from the criginal, published at Naples, Sept.</HI> 27.
1. Though his Royal Highness Don Philip is thirteen years old, he is of low stature, and yet the King his father, and the Queen his mother, are both of a very proper height.
2. His Royal Highness has some contraction in his joints, though he can readily move, and make use of them on all occasions.
3. His Royal Highness is apt to stoop and hold down his head, as peo∣ple of weak eyes often do.
4. The prince most evidently squints, and his eyes frequently water and are gummy, particularly his left eye: though we cannot say he is blind, but are rather certain of the contrary, as his Royal Highness can without doubt dis∣tinguish objects, both as to their colour and situation.
5. In his natural functions, and the most common sensations, he is some∣times indifferent to things that are convenient for him, and at other times is too warm and impetuous. In general, his passions are not restrained by reason.
6. The prince has an obstinate aversion to some kind of common food, such as fruits, sweetmeats, &amp;c.
7. All sorts of noise or sound disturb and disconcert him; and it has the same effect whether it be soft and harmonious, or harsh and disagreeable.
8. The impressions that he receives from pain or pleasure are neither strong nor lasting, and he is utterly unacquainted with all the punctilios of polite∣ness and good breeding.
9. As to facts and places, he sometimes remembers them and sometimes not; but he seems not to have the least idea of the mysteries of our holy
religion.
10. He delights in childish amusements; and those which are most boiste∣vous please him best. He is continually changing them, and shifting from one thing to another. Signed by Don Francis Beniore, chief physician to the King and kingdom▪ Don Emmanuel de la Rosa, physician to the Queen: and the physicians Cae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar Citibue, Don Thomas Pinto, Don Francis Sarrao, and Don Do∣minique San Severino.</NOTE> he wisely and resolutely removed
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
him from the succession, without any regard to the pre∣tended
right of primogeniture, by a solemn act of abdi∣cation,
and settlement of the crown of the Two Sicilies
in favour of his third son, Don Ferdinend. In this extra∣ordinary
act he observes, That, according to the spirit of
the treaties of this age, Europe required that the sove∣reignty
of Spain should be separated from that of Italy,
when such a separation could be effected without trans∣gressing
the rules of justice: that the unfortunate prince-royal
having been destitute of reason and reflexion ever
since his infancy, and no hope remaining that he could
ever acquire the use of these faculties, he could not think
of appointing him to the succession, how agreeable soever
such a disposition might be to nature and his paternal
affection: he was, therefore, constrained, by the Divine
Will, to set him aside, in favour of his third son, Don
Ferdinand, whose minority obliged him to vest the manage∣ment
of these realms in a regency, which he accordingly
appointed, after having previously declared <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-son Ferdi∣nand
from that time emancipated, and freed not only
from all obedience to his paternal power, but even from
all submission to his supreme and sovereign authority.
He then decreed, that the minority of the prince <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies should expire with
the fifteenth year of his age, when he should act as
sovereign, and have the entire power of the administration.
He next established and explained the order of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in the male and female line; on condition that the monar∣chy
of Spain should never be united with the kingdoms of
the Two Sicilies. Finally, he transferred and made over
to the said Don Ferdinand these kingdoms, with all that
he possessed in Italy; and this ordinance, signed and
sealed by himself and the Insant Don Ferdinand, and
counter-signed by the counsellors and secretaries of state,
in quality of members of the regency, received all the
usual forms of authenticity. Don Carlos having taken
these precautions for the benefit of his third son, whom
he left King of Naples, embarked with the rest of his
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
family on board a squadron of Spanish ships, which con∣veyed
him to Barcelona. There he landed in the month
of October, and proceeded to Madrid, where, as King of
Spain, he was received amidst the acclamations of his
people. He began his reign, like a wise prince, by regu∣lating
the interior oeconomy of his kingdom; by pursuing
the plan adopted by his predecessor; by retaining the
ministry under whose auspices the happiness and commerce
of his people had been extended; and, with respect to the
belligerent powers, by scrupulously adhering to that neu∣trality
from whence these advantages were in a great mea∣sure
derived.</P>
<P>§ XLII. While he serenely enjoyed the blessings of
prosperity, his neighbour the King of Portugal was en∣grossed
by a species of employment, which, of all others,
must be the most disagreeable to a prince of sentiment,
who loves his people; namely, the trial and punishment of
those conspirators, by whose atrocious attempt his life
had been so much endangered. Among these were num∣bered
some of the first noblemen of the kingdom, irritated
by disappointed ambition, inflamed by bigotry, and exas∣perated
by revenge. The principal conspirator, Don
Joseph Mascare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as and Lencastre, Duke de Aveiro,
Marquis of Torres Novas, and Conde of Santa Cruz,
was hereditary lord-steward of the King's houshold, and
president of the palace-court, or last tribunal of appeal
in the kingdom; so that he possessed the first office at the
palace, and the second of the realm. Francisco de Assiz,
Marquis of Tavora, Conde of St. John and Alvor, was
general of the horse, and head of the third noble house
of the Tavoras, the most illustrious family in the king∣dom,
deriving their origin from the ancient Kings of
Leon; he married his own kinswoman, who was Marchi∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess
of Tavora in her own right, and by this marriage
acquired the marquisate. Louis Bernardo de Tavora was
their eldest son, who, by virtue of a dispensation from the
Pope, had espoused his own aunt, Donna Theresa de
Tavora. Joseph Maria de Tavora, his youngest brother,
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
was also involved in the guilt of his parents. The third
principal concerned was Don Jeronymo de Attaide, Conde
of Attouguia, himself a relation, and married to the eldest
daughter of the Marquis of Tavora. The characters
of all these personages were unblemished and respectable,
until this machination was detected. In the course of
investigating this dark affair, it appeared that the Duke
de Averio had conceived a personal hatred to the King,
who had disappointed him in a projected match between
his son and a sister of the Duke de Cadaval, a minor,
and prevented his obtaining some commanderies which the
late Duke de Aveiro had possessed: that this nobleman,
being determined to gratify his revenge against the person
of his sovereign, had exerted all his art and address in se∣curing
the participation of the malcontents: that with
this view, he reconciled himself to the Jesuits, with whom
he had been formerly at variance, knowing they were at
this time implacably incensed against the King, who had
dismissed them from their office of penitentiaries at court,
and branded them with other marks of disgrace, on ac∣count
of their illegal and rebellious practices in South
America: the Duke, moreover, insinuated himself into
the confidence of the Marchioness of Tavora, notwith∣standing
an inveterate rivalship of pride and ambition,
which had long subsisted between the two families.
Her resentment against the King was inflamed by the
mortification of her pride in repeated repulses, when she
sollicited the title of duke for her husband. Her passion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were artfully fomented and managed by the Jesuits, to
whom she had resigned the government of her conscience
and they are said to have persuaded her, that it would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
meritorious action to take away the life of a prince who
was an enemy to the church, and a tyrant to his people▪
She, being reconciled to the scheme of assassination, ex∣erted
her influence in such a manner as to inveigle her
husband, her sons, and son-in-law into the same infa∣mous
design; and yet this lady always had been remark∣able
for her piety, assability, and sweetness of disposition▪
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
Many consultations were held by the conspirators at the
colleges of the Jesuits, St. Antoa, and St. Roque, as well
as at the houses of the Duke and the Marquis. At last,
they resolved that the King should be assassinated; and
employed two ruffians, called Antonio Alvarez and Jo∣seph
Policarpio, for the execution of this design, the
miscarriage of which we have related among the trans∣actions
of the preceding year. In the beginning of Janu∣ary,
before the circumstances of the conspiracy were
known, the Counts de Oberas and de Ribeira Grande
were imprisoned in the castle of St. Julian, on a suspicion
arising from their freedom of speech. The Duchess de
Aveiro, the Countess of Attouguia, and the Marchioness
of Alorna, with their children, were sent to different
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unneries; and eight Jesuits were taken into custody.
A council being appointed for the trial of the prisoners,
the particulars we have related were brought to light by
the torture; and sentence of death was pronounced and
executed upon the convicted criminals. Eight wheels
were fixed upon a scaffold, raised in the square opposite to
the house where the prisoners had been confined, and the
thirteenth of January was fixed for the day of execution.
Antonio Alvarez Ferreira, one of the assassins who had
fired into the King's equipage, was fixed to a stake at
one corner of the scaffold; and at the other was placed the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gies of his accomplice, Joseph Policarpio de Azevedo,
who had made his escape. The Marchioness of Tavora,
being brought upon the scaffold between eight and nine
in the morning, was beheaded at one stroke, and then
covered with a linen cloth. Her two sons, and her son-in-law,
the Count of Attouguia, with three servants of
the Duke de Aveiro, were first strangled at one stake,
and afterwards broke upon wheels, where their bodies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
covered: but the Duke and the Marquis, as chiefs
of the conspiracy, were broke alive, and under went the
most excruciating torments. The last that suffered was
the assassin Alvarez, who being condemned to be burnt
alive, the combustibles which had been placed under the
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
scaffold were set on fire, the whole machine with their
bodies consumed to ashes, and these ashes thrown into the
sea. The estates of the three unfortunate noblemen were
confiscated, and their dwelling-houses rased to the ground.
The name of Tavora was suppressed for ever by a publick
decree; but that of Mascarenhas spared, because the
Duke de Aveiro was a younger branch of the family. A
reward of ten thousand crowns was offered to any person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who should apprehend the assassin who had escaped: then
the embargo was taken off the shipping. The King and
royal family assisted at a publick <HI>Te Deum</HI> sung in the
chapel of Nossa Senhora de Livramento on which oc∣casion
the King, for the satisfaction of his people, waved
his handkerchief with both hands, to shew he was not
maimed by the wounds he had received. If such an at∣tempt
upon the life of a king was infamously cruel and
perfidious, it must be owned that the punishment in∣flicted
upon the criminals was horrible to human nature.
The attempt itself was attended with some circumstances
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might have staggered belief, had it not appeared but
too plain that the King was actually wounded. One
would imagine, that the Duke de Aveiro, who was charged
with designs on the crown, would have made some pre∣parations
for taking advantage of the confusion and dis∣order
which must have been produced by the King's
assassination; but we do not find that any thing of this
nature was premeditated. It was no more than a despe∣rate
scheme of personal revenge, conceived without cau∣tion,
and executed without conduct: a circumstance that
more extraordinary, if we suppose the conspirators were
actuated by the councils of the Jesuits, who have been
ever famous for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esse and dexterity. Besides the dis∣covery
of all the particulars was founded upon consession
extorted by the rack, which, at best, is a suspicious evi∣dence.
Be that as it will, the Portuguese government,
without waiting for a bull from the Pope, sequestered all the
estates and effects of the Jesuits in that kingdom, which
amounted to considerable sums, and reduced the indivi∣duals
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
of the society to a very scanty allowance. Com∣plaints
of their conduct having been made to the Pope, he appointed a congregation to examine into the affairs of
the Jesuits in Portugal. In the mean time, the court of
Lisbon ordered a considerable number of them to be em∣barked
for Italy, and resolved that no Jesuit should here∣after
reside within its realms. When these transports
arrived at Civita-Vecchia, they were, by the Pope's order,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odged in the Dominican and Capuchin convents of that
city, until proper houses could be prepared for their recep∣tion
at Tivoli and Frescati. The most guilty of them,
however, were detained in close prison in Portugal, re∣served,
in all probability, for a punishment more adequate
to their enormities.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. England still continued to enjoy the blessings
of peace, even amidst the triumphs of war. In the month
of November the session of parliament was opened by
commission; and, the Commons attending in the House
of Peers, the Lord-Keeper harangued the parliament to
this effect: he gave them to understand that his Majesty
had directed him to assure them that he thought himself
peculiarly happy in being able to convoke them in a situa∣tion
of affairs so glorious to his crown, and advantageous
to his kingdoms: that the King saw and devoutly adored
the hand of Providence, in the many signal successes both
by sea and land with which his arms had been blessed in
the course of the last campaign: that he reflected with
great satisfaction on the confidence which the parliament
had placed in him, by making such ample provisions, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntrusting him with such extensive powers for carrying
on a war, which the defence of their valuable rights and
possessions, together with the preservation of the commerce
of his people, had rendered both just and necessary. He
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>numerated the late successes of the British arms, the re∣duction
of Goree on the coast of Africa, the conquest of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o many important places in America, the defeat of the
French army in Canada, the reduction of their capital city
Quebeck, effected with so much honour to the courage
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
and conduct of his Majesty's officers and forces, the im∣portant
advantage obtained by the British squadron of
Cape-Lagos, and the effectual blocking up for so many
months the principal part of the French navy in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
own harbours; events which must have filled the hearts o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all his Majesty's faithful subjects with the sincerest joy
and convinced his parliament that there had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
want of vigilance or vigour on his part, in exerting thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
means which they, with so much prudence and publick
spirited zeal, had put into his Majesty's hands. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
observed, that the national advantages had extended ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
as far as the East-Indies, where, by the Divine Blessing
the dangerous designs of his Majesty's enemies had mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣carried,
and that valuable branch of commerce had re∣ceived
great benefit and protection. That the memora∣ble
victory gained over the French at Minden had lon▪
made a deep impression on the minds of his Majesty's peo∣ple.
that if the crisis in which the battle was fought, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
superiour number of the enemy, the great and able con∣duct
of his Majesty's general, Prince Ferdinand of Bruns∣wick,
were considered, that action must be the subject o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lasting admiration and thankfulness: that if any thing
could fill the breasts of his Majesty's good subjects with
still further degrees of exultation, it would be the di∣stinguished
and unbroken valour of the British troops
owned and applauded by those whom they overcame. He
said the glory they had gained was not merely their own
but, in a national view, was one of the most important
circumstances of our success, as it must be a striking ad∣monition
to our enemies with whom they have to contend.
He told them that his Majesty's good brother and ally, the
King of Prussia, attacked and surrounded by so many
considerable powers, had, by his magnanimity and abi∣lities,
and the bravery of his troops, been able, in a sur∣prising
manner, to prevent the mischiefs concerted with
such united force against him. He declared, by the com∣mand
of his sovereign, that as his Majesty entered into
this war not from views of ambition, so he did not wish to
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
continue it from motives of resentment: that the desire of
his Majesty's heart was to see a stop put to the effusion of
Christian blood: that, whenever such terms of peace
could be established as should be just and honourable for
his Majesty and his allies; and by procuring such ad∣vantages
as, from the successes of his Majesty's arms,
might in reason and equity be expected, should bring
along with them full security for the future, his Majesty
would rejoice to see the repose of Europe restored on such
solid and durable foundations; and his faithful subjects,
to whose liberal support and unshaken firmness his Ma∣jesty
owed so much, happy in the enjoyment of the
blessings of peace and tranquillity: but, in order to this
great and desireable end, he said his Majesty was confident
the parliament would agree with him, that it was necessary
to make ample provision for carrying on the war, in all
parts, with the utmost vigour. He assured the Commons,
that the great supplies they had granted in the last session of
parliament had been faithfully employed for the purposes
for which they were granted; but the uncommon extent
of the war, and the various services necessary to be pro∣vided
for, in order to secure success to his Majesty's mea∣sures,
had unavoidably occasioned extraordinary expenses.
Finally, he repeated the assurances from the throne of the
high satisfaction his Majesty took in that union and
good harmony which was so conspicuous among his good
subjects; he said, his sovereign was happy in seeing it
continued and confirmed; he observed, that experience
had shown how much the nation owed to this union,
which alone could secure the true happiness of his people.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. We shall not anticipate the reader's own
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by pretending to comment upon either the mat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
or the form of this harangue, which, however, pro∣duced
all the effect which the sovereign could desire. The
Houses, in their respective addresses, seemed to vie with
each other in expressions of attachment and complacency.
The Peers professed their utmost readiness to concur in
the effectual support of such further measures as his Ma∣jesty,
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
in his great wisdom, should judge necessary or expe∣dient
for carrying on the war with vigour, in all parts,
and for disappointing and repelling any desperate attempt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which might be made upon these kingdoms. The Com∣mons
expressed their admiration of that true greatness of
mind which disposed his Majesty's heart, in the midst of
prosperities, to wish a stop put to the effusion of Christian
blood, and to see tranquillity restored. They declared
their entire reliance on his Majesty's known wisdom and
firmness, that this desireable object, whenever it should be
obtained, would be upon terms just and honourable for his
Majesty and his allies; and, in order to effect that great
end, they assured him they would chearfully grant such
supplies as should be found necessary to sustain, and press
with effect, all his extensive operations against the enemy.
They did not fail to re-echo the speech, as usual, enume∣rating
the trophies of the year, and extolling the King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Prussia for his consummate genius, magnanimity, un∣wearied
activity, and unshaken constancy of mind. Very
great reason, indeed, had his Majesty to be satisfied with an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
address of such a nature from a House of Commons, in
which opposition lay strangled at the foot of the minister<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in which those demagogues, who had raised themselves to
reputation and renown, by declaiming against continenta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
measures, were become so perfectly reconciled to the ob∣ject
of their former reprobation, as to cultivate it even
with a degree of enthusiasm unknown to any former ad∣ministration,
and lay the nation under such contributions
in its behalf as no other ministry durst ever meditate▪
Thus disposed, it was no wonder they admired the mo∣deration
of their sovereign, in offering to treat of peace▪
after above a million of men had perished by the war, and
twice that number been reduced to misery; after whole
provinces had been depopulated, whole countries subdued<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and the victors themselves almost crushed by the trophie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they had gained.</P>
<P>§ XLV. Immediately after the addresses were presented <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Commons resolved themselves into a committee o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
the whole House, and having unanimously voted a supply
to his Majesty, began to take the particulars into consi∣deration.
This committee was continued till the twelfth
of May, when that whole business was accomplished.
For the service of the ensuing year they voted seventy
thousand seamen; including eighteen thousand three hun∣dred
and fifty-five marines; and for their maintenance
allotted three millions six hundred and forty thousand
pounds. The number of land forces, including the Bri∣tish
troops in Germany, and the invalids, they fixed at
fifty-seven thousand two hundred and ninety-four men,
and granted for their subsistence one million three hundred
eighty-three thousand seven hundred and forty-eight pounds
and ten pence. For maintaining other forces in the
plantations, Gibraltar, Guadaloupe, Africa, and the East-Indies,
they allowed eight hundred forty-six thousand one
hundred and sixty-eight pounds, nineteen shillings: for
the expense of four regiments on the Irish establishment,
serving in North-America, they voted thirty-five thou∣sand
seven hundred and forty-four pounds, eight shillings,
and four-pence. For pay to the general and general
staff-officers, and officers of the hospital for the land forces,
they assigned fifty-four thousand four hundred and fifty-four
pounds, eleven shillings, and nine-pence. They voted
for the expense of the militia in South and North-Britain
the sum of one hundred two thousand and six pounds, four
shillings, and eight-pence. They granted for the main∣tenance
of thirty-eight thousand seven hundred and fifty
men, being the troops of Hanover, Wolfen buttel, Saxe-Gotha,
and Buckebourg, retained in the service of Great-Britain,
the sum of four hundred forty-seven thousand
eight hundred eighty-two pounds, ten shillings, and five-pence
half-penny; and for nineteen thousand Hessian
troops, in the same pay, they gave three hundred sixty-six
thousand seven hundred twenty-five pounds, one shilling,
and six-pence. They afterwards bestowed the sum of
one hundred eight thousand and twelve pounds, twelve
shillings, and seven-pence, for defraying the additional
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
expense of augmentations in the troops of Hanover and
Hesse, and the British army serving in the Empire. For
the ordinary of the navy, including half-pay to sea officers;
for carrying on the building of two hospitals, one near
Gosport, and the other in the neighbourhood of Ply∣mouth;
for the support of the hospital at Greenwich; for
purchasing ground, erecting wharfs, and other accommo∣dations
necessary for refitting the fleets at Halifax, in No∣va-Scotia:
for the charge of the office of Ordnance, and
defraying the extraordinary expense incurred by that office
in the course of the last year, they allowed seven hundred
eighty-one thousand four hundred and eighty-nine
pounds, six shillings, and six-pence. Towards paying off
the navy debt, buildings, re-buildings, and repairs of the
King's ships, together with the charge of transport-service,
they granted one million seven hundred and one thousand
seventy-eight pounds, sixteen shillings, and six-pence.
For defraying the extraordinary expenses of the land∣forces,
and other services not provided for by parliament,
comprehending the pensions for the widows of reduced
officers, they allotted the sum of nine hundred fifty-five
thousand three hundred and forty-four pounds, fifteen shil∣lings,
and five-pence halfpenny. They voted one million,
to empower his Majesty to discharge the like sum, raised
in pursuance of an actmade in the last seassion of parliament,
and charged upon the first aids or supplies to be granted in
this session of parliament. They gave six hundred and
seventy thousand pounds for enabling his Majesty to make
good his engagements with the King of Prussia, pursuant
to a new convention between him and that monarch, con∣cluded
on the ninth day of November in the present year▪
Fifteen thousand pounds they allowed, upon account, to∣wards
enabling the principal officers of his Majesty's Ord∣nance
to defray the necessary charges and expenses of
taking down and removing the present magazine for gun∣powder,
situated in the neighbourhood of Greenwich, and
of erecting it in some less dangerous situation. Sixty
thousand pounds they gave, to enable his Majesty to fulfill
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
his engagements with the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, pur∣suant
to the separate article of a treaty between the two
powers, renewed in the month of November; the sum to
be paid as his most Serene Highness should think it most
convenient, in order to facilitate the means by which the
Landgrave might again fix his residence in his own do∣minions,
and by his presence give fresh courage to his
faithful subjects. Five hundred thousand pounds they
voted, upon account, as a present supply towards defray∣ing
the charges of forage, bread, bread-waggons, train of
artillery, wood, straw, provisions, and contingencies of
his Majesty's combined army under the command of
Prince Ferdinand. To the Foundling-hospital they grant∣ed
five thousand pounds: and fifteen thousand for im∣proving,
widening, and enlarging the passage over and
through London-bridge. To replace divers sums taken
from the sinking-fund, they granted two hundred twenty-five
thousand two hundred and eighty-one pounds, nineteen
shillings, and four-pence. For the subsistence of reduced
officers, including the allowances to the several officers
and private men of the two troops of horse-guards and
regiment of horse reduced, and to the superannuated gen∣tlemen
of the four troops of horse-guards, they voted
thirty-eight thousand five hundred and ninety-seven
pounds, nine shillings. Upon account, for the support of
the colonies of Nova-Scotia and Georgia, they granted
twenty-one thousand six hundred ninety-four pounds, two
shillings, and two-pence. For enabling the King to give
a proper compensation to the provinces of North-Ame∣rica
for the expenses they might incur in levying and
maintaining troops, according as the vigour and activity
of those respective provinces should be thought by his
Majesty to merit, they advanced the sum of two hundred
thousand pounds. The East-India company they gratified
with twenty thousand pounds, towards enabling them to
defray the expense of a military force in their settlements,
in lieu of a battalion of the King's troops now returned
to Ireland. Twenty-five thousand pounds were provided
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
for the payment of the out-pensioners of Chelsea-hospital.
For subsequent augmentations of the British forces, since
the first estimate of guards and garrisons for the ensuing
year was presented, they allowed one hundred thirty-four
thousand one hundred thirty-nine pounds, seventeen shil∣lings,
and four-pence. They further voted, upon account,
towards enabling the governours and guardians of the
Foundling-hospital to maintain, educate, and bind ap∣prentice
the children admitted into the said charity, the
sum of forty-seven thousand two hundred and eighty-five
pounds. For defraying the expense of maintaining the
militia in South and North-Britain, to the twenty-fourth
day of December of the ensuing year, they voted an ad∣ditional
grant of two hundred ninety thousand eight
hundred and twenty-six pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight-pence:
and, nio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they granted fourscore thousand
pounds, upon account, towards defraying the charge of
pay and clothing of the unembodied militia for the year,
ending on the twenty-fifth day of March, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-one. For re-embursing
the colony of New-York their expenses in furnishing pro∣visions
and stores to the troops raised by them for his Ma∣jesty's
service, in the campaign of the year one thousand
seven hundred and fifty-six, they allowed two thousand
nine hundred and seventy-seven pounds, seven shillings, and
eight-pence: and for maintaining the British forts and
settlements on the coast of Africa they renewed the grant
of ten thousand pounds. For the maintenance and aug∣mentation
of the troops of Brunswick in the pay o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Great-Britain, for the ensuing year, pursuant to an ulte∣rior
convention concluded and signed at Paderborn, on the
fifth day of March, in the year one thousand seven hundred
and sixty, they granted the sum of ninety thousand seven
hundred and sixty-nine pounds, eight shillings, and eleven-pence
farthing; and for the troops of Hesse-Cassel in the
same pay, during the same period, they allotted one hun∣dred
and one thousand ninety-six pounds, three shillings,
and two-pence. For the extraordinary expenses of the
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
land forces, and other services incurred, from the twenty-fourth
day of November in the present year to the twenty-fourth
of December following, and not provided for, they
granted the sum of four hundred twenty thousand one hun∣dred
and twenty pounds, one shilling. To make good
the deficiency of the grants for the service of this present
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine, they
assigned the sum of seventy-five thousand one hundred
and seventy pounds, three pence farthing. For printing
the journals of the House of Commons they gave five
thousand pounds; and six hundred thirty-four pounds,
thirteen shillings, and seven-pence, as interest, at the rate of
four per centum per annum, from the twenty-fifth day of
August in the present year, to the same day of April next,
for the sum of twenty-three thousand eight hundred pounds,
eleven shillings, and eleven-pence, remaining in the office
of Ordnance, and not paid into the hands of the deputy of
the King's remembrancer of the court of Exchequer, as
directed by an act made in the last session of parliament,
to make compensation for lands and hereditaments pur∣chased
for his Majesty's service at Chatham, Portsmouth,
and Plymouth, by reason of doubts and difficulties which
had arisen touching the execution of the said act. For
defraying the extraordinary charge of the Mint, during the
present year, they allowed eleven thousand nine hundred
and forty pounds, thirteen shillings, and ten-pence; and
two thousand five hundred pounds, upon account, for
paying the debts claimed and sustained upon a forfeited
estate in North-Britain. They likewise allowed twelve
thousand eight hundred and seventy-four pounds, fifteen
shillings, and ten-pence, for defraying the charge of a
regiment of light dragoons, and of an additional company
to the corps commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan.
Finally, they voted one million, upon account, to enable
the King to defray any extraordinary expenses of the war,
incurred or to be incurred for the service of the year one
thousand seven hundred and sixty; and to take all such
measures as might be necessary to defeat any enter∣prise
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
or designs of his enemies, as the exigency of affair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
might require. On the whole, the sum total granted in
this session of parliament amounted to fifteen millions
five hundred three thousand five hundred and sixty-three
pounds, fifteen shillings, and nine-pence halfpenny: a
sum so enormous, whether we consider the nation that
raised it, or the purposes for which it was raised, that
every Briton of a sedate mind, attached to the interest and
welfare of his country, must reflect upon it with equal
astonishment and concern: a sum considerably more than
double the largest subsidy that was granted in the reign of
Queen Anne, when the nation was in the zenith of her
glory, and retained half the powers of Europe in her pay:
a sum almost double of what any former administration
durst have asked; and near double of what the most
sanguine calculators who lived in the beginning of this
century thought the nation could give without the most
imminent hazard of immediate bankruptey. Of the im∣mense
supply which we have particularised, the reader
will perceive that two millions three hundred forty-four
thousand four hundred and eighty-six pounds, sixteen
shillings, and seven-pence three farthings were paid to
foreigners for supporting the war in Germany, exclusive
of the money expended by the British troops in that coun∣try,
the number of which amounted, in the course of the
ensuing year, to twenty thousand men; a number the more
extraordinary, if we consider they were all transported to
that continent during the administration of those who de∣clared
in parliament (the words still sounding in our ears) that
not a man, nor even half a man, should be sent from
Great-Britain to Germany, to fight the battles of any
foreign elector. Into the expense of the German wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sustained by Great-Britain we must also throw the charge
of transporting the English troops, the article of forage,
which alone amounted, in the course of the last campaign,
to one million two hundred thousand pounds, besides pon∣tage,
waggons, horses, and many other contingencies.
To the German war we may also impute the extraordinary
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
expense incurred by the actual service of the militia, which
the absence of the regular troops rendered in a great
measure necessary; and the loss of so many hands with∣drawn
from industry, from husbandry, and manufacture.
The loss sustained by this connexion was equally grievous
and apparent; the advantage accruing from it, either to
Britain or Hanover, we have not discernment sufficient
to perceive, consequently cannot be supposed able to
explain.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. The committee of ways and means, having
duely deliberated on the articles of suppply, continued
siting from the twenty-second day of November to the
fourteenth of May, during which period they established
the necessary funds to produce the sums which had been
granted. The land-tax at four shillings in the pound,
and the malt-tax, were continued, as the standing reve∣nue
of Great-Britain. The whole provision made by
the committee of ways and means amounted to sixteen
millions one hundred thirty thousand five hundred and
sixty one pounds, nine shillings, and eight pence, exceed∣ing
the grants for the service of the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty in the sum of six hundred twenty-six
thousand nine hundred ninety-seven pounds, thirteen
shillings, and ten-pence half-penny. This excess, how∣ever,
will not appear extraordinary, when we consider,
that it was destined to make good the premium of two
hundred and forty thousand pounds to the subscribers upon
the eight million loan, as well as the deficiencies in the
other grants, which never fail to make a considerable arti∣cle
in the supply of every session. That these gigantick
strides towards the ruin of publick credit were such as
might alarm every well-wisher to his country will per∣haps
more plainly appear in the sum total of the national
debt, which, including the incumbrance of one million
charged upon the civil list revenue, and provided for by a
tax upon salaries and pensions payable out of that revenue,
amounted, at this period, to the tremendous sum of one
hundred eight millions four hundred ninety-three thou∣sand
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>
one hundred fifty-four pounds, fourteen shillings,
and eleven-pence one farthing. A comfortable reflexion
this to a people involved in the most expensive war that
ever was waged, and already burthened with such taxes
as no other nation ever bore.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. It is not at all necessary to particularise
the acts that were founded upon the resolutions touching
the supply. We shall only observe, that in the act for
the land tax, and in the act for the malt-tax, there was a
clause of credit, empowering the commissioners of the
Treasury to raise the money which they produced by
loans on Exchequer-bills, bearing an interest of four per cent.
per annum, that is, one per cent. higher than the
interest usually granted in time of peace. While the
House of Commons deliberated on the bill for granting
to his Majesty several duties upon malt, and for raising a
certain sum of money to be charged on the said duties, a
petition was presented by the malsters of Ipswich and parts
adjacent against an additional duty on the stock of malt
in hand: but no regard was paid to this remonstrance;
and the bill, with several new amendments, passed through
both Houses, under the title of “An act for granting to
his Majesty several duties upon malt, and for raising the
sum of eight millions by way of annuities and a lottery,
to be charged on the said duties; and to prevent the frau∣dulent
obtaining of allowances in the guaging of corn
making into malt; and for making forth duplicates of
Exchequer-bills, tickets, certificates receipts, annuity-orders,
and other orders lost, burned, or otherwise de∣stroyed.”
The other three bills that turned wholly on
the supply were passed in common course, without the
least opposition in either House, and received the royal
assent by commission, at the end of the session. The first
of these, intituled, “A bill for enabling his Majesty to
raise a certain sum of money for the uses and purposes
therein mentioned,” contained a clause of appropriation,
added to it by instruction; and the Bank was enabled to
lend the million which the commissioners of the Treasury
<PB N="137" REF="142"/>
were empowered-by the act to borrow, at the interest of
four pounds per cent. The second, granting to his
Majesty a certain sum of money out of the sinking fund,
for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and
sixty, comprehended a clause of credit for borrowing the
money thereby granted; and another clause, empowering
the Bank to lend it without any limitation of interest;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the third, enabling his Majesty to raise a certain
sum of money towards discharging the debt of the navy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for naval services during the ensuing year, enacted,
that the Exchequer bills thereby to be issued should not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e received, or pass to any receiver or collector of the
publick revenue, or at the receipt of the Exchequer, be∣fore
the twenty sixth day of March in the year one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-one.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. As the act of the preceding session, pro∣hibiting
the malt-distillery, was to expire at Christmas,
the Commons, thinking it necessary to consider of proper
methods for laying the malt-distillery under such regula∣tions
as might prevent, if possible, its being prejudicial
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the health and morals of the people, began as early as
the month of November to deliberate on this affair;
which being under agitation, petitions were presented to
the House by several of the principal inhabitants of Spital∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elds;
the mayor and commonalty of New Sarum; the
gentlemen, clergy, merchants, manufacturers, tradesmen,
and other inhabitants of Colchester; the mayor, aldermen,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd common-council of King's Lynn in Norfolk; the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayor and bailif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Berwick upon Tweed; representing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e advantages acc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing from the prohibition of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>halt-distillery, and praying the continuance of the act
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which it was prohibited. On the other hand, counter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>titions
were offered by the mayor, magistrates, mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hants,
manufacturers, and other gentlemen of the city
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Norwich; by the land-owners and holders of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uth-west part of Essex; and by the freeholders of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ires of Ross and Cromartie, in North-Britain; alledg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,
that the scarcity of corn, which had made it necessary
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prohibit the malt-distillery, had ceased; and that the
<PB N="138" REF="143"/>
continuing the prohibition beyond the necessity which
had required it would be a great loss and discouragement<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the landed interest; they, therefore, prayed that the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
said distillery might be again opened, under such regula∣tions
and restrictions as the House should think proper▪
These remonstrances being taken into consideration, and
divers accounts perused, the House unanimously agreed
that the prohibition should be continued for a limited
time; and a bill being brought in, pursuant to this reso∣lution,
passed through both Houses, and received th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
royal assent; by which means the prohibition of the malt▪
distillery was continued till the twenty-fourth day of De∣cember
in the year one thousand seven hundred and six∣ty,
unless such continuation should be abridged by any
other act to be passed in the present session.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. The committee, having examined a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
number of accounts and papers relating to spirituous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
quors, agreed to four resolutions, importing, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
present high price of spirituous liquors is a principal ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the diminution in the home consumption thereof, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hath greatly contributed to the health, sobriety, and in∣dustry
of the common people: that, in order to contin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
for the future the present high price of all spirits used <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
home-consumption, a large additional duty should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
laid upon all spirituous liquors whatsoever distilled with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
or imported into Great-Britain, that there should be
drawback of the said additional duties upon all spirituo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
liquors distilled in Great-Britain, which should be ex∣ported;
and that an additional bounty should be grante<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
under proper regulations, upon the exportation of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
spirituous liquors drawn from corn in Great-Britain▪
great many accounts being perused, and witnesses ex∣mined,
relating to the distillery, a bill was brought in,
prevent the excessive use of spirituous liquors, by layi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
an additional duty thereupon; and to encourage the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
portation of British made spirits. Considerable oppositi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was made to the bill, on the opinion that the addition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
duty proposed was too small; and that, among the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lution<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="139" REF="144"/>
there was not so much as one that looked like a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovision or restriction for preventing the pernicious abuse
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f such liquors. Nay, many persons affirmed, that what
was proposed looked more like a scheme for increasing the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublick revenues, than a salutary measure to prevent ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess.
The merchants and manufacturers of the town of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmingham petitioned for such restrictions. The lord∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayor,
aldermen, and common-council of London pre∣sented
a petition by the hands of the two sheriffs, setting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth, that the petitioners had, with great pleasure, ob∣served
the happy consequences produced upon the morals,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehaviour, industry, and health of the lower class of peo∣ple,
since the prohibition of the malt-distillery: that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etitioners, having observed a bill was brought in to allow
the distilling of spirits from corn, were apprehensive that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he encouragement given to the distillers thereof would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rove detrimental to the commercial interests of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation; and they conceived the advantages proposed to be
allowed upon the exportation of such spirits, being so
much above the value of the commodity, would lay such a
temptation for smuggling and perjury as no law could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>revent. They expressed their fears, that, should such a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill pass into a law, the excessive use of spirituous liquors
would not only debilitate and enervate the labourers, ma∣nufacturers,
sailors, soldiers, and all the lower class of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople, and thereby extinguish industry, and that remark∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able
intrepidity which had lately so eminently appeared in
the British nation, which must always depend on the vi∣gour
and industry of its people; but also its liberty and
happiness, which can not be supported without temperance
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd morality, would run the utmost risque of being de∣stroyed.
They declared themselves also apprehensive,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the extraordinary consumption of bread corn by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till would not only raise the price, so as to oppress the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower class of people; but would raise such a bar to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xportation thereof, as to deprive the nation of a great
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lux of money, at that time essential towards the main∣taining
of an expensive war, and therefore highly injure
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he landed and commercial interest: they, therefore, prayed
<PB N="140" REF="145"/>
that the present prohibition of distilling spirits from corn
might be continued, or that the use of wheat might not
be allowed in distillation. This remonstrance was cor∣roborated
by another, to the same purpose, from several
merchants, manufacturers, and traders residing in and
near the city of London; and seemed to have some weight
with the Commons, who made several amendments in the
bill, which they now intituled, “A bill for preventing
the excessive use of spirituous liquors, by laying addi∣tional
duties thereon; for shortening the prohibition for
making low wines and spirits from wheat; for encourage∣ing
the exportation of British made spirits, and preventing
the fraudulent relanding or importation thereof.” Thus
altered and amended, it passed on a division; and, making
its way through the House of Lords, acquired the royal
sanction. Whether the law be adequate to the purposes
for which it was enacted time will determine. The bes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way of preventing the excess of spirituous liquors woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be to lower the excise on beer and ale, so as to enable th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
poorer class of labourers to refresh themselves with a com∣fortable
liquor for nearly the same expense that will pro∣cure
a quantity of Geneva sufficient for intoxication; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it cannot be supposed that a poor wretch will expend h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
last penny upon a draft of small beer, without strength
or the least satisfactory operation, when for the half o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that sum he can purchase a cordial, that will almost in
stantaneously allay the sense of hunger and cold, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gale his imagination with the most agreeable illusions
Malt was at this time sold cheaper than it was in the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
year of Kings James I. when the parliament enacted, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
no inn-keeper, victualler, or alehouse-keeper should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
less than a full quart of the best ale or beer, or two quart
of the small, for one penny, under the penalty of twent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shillings. It appears, then, that in the reign of Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
James the subject paid but four-pence for a gallon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
strong beer, which now costs one shilling; and as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
malt is not increased in value, the difference in the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
must be entirely owing to the taxes on beer, malt, an∣hops,
<PB N="141" REF="146"/>
which are indeed very grievous, though perhaps
necessary. The duty of small beer is certainly one of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaviest taxes imposed upon any sort of consumption that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot be considered as an article of luxury. Two bushels
of malt, and two pounds of hops, are required to make a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrel of good small beer, which was formerly sold for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x shillings; and the taxes payable on such a barrel
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mounted to three shillings and six-pence; so that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um total of the imposition on this commodity was equal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a land tax of eleven shillings and eight pence in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound.</P>
<P>§ L. Immediately after the resolution relating to the
prohibition of spirits from wheat, a motion was made,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd leave given, to bring in a bill to continue, for a time
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mited, the act of the last session, permitting the import∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion
of salted beef from Ireland. This permission was
accordingly extended to the twenty-fourth day of Decem∣ber,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-one.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all probability this short and temporary continuance
was proposed by the favourers of the bill, in order to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>void the clamour and opposition of prejudice and igno∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance,
which would have been dangerously alarmed, had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t been rendered perpetual. Yet, as undoubted evidence
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad proved before the committee, while the bill was de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending,
that the importation had been of great service
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o England, particularly in reducing the price of salted
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eef for the use of the navy, perhaps no consideration
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought to have prevented the legislative from perpetuating
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e law; a measure that would encourage the grasiers of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reland to breed and fatten horned cattle, and certainly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a stop to the practice of exporting salted beef from that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom to France, which undoubtedly furnishes the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raders of that kingdom with opportunities of exporting
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ool to the same country.</P>
<P>§ l. I. As several lieutenants of counties had, for various
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easons, suspended all proceedings in the execution of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ws relating to the militia for limited times, which sus∣pensions
were deemed inconsistent with the intent of the
<PB N="142" REF="147"/>
legislature, a bill was now brought in, to enable his Ma∣jesty's
lieutenants of the several counties of England and
Wales to proceed in the execution of the militia laws,
notwithstanding any adjournments. It was enacted,
that, as the speedy execution of the laws for regulating the
militia was most essentially necessary at this juncture to
the peace and security of the kingdom, every lieutenant
of the place where such suspension had happened should,
within one month after the passing of this act, proceed as▪
if there had been no such suspension; and summon a meet∣ing
for the same purpose once in every succeeding month,
until a sufficient number of officers, qualified and willing
to serve, should be found, or until the expiration of the
act for the better ordering the militia forces. The esta∣blishment
of a regular militia in South-Britain could not
fail to make an impression upon the patriots of Scotland.
They were convinced, from reason and experience, that
nothing could more tend to the peace and security of their
country than such an establishment in North-Britain, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
inhabitants of which had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> peculiarly exposed to in∣surrections,
which a well-regulated militia might have
prevented, or stisled in the birth; and their coast had been
lately alarmed by a threatened invasion, which nothing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but the want of such an establishment had rendered for▪
midable to the natives. They thought themselves en∣titled
to the same security which the legislature had pro∣vided
for their fellow-subjects in South-Britain, and could
not help being uneasy at the prospect of seeing themselve
left unarmed, and exposed to injuries both foreign and do∣mestick,
while the sword was put into the hands of their
southern neighbours. Some of the members who repre∣sented
North-Britain in parliament, moved by these con∣siderations,
as well as by the earnest injunctions of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
constituents, resolved to make a vigorous effort, in order
to obtain the establishment of a regular militia in Scotlan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
In the beginning of March it was moved, and resolved
that the House would, on the twelfth day of the month
resolve itself into a committee, to consider of the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="143" REF="148"/>
being which relate to the militia in that part of Great-Britain
called Scotland. The result of that enquiry was, that
these laws were ineffectual. Then a motion was made
for leave to bring in a bill for the better ordering of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilitia forces in North-Britain, and though it met with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat opposition, was carried by a large majority. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rincipal Scottish members of the House were appointed,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conjunction with others, to prepare the bill, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as soon printed, and re-enforced by petitions presented
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the gentlemen, justices of the peace, and commissioners
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the supply for the shire of Ayr; and by the freeholders
of the shires of Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, and Forfar.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey expressed their approbation of the established militia
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England, and their ardent wish to see the benefit of that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise and salutary measure extended to North-Britain.
This was an indulgence they had the greater reason to hope
or, as by the article of the union they were undoubtedly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntitled to be on the same footing with their brethren of
England, and as the legislature must now be convinced of
the necessity of some such measure, by the consternation
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately produced in their defenceless country, from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hreatened invasion of a handful of French freebooters.
These remonstrances had no weight with the majority in
the House of Commons, who, either unable or unwilling
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o make proper distinctions between the ill and well-af∣fected
subjects of North-Britain, rejected the bill, as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry dangerous experiment in favour of a people among
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom so many rebellions had been generated and pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced.
When the motion was made for the bill's being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted, a warm debate ensued, in the course of which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Scottish members spoke in behalf of their country
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith great force of argument, and a very laudable spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f freedom. Mr. Elliot, in particular, one of the com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issioners
of the board of Admiralty, distinguished him∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf
by a noble flow of eloquence adorned with all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aces of oratory, and warmed with the true spirit of pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iotism.
Mr. Oswald, of the Treasury, acquitted him∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf
with great honour on the occasion; ever nervous,
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
steady, and sagacious, independent though in office, and
invariable in pursuing the true interest of his country. It
must be owned, for the honour of North-Britain, that all
her representatives, except two, warmly contended for this
national measure, which was carried in the negative by a
majority of one hundred and six, though the bill was ex∣actly
modelled by the late act of parliament for the esta∣blishment
of the militia in England.</P>
<P>§ LII. Even this institution, though certainly laudable
and necessary, was attended with so many unforeseen
difficulties, that every session of parliament since it was
first established has produced new acts for its better regu∣lation.
In April, leave was given to prepare a bill for
limiting, confining, and better regulating, the payment of
the weekly allowances made by act of parliament for the
maintenance of families unable to support themselves dur∣ing
the absence of militia-men embodied, and ordered out
into actual service; as well as for amending and improv∣ing
the establishment of the militia, and lessening the num∣ber
of officers entitled to pay within that part of Great-Britain
called England. While this bill was under con∣sideration,
the House received a petition from the mayor,
aldermen, town-clerk, sheriffs, gentlemen, merchants
clergy, tradesmen, and others, inhabitants of the ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
city of Lincoln, representing, That by an act passed re∣lating
to the militia, it was provided, that when any
militia-men should be ordered out into actual service
leaving families unable to support themselves during the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
absence, the overseers of the parish where such familie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>side should allow them such weekly support as should
be prescribed by any one justice of the peace, which allow∣ance
should be re-embursed out of the county stock▪
They alledged, that a considerable number of men, inha∣bitants
of the said city, had entered themselves to serve i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the militia of the county of Lincoln, as volunteers, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several parishes and persons; yet their families were
nevertheless, supported by the county stock of the city an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
county of the city of Lincoln. They took notice of the
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>
bill under deliberation, and prayed, that if it should pass
into a law they might have such relief in the premisses, as

petition in the amendments to the bill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By, this law it was enacted, that if any militia-man who shall have been accepted and enrolled as a substitute, hired man, or volunteer, before the passing of the act, or who shall have been chosen by lot, whether before or after the passing of the act, shall, when embodied, or called out into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> service, and ordered to march, leave a family unable to support themselves, the overseers shall, by order of some one justice of the peace, pay, out of the poor's rates of such parish, a weekly al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ance to such family, according to the usual and ordinary price of labour and husbandry there; viz. for one child under the age of ten years the price of one day's labour; for two chil∣dren under the age aforesaid the price of two days labour; for three or four children under the age aforesaid the price of three days labour; for five or more children under the age aforesaid the price of four days labour; and for the wise of such militia-man the price of one day's labour; but that the families of such m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n only as shall be chosen by lot, and of the substitute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, hired men, and volunteers, already accepted and enrol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, shall, after the passing of this act, receive any such weekly allowance.

through both Houses, and received the royal assent by
commission. During the dependance of this bill, another
was brought in, to explain so much of the militia act passed
in the thirty-first year of his Majesty's reign as related to
the money to be given to private militia men, upon their
being ordered out into actual service. By this law it was
enacted, that the guinea, which by the former act was
due to every private man of every regiment or company of
militia, when ordered out into actual service, should be
paid to every man that shall afterwards be enrolled into
such regiment or company whilst in actual service; that
no man should be entitled to his clothes for his own use
until he should have served three years, if unembodied,
or one year, if embodied, after the delivery of the clothes;
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>
and that the full pay of the militia should commence from
the date of his Majesty's warrant for drawing them out▪
The difficulties which these successive regulations were
made to obviate will be amply recompensed by the good
effects of a national militia, provided it be employed in a
national way, and for national purposes: but if the mi∣litia
are embodied, and the different regiments that com∣pose
it are marched from the respective counties to which
they belong; if the men are detained for any length of
time in actual service, at a distance from their families,
when they might be employed at home in works of in∣dustry,
for the support of their natural dependants, the
militia becomes no other than an addition to, or augmen∣tation
of a standing army, inlisted for the term of three
years. The labour of the men is lost to the community▪
they contract the idle habits and dissolute manners of the
other troops; their families are left as incumbrances on
the community, and the charge of their subsistence is, at
least, as heavy as that of maintaining an equal number
of regular forces. It would not, we apprehend, be very
easy to account for the government's ordering the regiments
of militia to march from their respective counties, and to
do duty for a considerable length of time at a great
distance from their own homes, unless we suppose this
measure was taken to create in the people a disgust to the
institution of the militia, which was an establishment
extorted from the secretary by the voice of the nation.
We may add, that some of the inconveniencies attending a
militia will never be totally removed while the persons
drawn by lot for that service are at liberty to hire substi∣tutes;
for it cannot be supposed that men of substance
will incur the danger, fatigue, and damage of serving in
person, while they can hire among the lowest class of peo∣ple
mercenaries of desperate fortune and abandoned
morals, who will greedily seise the opportunity of being
paid for renouncing that labour by which they were be∣fore
obliged to maintain themselves and their family con∣nexion:
it would, therefore, deserve the consideration of
<PB N="147" REF="152"/>
the legislature, whether the privilege of hiring substitutes
should not be limited to certain classes of men, who are
either raised by their rank in life above the necessity of
serving in person, or engaged in such occupations as cannot
be intermitted without prejudice to the commonwealth.
It must be allowed, that the regulation in this new act, by
which the families of substitutes are deprived of any relief
from the parish, will not only diminish the burthen of the
poor's rates; but also, by raising the price of mercenaries,
oblige a greater number of the better sort to serve in per∣son.
Without all doubt, the fewer substitutes that are
employed, the more dependence may be placed upon the
militia in the preservation of our rights and privileges,
and the more will the number of the disciplined men be
increased, because, at the expiration of every three years,
the lot-men must be changed, and new militia-men
chosen; but the substitutes will, in all probability, con∣tinue
for life in the service, provided they can find lot-men
to hire them at every rotation. The reader will forgive
our being so circumstantial upon the regulations of an in∣stitution
which we cannot help regarding with a kind of
enthusiastick affection.</P>
<P>§ LIII. In the latter end of November the House of
Commons received a petition from several noblemen, gen∣tlemen,
and others, inhabitants of East-Greenwich, and
places adjacent, in Kent, representing, that in the said pa∣rish,
within a quarter of a mile of the town distinguished
by a royal palace, and royal hospital for seamen, there was
a magazine, containing great quantities of gunpowder,
frequently to the amount of six thousand barrels: that,
besides the great danger which must attend all places of
that kind, the said magazine stood in an open field, un∣enclosed
by any fortification or defence whatsoever, con∣sequently
exposed to treachery and every other accident.
They alledged, that if, through treachery, lightning, or
any other accident, this magazine should take fire, not
only their lives and properties, but the palace and hospital,
the King's yards and stores at Deptford and Woolwich,
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>
the banks and navigation of the Thames, with the ships
sailing and at anchor in that river, would be inevitably
destroyed, and inconceivable damage would accrue to the
cities of London and Westminster. They, moreover,
observed that the magazine was then in a dangerous con∣dition,
supported on all sides by props that were decayed at
the foundation; that, in case it should fall, the powder
would, in all probability, take fire, and produce the dread∣ful
calamities above recited: they, therefore, prayed that
the magazine might be removed to some more convenient
place, where any accident would not be attended with
such dismal consequences. The subject of this remon∣strance
was so pressing and important, that a committee
was immediately appointed to take the affair into consi∣deration,
and procure an estimate for purchasing lands,
and erecting a powder-magazine, at Purfleet, in Essex, near
the banks of the river, together with a guard-house, bar∣racks,
and all other necessary conveniencies. While the
report of the committee lay upon the table for the perusal
of the members, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, by his
Majesty's command, acquainted the House, that the King,
having been informed of the subject matter of the petition,
recommended it to the consideration of the Commons.
Leave was immediately given to prepare a bill, founded on
the resolutions of the committee; which, having been
duely considered, altered, and amended, passed through
both houses to the foot of the throne, where it obtained
the royal sanction. The magazine was accordingly re∣moved
to Purfleet, an inconsiderable and solitary village,
where there will be little danger of accident, and where no
great damage would attend an explosion: but, in order to
render this possible explosion still less dangerous, it would
be necessary to form the magazine of small distinct apart∣ments,
totally independent of each other, that, in case one
should be accidentally blown up, the rest might stand un∣affected.
The same plan ought to be adopted in the con∣struction
of all combustible stores subject to conslagration.
The matine bill, and mutiny bill, as annual regulations,
<PB N="149" REF="154"/>
were prepared in the usual form, passed both Houses
without opposition, and received the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ LIV. The next affair that engrossed the deliberation
of the Commons was a measure relating to the internal
oeconomy of the metropolis. The sheriffs of London de∣livered
a petition from the lord-mayor, aldermen, and com∣mons,
in common-council assembled, representing, that
several streets, lanes, and passages within the city of Lon∣don,
and liberties thereof, were too narrow and incom∣modious
for the passing and repassing as well of foot pas∣sengers
as of coaches, carts, and other carriages, to the
prejudice and inconvenience of the owners and inhabitants
of houses, and to the great hinderance of business, trade,
and commerce. They alledged, that these defects might
be remedied, and several new streets opened within the
said city and liberties, to the great ease, safety, and conve∣nience
of passengers, as well as to the advantage of the
publick in general, if they, the petitioners, were enabled
to widen and enlarge the narrow streets, lanes, and pas∣sages,
to open and lay out such new streets and ways, and
to purchase the several houses, buildings, and grounds
which might be necessary for these purposes. They took
notice, that there were several houses within the city and
liberties, partly erected over the ground of other pro∣prietors;
and others, of which the several floors or apart∣ments
belonged to different persons; so that difficulties
and disputes frequently arose amongst the said several
owners and proprietors about pulling down or re-build∣ing
the party-walls and premisses; that such re-building
was often prevented or delayed, to the great injury and
inconvenience of those owners who were desirous to re∣build;
that it would, therefore, be of publick benefit,
and frequently prevent the spreading of the fatal effects of
fire, if some provision were made by law, as well for de∣termining
such disputes in a summary way, as for explain∣ing
and amending the laws then in being relating to the
building of party-walls. They, therefore, prayed that
leave might be given to bring in a bill for enabling the
<PB N="150" REF="155"/>
petitioners to widen and enlarge the several streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> lanes,
and passages, and to open new streets and ways to be there
in limited and described; as well as for determining, in
a summary way, all disputes arising about the re-building
of houses or tenements within the said city and liberties,
wherein several persons have an intermixed property; and
for explaining and amending the laws in being relating to
these particulars. A committee being appointed to ex∣amine
the matter of this petition, agreed to a report, upon
which leave was given to prepare a bill, and this was
brought in accordingly. Next day a great number of
citizens represented, in another petition, that the pavement
of the city and liberties was often damaged, by being
broken up for the purposes of amending or new-laying
water-pipes belonging to the proprietors of water-works;
and praying that provision might be made in the bill then
depending to compel those proprietors to make good any
damage that should be done to the pavement by the leaking
or bursting of the water-pipes, or opening the pavement
for alterations. In consequence of this representation,
some amendments were made in the bill, which passed
through both Houses, and was enacted into a law, under
the title startq;An act for widening certain streets, lanes,
and passages, within the city of London and liberties
thereof; and for opening certain new streets and ways
within the same, and for other purposes therein men∣tioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The openings to be made, and the passages to be improved and enlarged were ascertained by two schedules, annexed to the act. With respect to the houses, buildings, and grounds to be purchased, the mayor, aldermen, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commons of the city, in common-council assembled, or a committee appoint∣ed by them, were empowered to fix the price by agreement with the respectiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proprietors, or otherwise by a jury, in the usual manner. With regard: party-walls, the act ordains, that the proprietor of either adjoining <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the proprietor of the other to agree to its being pussed down <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rebuilt, and to pay a moi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of the expense, even though it should not necessary to pull down or rebuild either of their houses: that all party-wall shall be at least two bricks and a half in thickness in the cellar, and two back thick upwards, to the top of the garret-floor. It enacts, that if any deca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> house belongs to several proprietors, any one of them, who is desirous to rebu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may oblige the others to concur, and join with him in the expense, or purchase their shares at a price to be fixed by a jury. If any house should hereafter be presented by any inquest, or grand jury, in London, as being in a ruinous condition, the court of mayor and aldermen is, by this act, em∣powered to pull it down at the expense of the ground-landlord. As to da∣maged pavements, not sufficiently repaired by the proprietors of the water∣works, any justice of the peace in London is vested with power, upon their refusing or delaying to make it good, to cause it to be effectually relayed with good materials at their expense.</NOTE>”</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="156"/>
§ LV. The inhabitants of Westminster had long la∣boured
under the want of a fish-market,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> and complained
that the price of this species of provision was kept up at
an exorbitant rate by the fraudulent combination of a few
dealers, who engrossed the whole market at Billinsgate,
and destroyed great quantities of fish, in order to enhance
the value of those that remained. An act of parliament
had passed in the twenty-second year of his present Ma∣jesty's
reign, for establishing a free market for the sale of
fish in Westminster; and, seven years after that period,
it was found necessary to procure a second, for explaining
and amending the first: but neither effectually answered
the purposes to the legislature. In the month of January
of the present session the House took into consideration a
petition of the several fishermen trading to Billingsgate-market,
representing the hardships to which they were ex∣posed
by the said acts; particularly forfeitures of vessels
and cargoes, incurred by the negligence of servants, who
had omitted to make the particular entries which the two
acts prescribed. This petition being examined by a com∣mittee,
and the report being made, leave was given to
bring in a new bill, which should contain effectual pro∣vision
for the better supplying the cities of London and
Westminster with fish, and for preventing the abuses of
the fishmongers. It was entitled, “A bill to repeal so
much of an act passed in the twenty-ninth of George II.
concerning a free market for fish at Westminster as re∣quires
fishermen to enter their fishing-vessels at the office
of the searcher of the Customs at Gravesend, and to regulate
the sale of fish at the first hand in the fish-markets in Lon∣don
and Westminster; and to prevent salesmen of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>
buying fish to sell again on their own account; and to
allow bret and turbot, brill and pearl, although under the
respective dimensions mentioned in a former act, to be im∣ported
and sold; and to punish persons who shall take or
sell any spawn, brood, or fish of fry, unsizeable fish, or
fish out of season, or smelts under the size of five inches,
and for other purposes.” Though this and the former
bill, relating to the streets and houses of London, are
instances that evince the care and attention of the legis∣lature,
even to minute particulars of the internal oeconomy
of the kingdom, we can hardly consider them as objects
of such dig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity and importance as to demand the delibera∣tions
of the parliament, but think they naturally fall with∣in
the cognizance of the municipal magistracy. After all,
perhaps the most effectual method for supplying West∣minster
with plenty of fish, at reasonable rates, would be
to execute with rigour the laws already enacted against
forestalling and regrating; an expedient that would soon
dissolve all monopolies and combinations among the
traders; to increase the number of markets in London
and Westminster; and to establish two general markets at
the Nore, one on each side of the river, where the fishing-vessels
might unload their cargoes, and return to sea with∣out
delay. A number of light boats might be employed
to convey fresh fish from these marts to London and West∣minster,
where all the different fish-markets might be
plentifully supplied at a reasonable expense; for it cannot
be supposed, that while the fresh ish are brought up the
river in the fishing-smacks themselves, which can hardly
save their tides to Billingsgate, they will ever dream of
carrying their cargoes above bridge; or that the price of
fish can be considerably lowered, while the fishing-vessels
lose so much time in running up to Gravesend or Bil∣lingsgate.</P>
<P>§ LVI. The annual committee being appointed to en∣quire
what laws were expired, or near expiring, agreed to
certain resolutions; upon which a bill was prepared, and
obtained the royal assent, importing a continuation of
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>
several laws, namely, the several clauses mentioned of the
acts in the fifth and eighth of George I. against the clan∣destine
running of uncustomed goods, except the clauses
relating to quarentine; the act passed in the third of
George II. relating to the carrying rice from Carolina;
the act in the seventh of the same reign, relating to co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chineal
and indigo; and that of the twelfth of George II.
so far as it related to the importation of printed books.
There was also a law enacted, to continue to the twenty-ninth
day of September, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-seven, an act passed in the twelfth year
of Queen Anne, for encouraging the making of sail-cloth,
by a duty of one penny per <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll laid upon all foreign made
sails and sail-cloth imported, and a bounty in the same
proportion granted upon all home-made sail-cloth and
canvas fit for, or made into sails, and exported; another
act was passed, for continuing certain laws relating to the
additional number of one hundred hackney coaches and
chairs, which law was rendered perpetual. The next law
we shall mention was intended to be one of the most im∣portant
that ever fell under the cognizance of the legi∣slature:
it was a law that affected the freedom, dignity,
and independency of parliament. By an act passed in the
ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne it was provided
that no person should be chosen a member of parliament
who did not possess in England or Wales an estate, free∣hold
or copyhold, for life, according to the following
qualifications: for every knight of a shire six hundred
pounds per annum, over and above what will satisfy all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncumbrances; and three hundred pounds per annum
for every citizen, burgess, and baron of the cinque-ports.
It was also decreed, that the return of any person not thus
qualified should be void; and that every candidate should,
at the reasonable request of any other candidate at the time
of election, or by two or more persons who had a right to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote, take an oath prescribed to establish his qualifications.
This restraint was by no means effectual. So many o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths
of different kinds had been prescribed since the Revolution,
<PB N="154" REF="159"/>
that they began to lose the effect they were intended to
have on the minds of men; and, in particular, political
pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jury grew so common, that it was no longer considered
as a crime. Subterfuges were discovered, by means of
which this law relating to the qualification of candidates
was effectually eluded. Those who were not actually
possessed of such estates procured temporary conveyances
from their friends and patrons, on condition of their being
restored and cancelled after the election. By this scan∣dalous
fraud, the intention of the legislature was frustrated,
the dignity of parliament prostituted, the example of per∣jury
and corruption extended, and the vengeance of heaven
set at defiance. Through this infamous channel the mi∣nistry
had it in their power to thrust into parliament a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of venal beggars, who, as they depended upon their boun∣ty,
would always be obsequious to their will, and vo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
according to direction, without the least regard to the
dictates of their conscience, or to the advantage of their
country. The mischiefs attending such a vile collusion
and in particular the undue influence which the crow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
must have acquired from the practice, were either felt o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
apprehended by some honest patriots, who after divers u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
successful efforts, at length presented to the House a bill
importing that every person who shall be elected a member
of the House of Commons should, before he presumed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
take his seat, deliver to the clerk of the House, at the tabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
while the Commons are sitting, and the Speaker in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
chair, a paper or schedule signed by himself, containing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
rental or particular of the lands, tenements, or heredit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ments whereby he makes out his qualification, specifyi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the nature of his estate, whether messuage, land ren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

suages, lands, or tithes, then specifying in whose occu∣pation
they are; and if in rent, then specifying the nam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the owners or possessors of the lands and tenements o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of which such rent is issuing, and also specifying the pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
township, or precinct and county, in which the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
estate lies, and the value thereof; and every such pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>
shall, at the same time, also take and subscribe the follow∣ing
oath, to be fairly written at the bottom of the paper or
schedule: “I A. B. do swear that the above is a true
rental: and that I truely, and <HI>bonâ side,</HI> have such an
estate in law or equity, to and for my own use and bene∣fit,
of and in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments
above described, over and above what will satisfy and
clear all incumbrances that may affect the same; and
that such estate hath not been granted or made over to
me fraudulently, on purpose to qualify me to be a mem∣ber
of this House. So help me God!” It was provided
that the said paper or schedule, with the oath aforesaid,
should be carefully kept by the clerk, to be inspected by
the members of the House of Commons, without fee or
reward: that if any person elected to serve in any future
parliament should presume to sit or vote as a member of
the House of Commons before he had delivered in such a
paper or schedule, and taken the oath aforesaid, or should
not be qualified according to the true intent or meaning of
this act, his election should be void; and every person so
sitting and voting should forfeit a certain sum, to be re∣covered
by such person as should sue for the same by action
of debt, bill, plaint, or information, whereon no essoign,
privilege, protection, or wager of law should be allowed,
and only one imparlanch: that if any person should have
delivered in, and sworn to, his qualification as aforesaid,
and taken his seat in the House of Commons, yet at any
time after should, during the continuance of such par∣liament,
sell, dispose of, alien, or any otherwise incumber
the estate, or any part there of comprised in the schedule,
so as to lessen or reduce the same under the value of the
qualification by law directed; every such person, under a
certain penalty, must deliver in a new, or further qua∣lification,
according to the true intent and meaning of
this act, and swear to the same, in manner before directed,
before he shall again presume to sit or vote as a member of
the House of Commons; that in case any action, suit, or
information should be brought, in pursuance of this act,
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
against any member of the House of Commons, the clerk
of the House shall, upon demand, forthwith deliver a true
and attested copy of the paper or schedule so delivered in to
him as aforesaid by such member to the plaintiff or prose∣cutor,
or his attorney or agent, paying a certain sum for
the same; which being proved a true copy, shall be ad∣mitted
to be given in evidence upon the trial of any issue
in any such action. Provided always, that nothing con∣tained
in this act shall extend to the eldest son or heir ap∣parent
of any peer or lord of parliament, or of any person
qualified to serve as knight of the shire, or to the members
for either of the universities in that part of Great Britain
called England, or to the members for that part of Great-Britain
called Scotland. Such was the substance of the
bill, as originally presented to the House of Commons;
but it was altered in such a manner, as, we are afraid,
will fail in answering the salutary purposes for which it
was intended by those who brought it into the House.
Notwithstanding the provisions made in the act as it now
stands, any minister or patron may still introduce his pen∣sioners,
clerks, and creatures into the House, by means of
the old method of temporary conveyance, though the farce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
must now be kept up until the member shall have delivered
in his schedule, taken his oath, and his seat in parliament;
then he may deliver up the conveyance, or execute a re∣conveyance,
without running any risk of losing his seat,
or of being punished for his fraud and perjury. The ex∣tensive
influence of the crown, the general corruptibility of
individuals, and the obstacles so industriously thrown in
the way of every scheme contrived to vindicate the inde∣pendency
of parliaments, must have produced very mor∣tifying
reflexions in the breast of every Briton w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med
with the genuine love of his country. He must ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per∣ceived
that all the bulwarks of the constitution were little
better than buttresses of ice, which would infallibly thaw
before the heat of ministerial influence, when artfully con∣centrated;
that either a minister's professions of patriotism
were insincere, or his credit insufficient to effect any

essential alteration in the unpopular measures of govern∣ment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE>
and that, after all, the liberties of the nation could
never be so firmly established, as by the power, generosity,
and virtue of a patriot King. This inference could not
fail to awake the remembrance of that amiable prince,
whom fate untimely snatched from the eager hopes and
warm affection of a whole nation, before he had it in his
power to manifest and establish his favourite maxim,

D. to give the most positive assurances to the gentlemen in the opposition of his upright <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entions; that he is thoroughly convinced of the distresses and calamities that have befallen, and every day are more likely to befall, this country; and therefore invites all well-wishers to this country and its constitution to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alesce and unite with him, and upon the following principle only; His Royal Highness promises, and will declare it openly, that it is his intention totally to abolish any distinctions for the future of parties; and as far as lies in his power, and as soon as it does lie in his power, to take away for ever all proscription from any set of men whatever who are friends to the constitution: and, therefore, will promote for the present and when it is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his power, will immediately grant, First, A bill to empower all gentlemen to act as justices of peace paying land-tax for 300 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> in any county where he intends to serve.

Thirdly, His Royal Highness promises, in like manner, to promote and support, and likewise grant, when it is in his power, a bill to exclude all military officers in the land-service, under the degree of colonels of regi∣ments, and in the sea-service, under the degree of tear-admirals, from sitting in the House of Commons. Fourthly, His Royal Highness promises that he will, when in his power, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rant enquiries into the great number of abuses in offices, and does not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oubt of the assistance of all honest men, to enable him to correct the same or the future.

§ LVII. On the first day of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> a motion was
made, and leave given, to bring in a bill for enabling his
Majesty to make leases and copies of offices, lands, and
hereditaments, parcel of his duchy of Cornwall, or an∣nexed
to the same; accordingly, it passed through both
Houses without opposition, and enacted, that all leases and
grants made, or to be made, by his Majesty, within seven
years next ensuing, in, or annexed to, the said duchy,
under the limitations therein mentioned, should be good
and effectual in law against his Majesty, his heirs, and
successors, and against all other persons that should here∣after
inherit the said duchy, either by act of parliament,
or any limitation whatsoever. This act appears the more
extraordinary, as the Prince of Wales, who has a sort of
right by prescription to the duchy of Cornwall, was then
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
of age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1760.</NOTE> and might have been put in possession of it by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assing of a patent. The House having perused an ac∣count
of the produce of the fund established for paying
annuities granted in the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-nine, with the charge on that fund on the fifth
day of January, in the succeeding year, it appeared that
there had been a considerable deficiency in the said fund on
the fifth day of July preceding, and this had been made
good out of the sinking fund, by a resolution of the seventh
of February, already particularised. They, therefore,
instructed the committee of ways and means to consider
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much of the annuity and lottery act passed in the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding
session as related to the three per centum annuities,
amounting to the sum of seven millions five hundred and
ninety thousand pounds, granted in the year one thousand
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even hundred and fifty-nine; and also to consider so
much of the said act as related to the subsidy of poundage
upon certain goods and merchandises to be imported into
this kingdom, and the additional inland duty on coffee and
chocolate. The committee having taken these points into
deliberation, agreed to the two resolutions we have already
mentioned with respect to the consolidation, and a bill
was brought in for adding those annuities granted in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>int stock of three per centum annuities consolidated by
the acts of the twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth,
and thirty-second years of his Majesty's reign; and for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everal duties therein mentioned, to the sinking-fund.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he committee was afterwards empowered to receive a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause for cancelling such lottery tickets as were made
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth in pursuance of an act passed in the thirtieth year
of his Majesty's reign, and were not then disposed of: a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause for this purpose was accordingly added to the bill,
which passed through both Houses without opposition,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd received the royal assent at the end of the session.</P>
<P>§ LVIII. On the twenty-ninth day of April, Lord
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth presented to the House a bill for encouraging the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xportation of rum and spirits of the growth, produce,
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
and manufacture of the British sugar plantations from
Great-Britain, and of British spirits made from melasses;
a bill which in a little time acquired the sanction of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
royal assent. Towards the end of April, Admiral Town<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shend presented a bill for the more effectual securing the
payment of such prize and bounty monies as were appro∣priated
to the use of Greenwich-hospital by an act passe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the twenty-ninth year of his Majesty's reign. As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that law no time was limited, or particular method pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣scribed
for giving notifications of the day appointed fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the payment of the shares of the prizes and bounty money<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and many agents had neglected to specify in the notificatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
given in the London Gazettee for payment, of shares <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
prizes condemned in the courts of Admiralty in Great
Britain the particular day or time when such payment
were to commence, whereby it was rendered difficult
if not impossible, to ascertain the time when the hospit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
at Greenwich became intituled to the unclaimed share,
of consequence could not enjoy the full benefit of the act
the bill now prepared imported, that from and after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

of the payment of the shares of prizes taken b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
any of his Majesty's ships of war, and condemned in
Great-Britain, and from and after the first day of Febru∣ary,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty
one, all notifications of the payment of the shares an
prizes taken and condemned in any other of his Majesty
dominions in Europe, or in any of the British plantation

December, in the year one thousand seven hundred an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sixty-one, all notifications of the payment of the share
of prizes taken and condemned in any other of his Ma∣jesty's
dominions, shall be respectively given and pub∣lished
in the following manner: if the prize be condem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in any court of Admiralty in Great-Britain, such noti∣fication,
under the agent's hand, shall be published in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
London Gazette; and if condemned in any court o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
admiralty in any other of his Majesty's dominions,▪ su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
notification shall be published in like manner in the Ga∣zette,
or other news-paper of publick authority, of the
island or place where the prize is condemned; and if
there shall be no Gazette, or such news-paper, published
there, then in some or one of the publick news-papers of
the place; and such agents shall deliver to the collector,
costomer, or searcher, or his lawful deputy, and if there
shall be no such officer, then to the principal officer or
officers of the place where the prize is condemned, or
to the lawful deputy of such principal officer, two of the
Gazettes or other news-papers in which such notifications
are inserted; and if there shall not be any publick news∣papers
in any such island of place, the agent shall give
two such notifications in writing, under his hand; and
every such collector, or other officer as aforesaid, shall
subscribe his name on both the said Gazettes, news∣papers,
or written notifications, and, by the first ship
which shall sail from thence to any port of Great-Britain,
shall transmit to the treasurer or deputy treasurers of the
said royal hospital one of the said notifications, with his
name so subscribed, to be there registered, and shall faith∣fully
preserve and keep the other, with his name thereon
subscribed, in his own custody; and in every notification
as aforesaid the agent shall specify his place of abode, and
the precise day of the month and year appointed for the
payment of the respective shares to the captors; and all
notifications with respect to prizes condemned in Great-Britain
shall be published in the London Gazette three
days at least before any share of such prize shall be paid;
and with respect to prizes condemned in any other part of
his Majesty's dominions, such notifications shall be de∣livered
to the said collector, or other officers as aforesaid,
three days at least before any share of such prizes shall be
paid. It was likewise enacted, that the agents for the
distribution of bounty-bills should insert, and publish
under their hands, in the London Gazette, three days at
least before payment, publick notifications of the day and
year appointed for such payment, and also insert therein
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
their respective places of abode. The bill, even as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
now stands, is liable to several objections. It may be
dangerous to leave the money of the unclaimed shares so
long as three years in the hands of the agent, who, toge∣ther
with his securities, may prove insolvent before the
expiration of that term: then the time prescribed to the
sailors within which their claim is limited appears to be
too short, when we consider that they may be so circum∣stanced,
turned over to another ship, and conveyed to a
distant part of the globe, that they shall have no oppor∣tunity
to claim payment; and should three years elapse
before they could make application to the agent, they
would find their bounty or prize money appropriated to
the use of Greenwich-Hospital; nay, should they die in
the course of the voyage, it would be lost to their heirs
and executors, who, being ignorant of their title, could
not possibly claim within the time limited.</P>
<P>§ LIX. A committee having been appointed to enquire
into the original standards of weights and measures in
the kingdom of England, to consider the laws relating
thereto, and to report their observations thereupon, to∣gether
with their opinion of the most effectual means for
ascertaining and enforcing uniform and certain standards
of weights and measures, they prepared copies, models,
patterns, and multiples, and presented them to the House▪
then they were locked up by the clerk of the House; and
Lord Carysfort presented a bill, according to order,
for enforcing uniformity of weights and measures to the
standards by law to be established: but this measure,
which had been so long in dependence, was not yet fully
discussed, and the standards and weights were reserved to
another occasion. A law was made for reviving and
continuing so much of an act passed in the twenty-first
year of his Majesty's reign as relates to the more effectual
trial and punishment of high-treason in the highlands of
Scotland; and also for continuing two other acts passed
in the nineteenth and twenty-first years of his Majesty's
reign, so far as they relate to the more effectual disarming
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>
the highlands of Scotland, and securing the peace
thereof; and to allow further time for making affidavits
of the execution of articles or contracts of clerks to attor∣nies
or sollicitors, and filing thereof. The King having
been pleased to pardon George Keith, Earl Marischal of
Scotland, who had been attainted for rebellion in the
year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, the parlia∣ment
confirmed this indulgence, by passing an act to en∣able
the said George Keith, late Earl Marischal, to sue
or entertain any action of suit, notwithstanding his at∣tainder,
and to remove any disability in him, by reason
of the said attainder, to take or inherit any real or personal
estate that may and shall hereafter descend or come to
him, or which he was entitled to in reversion or remainder
before his attainder. This nobleman, universally re∣spected
for his probity and understanding, had been em∣ployed
as ambassador to the court of France by the King
of Prussia, and was actually at this juncture in the service
of that monarch, who, in all probability, interceded
with the King of England in his behalf. When his
pardon had passed the seals, he repaired to London, and
was presented to his Majesty, by whom he was very gra∣ciously
received.</P>
<P>§ LX. These and a good number of other bills of less
importance, both private and publick, were passed into
laws by commission, on the twenty-second day of May,
when the lord-keeper of the great seal closed the session
with a speech to both Houses. He began with an assur∣ance
that his Majesty looked back on their proceedings
with entire satisfaction. He said, the duty and affection
which they had expressed for the King's person and go∣vernment,
the zeal and unanimity they had showed in
maintaining the true interest of their country, could only
be equalled by what his Majesty had formerly experienced
from this parliament. He told them it would have given
his Majesty the most sensible pleasure, had he been able
to assure them that his endeavours to promote <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n general
peace had met with more suitable returns. He observed,
<PB N="164" REF="169"/>
that his Majesty, in conjunction with his good brother and
ally the King of Prussia, had chosen to give their enemies
proofs of this equitable disposition, in the midst of the series
of glorious victories; an opportunity the most proper to
take such a step with dignity, and to manifest to all Eu∣rope
the purity and moderation of his views. After such
a conduct, he said, the King had the comfort to reflect
that the further continuance of the calamities of war
could not be imputed to him or his allies; that he trusted
in the blessings of heaven upon the justice of his arms, and
upon those ample means which the zeal of the parliament
in so good a cause had wisely put into his hands, that his
future successes in carrying on the war would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all
short of the past; and that, in the event, the publick
tranquillity would be restored on solid and durable foun∣dations.
He acquainted them that his Majesty had taken
the most effectual care to augment the combined army in
Germany: and at the same time to keep up such a force
at home as might frustrate any attempts of the enemy
to invade these kingdoms; such attemps as had hitherto
ended only in their own confusion. He took notice that
the royal navy was never in a more flourishing and respect∣able
condition; and the signal victory obtained last winter
over the French fleet on their own coasts had given lustre
to his Majesty's arms, fresh spirits to his maritime forces,
and reduced the naval strength of France to a very low
ebb. He gave them to understand that his Majesty had
disposed his squ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in such a manner as might best con∣duce
to the annoyance of his enemies; to the defence of
his own dominions, both in Europe and America; to
the preserving and pursuing his conquests, as well as to
the protection of the trade of his subjects, which he had
extremely at heart. He told the Commons, that nothing
could relieve his Majesty's royal mind, under the anxiety
he felt for the burthens of his faithful subjects, but the
publick-spirited chearfulness with which their House had
granted him such large supplies, and his conviction that
they were necessary for the security had essential interests
<PB N="165" REF="170"/>
of his kingdom; he, therefore, returned them his hearty
thanks for these supplies, and assured them they should
be duely applied to the purposes for which they had been
given. Finally, he recommended to both Houses the
continuance of that union and good harmony which he
had observed with so much pleasure, and from which he
had derived such important effects. He desired they
would study to promote these desireable objects, to sup∣port
the King's government, and the good order of their
respective counties, and consult their own real happiness
and prosperity.</P>

<P>§ I. THE successes of the last campaign had slushed<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII. 1760.</NOTE>
the whole nation with the most elevated hope
of future conquest, and the government was enabled to
take every step which appeared necessary to realise that
sanguine expectation: but the war became every day more
and more Germanised. Not withstanding the immense
sums that were raised for the expense of the current year;
notwithstanding the great number of land forces main∣tained
in the service, and the numerours fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed the
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
harbours of Great-Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> we do not find that one fresh
effort was made to improve the advantages she had gained
upon her own element; or for pushing the war on na∣tional
principles: for the reduction of Canada was no more
than the consequence of the measures which had been
taken in the preceding campaign. But, before we record
the progress of the war, it may be necessary to specify
some domestick occurrences, that for a little while engros∣sed
the publick attention. In the month of December, in
the preceding year, William Andrew Horne, a gentle∣man
of some fortune in Derbyshire, was executed at
Nottingham, in the seventy-fourth year of his age, for
the murther of an insant born of his own sister, in the
year one thousand seven hundred and twenty-four. On
the third day after the birth, this brutal ruffian thrust the
child into a linen bag, and, accompanied by his own
brother on horseback, conveyed it to Anne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley, in Not∣tinghamshire,
where it was next day found dead under a
hay-stack. Though this cruel rustick knew how much
he lay at the mercy of his brother, whom he had made
privy to this affair, far from endeavouring to engage his
secresy by offices of kindness and marks of affection, he
treated him as an alien to his blood; not barely with in∣difference,
but even with the most barbarous rigour. He
not only defrauded him of his right, but exacted of him
the lowest menial services; beheld him starving in a cot∣tage,
while he lived himself in affluence; and refused to
relieve with a morsel of charity the children of his own
brother begging at his gate. It was the resentment of
this pride and bar barity which, in all likelihood, first
impelled the other to revenge. He pretended qualms of
conscience, and disclosed the transaction of the child to
several individuals. As the brother was universally hated
for the insolence and brutality of his disposition, inform∣ation
was given against him, and a resolution formed to
bring him to condign punishment. Being informed of
this design, he tampered with his brother, and desired
that he would retract, upon the trial, the evidence he
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad given before the justice. Though the brother re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected
this scheme of subordination, he offered to with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raw
himself from the kingdom, if he might have five
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds to defray the expense of his removal. So sordidly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varitious was the other, that he refused to advance this<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
miserable pittance, though he knew his own life depended
upon his compliance. He was accordingly apprehended,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried, and convicted on his brother's evidence; and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he confessed the particulars of his exposing the infant.
He denied, indeed, that he had any thought the child
would perish, and declared he intended it as a present
to the gentleman at whose gate it was laid: but as he
appeared to be hardened miscreant, devoid of humanity,
stained with the complicated crimes of tyranny, fraud,
rapine, incest, and mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, very little credit is due to
his declaration. In the course of the same month, part
of Westminster was grievo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly alarmed by a dreadful con∣flagration,
which broke out<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the house of a cabinet∣maker
near Covent-Garden, raged with great fury, and
reduced near twenty houses to ashes. Many others
were damaged, and several presons either burned in their
apartments, or buried under the ruins. The bad con∣quences
of this calamity were in a great measure alleviated
by the humanity of the publick, and the generous com∣passion
of the Prince of Wales, who contributed liberally
to the relief of the sufferers.</P>
<P>§ II. But no subject so much engrossed the conversation
and passions of the publick as did the case of Lord George
Sackville, who had by this time resigned his command
in Germany, and returned to England, the country
which, of all others, it would have been his interest to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>void at this juncture, if he was really conscions of the
guilt, the imputation of which his character now sustained.
With the first tidings of the battle sought at Minden
the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amation of this officer arrived. He was accused of
having disobeyed orders, and his conduct represented as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfamous in every particular. These were the suggestions
of a vague report, which no person could trace to its
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
origin; yet this report immediately gave birth to one of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the most inflammatory pamphlets that ever was exhibited
to the publick. The first charge had alarmed the people<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of England, jealous in honour, sudden and rash in their<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
resentments, and obstinately adhering to the prejudices,
they have espoused. The implied accusation in the orders,
of Prince Ferdinand, and the combustible matter super-added
by the pamphlet-writer, kindled up such a blaze
of indignation in the minds of the people, as admitted of
no temperament or controul. An abhorrence and de∣testation
of Lord George Sackville, as a coward and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
traitor, became the universal passion, which acted by con∣tagion,
infecting all degrees of people from the cottage to,
the throne; and no individual, who had the least regard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for his own character and quiet, would venture to preac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
up moderation, or even advise a suspension of belief unti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
more certain information could be received. Fresh fue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was continually thrown in by obscure authors of pam∣phlets
and news-papers, who stigmatised and insulted with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
such virulent perseverance, that one would have imagine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they were actuated by personal motives, not retained b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mercenary booksellers, against that unfortunate nobleman<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Not satisfied with inventing circumstances to his disho∣nour,
in his conduct on the last occasion, they pretende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to take a retrospective view of his character, and produce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a number of anecdotes to his prejudice, which had never<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
before seen the light, and but for this occasion had pro∣bably
never been known. Not that all the writings which<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
appeared on this subject contained fresh matter of aggra∣vation
against Lord George Sackville. Some writers
either animated by the hope of advantage, or hired t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tray the cause which they undertook to defend, entered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the list as professed champions of the accused, assume<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the pen in his behalf, devoid of sense, unfurnished wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
materials, and produced performances which could no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to injure his character among all those who believe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that he countenanced their endeavours, and supplied the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the facts and arguments of his defence. Such pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely was the state of the dispute when Lord George
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rived in London. While Prince Ferdinand was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owned with laurel: while the King of Great-Britain
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pproved his conduct, and as the most glorious mark of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at approbation, invested him with the order of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arter; while his name was celebrated through all Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd,
and extolled, in the warmest expressions of hyper∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,
above all the heroes of antiquity; every mouth
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as opened in execration of the late commander of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritish troops in Germany. He was now made acquaint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
with the particulars of his imputed guilt, which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad before indistinctly learned. He was accused of having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isobeyed three successive orders he had received from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eneral, during the action at Minden, to advance with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e cavalry of the right wing, which he commanded,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd sustain the infantry that were engaged; and after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he cavalry were put in motion, of having halted them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnecessarily, and marched so slow, that they could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each the place of action in time to be of any service;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which conduct the opportunity was lost of attacking
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he enemy when they gave way, and rendering the victory
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore glorious and decisive. The first step which Lord
George took towards his own vindication with the publick,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as in printing a short address, entreating them to suspend
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir belief with respect to his character until the charge
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought against him should be legally discussed by a court∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artial;
a trial which he had already sollicited, and was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n hopes of obtaining.</P>
<P>§ III. Finding himself unable to stem the tide of popu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar
prejudice, which flowed against him with irresistible
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uosity, he might have retired in quiet and safety,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd left it to ebb at leisure. This would have been ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erally
deemed a prudential step, by all those who con∣sidered
the unfavourable medium through which every
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articular of his conduct must have been viewed at that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncture, even by men who cherished the most candid
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntentions; when they reflected upon the power, influ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce,
and popularity of his accuser; the danger of aggra∣vating
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
the resentment of the sovereign, already too con∣spicuous,
and the risk of hazarding his life on the honour
and integrity of witnesses, who might think their fortunes
depended upon the nature of the evidence they should give.
Notwithstanding those suggestions Lord George, seeming∣ly
impatient of the imputation under which his character
laboured, insisted upon the privilege of a legal trial, which
was granted accordingly, after the judges had given it as
their opinion that he might be tried by a court-martial,
though he no longer retained any commission in the ser∣vice.
A court of general officers being appointed and
assembled to enquire into his conduct, the judge-advocate
gave them to understand that he was charged with having
disobeyed the orders of Prince Ferdinand, relative to the
battle of Minden. That the reader may have the more
distinct idea of the charge, it is necessary to remind him
that Lord George Sackville commanded the cavalry of
the right wing, confisting of Hanoverian and British horse,
disposed in two lines, the British being at the extremity of
the right, extending to the village of Hartum; the Hano∣verian
cavalry forming the left, that reached almost to an
open wood or grove, which divided the horse from the
line of infantry, particularly from that part of the line of
infantry consisting of two brigades of British foot, the
Hanov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian guards, and Hardenberg's regiment. This
was the body of troops which sustained the brunt of the
battle with the most incredible courage and perseverance.
They of their own accord advanced to attack the left of
the enemy's cavalry, through a most dreadful fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of ar∣tillery
and small arms, to which they were exposed in front
and flank; they withstood the repeated attacks of the
whole French gendarmerie, whom, at length, they totally
routed, together with a body of Saxon troops on their
left, and to their valour the victory was chiefly owing.
The ground from which these troops advanced was a kind
of heath or plain, which opened a considerable way to the
left, where the rest of the army was formed in order of
battle; but on the right it was bounded by the wood,
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
on the other side of which the cavalry of the right wing
was posted, having in front the village of Halen, from
whence the French had been driven by the piquets in the
army there posted, and in front of them a windmill, situ∣ated
in the middle space between them and a battery
placed on the left of the enemy.</P>
<P>§IV. Early in the morning Captain Malhorti had, by order
of Prince Ferdinand, posted the cavalry of the right wing
in the situation we have jus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> described, the village of Har∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um
with enclosures on the right, a narrow wood on the
left, the village of Halen in their front, and a windmill in
the middle of an open plain, which led directly to the
enemy. In this position Lord George Sackville was di∣rected
to remain, until he should receive further orders;
and here it was those orders were given which he was said
to have disobeyed. Indeed, he was previously charged
with having neglected the orders of the preceding even∣ing,
which imported that the horses should be saddled
at one in the morning, though the tents were not to be
struck, nor the troops under arms, until they should receive
further orders. He was accused of having disobeyed these
orders, and of having come late into the field, after the
cavalry was formed. Captain Winchingrode, aide-du-camp
to Prince Ferdinand, declared upon oath, that while
the infantry of the right wing were advancing towards
the enemy for the second time, he was sent with orders to
Lord George Sackville to advance with the cavalry of the
right wing, and sustain the infantry, which was going to
engage, by forming the horse under his command, upon
the heath, in a third line behind the regiments; that he
delivered these orders to Lord George Sackville, giving
him to understand that he should march the cavalry
through the wood or trees on his left to the heath where
they were to be formed; that, on his return to the heath,
he met Colonel Fitzroy riding at full gallop towards Lord
George; and that he (Winchingrode) followed him back,
in order to hasten the march of the cavalry. Colonel
Ligonier, another of the Prince's aides-du-camps, deposed
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>
that he carried orders from the general to Lord George <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
advance with the cavalry, in order to profit from the dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣order
which appeared in the enemy's cavalry; that Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
George made no answer to these orders, but turning t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the troops, commanded them to draw their swords, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
march; that the Colonel seeing them advance a few pac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
on the right forwards, told his lordship he must march <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the left; that in the mean time Colonel Fitzroy arrivi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with orders for the British cavalry only to advance, Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
George said the orders were contradictory, and Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ligonier replied, they differed only in numbers, but th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
destination of his march was the same, to the left. Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Fitzroy, the third aide-du-camp to Prince Ferdinan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gave evidence, that when he told Lord George it was t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Prince's order for the British cavalry to advance towar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> left, his lordship observed that it was different from the
order brought by Colonel Ligonier, and he could n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
think the Prince intended to break the line; that he aske<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which way the cavalry was to march, and who was to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their guide; that when he (the aide-du-camp) offered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lead the column through the wood on the left, his lordshi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seemed still dissatisfied with the order, saying it did n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
agree with the order brought by Colonel Ligonier, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fired to be conducted in person to the Prince, that he migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have an explanation from his own mouth; a resolutio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which was immediately executed. The next evidence
an officer of rank in the army, made oath that, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opinion, when the orders were delivered to Lord George
his lordship was alarmed to a very great degree, an
seemed to be in the utmost confusion. A certain noble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
man, of high rank, and unblemisned reputation, declare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that Captain Winchingrode having told <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was abso∣lutely
necessary that the cavalry should march, and form
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line to support the foot, he had given orders to the secon
line to march; that as soon as they arrived at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
where the action began, he was met <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
with an order for the cavalry to advance as fast as possible
that in marching to this place, an order came to halt, unt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
they could be joined by the first line of cavalry that
afterwards, in advancing, they were again halted by Lord
George Sackville; that, in his opinion, they might have
marched with more expedition, and even come up time
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nough to act against the enemy: some other officers who
were examined on this subject agreed with the Marquis
in these sentiments.</P>
<P>§ V. Lord George, in his defence, proved, by unde∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iable
evidence, that he never received the orders issued on
the eve of the battle, nor any sort of intimation or plan of
action, although he was certainly entitled to some such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommunication, as commander in chief of the British
forces: that, nevertheless, the orders concerning the horses
were obeyed by those who received them; that Lord George
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstead of loitering or losing time while the troops
were forming, prepared to put himself at the head of the
cavalry on the first notice that they were in motion: that
he was so eager to perform his duty, as to set out from his
quarters without even waiting for an aide-du-camp to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttend him, and was in the field before any general officer
of his division. He declared, that when Captain Winch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngrode
delivered the order to form the cavalry in one line,
making a third, to advance and sustain the infantry, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either heard him say he was to march by the left, norsaw
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im point with his sword to the wood through which he
was to pass. Neither of these directions were observed by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny of the aides-du-camp or officers then present, except
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne gentleman, the person who bore witness to the con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion
in the looks and deportment of his lordship. It
was proved that the nearest and most practicable way of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvancing against the enemy was by the way of the wind∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill,
to the left of the village of Halen. It appeared that
Lord George imagined this was the only way by which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should be ordered to advance; that, in this persuasion,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had sent an officer to reconnoitre the village of Halen,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s an object of importance, as it would have been upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he flank of the cavalry in advancing forwards; that when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e received the order from Winchingrode to form the line,
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
and advance, he still imagined this was his route, and, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this supposition, immediately detached an aide-du-cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to remove a regiment of Saxe-Gotha, which was in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
front; that he sent a second to observe the place whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the infantry were, and a third to reconnoitre the enemy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and in a few minutes Colonel Ligonier coming up wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
an order from Prince Ferdinand to advance the cavalry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his lordship immediately drew his sword, and ordered then<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to march forward by the windmill. The colonel de¦clared
that when he delivered the order, he added “by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
left;” but Lord George affirmed that he heard no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
direction, nor didit reach the ears of any other person the
present, except of that officer who witnessed to the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
direction given by Winchingrode. It was proved tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
immediately after the troops were put in motion, Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Fitzroy arrived with an order from Prince Ferdinaud, im¦porting,
that the British cavalry only should advance b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the left; that Lord George declared their orders wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
contradictory, and seemed the more puzzled, as he under¦stood
that both these gentlemen came off nearly at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
same time from the Prince, and were probably directed t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
communicate the same order. It was, therefore, natura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to suppose there was a mistake, as there might be danger <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
breaking the line, as the route by the wood appeared mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
difficult and tedious than that by the windmill, which le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
directly through open ground to the enemy, and as h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
could not think that if a body of horse was immediatel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
wanted, the general would send for the British, that wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the farthest extremity of the wing, rather than for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hanoverian cavalry, who formed the left of the line, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
consequently were much nearer the seene of action. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was proved that Lord George, in this uncertainty, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦solved
to apply for an explanation to the Prince in person
who he understood was at a small distance; that with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
view, he set out with all possible expedition; that having
entered the wood, and perceived that the country beyon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it opened sooner to the left than he had imagined, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Captain Smith, his aide-du-camp, advising that the Britis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
cavalry should be put in motion, he sent back that gentle∣man,
with orders for them to advance by the left with all
possible dispatch; that he rode up to the general, who
received him without any marks of displeasure, and or∣dered
him to bring up the whole cavalry of the right wing
in a line upon the heath; an order, as the reader will
perceive, quite different from that which was so warmly
espoused by the aide-du-camp; that as the Marquis of
Granby had already put the second line in motion, ac∣cording
to a separate order which he had received, and the
head of his column was already in view, coming out of the
wood, Lord George thought it necessary to halt the troops
on the left, until the right should come into the line, and
afterwards send them orders to march flower, that two
regiments, which had been thrown out of the line, might
have an opportunity to replace themselves in their proper
stations.</P>
<P>§ VI. With respect to the confusion which one officer
affirmed was perceivable in the countenance and deport∣ment
of this commander, a considerable number of other
officers then present, being interrog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by his lordship,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unanimously declared that they saw no such marks of con∣fusion,
but that he delivered his orders with all the marks
of c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olness and deliberation. The candid reader will of
himself determine, whether a man's heart is to be judged
by any change of his complexion, granting such a change
to have happened; whether the evidence of one witness,
in such a case, will weigh against the concurrent testimony
of all the officers w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e immediate business it was to attend
and observe the commander: whether it was likely that
an officer, who had been more than once in actual service,
and behaved without reproach, so as to attain such an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rank in the army, should exhibit symptoms of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fear and confusion, when there was in reality no appear∣an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of danger; for none of the orders imported that he
should attack the enemy, but only advance to sustain the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfantry. The time which elapsed from the first order he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>received by Captain Winchingrode, to the arrival of Col-Ligonier,
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
did not exceed eight minutes, during which
his aide-du-camp, Captain Hugo, was employed in re∣moving
the Saxe Gotha regiment from the front, by which
he proposed to advance. From that period till the cavalry
actually marched, in consequence of an order from Lord
George, the length of time was differently estimated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the opinions of different witnesses, but, at a medium, co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣puted
by the judge advocate at fifteen minutes, during
which the following circumstances were transacted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
troops werefirst ordered to advance forwards, then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the contradictory orders arrived and were disputed; th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
commander desired the two aides-du-camp to agree <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
which was the precise order, and he would obey it imm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣diately;
each insisting upon that which he had delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lord George hastened to the general for an explanation
and, as he passed the wood, sent back Captain Smith <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the right of the cavalry, which was at a considerable
distance, to put the British horse in motion. We shal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not pretend to determine whether the commander of such
an important body may be excuseable for hesitating, when
he receives contradictory orders at the same time, especially
when both orders run counter to his own judgment; whe∣ther
in that case it is allowable for him to suspend the
operation for a few minutes, in order to consult in person
the commander in chief about a step of such consequence
to the preservation of the whole army. Neither will we
venture to decide dogmatically on the merits of the march,
after the cavalry were put in motion; whether they
marched too slow, or were unnecessarily halted, in their
way to the heath. It was proved, indeed, that Lord
George was always remarkably slow in his movements of
cavalry, on the supposition that if horses are blown they
must be unsit for service, and that the least hurry is ap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
disorder the line of horse to such a degree, as would rob
them of their proper effect, and render all their efforts
abortive. This being the system of Lord George Sack∣ville,
it may deseive consideration, whether he could de∣viate
from it on this delicate occasion, without renonncing
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
the dictates of his ownjudgment and discretion; and whe∣ther
he was at liberty to use his own judgment, after hav∣ing
received the order to advance. After all, whether he
was intentionally guilty, and what were the motives by
which he was really actuated, are questions which his
own conscieuce alone can solve. Even granting him to
have hesitated from perplexity, to have lingered from vex∣ation,
to have tailed through error of judgment, he will
probably find favour with the candid and humane part of
his fellow-su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jects, when they reflect upon the nature of
his situation, placed at the head of such a body of cavalry,
unit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>truct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and uninformed of plan or circumstance,
divided from the rest of the army, unacquainted with the
op<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations of the day, chagrined with doubt and disappoint∣ment,
and perplexed by contradictory orders▪ neither of
which he could execute without offering violence to his
own judgment; when they consider the endeavours he used
to mamfest his obedience; the last distinct order which he
in person received and executed; that mankind are liable
to mistakes; that the cavalry were not originally intended
to act, as appears in the account of the battle, published
at the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue, by the authority of Prince Ferdinand, ex∣pressly
declaring that the cav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lry on the right did not act,
because it was destined to sustain the infantry in a third
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne; that if it had really been designed for action it ought
either to have been posted in another place, or permitted
to advance straight forwards by the windmill, according to
the idea of its commander; siually, when they recall to
view the general confusion that seems to have prevailed
through the manoeuv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of that morning, and remember
some particulars of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> action; that the brigades of British
artillery had no orders until they applied to Lord George
Sackville, who directed them to the spot where they ac∣quitted
themselves with so much honour and eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, in
contributing to the success of the day; that the glory and
advantage acquired by the few br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gades of infantry, who
may be said to have defeated the whole French army, was
in no respect owing to any general or particular <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
instructions, bnt entirely flowing from the native valour of
the troops, and the spirited conduct of their immediate
commanders; and that a great number of officers in the
allied army, even of those who remained on the open heath,
never saw the face of the enemy, or saw them at such a
distance, that they could not distinguish more than the hats
and the arms of the British regiments with which they
were engaged. With respect to the imputation of cow∣ardice
levelled at Lord George by the unthinking mul∣titude,
and circulated with such industry and clamour, we
ought to consider it as a mob-accusation, which the bravest
of men, even the great Duke of Marlborough, could not
escape; we ought to receive it as a dangerous suspicion,
which strikes at the root of character, and may blast that
honour in a moment which the soldier has acquired in a
long course of painful service, at the continual hazard of
his life; we ought to distrust it as a malignant charge,
altogether inconsistent with the former conduct of the per∣son
accused, as well as with his subsequent impatience
and perseverance in demanding a trial, to which he never
would have been called; a trial which, though his life
was at stake, and his cause out of countenance, he sustained
with such courage, fortitude, and presence of mind, as
even his enemies themselves could not help admiring.
Thus have we given a succinct detail of this remark∣able
affair, with that spirit of impartiality, that sacred
regard to truth which the importance of history demands.
To the best of our recollection we have forgot no essential
article of the accusation, nor suppressed any material cir∣cumstance
urged in defence of Lord George Sackville.
Unknown to his person, unconnected with his friends, un∣moved
by fear, unbiassed by interest, we have candidly
obeyed the dictates of justice, and the calls of humanity,
in our endeavours to dissipate the clouds of prejudice and
misapprehension, warmed, perhaps, with an honest dis∣dain,
at the ungenerous, and, in our opinion, unjust per∣secution,
which, previous to his trial, an officer of rank,
service, and character, the descendant of an illustrious
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
family, the son of a nobleman universally respected, a Bri∣ton,
a fellow-subject, had undergone.</P>
<P>§ VII. The court-martial having examined the evi∣dence,
and heard the defence, gave judgment in these
words: “The court, upon due consideration of the whole
matter before them, is of opinion, that Lord George
Sackville is guilty of having disobeyed the orders of
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, whom he was, by his
commission and instructions, directed to obey as com∣mander
in chief, according to the rules of war, and it is
the further opinion of this court, that the said Lord
George Sackville is, and he is hereby adjudged, unfit to
serve his Majesty in any military capacity whatsoever.”
His sentence was confirmed by the King, who moreover
signified his pleasure that it should be given out in pub∣lick
orders, not only in Britain, but in America, and every
quarter of the globe, where any English troops happened
to be, that officers, being convinced that neither high
birth nor great employments can shelter offences of such a
nature, and that seeing they are subject to censures much
worse than death to a man who has any sense of honour,
they may avoid the fatal consequences arising from diso∣bedience
of orders. To complete the disgrace of this un∣fortunate
general, his Majesty in council called for the
council-book, and ordered the name of Lord George
Sackville, to be struck out of the list of privy-coun∣sellors.</P>
<P>§ VIII. This summer was distinguished by another
trial, still more remarkable. Laurence Earl Ferrers, a no∣bleman
of a violent spirit, who had committed many out∣rages,
and, in the opinion of all who knew him, given
manifold proofs of insanity, at length perpetrated a mur∣ther,
which subjected him to the cognizance of justice.
His deportment to his lady was so brutal, that applica∣tion
had been made to the House of Peers, and a sepa∣ration
effected by act of parliament. Trustees were
nominated; and one Mr. Johnson, who had, during the
best part of his life, been employed in the family, was now
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
appointed receiver of the estates, at the Earl's own request.
The conduct of this man, in the courte of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
gave umbrage to Lord Ferrers, whose disposit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was
equally jea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous and vindictive. He imagined all his own
family had conspired against his interest, and that Johnson
was one of their accomplices; that he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣mental
in obtaining the act of parliament, which his lord∣ship
considered as a grievous hardship; that he had disap∣pointed
him in regard to a certain contract about coal∣mines;
in a word, that there was collusion between
Johnson and the Earl's adversaries. Fired with these sup∣positions,
he first expressed his resentment, by giving
Johnson notice to quit the farm which he possessed on the
estate; but finding the trustees had confirmed the lease,
he determined to gratify his revenge by assassination, and
laid his plan accordingly. On Sunday the thirteenth of
January he appointed this unhappy man to come to his
house on the Friday following, in order to peruse pan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,
or settle accounts; and Johnson went thither without the
least suspicion of what was prepared for his reception: for
although he was no stranger to his lordship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s dangerous
disposition, and knew he had some time before incurred his
displeasure, yet he imagined his resentment had entirely
subsided, as the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l had of late behaved to him with remark∣able
complacency. He, therefore, at the time appointed,
repaired to his lordship's house of Staton, in Leicester∣shire,
at the distance of a short mile from his own habi∣tation,
and was admitted by a maid servant. The Earl
had dismissed every person in the house, upon various pre∣tences,
except three women, who were left in the kitchen.
Johnson advancing to the door of his apartment was re∣ceived
by his lordship, who desired him to walk into ano∣ther
room, where he joined him in a few minutes, and
then the door was locked on the inside. After a great
deal of warm expostulation, the Earl insisted upon his sub∣scribing
a paper, acknowledging himself a villain; and on
his refusing to comply with this demand, declared he would
put him to death. In vain the unfortunate man remon∣strated
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
against this cruel injustice, and deprecated the in∣dignation
of this surious nobleman. He remained deaf to
all his intreaties, drew forth a pistol, which he had loaded
for the purpose, and commanding him to implore heaven's
mercy on his knees, shot him through the body, while he
remained in that supplicating attitude. The consequence
of this violence was not immediate death; but his lord∣ship,
seeing the wretched victim still alive and sensible,
though agonised with pain, felt a momentary motion of
pity. He ordered his servants to convey Mr. Johnson up
stairs to a bed, to send for a surgeon, and give immediate
notice of the accident to the wounded man's family. When
Mr. Johnson's daughter came to the house, she was met by
the Earl, who told her he had shot her father on purpose,
and with deliberation. The same declaration he made to
the surgeon, on his arrival. He stood by him while he
examined the wound, described the manner in which the
ball had pen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trated, and seemed surprised that it should be
lodged within the body. When he demanded the sur∣geon's
opinion of the wound, the operator thought proper
to temporise, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is own safety, as well as for the sake of
the publick, left the Earl should take some other desperate
step, or endeavour to escape. He, therefore, amused him
with hopes of Johnson's recovery, about which he now
seemed extremely anxious. He supported his spirits by
immoderate drinking, after having retired to another
apartment with the surgeon, whom he desired to take all
possible care of his patient. He declared, however, that
he did not r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pent of what he had done; that Johnson was a
villain, who deserved to die; that, in case of his death, he
(the Earl) would surrender himself to the house of Peers,
and take his trial. He said he could justify the action to
his own conscience; and owned his intention was to
have killed Johnson outright; but as he still survived, and
was in pain, he desired that all possible means might be
used for his recovery. Nor did he seem altogether ne∣glectful
of his own safety: he endeavoured to tamper with
the surgeon, and suggest what evidence he should give
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
when called before a court of justice. He continued to
drink himself into a state of intoxication, and all the cruelty
of his hate seemed to return. He would not allow the
wounded man to be removed to his own house, saying, he
would keep him under his own roof, that he might plague
the villain. He returned to the chamber where Johnson
lay, insulted him with the most opprobrious language,
threatened to shoot him through the head, and could
hardly be restrained from committing further acts of vio∣lence
on the poor man, who was already in extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y.
After he retired to bed, the surgeon procured a sufficient
number of assistants, who conveyed Mr. Johnson in an
easy chair to his own house, where he expired that same
morning in great agonies. The same surgeon assembled a
number of armed men to seise the murtherer, who at first
threatened resistance, but was soon apprehended, endea∣vouring
to make his escape, and committed to the county
prison. From thence he was conveyed to London by the
jailer of Leicester, and conducted by the usher of the Black
Rod and his deputy into the House of Lords, where the co∣roner's
inquest, and the affidavits touching the murther,
being read, the jailer delivered up his prisoner to the care
of Black Rod, and he was immediately committed to the
Tower. He appeared very calm, composed, and uncon∣cerned,
from the time of his being apprehended; conversed
coolly on the subject of his imprisonment; made very per∣tinent
remarks upon the nature of the habeas corpus act of
parliament, of which he hoped to avail himself; and when
he withdrew from the House of Peers, desired he might
not be visited by any of his relations or acquaintances.
His understanding, which was naturally good, had been
well cultivated; his arguments were rational, but his
conduct was frantick.</P>
<P>§ IX. The circumstances of this assassination appeared
so cruel and deliberate, that the people cried aloud for
vengeance; and the government gave up the offender
to the justice of his country. The Lord-Keeper Henley
was appointed lord high steward for the trial of Earl
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
Ferrers, and sat in state with all the peers and judges in
Westminster-hall, which was for this purpose converted
into a very august tribunal. On the sixteenth day of
April the delinquent was brought from the Tower in a
coach, attended by the major of the Tower, the gen∣tleman-jailer,
the wardours, and a detachment of the
foot-guards. He was brought into court about ten; and
the lord-steward with the peers taking their places, he
was arraigned aloud in the midst of an infinite concourse of
people, including many foreigners, who seemed wonder∣fully
struck with the magnificence and solemnity of the
tribunal. The murther was fully proved by unquestion∣able
evidence: but the Earl pleaded insanity of mind;
and, in order to establish this plea, called many witnesses
to attest his lunacy in a variety of instances, which seemed
too plainly to indicate a disordered imagination: unfound∣ed
jealousy of plots and conspiracies, unconnected ravings,
fits of mufing, incoherent ejaculations, sudden starts of
fury, denunciations of unprovoked revenge, frantick
gesticulations, and a strange caprice of temper, were
proved to have distinguished his conduct and deportment.
It appeared that lunacy had been a family taint, and
affected divers of his lordship's relations, that a sollicitor
of reputation had renounced his business, on the full
persuasion of his being disordered in his brain; that,
long before this unhappy event, his nearest relations had
deliberated upon the expediency of taking out a commission
of lunacy against him, and were prevented by no other
reason than the apprehension of being convicted of <HI>scan∣dalum
magnatum,</HI> should the jury find his lordship <HI>compos
mentis;</HI> a circumstance which in all probability would have
happened, inasmuch as the Earl's madness did not appear in
his conversation, but in his conduct. A physician of
eminence, whose practice was confined to persons la∣bouring
under this infirmity, declared that the particu∣lars
of the Earl's deportment and personal behaviour
seemed to indicate lunacy. Indeed, all his neighbours
and acquaintances had long considered him as a madman;
and a certain noble lord declared in the House of Peers,
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
when the bill of separation was on the carpet, that he
looked upon him in the light of a maniac; and that,
if some effectual step was not taken to divest him of the
power of doing mischief, he did not doubt but that one
day they should have occasion to try him for murther.
The lawyers who managed the prosecution in behalf of
the crown endeavoured to invalidate the proofs of his
lunacy, by observing, that his lordship was never so much
deprived of his reason but that he could distinguish be∣tween
good and evil; that the murther he had committed
was the effect of revenge for a conceived injury of some
standing; that the malice was deliberate, and the plan
artfully conducted; that immediately after the deed was
perpetrated the Earl's conversation and reasoning was
cool and consistent, until he drank himself into a state of
intoxication; that, in the opinion of the greatest lawyers,
no criminal can avail himself of the plea of lunacy, pro∣vided
the crime was committed during a lucid interval:
but his lordship, far from exhibiting any marks of insanity,
had, in the course of this trial, displayed uncommon u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣derstanding
and sagacity in examining the witness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
and making many shrewd and pertinent observations on
the evidence which was given. These sentiments were
conformable to the opinion of the peers, who unani∣mously
declared him guilty.—After all, in examining
the vicious actions of a man who has betrayed mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
and manifold symptoms of insanity, it is not e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
to distinguish those which are committed during the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
interval. The suggestions of madness are often momentary
and transient: the determinations of a lunatick, though
generally rash and instantaneous, are sometimes the re∣sult
of artful contrivance; but there is always an abs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣dity
which is the criterion of the disease, either in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣mises
or conclusion. The Earl, it is true, had formed a
deliberate plan for the perpetration of the murther; but
he had taken no precautions for his own safety or escape:
and this neglect will the more plainly appear to have
been the criterion of insanity, if we reflect that he
<PB N="187" REF="192"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stified what he had done as a meritorious action; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clared he would, upon Mr. Johnson's death, surrender
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mself to the House of Lords. Had he been impelled
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this violence by a sudden gust of passion, it could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expected that he should have taken any measure for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own preservation; but as it was the execution of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliberate scheme, and his lordship was by no means
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve in point of ingenuity, he might easily have con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived
means for concealing the murther, until he should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accomplished his escape: and, in our opinion, any
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a madman would either have taken some such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sures, or formed some plan for the concealment of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn guilt. The design itself seems to have been rather an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tended sacrifice to justice than a gratification of r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venge.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her do we think that the sanity of his mind was ascer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined
by the accuracy and del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ration with which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de his remarks, and examin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the evidence at his trial.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> influence of his phrenzy might be past; though it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no sign of sound reason to supply the prosecutor with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
such an argument to his prejudice. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his judgement
been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eally unimpaired, he might have assumed the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asque of lunacy for his own preservation.</P>
<P>§ X. The tryal was continued for two days; and on
the third the Lord Steward▪ after having made a short
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> touching the Kemous nature of the offence, pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounced
the same sentence of death upon the Earl which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> factors of the lowest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> go; that from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower, in which h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was imprisoned, he should, on the
Monday following, be led to the common place of exe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ution,
there to be hanged by the neck, and his body
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwards diffected and anatomized. This last part of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sentence seemed to shock the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmal extremely: he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanged colour, his jaw quivered, and he appeared to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n great agitation; but during the remaining part of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he behaved with surprising composure, and even un∣concern.
After he had received sentence, the lords his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by virtue of a power ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied in them, respited his
execution for one month, that he might have time to
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
settle his temporal and spiritual concerns. Before sentence
was passed, the Earl read a paper, in which he begged
pardon of their lordships for the trouble he had given, as
well as for having, against his own inclination, pleaded
lunacy at the request of his friends. He thanked them
for the candid trial with which he had been indulged,
and entreated their lordships to recommend him to the
King for mercy. He afterwards sent a letter to his Ma∣jesty,
remonstrating, that he was the representative of a
very ancient and honourable family, which had been
allied to the crown; and requesting, that if he could not
be favoured with the species of death which, in cases of
treason, distinguishes the nobleman from the plebeian,
he might at least, out of consideration for his family, be
allowed to suffer in the Tower, rather than at the com∣mon
place of execution: but this indulgence was refused.
From his return to the Tower to the day of his execution
he betrayed no mark of apprehension or impatience; but
regulated his affairs with precision, and conversed with∣out
concern or restraint.</P>
<P>§ XI. On the fifth day of May, his body being de∣manded
by the sheriffs at the Tower-gate, in consequence
of a writ under the great seal of England, directed to the
lieutenant of the Tower, his lordship desired permission
to go in his own landau, and appeared gaily dressed in a
light-coloured suit of clothes, embroidered with silver.
He was attended in the landau by one of the sheriffs, and
the chaplain of the Tower, followed by the chariots of
the sheriffs, a mourning-coach and six filled with his
friends, and a hearse for the conveyance of his body.
He was guarded by a posse of constables, a party of horse∣grenadiers,
and a detachment of infantry; and in this
manner the procession moved from the Tower, through
an infinite concourse of people, to Tyburn, where the
gallows, and a seaffold erected under it, appeared covered
with black baise. The Earl behaved with great com∣posure
to Mr. Sheriff Vaillant, who attended him in the
landau: he observed, that the gaity of his apparel might
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
seem odd on such an occasion; but that he had particular
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easons for wearing that suit of clothes: he took notice of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vast multitude which crouded around him, brought
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hither, he supposed, by curiosity to see a nobleman hanged:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e told the sheriff he had applied to the King, by letter,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he might be permitted to die in the Tower, where
the Earl of Essex, one of his ancestors, had been behead∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; an application
which, he said, he had made with the more confidence, as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had the honour to quarter part of his Majesty's arms.
He expressed some displeasure at being executed as a
common felon, exposed to the eyes of such a multitude.
The chaplain, who had never been admitt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to him before,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inting that some account of his lordship's sentiments on re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igion
would be expected by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> publick, he made answer,
that he did not think himself accountable to the publick
for his private sentiments; that he had always adored one
God, the creator of the universe; and, with respect to
any particular opinions of his own, he had never propa∣gated
them, or endeavoured to make proselytes, because
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethought it was criminal to disturb the established reli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
of his country, as Lord B—had done, by
the publication of his writings. He added, that the great
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber of sects, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> multiplication of religious dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utes,
had almost banished morality. With regard to
the crime for which he suffered, he declared that he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o malice against Mr. Johnson; and that the murther
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as owing to a perturbation of mind, occasioned by a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariety of crosses and vexations. When he approached
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> place of execution, he expressed an earnest desire to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and take leave of a certain person who waited in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ach; a person for whom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e entertained the most sincere
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gard and affection: but the sheriff prudently observing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at such an interview might shock him, at a time when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had occasion for all his fortitude and recollection, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quieseed in the justness of the remark, and delivered to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im a pocket-book, a ring, and a purse, desiring they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight be given to that person, whom he now declined
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
seeing. On his arrival at Tyburn he came out of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
landau, and ascended the scaffold with a firm step and
undaunted countenance. He refused to join the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aplai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in his devotions; but kneeling with him on black cus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions
he repeated the Lord's Prayer, which, he said, he had al∣ways
admired; and added with great energy, “O Lord
forgive me all my errors, pardon all my sins.” After
this exercise, he presented his watch to Mr. Sheriff Vai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lant,
thanked him and the other gentleman for all thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
civilities; and signified his desire of being bur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Breden, or Stanton, in Leicestershire. Finally, he gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣fied
the executioner with a purse of money: then, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
halter being adjusted to his neck, he stepped upon a littl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
stage, erected upon springs, on the middle of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and the cap being pulled over his eyes, the sheriff made<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
signal, at which the stage fell from under his feet, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was left suspended. His body, having hung an hour and
five minutes, was cut down, placed in the hearse, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
conveyed to the publick theatre for dissection, where bein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
opened, and lying for some days as the subject of a pub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
lecture, at length it was carried off, and privat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
terred. Without all doubt, this unhappy noblem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
disposition was so dangerously mischievous, that it becam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
necessary for the good of society, either to confirm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
for life, as an incorrigible lunatick, or give him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

are raised by many illustrious distinctions above the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>
of plebeians, and as they are eminently distinguished from
them in suffering punishment for high treason, which the
law considers as the most atrocious crime that can be com∣mitted,
it might not be unworthy of the notice of the
legislature to deliberate whether some such pre-eminence
ought not to be extended to noblemen convicted of other
crimes; in order to alleviate as much as possible the dis∣grace
of noble families, which have deserved well of their
country; to avoid any circumstances that may tend to
diminish the lustre of the English nobility in the eyes of
foreign nations; or to bring it in contempt with the com∣mon
people of our own, already too licentious, and prone
to abolish those distinctions which serve as the basis of
decorum, order, and subordination.</P>
<P>§ XII. Homicide is the reproach of England: one
would imagine there is something in the climate of this
country, that not only disposes the natives to this inhuman
outrage, but even infects foreigners who reside among
them. Certain it is, high passions will break out into
the most enormous violences in that country where they
are least controlled by the restrait of regulation and dis∣cipline,
and it is equally certain, that in no civilized
country under the sun there is such a r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laxation of dis∣cipline,
either religious or civil, as in England. The month
of August produced a remarkable instance of desperate
revenge, perpetrated by one Stirn, a native of Hesse-Cassel,
inslamed and exasperated by a false punctilio of honour.
This unhappy young man was descended of a good family,
and possessed many accomplishments both of mind and
person: but his character was di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inguished by such a jea∣lous
sensibility, as rendered him unhappy in himself, and
disagreeable to his acquaintance. After having for some
years performed the office of usher in a boarding school,
he was admitted to the house of one Mr. Matthews, a
surgeon, in order to teach him the classicks, and instruct
his children in musick, which he perfectly understood.
He had not long reside<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this family, when the surgeon
took umbrage at some part of his conduct, taxed him
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
roughly with fraud and ingratitude, and insisted upon his
removing to another lodging. Whether he rej<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted this
intimation, or found diffculty in procuring another apart∣ment,
the surgeon resolved to expel him by violence,
called in the assistance of a peace-officer, and turned him out
into the street in the night, after having loaded him with
the most provoking reproaches. These injuries and dis∣graces
operating upon a mind jealous by nature, and galled
by adversity, produced a kind of phrenzy of resentment,
and he took the desperate resolution of sacrificing Mat∣thews
to his revenge. Next day, having provided a case
of pistols, and charged them for the occasion, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣forced
his rage by drinking an unusual quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and repairing in the evening to a pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick-house which
Mr. Matthews frequented in the neighbourhood of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.
Garden. There he accordingly found the unhappy vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m
sitting with some of his friends; and the surgeon, inst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad
of palliating his former conduct, began to insult him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with the most opprobious invectives. Stirn, exasp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
by this additional indignity, pulled his pistols from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is
bosom, shot the surgeon, who immediately expired and
discharged the other at his own breast▪ though his con∣fusion
was such that it did not take effect. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣prehended
on the spot, and conveyed to prison, where,
for some days, he refused all kind of sustenance, but
afterwards became more composed. At his trial he
pleaded insanity of mind; but being found guilty, he
resolved to anticipate the execution of the sentence.
That same evening he drank poison; and notwithstanding
all the remedies that could be administered, died in strong
convulsions. His body was publickly dissected, accord∣ing
to the sentence of the law, and afterwards interred
with those marks of indignity which are reserved for the
perpetrators of suicide.</P>
<P>§ XIII. We shall close the domestick occurrences of
this year with an account of two incidents▪ which, though,
of a very different nature in respect to each other, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver∣theless
concurred in demonstrating that the internal
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
wealth and vigour of the nation were neither drained nor
diminished by the enormous expense and inconveniencies
of the war. The committee appointed to manage the un∣dertaking
for a new bridge over the river Thames at
Black-friars having received and examined a variety of
plans presented by different artists, at length gave the
preference to the design of one Mr. Mylne, a young archi∣tect,
a native of North-Britain, just returned from the
prosecution of his studies at Rome, where he had gained
the prize in the capital, which the academy of that city
bestows on him who produces the most beautiful and use∣ful
plan on a given subject of architecture. This young
man being in London, on his return to his own country,
was advised to declare himself a candidate for the superin∣tendency
of the new bridge; and the plan which he pre∣sented
was approved and adopted. The place being
already ascertained, the lord-mayor of London, attended
by the committee, and a great concourse of people, re∣paired
to Black-friars, and laid the first stone of the
bridge, placing upon it a plate, with an inscription, which
does more honour to the publick spirit of the undertakers
than to the classical taste of the author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ultimo die Octobris, anno ab incarnatione MDCCLX, Auspicatissimo principe Georgio Tertio Regnum jam inuente, Pontis hujus, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eipubli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> commodum Urbisque majestatem (Latè <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flagrante bello) à S.

The other
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
instance that denoted the wealth and spirit of the nation,
was the indifference and unconcern with which they bore
the loss of a vast magazine of naval stores belonging to
the dock-yard at Portsmouth, which, in the month of
July, was set on fire by lightning, and consisting of
combustibles, burned with such fury, notwithstanding all
the endeavours of the workmen in the yard, the sailors
in the harbour, and the troops in the town, that before
a stop was put to the conflagration, it had consumed a
variety of stores, to an immense value. The damage,
however, was so immediately repaired, that it had no sort
of effect in disconcerting any plan, or even in retarding
any naval preparation.</P>
<P>§ XIV. How important these preparations must have
been may be judged from the prodigious increase of the
navy, which, at this juncture, amounted to one hundred
and twenty ships of the line, besides frigates, fireships,
sloops, bombs, and tenders. Of these capital ships,
seventeen were stationed in the East-Indies, twenty for
the defence of the West-India Islands, twelve in North-America,
ten in the Mediterranean, and sixty-one, either
on the coast of France, in the harbours of England, or
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ising in the English seas for the protection of the Bri∣tish
commerce. Notwithstanding these numerous and
powerful armaments, the enemy, who had not a ship of
the lin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at sea, were so alert with their small privateers and
armed vessels, that, in the beginning of this year, from
the first of March to the tenth of June, they had made prize
of two hundred vessels belonging to Great-Britain and
Ireland. The whole number of British ships taken by
them, from the first day of June, in the year one thou∣sand
seven hundred and fifty-six, to the first of June in
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
the present year, amounted to two thousand five hundred
and thirty-nine; of these seventy-eight were privateers,
three hundred and twenty-one were re-taken, and about
the same number ransomed. In the same space of time,
the British cruisers had made captures of nine hundred and
forty-four vessels, including two hundred and forty-two
privateers, many fishing-boats and small coasters, the value
of which hardly defrayed the expense of condemnation.
That such a small proportion of ships should be taken from
the enemy is not at all surprising, when we consider the
terrible shocks their commerce had previously received,
and the great number of their mariners imprisoned in
England: but the prodigious number of British vessels
taken by their petty coasting privateers, in the face of
such mighty armaments, numerous cruisers, and convoys,
seems to argue, that either the English ships of war were
inactive or improperly disposed, or that the merchants
hazarded their ships without convoy. Certain it is, in
the course of this year we find fewer prizes taken from
the enemy, and fewer exploits atchieved at sea, than we
had occasion to record in the annals of the past. Not
that the present year is altogether barren of events which
rebound to the honour of our marine commanders. We
have, in recounting the transactions of the preceding
year, mentioned a small armament equipped at Dunkirk,
under the command of M. de Thurot, who, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of all the vigilance of the British commander statiONE in
the Downs, found means to escape from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rbour in
the month of October last, and arrived at Gott<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aburgh,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Sweden, from whence he proceeded to Bergen, in Nor∣way.
His instructions were to make occasional descents
upon the coast of Ireland, and, by dividing the troops,
and distracting the attention of the government in that
kingdom, to facilitate the enterprise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> M. De Conslans,
the fate of which we have already <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrated. The origi∣nal
armament of Thurot consist <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of five ships, one of
which, called the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reschat de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was mounted
with forty-four guns; the Begon, the Blond, the Terp∣sichore,
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
sichore, had thirty guns each, and the Marante carried
twenty-four. The number of soldiers put on board this
little fleet did not exceed one thousand two hundred and
seventy, exclusive of mariners, to the number of seven
hundred; but two hundred of the troops were sent sick
on shore, before the armament sailed from Dunkirk;
and in their voyage between Gottenburgh and Bergen they
lost company of the Begon, during a violent storm. The
severity of the weather detained them nineteen days at
Bergen, at the expiration of which they set sail for the
western islands of Scotland, and discovered the northern
part of Ireland in the latter end of January. The in∣tention
of Thurot was to make a descent about Derry;
but before this design could be executed, the weather
growing tempestuous, and the wind blowing off shore,
they were driven out to sea, and in the night lost sight
of the Marante, which never joined them in the sequel.
After having been tempest-beaten for some time, and ex∣posed
to a very scanty allowance of provision, the officers
requested of Thurot that he would return to France,
lest they should all perish by famine; but he lent a deaf <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar
to this proposal, and frankly told them he could not re∣turn
to France without having struck some stroke for the
service of his country. Nevertheless, in hopes of meeting
with some refreshment, he steered to the island or Isla,
where the troops were landed, and here they found black
cattle, and a small supply of oatmeal, for which they paid
a reasonable price; and it must be owned, Thurot him∣self
behaved with great moderation and generosity.</P>
<P>§ XV. While this spirited adventurer struggled with
these wants and difficulties, his arrival in those seas silled
the whole kingdom with alarm. Bodies of regular troop;
and militia were posted along the coasts of Ireland and
Scotland; and besides the squadron of Commodore Boys,
who sailed to the northward on purpose to pursue the
enemy, other ships of war were ordered to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our the
Bristol channel, and cruise between Scotland and Ire∣land.
The weather no sooner permitted Thurot to pur∣sue
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
his destination, than he sailed from Isla to the bay of
Carrickfergus, in Ireland, and made all the necessary
preparations for a descent; which was accordingly effected
with six hundred men, on the twenty-first day of Febru∣ary.
Lieutenant-Colonel Jennings, who commanded
four companies of raw undisciplined men at Carrickfergus,
having received information that three ships had anchored
about two miles and a half from the castle, which was
ruinous and defenceless, immediately detached a party to
make observations, and ordered the French prisoners
there confined to be removed to Belfast. Mean while,
the enemy landing without opposition, advanced towards
the town, which they found as well guarded as the nature
of the place, which was entirely open, and the circum∣stances
of the English commander, would allow. A re∣gular
attack was carried on, and a spirited defence made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One circumstance that attended this dispute deserven to be transmitted to posterity, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an instance of that courage, mingled with humanity, which constitutes true heroism. While the French and English were hotly en∣gaged in one of the streets, a little child <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an playfully between them, having no idea of the danger to which it was exposed: a common soldier of the enemy, perceiving the life of this poor innocent at stake, grounded his piece, advanced deliberately between the line<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of fire, took up the child in his arms, conveyed it to a place of safety; then returning to his place, resumed his musket, and renewed his hostility.</NOTE>,
untill the ammunition of the English failed: then Colonel
Jennings retired in order to the castle, which, however,
was in all respects untenable; for, besides a breach in the
wall near fifty feet wide, they found themselves destitute
of provision and ammunition. Nevertheless, they re∣pulsed
the assailants in their first attack even after the
gate was burst open, and supplied the want of shot with
stones and rubbish. At length the Colonel and his
troops were obliged to surrender, on condition that they
should not be sent prisoners to France, but be ransomed,
by sending thither an equal number of French prisoners
from Great-Britain or Ireland: that the castle should not
be demolished, nor the town of Carrickfergus plundered
or burned, on condition that the mayor and corporation
should furnish the French troops with necessary provisions.
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
The enemy, after this exploit, did not presume to advance
farther into the country; a step which indeed they could
not have taken with any regard to their own safety; for
by this time a considerable body of regular troops was
ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbled; and the people of the country manifest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a
laudable spirit of loyalty and resolution, crowding in great
numbers to Belfast, to offer their service against the in∣vaders.
These circumstances, to which the enemy were no
strangers, and the defeat of Conflans, which they had
also learned, obliged them to quit their conquest, and re∣embark
with some precipit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, after having laid Carrick∣fergus
under moderate contribution.</P>
<P>§ XVI. The fate they escaped on shore they soon met
with at sea. Captain John Elliot, who commanded three
frigates at Kinsale, and had, in the course of this war, more
than once already distinguished himself, even in his early
youth, by extraordinary acts of valour, was informed by
a dispatch from the Duke of Bedford, lord-lieutenant of
Ireland, that three of the enemy's ships lay at anchor in
the bay of Carrickfergus, and thither he immediately
shaped his course in the ship Aeolus, accompanied by the
Pallas and Brilliant, under the command of the Captains
Clements and Logie. On the twenty-eighth day of
February they descried the enemy, and gave chase, in sight
of the Isle of Mann; and about nine in the morning, Cap∣tain
Elliot, in his own ship, engaged the Belleisle, com∣manded
by Thurot, although considerably his superior
in strength of men, number of guns, and weight of metal.
In a few minutes his consorts were also engaged with the
other two ships of the enemy. After a warm action,
maintained with great spirit on all sides for an hour and
a half, Captain Elliot's lieutenant boarded the Belleisle,
and, striking her colours with his own hand, the com∣mander
submitted: his example was immediately followed
by the other French captains, and the English commo∣dore,
taking possession of his prizes, conveyed them into
the bay of Ramsay, in the Isle of Mann, that their damage
might be repaired. Though the Belleisle was very leaky,
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>
and had lost her boltsprit, mizen-mast, and main-yard,
in all probability the victory would not have been so easily
obtained, had not the gallant Thurot fallen during the
action. The victor had not even the consolation to per∣form
the last offices to his brave enemy; for his body was
thrown into the sea by his own people in the hurry of the
engagement. The loss on the side of the English did not
exceed forty men killed and wounded, whereas above three
hundred of the enemy were slain or disabled. The service
performed on this occasion was deemed so essential to the
peace and commerce of Ireland, that the thanks of the
House of Commons in that kingdom were voted to the
conquerors of Thurot, as well as to Lieutenant-Colonel
Jennings, for his spirited behaviour at Carrickfergus; and
the freedom of the city of Cork was presented in silver
boxes to the Captains Elliot, Clements, and Logie. The
name of Thurot was become terrible to all the trading
sea-ports of Great-Britain and Ireland; and therefore the
defeat and capture of his squadron were celebrated with
as hearty rejoicings as the most important victory could
have produced.</P>
<P>§ XVII. In the beginning of April another engage∣ment
between four frigates, still more equally matched, had
a different issue, though not less honourable for the British
commanders. Captain Skinner, of the Biddeford, and
Captain Kennedy, of the Flamborough, both frigates,
sailed on a cruise from Lisbon; and on the fourth day of
April fell in with two large French frigates, convoy to a
fleet of merchant-ships, which the English captains im∣mediately
resolved to engage. The enemy did not decline
the battle, which began about half an hour after six in the
evening, and raged with great fury till eleven. By this
time the Flamborough had lost sight of the Biddeford, and
the frigate with which Captain Kennedy was engaged
bore away with all the sail she could carry. He pursued
her till noon the next day, when she had left him so far
astern, that he lost sight of her, and returned to Lisbon,
with the loss of fifteen men killed and wounded, including
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
the lieutenant of marines, and considerable damage both
in her hull and rigging. In three days he was joined by
the Biddeford, which however compelled her antagonist
to give way, and pursued her till she was out of sight. In
about an hour after the action began, Captain Skinner was
killed by a cannon-ball, and the command devolved to
Lieutenant Knollis, son to the Earl of Banbury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Five sons of this nobleman were remarkably distinguished in this war ▪ The fourth and fifth were dangerously wounded at the battle of Minden: the second was hunt in the reduction of Guadaloupe: Lord Wallingford, the eldest, received a shot at Carrickfergu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and the third was slain in this engagement.</NOTE>, who
maintained the battle with great spirit, even after he was
wounded, until he received a second shot in his body,
which proved mortal. Then the master assuming the
direction, continued the engagement with equal resolution,
untill the enemy made his escape, which he the more easily
accomplished, as the Biddeford was disabled in her masts
and rigging.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The bravery of five Irishmen and a boy,
belonging to the crew of a ship from Waterford, deserves
commemoration. The ship, in her return from Bilboa,
laden with brandy and iron, being taken by a French
privateer off Ushant, about the middle of April, the cap∣tors
removed the master and all the hands but these five
men and the boy, who were left to assist nine Frenchmen
in navigating the vessel to France. These stout Hiber∣nians
immediately formed a plan of insurrection, and
executed it with success. Four of the French mariners
being below deck, three aloft among the rigging, one at the
helm, and another walking the deck, Brian, who headed
the enterprise, tripped up the heels of the French st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers∣man,
seised his pistol, and discharged it at him who walked
the deck, but missing the mark, he knocked him down
with the butt-end of the piece. At the same time hollow∣ing
to his confederates below, they assailed the enemy with
their own broad-swords, and soon compelling them to
submit, came upon deck, and shut the hatches. Brian
being now in possession of the quarter-deck, those who
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
were aloft called for quarter, and surrendered without
opposition. The Irish having thus obtained a complete
victory, almost without bloodshed, and secured the pri∣soners,
another difficulty occurred: neither Brian nor any
of his associates could read or write, or knew the least
principle of navigation; but sup osing his course to be
north, he steered at venture, and the first land he made
was the neighbourhood of Youghall, where he happily
arrived with his prisoners.</P>
<P>§ XIX. The only considerable damage sustained by the
navy of Great-Britain, since the commencement of this
year, was the loss of the Ramillies, a magnificent ship
of the second rate, belonging to the squadron which
Admiral Boscawen commanded on the coast of France
in order to watch the motions and distress the commerce
of that restless, enterprising enemy. In the beginning
of February a series of stormy weather obliged the
admiral to return from the bay of Quiberon to Ply∣mouth,
where he arrived with much difficulty; but the
Ramillies overshot the entrance to the Sound, and being
embayed near a point called the Boit-head, about four
leagues higher up the channel, was dashed in pieces
among the rocks, after all her anchors and cables had
given way. All her officers and men, amounting to seven
hundred, perished on this occasion, except one midship∣man
and twenty-five mariners, who had the good fortune
to save themselves by leaping on the rocks, as the hull was
thrown forwards, and raised up by the succeeding billows.
Such were the most material tranfactions of the year,
relating to the British empire in the seas of Europe.</P>
<P>§ XX. We shall now transport the reader to the con∣tinent
of North-America, which, as the theatre of war,
still maintained its former importance. The French
emissaries from the province of Louisiana had exercised their
arts of insinuation with such success among the Chero∣kees,
a numerous and powerful nation of Indians, settled
on the consines of Virginia and Carolina, that they had
infringed the peace with the English towards the latter
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>
end fo the last year, and begun hostilities, by plundering,
massacring, and scalping several British subjects of the
more southern provinces. Mr. Lyttelton, governour of
South-Carolina, having received information of these out∣rages,
obtained the necessary aids from the assembly of his
province, for maintaining a considerable body of forces,
which was raised with great expedition. He marched in
the beginning of October, at the head of eight hundred
provincials, re-enforced with three hundred regular troops,
and penetrated into the heart of the country possessed by
the Cherokees, who were so much intimidated by his
vigour and dispatch, that they sent a deputation of their
chiefs to sue for peace, which was re-established by a new
treaty, dictated by the English governour. They obliged
themselves to renounce the French interest; to deliver
up all the spies and emissaries of that nation then resident
among them; to surrender to justice those of their own
people who had been concerned in murthering and scalp∣ing
the British subjects; and for the performance of these
articles two-and-twenty of their head men were put as
hostages into the hands of the governour. So little re∣gard,
however, was paid by these savages to this solemn ac∣commodation,
that Mr. Lyttelton had been returned but a
few days from their country, when they attempted to sur∣prise
the English fort Prince George, near the frontiers of
Carolina, by going thither in a body, on pretence of de∣livering
up some murtherers; but the commanding officer
perceiving some suspicious circumstances in their be∣haviour,
acted with such vigilance and circumspection as
entirely frustrated their design<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This attempt was conducted in the following manner, havi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been conce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with the two-and-twenty hollages who resided in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ On the sixteenth day of February, two Indian women appearing at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, on the other side of the river, Mr. Dogharty, one of the officers of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went out to ask them what news.

On the third day of March, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt at Ninety six <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attacked by two hundred Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rokee Indians with mus∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try, which had little or no effect, so that they were fore d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to retire with some loss, and revenged themselves on the open country, burning and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avaring all the houses and plantations belonging to English s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttlers in this part of the country, and all along the frontiers of Virginia. Not contented with pillaging and destroying the habitations, they wantoned in the most horrible barbarities; and their motions were so secret and sudden, that it was impossible for the inhabitants to know where the storm would burst, or take proper precautions for their own defence, so that a great number of the back settlements were totally abandoned.</NOTE>. Thus disappointed,
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
they wreaked their vengeance upon the English subjects
trading in their country, all of whom they butchered
without mercy. Not contented with this barbarous sa∣crifice,
they made incursions to the British settlements at
the Long Lanes, and the forks of the Broad River, and
massacred about forty defenceless colonists, who reposed
themselves in full security on the peace so lately ratified.
As views of interest could not have induced them to act in
this manner, and their revenge had not been inflamed by
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
and fresh provocation, these violences must be imputed
to the instigation of French incendiaries; and too plainly
evinced the necessity of crowing our American conquests
with the reduction of Louisiana, from whence these
emissaries were undoubtedly dispatched.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The cruelty and mischief with which the Che∣rokees
prosecuted their renewed hostilities alarmed all the
southern colonies of the English; and application was
made for assistance to Mr. Amherst, the commander in
chief of the King's forces in America. He forthwith
detached twelve hundred chosen men to South-Carolina,
under the command of Colonel Montgomery, brother to
the Earl of Eglinton, an officer of approved conduct, and
distinguished gallantry. Immediately after his arrival at
Charles-town, he advanced to Ninety-six, and proceeded
to Twelve-mile River, which he passed in the beginning of
June, without opposition. He continued his route by
forced marches, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of
the Indian town called Little Keowee, where he encamped
in an advantageous situation. Having reason to believe
the enemy were not yet apprised of his coming, he re∣solved
to rush upon them in the night by surprise. With
this view, leaving his tents standing, with a sufficient
guard for the camp and waggons, he marched through
the woods towards the Cherokee town of Estaroe, at the
distance of five-and-twenty miles; and in his route de∣tached
a company of light infantry to destroy the village
of Little Keowee, where they were received with a smart
fire, but they rushed in with their bayonets, and all the
men were put to the sword. The main body proceeded
straight to Estatoe, which they reached in the morning,
but it had been abandoned about half an hour before
their arrival. Some few of the Indians, who had not time
to escape, were slain; and the town, consisting of two
hundred houses, well stored with provision, ammunition
and all the necessaries of life, was first plundered, and ther
reduced to ashes; some of the wretched inhabitants who
concealed themselves perishing in the flames. It was
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
necessary to strike a terror into those savages by some ex∣amples
of severity; and the soldiers became deaf to all the
suggestions of mercy, when they found in one of the In∣dian
towns the body of an Englishman, whom they had put
to the torture that very morning. Colonel Montgomery
followed his blow with surprising rapidity. In the space
of a few hours he destroyed Sugar-town, which was as
large as Estatoe, and every village and house in the Lower
Nation. The Indian villages in this part of the world
were agreeably situated, generally confisting of about one
hundred houses, neatly and commodiously built, and well
supplied with provision. They had in particular large
magazines of corn, which were consumed in the flames.
All the men that were taken suffered immediate death;
but the greater part of the nation had escaped with the
utmost precipitation. In many houses the beds were yet
warm, and the tables spread with victuals. Many loaded
guns went off while the houses were burning. The
savages had not time to save their most valuable effects.
The soldiers found some money, three or four watches, a
good quantity of wampum, clothes, and peltry. Colonel
Montgomery, having thus taken vegeance on the per∣sidious
Cherokees, at the expense of five or six men killed
or wounded, returned to Fort Prince George, with about
forty Indian women and children whom he had made pri∣soners.
Two of their warriors were set at liberty, and
desired to inform their nation, that, though they were
now in the power of the English, they might still, on their
submission, enjoy the blessing of peace. As the chief,
called Attakullakulla, alias the Little Carpenter, who had
signed the last treaty, disapproved of the proceedings of his
countrymen, and had done many good offices to the Eng∣lish
since the renovation of the war, he was now given to
understand, that he might come down with some other
chiefs to treat of an accommodation, which would be
granted to the Cherokees on his account; but that the
negociation must be begun in a few days, otherwise all the
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
towns in the Upper Nation would be ravaged, and re∣duced
to ashes.</P>
<P>§ XXII. These intimations having produced little or
no effect, Colonel Montgomery resolved to make a second
irruption into the middle settlements of the Cherokee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and began his march on the twenty-fourth day of June.
On the twenty-seventh Captain Morison, of the advanced
party, was killed by a shot from a thicket, and the firing
became so troublesome, that his men gave way. The
grenadiers and light-infantry being detached to sustain
them, continued to advance, notwithstanding the fire from
the woods, until, from a rising ground, they discovered
a body of the enemy. These they immediately attacked,
and obliged to retire into a swamp, which, when the rest
of the troops came up, they were, after a short resistance▪
compelled to abandon: but as the country was difficult,
and the path extremely narrow, the forces suffered on their
march from the fire of scattered parties, who concealed
themselves behind trees and bushes. At length they ar∣rived
at the town of Etchowee, which the inhabitants had
forsaken, after having removed every thing of value. Here,
while the army encamped on a small plain surrounded by
hills, it was incommoded by vollies from the enemy, which
wounded some men, and killed several horses. They were
even so daring as to attack the piqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t guard, which re∣pulsed
them with difficulty; but, generally speaking,
their parties declined an open engagement. Colonel
Montgomery, sensible that, as many horses were killed
or disabled, he could not proceed farther without leaving
his provisions behind, or abandoning the wounded men to
the brutal revenge of a savage enemy, resolved to return,
and began his retreat in the night, that he might be the
less disturbed by the Indians. Accordingly, he pursued
his route for two days without interruption; but after∣wards
sustained some stragging fires from the woods,
though the parties of the enemy were put to flight as often
as they appeared. In the beginning of July he arrived at
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
Fort Prince George; this expedition having cost him about
seventy men killed and wounded, including five officers.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. In revenge for these calamities, the Che∣rokees
assembled to a considerable number, and formed
the blockade of Fort Loudoun, a small fortification near
the confines of Virginia, defended by an inconsiderable
garrison, ill supplied with provision and necessaries. Af∣ter
having sustained a long siege, and being reduced to
the utmost distress, Captain Demere, the commander,
held a council of war with the other officers, to deliberate
upon their present situation; when it appeared that their
provisions were entirely exhausted; that they had subsisted
a considerable time, without bread, upon horse-flesh, and
such supplies of pork and beans as the Indian women could
introduce by stealth; that the men were so weakened with
famine and fatigue, that in a little time they would not be
able to do duty; that, for two nights past, considerable
parties had deserted, and some thrown themselves upon the
mercy of the enemy; that the garrison in general threat∣ened
to abandon their officers, and betake themselves to
the woods; and that there was no prospect of relief, their
communication having been long cut off from all the Bri∣tish
settlements: for these reasons they were unanimously
of opinion, that it was impracticable to prolong their de∣fence;
that they should accept of an honourable capi∣tulation;
and Captain Stuart should be sent to treat with
the warriors, and the head men of the Cherokees, about
the conditions of their surrender. This officer being ac∣cordingly
dispatched with full powers, obtained a capi∣tulation
of the Indians, by which the garrison was per∣mitted
to retire. The Indians desired, that when they
arrived at Keowee the Cherokee prisoners confined at that
place should be released, all hostilities cease, a lasting ac∣commodation
be re-established, and a regulated trade re∣vived.
In consequence of this treaty the garrison eva∣cuated
the sort, and had marched about fifteen miles on
their return to Carolina, when they were surrounded and
surprised by a large body of Indians, who massacred all
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
the officers, except Captain Stuart, and flew five-and-twenty
of the soldiers: the rest were made prisoners, and
distributed among the different towns and villages of the
nation. Captain Stuart owed his life to the generous
intercession of the Little Carpenter, who ransomed him
at the price of all he could command, and conducted him
safe to Holston River, where he found Major Lewi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ad∣vanced
so far with a body of Virginians. The savages,
encouraged by their success at Fort-Loudoun, undertook
the siege of Ninety-six, and other small fortification;
but retired precipitately on the approach of a body of
provincials.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. In the mean time, the British interest and em∣pire
were firmly established on the banks of the Ohio, by
the prudence and conduct of Major-General Stanwix,
who had passed the winter at Pittsburgh, formerly Du
Quesne, and employed that time in the most effectual man∣ner
for the service of his country. He repaired the old
works, established posts of communication from the Ohio
to the Monongahela, mounted the bastions that cover the
isthmus with artillery, erected casemates, store-houses, and
barracks for a numberous garrison, and cultivated with
equal diligence and success the friendship and alliance of
the Indians. The happy consequences of these measures
were soon apparent in the production of a considerable
trade between the natives and the merchants of Pittsburgh,
and in the perfect security of about four thousand settlers,
who now returned to the quiet possession of the lands
from whence they had been driven by the enemy on the
frontiers of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The incidents of the war were much more
important and decisive in the more northern parts of this
great continent. The reader will remember that Briga∣dier-General-Murray
was left to command the garrison of
Quebeck, amounting to about six thousand men; that a
strong squadron of ships was stationed at Hallifax, in No∣va-Scotia,
under the direction of Lord Colvil, an able and
experienced officer, who had instructions to revisit Quebeck
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>
in the beginning of summer, as soon as the river St. Lau∣rence
should be navigable; and that General Amherst,
the commander in chief of the forces in America, win∣tered
in New-York, that he might be at hand to assemble
his troops in the spring, and recommence his operations
for the entire reduction of Canada. General Murray ne∣glected
no step that could be taken by the most vigilant
officer for maintaining the important conquest of Quebeck,
and subduing all the Lower Canada, the inhabitants of
which actually submitted, and took the oath of allegiance
to the King of Great-Britain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The garrison of Quebeck, during the winter, reparied above five hun∣dred houses, which had been damaged by the English cannon, built eight redoubts of wood, raised foot-banks along the ramparts, opened embrasures, mounted arti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler), blocked up all the avenues of the subu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs with a stockade, removed eleven months provisions, into the highest part to the city, and formed a magazine of four thousand fascines. Two hundred men were posted at St. Foix, and twice the number at Lorette. Several hundred men marched to St. Augustin, brought off the enemy's advanced guard, with a great number of cattle, and disarmed the inhabitants. By these precautions the motions of the French were observed, the avenues of Quebeck were covered, and their dominion secured over eleven parishes, which furnished them with some fresh provision and other necessaries for subsistence. Sixteen thousand cords of wood being wanted for the hospitals, guards, and quarters, and the method of transporting it from the isle of Orleans being found slow and difficult, on account of the floating ice in the river, a sufficient number of hand sledges were made, and two hundred wood-sellers set at work in the forest of St. Foix, where plenty of fuel was obtained, and brought into the several regiments by the men that were not upon duty. A detachement or two hundred men, being sent to the other side of the river, disarmed the in∣habitants, and compelled them to take the oath of allegiance: by this step the English became masters of the southern side of the St. Laurence, and were supplied with good quantities of fresh provision. The advanced posts of the enemy were established at Point au Tremble, St. Augustin, and Le Cal∣vaire; the main body of their army quartered between Trois Rivieres, and Jaques Quartier. Their g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neral having formed the design of attacking Que∣beck in the winter, began to provide snow-shoes or rackets, scaling-ladders, and falcines, and make all the necessary preparations for that enterprise. He took possession of Point Levi, where he formed a magazine of provisions, great part of which, however, sell into the hands of the English; for, as soon as the river was froze over, Brigadier Murray dispatched thither two hundred men, at whose approach the enemy abandoned their magazine, and retreated with great precipitation. Here the detachment took post in a church, until they could build two wooden redoubts, and mount them with artillery. In the mean time, the enemy returning with a greater force to recover the post, some battaeliena, with the light infantry, marched over the ice, in order to cut off their communication; but they fled in great confusion, and after wards took post at St. Michael, at a considerable distance further down the river. They now resolved to postpone the siege of Quebeck, that they might carry it on in a more regular manner. They began to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig their ship, repair their small craft, build galleys, cast bombs and bullets, and prepare fasines and gabiona; while Brigadier Murray employed his men in making prepara∣tions for a vigorous defence. He sent out a detachment, who surprised the enemy's posts at St. Augustin, Maiton Brul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Le Calvaire, where they took ninety prisoners. He afterwards ordered the light infantry to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and fortify Cape Rouge, to prevent the enemy's landing at that place, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as to be nearer at hand to observe their motions; but when the first broke up, so that their ships could fall down the river, they landed at St. Augustin, and the English posts were abandoned one after another, the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tachments retiring without loss into the city.</NOTE>. The garrison, however,
<PB N="210" REF="215"/>
within the walls of Quebeck, suffered greatly from the ex∣cessive
cold in the winter, and the want of vegetables and
fresh provision, insomuch that, before the end of April,
one thousand soldiers were dead of the scurvy, and twice
that number rendered unfit for service. Such was the
situation of the garrison, when Mr. Murray received un∣doubted
intelligence that the French commander, the
Chevalier de Levis, was employed in assembling his army,
which had been cantoned in the neighbourhood of Mon∣treal;
that from the inhabitants of the country he had
completed his eight battalions, regimented forty companies
of the troops de Colonie, and determined to undertake the
siege of Quebeck, whenever the river St. Laurence should
be clear of ice, that he could use his four frigates, and
other vessels, by means of which he was entirely master
of the river.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The brigadier, considering the city of
Quebeck as no other than a strong cantonment, had pro∣jected
a plan of defence, by extending lines, and entrench∣ing
his troops on the heighths of Abraham, which, at the
distance of eight hundred paces, entirely command the
ramparts of the city, and might have been defended by a
small force against a formidable army. Fascines, and
every other necessary for this work, had been provided, and
in the month of April the men were set at work upon the
projected lines; but the earth was so hardened by the
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
frost, that it was found impracticable to proceed. Being
informed, on the night of the twenty-sixth, that the enemy
had landed at Point au Tremble, to the number of ten
thousand men, with five hundred savages, he ordered all
the bridges over the river Cagrouge to be broke down,
secured the landing places at Sylleri and the Foulon; and
next day, marching in person with a strong detachment
and two field-pieces, took possession of an advantageous
situation, and thus defeated the scheme which the French
commander had laid for cutting off the posts which the
English had established. These being all withdrawn, the
brigadier that same afternoon marched back to Quebeck,
with little or no loss, although his rear was harrassed by
the enemy. Here he formed a resolution which hath been
censured by some criticks in war, as a measure that sa∣voured
more of youthful impatience, and overboiling cou∣rage,
than of that military discretion which ought to
distinguish a commander in such a delicate situation; but
it is more easy to censure with an appearance of reason,
than to act in such circumstances with any certainty of
success. Mr. Murray, in his letter to the secretary of
state, declared, that although the enemy were greatly su∣perior
to him in number, yet, when he considered that the
English forces were habituated to victory, that they were
provided with a fine train of field artillery, that, in shutting
them up at once within the walls, he should have risked
his whole stake on the single chance of defending a
wretched fortification; a chance which could not be much
lessened by an action in the field, though such an action
would double the chance of success: for these reasons he
determined to hazard a battle; should the event prove
unprosperous, he resolved to hold out the place to the last
extremity; then to retreat to the isle of Orleans, or
Coudres, with the remainder of the garrison, and there
wait for a re-enforcement. In pursuance of these reso∣lutions
he gave the necessary orders over-night, and on the
twenty-eighth day of April, at half an hour after six in the
morning, marched out with his little army of three thou∣sand
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
men, which he formed on the heighths in order of
batle. The right brigade, commanded by Colonel Bur∣ton,
consisted of the regiments of Amherst, Anstruther,
Webb, and the second battalion of Royal Americans: the
left, under Colonel Fraser, was formed of the regiments of
Kennedy, Lascelles, Townshend, and the Highlanders.
Otway's regiment, and the third battalion of Royal Ame∣ricans,
constituted the corps de reserve. Major Dalling's
corps of light infantry covered the right flank; the left
was secured by Captain Huzzen's company of rangers,
and one hundred volunteers, under the command of Cap∣tain
Donald Macdonald; and each battalion was supplied
with two field-pieces. Brigadier Murray having recon∣noitred
the enemy, perceived their van had taken possession
of the rising grounds about three quarters of a mile in his
front; but that their army was on the march in one co∣lumn.
Thinking this was the critical moment to attack
them before they were formed, he advanced towards them
with equal order and expedition. They were soon driven
from the heighths, though not without a warm dispute,
during which the body of their army advanced at a round
pace, and formed in columns. Their van consisted of
ten companies of grenadiers, two of volunteers, and four
hundred savages: eight battalions, formed in four columns,
with some bodies of Canadians in the intervals, constituted
their main body: their rear was composed of two bat∣talions,
and some Canadians in the flanks; and two thou∣sand
Canadians formed the reserve. Their whole army
amounted to upwards of twelve thousand men. Major
Dalling, with great gallantry, dispossessed their grenadiers
of a house and wind mill which they occupied, in order to
cover their left flank; and in this attack the major and
some of his officers were wounded; nevertheless, the light
infantry pursued the fugitives to a corps which was formed
to sustain them; then pursuers halted, and dispersed
along the front of the right; a circumstance which pre∣vented
that wing from taking advantage of the first im∣pression
they had made on the left of the enemy. The
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
light infantry being ordered to regain the flank, were, in
attempting this motion, furiously charged, and thrown
into disorder: then they retired to the rear in such a
shattered condition, that they could never again be brought
up during the whole action. Otway's regiment was in∣stantly
ordered to advance from the body of reserve, and
sustain the right wing, which the enemy twice in vain
attempted to penetrate. Mean while the left brigade of
the British forces did not remain inactive: they had dis∣posssesed
the French of two redoubts, and sustained with
undaunted resolution the whole efforts of the enemy's
right, until they were fairly fought down, overpowered
by numbers, and reduced to a handful, notwithstanding
the assistance they received from the third battalion of
Royal Americans, which had been stationed with the body
of reserve, as well as from Kennedy's regiment, posted in
the centre. The French attacked with great impetu∣osity;
and, at length, a fresh column of the regiment
de Rousillon, penetrating the left wing of the British
army, it gave way; the disorder was soon communicated
to the right, so that, after a very obstinate dispute, which
lasted an hour and three quarters, Brigadier Murray was
obliged to quit the field, with the loss of one thousand
men killed or wounded, and the greater part of his artil∣lery.
The enemy lost twice the number of men, and
reaped no essential advantage from their victory.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. Mr. Murray, far from being dispirited by
his defeat, no sooner retired within the walls of Que∣beck,
than he resolved to prosceute the fortifications of
the place, which had been interrupted by the severity of
the winter; and the soldiers exerted themselves with
incredible alacrity, not only in labouring at the works,
but also in the defence of the town, before which the
enemy had opened trenches on the very evening of the
battle. Three ships anchored at the Foulon below their
camp; and for several days they were employed in land∣ing
their cannon, mortars, and ammunition. Mean
while they worked incessantly at their trenches before
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
the town; and on the eleventh day of May opened one
bomb battery, and three batteries of cannon. Brigadier
Murray made the necessary dispositions to defend the place
to the last extremity: he raised two cavaliers, contrived
some outworks, and planted the ramparts with one hun∣dred
and thirty-two pieces of artillery, dragged thither
mostly by the soldiery. Though the enemy cannonaded
the place with great vivacity the first day, their fire soon
slackened, and their batteries were, in a manner, silenced
by the superior fire of the garrison; nevertheless, Quebeck
would in all probability have reverted to its former own∣ers,
had a French fleet from Europe got the start of an
English squadron in sailing up the river.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Lord Colville had sailed from Hallifax,
with the fleet under his command, on the twenty-second
day of April; but was retarded in his passage by thick
fogs, contrary winds, and great shoals of ice floating
down the river. Commodore Swanton, who had sailed
from England with a small re-enforcement, arrived about
the beginning of May at the isle of Bec, in the river St.
Laurence, where, with two ships, he purposed to wait
for the rest of his squadron, which had separated from
him in the passage: but one of these, the Lowestoffe,
commanded by Captain Deane, had entered the harbour
of Quebeck on the ninth day of May, and communi∣cated
to the governor the joyful news that the squadron
was arrived in the river. Commodore Swanton no
sooner received intimation that Quebeck was besieged,
than he sailed up the river with all possible expedition,
and on the fifteenth in the evening anchored above Point
Levi. The brigadier expressing and earnest desire that
the French squadron above the town might be removed,
the Commodore ordered Captain Schomberg of the Diana,
and Captain Deane, of the Lowestoffe, to slip their cables
early next morning, and attack the enemy's fleet, con∣sisting
of two frigates, two armed ships, and a great
number of smaller vessels. They were no sooner in motion
than the French ships fled in the utmost disorder. One
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
of their frigates was driven on the rocks above Cape Dia∣monds;
the other ran ashore, and was burned at Point au
Tremble, above ten leagues about the town; and all
the other vessels were taken or destroyed.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The enemy were so confounded and dispirit∣ed
by this disaster, and the certain information that a
strong English fleet was already in the river St. Lau∣rence,
that in the following night they raised the siege of
Quebeck, and retreated with great precipitation, leaving
their provisions, implements, and artillery to Governor
Murray, who had intended to make a vigorous sally in
the morning, and attempt to penetrate into the camp of
the besiegers, which, from the information of prisoners
and deserters, he conceived to be a very practicable scheme.
For this purpose he had selected a body of troops, who
were already under arms, when a lieutenant, whom he
had sent out with a detachment to amuse the enemy,
came and assured his that their trenches were abandoned.
He instantly marched out of Quebeck at the head of his
forces, in hopes of overtaking and making an impression on
their rear, that he might have ample revenge for his late
discomfiture; but they had passed the river Caprouge be∣fore
he could come up with their army; however, he
took some prisoners, and a great quantity of baggage,
including their tents, stores, magazines of provision
and ammunition, with thirty-four pieces of battering can∣non,
ten field-pieces, six mortars, four petards, a great
number of scaling-ladders, entrenching tools, and every
other implement for a siege. They retired to Jacques-Quartier,
where their ammunition began to fail, and they
were abandoned by a great part of the Canadians; so that
they resigned all hope of succeeding against Quebeck, and
began to take measures for the preservation of Montreal,
against which the force under General Amherst was di∣rected.
There M. Vaudreuil had fixed his head-quarters,
and there he proposed to make his last stand against the
efforts of the British general. He not only levied forces,
collected magazines, and erected new fortifications in
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
the island of Montreal, but he had even recourse to
feigned intelligence, and other arts of delusion, to sup∣port
the spirits of the Canadians and their Indian allies,
which had begun to flag, in consequence of their being
obliged to abandon the siege of Quebeck. It must be
owned he acted with all the spirit and foresight of an ex∣perienced
general, determined to exert himself for the pre∣servation
of the colony, even though very little prospect
of success remained. His hopes, slender as they were,
depended upon the natural strength of the country, ren∣dered
almost inaccessible by woods, mountains, and mo∣rasses,
which might have retarded the progress of the
English, and protracted the war, until a general paci∣fication
could be effected. In the mean time, Major-General
Amherst was diligently employed in taking mea∣sures
for the execution of the plan he had projected, in
order to complete the conquest of Canada. He conveyed
instructions to General Murray, directing him to ad∣vance
by water towards Montreal, with all the troops
that could be spared from the garrison of Quebeck. He
detached Colonel Haviland, with a body of troops, from
Crown-point, to take possession of the Isle aux Noix, in
the lake Champlain, and from thence penetrate the short∣est
way to the bank of the river St. Laurence; while he
himself, with the main body of the army, amounting to
about ten thousand men, including Indians, should pro∣ceed
from the frontiers of New-York, by the rivers of
the Mohawks and Oneidas, to the lake Ontario, and sail
down the river St. Laurence to the island of Montreal.
Thus, on the supposition that all these particulars could
be executed, the enemy must have been hemmed in, and
entirely surrounded. In pursuance of this plan, General
Amherst had provided two armed sloops to cruise in the
lake Ontario, under the command of Captain Loring;
as well as a great number of batteux, or smaller vessels,
for the transportation of the troops, artillery, ammu∣nition,
implements, and baggage. Several regiments
were ordered to proceed from Albany to Oswego: and
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
the general, taking his departure from Schenectady,
with the rest of the forces, in the latter end of June,
arrived at the same place on the ninth day of July.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Being informed that two French vessels had
appeared off Oswego, he dispatched some batteaux to
Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gara, with intelligence to Captain Loring, who im∣mediately
set sail in quest of them; but they escaped his
pursuit, though they had twice appeared in the neigh∣bourhood
of Oswego since the arrival of the general, who
endeavoured to amuse them, by detaching batteaux to dif∣ferent
parts of the lake. The army being assembled, and
joined by a considerable body of Indians, under the com∣mand
of Sir William Johnson, the general detached
Colonel Haldimand, with the light infantry, the grena∣diers,
and one battalion of highlanders, to take post at
the bottom of the lake, and assist the armed vessels in
finding a passage to La Galette. On the tenth day of
August the army embarked on board the batteaux and
whale-boats, and proceeded on the lake towards the
mouth of the river St. Laurence. Understanding that
one of the enemy's vessels had run a-ground and was dis∣abled,
and that the other lay off La Galette, he resolved
to make the best of his way down the river to Swegatchie,
and attack the French fort at Isle Royale, one of the
most important posts on the river St. Laurence, the
source of which it in a great measure commands. On
the seventeenth the row-gallies fell in with the French
stoop commanded by M. de la Broquerie, who surrender∣ed
after a warm engagement. Mr. Amherst having de∣tached
some engineers to reconnoitre the coasts and islands
in the neighbourhood of Isle Royale, he made a disposition
for the attack of that fortress, which was accordingly
invested, after he had taken possession of the islands.
Some of these the enemy had abandoned with such preci∣pitation,
as to leave behind a few scalps they had taken
on the Mohawk river, a number of tools and utensils,
two swivels, some barrels of pitch, and a large quantity
of iron. The Indians were so incensed at sight of the
<PB N="218" REF="223"/>
scalps, that they burned a chapel, and all the houses of
the enemy. Batteries being raised on the nearest islands,
the fort was cannonaded not only by them, but likewise
by the armed sloops; and a disposition was made for
giving the assault, when M. Pouchaut, the governor,
thought proper to beat a parley, and surrender on capitu∣lation.
The general having taken possession of the
fort, found it so well situated for commanding the lake
Ontario, and the Mohawk river, that he resolved to
maintain it with a garrison, and employed some days in
repairing the fortifications.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. From this place his navigation down the
river St. Laurence was rendered extremely difficult and
dangerous, by a great number of violent riffs, or rapides,
and falls; among which he lost above fourscore men,
forty-six batteaux, seventeen whale-boats, one row-galley,
with some artillery, stores, and ammunition. On the sixth
day of September the troops were landed on the island
of Montreal, without any opposition, except from some
flying parties, which exchanged a few shot, and then fled
with precipitation. That same day he repaired a bridge
which they had broke down in their retreat, and, after
a march of two leagues, formed his army on a plain before
Montreal, where they lay all night on their arms. Mon∣treal
is, in point of importance, the second place in
Canada, situated in an island of the river St. Laurence,
at an equal distance from Quebeck and the lake Ontario.
Its central situation rendered it the staple of the Indian
trade; yet the fortifications of it were inconsiderable, not
at all adequate to the value of the place. General Am∣herst
ordered some pieces of artillery to be brought up
immediately from the landing-place at La Chine, where
he had left some regiments for the security of the boats,
and determined to commence the siege in form; but in
the morning of the seventh he received a letter from the
Marquis de Vaudr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uil by two officers, demanding a capitu∣lation;
which, after some letters had passed between the
two generals, was granted upon as favourable terms as
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
the French had reason to expect, considering that Gene∣ral
Murray, with the troops from Quebeck, had by this
time landed on the island; and Colonel Haviland, with
the body under his command, had just arrived on the
south-side of the river, opposite to Montreal: circum∣stances
equally favourable and surprising, if we reflect
upon the different routes they pursued, through an ene∣my's
country, where they had no intelligence of the mo∣tions
of each other. Had any accident retarded the pro∣gress
of General Amherst, the reduction of Montreal
would have been attempted by General Murray, who em∣barked
with his troops a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Quebeck on board of a great
number of small vessels, under the command of Captain
Deane, in the Diana. This gentleman, with uncommon
abilities, surmounted the difficulties of an unknown,
dangerous, and intricate navigation; and conducted the
voyage with such success, that not a single vessel was lost
in the expedition. M. de Levis, at the head of his
forces, watched the motions of General Murray, who,
in advancing up the river, published manifestoes among
the Canadians, which produced all the effect he could
desire. Almost all the parishes on the south shore, a far
as the river Sorrel, submitted, and took an oath of neu∣trality;
and Lord Rollo disarmed all the inhabitants of
the north shore, as far as Trois Rivieres, which, though
the capital of a district, being no more than an open
village, was taken without resistance. In a word, Gene∣ral
Amherst took possession of Montreal, and thus com∣pleted
the conquest of all Canada: a conquest the most
important of any that ever the British arms atchieved,
whether we consider the safety of the English colonies in
North-America, now secured from invasion and encroach∣ment:
the extent and fertility of the country subdued;
or the whole Indian commerce thus transferred to the
traders of Great-Britain. The terms of the capitulation
may perhaps be thought rather too favourable, as the
enemy were actually enclosed, and destitute of all hope
of relief: but little points like these ought always to be
<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
sacrificed to the consideration of great objects; and the
finishing the conquest of a great country without blood∣shed
redounds as much to the honour, as it argues the
humanity of General Amherst, whose conduct had been
irreproachable during the whole course of these American
operations. At the same time, it must be allowed he
was extremely fortunate in having subordinate command∣ers
who perfectly corresponded with his ideas, and a body
of troops whom no labours could discourage, whom no
dangers could dismay. Sir William Johnson, with a
power of authority and insinuation peculiar to himself,
not only maintained a surprising ascendancy over the most
ferocious of all the Indian tribes, but kept them within
the bounds of such salutary restraint, that not one single
act of inhumanity was perpetrated by them during the
whole course of this expedition. The zeal and conduct
of Brigadier-General Gage: the undaunted spirit and
enterprising genius of General Murray; the diligence
and activity of Colonel Haviland; happily co-operated in
promoting this great event.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The French ministry had attempted to suc∣cour
Montreal, by equipping a considerable number of
store-ships, and sending them out in the spring under con∣voy
of a frigate; but as their officers understood that the
British squadron had sailed up the river St. Laurence
before their arrival, they took shelter in the bay of Cha∣leurs,
on the coast of Acadia, where they did not long
remain unmolested. Captain Byron, who commanded
the ships of war that were left at Louisbourg, having re∣ceived
intelligence of them from Brigadier-General Whit∣more,
sailed thither with his squadron, and found them at
anchor. The whole fleet consisted of one frigate, two
large storeships, and nineteen sail of smaller vessels, the
greater part of which had been taken from the merchants
of Great-Britain: all these were destroyed, together
with two batteries which had been raised for their pro∣tection.
The French town, consisting of two hundred
houses, was demolished, and the settlement totally ruined.
<PB N="221" REF="226"/>
All the French subjects inhabiting the cerritories from the
bay of Fundy to the banks of the river St. Laurence, and
all the Indians through that tract of country, were now
subdued, and subjected to the English government. In
the month of December of the preceding year, the French
colonists of Miramichi, Rickebuctou, and other places
lying along the gulf of St. Laurence, made their submission
by deputies to Colonel Frye, who commanded in Fort
Cumberland at Chignecto. They afterwards renewed
this submission in the most formal manner, by subscribing
articles, by which they obliged themselves, and the people
they represented, to repair in the spring to Bay Verte,
with all their effects and shipping, to be disposed of ac∣cording
to the direction of Colonel Laurence, governour of
Hallifax, in Nova-Scotia. They were accompanied by
two Indian chiefs of the nation of the Mickmacks, a
powerful and numerous people, now become entirely de∣pendent
upon his Britannick Majesty. In a word, by the
conquest of Canada, the Indian fur-trade, in its full
extent, fell into the hands of the English. The
French interest among the savage tribes, inhabiting an
immense tract of country, was totally extinguished; and
their American possessions shrunk within the limits of
Louisiana, an infant colony on the south of the Missis∣sippi,
which the British arms may at any time easily
subdue.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. The conquest of Canada being atchieved,
nothing now remained to be done in North-America,
except the demolition of the fortifications of Louisbourg on
the island of Cape-Breton; for which purpose, some able
engineers had been sent from England with the ships com∣manded
by Captain Byron. By means of mines artfully
disposed and well constructed, the fortifications were re∣duced
to a heap of rubbish, the glacis was levelled, and the
ditches were filled. All the artillery, ammunition, and
implements of war, were conveyed to Hallifax; but the
barracks were repaired, so as to accommodate three hun∣dred
men occasionally; and the hospital, with the private
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
houses, were left standing. The French still possessed, upon
the continent of America, the fertile country lying on each
side of the great river Mississippi, which disembogues it self
into the gulf of Florida; but the colony was so thinly peo∣pled,
and so ill provided, that far from being formidable, it
scarce could have subsisted, unless the British traders had been
base and treacherous enough to supply it from time to time
with provisions and necessaries. The same infamous com∣merce
was carried on with divers French plantations in the
West-Indies; insomuch that the governours of provinces,
and commanders of the squadrons stationed in those seas,
made formal complaints of it to the ministry. The tempt∣ation
of extraordinary profit excited the merchants, not
only to assist the enemies of their country, but also to run
all risks in eluding the vigilance of the legislature. The
inhabitants of Martinique found a plentiful market of
provision furnished by the British subjects at the Dutch
islands of Eustatia and Curacoa; and those that were
settled on the island of Hispaniola were supplied in the
same manner at the Spanish settlement of Monte-Christo.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. While the British commanders exerted
themselves by sea and land with the most laudable spirit
of vigilance and courage against the foreign adversaries of
their country, the colonists of Jamaica ran the most im∣minent
hazard of being extirpated by a domestic enemy.
The negro-slaves of that island, grown insolent in the con∣templation
of their own formidable numbers, or by ob∣serving
the supine indolence of their masters, or stimulated
by that appetite for liberty so natural to the mind of man,
began, in the course of this year, to entertain thoughts of
shaking off the yoke by means of a general insurrection.
Assemblies were held, and plans revolved for this pur∣pose.
At length they concerted a scheme for rising in
arms all at once in different parts of the island, in order to
massacre all the white men, and take possession of the
government. They agreed that this design should be put
in execution immediately after the departure of the fleet for
Europe; but their plan was defeated by their ignorance
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
and impatience. Those of the conspirators that belonged
to Captain Forest's estate, being impelled by the fumes of
intoxication, fell suddenly upon the overseer, while he sat
at supper with some friends, and butchered the whole
company. Being immediately joined by some of their
confederates, they attacked the neighbouring plantations,
where they repeated the same barbarities, and seising all
the arms and ammunition that fell in their way, began to
grow formidable to the colony. The governour no sooner
received intimation of this disturbance, than he, by pro∣clamation,
subjected the colonists to martial law. All
other business was interrupted, and every man took to his
arms. The regular troops, joined by the troop of militia,
and a considerable number of volunteers, marched from
Spanish Town to St. Mary's, where the insurrection
began, and skirmished with the insurgents: but as they
declined standing any regular engagement, and trusted
chiefly to bush-fighting, the governour employed against
them the free blacks, commonly known by the name of
the Wild Negroes, now peaceably settled under the pro∣tection
of the government. These auxiliaries, in consider∣ation
of a price set upon the heads of the rebels, attacked
them in their own way, sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w them by surprise, until their
strength was broken, and numbers made away with them∣selves
in despair, so that the insurrection was supposed to
be quelled about the beginning of May; but in June it
broke out again with redoubled fury, and the rebels were
re-enforced to a very considerable number. The regular
troops and the militia, joined by a body of sailors, formed
a camp, under the command of Colonel Spragge, who
sent out detachments against the negroes, a great number of
whom were killed, and some taken; but the rest, instead
of submitting, took shelter in the woods and mountains.
The prisoners being tried, and found guilty of rebellion,
were put to death by a variety of tortures. Some were
hanged, some beheaded, some burned, and some fixed alive
upon gibbets. One of these last lived eight days and
eighteen hours, suspended under a vertical sun, without
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
being refreshed by one drop of water, or receiving any
manner of sustenance. In order to prevent such insur∣rections
for the future, the justices assembled at the sessis
of the peace established regulations, importing, that no
negro-slave should be allowed to quit his plantation with∣out
a white conductor, or a ticket of leave; that every
negro playing at any sort of game should be scourged
through the publick streets; that every publican suffering
such gaming in his house should forfeit forty shillings;
that every proprietor suffering his negro to beat a drum,
blow a horn, or make any other noise in his plantation,
should be fined ten pounds; and every overseer allow∣ing
these irregularities should pay half that sum, to be
demanded, or distrained for, by any civil or military
officer; that every free negro, or mulatto, should wear a
blue cross on his right shoulder, on pain of imprisonment;
that no mulatto, Indian, or negro, should hawk or s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il
any thing, except fresh fish and milk, on pain of being
scourged; that rum and punch houses should be shut up
during divine service on Sundays, under the penalty of
twenty shillings; and that those who had petit licenses
should shut up their houses on other nights at nine
o'clock.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. Notwithstanding these examples and re∣gulations,
a body of rebellious negroes still subsisted in
places that were deemed inaccessible to regular forces,
and from these they made nocturnal irruptions into the
nearest plantations, where they acted with all the wanton∣ness
of barbarity; so that the people of Jamaica were
obliged to conduct themselves with the utmost vigilance
and circumspection; while Rear-Admiral Holmes, who
commanded at sea, took every precaution to secure the
island from insult or invasion. He not only took mea∣sures
for the defence of Jamaica, but also contrived and
executed schem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for annoying the enemy. Having, in
the month of October, received intelligence that five
French srigates were equipped at Cape Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ois, on the
island of Hispaniola, in order to convoy a fleet of merchant
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
ships to Europe, he stationed the ships under his com∣mand
in such a manner as was most likely to intercept this
fleet; and his disposition was attended with success. The
enemy sailed from the Cape to the number of eight sail on
the sixteenth, and next day they were chased by the King's
ships the Hampshire, Lively, and Boreas, which, how∣ever,
made small progress, as there was little wind, and
that variable. In the evening, the breeze freshened, and
about midnight the Boreas came up with the Sirenne, com∣manded
by Commodore M`Cartie. They engaged
with great vivacity for about twenty-five minutes, when
the Sirenne shot a-head, and made the best of her way.
The Boreas was so damaged in her rigging, that she could
not close with the enemy again till next day, at two in the
afternoon, when the action was renewed off the east end of
Cuba, and maintained till forty minutes past four, when
Mr. M`Cartie struck. In the mean time, the Hamp∣shire
and Lively gave chace to the other four French
frigates, which steered to the southward with all the sail
they could carry, in order to reach the west end of Tor∣tuga,
and shelter themselves in Port au Prince. On the
eighteenth the Lively, by the help of her oars, came up
with the Valeur, at half an hour past seven in the morn∣ing;
and after a hot action, which continued an hour and
a half, compelled the enemy to submit. The Hampshire
stood after the other three, and, about four in the after∣noon,
ran up between the Duke de Choiseul and the
Prince Edward. These she engaged at the same time;
but the first, having the advantage of the wind, made her
retreat into Port au Paix; the other ran ashore about two
leagues to leeward, and struck her colours, but at the ap∣proach
of the Hampshire the enemy set her on fire, and
she blew up. This was also the fate of the Fleur de Lys,
which had run into Fresh-Water-Bay, a little farther to lee∣ward
of Port au Prince. Thus, by the prudent disposition
of Admiral Holmes, and the gallantry of his three cap∣tains,
Norbury, Uvedale, and Maitland, two large frigates
of the enemy were taken, and three destroyed. The spirit
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
of the officers was happily supported by an uncommon
exertion of courage in the men, who chearfully engaged
in the most dangerous enterprises. Immediately after the
capture of the French frigates, eight of the enemy's pri∣vateers
were destroyed or brought into Jamaica. Two of
these, namely the Vainqueur of ten guns, sixteen swivels,
and ninety men, and the Mackau of six swivels and fifteen
men, had run into shoal water in Cumberland harbour, on
the island of Cuba. The boats of the Trent and Boreas,
manned, under the direction of the Lieutenants Millar
and Stuart, being rowed up to the Vainqueur, boarded
and took possession under a close fire, after having sur∣mounted
many other difficulties. The Mackau was taken
without any resistance; then the boats proceeded against
the Guespe, of eight guns, and eighty-five men, which lay
at anchor farther up in the Lagoon; but before they came
up the enemy had set her on fire, and she was destroyed.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The same activity and resolution di∣stinguished
the captains and officers belonging to the
squadron commanded by Sir James Douglas off the Lee∣ward
Island. In the month of September, the Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
O'Brien and Taylor, of the ships Temple and Griffin, be∣ing
on a joint cruise off the islands Granadas, received
intelligence that the Virgin, formerly a British sloop of
war, which had been taken by the enemy, then lay at
anchor, together with three privateers, under protection
of three forts on the island, sailed thither in order to attack
them, and their enterprise was crowned with success.
After a warm engagement, which lasted several hours, the
enemy's batteries were silenced, and indeed demolished,
and the English captains took possession of the four prizes.
They afterwards entered another harbour of that island,
having first demolished another sort; and there they lay
four days unmolested, at the expiration of which they
carried off three other prizes. In their return to Antigua,
they fell in with thirteen ships bound to Martinique with
provisions, and took them all without resistance. About
the same time, eight or nine privateers were taken by the
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
ships which Commodore Sir James Douglas employed in
cruising round the island of Guadaloupe, so that the
British commerce in those seas flourished under his care
and protection.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. In the East-Indies the British arms still
continued to prosper. After the reduction of Arcot, the
garrisons of Permacoil and Allumparva surrendered them∣selves
prisoners of war in the beginning of May. The
Falmouth obliged the Haarlem, a French ship from Mer∣guy,
to run ashore to the northward of Pondicherry. The
important settlement of Carical was reduced by the sea
and land forces commanded by Rear-Admiral Cornish
and Major Monson, and the French garrison made pri∣soners
of war; and Colonel Coote formed the blockade
of Pondicherry by land, while the harbour was beset by
the English squadron.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. No action of importance was in the
course of this year atchieved by the naval force of Great-Britain
in the seas of Europe. A powerful squadron still
remained in the bay of Quiberon, in order to amuse and
employ a body of French forces on that part of the coast,
and interrupt the navigation of the enemy; though the
principal aim of this armament seems to have been to
watch and detain the few French ships which had run into
the river Villaine, after the defeat of Constans, an object
the importance of which will doubtless astonish posterity.
The fleet employed on this service was alternately com∣manded
by Admiral Boscawen and Sir Edward Hawke,
officers of distinguished abilities, whose talents might have
been surely rendered subservient to much greater national
advantages. All that Mr. Boscawen could do in this
circumscribed scene of action was to take possession of a
small island near the river Vannes, which he caused to be
cultivated, and planted with vegetables, for the use of the
men infected with scorbutick disorders arising from salt
provision, sea air, and want of proper exercise. In the
month of September, Sir Edward Hawke, who had by
this time relieved Mr. Boscawen, detached the gallant
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
Lord Howe, in the Magnanime, with the ships Prince
Frederick and Bedford, to reduce the little island of Du∣met,
about three miles in length, and two in breadth,
abounding with fresh water. It was defended by a small
fort, mounted with nine cannon, and manned with one
company of the regiment of Bourbon, who surrendered
in a very short time after the ships had begun the attack.
By this small conquest a considerable expense was saved
to the nation in the article of transports employed to
carry water for the use of the squadron.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. Admiral Rodney still maintained his for∣mer
station off the coast of Havre de Grace, to observe
what should pass at the mouth of the Seine. In the
month of July, while he hovered in this neighbourhood,
five large flat-bottomed boats, laden with cannon and
shot, set sail from Harfleur in the middle of the day, with
their colours flying, as if they had set the English squadron
at defiance, for the walls of Havre de Grace, and even
the adjacent hills, were covered with spectators, assembled
to behold the issue of this adventure. Having reached the
river of Caen, they stood backwards and forwards upon
the shoals, intending to amuse Admiral Rodney till night,
and then proceed under cover of the darkness. He per∣ceived
their drift, and gave directions to his small vessels to
be ready, that as soon as day-light failed they should make
all the sail they could for the mouth of the river Orn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in
order to cut off the enemy's retreat, while he himself stood
with the larger ships to the steep coast of Port Bassin. The
scheme succeeded to his wish. The enemy, seeing their
retreat cut off, ran ashore at Port Bassin, where the Ad∣miral
destroyed them, together with the small fort which
had been erected for the defence of this harbour. Each of
those vessels was one hundred feet in length, and capable of
containing four hundred men for a short passage. What
their destination was we cannot pretend to determine; but
the French had provided a great number of these trans∣ports;
for ten escaped into the river Orne leading to
Caen; and in consequence of this disaster on hundred
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
were unloaded, and sent up again to Rouen. This was
not all the damage that the enemy sustained on this part
of the coast. In the month of November, Captain Ourry,
of the Acteon, chased a large privateer, and drove her
ashore between Cape Barfleur and La Hogue, where she
perished. The cutters belonging to Admiral Rodney's
squadron scoured the coast towards Dieppe, where a con∣siderable
fishery was carried on, and where they took or
destroyed near forty vessels of considerable burthen.
Though the English navy suffered nothing from the
French during this period, it sustained some damage from
the weather. The Conqueror, a new ship of the line,
was lost in the channel, on the island of St. Nicholas, but
the crew and cannon were saved. The Lyme, of twenty
guns, foundered in the Cattegat, in Norway, and fifty of
the men perished; and, in the West-Indies, a tender be∣longing
to the Dublin, commanded by Commodore Sir
James Douglas, was lost in a gale of wind, with an hun∣dred
chosen mariners.</P>
<P>§ XL. Of the domestick transactions relating to the
war, the most considerable was the equipment of a pow∣erful
armament destined for some secret expedition. A
numerous body of forces was assembled, and a great num∣ber
of transports collected at Portsmouth. Generals were
nominated to the command of this enterprise. The troops
were actually embarked with a great train of artillery;
and the eyes of the whole nation were attentively fixed
upon this armament, which could not have been prepared
without incurring a prodigious expense. Notwithstand∣ing
these preparations, the whole summer was spent in
idleness and inaction; and in the latter end of the season
the undertaking was laid aside. The people did not fail to
clamour against the inactivity of the summer, and com∣plain,
that, notwithstanding the immense subsidies granted
for the prosecution of the war, no stroke of importance
was struck in Europe for the advantage of Great-Britain;
but that her treasure was lavished upon fruitless parade,
or a German alliance, still more pernicious. It must be
<PB N="230" REF="235"/>
owned, indeed, that no new attempt was made to annoy the
enemy on British principles, for the surrender of Montreal
was the natural consequence of the steps which had been
taken, and of the measures concerted in the course of the
preceding year. It will be allowed, we apprehend, that
the expense incurred by the armament at Portsmouth, and
the body of troops there detained, would have been suffi∣cient,
if properly applied, to reduce the island of Mau∣ritius
in the Indian ocean, Martinique in the West-Indies,
or Minorca in the Mediterranean, and all these
three were objects of importance. In all probability, the
design of the armament was either to intimidate the French
into proposals of peace, to make a diversion from the
Rhine, by alarming the coast of Bretagne, or to throw over
a body of troops into Flanders, to effect a junction with the
Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, who, at the head of
twenty thousand men, had made an irruption as far as the
Lower Rhine, and even crossed that river; but he mis∣carried
in the execution of his design.</P>
<P>§ XLI. In the midst of these alarms some regard was
paid to the improvements of natural knowledge. The
Royal Society having made application to the King, re∣presenting
that there would be a transit of Venus over the
disk of the sun, on the sixth day of June, and that there
was reason to hope the parallax of that planet might be
more accurately determined, by making proper observa∣tions
of this phaenomenon at the island of St. Helena,
near the coast of Africa, and at Bencool<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, in the East-Indies,
his Majesty granted a sum of money to defray the
expense of sending able astronomers to those two places,
and ordered a ship of war to be equipped for their convey∣ance.
Accordingly, Mr. Nevil Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kelyne and Mr. Ro∣bert
Waddington were appointed to make the observations
at St. Helena; and Mr. Charles Mason and Mr. J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣miah
Dixon undertook the voyage to Bencoolen, on the
island of Sumatra<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of April, the King granted to his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Edward Augustus, and to the heirs male of his Royal Highnes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of duke of the kingdom of Great-Britain, and of Earl of the kingdom of Ireland, by the names, stiles, and titles of Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ulster.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="236"/>
§ XLII. Except the countries that were actually the
scenes of war, no political revolution or disturbance dis∣quieted
the general tranquillity. Syria, indeed, felt all the
horrours and wreck of a dreadful earthquake, protracted
in repeated shocks, which began on the thirtieth day of
October, in the neighbourhood of Tripoli. A great
number of houses were overthrown at Seyde, and many
people buried under the ruins. It was felt through a space
of ten thousand square leagues, comprehending the moun∣tains
of Libanus and Antilibanus, with an infinite num∣ber
of villages, that were reduced to heaps of rubbish. At
Acra, or Ptolemais, the sea overflowed its banks, and
poured into the streets, though eight feet above the level
of the water. The city of Saphet was entirely destroyed,
and the greatest part of its inhabitants perished. At
Damascus all the minorets were overthrown, and six thou∣sand
people lost their lives. The shocks diminished
gradually till the twenty-fifth day of November, when
they were renewed with redoubled havock; the earth
trembled with the most dreadful convulsions, and the
greater part of Tripoli was destroyed. Balbeck was en∣tirely
ruined; and this was the fate of many other towns
and castles; so that the people who escaped the ruins
were obliged to sojourn in the open fields, and all Syria
was threatened with the vengeance of heaven. Such a
dangerous ferment arose at Conftantinople, that a revo∣lution
was apprehended. Mustapha, the present Empe∣rour,
had no sons; but his brother Bajazet, whose life
he had spared, contrary to the maxims of Turkish policy,
produced a son by one of the women with whom he was
indulged in his consinement; a circumstance which
aroused the jealousy of the Emperour to such a degree, that
he resolved to dispatch his brother. The great officers of
the Porte opposed this design, which was so disagreeable
to the people, that an insurrection ensued. Several Turks
<PB N="232" REF="237"/>
and Armenians, taking it for granted that a revolution
was at hand, bought up great quantities of grain; and
a dreadful dearth was the consequence of this monopoly.
The Sultan assembled the troops, quieted the insurgents,
ordered the engrossers of corn to be executed, and in a
little time the repose of the city was re-established.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Notwithstanding the prospect of a rupture in
Italy, no new incident interrupted the tranquillity which
the southern parts of Europe enjoyed. The King of
Spain, howsoever sollicited by the other branch of the
House of Bourbon to engage in the war, as its ally,
refused to interpose in any other way, than as a mediator
between the courts of London and Versailles. He sent
the Conde de Fuentes, a nobleman of high rank and
character, in quality of ambassador extraordinary to the
King of Great-Britain, in order to offer his good offices
for effecting a peace; and the Conde, after having con∣ferred
with the English ministry, made an excursion to
Paris; but his proposal with respect to a cessation of hosti∣lities,
if in reality such a proposal was ever made, did
not meet with a cordial reception. Other differences
subsisting between the crowns of Great-Britain and Spain
he found no difficulty in compromising. His Catholick
Majesty persisted in the execution of a plan truely worthy
of a patriot king. In the first place, he spared no pains
and application to make himself thoroughly acquainted
with the state of his kingdom. He remitted to his people
all they owed the crown, amounting to three score mil∣lions
of reals: he demanded an exact account of his fa∣ther's
debts, that they might be discharged with the ut∣most
punctuality: an order was sent to the treasury,
that ten millions of reals should be annually appropriated
for this purpose, until the whole should be liquidated;
and, to the first year's payment, he added fifty millions,
to be divided equally among the legal claimants. He
took measures for the vigorous execution of the laws
against offenders; encouraged industry; protected com∣merce;
and felt the exquisite pleasure of being beloved as
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
the father of his people. To give importance to his
crown, and extend his influence among the powers of
Europe, he equipped a powerful squadron of ships at
Carthagena, and is said to have declared his intention to
employ them against Algiers, should the Dey refuse to
release the slaves of the Spanish nation.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. Portugal seemed still agitated from the shock
of the late conspiracy which was quelled in that king∣dom.
The Pope's nuncio was not only forbid the court,
but even sent under a strong guard to the frontiers: an in∣dignity
which induced the pontiff to order the Portuguese
minister at Rome to evacuate the ecclesiastical dominions.
In the mean time, another embarkation of Jesuits was
sent from Lisbon to Civita Vecchia; yet the expulsion
of these fathers did not restore the internal peace of Portu∣gal,
or put an end to the practice of plotting: for, even
since their departure, some persons of rank have been
either committed to close prison, or exiled from the king∣dom.
The Jesuits were not more fortunate in America;
for in the month of October, in the foregoing year, an
obstinate battle was fought between the united forces of
Spain and Portugal, and the Indians of Paraguay,
who were under the dominion of the Jesuits: victory at
length declared in favour of the two crowns: so that the
vanquished were obliged to capitulate, and lay down
their arms. As the court of Portugal had made remon∣strances
to the British ministry against the proceedings of
the English squadron under Admiral Boscawen, which
had attacked and destroyed some French ships under the
Portuguese fort in the bay of Lagos, his Britannick
Majesty thought proper to send the Earl of Kinnoul, as
ambassador extraordinary to Lisbon, where that noble∣man
made such excuses for the insult of the English ad∣miral,
as entirely removed all misunderstanding between
the two crowns; and could not fail of being agreeable to
the Portuguese monarch, thus respected, soothed, and depre∣cated
by a mighty nation, in the very zenith of power and
prosperity. On the sixth of June, being the birth-day of
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
the King of Portugal, the marriage of his brother, Don
Pedro, with the Princess of Brazil, was celebrated in
the chapel of the palace where the King resides, to the
universal joy of the people. The nuptials were announced
to the publick by the discharge of cannon, and celebrated
with illuminations, and all kinds of rejoicing.</P>
<P>§ XLV. An accident, which happened in the Medi∣terranean,
had like to have drawn the indignation of the
Ottoman Porte on the knights of the order of Malta. A
large Turkish ship of the line, mounted with sixty-eight
brass cannon, having on board a complement of seven
hundred men, besides seventy Christian slaves, under the
immediate command of the Turkish admiral, had, in
company with two frigates, five gallies, and other smaller
vessels, sailed in June from the Dardanelles, cruised along
the coasts of Smyrna, Scio, and Trio, and at length
anchored in the channel of Stangie, where the admiral
with four hundred persons, went on shore, on the nine∣teenth
day of September: the Christian slaves, seising this
opportunity, armed themselves with knives, and fell upon
the three hundred that remained with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch sury and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that a great number of the Turks were instantly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
many leaped overboard into the sea, where they p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rished
and the rest sued for mercy. The Christians, havingG
thus secured possession of the ship, hoisted sail, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
away for Malta; which, though chased by the two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
gates, and a Ragusan ship, they reached, by crouding a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their canvas, and brought their prize sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into the har∣bour
of Valette, amidst the acclamations of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
The order of Malta, as a recompense for this signal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of bravery and resolution, assigned to the captors the
whole property of the ship and slaves, together with al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the effects on board, including a sum of money, which
the Turkish commander had collected by contribution
amounting to a million and a half of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lorins. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Signor was so enraged at this event, that he disgraced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
admiral, and threatened to take vengeance on the ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
<PB N="235" REF="240"/>
Malta, for having detained the ship, and countenanced
the capture.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. With respect to the disputes which had so
long embroiled the northern parts of Europe, the neu∣tral
powers seemed as averse as ever to a participation.
The King of Denmark continued to perfect those plans
which he had wisely formed for increasing the wealth,
and promoting the happiness of his subjects; nor did he
neglect any opportunity of improving natural knowledge,
for the benefit of mankind in general. He employed
men of ability, at his own expense, to travel into foreign
countries, and to collect the most curious productions, for
the advancement of natural history: he encouraged the
liberal and mechanick arts at home, by munificent re∣wards
and peculiar protection: he invited above a thou∣sand
foreigners from Germany to become his subjects,
and settle in certain districts of Jutland, which had lain
waste above three centuries; and they forthwith began to
build villages, and cultivate the lands in the dioceses of
Wibourg, Arhous, and Ripen. Their travelling expenses
from Altena to their new settlement were defrayed by the
King, who, moreover, maintained them until the pro∣duce
of the lands could afford a comfortable subsistence.
He likewise bestowed upon each colonist a house, a barn,
and a stable, with a certain number of horses and cattle.
Finally, this generous patriot having visited these new
subjects, who received him with unspeakable emotions of
joy and affection, he ordered a considerable sum of money
to be distributed among them, as an additional mark of
his favour. Such conduct in a prince cannot fail to secure
the warmest returns of loyalty and attachment in his
people; and the execution of such laudable schemes will
endear his name to the contemplation of posterity.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. The Dutch, as usual, persevered in prose∣cuting
every branch of commerce, without being diverted
to less profitable schemes of state policy by the insinu∣ations
of France or the remonstrances of Great-Britain.
The violation of the peace by their subjects in Bengal
<PB N="236" REF="241"/>
was no sooner known at the court of London, than orders
were sent to General Yorke, the English ambassador at
the Hague, to demand an explanation. He, accord∣ingly,
presented a memorial to the States-General, signi∣fying,
that their High Mightinesses must, doubtless, be
greatly astonished to hear, by the publick papers, of the
irregularities committed by their subjects in the East-Indies;
but that they would be much more amazed on
perusing the piece annexed to his memorial, containing a
minute account, specified with the strictest regard to truth,
of the irregular conduct observed by the Dutch towards
the British subjects in the river of Bengal, at a time when
the factors and traders of Holland enjoyed all the sweets
of peace, and all the advantages of unmolested commerce;
at a time when his Britannick Majesty, from his great
regard to their High Mightinesses, carefully avoided
giving the least umbrage to the subjects of the United
Provinces. He observed, that the King his sovereign
was deeply affected by these outrageous doings and mis∣chievous
designs of the Dutch in the East-Indies, whose
aim was to destroy the British settlements in that coun∣try;
an aim that would have been accomplished, had
not the King's victorious arms brought them to reason,
and obliged them to sue for an accommodation. He told
them his Majesty would willingly believe their High
Mightinesses had given no order for proceeding to such ex∣tremities,
and that the directors of their India company
had no share in the transaction: nevertheless, he (the
ambassador) was ordered to demand signal satisfaction,
in the name of the King his master; that all who should
be found to have shared in the offence so manifestly tending
to the destruction of the English settlements in that coun∣try
should be exemplarily punished; and that their High
Mightinesses should confirm the stipulations agreed upon
immediately after the action by the directors of the
respective companies, in consideration of which agree∣ment
the Dutch ships were restored, after their com∣manders
acknowledged their fault, in owning themselves
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
the aggressors. To this remonstrance the States-Gene∣ral
replied, that nothing of what was laid to the charge of
their subjects had yet reached their knowledge; but they
requested his Britannick Majesty to suspend his judge∣ment,
until he should be made perfectly acquainted
with the grounds of those disputes; and they promised
he should have reason to be satisfied with the exemplary

<P>§ XLVIII. The war in Germany still raged with unre∣lenting
fury, and the mutual rancour of the contending par∣ties
seemed to derive fresh force from their mutual disappoint∣ments;
at least, the house of Austria seemed still implacable,
and obstinately bent upon terminating the war with the
destruction of the Prussian monarch. Her allies, however,
seemed less actuated by the spirit of revenge. The French
King had sustained so much damage and disgrace in the
course of the war, that his resources failed, and his
finances fell into disorder; he could no longer afford the
subsidies he had promised to different powers; while his
subjects clamoured aloud at the burthen of impositions,
the ruin of trade, and the repeated dishonour entailed
upon the arms of France. The Czarina's zeal for the
alliance was evidently cooled by the irregular and defective
payments of the subsidies she had stipulated. Perhaps
she was disappointed in her hope of conquest, and cha∣grined
to see her armies retire from Germany at the ap∣proach
of every winter; and the British ministry did
not fail to exert all their influence to detach her from the
confederacy in which she had embarked. Sweden still
languished in an ineffectual parade of hostilities against
the house of Brandenburgh; but the French interest began
to lose ground in the diet of that kingdom. The King
<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
of Prussia, howsoever exhausted in the article of men,
betrayed no symptom of apprehension, and made no
advance towards a pacification with his adversaries. He
had employed the winter in recruiting his armies by
every expedient his fertile genius could devise; in levy∣ing
contributions to re-enforce the vast subsidy he re∣ceived
from England, in filling magazines, and making
every preparation for a vigorous campaign. In West∣phalia,
the same foresight and activity were exerted by
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, who in the beginning
of summer found himself at the head of a very numerous
army, paid by Great-Britain, and strengthened by two-and-twenty
thousand national troops.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. No alteration in the terms of this alliance
was produced by the death of William Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel, who breathed his last, in an advanced age,
on the twenty-eighth day of January, at Rintelen upon
the Weser. He was succeeded in the landgraviate by his
son Frederick, whose consort, the Princess Mary, daugh∣ter
to the King of Great-Britain, now, in quality of
governess of her children, assumed the regency and admi∣nistration
of the county of Hanau-Mutzenberg, by virtue
of the settlement made in the life time of her father-in
law, and confirmed by her husband. She had for som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
years been separated from him, and resided with his fa¦ther,
at whose decease she retired, with her children, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the city of Zell. The present landgrave, who lived a
Magdebourg, as vice-governour under the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prussia, no sooner learned the news of his father's death
than he sent an intimation of it to that prince and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King of Great-Britain, declaring, at the same time
that he would scrupulously adhere to the engagement
of his predecessor.</P>
<P>§ L. The advances towards a peace, which had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made in the preceding year by the Kings of England an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prussia, in their declaration published at the Hague <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Prince Louis of Brunswick, seemed to infuse in neutr
powers a good opinion of their moderation. We ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="239" REF="244"/>
already seen that the King of Spain offered his best offices
in quality of mediator. When a congress was proposed,
the States-General made an offer of Breda, as a place
proper for the negociation. The King of Great-Britain,
by the mouth of his ambassador, thanked their High Mighti∣nesses
for the sincere desire they expressed to put an end to
the ravages of war, which had extended desolation over
the face of Europe: he readily closed with their gracious
offer, and in consequence of his high regard and invari∣able
friendship for their High Mightinesses, wished earn∣estly
that it might be acceptable to the other powers at
war. The French King expressed his sentiments nearly
to the same purpose. His ambassador declared, That
his Most Christian Majesty was highly sensible of the
offer they had made of Breda for holding the congress;
that, in order to give a fresh proof of his sincere desire to
increase the good harmony that subsisted between him and
the States-General, he accepted their offer with pleasure;
but as he could take no step without the concurrence of
his high allies, he was obliged to wait for their answer,
which could not fail to be favourable, if nothing remained
to be settled but the place for holding the congress.
King Stanislaus having written a letter to his Britannick
Majesty, offering the city of Nancy for the same purpose,
he received a civil answer, expressing the King of Eng∣land's
sense of his obliging offer, which, however, he
declined, as a place not conveniently situated for all the
powers interested in the great work of pacification. Civil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties
of the same nature likewise passed between the sover∣eign
of Nancy and the King of Prussia. As the proposals
for an accommodation made by the King of England
and his allies might have left an unfavourable impression
of their adversaries had they been altogether declined,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he court of Vienna was prevailed upon to concur with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er allies in a declaration professing their desire of peace,
which declaration was delivered, on the third day of
April, by the Austrian minister residing at the Hague,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Serene Highness Prince Louis of Brunswick; and a
<PB N="240" REF="245"/>

by the French and Russian ministers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A translation of the declaration delivered by the</HI> Austrian <HI>minister <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the</HI> Hague <HI>to his Serene Highness</HI> Prince Louis <HI>of</HI> Brunswick, <HI>in answer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that which his Highness had delivered on the parts of his</HI> Britannick Majesty <HI>and the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Prussia, <HI>on the</HI> 25<HI>th of</HI> November 1759, <HI>to the ministers of the belligerent powers:</HI>

These
professions, however, did not interrupt the operations of
the campaign.</P>
<P>§ LI. Though the French army under the Mareschal
Duke de Broglio remained in cantonment in the neigh∣bourhood
of Friedberg, and Prince Ferdinand had retired
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
from Corsdorff to Marpurg, where in the beginning of
January he established his head-quarters, nevertheless, the
winter was by no means inactive. As far back as the
twenty-fifth day of December the Duke de Broglio, having
called in his detachments, attempted to surprise the allied
army by a forced march to Klein-linnes; but finding them
prepared to give him a warm reception, nothing but a can∣nonade
ensued, and he retreated to his former quarters.
On the twenty-ninth Colonel Luckner, at the head of the
Hanoverian hunters, fell in with a detachment of the
enemy, consisting of four hundred men, under the com∣mand
of Count Muret. These he attacked with such
vigour, that the count was made prisoner, and all his par∣ty
either killed or taken, except two-and-twenty, who
escaped. On the third day of January the Marquis de
Vogue attacked the town of Herborn, which he carried,
and took a small detachment of the allies, who were posted
there. At the same time the Marquis Dauvet made him∣self
master of Dillembourg, the garrison of the allied
troops being obliged to retire into the castle, where they
were closely besieged Prince Ferdinand no sooner under∣stood
their situation than he began his march with a strong
detachment for their relief, on the seventh day of the
month, when he attacked and totally defeated the be∣siegers,
took seven hundred prisoners, including forty
officers, with seven pair of colours, and two pieces of can∣non.
On that very day the Highlanders, under Major
Keith, supported by the hussars of Luckner, who com∣manded
the whole detachment, attacked the village of
Eybach, where Beaufremont's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of dragoons was
posted on the side of Dillembourg, and routed them with
great slaughter. The greater part of the regiment was
killed, and many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were taken, together with
two hundred horses, and all their baggage. The High∣landers
distinguished themselves on this occasion by their
intrepidity, which was the more remarkable, as they were
no other than raw recruits, just arrived from their own
country, and altogether unacquainted with discipline. On
<PB N="242" REF="247"/>
the eighth day of January M. de St. Germain advanced
on the left of the allies, with the grenadiers of the French
army, supported by eight battalions, and a body of dra∣goons:
but he was encountered by the Duke of Holstein,
at the head of a strong detachment, in the neighbourhood
of Ersdorff, who, by dint of a furious cannonade, obliged
him to retreat with precipitation. After this attempt the
French parties disappeared, and their army retired into
winter-quarters, in and about Franckfort on the Maine;
while Prince Ferdinand quartered the allies at Cassel, Pa∣derborn,
Munster, and Osnabruck, this last place being
allotted to the British toops, as being the nearest to Emb∣den,
where the re-enforcements from Britain were to be
landed. In the beginning of February, the Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick, with the detachment of the allied
army under his command, began his march from Chem∣nitz,
in Saxony, for Westphalia, where he safely arrived,
after having assisted at a long conference in Hamelen, with
his father the reigning duke, his uncle Prince Ferdinand,
and some principal members of the regency of Hanover.</P>
<P>§ LII. The French general continued to send out de∣tachments
to beat up the quarters of the allies, and lay
their towns under contribution. In the beginning of
March, the Marquis de Blai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marched at the head of
two thousand four hundred men from Giessen, where he
commanded, to Marpurg, forced the gates of the town,
and compelled the garrison of the allies to take shelter in
the castle. As he could not pretend to undertake the siege
of the fortress, by the fire of which he was exceedingly
galled, he demanded of the town a contribution of one
hundred thousand florins, and carried some of the magi∣strates
along with him, as hostages for the payment of this
imposition. He afterwards appeared at Hombourg,
Alsseldt, and Hartzberg, the frontier posts of the allies,
but did not think proper to attack either, because he per∣ceived
that measures were taken for his reception. The
French, with all their boasted politeness and humanity,
are sometimes found as brutal and rapacious as the most
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
barbarous enemy. On pretence of taking umbrage at the
town of Hanau-Muntzenberg, for having, without their
permission, acknowledged the vegency of the landgraviate
of Hesse-Cassel, they, in the month of February, ordered
the magistrates of that place to pay, within the term of
twenty-four hours, the sum of seven hundred and fifty
thousand livres, on pain of being subjected to plunder.
This order was signified by the Prince de Robecq: to
whom the magistrates represented the impossibility of
raising such a sum, as the country was totally exhausted,
and their credit absolutely destroyed, in consequence of
their inability to pay the interest of the capitals negociated
in the course of the preceding year. He still insisted upon
their finding the money before night, they offered to pay
eighty thousand florins, which they raised with the utmost
difficulty, and begged the payment of the rest might be
postponed for a few weeks: but their request was re∣jected
with disdain. The garrison was re-enforced by
two battalions, and four squadrons dispersed in the prin∣cipal
squares and markets of the city, and the gates were
shut. They even planted cannon in the streets, and tar∣red
matches were fixed to many houses, in order to in∣timidate
the inhabitants. These expedients proving
ineffectual, detachments of grenadiers entered the houses
of the principal magistrates and merchants, from whence
they removed all their best effects to the town-hall, where
they were kept in deposit, until they were redeemed with
all the money that could possibly be raised. This exaction,
so little to the honour of a civilised nation, the French
minister declared to the Diet at Ratisbon was agreeable
to the instructions of his Most Christian Majesty.</P>
<P>§ LIII. By way of retaliation for the cruelty practised at
Hanau, a detachment of the allied army under General
Luckner was sent to raise contributions in Fulda, and
actually carried off hostages from that city; but retired
before a strong body of the enemy, who took possession of
the place. From hence the French marched, in their
turn, to plunder the towns of Hirch feldt and Vacha.
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
Accordingly, they appeared at Vacha, situated on the fron∣tiers
of Hesse, and formed the head of the chain of canton∣ments
which the allies had on the Werra. This place
was attacked with such vigour, that Colonel Freytag,
who commanded the post, was obliged to abandon the
town; but he maintained himself on a rising ground in
the neighbourhood, where he amused the enemy until
two battalions of grenadiers came to his assistance. Thus
re-enforced, he pursued the French for three leagues,
and drove them with considerable loss from Geissa, where
they had resolved to fix their quarters. These skirmishes
happened in the beginning of May, when the grand
armies were just in motion to begin the campaign.</P>
<P>§ LIV. By this time the forces under the Mareschal
Duke de Broglio were augmented to one hundred thou∣sand;
while the Count de St. Germain commanded a
separate army on the Rhine, consisting of thirty thousand
men, assembled from the quarters of Dusseldorp, Cologn,
Cleves, and Wesel. The second corps was intended to
divide the allied army, which, by such a divison, would
be considerably weakened; and the French court threat∣ened
to form a third army, under the Prince de Soubise;
but this did not appear. The Duke de Broglio was in
such high favour with the French ministry at this juncture,
that he was promoted over the heads of many old generals,
who now demanded and obtained their dismission; and
every step was taken to render the campaign glorious to
this admired commander: but, notwithstanding all their
care, and his own exertion, he sound it impossible to take
the sield early in the season, from want of forage for his ca∣valry.
While his quarters were established at Franckfort,
his troops were plentifully supplied with all sorts of pre∣vision
from the Upper Rhine; but this convenience de∣pended
upon his being master of the course of the river:
but he could not move from this position without forfeit∣ing
the advantage, and providing magazines for the use of
his forces, so that he was obliged to lie inactive until he
could have the benefit of green forage in his march. The
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
same inconveniences operated more powerfully on the
side of Prince Ferdinand, who, being in an exhausted
country, was obliged to fall back as far as Paderborn,
and draw his supplies from Hamburgh and Bremen on
the Elbe and the Weser. By this time, however, he had
received a re-enforcement of British troops from Emb∣den,
under the direction of Major-General Griffin; and
before the end of the campaign the forces of that nation
in Germany were augmented to five and-twenty thou∣sand;
a greater number than had served at one time
upon the continent for two centuries. The allied army
marched from their cantonments on the fifth day of
May, and proceeded by the way of Paderborn to Fritzlar,
where, on the twentieth, they encamped: but part of
the troops left in the bishoprick of Munster, under Ge∣neral
Sporcken, were ordered to form a camp at Dulmen,
to make head against the French corps commanded by
the Count de St. Germain.</P>
<P>§ LV. General Imhoff was sent with a detachment to
Kirchavn on the Orme; and General Gilsoe, with ano∣ther
corps, advanced to the neighbourhood of Hirchfeldt,
on the Fulda. The former of these having ordered Col.
Luckner to scour the country with a body of hussars, that
officer, on the twenty-fourth of May, fell in with a French
patrole, which gave the alarm at Butzbach, when the
garrison of that place, amounting to five hundred piquets,
under General Waldener, fled with great precipitation.
Being, however, pursued, and overtaken near a wood, they
were routed and dispersed. Colonel Luckner, entering
Butzbach, found a considerable quantity of forage, flour,
wine, and equipage, belonging to the fugitives. What he
could not carry off he distributed among the poor inha∣bitants,
and returned to General Imhoff's camp at
Ameneburg, with above an hundred prisoners. This ex∣cursion
alarmed the enemy to such a degree, that their
whole army was put in motion; and the Duke de Brog∣lio,
in person, advanced with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge body of troops as far
as Friedberg: but understanding the allies had not
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
quitted their camp at Fritzlar, he returned to Franckfort,
after having cantoned that part of his army in the Wet∣teraw.
This alarm was not so mortifying as the succession
of the Wirtemberg troops, amounting to ten thousand
men, commanded by their duke in person, who left the
French army in disgust, and returned to his own country.
The Imperial army, under the Prince de Deuxponts,
quartered at Bamberg, began their march to Naumberg
on the twentieth of May; but one of their detachments
of cavalry having received a check from a body of Prussians
near Lutzen, they fell back; and on the fourth day of
June encamped at Lichtenfels, upon the Maine. The
small detachments of the grand armies, as well as those
belonging to the bodies commanded by General Sporeken
and the Count de St. Germain in the neighbourhood of
Dusseldorp, skirmished with various success. The He∣reditary
Prince of Brunswick being detached from the
allied army, with some battalions of grenadiers, and two
regiments of English dragoons, advanced to the country
of Fulda, where he was joined by the troops under Ge∣neral
Gilsoe, and atchieved some inconsiderable exploits,
particularly at Hosenfeldt and Zielbach, where he sur∣prised
and took divers parties of the enemy.</P>
<P>§ LVI. By the twenty-fourth of June Prince Ferdi∣nand,
quitting his situation at Fritzlar, marched to Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣lendorf,
and encamped on the hills between Ziegenheim
and Freysa, General Imhoss commanding at a small di∣stance
on the right, and the Hereditary Prince, now re∣turned
from Fulda, being posted on the left of the army.
In the mean time, the Duke de Broglio, assembling his
forces between Merlau and Laubach, advanced to Neu∣stadt,
where he encamped on the twenty-eighth day of the
month, and at the same time occupied a strong post at
Wassemburg. His intention was to penetrate through
the country of Hesse into Hanover, and make himself
entirely master of that electorate. With this view he re∣solved
to effect a junction with the Count de St. Germain,
whom he directed to advance towards Brilau and Corbach;
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
while he himself, decamping from Neustadt on the eighth
day of July, advanced by the way of Franckenberg.
Prince Ferdinand, having received intelligence that the
Count de St. Germain was in motion, began his march
from Ziegenheim, and on the ninth day of July reached
the heighths of Brunau, in the neighbourhood of Wil∣dungen.</P>
<P>§ LVII. The Hereditary Prince, at the head of the
advanced corps, re-enforced with some battalions and
squadrons under Major-General Griffin, was sent for∣wards
to Saxenhausen, whither the army followed the
next morning. The Hereditary Prince, continuing to
advance, found the enemy already formed at Corbach; but
judging their whole force did not exceed ten thousand in∣fantry
and seventeen squadrons, and being impelled by the
impetuosity of his own courage, he resolved to give them
battle. He accordingly attacked them about two in the
afternoon, and the action became very warm and obstinate;
but the enemy being continually reinforced with fresh
battalions, and having the advantage of a numerous artil∣lery,
all the Prince's efforts were ineffectual. Prince
Ferdinand, being at too great a distance to sustain him,
sent him an order to rejoin the army, which was by this
time formed at Saxenhausen. He forthwith made dis∣positions
for a retreat, which however was attended with
great confusion. The enemy, observing the disorder of
the allied troops, plied their artillery with redoubled di∣ligence,
while a powerful body of their cavalry charged
with great vivacity. In all likelihood the whole infantry
of the allies would have been cut off, had not the Here∣ditary
Prince made a diversion in their favour, by charging
in person at the head of the British dragoons, who acted
with their usual gallantry and effect. This respite enabled
the infantry to accomplish their retreat to Saxenhausen;
but they lost above five hundred men, and fifteen pieces of
cannon. General Count Kielmansegge, Major-General
Griffin, and Major Hill, of Bland's dragoons, distinguish∣ed
themselves by their conduct and intrepidity on this
<PB N="248" REF="253"/>
occasion. The Hereditary Prince exposed his life in the
hottest part of the action, and received a slight wound
in the shoulder, which gave him far less disturbance than
he felt from the chagrin and mortification produced by
his defeat.</P>
<P>§ LVIII. Many days, however, did not pass, before he
found an opportunity of reta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ating this disgrace. Prince
Ferdinand, receiving advice that a body of the enemy,
commanded by Major-General Glaubitz, had advanced
on the left of the allies to Zieg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nheim, detached the Here∣ditary
Prince to oppose them, at the head of six battalions
of Hanoverians and Hessians, with Elliot's regiment of
English light horse, Luckner's hussars, and two brigades
of chasseurs; on the sixteenth day of the month, he engaged
the enemy near the village of Exdorff, and a very warm
action ensued, in which Elliot's regiment signalized them∣selves
remarkably by repeated charges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though this was the first time that Elliot's regiment appeared in the field, it performed wonders. They charged five different times, and broke through the enemy at every charge: but these exploits they did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without sustaining a heavy loss in officers, men, and horses.</NOTE>. At length victory
declared for the allies. Five battalions of the enemy, in∣cluding
the commander in chief, and the Prince of An∣halt
Cothen, were taken, with six pieces of cannon, all
their arms, baggage, and artillery. During these trans∣actions,
the Mareschal Duke de Broglio remained en∣camped
on the heighths of Corbach. He had, in advanc∣ing
from Franckfort, left detachments to reduce the
castles of Marpourg and Dillembourg, which were occupied
by the allies, and they fell into his hands, the garrisons of
both being obliged to surrender prisoners of war. These
were but inconsiderable conquests; nor did the progress of
the French general equal the idea which had been formed
of his talents and activity. The Count de St. Germain,
who was his senior officer, and believed by many to be at
least his equal in capacity, having now joined his corps to
the grand army, and conceiving disgust at his being obliged
to serve under the Duke de Broglio, relinquished his
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
command, in which he was succeeded by the Chevalier de
Muy. At the same time, the Marquis de Voyer, and the
Count de Luc, two generals of experience and reputation,
quitted the army, and returned to France, actuated by the
same motives.</P>
<P>§ LIX. The allied army having moved their camp
from Saxenhausen to the village of Kalle, near Cassel,
remained in that situation till the thirtieth day of July,
when the troops were again put in motion. The Che∣valier
de Muy, having passed the Dymel at Stadtbergen,
with the reserve of the French army, amounting to thirty-five
thousand men, and extending this body down the
banks of the river, in order to cut off the communication
of the allies with Wes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phalia; while the Duke de Brog∣lio
marched up with his main wing to their camp at Kalle,
and Prince Xavier of Saxony, who commanded their re∣serve
on the left, advanced towards Cassel; Prince Fer∣dinand,
leaving General Kielmansegge with a body of
troops for the defence of this city, decamped in the night of
the thirtieth, and passed the Dymel without loss, between
G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enau and Dringleberg. The Hereditary Prince, who
had the preceding day passed the same river, in order to
re-enforce General Sporcken, who was posted near Cor∣beke,
now reconnoitred the position of the enemy, and
found them possessed of a very advantageous camp between
Warbourg and Ochsendor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f. Prince Ferdinand having
resolved to attack them, ordered the Hereditary Prince
and Gen. Sporcken to turn their left, while he himself ad∣vanced
against their front, with the main body of the
army. The enemy was accordingly attacked, almost at
the same instant, both in flank and in rear, with equal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpetuosity and success. As the insantry of the allied
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy could not march fast enough to charge at the same
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, the Marquis of Granby was ordered to advance with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he cavalry of the right; and the brigade of English artil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery,
commanded by Captain Phillips, made such expe∣dition,
that they were up in time to second the attack in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most surprising manner. The French cavalry, though
<PB N="250" REF="255"/>
very numerous, retreated at the approach of the marquis,
except three squadrons, who stood the charge, and were
immediately broken. Then the English horse fell upon
the enemy's infantry, which suffered greatly, while the
town of Warbourg was assaulted by the Britannick legion.
The French, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inding themselves hard pressed on both
flanks, as well as in front and rear, retired precipitately,
with considerable damage, occasioned chiefly by the British
cannon and dragoons, and many were drowned in attempt∣ing
to ford the Dymel. The battalion of Maxwell, and
a brigade under Colonel Beckwith, composed of grena∣diers
and highlanders, distinguished themselves remarkably
on this occasion. The enemy left about fifteen hundred
men, killed or wounded, on the field of battle; with some
colours, and ten pieces of cannon; and about the same
number were made prisoners. Monsieur de Muy lay all
night under arms, on the heighths of Volk-Missen, from
whence he next day retired towards Wolf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hagen. On the
evening of the battle the Marquis of Granby received
orders to pass the river in pursuit of them, with twelv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>IT is with the greatest satisfaction that I have the honour of acqua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your lordship of the success of the Hereditary Prince yesterday morning. General Sporcken's corps marched from the camp at Kalle to Lieb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> about four in the afternoon of the twenty-ninth; the Hereditary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> followed the same evening, with a body of troops, among which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> two English battalions of g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enadiers, the two of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghlanders, and four <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of dragoons, Cope's and Conway's. The army was under arms all day on the thirtieth, and, about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at night, marched off in six columns to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ebenau. About five the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> morning the whole army assembled, and formed on the heighths ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke. The Hereditary Prince was, at this time, m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rching in two colum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in order to turn the enemy's left flank; which he did by marching to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, leaving Klein-Eder on his left; and forming in two lines, with left towards Dossel, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight near Grimbeck, opposite to the left <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the enemy, whole position was with the left to the high hill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Offiendorff, and their right to Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bourg, into which place they had flung <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ischer's corps. The Hereditary Prince immediately attacked the enemy's flank, and, after a very sharp di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pute, obliged them to give way, and, by a continued fire, kept forcing them to fall back upon Warbourg. The army was, at this time, marching with the greatest disigence to attack the enemy in front; but the infantry could not get up in time; General Waldegrave, at the head of the British, pressed their mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch as much as possible: no troops could shew more eagerness to get up than they shewed. Many of the men, from the heat of the weather, and ever-straining themselves to get on through morassy and very difficult ground, suddenly dropped down on their march.</P>
<P>General Mosty n, who was at the head of the British cavalry that was formed on the right of our infantry on the other side of a large wood, upon receiving the Duke's orders to come up with the cavalry as fast as possible, made so much expedition, bringing them up at a full trot, though the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance was near five m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, that the British cavalt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y had the happiness to arrive in time to share the glory of the day, having successfully charged several times both the ene∣my's cavalry and infantry.</P>

<P>Captain Phillips made so much expedition with his cannon, as to have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n opportunity, by a severe cannonade, to oblige those who had passed the Dymel, and were formed on the other side, to retire with the utmost precipitation</P>

B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="251" REF="256"/>
this success, Prince Ferdinand was enabled to maintain
his communication with Westphalia, and keep the enemy
at a distance from the heart of Hanover; but to these ob∣jects
he sacrificed the country of Cassel: for Prince Xavier
of Saxony, at the head of a detached body, much more
numerous than that which was left under General Kiel∣mansegge,
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
advanced towards Cassel, and made himself
master of that city; then he reduced Munden, Gottingen,
and Eimbeck, in the electorate of Hanover. All that
Prince Ferdinand could do, considering how much he
was out-numbered by the French, was to secure posts and
passes, with a view to retard their progress, and employ
detachments to harrass and surprise their advanced parties.
In a few days after the action at Warbourg, General
Luckner repulsed a French detachment, which had ad∣vanced
as far as Eimbeck, and surprised another at Nord∣heim.
At the same period, Colonel Donap, with a body
of the allied army, attacked a French corps of two thou∣sand
men, posted in the wood of Sababourg, to preserve
the communication between their grand army, and their
troops on the other side of the Weser; and, notwithstand∣ing
the strength of their situation, drove them from their
post, with the loss of five hundred men, either killed or
made prisoners; but this advantage was overbalanced by
the reduction of Ziegenheim, garrisoned by seven hundred
men of the allied army, who, after a vigorous resistance,
were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war.</P>
<P>§ LX. On the fifth day of August, Prince Ferdinand
being encamped at Buhne, received intelligence that a
considerable body of the enemy, amounting to upwards
of twenty thousand men, were in motion to make a gene∣ral
forage in the neighbourhood of Geismar. He passed
the Dimel early in the morning, with a body of troops,
and some artillery, and posted them in such an advan∣tageous
manner, as to render the enemy's attempt totally
ineffectual, although the foragers were covered with
great part of their army. On the same morning the
Hereditary Prince set out on an expedition to beat up the
quarters of a French detachment. Being informed that
the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphinè, to the num∣ber
of one thousand, horse and foot, were cantoned at
Zierenberg, at a small distance from the French camp at
Dierenberg, and passed their time in the most careless
security, he advanced towards them from his camp at
<PB N="253" REF="258"/>
Warbourg, within a league of their cantonment, with∣out
seeing any of their posts, or meeting with any of
their patroles; a circumstance that encouraged him to
beat up their quarters by surprise: for this service he
pitched upon five battalions, with a detachment of High∣landers,
and eight regiments of dragoons. Leaving their
tents standing, they began their march at eight in the
evening, and passed the Dymel near Warbourg. About
a league on the other side of the Dymel, at the village of
Witzen, they were joined by the light troops under
Major Bulow; and now the disposition was made, both
for entering the town, and securing a retreat, in case of
being repulsed. When they were within two miles of
Zierenberg, and in sight of the fires of the enemy's grand
guard, the grenadiers of Maxwell, the regiment of
Kingsley, and the Highlanders, advanced by three sepa∣rate
roads, and marched in profound silence: at length,
the noise of their feet alarmed the French, who began to
fire; then the grenadiers proceeded at a round pace with
unloaded fire locks, pushed the piquets, slew the guard
at the gate, and rushing into the town, drove every thing
before them with incredible impetuosity. The attack
was so sudden, and the surprise so great, that the French
had not time to assemble in any considerable number; but
they began to fire from the windows, and in so doing,
exasperated the allied troops, who bursting into the
houses, slaughtered them without mercy. Having re∣mained
in the place from two till three in the morning,
they retreated with about four hundred prisoners, in∣cluding
forty officers; and brought off two pieces of
artillery. This nocturnal adventure, in which the Bri∣tish
troops displayed equal courage and activity, was
atchieved with very little loss; but, after all, it deserves
no other appellation than that of a partizan exploit,
for it was attended with no sort of advantage to the allied
army.</P>
<P>§ LXI. Considering the superiority of the French army,
we cannot account for the little progress made by the
<PB N="254" REF="259"/>
Duke de Broglio, who, according to our conception,
might either have given battle to the allies with the ut∣most
probability of success; or penetrated into the heart
of Hanover, the conquest of which seemed to be the prin∣cipal
object of the French ministry. Instead of striking
an important stroke, he retired from Immenhausen towards
Cassel, where he fortified his camp as if he had thought
himself in danger of being attacked; and the war was
carried on by small detachments. Major Bulow, being
sent with a strong party from the camp of the allied army
at Buline, surprised the town of Marpurg, destroyed the
French ovens, and brought off a considerable quantity of
stores and baggage, with some prisoners. He met with
the same success at Butzbach, where he surprised and
took two companies belonging to the regiment of Rau∣grave,
and retired with his body to Franckenberg, where
he joined Colonel Forsen. On the twelfth day of Sep∣tember
they made a movement towards Franckenau; and
M. de Stainville, who was posted with a body of French
troops at Merdenhagen, advanced to check their progress.
He came up with their rear in the neighbourhood of Mun∣den,
and attacked them in passing the river Orck with
such vigour, that Forsen, with some of his cavalry, was
taken, and Bulow obliged to abandon some pieces of can∣non.
The action was just determined, when this last
was re-enforced by the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick,
who had made a forced march of five German miles,
which had fatigued the troops to such a degree, that he de∣ferred
his attack till next morning; but, in the mean
time, M. de Stainville retired towards Franckenberg.
The Hanoverian General Wangenheim, at the head of
four battalions and six squadrons, had driven the enemy
from the defiles of Sohcite, and encamped at Lawen∣thagen;
but, being attacked by a superior number, he
was obliged, in his turn, to give way, and his retreat was
not effected without the loss of two hundred men, and
some pieces of artillery. When the enemy retired, Ge∣neral
Wangenheim repassed the Weser, and occupied his
<PB N="255" REF="260"/>
former situation at Ussar. Mean while, General Luck∣ner
gained an advantage over a detachment of French
cavalry near Norten. Prince Ferdinand, when Mares∣chal
Broglio quitted his camp at Immenhausen, made a
motion of his troops, and established his head-quarters
at Geismar-wells, the residence of the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel; from thence, however, he transferred
them, about the latter end of September, to Ovilgune,
on the Westphalian side of the Dymel.</P>
<P>§ LXII. Such was the position of the two opposite
grand armies, when the world was surprised by an ex∣pedition
to the Lower Rhine, made by the Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick. Whether this excursion was in∣tended
to hinder the French from re-enforcing their army
in Westphalia, or to co-operate in the Low Countries
with the armament now ready equipped in the ports of
England; or to gratify the ambition of a young prince,
overboiling with courage, and glowing with the desire of
conquest; we cannot explain to the satisfaction of the
reader: certain it is, the Austrian Netherlands were,
at this juncture, entirely destitute of troops, except the
French garrisons of Ostend and Nieuport, which were
weak and inconsiderable. Had ten thousand English
troops been landed on the coast of Blankenburg, they
might have taken possession of Bruges, Ghent, Brussels,
and Antwerp, without resistance, and joined the Here∣ditary
Prince in the heart of the country: in that case
he would have found himself at the head of thirty thou∣sand
men, and might have made such a diversion in fa∣vour
of Hanover, as to transfer the seat of war from
Westphalia into Flanders. The Empress-Queen might,
indeed, have complained of this invasion, as the formality
of declaring war against her had not been observed by
Great-Britain; but, considering that she was the declared
enemy of Hanover, and had violated the barrier treaty,
in establishing which the kingdom of Great-Britain had
lavished away so much blood and treasure, a step of
this kind, we apprehend, might have been taken, with∣out
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
any imputation of perfidy or injustice. Whatever
the motives for the prince's expedition might have been,
he certainly quitted the grand army of the allies in the
month of September, and traversing Westphalia, with
twenty battalions, and as many squadrons, appeared on
the Lower Rhine, marching by Schermbeck and Dussel∣dorp.
On the twenty-ninth day of the month, he sent a
large detachment over the river at Rocroot, which sur∣prised
part of the French partisan Fischer's corps at Rhyn∣berg,
and scoured the country. Next day, other parties,
crossing at Rees and Emmerick, took possession of some
redoubts which the French had raised along the bank
of the river; and here they found a number of boats, suf∣ficient
to transport the rest of the forces. Then the Prince
advanced to Cleves, and at his approach the French
garrison, consisting of five hundred men, under the com∣mand
of M. de Barral, retired into the castle, which,
however, they did not long defend; for on the third day
of October they capitulated, and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war, after having in vain endeavoured to ob∣tain
more favourable conditions.</P>
<P>§ LXIII. A more important object was Wesel, which
the prince invested, and began to besiege in form. The
approaches were made on the right of the Rhine, while
the Prince in person remained on the left, to cover the
siege; and kept his communication open with the other
side, by a bridge above, and another below the place.
He had hoped to carry it by a vigorous ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion, without the formality of a regular siege, but he met with a warmer
reception than he expected, and his operations were re∣tarded
by heavy rains, which, by swelling the river, en∣dangered
his bridges and laid his trenches under water.
The difficulties and delays occasioned by this circumstance
entirely frustrated his design. The French, being made
acquainted with his motions, were not slow in taking
measures to anticipate his success. M. de Castries was
detached after him with thirty battalions, and thirty-eight
squadrons; and, by forced marches, arrived on the
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
fourteenth day of October, at Rhynberg, where the
prince's light troops were posted. These he attacked im∣mediately,
and compelled to abandon the post, notwith∣standing
all the efforts of the Prince, who commanded in
person, and appeared in the warmest parts of this short,
but sanguinary affair. The enemy, leaving five batta∣lions,
with some squadrons, at Rhynberg, marched by
the left, and encamped behind the convent of Campen.
The Prince, having received intimation that M. de
Castries was not yet joined by some re-enforcements that
were on the march, determined to be beforehand with
them, and attempt that very night to surprise him
in his camp. For this purpose he began his march at
ten in the evening, after having left four battalions,
and five squadrons, under General Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, with in∣structions
to observe Rhynberg, and attack that post,
in case the attempt on Campen should succeed. Be∣fore
the allied forces could reach the enemy's camp,
they were under the necessity of overpowering Fischer's
corps of irregulars, which occupied the convent of Cam∣pen,
at the distance of half a league in their front. This
service occasioned some firing, the noise of which alarmed
the French army. Their commander formed them with
great expedition, and posted them in a wood, where
they were immediately attacked, and at first obliged to
give ground; but they soon retrieved all they had lost,
and sustained without flinching an unceasing fire of mus∣quetry,
from five in the morning till nine at night, when
they reaped the fruits of their perseverance. The Here∣ditary
Prince, whose horse was killed under him, seeing
no prospect of success in prolonging an action which
had already cost him a considerable number of men,
thought proper to give orders for a retreat, which was not
effected without confusion, and left the field of battle to
the enemy. His loss, on this occasion, did not fall short of
sixteen hundred choice men, killed, wounded, and taken;
and this loss fell chiefly on the troops of Great-Britain,
who were always found in the foremost ranks of danger.
<PB N="258" REF="263"/>
All the officers, both of infantry and dragoons, distin∣guished
themselves remarkably, and many were dange∣rously
wounded. Among these, the nation regretted the
loss of Lord Downe, whose wounds proved mortal: he
was a young nobleman of spirit, who had lately embraced
a military life, though he was not regularly trained in the
service.</P>
<P>LXIV. Next day, which was the sixteenth of Octo∣ber,
the enemy attacked an advanced body of the allies,
which was posted in a wood before Elverick, and extended
along the Rhine. The firing of cannon and musquetry
was maintained till night. Mean while, a column of the
French infantry, commanded by M. de Chabot, marched
through Walach, and took post among the thickets, at
the distance of a quarter of a league, in the front of the
Prince's army. By this time the Rhine was so much
swelled by the rains, and the banks of it were overflowed
in such a manner, that it was necessary to repair and
move lower down the bridge which had been thrown
over that river. This work was accordingly performed
in presence of the enemy, and the Prince, passing with∣out
molestation, proceeded to Bruynen, where he fixed
his head-quarters. His passing the Rhine so easily, under
the eye of a victorious army, so much superior to him in
number, may be counted among the fortunate incidents
of his life. Such was the issue of an expedition, which
exposed the projector of it to the imputation of temerity.
Whatever his aim might have been, besides the reduction
of Wesel, with the strength of which he did not seem
to have been very well acquainted, he certainly mis∣carried
in his design, and his miscarriage was attended
with a very considerable loss of troops, occasioned not
only by the action, but also by the diseases engendered
from the wet weather, the fatigue of long marches, and
the want of proper conveniences, not to mention the
enormous expense in contingencies, incurred by this fruit∣less
undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="264"/>
§ LXV. In the month of November, while he lay
encamped in the neighbourhood of Schermbeck, a body
of the enemy attempted to beat up his quarters: having re∣ceived
intimation of their design, he immediately called
in his advanced posts, and made a disposition for giving
them a proper reception. He abandoned the tents that
were in the front of his camp, and posted his infantry in
ambuscade behind those that were in the rear: at the same
time he ordered some regiments of horse and hussars to
fetch a compass, and fall upon the back of the enemy.
This stratagem succeeded to his wish. The French de∣tachment,
believing the allies had actually abandoned
their camp, began to pillage the tents in the utmost dis∣order:
then the infantry sallied from the place where
they were concealed, and fell upon them with great im∣petuosity:
the artillery opened, and the cavalry charged
them in flank. In a word, of twelve hundred who march∣ed
from Wesel on this expedition, scarce two hundred
escaped.</P>
<P>§ LXVI. The Duke de Broglio endeavoured, by sun∣dry
means, to take advantage of the allied army on the
other side to the Weser, thus weakened by the absence of
the troops under the Hereditary Prince; but he found
Prince Ferdinand too vigilant to be surprised, and too
strongly situated to be attacked with any prospect of suc∣cess.
He, therefore, contented himself with ravaging
the country by detachments: he sent M. de Stainville,
with a considerable body of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces, to penetrate into the
heart of Hanover; and on the fifteenth day of September,
that officer falling in with a detachment of the allies,
commanded by Major Bulow, attacked them near the
abbey of Schaken. After a warm and obstinate engage∣ment,
they were defeated, and driven to Bulemont, with
the loss of their cannon, baggage, and a good number of
men, who fell into the hands of the victors. After this
exploit, M. de Stainville advanced to Halberstadt, and
demanded of that capital a contribution of one million
five hundred thousand livres: but the citizens had been
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
so drained by former exactions, that they could not raise
above thirty thousand: for the remainder the French
partizan took hostages, with whom he returned to the
grand army encamped at Cassel, from whence they, in a
little time, fell back as far as Gottingen.</P>
<P>§ LXVII. As the enemy retreated Prince Ferdinand
advanced as far as Hurste, where he established his head∣quarters
about the latter end of November. While he
remained in this position, divers skirmishes happened in
the neighbourhood of Gottingen. Major-General Brei∣denbach,
at the head of two regiments of Hanoverian
and Brunswick guards, with a detachment of cavalry,
attacked, on the twenty-ninth day of November, the
French post at Heydemunden, upon the river Worrau.
This he carried, and took possession of the town, which
the enemy hastily abandoned. Part of their detachment
crossed the river in boats; the rest threw themselves into
an entrenchment that covered the passage, which the allies
endeavoured to force in several unsuccessful attempts,
galled as they were by the fire of the enemy's redoubts on
the other side of the river. At length M. Breidenbach
was obliged to desist, and fall back into the town, from
whence he retired at midnight, after having sustained con∣siderable
damage. Prince Ferdinand had it very much at
heart to drive the French from Gottingen, and accord∣ingly
invested that city; but the French garrison, which
was numerous, and well provided, made such a vigorous
defence, as baffled all the endeavours of the allies, who
were moreover impeded by the rainy weather, which,
added to other considerations, prevented them from un∣dertaking
the siege in form. Nevertheless, they kept the
place blocked up from the twenty-second day of Novem∣ber
to the twelfth of the following month, when the gar∣rison,
in a desperate sally, took one of their principal posts,
and compelled them to raise the blockade. About the
middle of December, Prince Ferdinand retired into win∣ter-quarters,
he himself residing at Uslar, and the English
troops being cantoned in the bishoprick of Paderborn.
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII. 1760.</NOTE> the enemy were left in possession of Hesse, and the
whole country eastward of the Weser, to the frontiers of
the electorate of Hanover. If the allied army had not
been weakened, for the sake of a rash, ill-concerted,
and unsuccessful expedition to the Lower-Rhine, in all
probability the French would have been obliged to abandon
the footing they had gained in the course of this campaign,
and in particular to retreat from Gottingen, which they
now maintained and fortified with great diligence and cir∣cumspection.</P>

<P>§ I. THE King of Prussia, after all his labours, not∣withstanding
the great talents he had displayed,
and the incredible efforts he had made, still found himself
surrounded by his enemies, and in danger of being crushed,
by their closing, and contracting their circle. Even the
Swedes, who had languished so long, seemed to be roused
to exertion in Pomerania, during the severity of the winter
<PB N="263" REF="268"/>
season.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV. 1760.</NOTE> The Prussian general, Manteuffel, had, on the
twentieth day of January, passed the river Peene, over∣thrown
the advanced posts of the enemy at Ziethen, and
penetrated as far as the neighbourhood of Griessewalde;
but finding the Swedes on their guard, he returned to
Anclam, where his head-quarters were established. This
insult was soon retaliated with interest. On the twenty-eighth
day of the month, at five in the morning, a body of
Swedes attacked the Prussian troops posted in the suburbs
of Anclam, on the other side of the Peene, and drove them
into the city, which they entered pell-mell. General
Manteuffel, being alarmed, endeavoured to rally the
troops, but was wounded and taken, with about two hun∣dred
men, and three pieces of cannon. The victors, hav∣ing
atchieved this exploit, returned to their own quarters.
As for the Russian army, which had wintered on the
other side of the Vistula, the season was pretty far advanced
before it could take the field; though General Tottleben
was detached from it, about the beginning of June, at the
head of ten thousand Cossacks, and other light troops, with
which he made an irruption into Pomerania, and esta∣blished
his head-quarters at Belgard.</P>
<P>§ II. At the beginning of the campaign the King of
Prussia's chief aim was to take measures for the preserva∣tion
of Silesia, the conquest of which seemed to be the
principal object with the court of Vienna. While the
Austrian army, under Mareschal Count Daun, lay strong∣ly
entrenched in the neighbourhood of Dresden, the King
of Prussia had endeavoured, in the month of December,
to make him quit that advantageous situation, by cutting
off his provisions, and making an irruption into Bohemia.
For th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se purposes he had taken possession of Dippeswalde,
Maxen, and Pretchendorss, as if he intended to enter Bo∣hemia
by the way of Passberg: but this scheme being
found impracticable, he returned to his camp at Freyberg;
and in January the Prussian and Austrian armies were
cantoned so near each other, that daily skirmishes were
fought with various success. The head of the Prussian
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
camp was formed by a body of four thousand men under
Gen. Zettwitz, who, on the twenty-ninth day of January,
was attacked with such impetuosity by the Austrian gene∣ral,
Beck, that he retreated in great confusion to Torgau,
with the loss of five hundred men, eight pieces of artille∣ry,
and a considerable quantity of new clothing, and
other baggage. Another advantage of the same nature
was gained by the Austrians at Neustadt over a small body
of Prussians who occupied that city. In the month of
March General Laudohn advanced with a strong detach∣ment
of horse and foot, in order to surprise the Prussians,
who, in attempting to effect a retreat to Steinau, were
surrounded accordingly, and very roughly handled. Gene∣ral
Laudohn summoned them twice by sound of trumpet
to lay down their arms; but their commanders, the Cap∣tains
Blumenthal and Zettwitz, rejecting the proposal
with disdain, the enemy attacked them on all hands with
a great superiority of number. In this emergency the
Prussian captains formed their troops into a square, and
by a close continued fire kept the enemy at bay; until
perceiving that the Croats had taken possession of a wood
between Siebenhausen and Steinau, they, in apprehension
of being intercepted, abandoned their baggage, and
forced their way to Steinau, which they reached with
great difficulty, having been continually harrassed by the
Austrians, who paid dear for this advantage. Several
other petty exploits of this kind were atchieved by detach∣ments
on both sides, before the campaign was begun by
the grand armies.</P>
<P>§ III. Towards the end of April the King of Prussia
altered his position, and withdrew that part of his chain
of cantonments extending from the forest of Thurundt
to the right of the Elbe. He now took possession of a
very strong camp between the Elbe and the Mulda, which
he entrenched in every part that was accessible, and forti∣fied
with two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon. By
these precautions he was enabled to keep his ground
against the army of Count Daun, and at the same time
<PB N="265" REF="270"/>
detach a body of troops, as a re-enforcement to his brother
Prince Henry, who assembled a separate army near Franck∣fort
upon the Oder, that he might be at hand either to
oppose the Russians, or march to the relief of Silesia,
which the enemy was bent upon invading. It was for
this purpose that the Austrian general, Laudohn, advan∣ced
with a considerable army into Lusatia about the be∣ginning
of May, and General Beck, with another body
of troops, took possession of Cotbus: mean while Count
Daun continued in his old situation on the Elbe; Gene∣ral
Lacy formed a small detached army upon the frontiers
of Saxony, to the southward of Dresden; and the
Prince de Deuxponts marched into the same neighbour∣hood
with the army of the Empire. Prince Henry of
Prussia, having encamped with his army for some time at
Sagan, in Silesia, moved from thence to Gorlitz in Lu∣satia,
to observe the motions of General Laudohn, en∣camped
at Koninsgratz; from whence, in the beginning
of June, he marched into the country of Glatz, and ad∣vanced
to the neighbourhood of Schweidnitz, which he
seemed determined to besiege, having a train of eight
pieces of cannon. With a view to thwart his designs,
Prince Henry re-enforced the body of troops under
General Fouquet; and at the same time he sent a detach∣ment
into Pomerania, under Colonel Lessow, who de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated
the rear-guard of General Tottleben, and com∣pelled
that officer to evacuate Pomerania. By this time,
however, Mareschal Soltikoff had arrived from Peters∣burgh,
and taken the command of the grand Russian
army, which passed the Vistula in June, and began its
march towards the frontiers of Silesia.</P>
<P>§ IV. In the month of June General Laudohn made
an unsuccessful attempt to carry Glatz by assault: but he
succeeded better in his next enterprise. Understanding
that General Fouquet, who occupied the post at Land∣shut,
had weakened himself by sending off detachments
under the Major-Generals Ziethen and Grant, he resolved
to attack him with such a superiority of number, that he
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>
should not be able to resist. Accordingly, on the twenty-third
day of June, at two in the morning, he began the
assault with his whole army upon some redoubts which
Fouquet occupied, and these were carried one after ano∣ther,
though not without a very desperate opposition.
General Fouquet being summoned to surrender, refused
to submit; and having received two wounds, was at
length taken prisoner: about three thousand of his m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
escaped to Breslau; the rest were killed or taken; but the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the victors is said to have exceeded that of the vanquished.
In July General Laudohn undertook the siege of Glatz,
which was taken after a very faint resistance: for, on the
very day the batteries were opened against the place, the
garrison abandoned part of the fortifications, which the
besiegers immediately occupied. The Prussians made re∣peated
efforts to regain the ground they had lost; but they
were repulsed in all their attempts. At length the garri∣son
laid down their arms, and surrendered at discretion.
From this tame behaviour of the Prussians, one would
imagine the garrison must have been very weak, a circum∣stance
which we cannot reconcile with the known sagacity
of the Prussian monarch, as the place was of great im∣portance,
on account of the immense magazine it con∣tained,
including above one hundred brass cannon, a great
number of mortars, and a vast quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P>§ V. Laudohn, encouraged by his success at Glatz,
advanced immediately to Breslau, which he began to
bombard with great fury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Germans are in general but indifferent engineers, and little ac∣quainted with the art of besieging. On this occasion the Austrian General had no other prospect than that of carrying the place by a sudden attack, or intimidating Count Tavenzein, the governor, to an immediate su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> for he knew the Russian army was at a considerable distance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the character of Prince Henry of Prussia, that he would advan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the relief of the place long before it could be taken according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forms. Influenced by these considerations, when he had invested the town, he sent a letter to the governor, specifying, that his army consisted of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> battalions and fourscore squadrons; that the Russian army, amounting to seventy-five thousand men, was within three days march of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>slau; that no succour could be expected from the King of Prussia, encamped as he was on the other side of the Elbe, and over-awed by the army of Count Daun; that Prince Henry, far from being in a condition to bring relief, would not be able to stand his ground against the Russians; that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being an open mercantile town, not a fortress, could not be de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended without con∣travening the established rules of war; and therefore the governor, in case of obstinacy, had no reason to expect an honourable capitua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, the benefit of which was now offered. He, at the same time, sent a memorial to the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il magistrates, threatening their town with destruction, which could by no other means be prevented than by joining with the inhabitants in persuading the governor to embrace immediately the terms that were proposed. Count Tavenzein, instead of being intimidated, was encouraged by these menaces, which implied an apprehension in Laudohn that the place would be relieved. He, therefore, replied to the summons he had received, that Breslau was not simply a mercantile town, but ought to be considered as a place of strength, as being surrounded with works and wet ditches; that the Austrians them∣selves had defended it as such after the battle of Lissa, in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and fifty-seven; that the King his master having com∣manded him to defend the place to the last extremity, he could neither com∣ply with General La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dohn's proposals, nor pay the least regard to his threats of destroying the town, as he had not been entrusted with the care of the houses, but with the defence of the fortification. The Austrian con∣vinced him that same evening, that he threatened nothing but what he me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to perform. He opened his batteries, and poured in upon the town a most terrible shower of bombs and red-hot bullets, which continued till midnight. During this dreadful discharge, which sided the place with hor∣rour and desolation, he attempted the out works by assault. The Croats at∣tacked the covered way in different places with their usual in petuosity; but were repulsed with considerable lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, by the conduct and resolution of the governor and ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ison. These proceedings having made no impression on Taven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in, the besieging general had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again to negociation, and offered the most flatterin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> articles of capitulation, which were rejected with disdain. The governor gave him to understand, that the destruction of the town had made no change in his resloution, though it was a practice con∣trary to the law of arms, as well as to the dictates of common humanity, to begin the siege of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by ruining the inhabitants: finally, he assured him he would wait for him upon the ramp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and defend the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the utmost of his power. His observations were certainly just: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more infamously inhuman than this practice of making war upon the help∣less unarmed inhabitants of a town which has the misfortune to be be∣leaguered; yet the besieger pleaded the example of the Prus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian monarch, who had before acted the same tragedy at Dresden. Laudohn being thus set at de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance, continued to batter and bombard, and several subsequent assaults were given to the fortifications.</NOTE>; but, before he could make a
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
regular attack, he found himself obliged to retire. Prince
Henry of Prussia, one of the most accomplished generals
which this a geproduced, having received repeated intelligence
<PB N="268" REF="273"/>
that the Russian army intended to join Laudohn at Bressau, resolved to advance, and give them battle before the pur∣posed
junction. In the latter end of July he began his
march from Gleissen, and on the last day of that month
had reached Linden, near Slauve, where he understood that
Tottleben's detachment only had passed through the
plains of Polnich-Lissa, and that the grand Russian army
had marched through Kosten and Gustin. The Prince,
finding it impossible to pursue them by that route, directed
his march to Glougau, where he learned that Breslau was
besieged by General Laudohn, and immediately advanced
by forced marches to its relief. Such was his expedition,
that in five days he marched above one hundred and twen∣ty
English miles, and at his approach the Austrian ge∣neral
abandoned his enterprise. Thus, by his prudence
and activity, he not only prevented the junction of the
Russian and Austrian armies, but also saved the capital
of Silesia, and hampered Laudohn in such a manner as
subjected him to a defeat by the Prussian monarch, to
whose motions we shall now turn our attention.</P>
<P>§ VI. Whether his design was originally upon Dres∣den,
or he purposed to co-operate with his brother Prince
Henry in Silesia, which his adversaries seemed to have
pitched upon as the scene of their operations, we cannot
presume to determine: but certain it is, he, in the begin∣ning
of July, began his march in two columns through
Lusatia, and Count Daun being informed of his march,
ordered his army to be put in motion. Leaving the army
of the empire, and the body of troops under Lacy, to guard
Saxony in his absence, he marched with great expedition
towards Silesia, in full persuasion that the Prussian mo∣narch
had thither directed his route. On the seventh day
of July, the King, knowing that Daun was now removed
at a distance, repassed the Pulsnitz, which he had passed
but two days before, and advanced with the van of his
army towards Lichtenberg, in order to attack the forces
of General Lacy, who was posted there; but the Austrian
retired at his approach. Then the army marched to
<PB N="269" REF="274"/>
Marienstern, where the King received intelligence that
Count Daun was in full march for Lauban, having al∣ready
gained two marches upon the Prussians. Perhaps
it was this intimation that determined the King to change
his plan, and return to the Elbe. On the eighth day of
the month he repassed the Sprehe, in the neighbourhood of
Bautzen, and marched towards Dresden with extraordinary
diligence. On the thirteenth his army having passed the
Elbe at Kadetz, on a bridge of boats, encamped be∣tween
Pirna and Dresden, which last he resolved to be∣siege,
in hopes of reducing it before Count Daun could
return to its relief. How far this expectation was well
grounded we must leave to the reader to judge, after hav∣ing
observed, that the place was now much more
defensible than it had been when the last attempt of the
Austrians upon it miscarried; that it was secured with a
numerous garrison, commanded by General Macguire,
an officer of courage and experience. This governour
being summoned to surrender, answered, that having the
honour to be entrusted with the defence of the capital, he
would maintain it to the last extremity. Batteries were
immediately raised against the town on both sides of the
Elbe; and the poor inhabitants subjected to a dreadful
visitation, that their calamities might either drive them to
despair, or move the heart of the governour to embrace
articles of capitulation: but these expedients proved in∣effectual.
Though the suburbs towards the Pirna gate
were attacked and carried, this advantage made no im∣pression
on General Macguire, who made several vigorous
sallies, and took every necessary precaution for the de∣fence
of the city, encouraged moreover by the vicinity of
Lacy's body, and the army of the empire, encamped in an
advantageous position near Gros Seydlitz; and confident
that Count Daun would hasten to his relief. In this hope
he was not disappointed; the Austrian general, finding
himself duped by the stratagem of the Prussian monarch,
and being made acquainted with his enterprise against
Dresden, instantly wheeled about, and marched back with
<PB N="270" REF="275"/>
such rapidity, that on the nineteenth day of the month
he reached the neighbourhood of the capital of Saxony.
In consequence of his approach the King of Prussia, whose
heavy artillery was now arrived, redoubled his efforts
against the city, so as to reduce to ashes the cathedral
church, the new square, several noble streets, some
palaces, together with the curious manufactory of por∣celain.
His vengeance must have been levelled against
the citizens; for it affected neither the fortifications, nor
the Austrian garrison, which Count Daun found means
to re-enforce with sixteen battalions. This supply, and
the neighbourhood of three hostile armies, rendered it
altogether impossible to prosecute the siege with any
prospect of success: the King, therefore, abandoned the
undertaking, withdrew his troops and artillery, and en∣deavoured
to bring Daun to a battle, which that general
cautiously avoided.</P>
<P>§ VII. The fate of this prince seemed now at its crisis.
Notwithstanding all the efforts of his brother Prince
Henry, the Russians were fast advancing to join Laudohn,
who had already blocked up Schweidnitz and Niess, and
their junction seemed to threaten the loss of all Silesia.
The king had nothing to oppose to superiour numbers,
but superiour activity, of which he determined to avail
himself without delay. Instead of making a feint towards
Silesia, he resolved to march thither in earnest; and for
that purpose, crossing the Elbe, encamped at Dallwitz, on
the farther bank of the river, leaving General Hulsen, with
fifteen thousand men, in the entrenched camp of Schlettow,
to maintain his footing in Saxony. On the third day of
August he began his march for Silesia, followed by Count
Daun with the grand Austrian army, while the detached
body under Lacy took post at Rechenberg, and the Impe∣rial
army encamped at Kesseldorf. Both the Prussians
and Austrians marched at the rate of one hundred miles in
five days: on the tenth the King took possession of the
camp of Lignitz; and here he seemed in danger of being
quite surrounded by the enemy, who occupied the whole
<PB N="271" REF="276"/>
ground between Parchwitz and Cossendan, an extent of
thirty miles. Count Daun's army formed the centre of
this chain, possessing the heighths of Wahlstadt and
Hochkirk: General La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dohn covered the ground be∣tween
Jeschkendorf and Coschitz: the rising grounds of
Parchwitz were secured by General Nauendorff; and
M. de Berk, who formed the left, extended his troops
beyond Cossendau. The King marched in the night of
the eleventh, with a view to turn the enemy, and reach
Jauer; but at break of day he discovered a new camp at
Prausnitz, which consisted of Lacy's detachment, just
arrived from Lauban. The Prussians immediately passed
the Katzbach, to attack this general, but he made such a
skilful disposition for a retreat towards the army of
Count Daun, that he not only baffled the endeavours of
the King to bring him to action, but, by posting himself
on the heighths of Hennerdorff, anticipated his march to
Jauer. In vain the Prussian monarch attempted next
day to turn the enemy on the side of the mountains, by
Pomsen and Jagersdorff; the roads were found impassa∣ble
to the ammunition waggons, and the King returned
to the camp at Lagnitz.</P>
<P>§ VIII. While he remained in this situation he received
advice that four-and-twenty thousand Russians, under
Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder at
Auras, where they intended to cross that river, and he
concluded the enemy had formed a design to close him in,
and attack him with their joint forces. Daun had, in∣deed,
projected a plan for surprising him in the night, and
had actually put his army in motion for that purpose;
but he was anticipated by the vigilance and good fortune
of the Prussian monarch. That Prince, reflecting that if
he should wait for his adversaries in his camp he ran the
risk of being attacked at the same time by Lacy on his
right, by Daun in his front, and by Laudohn on his
left, he altered his position, in order to disconcert their
operations; and on the fourteenth day of the month,
marched to the heighths of Psassendorff, where he formed
<PB N="272" REF="277"/>
his army in order of battle. Receiving intimation, about
two in the morning, that Laudhon was in full march, ad∣vancing
in columns, by Bennowitz, he divided his army
into two separate bodies. One of these remained on the
ground, in order to maintain the post against any attempts
that might be made by Count Daun to succour Laudohn;
and that this service might be the more effectually per∣formed,
the heighths were fortified with batteries, so ju∣diciously
disposed as to impede and over-awe the whole
Austrian army. The King, having taken this precaution,
wheeled about with sixteen battalions and thirty squa∣drons,
to fall upon Laudohn as he should advance; but
that general knew nothing of his design, until he himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
arrived at the village of Psaffendorff, about three in the
morning, when the day dawning, and a thick fog gra∣dually
dispersing, the whole detachment of the Prussian
army appeared in order of battle, in a well chosen situation
strengthened with a numerous train of artillery, placed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the best advantage. Laudohn was not a little mortifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to find himself caught in his own snare; but he had ad∣vanced
too far to recede, and, therefore, making a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of necessity, resolved to stand an engagement. With th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
view he formed his troops as well as the time, place, and
circumstance would permit; and the Prussians <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to the attack, a severe action ensued. The King ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
along the line to animate the troops, and superintended
every part of the charge, hazarding his life in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
dangerous scenes of the battle to such a degree, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
horse was killed under him, and his clothes we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
through in several places. The Austrians maintained <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lict with great obstinacy until six in the morning
when they gave ground, and were pursued to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Katzbach, beyond which the King would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
troops to prosecute the advantage they had gained, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they might be able to succour the right, in case Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal
Count Daun should succeed in his atte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
to advance against them from L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itz. That g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦neral
had actually begun his march to fall upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="273" REF="278"/>
Prussians on one side, while Laudohn should attack them
on the other; but he was not a little surprised to find they
were decamped, and when he perceived a thick cloud of
smoke at a distance, he immediately comprehended the
nature of the King's management. He then attempted to
advance by Lignitz; but the troops and artillery which
had been left on the height of Psaffendorff, to dispute his
march, were so advantageously disposed, as to render all
his efforts abortive. Laudohn is said to have lost in the
action above eight thousand men, killed, wounded, and
taken, including eighty officers, with twenty-three pair of
colours, and eighty-two pieces of cannon: over and above
this loss, the Austrian general suffered greatly by desertion.
The Prussians obtained the victory at the expense of one
general, with five hundred men killed, and twelve hun∣dred
wounded. Immediately after the action the victor
marched to Parchwitz; while Daun detached Prince
Lowenstein and General Beck, with the reserve of his
army, to join Prince Czernichew, who had crossed the
Oder at Auras; but he was so intimidated by the defeat
at Lignitz, that he forthwith repassed the river, and
Prince Lowenstein retired on the side of Jauer. By this
bold and well-conducted adventure, the Prussian monarch
not only escaped the most imminent hazard of a total de∣feat
from the joint efforts of two strong armies, but also
prevented the dreaded junction of the Russian and Austri∣an
forces. His business now was to open the communicati∣on
with Breslau and his brother Prince Henry, whom he
joined at Neumarcke. The Prince, after Laudohn was
obliged to relinquish the siege of Breslau, had kept a
watchful eye over the motions of the Russian army, which
had advanced into the neighbourhood of that city, and, with∣out
all doubt, would have bombarded it from some com∣manding
heighths, had they not been prevented by Prince
Henry, who took possession of these posts, and fortified
them with redoubts. The King, having freed Breslau
from the neighbourhood of his enemies, and being
strengthened by the junction with his brother, left a con∣siderable
<PB N="274" REF="279"/>
detachment under the command of General
Boltze, to protect the country against the Russian irre∣gulars;
and advanced with his whole force to the relief
of Schweidnitz, which was blocked up by the Austrian
army under the command of the Mareschal Count Daun.
In his march he fell upon a separate body under General
Beck, made two battalions of Croats prisoners, and dis∣persed
several squadrons. This atchievement had such an
effect upon the enemy, that they raised the blockade, and
retreated with some precipitation to the mountains of
Land shut.</P>
<P>§ IX. While the King thus exerted himself, with a
spirit altogether unexampled, in defending Silesia, General
Hulsen, who commanded his troops in Saxony, was ex∣posed
to the most imminent danger. Understanding that
the army of the empire had formed a design to cut off his
communication with Torgau, he quitted his camp at
Meissen, and marched to Strehla. The enemy having
divided their forces into two bodies, one of them, on the
twentieth day of August, attacked an advanced post of the
Prussians; while the other was disposed in such a man∣ner,
as to over-awe Hulsen's camp, and prevent him from
taking any step for the relief of his battalions, who main∣tained
their ground with difficulty against a superior num∣ber
of the assailants. In this emergency the Prussian
general ordered his cavalry to make a circuit round a ri∣sing
ground, and, if possible, charge the enemy in slank.
This order was executed with equal vigour and success.
They fell upon the Imperial army with such impetuosity,
as drove their battalions and horse upon each other in the
utmost confusion. A considerable number of the enemy
were slain, and forty-one officers, with twelve hundred
men, made prisoners. By this advantage, which was ob∣tained
at a very small expense, General Hulsen opened for
himself a way to Torgau, whither he instantly retreated,
perceiving that the whole army of the Imperialists was
advancing to cut off his communication with the Elbe.
<PB N="275" REF="280"/>
This retreat furnished the enemy with a pretext for
claiming the victory.</P>
<P>§ X. After all these heroick endeavours of the Prussian
monarch and his officers, his affairs remained in such a
desperate situation as seemed to presage approaching ruin:
for, though in person he commanded a numerous and well
appointed army, he found it absolutely impossible to guard
against the different detachments from the three separate
armies of his adversaries. Bodies of Austrian troops
scoured the country of Lusatia; the Russians traversed
part of Silesia, and made irruptions even into Branden∣burg:
the Imperial army domineered in Saxony: the
Swedish army, meeting with no opposition, advanced into
the heart of Pomerania; so that the King was not only
threatened on every side, but all correspondence between
him and his hereditary dominions was at this juncture
intercepted.</P>
<P>§ XI. His adversaries, having been hitherto baffled by
his activity and resolution in their designs upon Silesia,
now meditated a scheme, the execution of which he could
not but feel in the most sensible manner. The Russian
army being on its retreat from Silesia, Count Czernichew
was sent with a strong detachment into the Marche of
Brandenburg; while a numerous body of Austrians,
under Lacy and Bretano, penetrated into the same country
from Saxony, with instructions to join the Russians at the
gates of Berlin. The Prussian general, Hulsen, finding
himself too weak to cope with the army of the Empire in
Misnia, had fallen back to this capital, where he was
joined by the troops under General Werner, lately re∣turned
from Pomerania; but as their forces, after this
junction, did not exceed sixteen thousand men, and the
allies advancing against them amounted to forty thousand,
they would not pretend to oppose the enemy in the open
field, nor to desend a city of such extent, and so imper∣fectly
fortified. Such an attempt would have only ex∣posed
their troops to ruin, without being able to save the
capital, which, on the contrary, would have been the more
<PB N="276" REF="281"/>
severely handled, in consequence of their opposition.
They, therefore, resolved to retire, after having repulsed
the advanced guard of the Russians under Tottleben,
which attacked the gates, and even bombarded the town,
before the great armies appeared. At their approach the
Prussian generals retreated, leaving three weak battalions
in the place, in hopes they might be the means of obtain∣ing
some sort of terms for the city. They made no resist∣ance,
however, but on the first summons proposed articles
of capitulation, which being refused, they surrendered
themselves prisoners of war. In favour of the city the fo∣reign
ministers there residing interposed their mediation
with such zeal and success, that tolerable conditions were
obtained. The inhabitants were indulged with the free ex∣ercise
of their religion, and an immunity from violence to
their persons and effects. The enemy promised that the
Russian irregulars should not enter the town; and that the
King's palace should not be violated. These articles being
ratified, the Austrian and Russian troops entered the place,
where they totally destroyed the magazines, arsenals, and
founderies, with an immense quantity of military stores,
and a great number of cannon and small arms: then they
demanded the immediate payment of eight hundred thou∣sand
guilders; and afterwards exacted a contribution of
one million nine hundred thousand German crowns,
Many outrages were committed by the licentious soldiery,
in spite of all the precautions which the officers could
take to preserve the most exact discipline. The houses
of the private inhabitants were tolerably protected, but the
King's palaces were subjected to the most rigorous treat∣ment.
In the royal palace of Charlottenburg they pillaged
and spoiled the rich furniture; they defaced and mutilated
the valuable pictures and antique statues collected by Car∣dinal
de Polignac, and purchased by the house of Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣denburg.
The castle of Schonhausen, belonging to the
Queen, and that of Fredericksfeldt, the property of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Margrave Charles, were pillaged of effects to a very con¦siderable
value. The palace of Potsdam was effectually
<PB N="277" REF="282"/>
protected by Prince Esterhasi, who would not suffer one
article of furniture or ornament to be touched, but de∣sired
leave to take one picture of the King, and two of his
german slutes, that he might preserve them as memorials
of an illustrious prince, whose heroick character he ad∣mired.
The Austrian and Russian troops entered Berlin
on the ninth day of October, and quitted it on the thir∣teenth,
on hearing that the King was in full march to the
relief of his capital. In their retreat, by different routes,
from Brandenburg, they drove away all the cattle and
horses they could find, ravaged the country, and committed
brutal outrages on the inhabitants, which the pretence of
retaliation could never excuse. The body of Russians
which entered Berlin marched from thence into Poland,
by the way of Furstenwalde, while the Austrians took the
route of Saxony, from whence they had advanced into
Brandenburg. Mean while the town of Wirtemberg, in
that electorate, was reduced by the Duke de Deux Ponts,
commander of the Imperial army, which, in conjunction
with the Austrians, made themselves masters also of
Torgau and Leipsick.</P>
<P>§ XII. The King of Prussia, in his march through
Lusatia, was still attended by Count Daun, at the head of
his grand army, and both passed the Elbe about the latter
end of October. The Prussian crossed the river at Cos∣wick,
where he was joined by the troops under Prince
Eugene of Wirtemberg and General Hulsen, so that his
army now amounted to eighty thousand fighting men,
with whom he resolved to strike some stroke of import∣ance.
Indeed, at this time his situation was truely critical.
General Laudohn, with a considerable body of Austrians,
remained in Silesia; the Russian army still threatened
Breslau, the capital of that country. The Imperialists
and Austrians had taken possession of all the great towns in
Saxony, and were masters on both sides of the Elbe. In
the eastern part of Pomerania the Russians had invested
Colberg by sea and land, seemingly determined to reduce
the place, that they might have a sea-port, by which they
<PB N="278" REF="283"/>
could be supplied with provision, ammunition, necessaries,
and re-enforcements, without the trouble and inconveni∣ence
of a long and laborious march from the banks of the
Vistula. On the western side of Pomerania, the war,
which had hitherto languished, was renewed by the Swedes
with uncommon vivacity. They passed the river Pene
without opposition; and obliging General Stutterheim to
retreat, advanced as far as Stransberg. That officer,
however, being re-enforced, attacked a Swedish post at
Passelvalik, sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w about five hundred of the enemy, and
took an equal number, with six pieces of cannon; but he
was not numerous enough to keep the field against their
whole army. Thus the Prussian monarch saw himself ob∣liged
to abandon Silesia, deprived of all the places he held
in Saxony, which had been his best resource, and in danger
of being driven into his hereditary country of Branden∣burg,
which was unable either to maintain, or even to
recruit his army. On this emergency he resolved to make
one desperate effort against the grand Austrian army,
under Count Daun, who had passed the Elbe at Torgau,
and advanced to Eulenbourg, from whence, however, he
retreated to his former camp at Torgau, and the King
chose his situation between this last place and Schilda, at
Lang-Reichenbach, where his hussars attacked a body of
horse under General Brentano, and made four hundred
prisoners. The right wing of the Austrians being at
Groswich, and their left at Torgau, the Prussian King
determined to attack them next day, which was the third
of November. His design was to march through the
wood of Torgau by three different routes, with thirty bat∣talions
and fifty squadrons of his left wing: the first line
was ordered to advance by the way of Mackrene to Neiden;
the second, by Peckhutte to Elsnick; and the third, con∣sisting
of cavalry, to penetrate by the wood of Wilden∣hayn
to Vogelsang. On the other hand, General Zei∣then
was directed to take the great Leipsick road, with
thirty battalions and seventy squadrons of the right; and
quitting it at the ponds of Torgau, to attack the villages of
<PB N="279" REF="284"/>
Suptitz and Groswich. The King's line, in its march, fell
in with a corps of Austrians under General Reid, who
retired into the wood of Torgau; and another more con∣siderable
body, posted in the wood of Wildenhayn, like∣wise
retreated to Groschutz, after having fired some pieces
of artillery: but the dragoons of St. Ignon, being en∣closed
between two columns of Prussian infantry, were
either killed or taken. By two in the afternoon the King
had penetrated through the wood to the plain of Neiden,
from whence another body of the enemy retired to Tor∣gau,
where a continued noise of cannon and small arms
declared that General Zeithen was already engaged. The
Prussians immediately advanced at a quicker pace, and
passing the morasses near Neiden, inclined to the right in
three lines, and soon came to action. Daun had chosen
a very advantageous position: his right extended to
Groswich, and his left to Zinne; while his infantry oc∣cupied
some eminences along the road of Leipsick, and his
front was strengthened with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less than two hundred
pieces of cannon. His second line was disposed on an ex∣tent
of ground, which terminated in hillocks towards the
Elbe; and against this the King directed his attack.
He had already given his troops to understand, that his
affairs were in such a situation, they must either conquer
or perish; and they began the battle with the most de∣sperate
impetuosity; but they met with such a warm re∣ception
from the artillery, small arms, and in particular
from the Austrian carabiniers, that their grenadiers were
shattered and repulsed. The second charge, though en∣forced
with incredible vigour, was equally unsuccessful:
then the King ordered his cavalry to advance, and they
fell upon some regiments of infantry with such fury as
obliged them to give way. These, however, were com∣pelled
to retire, in their turn, before about seventy bat∣talions
of the enemy, who advanced towards Torgau,
stretching with their right to the Elbe, and their left
to Zinne. While the Prince of Holstein rallied his ca∣valry,
and returned to the charge, the third line of Prussian
<PB N="280" REF="285"/>
infantry attacked the vineyard of Suptitz, and Gen. Zei∣then,
with the right wing, took the enemy in rear. This
disposition threw the Austrians into disorder, which was
greatly augmented by the disaster of Count Daun, who
was dangerously wounded in the thigh, and carried off the
field of battle. But the Prussians could not pursue their
victory, because the action had lasted until nine; and the
night being unusually dark, facilitated the retreat of the
enemy, who crossed the Elbe on three bridges of boats,
thrown over the river at Torgau. The victor possessed
the field of battle, with seven thousand prisoners, in∣cluding
two hundred officers, twenty-nine pair of colours,
one standard, and about forty pieces of cannon. The car∣nage
was very great on both sides: about three thousand
Prussians were killed, and five thousand wounded; and,
in the first attacks, two general officers, with fifteen hun∣dred
soldiers, were made prisoners by the enemy. The
King, as usual, exposed his person in every part of the
battle, and a musket-ball grazed upon his breast. In the
morning the King of Prussia entered Torgau: then he
secured Meissen, and took possession of Freyberg; so that,
in consequence of this well-timed victory, his position was
nearly the same as at the opening of the campaign.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The Austrians, however, notwithstanding this
check, maintained their ground in the neighbourhood of
Dresden; while the Prussians were distributed in quarters
of cantonment in and about Leipsick and Meissen. As the
Austrian general had, after the battle, recalled his detach∣ments,
General Laudohn abandoned Landshut, which
again fell into the hands of the Prussians, and the Imperial
army was obliged to retire into Franconia. The Swedes
having penetrated a great way into Pomerania, returned
again to their winter-quarters at Stralsund; and the
Russian generals measured back their way to the Vistula:
so that the confederates gained little else in the course of
this campaign but the contributions which they raised in
Berlin, and the open country of Brandenburg. Had all
the allies been heartily bent upon crushing the Prussian
<PB N="281" REF="286"/>
monarch, one would imagine the Russians and Swedes
might have joined their forces in Pomerania, and made
good their winter-quarters in Brandenburg, where they
could have been supplied with magazines from the Baltick,
and been at hand to commence their operations in the
spring: but, in all probability, such an establishment in
the empire would have given umbrage to the Germanick
body.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The diet of Poland being assembled in the
beginning of October, the King entertained the most
sanguine hope they would take some resolution in his fa∣vour;
but the partisans of Prussia frustrated all his en∣deavours:
one of the deputies protesting against holding
a diet while there were foreign troops in the kingdom,
the assembly broke up in a tumultuous manner, even be∣fore
they had chosen a mareschal. The diet of Sweden,
which was convoked about the same period, seemed de∣termined
to proceed upon business. They elected Count
Axel Ferson their grand mareschal, in opposition to Count
Horn, by a great majority; which was an unlucky cir∣cumstance
for the Prussian interest at Stockholm, inas∣much
as the same majority obstinately persisted in opinion,
that the war should be prosecuted in the spring with re∣doubled
vigour, and the army in Germany re-enforced to
the number of at least thirty thousand fighting men. This
unfavourable circumstance made but little impression
upon the Prussian monarch, who had maintained his
ground with surprising resolution and success since the
beginning of the campaign, and now enjoyed in prospect
the benefit of winter, which he is said to have termed
his best auxiliary.</P>
<P>§ XV. The animosity which inflamed the contending
parties was not con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to the operations in war: but
broke out, as usual, in printed declarations, which the
belligerent powers diffused all over Europe. In the begin∣ning
of the season the states of the circle of Westphalia had
been required, by the Imperial court, to furnish their con∣tingent
of troops against the King of Prussia, or to com∣mute
<PB N="282" REF="287"/>
for this contingent with a sum of money. In con∣sequence
of this demand, some of the Westphalian estates
had sent deputies to confer with the assembly of the circle
of Cologn; and to these the King signified, by a decla∣ration,
dated at Munster, that as this demand of money,
instead of troops, was no less extraordinary than contrary
to the constitutions of the empire, should they comply
with it, or even continue to assist his enemies either with
troops or money, he would consider them as having
actually taken part in the war against him and his allies,
and treat them accordingly on all occasions. This inti∣mation
produced little effect in his favour. The Duke of
Mecklenbourg adhered to the opposite cause; and the
Elector of Cologn co-operated with the French in their
designs against Hanover. By way of retaliation for this
partiality, the Prussians ravaged the country of Mecklen∣bourg,
and the Hanoverians levied contributions in the
territories of Cologn. The parties thus aggrieved had
recourse to complaints and remonstrances. The Duke's
envoy at Ratisbon communicated a rescript to the Im∣perial
ministers, representing, that the Prussian troops
under General Werner and Colonel de Belling had
distressed his country in the autumn by grievous extor∣tions;
that afterwards Prince Eugene of Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>temberg,
in the service of Prussia, had demanded an exorbitant
quantity of provisions, with some millions of money, and
a great number of recruits: or, in lieu of these, that the
Duke's forces should act under the Prussian banner. He
therefore declared, that as the country of Mecklenbourg was
impoverished, and almost depopulated by these oppressions,
the Duke would find himself obliged to take measures for
the future security of his subjects, if not immediately favour∣ed
with such assistance from the court of Vienna as would
put a stop to these violent proceedings. This declaration
was, by some, considered as the prelude of his renounc∣ing
his engagements with the House of Austria. As the
Imperial court had threatened to put the Elector of Hanover
under the ban of the Empire, in consequence of the ho∣stilities
<PB N="283" REF="288"/>
which his troops had committed in the electorate
of Cologn, his resident at Ratisbon delivered to the mini∣sters
who assisted at the diet a memorial, remonstrating,
that the Emperour hath no power, singly, to subject any
prince to the ban, or declare him a rebel; and that, by
arrogating such a power, he exposed his authority to the
same contempt into which the Pope's bulls of excom∣munication
were so justly fallen. With respect to the
Elector of Cologn, he observed, that this prince was the
first who commenced hostilities, by allowing his troops to
co-operate with the French in their invasion of Hanover,
and by celebrating with rejoicings the advantages which
they had gained in that electorate: he, therefore, gave the
estates of the empire to understand, that the best way of
screening their subjects from hostile treatment would be
a strict observance of neutrality in the present disputes of
the empire.</P>
<P>§ XVI. This was a strain much more effectual among
princes and powers who are generally actuated by inte∣rested
motives, than was the repetition of complaints,
equally pathetick and unavailing, uttered by the unfortu∣nate
King of Poland, Elector of Saxony. The damage
done to his capital by the last attempt of the Prussian mo∣narch
on that city affected the old king in such a man∣ner,
that he published at Vienna an appeal to all the
powers of Europe, from the cruelty and unprecedented
outrages which distinguished the conduct of his adver∣saries
in Saxony. All Europe pitied the hard fate of
this exiled prince, and sympathised with the disasters of
his country; but, in the breasts of his enemies, reasons
of state and convenience over-ruled the suggestions of
humanity; and his friends had hitherto exerted them∣selves
in vain for the deliverance of his people.</P>
<P>§ XVII. From this detail of continental affairs, our
attention is recalled to Great-Britain, by an incident of a
very interesting nature; an account of which, however,
we shall postpone until we have recorded the success that,
in the course of this year, attended the British arms in the
<PB N="284" REF="289"/>
East-Indies. We have already observed, that Colonel
Coote, after having defeated the French general Lally
in the field, and reduced divers of the enemy's settlements
on the coast of Coromandel, at length cooped them up
within the walls of Pondicherry, the principal seat of the
French East-India company, large, populous, well fortified,
and secured with a numerous garrison, under the imme∣diate
command of their general. In the month of October
Admiral Stevens sailed from Trincomalè with all his
squadron, in order to its being refitted, except five sail of
the line, which he left under the command of Captain
Haldane, to block up Pondicherry by sea, while Mr.
Coote carried on his operations by land. By this dispo∣sition,
and the vigilance of the British officers the place
was so hampered, as to be greatly distressed for want of pro∣visions,
even before the siege could be undertaken in form;
for the rainy season rendered all regular approaches im∣practicable.
These rains being abated by the twenty-sixth
day of November, Colonel Coote directed the engineers
to pitch upon proper places for erecting batteries that
should enfilade or flank the works of the garrison, with∣out
exposing their own men to any severe fire from the
enemy. Accordingly, four batteries were constructed in
different places, so as to answer these purposes, and opened
altogether on the eighth day of December, at midnight.
Though raised at a considerable distance, they were plied
with good effect, and the besieged returned the fire with
great vivacity. This mutual cannonading continued un∣til
the twenty-ninth day of the month, when the engi∣neers
were employed in raising another battery, near
enough to effect a breach in the north-west counter-guard
and curtain. Though the approaches were retarded some
days by a violent storm, which almost ruined the works,
the damage was soon repaired: a considerable post was
taken from the enemy by assault, and afterwards regained
by the French grenadiers, through the timidity of the
sipoys by whom it was occupied. By the fifteenth day
of January, a second battery being raised within point-blank,
<PB N="285" REF="290"/>
a breach was made in the curtain: the west face
and flank of the north-west bastion were ruined, and the
guns of the enemy entirely silenced. The garrison and
inhabitants of Pondicherry were now reduced to an
extremity of famine which would admit of no hesitation.
General Lally sent a colonel, attended by the chief of
the Jesuits, and two civilians, to Mr. Coote, with propo∣sals
of surrendering the garrison prisoners of war, and de∣manding
a capitulation in behalf of the French East-India
company. On this last subject he made no reply;
but next morning took possession of the town and citadel,
where he found a great quantity of artillery, ammunition,
small arms, and military stores; then he secured the gar∣rison,
amounting to above two thousand Europeans.
Lally made a gallant defence, and, had he been properly
supplied with provisions, the conquest of the place would
not have been so easily atchieved. He certainly flattered
himself with the hope of being supplied; otherwise an
officer of his experience would have demanded a capitula∣tion
before he was reduced to the necessity of acquiescing
in any terms the besieger might have thought proper to
impose. That he spared no pains to procure supplies
appears from an intercepted letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Monsieur Raymond—the English squadron is no more, Sir—of the twelve ships they had in our road, seven are lost, crews and all; the other four <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ismasted; and no more than one frigate hath escaped—therefore, lose not an instant in sending chelingoes upon chelingoes, laden with rice—The Dutch have nothing to fear now.

to Monsieur Raymond, French resident at Pulli∣cat.—The
billet is no bad sketch of the writer's character,
which seems to have a strong tincture of oddity and ex∣travagance.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="291"/>
§ XVIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> By the reduction of Pondicherry the French
interest was annihilated on the coast of Coromandel, and
therefore of the utmost importance to the British nation.
It may be doubted, however, whether Colonel Coote,
with all his spirit, vigilance, and military talents, could
have succeeded in this enterprise without the assistance
of the squadron, which co-operated with him by sea, and
effectually excluded all succour from the besieged. It
must be owned, for the honour of the service, that no
incident interrupted the good understanding which was
maintained between the land and sea-officers, who vied
with each other in contributing their utmost efforts to∣wards
the success of the expedition. On the twenty-fifth
day of December Rear-Admiral Stevens arrived with
four ships of the line, having parted with Rear-Admiral
Cornish and his division in stormy weather: but he join∣ed
them at Pondicherry before the place was surrendered.
On the first day of January a violent tempest obliged Ad∣miral
Stevens to slip his cables and put to sea, where he
parted with the rest of his squadron; and when in three
days he returned to the road of Pondicherry, he had
the mortification to find that his division had suffered se∣verely
from the storm. The ships of war called the Duke
of Aquitaine and the Sunderland foundered in the storm,
and their crews perished. The Newcastle, the Queen∣borough,
and the Protector fireship, were driven a-shore,
and destroyed; but the men were saved, together with
the cannon, stores, and provisions. Many other ships
sustained considerable damage, which, however, was
soon repaired. Admiral Stevens having intercepted the let∣ter
from Lally to Raymond (inserted in p. 285) immediately
dispatched letters to the Dutch and Danish settlements on
this coast, intimating, that, notwithstanding the insinu∣ations
of General Lally, he had eleven sail of the line,
with two frigates, under his command, all sit for service,
in the road of Pondicherry, which was closely invested
and blockaded both by sea and land: he, therefore, de∣clared,
that as in that case it was contrary to the law of
<PB N="287" REF="292"/>
nations for any neutral power to relieve or succour the be∣sieged,
he was determined to selfe any vessel that should
attempt to throw provisions into the place.</P>
<P>§ XIX. While the arms of Great-Britain still prosper∣ed
in every effort tending to the real interest of the nation,
an event happened, which, for a moment, obscured the
splendour of her triumphs; and could not but be very
alarming to those German allies, whom her liberality had
enabled to maintain an expensive and sanguinary war of
humour and ambition. On the twenty-fifth day of Octo∣ber,
George II. King of Great-Britain, without any pre∣vious
disorder, was, in the morning, suddenly seised with
the agony of death, at the palace at Kensington. He
had risen at his usual hour, drunk his chocolate, and en∣quired
about the wind, as anxious for the arrival of the
foreign mails; then he opened a window of his apartment,
and perceiving the weather was serene, declared he would
walk in the garden. In a few minutes after this decla∣ration,
while he remained alone in the chamber, he fell
down upon the floor; the noise of his fall brought his at∣tendants
into the room, who lifted him on the bed, where
he desired, in a faint voice, that the Princess Amolia might
be called; but before she could reach the apartment he had
expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but with∣out
effect; and indeed his malady was far beyond the reach
of art; for when the cavity of the thorax or chest was
opened, and inspected by the serjeant-surgeons, they
found the right ventricle of the heart actually ruptured,
and a great quantity of blood discharged through the aper∣ture
into the surrounding pericardium; so that he must
have died instantaneously, in consequence of the effusion.
The case, however, was so extraordinary, that we question
whether there is such another instance upon record.—A
rupture of this nature appears the more remarkable, as it
happened to a prince of a healthy constitution, unaccu∣stomed
to excess, and far advanced beyond that period
of life, when the blood might be supposed to slow with
a dangerous impetuosity.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="293"/>
§ XX. Thus died George II. at the age of seventy-seven,
after a long reign of thirty-four years, distinguished
by a variety of important events, and checquered with a
viciffitude of character and fortune. He was in his person
rather lower than the middle size, well shaped, erect, with
eyes remarkably prominent, a high nose, and fair com∣plexion.
In his disposition he is said to have been hasty,
prone to anger, especially in his youth, yet soon appeased;
otherwise mild, moderate, and humane: in his way of
living temperate, regular, and so methodical in every
branch of private oeconomy, that his attention descended
to objects which a great king (perhaps) had better over∣look.
He was fond of military pomp and parade; and
personally brave. He loved war as a soldier; he studied
it as a science; and corresponded on this subject with some
of the greatest officers whom Germany has produced.
The extent of his understanding, and the splendour of
his virtue, we shall not presume to ascertain, or attempt
to display; we rather wish for opportunities to expatiate on
his munificence and liberality; his generous regard to
genius and learning; his royal encouragement and pro∣tection
of those arts by which a nation is at once bene∣fited
and adorned. With respect to his government, it
very seldom deviated from the institutions of laws; or en∣croached
upon private property; or interfered with the
common administration of justice. The circumstances
that chiefly marked his public character, were a predi∣lection
for his native country, and a close attention to
the political interests of the Germanick body: points and
principles to which he adhered with the most invincible
fortitude; and if ever the blood and treasu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Great-Britain
were sacrificed to these considerations, we ought
not so much to blame the prince, who acted from the
dictates of natural affection, as we should detest a succes∣sion
of venal ministers, all of whom in their tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s de∣voted
themselves, soul and body, to the gratification of
this passion, or partiality, so prejudicial to the true in∣terest
of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294"/>
§ XXI. The reign of George II. produced many revo∣lutions,
as well in the internal schemes of oeconomy and
administration, as in the external projects of political con∣nexions;
revolutions that exposed the frailties of human
nature, and demonstrated the instability of systems founded
upon convenience. In the course of this reign a standing
army was, by dint of ministerial influence, engrafted on
the constitution of Great-Britain. A fatal stroke was
given to the liberty of the press, by the act subjecting
all dramatick writings to the inspection of a licenser.
The great machine of corruption, contrived to secure a
constant majority in parliament, was overturned, and
the inventor of it obliged to quit the reins of government.
Professed patriots resigned the principles they had long en∣deavoured
to establish, and listed themselves for the de∣fence
of that fortress against which their zeal and talents
had been levelled. The management of a mighty king∣dom
was consigned into the hands of a motley admini∣stration,
ministers without knowledge, and men without
integrity, whose councils were timid, weak, and waver∣ing;
whose folly and extravagance exposed the nation to
ridicule and contempt; by whose ignorance and pre∣sumption
it was reduced to the verge of ruin. The
kingdom was engaged in a quarrel truely national, and
commenced a necessary war on national principles; but
that war was starved, and the chief strength of the nation
transferred to the continent of Europe, in order to main∣tain
an unnecessary war, in favour of a family whose pride
and ambition can be equalled by nothing but its insolence
and ingratitude. While the strength of the nation was
thus exerted abroad for the support of worthless allies,
and a dangerous rebellion raged in the bowels of the king∣dom,
the sovereign was insulted by his ministers, who de∣serted
his service at that critical juncture, and refused to
resume their functions, until he had truckled to their
petulant humour, and dismissed a favourite servant, of
whose superior talents they were meanly jealous. Such
an unprecedented secession at any time would have merited
<PB N="290" REF="295"/>
the imputation of insolence; but at that period, when
their sovereign was perplexed and embarrassed by a variety
of dangers and difficulties; when his crown, and even
his life, was at stake, to throw up their places, abandon
his councils, and, as far as in them lay, detach themselves
from his fortune, was a step so likely to aggravate the
disorder of the nation, so big with cruelty, ingratitude,
and sedition, that it seems to deserve an appellation which,
however, we do not think proper to bestow. An inglo∣rious
war was succeeded by an ignominious peace, which
proved of short duration; yet in this interval the English
nation exhibited such a proof of commercial opulence, as
astonished all Europe. At the close of a war which had
drained it of so much treasure, and increased the public
debt to an enormous burthen, it acquiesced under such a
reduction of interest as one would hardly think the mini∣stry
durst have proposed, even before one half of the na∣tional
debt was contracted. A much more unpopular step
was a law that passed for naturalizing the Jews—a law so
odious to the people in general, that it was soon repealed,
at the request of that minister by whom it had been chiefly
patronised. An ill-concerted peace was in a little time
productive of fresh hostilities, and another war with France,
which Britain began to prosecute under unfavourable au∣spices.
Then the whole political system of Germany was
inverted. The King of England abandoned the interest
of that house which he had in the former war so warmly
espoused, and took into his bosom a prince whom he had
formerly considered as his inveterate enemy. The unpro∣pitious
beginning of this war against France being im∣puted
to the misconduct of the administration, excited
such a ferment among the people, as seemed to threaten a
dangerous insurrection. Every part of the kingdom re∣sounded
with the voice of dissatisfaction, which did not
even respect the throne. The King found himself obliged
to accept of a minister presented by the people, and
this measure was attended with consequences as favourable
as his wish could form. From that instant all clamour
<PB N="291" REF="296"/>
was hushed; all opposition ceased. The enterprising
spirit of the new minister seemed to diffuse itself through
all the operations of the war; and conquest every where
attended the efforts of the British arms. Now appeared
the fallacy of those maxims, and the falsehood of those
assertions, by which former ministers had established and
endeavoured to excuse the practices of corruption. The
supposed disaffection, which had been insisted on as the
source of parliamentary opposition, now entirely va∣nished;
nor was it found necessary to use sinister means
for securing a majority, in order to answer the purposes
of the administration. England, for the first time, saw a
minister of state in full possession of popularity. Under
the auspices of this minister, it saw a national militia
formed, and trained to discipline by the invincible spirit
of a few patriots, who pursued this salutary measure in
the face of unwearied opposition, discouraged by the jea∣lously
of a court, and ridiculed by all the venal retainers to
a standing army. Under his ministry it saw the military
genius of Great-Britain revive, and shine with redoubled
lustre; it saw her interest and glory coincide, and an im∣mense
extent of country added by conquest to her domi∣nions.
The people, confiding in the integrity and abili∣ties
of their own minister, and elevated by the repeated
sounds of triumph, became enamoured of the war, and
granted such liberal subsidies for its support, as no other
minister would have presumed to ask, as no other nation
believed they could afford. Nor did they murmur at
seeing great part of their treasure diverted into foreign
channels; nor did they seem to bestow a serious thought
on the accumulating load of the national debt, which al∣ready
exceeded the immense sum of one hundred mil∣lions.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In a word, they were intoxicated with victory;
and as the King happened to die in the midst of their tran∣sports
occasioned by the final conquest of Canada, their
good humour garnished his character with a prodigality of
encomiums. A thousand pens were drawn to paint the
<PB N="292" REF="297"/>
beauties and sublimity of his character, in poetry as well
as prose. They extolled him above Alexander in courage
and heroism, above Augustus in liberality, Titus in
clemency, Antoninus in piety and benevolence, Solomon
in wisdom, and St. Edward in devotion. Such hyper∣bolica
eulogiums served only to throw a ridicule upon a
character, which was otherwise respectable. The two
universities vied with each other in lamenting his death,
and each published a huge collection of elegies on the
subject: nor did they fail to exalt his praise, with the
warmest expressions of affection and regret, in the com∣pliments
of condolance and congratulation which they
presented to his successor. The same panegyrick and
pathos appeared in all the addresses with which every
other community in the kingdom approached the throne
of our present sovereign; insomuch, that we may venture
to say, no prince was ever more popular at the time of his
decease. The English are naturally warm and impetu∣ous;
and, in generous natures, affection is as apt as any
other passion to run riot. The sudden death of the King
was lamented as a national misfortune by many, who
felt a truely filial affection for their country; not that
they implicitly subscribed to all the exaggerated praise
which had been so liberally poured forth on his charac∣ter;
but because the nation was deprived of him at a criti∣cal
juncture, while involved in a dangerous and expensive
war, of which he had been personally the chief mover
and support. They knew the burthen of royalty de∣volved
upon a young prince, who, though heir apparent
to the crown, and already arrived at years of maturity,
had never been admitted to any share of the administration,
nor made acquainted with any schemes or secrets of state.
The real character of the new king was very little known
to the generality of the nation. They dreaded an abrupt
change of measures, which might have rendered useless all
the advantages obtained in the course of the war. As
they were ignorant of his connexions, they dreaded a re∣volution
in the ministry, which might fill the kingdom
<PB N="293" REF="298"/>
with clamour and confusion. But the greatest shock occa∣sioned
by his decease was undoubtedly among our allies and
fellow-subjects in Germany, who saw themselves suddenly
deprived of their sole prop and patron, at a time when
they could not pretend, of themselves, to make head
against the numerous enemies by whom they were sur∣rounded.
But all these doubts and apprehensions va∣nished
like mists before the rising sun; and the people of
Great-Britain enjoyed the inexpressible pleasure of seeing
their loss repaired in such a manner as must have amply
fulfilled the most sanguine wish of every friend to his
country.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The commerce of Great-Britain continued to
increase during the whole course of this reign; but this
increase was not the effect of extraordinary encourage∣ment.
On the contrary, the necessities of government,
the growing expenses of the nation, and the continual
augmentation of the publick debt, obliged the legislature
to hamper trade with manifold and grievous impositions:
its increase, therefore, must have been owing to the natu∣ral
progress of industry and adventure extending them∣selves
to that farthest line or limit beyond which they will
not be able to advance: when the tide of traffick has
slowed to its highest mark, it will then begin to recede in
a gradual ebb, until it is shrunk within the narrow limits
of its original channel. War, which naturally impedes
the traffick of other nations, had opened new sources
to the merchants of Great-Britain: the superiority of her
naval power had crushed the navigation of France, her
great rival in commerce, so that she now supplied, on her
own terms, all those foreign markets, at which, in time of
peace, she was undersold by that dangerous competitor.
Thus her trade was augmented to a surprising pitch; and
this great augmentation alone enabled her to maintain the
war at such an enormous expense. As this advantage will
cease when the French are at liberty to re-establish their
commerce, and prosecute it without molestation, it would
be for the interest of Great-Britain to be at continual
variance with that restless neighbour, provided the con∣test
<PB N="294" REF="299"/>
could be limited to the operations of a sea-war, in
which England would be always invincible and victo∣rious.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The powers of the human mind were freely
and fully exercised in this reign. Considerable progress
was made in mathematicks and astronomy by divers indi∣viduals;
among whom we number Sanderson, Bradley,
Maclaurin, Smith, and the two Simpsons. Natural phi∣losophy
became a general study, and the new doctrine of
electricity grew into fashion. Different methods were
discovered for rendering sea-water potable and sweet; and
divers useful hints were communicated to the publick by
the learned Doctor Stephen Hales, who directed all his
researches and experiments to the benefit of society. The
study of alchemy no longer prevailed; but the art of che∣mistry
was perfectly understood, and assiduously applied
to the purposes of sophistication. The clergy of Great-Britain
were generally learned, pious, and exemplary.
Sherlock, Hoadley, Secker, and Conybeare were pro∣moted
to the first dignities of the church. Warburton,
who had long signalised himself by the strength and bold∣ness
of his genius, his extensive capacity, and profound
erudition, at length obtained the mitre. But these pro∣motions
were granted to reasons of state convenience,
and personal interest, rather than as rewards of ex∣traordinary
merit. Many other ecclesiasticks of worth
and learning were totally overlooked. Nor was eccle∣siastical
merit confined to the established church. Many
instances of extraordinary genius, unaffected piety, and
universal moderation, appeared among the dissenting mini∣sters
of Great-Britain and Ireland: among these we par∣ticularise
the elegant, the primitive Foster; the learned,
ingenious, and penetrating Leland.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The progress of reason, and free cultivation
of the human mind, had not, however, entirely banished
those ridiculous sects and schisms of which the kingdom
had been formerly so productive. Imposture and fanati∣cism
still hung upon the skirts of religion. Weak minds
<PB N="295" REF="300"/>
were seduced by the delusions of a superstition stiled Me∣thodism,
raised upon the affectation of superior sanctity,
and maintained by pretensions to divine illumination.
Many thousands in the lower ranks of life were infected
with this species of enthusiasm, by the unwearied endea∣vours
of a few obscure preachers, such as Whitfield, and
the two Westleys, who propagated their doctrines to the
most remote corners of the British dominions, and found
means to lay the whole kingdom under contribution.
Fanaticism also formed a league with false philosophy.
One Hutchinson, a visionary, intoxicated with the fumes
of Rabbinical learning, pretended to deduce all demon∣stration
from Hebrew roots, and to confine all human
knowledge to the five books of Moses. His disciples be∣came
numerous after his death. With the Methodists,
they denied the merit of good works; and bitterly inveigh∣ed
against Newton as an ignorant pretender, who had pre∣sumed
to set up his own ridiculous chimaeras in opposition
to the sacred philosophy of the Pentateuch. But the most
extraordinary sect which distinguished this reign was that
of the Moravians, or Hernhutters, imported from Ger∣many
by Count Zinzendorf, who might have been termed
the Melchizedeck of his followers, inasmuch as he as∣sumed
among them the threefold character of prophet,
priest, and king. They could not be so properly stiled a
sect, as the disciples of an original, who had invented a
new system of religion. Their chief adoration was paid
to the Second Person in the Trinity: the First they treat∣ed
with the most shocking neglect. Some of their tenets
were blasphemous, some indecent, and others ridiculously
absurd. Their discipline was a strange mixture of devo∣tion
and impurity. Their exterior worship consisted of
hymns, prayers, and sermons; the hymns extremely lu∣dicrous,
and often indecent, alluding to the side-hole or
wound which Christ received from a spear in his side
while he remained upon the cross. Their sermons fre∣quently
contained very gross incentives to the work of
propagation. Their private exercises are said to have
<PB N="296" REF="301"/>
abounded with such rites and mysteries as we cannot ex∣plain
with any regard to decorum. They professed a
community of goods, and were governed as one fami∣ly,
in temporals as well as spirituals, by a council, or
kind of presbytery, in which the count, as their ordi∣nary,
presided. In cases of doubt, or great consequence,
these pretended to consult the Saviour, and to decide from
immediate inspiration; so that they boasted of being
under the immediate direction of a Theocracy; though,
in fact, they were slaves to the most dangerous kind of
despotism: for as often as any individual of the com∣munity
pretended to think for himself, or differ in
opinion from the ordinary and his band of associates,
the oracle decreed that he should be instantly sent upon
the mission which they had fixed in Greenland, or to the
colony they had established in Pennsylvania. As these re∣ligionists
consisted chiefly of manufacturers, who appear∣ed
very sober, orderly, and industrious; and their chief
declared his intention of prosecuting works of publick
emolument, they obtained a settlement under a parlia∣mentary
sanction in England, where they soon made a
considerable number of proselytes, before their princi∣ples
were fully discovered and explained.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Many ingenious treatises on metaphy sicks and
morality appeared in the course of this reign, and a philo∣sophical
spirit of enquiry dissused itself to the farthest ex∣tremities
of the united kingdom. Though few discoveries
of importance were made in medicine, yet that art was
well understood in all its different branches, and many of
its professors distinguished themselves in other provinces of
literature. Besides the medical essays of London and
Edinburgh, the physician's library was enriched with many
useful modern productions; with the works of the classical
Friend, the elegant Mead, the accurate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uxham, and the
philosophical Pringle. The art of midwifery was eluci∣dated
by science, reduced to sixed principles, and almost
wholly consigned into the hands of men practitioners.
The researches of anatomy were prosecuted to some
curious discoveries, by the ingenuity and dexterity of a
<PB N="297" REF="302"/>
Hunter and a Monro.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV. 1760.</NOTE> The numerous hospitals in Lon∣don
contributed to the improvement of surgery, which was
brought to perfection under the auspices of a Cheselden
and a Sharpe. The advantages of agriculture, which had
long flourished in England, extended themselves gradual∣ly
to the most remote and barren provinces of the island.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. The mechanick powers were well under∣stood,
and judiciously applied to many useful machines of
necessity and convenience. The mechanical arts had
attained to all that perfection which they were capable of
acquiring; but the avarice and oppression of contractors
obliged the handicraftsman to exert his ingenuity, not in
sinishing his work well, but in affording it cheap; in pur∣chasing
bad materials, and performing his task in a hurry;
in concealing flaws, substituting show for solidity, and sa∣crificing
reputation to the thirst of lucre. Thus, many of
the English manufactures, being found slight and unser∣viceable,
grew into discredit abroad; thus the art of pro∣ducing
them more perfect may in time be totally lost at
home. The cloths now made in England are inferior in
texture and fabrick to those which were manufactured in
the beginning of the century; and the same judgment
may be pronounced upon almost every article of hard∣ware.
The razors, knives, scissars, hatchets, swords,
and other edge-utensils, prepared for exportation, are
generally ill-tempered, half finished, slawed or brittle;
and the muskets, which are sold for seven or eight shil∣lings
a-piece to the exporter, so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly and unconsci∣entiously
prepared, that they cannot be used without
imminent danger of mutilation; accordingly, one hardly
meets with a negro man upon the coast of Guinea, in
the neighbourhood of the British settlements, who has
not been wounded or maimed in some member, by the
bursting of the English fire-arms. The advantages of
this traffick, carried on at the expence of character and
humanity, will naturally cease, whenever those Africans
can be supplied more honestly by the traders of any
other nation.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="303"/>
§ XXVIII. Genius in writing spontaneously arose, and
though neglected by the great, flourished under the cul∣ture
of a publick which had pretensions to taste, and piqued
itself on encouraging literary merit. Swift and Pope we
have mentioned on another occasion. Young still sur∣vived,
a venerable monument of poetical talents. Thom∣son,
the poet of the seasons, displayed a luxuriancy of
genius in describing the beauties of nature. Akenside
and Armstrong excelled in didactick poetry. Even the
Epopoea did not disdain an English dress, but appeared to
advantage in the Leonidas of Glover, and the Epigoniad of
Wilkie. The publick acknowledged a considerable share
of dramatick merit in the tragedies of Young, Mallet,
Home, and some other less distinguished authors. Very
few regular comedies, during this period, were exhibited on
the English theatre, which, however, produced many less
laboured pieces, abounding with satire, wit, and humour.
The Careless Husband of Cibber, and Suspicious Husband
of Hoadly, are the only comedies of this age that bid fair
for reaching posterity. The exhibitions of the stage were
improved to the most exquisite entertainment by the ta∣lents
and management of Garrick, who greatly surpassed
all his predecessors of this, and perhaps every other nation,
in his genius for acting; in the sweetness and variety of
his tones; the irresistible magick of his eye; the fire and
vivacity of his action, the elegance of attitude, and the
whole pathos of expression. Quin excelled in dignity and
declamation, as well as in exhibiting some characters of
humour, equally exquisite and peculiar. Mrs. Cibber
breathed the whole soul of female tenderness and passion,
and Mrs. Pritchard displayed all the dignity of distress.
That Great-Britain was not barren of poets at this pe∣riod
appears from the detached performances of Johnson,
Mason, Gray, the two Whiteheads, and the two War∣tons,
besides a great number of other bards, who have
sported in lyrick poetry, and acquired the applause of
their fellow citizens. Candidates for literary fame appeared
even in the higher sphere of life, embellished by the ner∣vous
<PB N="299" REF="304"/>
stile, superior sense, and extensive erudition of a
Corke, by the delicate taste, the polished muse, and ten∣der
feelings of a Lyttelton. King shone unrivalled in
Roman eloquence. Even the female sex distinguished
themselves by their taste and ingenuity. Miss Carter ri∣valled
the celebrated Dacier in learning and critical know∣ledge:
Mrs. Lennox signalized herself by many success∣ful
efforts of genius, both in poetry and prose; and Miss
Reid excelled the celebrated Rosalba in portrait-painting,
both in miniature and at large, in oil, as well as in cray∣ons.
The genius of Cervantes was transfused into the
novels of Fielding, who painted the characters, and ri∣diculed
the follies of life with equal strength, humour,
and propriety. The field of history and biography was
cultivated by many writers of ability, among whom we
distinguish the copious Guthrie, the circumstantial Ralph,
the laborious Carte, the learned and elegant Robertson,
and above all the ingenious, penetrating, and compre∣hensive
Hume, whom we rank among the first writers of
the age, both as an historian and philosopher. Nor let us
forget the merit conspicuous in the works of Campbell,
remarkable for candour, intelligence, and precision.
Johnson, inferior to none in philosophy, philology, poetry,
and classical learning, stands foremost as an essayist, justly
admired for the dignity, strength, and variety of his stile,
as well as for the agreeable manner in which he investi∣gates
the human heart, tracing every interesting emotion,
and opening all the sources of morality. The laudable
aim of inlisting the passions on the side of virtue was suc∣cessfully
pursued by Richardson, in his Pamela, Clarissa,
and Grandison; a species of writing equally new and
extraordinary, where mingled with much superluity, we
find a sublime system of ethicks, an amazing knowledge
and command of human nature. Many of the Greek and
Roman classicks made their appearance in English tran∣slations,
which were favourably received as works of m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit;
among these we place, after Pope's Homer, Virgil by P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tt
and Warton, Horace by Francis, Polybius by Hamp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,
and Sophocles by Francklin. The war introduced a
<PB N="300" REF="305"/>
variety of military treatises, chiefly translated from the
French language; and a free country, like Great-Britain,
will always abound with political tracts and lucubrations.
Every literary production of merit, calculated for amuse∣ment
or instruction, that appeared in any country or lan∣guage
of Christendom was immediately imported, and
naturalised among the English people. Never was the
pursuit after knowledge so universal, or literary merit more
regarded, than at this juncture by the body of the British
nation; but it was honoured by no attention from the
throne, and little indulgence did it reap from the liberality
of particular patrons. The reign of Queen Anne was
propitious to the fortunes of Swift and Pope, who lived in
all the happy pride of independence. Young, sequestered
from courts and preferment, possessed a moderate benefice
in the country, and employed his time in a conscientious
discharge of his ecclesiastical functions. Thomson, with
the most benevolent heart that ever warmed the human
breast, maintained a perpetual war with the difficulties of
a narrow fortune. He enjoyed a place in Chancery by the
bounty of Lord Talbot, of which he was divested by the
succeeding chancellor. He afterwards enjoyed a small
pension from Frederick Prince of Wales, which was
withdrawn in the sequel. About two years before his
death, he obtained, by the interest of his friend Lord
Lyttelton, a comfortable place; but he did not live to
taste the blessing of easy circumstances, and died in debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However he was neglected when living, his memory has been honoured with peculiar marks of publick regard, in an ample subscription for a new edition of his work<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the profit a to be employed in erecting a monument in his same in Westminster-Abbey; a subscription to which his present Majesty King George III. has liberally contributed. The remaining surplus was dis∣tributed among his poor relations.</NOTE>
None of the rest whom we have named enjoyed any share
of the royal bounty, except W. Whitehead, who suc∣ceeded
to the place of laureat at the death of Cibber; and
some of them, whose merit was the most universally ac∣knowledged,
remained exposed to all the storms of indi∣gence,
and all the stings of mortification. While the
<PB N="301" REF="306"/>
Queen lived, some countenance was given to learning.
She conversed with Newton, and corresponded with Leib∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitz.
She took pains to acquire popularity: the royal fa∣mily,
on certain days, dined in publick, for the satisfaction
of the people: the court was animated with a freedom of
spirit and vivacity, which rendered it at once brilliant and
agreeable. At her death that spirit began to languish, and
a total stagnation of gaiety and good-humour ensued. It
was succeeded by a fullen calm, an ungracious reserve,
and a still rotation of insipid forms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">George <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. by his Queen Caro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, had two sons and five daughters who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the age of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>§ XXIX. England was not defective in other arts that
embellish and amuse. Musick became a fashionable study,
and its professors were generally caressed by the publick.
An Italian opera was maintained at a great expense, and
well supplied with foreign p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>formers. Private concerts
were instituted in every corner of the metropolis. The
compositions of Handel were universally admired, and he
himself lived in affluence. It must be owned at the same
time, that Geminiani was neglected, though his genius
commanded esteem and veneration. Among the few
natives of England who distinguished themselves by their
talents in this art, Green, Howard, Arne, and Boyce,
were the most remarkable.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The British soil, which had hitherto been
barren in the article of painting, now produced some ar∣tists
of extraordinary merit. Hogarth excelled all the
world in exhibiting the scenes of ordinary life; in hu∣mour,
character, and expression. Hayman became emi∣nent

and Ram<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay distinguished themselves by their su∣perior
merit in portraits; a branch that was successfully

for race-horses; Lambert, and the Smiths, for land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

made in the sublime parts of painting. Essays of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
kind were discouraged by a false taste, founded upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
reprobation of British genius. The art of engraving wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
brought to perfection by Strange, and laudably practised
by Grignion, Baron, Ravenet, and several other masters
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great improvements were made in mezzotinto, miniature,
and enamel. Many fair monuments of sculpture o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
statuary were raised by Rysbrach, Roubilliac, and Wil∣ton.
Architecture, which had been cherished by the ele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gant
taste of a Burlington, soon became a favourite study
and many magnificent edifices were reared in different parts
of the kingdom. Ornaments were carved in wood, and
moulded in stucco, with all the delicacy of execution, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a passion for novelty had introduced into gradening<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
building, and furniture, an absurd Chinese taste, equally
void of beauty and convenience. Improvements in the
liberal and useful arts will doubtless be the consequence o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that encouragement given to merit by the society instituted
for these purposes which we have described on another
occasion. As for the Royal Society, it seems to have de∣generated
in its researches, and to have had very little
share, for half a century at least, in extending the influ∣ence
of true philosophy.</P>
