<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. S—R,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Enclosed Memorial you are Charg'd with, in the behalf of many Thousands of the good People of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There is neither <HI>Popish, Jacobite, Seditious, Court,</HI> or <HI>Party Interest</HI> concern'd in it; but Honesty and Truth.</P>
<P>You are Commanded by Two Hundred Thousand <HI>English∣men,</HI> to Deliver it to the H—e of C—s, and to in∣form them that it is no Banter, but Serious Truth; and a Serious regard to it is Expected; nothing but Justice, and their Duty is requir'd, and it is requir'd by them who have both a Right to Require, and Power to Compell. <HI>viz.</HI> the People of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We could have come to the House Strong enough to Oblige them to hear us, but we have avoided any Tumults, not desiring to Embroil, but to Save our Native Country.</P>
<P>If you refuse to Communicate it to them, you will find cause in a short time to Repent it.</P>
<P>To <HI>R—t H—y</HI> Esq; S—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the H—e of C—s,</P>

<HEAD>The MEMORIAL.</HEAD>
<P>To the K—s, C—s, and B—s in P—t Assembled.</P>
<P>A Memorial,</P>
<P>From the Gentlemen, Free-holders and Inhabitants of the Counties of—in the behalf of themselves, and
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
many Thousands of the good People of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It were to be wish'd you were Men of that Temper, and possess'd of so much Honour, as to bear with the Truth, tho it be against you: Especially from us who have so much Right to tell it you; but since, Even Pe∣titions to you from your Masters, (for such are the Peo∣ple who Chose you) are so Haughtily receiv'd, as with the Committing the Authors to Illegal Custody; you must give us leave to give you this fair Notice of your Mis behaviour, without Exposing our Names.</P>
<P>If you think fit to rectifie your Errors, you will do well, and possibly may hear no more of us; but if not, assure your selves the Nation will not long hide their Resentments. And tho there are no stated Proceedings to bring you to your Duty, yet the great Law of Rea∣son says, and all Nations allow, that what ever Power is above Law, is Burthensom, and Tyrannical; and may be reduc'd by <HI>Extrajudicial</HI> Methods: You are not above the Peoples Resentments, they that made you Mem∣bers, may reduce you to the same rank from whence they chose you; and may give you a Taste of their abused kindness, in Terms you may not be pleas'd with.</P>
<P>When the People of <HI>England</HI> Assembl'd in Conven∣tion, Presented the Crown to his present Majesty, they annexed a Declaration of the Rights of the People, in which was Express'd what was Illegal and Arbitrary in the former Reign, and what was claim'd as of Right to be done by Succeeding Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, here follows, Gentlemen, a short abridgment of the Nations Grievances, and of your Il∣legal, and Unwarrantable Practices; and a Claim of Right which we make in the Name of our Selves, and such of the good People of <HI>England,</HI> as are justly Al∣larum'd at your Proceedings.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
I. To Raise Funds for Money, and Declare by bor∣rowing Clauses, that whosoever Advances Money on those Funds, shall be Re imburs'd out of the next Aids, if the Funds fall short; and then give Subsequent Funds, without Transferring the Deficiency of the former, is a horrible Cheat on the Subject who lent the Money; a Breach of Publique Faith, and destructive to the Ho∣nour and Credit of Parliaments.</P>
<P N="2">II. To Imprison Men who are not your own Members, by no proceedings but a Vote of your House, and to continue them in Custody <HI>Sine Die</HI> is Illegal; a Noto∣rious Breach of the Liberty of the People; Setting up a Dispensing Power in the House of Commons, which your Fathers never pretended to; bidding defiance to the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which is the Bulwark of Per∣sonal Liberty, Destructive of the Laws, and Betraying the Trust repos'd in you. <HI>The King at the same time being obliged to ask you Leave to continue in Custody the Horrid Assassinators of His Person.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Committing to Custody those Gentlemen, who at the Command of the People (whose Servants you are) and in a Peaceable way put you in mind of your Duty, is Illegal and Injurious; Destructive of the Sub∣jects Liberty of Petitioning for Redress of Grievances, which has by all Parliaments before you, been acknow∣ledged to be their undoubted Right.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Voting a Petition from the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> Insolent; is Ridiculous and Impertinent, because the Free-holders of <HI>England</HI> are your Superiours; and is a contradiction in it Self, and a Contempt of the <HI>English</HI> Freedom, and contrary to the Nature of Parliamentary Power.</P>
<P N="5">V. Voting People Guilty of Bribery and Ill Practices, and Committing them as aforesaid, without Bail, and then upon submission and kneeling to your House, dis∣charging
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
them; Exacting Exorbitant Fees by your Officers, is Illegal, Betraying the Justice of the Nation, Selling the Liberty of the Subject, encouraging the Ex∣tortion and Villany of Gaolers and Officers; and discon∣tinuing the Legal Prosecutions of Offenders, in the or∣dinary Course of Law.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Prosecuting the Crime of Bribery in some to serve a Party, and then proceed no further, tho proof lay before you, is Partial and Unjust; and a Scandal upon the Honour of Parliaments.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Voting the Treaty of Partition Fatal to <HI>Europe,</HI> because it gave so much of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions to the <HI>French,</HI> and not concern your selves to prevent their taking Possession of it all. Deserting the <HI>Dutch</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> are at their Doors, till it be almost too late to help them; is Uujust to our Treaties, and unkind to our Confederates; Dishonourable to the <HI>English</HI> Na∣tion, and shews you very negligent of the Safety of <HI>England,</HI> and of our Protestant Neighbours.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Ordering immediate hearings to trifling Pe∣titions, to please parties in Elections; and <HI>Postpone</HI> the Petition of a Widow for the Blood of her Murthered Daughter, without giving it a reading; is an Illegal delay of Justice, dishonourable to the Publique Justice of the Nation.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Addressing the King to displace His Friends up∣on bare Surmises, before any Legal Tryal or Article prov'd; is Illegal, an Inverting the Law, and making Execution go before Judgment; contrary to the true sence of the Law, which esteems every Man a good Man till something appears to the contrary.</P>
<P N="10">X. Delaying proceedings upon Capital Impeach∣ments, to blast the reputation of the Persons, without proving the Fact; is Illegal and Oppressive, destructive
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
of the Liberty of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> a delay of Justice, and a reproach to Parliaments.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Suffering Sawcy and inde cent Reproaches upon His Majesties Person, to be publiquely made in your House; particularly by that Impudent Scandal of Par∣liaments <HI>J—n H—w,</HI> without shewing such resent∣ments as you ought to do. The said <HI>H—w</HI> saying openly, <Q>“”That His Majesty had made a Felonious Treaty to rob his Neighbours; insinuating that the Partition Treaty (which was every way as just as blow∣ing up one Mans House to save another) was a Combi∣nation of the King to rob the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> of its due;</Q> this is making a <HI>Billingsgate</HI> of the House, and setting up to <HI>Bully</HI> your Soveraign, contrary to the intent and mea∣ning of that freedom of Speech which you claim as a a Right; is scandalous to Parliaments; Undutiful and Unmannerly, and a Reproach to the whole Nation.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Your S—r Exacting the Exorbitant rate of 10 <HI>l. per Diem</HI> for the V—s, and giving the Printer in∣couragement to raise it on the People, by selling them at 4 <HI>d. per</HI> Sheet; is an Illegal, and Arbitrary exaction, dishonourable to the House, and burthensome to the People.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>XIII.</HI> Neglecting still to pay the Nations Debts, Com∣pounding for Interest, and <HI>Postponing</HI> Petitions; is Illegal, Dishonourable, and destructive of the Publique Faith.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV.</HI> Publiquely neglecting the great work of Re∣formation of Manners; though often press'd to it by the King; to the great dishonour of God, and encourage∣ment of Vice, is a neglect of your Duty, and an abuse of the Trust repos'd in you, by God, His Majesty and the People.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV.</HI> Being Scandalously Vitious your selves, both in your Morals and Religion; Lewd in Life, and Er∣roneous in Doctrine, having publique Blasphemers and
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Impudent denyers of the Divinity of our Saviour a∣mong you, and suffering them unreproved and unpu∣nished, to the infinite regret of all good Christians, and the Just abhorrence of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in the sad prospect of the impending ruine of our Native Countrey, while Parliaments (which ought to be the Security and Defence of our Laws and Constitution) betray their Trust, and abuse the People whom they should protect, and no other way being left us but <HI>That</HI> Force which we are very loath to make use of, that Posterity may know we did not insensibly fall under the Tyranny of a prevailing Party, We do hereby</P>
<P>Claim and declare,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is the undoubted Right of the People of <HI>England,</HI> in case their Representatives in Parliament do not proceed according to their Duty and the Peoples Interest, to inform them of their Dislike, disown their Actions, and to direct them to such things as they think fit, either by Petition, Address, Proposal, Me∣morial, or any other peaceable way.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the House of Commons, separately and otherwise than by Bill Legally pass'd into an Act, have no Legal power to suspend or dispense with the Laws of the Land, any more than the King has by his Pre∣rogative.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the House of Commons have no legal Pow∣er to imprison any person, or commit them to custody of Serjeants or otherwise, (their own Members ex∣cepted) but ought to address the King, to cause any person on good Grounds to be apprehended, which person so apprehended, ought to have the Benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, and be fairly brought to Tryal by due Course of Law.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if the House of Commons, in breach of the
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Laws and Liberties of the People do betray the Trust reposed in them, and act Negligently or Arbitrarily, and Illegally, it is the undoubted Right of the People of <HI>England</HI> to call them to an account for the same, and by Convention, Assembly or Force may proceed against them as Traytors, and Betrayers of their Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>These things we think proper to declare, as the un∣questioned Right of the People of <HI>England,</HI> whom you serve, and in pursuance of that Right (avoiding the Ceremony of Petitioning our Inferiours, for such you are by your present Circumstances, as the person <HI>sent</HI> is Less than the <HI>Sender)</HI> We do publickly protest against all your foresaid Illegal Actions, and in the Name of our selves, and of all the good People of <HI>England,</HI> do</P>
<P>Require <HI>and</HI> Demand</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the publique Just Debts of the Nation be forthwith payd and discharged.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all persons illegally imprisoned as aforesaid, be either immediately discharged, or admitted to Bail, as by Law they ought to be; and the Liberty of the Subject Recogniz'd and restor'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>J—n H—w</HI> aforesaid be obliged to ask His Majesties Pardon for his Vile reflections, or be immedi∣ately expell'd the House.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the growing Power of <HI>France</HI> be taken into consideration; the Succession of the Emperour to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> supported; our Protestant Neigh∣bours protected, as the true Interest of <HI>England,</HI> and the Protestant Religion requires.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>French</HI> King be obliged to quit <HI>Flanders,</HI> or that His Majesty be address'd to declare War against him.</P>
<P N="6">6. That Suitable Supplyes be granted to His Ma∣jesty
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
for the putting all these necessary things in execu∣tion, and that care be taken that such Taxes as are raised, may be more equally Assessed and Collected, and scandalous Deficiencies prevented.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the thanks of the House may be given to those Gentlemen who so gallantly appear'd in the be∣half of their Country, with the <HI>Kentish</HI> Petition, and have been so scandalously used for it.</P>
<P>Thus Gentlemen you have your duty laid before you, which 'tis hoped you will think of; but if you continue to neglect it, you may expect to be treated according to the resentments of an injur'd Nation; for <HI>Englishmen</HI> are no more to be Slaves to Parliaments, than to a King.</P>
