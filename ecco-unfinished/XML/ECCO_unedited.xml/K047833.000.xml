<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the number of Books
composed for the use of Children;
though there are many, and some on
a very rational plan, which unfold
the system, and give a summary of
the doctrines of religion; it would
be difficult to find <HI>one</HI> calculated to
assist them in the devotional part of
it, except indeed <HI>Dr. Watts' Hymns
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
for Children.</HI> These are in pretty
general use, and the author is de∣servedly
honoured for the condescen∣sion
of his Muse, which was very
able to take a loftier flight. But it
may well be doubted, whether poetry
<HI>ought</HI> to be lowered to the capacities
of children, or whether they should
not rather be kept from reading
verse, till they are able to relish good
verse: for the very essence of poetry
is an elevation in thought and style
above the common standard; and if
it wants this character, it wants all
that renders it valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
The Author of these Hymns has
therefore chosen to give them in
prose. They are intended to be com∣mitted
to memory, and recited. And
it will probably be found, that the
measured prose in which such pieces
are generally written, is nearly as
agreeable to the ear as a more re∣gular
rhythmus. Many of these
Hymns are composed in alternate
parts, which will give them some∣thing
of the spirit of social worship.</P>
<P>The peculiar design of this publi∣cation
is, to impress devotional feel∣ings
as early as possible on the infant
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
mind; fully convinced as the author
is, that they cannot be impressed too
soon, and that a child, to feel the
full force of the idea of God, ought
never to remember the time when he
had no such idea—to impress them
by connecting religion with a variety
of sensible objects; with all that he
sees, all he hears, all that affects
his young mind with wonder or de∣light;
and thus by deep, strong, and
permanent associations, to lay the best
foundation for practical devotion in
future life. For he who has early
been accustomed to see the Creator in
the visible appearances of all around
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
him, to feel his continual presence,
and lean upon his daily protection—
though his religious ideas may be
mixed with many improprieties, which
his correcter reason will refine away—has
made large advances towards
that habitual piety, without which
religion can scarcely regulate the
conduct, and will never warm the
heart.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN I.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us praise
God, for he is exceed∣ing
great; let us bless God,
for he is very good.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
He made all things; the
sun to rule the day, the moon
to shine by night.</P>
<P>He made the great whale,
and the elephant; and the
little worm that crawleth on
the ground.</P>
<P>The little birds sing praises
to God, when they warble
sweetly in the green shade.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
The brooks and rivers praise
God, when they murmur me∣lodiously
amongst the smooth
pebbles.</P>
<P>I will praise God with my
voice; for I may praise him,
though I am but a little child.</P>
<P>A few years ago, and I
was a little infant, and my
tongue was dumb within my
mouth:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
And I did not know the
great name of God, for my
reason was not come unto me.</P>
<P>But now I can speak, and
my tongue shall praise him;
I can think of all his kind∣ness,
and my heart shall love
him.</P>
<P>Let him call me, and I
will come unto him: let
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
him command, and I will
obey him.</P>
<P>When I am older, I will
praise him better; and I will
never forget God, so long as
my life remaineth in me.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>HYMN II.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us go forth
into the fields, let us
see how the flowers spring,
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
let us listen to the warbling
of the birds, and sport our∣selves
upon the new grass.</P>
<P>The winter is over and
gone, the buds come out
upon the trees, the crimson
blossoms of the peach and
the nectarine are seen, and
the green leaves sprout.</P>
<P>The hedges are bordered
with tufts of primroses, and
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
yellow cowslips that hang
down their heads; and the
blue violet lies hid beneath
the shade.</P>
<P>The young goslings are
running upon the green, they
are just hatched, their bodies
are covered with yellow down;
the old ones hiss with anger
if any one comes near.</P>
<P>The hen sits upon her
nest of straw, she watches
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
patiently the full time, then
she carefully breaks the shell,
and the young chickens come
out.</P>
<P>The lambs just dropt are
in the field, they totter by
the side of their dams, their
young limbs can hardly sup∣port
their weight.</P>
<P>If you fall, little lambs,
you will not be hurt; there
is spread under you a carpet
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
of soft grass, it is spread on
purpose to receive you.</P>
<P>The butterflies flutter from
bush to bush, and open their
wings to the warm sun.</P>
<P>The young animals of every
kind are sporting about, they
feel themselves happy, they
are glad to be alive,—they
thank him that has made
them alive.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<P>They may thank him in
their hearts, but we can
thank him with our tongues;
we are better than they, and
can praise him better.</P>
<P>The birds can warble, and
the young lambs can bleat;
but we can open our lips in
his praise, we can speak of
all his goodness.</P>
<P>Therefore we will thank
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
him for ourselves, and we
will thank him for those that
cannot speak.</P>
<P>Trees that blossom, and
little lambs that skip about,
if you could, you would say
how good he is; but you
are dumb, we will say it for
you.</P>
<P>We will not offer you in
sacrifice, but we will offer
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
sacrifice for you, on every
hill, and in every green field,
we will offer the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and the incense
of praise.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>HYMN III.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD the Shepherd
of the flock, he taketh
care for his sheep, he lead∣eth
them among clear brooks,
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
he guideth them to fresh
pasture; if the young lambs
are weary, he carrieth them
in his arms; if they wander,
he bringeth them back.</P>
<P>But who is the shepherd's
shepherd? who taketh care
for him? who guideth him
in the path he should go?
and if he wander, who shall
bring him back?</P>
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
<P>God is the shepherd's shep∣herd.
He is the Shepherd over
all; he taketh care for all; the
whole earth is his fold: we
are all his flock; and every
herb, and every green field
is the pasture which he hath
prepared for us.</P>
<P>The mother loveth her
little child; she bringeth it
up on her knees; she nourish∣eth
its body with food; she
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
feedeth its mind with know∣ledge:
if it is sick, she
nurseth it with tender love;
she watcheth over it when
asleep; she forgetteth it not
for a moment; she teacheth
it how to be good; she re∣joiceth
daily in its growth.</P>
<P>But who is the parent of
the mother? who nourisheth
her with good things, and
watcheth over her with ten∣der
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
love, and remembereth
her every moment? Whose
arms are about her to guard
her from harm? and if she is
sick, who shall heal her.</P>
<P>God is the parent of the
mother; he is the parent of
all, for he created all. All
the men, and all the women
who are alive in the wide
world, are his children; he
loveth all, he is good to all.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
<P>The king governeth his
people; he hath a golden
crown upon his head, and the
royal sceptre is in his hand;
he sitteth upon a throne, and
sendeth forth his commands;
his subjects fear before him;
if they do well, he protecteth
them from danger; and if
they do evil, he punisheth
them.</P>
<P>But who is the sovereign
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
of the king? who command∣eth
him what he must do?
whose hand is stretched out
to protect him from danger?
and if he doeth evil, who
shall punish him?</P>
<P>God is the sovereign of the
king; his crown is of rays of
light, and his throne is
amongst the stars. He is
King of kings, and Lord of
lords: if he biddeth us live,
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
we live; and if he biddeth
us die, we die: his dominion
is over all worlds, and the
light of his countenance is
upon all his works.</P>
<P>God is our Shepherd, there∣fore
we will follow him:
God is our Father, therefore
we will love him: God is
our King, therefore we will
obey him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
<HEAD>HYMN IV.</HEAD>
<P>COME, and I will shew
you what is beautiful.
It is a rose fully blown. See
how she sits upon her mossy
stem, like the queen of all the
flowers! her leaves glow like
fire; the air is filled with her
sweet odour; she is the de∣light
of every eye.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
<P>She is beautiful, but there
is a fairer than she. He that
made the rose, is more beau∣tiful
than the rose: he is all
lovely; he is the delight of
every heart.</P>
<P>I will shew you what is
strong. The lion is strong;
when he raiseth up himself
from his lair, when he
shaketh his mane, when the
voice of his roaring is heard,
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
the cattle of the field fly,
and the wild beasts of the
desart hide themselves, for
he is very terrible.</P>
<P>The lion is strong, but he
that made the lion is stronger
than he: his anger is terri∣ble;
he could make us die in
a moment, and no one could
save us out of his hand.</P>
<P>I will shew you what is
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
glorious. The sun is glori∣ous.
When he shineth in the
clear sky, when he sitteth on
his bright throne in the hea∣vens,
and looketh abroad over
all the earth, he is the most
excellent and glorious crea∣ture
the eye can behold.</P>
<P>The sun is glorious, but
he that made the sun is more
glorious than he. The eye
beholdeth him not, for his
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
brightness is more dazzling
than we could bear. He
seeth in all dark places; by
night as well as by day; and
the light of his countenance
is over all his works.</P>
<P>Who is this great name,
and what is he called, that
my lips may praise him?</P>
<P>This great name is GOD.
He made all things, but he is
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
himself more excellent than
all which he hath made:
they are beautiful, but he is
beauty; they are strong, but
he is strength; they are per∣fect,
but he is perfection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>HYMN V.</HEAD>
<P>THE glorious sun is set
in the west; the night-dews
fall; and the air which
was sultry, becomes cool.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
<P>The flowers fold up their
coloured leaves; they fold
themselves up, and hang their
heads on the slender stalk.</P>
<P>The chickens are gathered
under the wing of the hen,
and are at rest: the hen her∣self
is at rest also.</P>
<P>The little birds have
ceased their warbling; they
are asleep on the boughs,
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
each one with his head be∣hind
his wing.</P>
<P>There is no murmur of
bees around the hive, or
amongst the honeyed wood-bines;
they have done their
work, and lie close in their
waxen cells.</P>
<P>The sheep rest upon their
soft fleeces, and their loud
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
bleating is no more heard
amongst the hills.</P>
<P>There is no sound of a
number of voices, or of chil∣dren
at play, or the tramp∣ling
of busy feet, and of peo∣ple
hurrying to and fro.</P>
<P>The smith's hammer is not
heard upon the anvil; nor
the harsh saw of the car∣penter.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
<P>All men are stretched on
their quiet beds; and the
child sleeps upon the breast
of its mother.</P>
<P>Darkness is spread over the
skies, and darkness is upon
the ground; every eye is shut,
and every hand is still.</P>
<P>Who taketh care of all
people when they are sunk
in sleep; when they cannot
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
defend themselves, nor see if
danger approacheth?</P>
<P>There is an eye that never
sleepeth; there is an eye that
seeth in dark night, as well
as in the bright sun-shine.</P>
<P>When there is no light of
the sun, nor of the moon;
when there is no lamp in the
house, nor any little star
twinkling through the thick
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
clouds; that eye seeth every
where, in all places, and
watcheth continually over all
the families of the earth.</P>
<P>The eye that sleepeth not
is God's; his hand is always
stretched out over us.</P>
<P>He made sleep to refresh
us when we are weary: he
made night, that we might
sleep in quiet.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
<P>As the mother moveth
about the house with her
finger on her lips, and stilleth
every little noise, that her
infant be not disturbed; as
she draweth the curtains
around its bed, and shutteth
out the light from its tender
eyes; so God draweth the
curtains of darkness around
us; so he maketh all things
to be hushed and still, that
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
his large family may sleep in
peace.</P>
<P>Labourers spent with toil,
and young children, and every
little humming insect, sleep
quietly, for God watcheth
over you.</P>
<P>You may sleep, for he
never sleeps: you may close
your eyes in safety, for his
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
eye is always open to protect
you.</P>
<P>When the darkness is pas∣sed
away, and the beams of the
morning-sun strike through
your eye-lids, begin the day
with praising God, who hath
taken care of you through the
night.</P>
<P>Flowers, when you open
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
again, spread your leaves, and
smell sweet to his praise.</P>
<P>Birds, when you awake,
warble your thanks amongst
the green boughs; sing to
him, before you sing to your
mates.</P>
<P>Let his praise be in our
hearts, when we lie down;
let his praise be on our lips,
when we awake.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN VI.</HEAD>
<P>CHILD of reason, whence
comest thou? What has
thine eye observed, and whi∣ther
has thy foot been wan∣dering?</P>
<P>I have been wandering
along the meadows, in the
thick grass; the cattle were
feeding around me, or re∣posing
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
in the cool shade; the
corn sprung up in the fur∣rows;
the poppy and the hare-bell
grew among the wheat;
the fields were bright with
summer, and glowing with
beauty.</P>
<P>Didst thou see nothing
more? Didst thou observe
nothing beside? Return again,
child of reason, for there are
greater things than these.
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
—God was among the fields;
and didst thou not perceive
him? his beauty was upon
the meadows; his smile en∣livened
the sun-shine.</P>
<P>I have walked through the
thick forest; the wind whis∣pered
among the trees; the
brook fell from the rocks with
a pleasant murmur; the
squirrel leapt from bough to
bough; and the birds sung
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
to each other amongst the
branches.</P>
<P>Didst thou hear nothing,
but the murmur of the brook?
no whispers, but the whis∣pers
of the wind? Return
again, child of reason, for
there are greater things than
these.—God was amongst the
trees; his voice sounded in
the murmur of the water;
his music warbled in the
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
shade; and didst thou not
attend?</P>
<P>I saw the moon rising be∣hind
the trees: it was like a
lamp of gold. The stars one
after another appeared in the
clear firmament. Presently
I saw black clouds arise, and
roll towards the south; the
lightning streamed in thick
flashes over the sky; the
thunder growled at a distance;
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
it came nearer, and I felt
afraid, for it was loud and
terrible.</P>
<P>Did thy heart feel no ter∣ror,
but of the thunderbolt?
Was there nothing bright and
terrible, but the lightning?
Return, O child of reason,
for there are greater things
than these.—God was in the
storm, and didst thou not
perceive him? His ter∣rors
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
were abroad, and did
not thine heart acknowledge
him?</P>
<P>God is in every place; he
speaks in every sound we hear;
he is seen in all that our eyes
behold: nothing, O child
of reason, is without God;—let
God therefore be in all
thy thoughts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7">
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
<HEAD>HYMN VII.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us go into
the thick shade, for it
is the noon of day, and the
summer sun beats hot upon
our heads.</P>
<P>The shade is pleasant, and
cool; the branches meet
above our heads, and shut
out the sun, as with a green
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
curtain; the grass is soft to
our feet, and a clear brook
washes the roots of the trees.</P>
<P>The sloping bank is co∣vered
with flowers: let us
lie down upon it; let us
throw our limbs on the fresh
grass, and sleep; for all
things are still, and we are
quite alone.</P>
<P>The cattle can lie down
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
to sleep in the cool shade,
but we can do what is bet∣ter;
we can raise our voices
to heaven; we can praise
the great God who made us.
He made the warm sun, and
the cool shade; the trees that
grow upwards, and the brooks
that run murmuring along.
All the things that we see are
his work.</P>
<P>Can we raise our voices up
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
to the high heaven? can we
make him hear who is above
the stars? We need not raise
our voices to the stars, for he
heareth us when we only
whisper; when we breathe
out words softly with a low
voice. He that filleth the
heavens is here also.</P>
<P>May we that are so young,
speak to him that always was?
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
May we that can hardly
speak plain, speak to God?</P>
<P>We that are so young, are
but lately made alive; there∣fore
we should not forget his
forming hand, who hath made
us alive. We that cannot speak
plain, should lisp out praises
to him who teacheth us how
to speak, and hath opened
our dumb lips.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
<P>When we could not think
of him, he thought of us;
before we could ask him to
bless us, he had already given
us many blessings.</P>
<P>He fashioneth our tender
limbs, and causeth them to
grow; he maketh us strong,
and tall, and nimble.</P>
<P>Every day we are more
active than the former day,
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
therefore every day we ought
to praise him better than the
former day.</P>
<P>The buds spread into leaves,
and the blossoms swell to
fruit; but they know not
how they grow, nor who
caused them to spring up
from the bosom of the earth.</P>
<P>Ask them, if they will tell
thee; bid them break forth
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
into singing, and fill the air
with pleasant sounds.</P>
<P>They smell sweet; they
look beautiful; but they are
quite silent: no sound is in
the still air; no murmur
of voices amongst the green
leaves.</P>
<P>The plants and the trees
are made to give fruit to man;
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
but man is made to praise
God who made him.</P>
<P>We love to praise him, be∣cause
he loveth to bless us;
we thank him for life, be∣cause
it is a pleasant thing to
be alive.</P>
<P>We love God, who hath
created all beings; we love
all beings, because they are
the creatures of God.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
<P>We cannot be good, as
God is good, to all persons
every where; but we can re∣joice,
that every where there
is a God to do them good.</P>
<P>We will think of God
when we play, and when we
work; when we walk out,
and when we come in; when
we sleep, and we wake,
his praise shall dwell conti∣nually
upon our lips.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN VIII.</HEAD>
<P>SEE where stands the cot∣tage
of the labourer,
covered with warm thatch;
the mother is spinning at the
door; the young children
sport before her on the grass;
the elder ones learn to labour,
and are obedient; the father
worketh to provide them
food: either he tilleth the
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
ground, or he gathereth in the
corn, or shaketh his ripe apples
from the tree: his children run
to meet him when he cometh
home, and his wife prepareth
the wholesome meal.</P>
<P>The father, the mother,
and the children, make a fa∣mily;
the father is the master
thereof. If the family is nu∣merous,
and the grounds
large, there are servants to
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
help to do the work: all
these dwell in one house;
they sleep beneath one roof;
they eat of the same bread;
they kneel down together and
praise God every night and
every morning with one
voice; they are very closely
united, and are dearer to each
other than any strangers. If
one is sick, they mourn to∣gether;
and if one is happy,
they rejoice together.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
<P>Many houses are built to∣gether;
many families live
near one another; they meet
together on the green, and in
pleasant walks, and to buy
and sell, and in the house of
justice; and the sound of the
bell calleth them to the house
of God, in company. If one
is poor, his neighbour help∣eth
him; if he is sad, he com∣forteth
him. This is a vil∣lage;
see where it stands en∣closed
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
in a green shade, and
the tall spire peeps above the
trees. If there be very
many houses, it is a town—it
is governed by a magistrate.</P>
<P>Many towns, and a large ex∣tent
of country, make a king∣dom:
it is enclosed by moun∣tains;
it is divided by rivers;
it is washed by seas; the in∣habitants
thereof are country∣men;
they speak the same
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
language; they make war
and peace together—a king
is the ruler thereof.</P>
<P>Many kingdoms, and coun∣tries
full of people, and
islands, and large continents,
and different climates, make
up this whole world—God
governeth it. The people
swarm upon the face of it
like ants upon a hillock:
some are black with the hot
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
sun; some cover themselves
with furs against the sharp
cold; some drink of the
fruit of the vine; some the
pleasant milk of the cocoa∣nut;
and others quench their
thirst with the running stream.</P>
<P>All are God's family; he
knoweth every one of them,
as a shepherd knoweth his
flock: they pray to him in
different languages, but he
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
understandeth them all; he
heareth them all; he taketh
care of all; none are so great,
that he cannot punish them;
none are so mean, that he
will not protect them.</P>
<P>Negro woman, who sittest
pining in captivity, and weep∣est
over thy sick child;
though no one seeth thee,
God seeth thee; though no
one pitieth thee, God pitieth
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
thee: raise thy voice, forlorn
and abandoned one; call up∣on
him from amidst thy
bonds, for assuredly he will
hear thee.</P>
<P>Monarch, that rulest over
an hundred states; whose
frown is terrible as death,
and whose armies cover the
land, boast not thyself as
though there were none above
thee:—God is above thee;
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
his powerful arm is always
over thee; and if thou doest
ill, assuredly he will punish
thee.</P>
<P>Nations of the earth, fear
the Lord; families of men,
call upon the name of your
God.</P>
<P>Is there any one whom
God hath not made? let him
not worship him: is there
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
any one whom he hath not
blessed? let him not praise
him.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN IX.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us walk
abroad; let us talk of
the works of God.</P>
<P>Take up a handful of the
sand; number the grains of
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
it; tell them one by one into
your lap.</P>
<P>Try if you can count the
blades of grass in the field,
or the leaves on the trees.</P>
<P>You cannot count them,
they are innumerable; much
more the things which God
has made.</P>
<P>The fir groweth on the
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
high mountain, and the grey
willow bends above the
stream.</P>
<P>The thistle is armed with
sharp prickles; the mallow
is soft and woolly.</P>
<P>The hop layeth hold with
her tendrils, and claspeth the
tall pole; the oak hath firm
root in the ground, and re∣sisteth
the winter storm.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
<P>The daisy enamelleth the
meadows, and groweth beneath
the foot of the pas∣senger:
the tulip asketh a
rich soil, and the careful
hand of the gardener.</P>
<P>The iris and the reed
spring up in the marsh; the
rich grass covereth the mea∣dows;
and the purple heath-flower
enliveneth the waste
ground.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
<P>The water-lilies grow be∣neath
the stream; their broad
leaves float on the surface of
the water: the wall-flower
takes root in the hard stone,
and spreads its fragrance
amongst broken ruins.</P>
<P>Every leaf is of a different
form; every plant hath a
separate inhabitant.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
<P>Look at the thorns that
are white with blossoms, and
the flowers that cover the
fields, and the plants that
are trodden in the green path.
The hand of man hath not
planted them; the sower
hath not scattered the seeds
from his hand, nor the gar∣dener
digged a place for them
with his spade.</P>
<P>Some grow on steep rocks,
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
where no man can climb; in
shaking bogs, and deep fo∣rests,
and desert islands: they
spring up every where, and
cover the bosom of the whole
earth.</P>
<P>Who causeth them to grow
every where, and bloweth
the seeds about in winds, and
mixeth them with the mould,
and watereth them with soft
rains, and cherisheth them
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
with dews? Who sanneth
them with the pure breath of
Heaven; and giveth them
colours, and smells, and
spreadeth out their thin
transparent leaves?</P>
<P>How doth the rose draw
its crimson from the dark
brown earth, or the lily its
shining white? How can
a small seed contain a plant?
How doth every plant know
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
its season to put forth? They
are marshalled in order: each
one knoweth his place, and
standeth up in his own rank.</P>
<P>The snow-drop, and the
primrose, make haste to lift
their heads above the ground.
When the spring cometh,
they say, here we are! The
carnation waiteth for the full
strength of the year; and the
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
hardy laurustinus cheereth
the winter months.</P>
<P>Every plant produceth its
like. An ear of corn will
not grow from an acorn; nor
will a grape stone produce
cherries; but every one
springeth from its proper
seed.</P>
<P>Who preserveth them alive
through the cold of winter,
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
when the snow is on the
ground, and the sharp frost
bites on the plain? Who
saveth a small seed, and a
little warmth in the bosom of
the earth, and causeth them
to spring up afresh, and sap
to rise through the hard
fibres?</P>
<P>The trees are withered,
naked, and bare; they are
like dry bones. Who breath∣eth
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
on them with the breath
of spring, and they are co∣vered
with verdure, and green
leaves sprout from the dead
wood?</P>
<P>Lo, these are a part of his
works; and a little portion
of his wonders.</P>
<P>There is little need that I
should tell you of God, for
every thing speaks of him.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
<P>Every field is like an open
book; every painted flower
hath a lesson written on its
leaves.</P>
<P>Every murmuring brook
hath a tongue; a voice is
in every whispering wind.</P>
<P>They all speak of him who
made them; they all tell
us, he is very good.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
<P>We cannot see God, for
he is invisible; but we can
see his works, and worship
his foot-steps in the green
sod.</P>
<P>They that know the most,
will praise God the best; but
which of us can number half
his works?</P>

<HEAD>HYMN X.</HEAD>
<P>CHILD of mortality,
whence comest thou?
why is thy countenance sad,
and why are thine eyes red
with weeping?</P>
<P>I have seen the rose in its
beauty; it spread its leaves
to the morning sun—I re∣turned,
it was dying upon its
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
stalk; the grace of the form
of it was gone; its loveliness
was vanished away; the leaves
thereof were scattered on the
ground, and no one gathered
them again.</P>
<P>A stately tree grew on the
plain; its branches were co∣vered
with verdure; its boughs
spread wide and made a
goodly shadow; the trunk
was like a strong pillar; the
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
roots were like crooked fangs.—I
returned, the verdure was
nipt by the east wind; the
branches were lopt away by
the ax; the worm had made
its way into the trunk, and
the heart thereof was decayed;
it mouldered away, and fell
to the ground.</P>
<P>I have seen the insects
sporting in the sun-shine, and
darting along the stream;
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
their wings glittered with gold
and purple; their bodies
shone like the green emerald:
they were more numerous
than I could count; their
motions were quicker than
my eye could glance—I re∣turned,
they were brushed
into the pool; they were pe∣rishing
with the evening
breeze; the swallow had de∣voured
them; the pike had
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
seized them: there were none
found of so great a multitude.</P>
<P>I have seen man in the
pride of his strength; his
cheeks glowed with beauty;
his limbs were full of activity;
he leaped; he walked; he
ran; he rejoiced in that he
was more excellent than those—I
returned, he lay stiff and
cold on the bare ground; his
feet could no longer move,
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
nor his hands stretch them∣selves
out; his life was de∣parted
from him; and the
breath out of his nostrils:—therefore do I weep, because
DEATH is in the world; the
spoiler is among the works
of God: all that is made,
must be destroyed; all that
is born, must die.</P>

<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
<HEAD>HYMN XI.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE seen the flower
withering on the stalk,
and its bright leaves spread
on the ground—I looked
again, and it sprung forth
afresh; the stem was crowned
with new buds, and the sweet∣ness
therefore filled the air.</P>
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
<P>I have seen the sun set in
the west, and the shades of
night shut in the wide hori∣zon:
there was no colour,
nor shape, nor beauty, nor
music; gloom and darkness
brooded around—I looked,
the sun broke forth again
from the east, and gilded
the mountain tops; the lark
rose to meet him from her
low nest, and the shades of
darkness fled away.</P>
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
<P>I have seen the insect, being
come to its full size,
languish, and refuse to eat:
it spun itself a tomb, and
was shrouded in the silken
cone; it lay without feet,
or shape, or power to move—I
looked again, it had burst
its tomb; it was full of life,
and sailed on coloured wings
through the soft air; it rejoiced
in its new being.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
<P>Thus shall it be with thee,
O man! and so shall thy life
be renewed.</P>
<P>Beauty shall spring up out
of ashes, and life out of the
dust.</P>
<P>A little while shalt thou
lie in the ground, as the
seed lieth in the bosom of the
earth: but thou shalt be
raised again; and, if thou
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
art good, thou shalt never die
any more.</P>
<P>Who is he that cometh to
burst open the prison doors
of the tomb; to bid the dead
awake, and to gather his redeemed
from the four winds
of heaven?</P>
<P>He descendeth on a fiery
cloud; the sound of a trumpet
goeth before him; thou∣sands
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
of angels are on his
right hand.</P>
<P>It is Jesus, the Son of God;
the saviour of men; the
friend of the good.</P>
<P>He cometh in the glory
of his Father; he hath received
power from on high.</P>
<P>Mourn not therefore, child
of immortality!—for the spoil∣er,
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
the cruel spoiler that laid
waste the works of God, is
subdued: Jesus hath conquered
death:—child of immortality!
mourn no longer.</P>

<P>THE rose is sweet, but
it is surrounded with
thorns: the lily of the valley
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
is fragrant, but it springeth
up amongst the brambles.</P>
<P>The spring is pleasant, but
it is soon past: the summer
is bright, but the winter de∣stroyeth
the beauty thereof.</P>
<P>The rainbow is very glo∣rious,
but it soon vanisheth
away: life is good, but it is
quickly swallowed up in
death.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
<P>There is a land, where the
roses are without thorns,
where the flowers are not
mixed with brambles.</P>
<P>In that land, there is eter∣nal
spring, and light without
any cloud.</P>
<P>The tree of life groweth
in the midst thereof; rivers
of pleasures are there, and
flowers that never fade.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<P>Myriads of happy spirits
are there, and surround the
throne of God with a perpe∣tual
hymn.</P>
<P>The angels with their
golden harps sing praises con∣tinually,
and the cherubim
fly on wings of fire!</P>
<P>This country is Heaven:
it is the country of those that
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
are good; and nothing that
is wicked must inhabit there.</P>
<P>The toad must not spit its
venom amongst turtle doves;
nor the poisonous hen-bane
grow amongst sweet flowers.</P>
<P>Neither must any one that
doeth ill, enter into that
good land.</P>
<P>This earth is pleasant, for
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
it is God's earth, and it is
filled with many delightful
things.</P>
<P>But that country is far bet∣ter:
there we shall not grieve
any more, nor be sick any
more, nor do wrong any
more; there the cold of
winter shall not wither us, nor
the heats of summer scorch
us.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
<P>In that country there are
no wars nor quarrels, but all
love one another with dear
love.</P>
<P>When our parents and
friends die, and are laid in
the cold ground, we see them
here no more; but there we
shall embrace them again,
and live with them, and be
separated no more.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
<P>There we shall meet all
good men, whom we read of
in holy books.</P>
<P>There we shall see Abra∣ham,
the called of God, the
father of the faithful; and
Moses, after his long wander∣ings
in the Arabian desart;
and Elijah, the prophet of
God; and Daniel, who
escaped the lion's den; and
there the son of Jesse, the
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
shepherd king, the sweet
singer of Israel.</P>
<P>They loved God on earth;
they praised him on earth;
but in that country they will
praise him better, and love
him more.</P>
<P>There we shall see Jesus,
who is gone before us to
that happy place; and there
we shall behold the glory of
the high God.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
<P>We cannot see him here,
but we will love him here:
we must be now on earth,
but we will often think on
heaven.</P>
<P>That happy land is our
home: we are to be here but
for a little while, and there
for ever, even for ages of
eternal years.</P>
