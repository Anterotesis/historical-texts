<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO Sir <HI>JOHN BLOUNT,</HI> Bar.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ONDER not BLOUNT, whose magick Hand</L>
<L>Lifts to the Clouds thy native Land,</L>
<L>That in these busy, golden Times,</L>
<L>Thy Ears are teaz'd with trifling Rhimes;</L>
<L>For it's a common Practice grown</L>
<L>Amongst us Scriblers of the Town,</L>
<L>When Fortune says, poor Rogues! go whistle,</L>
<L>To some <HI>great Man</HI> to send Epistle;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>One, that has Will as well as Power,</L>
<L>To raise Us in a lucky Hour:</L>
<L>Thus <HI>P—or,</HI> sorrowful and lean,</L>
<L>A Statesman grew, and <HI>S—t</HI> a Dean.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHENEVER therefore, Madam Fame</L>
<L>Is pleas'd to raise some mighty Name,</L>
<L>For Service to his Country paid,</L>
<L>In Battle, Counsel, Law or Trade,</L>
<L>One of our meagre Order spies him,</L>
<L>And for his Patron closely plies him;</L>
<L>His next New Play to him addresses,</L>
<L>Hangs on him, flatters and caresses,</L>
<L>In Panegyricks, Dedications,</L>
<L>And slips no popular Occasions:</L>
<L>If he goes Five Miles out of Town,</L>
<L>The Muse must wait upon him down,</L>
<L>And in a Fustian, high-flown Ode,</L>
<L>Conduct him safe upon the Road;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>Nay, if the Minion but makes Water,</L>
<L>The World's acquainted with the Matter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, like a Leech, He keeps his Hold,</L>
<L>'Till loosen'd with a Purse of Gold,</L>
<L>Or silenc'd with a little Place;</L>
<L>The only Cures in such a Case!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>BUT who'd be publick at this Rate?</HI></L>
<L>Why Faith, Sir, 'tis a wretched State.</L>
<L>Full of Vexation, full of Noise,</L>
<L>And conscious of no humane Joys;</L>
<L>A turbulent, unquiet Scene,</L>
<L>With scarce a peaceful Hour between;</L>
<L>Angels by turns, and <HI>Daemons</HI> stil'd,</L>
<L>For ever flatter'd, or revil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Thee, O BLOUNT, in Fame grown old,</L>
<L>This Truth is needless to be told.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>O say, for mighty Schemes renown'd,</L>
<L>With full Success and Honour crown'd;</L>
<L>What anxious Cares disturb thy Breast,</L>
<L>Neglectful of thy Food and Rest?</L>
<L>How are thy weary Hours employ'd,</L>
<L>Of Sleep, of Ease, and Pleasure void?</L>
<L>How does each painful Evening close,</L>
<L>With begging Friends and railing Foes?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT Miracles enlarge my Thought,</L>
<L>By you upon your Country wrought?</L>
<L>Forgetting all her Woes and Fears,</L>
<L>BRITAIN no more with Envy hears</L>
<L>Of those proud, fabled Streams of old,</L>
<L>That flow'd o're shining Sands of Gold;</L>
<L>Thy Mines, PERU, surprize no more—</L>
<L>For see! On ALBION'S happy Shore,</L>
<L>Far greater Funds of Wealth abound,</L>
<L>Than in thy sultry Grotts are found;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Thro' every Realm her Credit reigns,</L>
<L>And <HI>Europe</HI> of its Riches drains.</L>
<L>The Nation, that distress'd of late,</L>
<L>With publick Debts, bewail'd her Fate,</L>
<L>Renew'd in all her ancient Strength,</L>
<L>Poizes once more the Lance's Length,</L>
<L>And marches, terrible in War,</L>
<L>To quel the rude, Blood-thirsty CZAR,</L>
<L>And crush the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI></NOTE> <HI>German Bigot</HI>'s Pride,</L>
<L>With Fleets and Hosts by THEE supply'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO MOSES smote the barren Rock,</L>
<L>(An Emblem of the SOUTH-SEA Stock!)</L>
<L>Which touch'd with his caelestial Rod,</L>
<L>Pour'd a full Stream, the Work of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, for the Labours of this Year,</L>
<L>Thy Toils, Fatigues, and publick Care,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>May'st Thou an Age unharrass'd live,</L>
<L>New Honours from thy Prince receive,</L>
<L>And grateful find a sinking Land</L>
<L>Preserv'd by thy all-skilful Hand!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT still my Business I forget;</L>
<L>Why, Sir, who pay a Nation's Debt,</L>
<L>By all the Wonders Thou hast wrought,</L>
<L><HI>Pilgarlick</HI> has not got a Groat?</L>
<L>Oft am I ask'd, NICK, prithee now,</L>
<L>In <HI>South-Sea Stock</HI> how much hast Thou?</L>
<L>To which I shake my Ears, and cry,</L>
<L>D—n it! I've none; the more Fool I!</L>
<L>For, Sir, 'twould vex a Cat, you know,</L>
<L>While Riches all around one flow,</L>
<L>('Twas poor, old TANTALUS'S Case)</L>
<L>To keep a starving, hungry Face;</L>
<L>In his new Berlin to behold,</L>
<L>All flaming with Brocade and Gold,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>A Coxcomb loll, who, but last Year,</L>
<L>A Livery was content to wear,</L>
<L>Now sumptuously at <HI>Caviack</HI>'s dine,</L>
<L>And drink the very best of Wine;</L>
<L><HI>Burgundy, Hermitage, Champaign,</HI></L>
<L>Liquors, that fire the dullest Brain!</L>
<L>While I perhaps, ill-fated Sinner!</L>
<L>Want Half a Crown to buy a Dinner,</L>
<L>Or at a cheap Cook's-Shop regale</L>
<L>On a <HI>Sheep's-Heart,</HI> and Pot of Ale.</L>
<L>But, Sir, all this is not the worst,</L>
<L>Still am I more compleatly curst,</L>
<L>My old Companions all grown rich,</L>
<L>Grow proud, and bid me kiss their Breech;</L>
<L>When at the Coffee-House we meet,</L>
<L>Or in the <HI>Alley,</HI> or the Street,</L>
<L>On me they never cast an Eye,</L>
<L>But take their Snuff and shoulder by.</L>
<L>Nay LAURA (which afflicts me most)</L>
<L>So many Years my constant Toast,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>So warmly and so truly lov'd,</L>
<L>False to our mutual Vows has prov'd;</L>
<L>Her Fortune chang'd, she changes too,</L>
<L>(Rich Maids alass! are seldom true!)</L>
<L>Spurns at my low, <HI>plebeian</HI> Fires,</L>
<L>And to an Equipage aspires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT humbly therefore I request,</L>
<L>(Oh! lay it kindly to your Breast)</L>
<L>Is, that when next all People flock,</L>
<L>To get <HI>Subscriptions</HI> to your <HI>Stock,</HI></L>
<L>You wou'd be pleas'd, 'tis what I crave,</L>
<L>Not to forget your humble Slave;</L>
<L>For tho' with all my Pains and Parts,</L>
<L>I cannot smoak these <HI>jobbing</HI> Arts,</L>
<L>Yet, like a certain Popish Tribe,</L>
<L>Implicitly I would SUBSCRIBE:</L>
<L><HI>Five Hundred,</HI> or a <HI>Thousand</HI> Pound</L>
<L>In your next List, would make me sound,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Drown all my Sorrows, if I nick it,</L>
<L>And make me merry as a Cricket.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT to your Care, what Claim have I,</L>
<L>On whom you never cast your Eye?</L>
<L>What Worth my self, or worthy Friend,</L>
<L>That can my Person recommend?</L>
<L>Faith not at all—but I am told,</L>
<L>That want of Friends, and want of Gold,</L>
<L>(A Mind so godlike you inherit)</L>
<L>Compensates for the want of Merit:</L>
<L>Just and Unjust, on Friend and Foe,</L>
<L>Like Heav'n, your Favours you bestow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU see, Sir, that I neither flatter,</L>
<L>Nor, like most Poets, mince the Matter,</L>
<L>Who never tell you what they want,</L>
<L>Nor what it is they'd have you grant,</L>
<L>Yet leave an Innuendo still,</L>
<L>That they shall take it bloody ill,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>If you don't straitway find out what</L>
<L>The meally Rascals would be at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT how much better would it be,</L>
<L>For every Poet, just like me,</L>
<L>To tell his Meaning at a Word,</L>
<L><HI>I want just Fifty Pounds, my Lord;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which Sum, if you refuse to give,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I shall eternally believe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For all, what I have said before,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That you're a sneaking Son of a Wh—re.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS would be honest, downright Dealing,</L>
<L>And might deserve a Fellow-feeling;</L>
<L>But when a Blockhead of a Bard</L>
<L>Declares, <HI>He looks for no Reward,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And that his Lordship's shining Worth</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was the sole Motive on God's Earth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That made him say, what he has said</HI>—</L>
<L>When all this while it was for Bread;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>Were I his Lordship, for the Jest, Sir,</L>
<L>I would not give the Dog a Tester.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For after all, your Dedicators,</L>
<L>Howe're they may disguise their Matters,</L>
<L>Will prove, when they have stood the Test,</L>
<L>But <HI>genteel Mumpers</HI> at the best;</L>
<L>For where's the Difference, prithee say,</L>
<L>If both ask Money, in their Way,</L>
<L>Whether they beg in Prose or Rhime,</L>
<L>In vulgar Gibberish, or sublime?</L>
<L><HI>Your Charity,</HI> the Beggar cries,</L>
<L>And shakes his Head, and rolls his Eyes;</L>
<L>BAYS gives indeed a finer Touch,</L>
<L>But still his Words imply as much.</L>
<L>The Beggar coaxes every Donor,</L>
<L>With <HI>Noble Master, dear your Honour!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Poetick Almsmen</HI> do the same,</L>
<L>They tell you of your ancient Fame,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>How long your Family has stood,</L>
<L>An Age, perhaps, before the Flood.</L>
<L>The Beggar, give him but a Penny,</L>
<L>Will wish you Forty Times as many,</L>
<L>Then leave you with a kind Oration—</L>
<L>Just so does every Dedication:</L>
<L><HI>That you may long enjoy your Health,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Long live in Pleasure, and in Wealth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And late be snatch'd into the Grave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is what I still sincerely crave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Your most devoted, humble Slave.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT what from hence do I infer?</L>
<L>Why only this, illustrious Sir,</L>
<L>That no Man should deny the Trade,</L>
<L>By which his Fortune's to be made;</L>
<L>That Authors, therefore, in their <HI>Letters</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dedicatory</HI> to their Betters,</L>
<L>Should in plain <HI>English</HI> let them know</L>
<L>How with their Bellies Matters go,</L>
<L><PB REF="14"/>And not set Gentlemen the Task</L>
<L>To give them what they never ask.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT you, Sir, can't make this Excuse;</L>
<L>And therefore sleep in Peace, my Muse,</L>
<L>Secure that e'er a few Months end,</L>
<L>Relying on so good a Friend,</L>
<L>We both shall leave this servile Garret,</L>
<L>Good Wild-fowl eat, and drink good Claret;</L>
<L>And, since to Him we owe our Wealth,</L>
<L>Never forget Sir JOHN'S good Health.</L>
</LG>
<P>From my Lodgings up Three Pair of Stairs, at Mr. <HI>Francklin</HI>'s, in <HI>Fleet∣street; July 15. 1720.</HI></P>
