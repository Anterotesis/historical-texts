<L>D'ARCY, to thee, whate'er of happier vein,</L>
<L>Smit with the love of Song my youth essay'd,</L>
<L>This verse devotes from ASTON's secret shade,</L>
<L>Where letter'd Ease, thy gift, endears the scene.</L>
<L>Here, as the light-wing'd moments glide serene,</L>
<L>I weave the bower, around the tufted mead</L>
<L>In careless flow the simple pathway lead,</L>
<L>And strew with many a rose the shaven green.</L>
<L>So, to deceive my solitary days,</L>
<L>With rural toils ingenuous arts I blend,</L>
<L>Secure from envy, negligent of praise,</L>
<L>Yet not unknown to fame, if D'ARCY lend</L>
<L>His wonted smile to dignify my lays,</L>
<L>The Muses Patron, but the Poet's Friend.</L>

<L>Or on the banks of Thames, or met their train,</L>
<L>Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray?</L>

<L>But now it boots ye not in these to stray,</L>
<L>Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse,</L>

<L>For oft the mighty Master rous'd his waves</L>
<L>With martial notes, or lull'd with strain of love:</L>
<L>He must not now in brisk maeanders flow</L>
<L>Gamesome, and kiss the sadly-silent shore,</L>

<L>Say first, Sicilian Muse,</L>

<L>How, in yon grot, each silver trickling spring</L>
<L>Wander'd the shelly channels all among;</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDGAR,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> having heard the beauty of <HI>ELFRIDA,</HI> daughter of <HI>ORGAR,</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon∣shire,</HI> highly celebrated; sent his Favourite Minister <HI>ATHELWOLD</HI> to the father's castle, to discover whether she was really so beautiful, as Fame reported her to be; and if she was, to offer her his Crown in marriage. <HI>ATHELWOLD,</HI> on seeing her, fell violently in Love with her himself; and married her; conveying her soon after to his own castle in <HI>Harewood Forest,</HI> where he visited her by stealth from court; and in his absence left her with a train of <HI>British</HI> Virgins, who form the <HI>CHORUS</HI>. After three months, <HI>ORGAR,</HI> disapproving this confinement of his daughter, came disguised to <HI>Harewood</HI> to discover the cause of it. His arrival opens the Drama. The inci∣dents, which are produced by <HI>ATHELWOLD</HI>'s return from court (who was absent when <HI>ORGAR</HI> came to his castle) and afterwards by the unexpected visit of the King, form the <HI>EPISODE</HI> of the Tragedy; the feigned pardon of <HI>ATHELWOLD,</HI> drawn from the King by the earnest inter∣cessions of <HI>ELFRIDA,</HI> brings on the <HI>PERIPETIA,</HI> or change of fortune; and the single combat between the King and <HI>ATHELWOLD,</HI> in which the latter is slain, occasions <HI>ELFRIDA</HI> to take the vow, which completes the <HI>CATASTROPHE</HI>.</P>

<L>HOW nobly does this venerable wood,</L>
<L>Gilt with the glories of the orient sun,</L>
<L>Embosom yon fair mansion! The soft air</L>
<L>Salutes me with most cool and temp'rate breath;</L>
<L>And, as I tread, the flow'r-besprinkled lawn</L>
<L>Sends up a gale of fragrance. I should guess,</L>
<L>If e'er Content deign'd visit mortal clime,</L>
<L>This was her place of dearest residence.</L>
<L>Grant Heav'n! I find it such. 'Tis now three months,</L>
<L>Since first Earl ATHELWOLD espous'd my daughter.</L>
<L>He then besought me, for some little space</L>
<L>The nuptials might be secret; many reasons,</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="78"/>He said, induc'd to this: I made no pause,</L>
<L>But, resting on his prudence, to his will</L>
<L>Gave absolute concurrence. Soon as married,</L>
<L>He to this secret seat convey'd ELFRIDA;</L>
<L>Convey'd her as by stealth, enjoy'd, and left her:</L>
<L>Yet not without I know not what excuse</L>
<L>Of call to court, of EDGAR's royal friendship,</L>
<L>And England's welfare. To his prince he went:</L>
<L>And since, as by intelligence I gather,</L>
<L>He oft returns to this his cloyster'd wife;</L>
<L>But ever with a privacy most studied;</L>
<L>Borrowing disguises till inventive art</L>
<L>Can scarce supply him with variety.</L>
<L>His visits, as they're stol'n, are also short;</L>
<L>Seldom beyond the circuit of one sun;</L>
<L>Then back to court, while she his absence mourns</L>
<L>Full many a lonely hour. I brook not this.</L>
<L>Had ATHELWOLD espous'd some base-born peasant,</L>
<L>This usage had been apt: but when he took</L>
<L>My daughter to his arms, he took a virgin,</L>
<L>Thro' whose rich veins the blood of British Kings</L>
<L>Ran in unsullied stream. Her lineage sure</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="79"/>Might give her place and notice with the noblest</L>
<L>In EDGAR's court. ELFRIDA's beauty too</L>
<L>(I speak not from a father's foolish fondness)</L>
<L>Would shine amid the fairest, and reflect</L>
<L>No vulgar glory on that beauty's master.</L>
<L>This act bespeaks the madman. Who, that own'd</L>
<L>An em'rald, jasper, or rich chrysolite,</L>
<L>Would hide its lustre, or not bid it blaze</L>
<L>Conspicuous on his brow? Haply ATHELWOLD</L>
<L>May have espous'd some other. 'Sdeath he durst not.</L>
<L>My former feats in arms must have inform'd him,</L>
<L>That ORGAR, while he liv'd, would never prove</L>
<L>A traitor to his honour. If he has—</L>
<L>This aged arm is not so much unstrung</L>
<L>By slack'ning years, but just revenge will brace it.</L>
<L>And, by yon awful heav'n—But hold, my rage.</L>
<L>I came to search into this matter coolly.</L>
<L>Hence, to conceal the father and the earl,</L>
<L>This pilgrim's staff, and scrip, and all these marks</L>
<L>Of vagrant poverty.</L>

<L>Know, Virgins, I was born</L>

<L>Atchiev'd full many a feat of martial prowess:</L>
<L>Nor was my skill in chivalry unnoted</L>

<L>Fills (as loud fame reports) right royally;</L>
<L>I then, unfit for pageantry and courts,</L>
<L>Sat down in peace among my faithful vassals,</L>
<L>At my paternal seat. But ah! not long</L>
<L>Had I enjoy'd the sweets of that recess,</L>
<L>Ere by the savage inroads of base hinds,</L>
<L>That sallied frequent from the Scotish heights,</L>
<L>My lands were all laid waste, my people murder'd;</L>
<L>And I, thro' impotence of age unfit</L>

<L>We pity and condole thy wretched state,</L>

<L>Alas, no tyrant he; the more our wonder</L>

<LG>
<L>Whence can it rise, but from the sober pow'r</L>

<L>If thy arm prosper, this my dying tongue</L>

<L>He aim'd his falchion at the Monarch's head,</L>
<L>Only to leave his own brave breast defenceless.</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CARACTACUS,</HI> King of the <HI>Silures,</HI> having been defeated by <HI>OSTORIUS,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Praefect, his Queen taken prisoner, and his Son (as it is supposed) either slain or fled, retired with his only Daughter, and took sanctuary amongst the <HI>DRUIDS</HI> in <HI>Mona. OSTORIUS,</HI> after the battle, leaving garrisons in the conquered country, marched to subdue the northern part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and led his troops to the frontiers of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> then governed by <HI>CARTISMANDUA</HI>. This Queen, dreading the victorious enemy, made a truce with him; one of the conditions of which was, that she should assist the <HI>Romans</HI> in securing the <HI>British</HI> King, that he might be carried to <HI>Rome</HI> to grace the triumph of <HI>CLAUDIUS</HI>. She accordingly gave up her two Sons as Hostages, to be sent themselves to <HI>Rome,</HI> in case they did not seduce <HI>CARACTACUS</HI> from his Sanc∣tuary, to which place they were to be accompanied by <HI>AULUS DIDIUS,</HI> and a sufficient force, to effect that design.</P>
<P>The Drama opens on their arrival in the consecrated grove, a little before midnight, and about the time when the <HI>DRUIDS,</HI> who form the <HI>CHORUS,</HI> were preparing the ceremonial of <HI>CARACTACUS</HI>'s admission into their order. The two Princes are seized as spies, and the incidents, consequent upon this, form what is called the <HI>EPISODE</HI> of the piece. The <HI>EXODE,</HI> or <HI>CATASTROPHE,</HI> is prepared by the coming of <HI>ARVIRAGUS</HI> the King's son, who, having escaped with life in the late battle, had employed the inter∣mediate time in privately collecting his Father's scattered forces, to put him again in a condition of facing the enemy. His bravery, in defending his Father and the <HI>DRUIDS,</HI> occasions the <HI>PERIPETIA,</HI> or change of fortune; and his death, with the final captivity of <HI>CARACTACUS,</HI> con∣cludes the Tragedy.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE.</HEAD>
<P>* ELFRIDA, to which these letters were prefixt in the former Editions of that Poem.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q></NOTE> Poem, that it would be liable to the very objections you make to it. Yet perhaps they will be obviated to your satisfaction, when I have laid before you (as indeed I ought to have done at first) the original idea which led me to chuse such a subject, and to execute it in so peculiar a manner.</P>
<P>Had I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntended to give an exact copy of the an∣tient Drama, your objections to the present Poem would be unanswerable. But my design was much less confined. I meant only to pursue the antient me∣thod, so far as it is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt himself to the genius of our times, and the character of our Trage∣dy. According to this notion, every thing was to be al∣lowed to the present taste, which nature and Aristotle could possibly dispense with; and nothing of intrigue or refinement was to be admitted, at which antient judgment could reasonably take offence. Good sense, as well as antiquity, prescribed an adherence to the three great Unities; these therefore were strictly ob∣served. But on the other hand, to follow the mo∣dern masters in those respects wherein they had not so faultily deviated from their predecessors, a story was
<PB N="294" REF="290"/>
chosen, in which the tender rather than the noble passions were predominant, and in which even love had the principal share. Characters too were drawn as nearly approaching to private ones, as Tragic dig∣nity would permit; and affections raised rather from the impulse of common humanity, than the distresses of royalty and the fate of kingdoms. Beside this, for the sake of natural embellishment, and to reconcile mere modern readers to that simplicity of fable, in which I thought it necessary to copy the Antients, I contrived to lay the scene in an old romantic forest. For, by this means, I was enabled to enliven the Poem by various touches of pastoral description; not affectedly brought in from the store-house of a pictu∣resque imagination, but necessarily resulting from the scenery of the place itself: A beauty so extremly strik∣ing in the COMUS of Milton, and the AS YOU LIKE IT of Shakespeare; and of which the Greek Muse (though fond of rural Imagery) has afforded few ex∣amples, besides that admirable one in the PHILOCTE∣TES of Sophocles.</P>
<P>By this idea I could wish you to regulate your cri∣ticism. I need not, I think, observe to you that these deviations from the practice of the Antients may be reasonably defended. For we were long since agreed, that where Love does not degenerate into episodical gallantry, but makes the foundation of the distress, it is, from the universality of its influence, a passion very proper for Tragedy. And I have seen you too much moved at the representation of some of our best Tragedies of private story, to believe you will con∣demn me for making the other deviation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="295" REF="291"/>
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM glad, you approve the method, I have taken, of softening the rigor of the old Drama. If I have, indeed, softened it sufficiently for the modern taste, without parting with any of the essentials of the Greek method, I have obtained my purpose: which was to obviate some of the popular objections made to the antient form of Tragedy. For the cur∣rent Opinion, you know, is, that by the strict adhe∣rence to the Unities, it restrains the genius of the Poet; by the simplicity of its conduct, it diminishes the pathos of the fable; and, by the admission of a continued chorus, prevents that agreable embarrass, which awakens our attention, and interests our pas∣sions.</P>
<P>The universal veneration, which we pay to the name of Shakespeare, at the same time that it has improved our relish for the higher beauties of Poetry, has un∣doubtedly been the ground-work of all this false criti∣cism. That disregard, which, in compliance merely with the taste of the times, he shewed of all the ne∣cessary rules of the Drama, hath since been considered as a characteristic of his vast and original genius; and con∣sequently set up as a model for succeding writers. Hence M. Voltaire remarks very justly,
<Q>“que le merite de cet auteur a perdu le Theatre Anglois. Le tems, qui seul fait la reputation des hommes, rend à la ”fin leurs defauts respectables.</Q></P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding the absurdity of this low su∣perstition, the notion is so popular amongst English∣men,
<PB N="296" REF="292"/>
that I fear it will never be entirely discredited, till a poet rises up amongst us with a genius as eleva∣ted and daring as Shakespeare's, and a judgment as sober and chastised as Racine's. But as it seems too long to wait for this prodigy, it will not surely be improper for any one of common talents, who would entertain the public without indulging its caprice, to take the best models of antiquity for his guides; and to adapt those models, as near as may be, to the man∣ners and taste of his own times. Unless he do both, he will, in effect, do nothing. For it cannot be doubted, that the many gross faults of our stage are owing to the complaisance and servility, with which the ordinary run of writers have ever humoured that illiterate, whimsical, or corrupted age, in which it was their misfortune to be born.</P>
<P>Milton, you will tell me, is a noble exception to this observation. He is so, and would have been a nobler, had he not run into the contrary extreme. The contempt in which, perhaps with justice, he held the age he lived in, prevented him from condescend∣ing either to amuse or instruct it. He had, before, given to his unworthy Countrymen the noblest Poem that genius, conducted by antient art, could produce; and he had seen them receive it with disregard, if not with dislike. Conscious therefore of his own dignity, and of their demerit, he looked to posterity, only for his reward, and to posterity only directed his future labours. Hence it was perhaps, that he formed his SAMPSON AGONISTES on a model more simple and severe than Athens herself would have demanded; and took Aeschylus for his master rather than So∣phocles
<PB N="297" REF="293"/>
or Euripides: intending by this conduct to put as great a distance as possible between himself and his contemporary writers; and to make his work (as he himself said) <HI>much different from what amongst them passed for the best</HI>. The success of the Poem was, ac∣cordingly, what one would have expected. The age, it appeared in, treated it with total neglect; neither hath that posterity, to which he appealed, and which has done justice to most of his other writings, as yet given to this excellent piece its full measure of po∣pular and universal fame. Perhaps, in your closet, and that of a few more, who unaffectedly admire genuine nature and antient simplicity, the Agonistes may hold a distinguished rank. Yet, surely, we can∣not say (in Hamlet's phrase) "<HI>that it pleases the Mil∣lion; it is still Caviar to the general</HI>."</P>
<P>Hence, I think, I may conclude, that unless one would be content with a very late and very learned posterity, Milton's conduct in this point should not be followed. A Writer of tragedy must certainly adapt himself more to the general taste; because the Dra∣matic, of all kinds of Poetry, ought to be most uni∣versally relished and understood. The Lyric Muse addresses herself to the imagination of a reader; the Didactic to his judgment; but the Tragic strikes di∣rectly on his passions. Few men have a strength of imagination capable of pursuing the flights of Pin∣dar; many have not a clearness of apprehension suited to the reasonings of Lucretius and Pope: But every man has passions to be excited; and every man feels them excited by Shakespeare.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294"/>But, though Tragedy be thus chiefly directed to the heart, it must be observed, that it will seldom attain its end without the concurrent approbation of the judgment. And to procure this, the artificial con∣struction of the fable goes a great way. In France, the excellence of their several poets is chiefly measured by this standard. And amongst our own writers, if you except Shakespeare (who indeed ought, for his other virtues, to be exempt from common rules) you will find, that the most regular of their compositions is generally reckoned their <HI>Chef d'oeuvre</HI>, witness the <HI>All for Love</HI> of Dryden, the <HI>Venice preserved</HI> of Ot∣way, and the <HI>Jane Shore</HI> of Rowe.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE scheme, you proposed in your last, is I own practicable enough. Undoubtedly, most part of the Dialogue of the Chorus might be put into the mouth of an Emma or Matilda, who, with some little shew of sisterly concernment, might be ea∣sily made to claim kindred with Earl Athelwold. Nay, by the addition of a few unnecessary inci∣dents, which would cost me no more than they are worth in contriving, and an unmeaning personage or two, who would be as little expence in creating, I believe I could quickly make the whole tolera∣bly fit for an English Audience.</P>
<P>But for all this I cannot persuade myself to en∣ter upon the task. I have, I know not how (like many of my betters) contracted a kind of
<PB N="299" REF="295"/>
veneration for the old Chorus; and am willing to think it essential to the Tragic Drama. You shall hear the reasons that incline me to this judgment. They respect the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Audience</HI>.</P>
<P>It is agreed, I think, on all hands, that in the conduct of a fable, the admission of a Chorus lays a necessary restraint on the <HI>Poet</HI>. The two Unities of time and place, are esteemed by some of less consequence in our modern Tragedy, than the third Unity of Action; but admit a Chorus, and you must, of necessity, restore them to those equal rights, which they antiently enjoyed, and yet claim, by the Charter of Aristotle. For the difference, which the use of the Chorus makes, is this: The modern Drama contents itself with a fact <HI>represented</HI>; the antient requires it to be <HI>represented before Spectators</HI>. Now as it cannot be supposed, that these Spectators should accompany the chief personages into private apartments, one single Scene, or <HI>unity of Place</HI>, becomes strictly necessary. And as these Spectators are assembled on purpose to observe and bear a part in the action, the <HI>time</HI> of that action becomes, of course, that of the spectacle or representation itself; it being unreasonable to make the Spectators attend so long, as the Poet, in bring∣ing about his Catastrophe, may require. And this is usually the practice of the antient Stage. The mo∣dern, on the contrary, regards very little these two capital restraints; and its difuse of the Chorus helps greatly to conceal the absurdity. For the Poet, with∣out offending so much against the laws of probabi∣lity, may lead his personages from one part to ano∣ther of the same palace or city, when they have only
<PB N="300" REF="296"/>
a paultry Servant or insignificant Confidant to attend them. He may think himself at liberty to spend two or three days, months, or even years, in com∣pleating his story; to clear the stage at the end, or, if he pleases, in the middle of every act: and, be∣ing under no controul of the Chorus, he can break the continuity of the Drama, just where he thinks it convenient; and, by the assistance of a brisk fugue and a good violin, can persuade his audience, that as much time has elapsed as his Hero's, or rather his own distress, may demand.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that secret intrigues become (as Mr. Dryden gravely calls them) the <HI>beauties of our modern Stage</HI>. Hence it is, that Incidents, and Bustle, and <HI>Business</HI>, supply the place of Simplicity, Nature, and Pathos: A happy change, perhaps, for the ge∣nerality of writers, who might otherwise find it im∣possible to fill <HI>cette longue carriere de cinq actes</HI>, which a Writer, sufficiently experienced in these matters, says, <HI>est si prodigieusement difficile à remplir sans E∣pisodes</HI>.</P>
<P>But, whatever these Play-makers may have gained by rejecting the Chorus, the true Poet has lost con∣siderably by it. For he has lost a graceful and natural resource to the embellishments of Pictu∣resque Description, sublime allegory, and whatever else comes under the denomination of <HI>pure Poetry</HI>. Shakespeare, indeed, had the power of introducing this naturally, and, what is most strange, of joining it with <HI>pure Passion</HI>. But I make no doubt, if we had a Tragedy of his formed on the Greek model, we should find in it more frequent, if not nobler in∣stances
<PB N="301" REF="297"/>
of his high Poetical capacity, than in any single composition he has left us. I think you have a proof of this in those parts of his historical plays, which are called Chorus's, and written in the com∣mon Dialogue metre. And your imagination will easily conceive, how fine an ode the description of the night preceding the battle of Agincourt, would have made in his hands; and what additional grace it would receive from that form of composition.</P>
<P>With the means of introducing Poetry naturally is lost, also, the opportunity of conveying moral reflections with grace and propriety. But this comes more properly under consideration, when I give you my thoughts on the advantage the audience received from a well-conducted Chorus.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN my last I took no notice of that superior pomp and majesty, which the Chorus necessarily added to the scene of the Drama. I made no remarks on the agreable variety it introduced into the versifi∣cation and metre; nor shewed how, by uniting the harmony of the Lyre to the pomp of the Buskin, music became intimately connected with it, and fur∣nished it with all its additional graces. These and many other advantages I might have insisted upon, had I thought them so material as the two I men∣tioned; the latter of which, namely, its being a pro∣per vehicle for moral and sentiment, is so material,
<PB N="302" REF="298"/>
that I think nothing can possibly atone for the loss of it.</P>
<P>In those parts of the Drama, where the judgment of a mixt audience is most liable to be misled by what passes before its view, the chief actors are ge∣nerally too much agitated by the furious passions, or too much attached by the tender ones, to think coolly, and impress on the spectators a moral senti∣ment properly. A Confidant or Servant has seldom sense enough to do it, never dignity enough to make it regarded. Instead therefore of these, the Antients were provided with a band of distinguished persons, not merely capable of seeing and hearing, but of arguing, advising, and reflecting; from the leader of which a moral sentiment never came unnaturally, but suitably and gracefully; and from the troop it∣self, a poetical flow of tender commiseration, of reli∣gious supplication, or of virtuous triumph, was ever ready to heighten the pathos, to inspire a reverential awe of the Deity, and to advance the cause of <HI>honesty</HI> and of truth.</P>
<P>If you ask me, how it augmented the pathetic, I cannot give you a better answer than the <HI>Abbé Vatry</HI> has done in his dissertation on the subject, published in the <HI>Memoirs de l'Acad. des Inser. &amp;c.</HI>
<Q>“It ef∣fected this (says he) both in its <HI>odes</HI> and <HI>dialogue</HI>. The wonderful power of Music and the Dance is universally allowed. And, as these were always <HI>accompaniments</HI> to the Odes, there is no doubt but they contributed greatly to move the passions. It was necessary that there should be odes or intermedes, but it was also necessary, that these
<PB N="303" REF="299"/>
intermedes should not suffer the minds of the Au∣dience to cool, but, on the contrary, should sup∣port and fortify those passions which the previous scenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this effect better, than the choral songs and dances, which filled the mind with ideas corresponding to the subject, and never failed to add new force to the sentiments of the principal personages. In the Dialogue also, the Chorus served to move the passions, by shewing to the spectators other spectators strongly affected by the action. A spectacle of such a kind as is fitted to excite in us the passions of <HI>Terror</HI>, and <HI>Pity</HI>, will not of itself so strongly affect us, as when we see others, also, affected by it. The paint∣ers have generally understood this secret, and have had recourse to an expedient, similar to that of the Chorus of the poets. Not content with the simple representation of an historical event, they have also added groups of assistant figures, and exprest in their faces the different passions, they would have their picture excite. Nay they sometimes inlist into their service even irrational animals. In the <HI>slaughter of the Innocents</HI>, le Brun was not satisfied with expressing all the hor∣ror, of which the subject is naturally capable, he has also painted two horses with their hair standing on end, and starting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding infants. This is an artifice which has often been employed, and which has always succeeded. A good poet should do the same; and Iphigenia should not be suf∣fered
<PB N="304" REF="300"/>
to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with persons capable of feeling her ”misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>Had this ingenious Abbé seen the famous Belli∣sarius of Vandyke, I am apt to believe he would have thought it a much more noble illustration of the matter. The Soldier in that piece, though so much condemned by our modern Professors of <HI>Vertû</HI> for being, as they say, the principal Figure, is the very thing which raises this picture from a simple Portrait (which it must otherwise have been) to the finest moral painting; and in Greece would have placed the painter amongst that class of Artists, which they esteemed the noblest, the ΗΘΟΓΡΑΦΟΙ. The greatest Tragic Poet could not have raised a more exquisite distress than this judicious painter has done by the attitude of that Soldier; as well as by the subordinate figures, which, with great propriety, are female ones; nothing being so likely to raise in a military mind that mixture of pity and disdain, which he wanted to express, as to see such a hero relieved by charity, and that too the charity of girls and old women.</P>
<P>But, returning to my subject, I will just observe to you, that if it be proper to assist an audience in relishing the pathetic, by shewing an imitation of that pathos in the Chorus, it is much more so to instruct them how to be affected properly, with the characters and actions which are represented in the course of the Drama. The character of PIERRE in <HI>Venice preserved</HI>, when left entirely to the judg∣ment of the audience, is perhaps one of the most
<PB N="305" REF="301"/>
improper for public view, that ever was produced on any stage. It is almost impossible, but some part of the spectators should go from the representation with very false and immoral impressions. But had the Tragedy been written on the antient plan; had Pierre's character been drawn just as it is, and some few alterations made in Jaffier's, I know no two characters more capable of doing service in a mo∣ral view, when justly animadverted upon by the Cho∣rus. I don't say, I would have trusted Otway with the writing of it.</P>
<P>To have done, and to release you. Bad characters become on this plan as harmless in the hands of the Poet, as the Historian; and good ones become infi∣nitely more useful, by how much the Poetic is more forcible than the Historical mode of instruction.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE reason, why in a former Letter you ad∣vised me to alter the Chorus, is made very apparent in your last. For, by persuading me to get the Odes set to music, and to risk the Play on the stage, I understand only that you are willing, any how, to make it a more profitable work for me, than it can possibly be by means of the press alone.</P>
<P>Yet certainly, Sir, one single reflection on our Bri∣tish pit will make you change your sentiments ef∣fectually. Think only on the trial made by M. Ra∣cine, in a nation much before ours, in a taste for pro∣bability and decorum in Theatrical diversions. In his
<PB N="306" REF="302"/>
two last Tragedies, you know, he has fully succeeded in the very thing I aimed at; and has adapted a noble imitation of antient simplicity to the taste of his own times: particularly in his <HI>Athalia</HI>, a poem in which the most superb and august spectacle, the most inte∣resting event, and the most sublime flow of inspired Poetry, are all nobly and naturally united. Yet I am told, that neither that, nor the <HI>Esther</HI>, retains its Chorus, when represented on the French Theatre.</P>
<P>To what is this owing? To the refinement most cer∣tainly of our modern music. This art is now carried to such a pitch of perfection, or if you will of corruption, which makes it utterly incapable of being an adjunct to Poetry. <HI>Il y a grand apparence, que les progrès que vous avez faits dans la musique, ont nui enfin à ceux de la veri∣table Tragedie. C'est un talent, qui a fait tort à un autre</HI>; says M. Voltaire with his usual taste and judgment. Our different cadences, our divisions, variations, re∣petitions, without which modern music cannot subsist, are entirely improper for the expression of poetry, and were scarce known to the Antients.</P>
<P>But could this be managed, the additional ex∣pence necessarily attendant on such a performance, would make the matter impracticable. This Mr. Dryden foresaw long ago. The passage is curious.</P>
<P><Q>“A new Theatre, much more ample and much deeper, must be made for that purpose; besides the cost of sometimes forty or fifty habits: which is an expence too large to be supplied by a compa∣ny of actors. It is true, I should not be sorry to see a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as ours; built and adorned at a
<PB N="307" REF="303"/>
King's charges; and on that condition, and another, which is, that my hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I should not despair of mak∣ing such <HI>a Tragedy</HI> as might be both <HI>instructive</HI> and ”<HI>delightful</HI> according to the <HI>manner</HI> of the Grecians.</Q>
What he means by having <HI>his hands bound</HI>, I imagine, is, that he was either engaged to his subscribers for a Translation of Virgil, or to the manager of the Thea∣tre for so many plays a season. This suffrage of Mr. Dryden is, however, very apposite to the present point. It serves, also, to vindicate my design of imitating the Greek Drama. For if he, who was so prejudiced to the modern stage, as to think intrigue a capital beauty in it; if he, I say, owns that the grand secret <HI>prodesse et delectare</HI> was the characteristic of the Greek Drama only, nothing can better justify my present attempt than the approbation he gives to it in this passage.</P>
<P>Having now settled with you all matters of general criticism, I hope in your next you will give me your objections to <HI>scenes, speeches, images</HI>, &amp;c. And be assured I shall treat your judgment in these matters with greater deference, than I have done in what re∣lated to the Stage and the Chorus.</P>

<P>The ovum anguinum, or serpent's egg; a famous Druidical amulet, thus circumstantially described by Pliny.—Praeterea est ovorum genus in magna Gal∣liarum fama, omissum Graecis. Angues innumeri aestate convoluti, salivis faucium corporumque spumis artifici complexu glomerantur; Anguinum appellatur. Druidae sibilis id dicunt in sublime jactari, sagoque oportere intercipi, ne tellurem attingat. Profugere raptorem equo, serpentes enim insequi, donec arceantur, amnis alicujus interventu, &amp;c. Nat. Hist. l. xxix. c. 3.</P>
<P>There are remains of this superstition still, both in the northern and western parts of our island. For Lhwyd, the author of the Archeologia, writes thus to Rowland; see Mona Antiqua, p. 338.
<Q>“The Druid doctrine about the <HI>Glain Neidr</HI>, obtains very much through all Scotland, as well lowlands as highlands; but there is not a word of it in this kingdom (Ireland);
<PB N="314" REF="308"/>
where, as there are no snakes, they could not pro∣pagate it. Besides snake-stones, the highlanders have their snail-stones, paddock-stones, &amp;c. to all which they attribute their several virtues, and wear ”them as amulets.</Q>
And in another letter he writes,
<Q>“The Cornish retain variety of charms, and have still, towards the land's end, the amulet of Maen Magal, and Glain Neidr, which latter they call a Milpreu, or Melpreu, and have a charm for the snake to make it, when they have found one asleep, and ”struck a hazel wand in the center of her spires.</Q></P>

<P>The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremonies, &amp;c which are unquestionably Druidi∣cal, makes it necessary in this, and in other places of the Drama, to have recourse to Tacitus's account of the Germans, amongst whom, if there were really no established Druids, there was certainly a great corre∣spondency, in religious opinions, with the Gauls and Britons. The passage here alluded to is taken from his 10th chapter. Proprium gentis, equorumque quo∣que praesagia ac monitus experiri. Publice aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis, candidi &amp; nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pressos sacro curru, sacerdos ac rex, vel princeps civitatis comitantur, hinnitus &amp; fre∣mitus observant, nec ulli auspicio major fides non so∣lum apud plebem, sed apud proceres, apud sacerdotes.</P>

<P>This is meant to describe the rocking-stone, of which there are several still to be seen in Wales, Corn∣wall, and Derbyshire. They are universally supposed, by antiquarians, to be Druid monuments; and Mr. Toland thinks,
<Q>“that the Druids made the people be∣lieve that they only could move them, and that by a miracle, by which they condemned or acquitted the accused, and often brought criminals to confess ”what could in no other way be extorted from them.</Q>
It was this conjecture which gave the hint for this piece of machinery. The reader may find a description of one of these rocking-stones in Camden's Britannia, in his account of Pembrokeshire; and also several in Bor∣lase's history of Cornwall.</P>

<P>This account is taken from what history tells us did really happen some years after, when the groves of Mona were destroyed by Suetonius Paulinus. Igitur Monam insulam incolis validam, &amp; receptaculum per∣fugarum aggredi parat, navesque fabricatur plano alveo, adversus breve litus &amp; incertum. Sic Pedes; equites vado secuti, aut altiores inter undas, adnantes equis transmisere.

Druidae circum, preces diras sublatis ad coelum manibus fundentes, novitate aspectus perculere milites ut quasi haerentibus membris, immobile corpus vul∣neribus praeberent.

<Q>These shapeless symbols of your barbarous gods.</Q>

<P>The Druids did not really worship the divinity under any symbol. But this is put intentionally into the mouth of the Roman, as mistaking the rude stones placed round the grove, for idols. Thus Lucan in his beautiful description of a Druid grove,
<Q><L>—simulacraque moesta deorum</L>
<L>Arte carent caesisque extant informia truncis.</L>
<BIBL>Phar. Lib. iii.</BIBL></Q>
Some imagery from the same description is also bor∣rowed in the opening of the Drama.</P>

<Q>—Soldier, I had arms.</Q>
