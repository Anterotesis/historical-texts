<HEAD>THE ELEPHANT<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot"><P>The Elephant has a long cartilaginous trunk, formed of multitudes of rings, pliant in all directions, and terminated with a small moveable hook. The nostrils are at the end of the trunk, which is used, like a hand, to convey any thing in∣to the mouth. This animal has no cutting teeth, but four large flat grinders in each jaw, and in the upper, two vast tusks, pointing forwards, and bending a little upwards; the largest of them imported into Britain are seven feet long, and weigh 152 pounds each. The eyes are small, and the ears long, broad and pendulous. The back is much arched. The legs are thick, and very clumsy and shapeless. The feet are undivided; but their margins are terminated by five round hoofs. The tail is like that of a hog. The colour of the skin is dusky, with a few scattered hairs on it; <HI>Pennant's synops.</HI></P>

<P>IF the human species be excepted, the Ele∣phant
is the most respectable animal in the
world. In size he surpasses all other terrestrial
creatures; and, by his intelligence, he makes as
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
near an approach to man as matter can approach
spirit<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Valet sensu et reliqua sagacitate ingenii excellit elephas; <HI>Arist. Hist. anim. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 46—Elephanti sunt natura mites et mansu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti. ut ad rationale animal proxime accedant; <HI>Strabo.</HI>—Vidi elephantos quosdam qui prudentiores mihi videbantur quam quibusdam in locis homines; <HI>Vartomannus, apud Gesner. cap. de Elephant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>. Of all animated beings, the elephant,
the dog, the beaver, and the ape, have the most
admirable instinct. But this instinct, which is
only a result of all the animal powers, both in∣ternal
and external, manifests itself by very dif∣ferent
effects in each of these species. Naturally,
and when left at full liberty, the dog is as cruel
and bloody as the wolf; but, amidst all this fe∣rocity
of disposition, there is one flexible point
which we have cherished. Hence the natural
dispositions of the dog differ not from those of
other rapacious animals, but by this point of sen∣sibility,
which renders him susceptible of affection
and attachment. It is from Nature that he de∣rives
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
this germ of sentiment, which man has
cultivated and expanded by living long and con∣stantly
in society with this animal. The dog a∣lone
was worthy of this distinguished regard;
for, being more susceptible of foreign impressions
than any other quadruped, all his relative powers
have been brought to perfection by his commerce
with man. His sensibility, his docility, his c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣rage,
his talents, and even his manners, are mo∣dified
and formed by the example and qualities
of his master. We ought not, therefore, to a∣scribe
to him all the powers he appears to possess.
His most brilliant qualities are borrowed from
us. He has acquired more than other animals,
because he is more capable of making acquisi∣tions.
Instead of having a repugnance to man,
he has a natural bias in favour of the human race.
This gentle sentiment, which is always alive, is
demonstrated by the desire of pleasing, and has
produced docility, fidelity, perpetual submission,
and, at the same time, the degree of attention
necessary for acting accordingly, and for giving
ready obedience to all the commands he re∣ceives.</P>
<P>The ape, on the contrary, is as untractable as
he is extravagant. His nature, in every point,
is equally stubborn. He has no relative sensibi∣lities,
no gratitude, no recollection of good treat∣ment
or of benefits received. Averse to the so∣ciety
of man, and to every kind of restraint, he
has a violent propensity to do every thing that
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
is hurtful or displeasing. But these real faults
are compensated by apparent perfections. In his
external figure, he resembles man: He has arms,
hands, and fingers. The use of these parts alone
renders him superior in address to other animals;
and the relations they give him to us, in simila∣rity
of movements and conformity of actions,
please and deceive us, and lead us to ascribe to
internal qualities, what depends solely on the
structure of his members.</P>
<P>The beaver, whose individual qualities seem
far inferior to those of the dog and ape, has, not∣withstanding,
received from Nature a gift almost
equivalent to that of speech. He makes him∣self
so well understood to his own species, that
they unite in society, act in concert, undertake
and execute large and long continued works;
and this social attachment, as well as the result
of their mutual intelligence, are more entitled to
our admiration than the address of the ape, or
the fidelity of the dog.</P>
<P>Hence the genius of the dog (if I may be
permitted to profane this term) is borrowed;
the ape has only the appearance of it; and the
talents of the beaver extend no farther than to
what regards himself and his associates. But
the elephant is superior to all the three; for in
him all their most exalted qualities are united.
In the ape, the hand is the principal organ of
address. The trunk of the elephant affords him
the same means of address as the ape. It serves
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
instead of an arm and a hand; and by it he is
enabled to raise and lay hold of small as well as
large objects, to carry them to his mouth, to
place them on his back, to embrace them fast,
or to throw them to a distance. He has, at the
same time, the docility of the dog, and, like that
animal, he is susceptible of gratitude, capable of
attachment, is easily accustomed to man, submits
less by force than good treatment, serves him
with zeal, fidelity, knowledge, &amp;c. In fine,
the elephant, like the beaver, loves the society
of his equals, and can make himself to be under∣stood
by them. They are often observed to as∣semble
together, to disperse, and to act in con∣cert;
and, if they receive no mutual edification,
if they carry on no common operation, it must,
perhaps, be ascribed to the want of room and of
tranquility; for men have been very antiently
multiplied in all the countries inhabited by the
elephant; he is, therefore, perpetually disturb∣ed,
and is no where a peaceable possessor of
sufficient space to establish a secure abode. We
have seen, that all these advantages are neces∣sary
to unfold the talents of the beaver, and that,
in every place frequented by men, he loses his
industry, and receives no edification from asso∣ciating.
Every being has its relative value in
Nature. To form a just estimation of the ele∣phant,
he must be allowed to possess the sagacity
of the beaver, the address of the ape, the sentiment
of the dog, together with the peculiar advanta∣ges
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
of strength, largeness, and long duration of
life. Neither should we overlook his arms or
tusks, which enable him to transfix and conquer
the lion. We should also consider, that the earth
shakes under his feet; that with his hand he
tears up trees<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Veteres proboscidem elephanti manum appellaverunt.—Eadem aliquoties nummum e terra tollentem vidi, et aliquan∣do detrahentem arboris ramum, quem viri viginti-quatuor fune trahentes ad humum flectere non potueramus; cum solus elephas tribus vicibus motum detrahebat; <HI>Vartomannus, apud Gesner. cap. de Elephanto.</HI>—Silvestres elephanti fagos, oleastros, et palmas dentibus subvertunt radicitus; <HI>Oppian.</HI>—Promuscis elephanti naris est qua cibum, tam siccum quam humidum, ille capiat, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>que perinde ac <HI>manu</HI> admoveat.

<PB N="7" REF="10"/>

coolness, and punctual obedience; that he pre∣serves

love<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Nec adulteria novere, nec ulla propter foeminas inter se praelia, caeteris animalibus pernicialia, non quia desit illis amoris vis, &amp;c.; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 5.—Mas quam impleverit coitu, eam amplius non tangit; <HI>Aristot.

his friends; that he never attacks any but those
who offend him; that he remembers favours as
long as injuries; that, having no appetite for
flesh, he feeds on vegetables alone, and is born
an enemy to no animal; and, in fine, that he
is universally beloved, because all animals re∣spect,
and none have any reason to fear him.</P>
<P>Men likewise, in all ages, have had a kind of
veneration for this first and grandest of terrestrial
creatures. The antients regarded him as a mi∣racle
of Nature; and, indeed, he is her highest
effort. But they have greatly exaggerated his
faculties. They have, without hesitation, ascri∣bed
to him intellectual powers and moral vir∣tues.
Pliny, Aelian, Solinus, Plutarch, and other
authors of a more modern date, have given to
these animals rational manners, a natural and
innate religion<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Hominum indigenarum linguam elephanti intelligunt; <HI>Aeilan, lib. 4. cap.</HI> 24.....

notion of the metempsycosis or transmigration of
souls, are still persuaded, that a body of majestic
as that of the elephant must be animated with
the soul of a great man or a king. In Siam<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">M. Constance conducted the ambassador to see the white ele∣phant, which is so esteemed in India, and has given rise to so many wars. He is very small, and so old, that he is all wrinkled. Several mandarins are appointed to take care of him, and his victuals are served up to him in large golden vessels.

When the King of Pegu gives audience, the four white e∣lephants are presented to him, who do him reverence by raising their trunks, opening their mouths, making three distinct cries, and then kneeling. When raised, they are led back to their stables, and there each of them are fed in large golden vessels. They are twice a day washed with water taken from a silver vessel..... During the time of their being dressed in this manner, they are under a canopy supported by eight domestics, in order to defend them from the heat of the sun.

regarded as the living <HI>manes</HI> of the Indian Em∣perors.
Each of these animals have a palace,
a number of domestics, golden vessels filled with
the choicest food, magnificent garments, and
they are absolved from all labour and servitude.

they bow the knee, and their salute is return∣ed
by the Monarch. By all these attentions,
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
honours, and marks of respect, they are flatter∣ed,
but not corrupted. This circumstance alone
should be sufficient to convince the Indians, that
these animals are not endowed with human
souls.</P>
<P>After removing the fabulous credulities of
antiquity, and the puerile fictions of supersti∣tion,
which still exist, the elephant, even to phi∣losophers,
possesses enough to make him be re∣garded
as a being of the first distinction. He
deserves to be known, and to be studied. We
shall, therefore, endeavour to write his history
with impartiality. We shall first consider him
in a state of nature, when he is perfectly free
and independent, and afterwards in a state of
servitude, when the will of his master is partly
the motive of his actions.</P>
<P>In a wild state, elephants are neither sangui∣nary
nor ferocious. Their dispositions are gentle,
and they make not a wrong use of their arms
or their strength; for they never exert them
but in defending themselves, or in protecting
their companions. Their manners are social;
for they are seldom seen wandering alone. They
generally march in troops, the oldest keeping
foremost<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Elephanti gregatim semper ingrediuntur; ducit agmen maximus natu, cogit aetate proximus. Amnes transituri mi∣nimes praemittunt, ne majorum incessu atterente alveum, crescat gurgitis altitudo; <HI>Plin. hist, nat, lib. 8. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE>, and the next in age bringing up the
rear. The young and the feeble are placed in
the middle. The mothers carry their young
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
firmly embraced in their trunks. They observe
not this order, except in perilous marches,
when they want to pasture on cultivated fields.
In the deserts and forests, they travel with less
precaution, but without separating so far as to
exceed the possibility of receiving assistance
from one another. Some of them, however,
occasionally wander, or lag behind the troop;
and it is these alone whom the hunters dare
venture to attack; for a little army is necessary
to assail a whole troop<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">I still tremble when I think of the danger to which we exposed ourselves in pursuing a wild elephant; for, though there were only ten or a dozen of us, the one half of which were not well armed, if we could have come up with him, we would have been foolish enough to make the attack. We thought we might kill him by two or three shot. But I af∣terwards saw that this business requires two or three hun∣dred men; <HI>Voyage de Guinée, par Guillaume Bosman, p.</HI> 436.</NOTE>; and they are never
vanquished but at the expence of several lives.
It is even dangerous to do them the smallest in∣jury<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Solent elephanti magno numero confertim incedere, et si quemdam obvium habuerint, vel devitant, vel illi-cedunt; at si quemdam injuria afficere velit, proboscide sublatum in terram dejicit, pedibus deculcans donec mortuum reli∣querit; <HI>Leonis Africani Descript.

for they run straight upon the offen∣der,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
and, though the weight of their bodies be
great, their steps are so long that they easily
overtake the most agile man. They then trans∣fix
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with their tusks, or, laying hold of him
with their trunk, throw him against a stone, and
put an end to his existence by trampling him
under their feet. But it is only when provoked
that they kill men in this manner, and never
injure those who do not disturb them. But,
as they are extremely suspicious and sensible of
injuries, it is proper to avoid them; and the
travellers who frequent the countries inhabited
by elephants, kindle fires during the night, and
beat drums to prevent their approach. When
they have been once attacked by men, or have
fallen into a snare, they are said never to forget
it; but take every opportunity of revenge. As
their sense of smelling is, perhaps, more perfect
than that of any other animal, the smell of a
man strikes them at a great distance, and they
can easily follow him by the scent. The an∣tients
relate, that the elephants tear the grass off
the ground upon which the hunters have pas∣sed,
and that they hand it about to each other
for the purpose of receiving information con∣cerning
the passage and march of the enemy.
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
These animals love the banks of rivers<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Elephanti naturae proprium est roscida loca et mollia amare et aquam desiderare, ubi versari maxime studet; ita ut animal palustre nominari possit; <HI>Aelian. lib. 4. cap.</HI> 24.</NOTE>, deep
vallies, and shady moist places. They cannot
dispense with water, which they trouble before
drinking. They often fill their trunk with wa∣ter,
either to carry it to their mouth, or solely
for refreshing their nose, and amusing themselves
by throwing it back into the river, or besprink∣ling
it around. They cannot support cold, and
likewise suffer by extreme heat. To avoid the
ardour of the sun's rays, they retire into the most
shady recesses of the forests. They frequently
take to the water: The enormous size of their
bodies rather aids than retards their swimming;
for they sink not proportionably so deep as o∣ther
animals; and the length of their trunk,
which they hold up in the air, and through
which they respire, removes from them all ap∣prehensions
of being drowned.</P>
<P>Roots, herbs, leaves, and tender wood, are
their common food. They likewise eat grains
and fruits. But they disdain flesh and fish<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The most savage of these animals eat no flesh, but live solely upon leaves, branches, and twigs of trees, which they break off with their trunk, and even brouse pretty strong wood; <HI>Voyage de Fr. Pyrard. tom. 2. p.</HI> 367.</NOTE>.
When one of them discovers a plentiful pas∣ture, he calls to
the others, and invites them to eat with him<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">Cum eis caetera pabula defecerint, radices effodiunt, quibus pascuntur; e quibus primus qui aliquam praedam re∣pererit, regreditur ut et suos gregales advocet, et in praedae communionem deducat; <HI>Aelian. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 56.</NOTE>. As they require a vast quan∣tity
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
of forage, they often change their place of
pasturing; and, when they come upon cultiva∣ted
fields, they do incredible damage. Their bo∣dies
being of an enormous weight, they destroy
ten times more with their feet than they use for
food, which generally amounts to one hundred
and fifty pounds of grass a day; and, as they
always go in troops, they lay a whole country
waste in a single hour. For this reason, the
Indians and Negroes use every artifice to pre∣vent
the approach of these animals, or to fright
them away. They make great noises, and
kindle large fires round their cultivated fields.
But, notwithstanding these precautions, the ele∣phants
sometimes pay them a visit, drive off the
domestic cattle, put the men to flight, and, not
unfrequently, overturn their limber habitations.
It is difficult to scare them; and they are not
susceptible of fear. Nothing can surprise them,
or stop their progress, but artificial fires<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">When the elephant is enraged, nothing stops his career but artificial fires. When fighting, the same means are em∣ployed to disengage them from the combat; <HI>Relat. par The∣ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, tom. 3. p.</HI> 133.—The Portugnese know no other mode of defending themselves against the elephant, but throwing squibs or torches in his eyes; <HI>Voyage de Feynes, p.</HI> 89.—In the Mogul empire, elephants are made to combat with each other.

separate from each other; for they generally act
in concert, whether they attack, march, or fly.</P>
<P>When the females come in season, this attach∣ment
to society yields to a stronger passion.
The troop separates into pairs, which love had
previously formed. They unite from choice,
steal off in quest of retirement, and their march
seems to be preceded by love, and followed by
modesty; for all their pleasures are accompanied
with the profoundest mystery. They have never
been detected in their amours. They anxiously
avoid the presence or inspection of their neigh∣bours;
and know, perhaps, better than the hu∣man
race, how to enjoy pleasure in secret, and to
be entirely occupied with a single object. They
search for the deepest solitudes of the woods,
that they may give full vent, without distur∣bance
or reserve, to all the impulses of Nature<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Elephanti solitudines petunt coituri, et praecipue secus flumina; <HI>Arist. Hist. Anim. lib. 5. cap.</HI> 2.—Pudore nunquam nisi in abdito coeunt; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE>,

There is no appearance, however, of the horns
or tusks. Soon after, they begin to shoot; and,
at the age of six months, they are several inches
long<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">Thomas Lopes, apud Gesnerum, cap. de Elephanto.</NOTE>. The animal is then larger than an ox, and
the tusks continue to grow and enlarge till the
most advanced age, provided the creature enjoys
health and liberty; for it is not to be imagined
what changes may be introduced into the tem∣perament
and habits of the elephant by slavery
and unnatural food. They are easily tamed, in∣structed,
and rendered submissive; and, as they
are stronger and more intelligent than any other
animal, their service is more ready, more exten∣sive,
and more useful. But the disgust arising
from their situation is probably never eradicated:
For, though they feel, from time to time, the
most lively impressions of love, they neither in∣termix
nor produce in a domestic state. Their
constrained passion degenerates into fury. Being
unable to gratify themselves without witnesses,
they fret, lose patience, and, at last, their indig∣nation
becomes so violent, that the strongest
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
chains, and fetters of every kind, are necessary
to repress their movements, and to break their
rage. Hence they differ from all other domestic
animals, who are managed by men as if they
had no will of their own. They are not of the
number of those born slaves, which we propa∣gate,
mutilate, or multiply, purely to answer our
own purposes. Here the individual alone is a
slave. The species remains independent, and
uniformly refuses to augment the stores of their
tyrants. This circumstance shows the elephant
to be endowed with sentiments superior to the
nature of common brutes. To feel the most
ardent passion, and, at the same time, to deny
the gratification of it, to experience all the fury
of love, and not to transgress the laws of mode∣sty,
are, perhaps, the highest efforts of human
virtue; and yet, in these majestic animals, they
are only common and uniform exertions. The
indignation they feel, because they cannot be
gratified in secret, becomes stronger than the
passion of love, suspends and destroys the effects
of it, and, at the same time, excites that fury,
which, during these paroxysms, renders them
more dangerous than any wild animal.</P>
<P>We are inclined, were it possible, to doubt of
this fact; but all naturalists, historians, and tra∣vellers,
concur in assuring us, that the elephants
never produce in a domestic state<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">It is remarkable, that the male never covers the female, though she indicates the strongest marks of desire, in situations where they may be exposed to the observation of men; <HI>Voyage de Fr.

<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
of India keep great numbers of elephants;
and, after many fruitless attempts to multiply
them like other domestic animals, they found it
necessary to separate the males from the females,
in order to diminish the frequency of those in∣effectual
ardours, which are always accompanied
with fury. Hence there are no domestic ele∣phants
which have not formerly been wild:
and the manner of taking, taming, and render∣ing
them submissive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I went to see the grand hunting of the elephants, which was performed in the following manner: The King sent a great number of women into the woods; and, when the report was brought that they had discovered a troop of ele∣phants, he despatched thirty or forty thousand men, who made a large circle round the place. They posted themselves in fours, at the distance of twenty or twenty-five feet from each other, and at every station they kindled a fire, which was raised about three feet above the surface of the earth. There was another circle composed of elephants trained to war, distant from one another about a hundred or a hundred and fifty paces; and, in such places as the wild elephants might most easily escape, the war elephants were posted closser. There were cannons in several places, which are dis∣charged when the wild elephants attempt to force a passage; for they are terrified at fire. This circle is daily diminished, and at last becomes so small, that the fires are not above five or six paces distant. As the elephants hear a great noise all round them, they dare not fly, though it is not uncommon for some of them to make their escape; for I was told that ten of them got off in one day. When the hunters want to seize them, they are made to enter a place surrounded with stakes, where there are also some trees, between which a man can easily pass. There is another circle of war elephants and soldiers, into which some men enter mounted on ele∣phants, who are extremely dexterous in throwing ropes round the hind legs of these animals. When fixed in this manner, the wild elephant is put between two tame elephants, and a third one is appointed to push him behind in such a manner as obliges him to go forward; and, when he grows mischievous, the others give him blows with their trunks. He is then led off into captivity; and the others are seized in the same manner. I saw ten of them taken. The King was pre∣sent, and gave every necessary order; <HI>Relation de l'Ambassade de M. Chevalier de Chaumont à la cour du Roi de Siam, p.</HI> 91.</NOTE>, merits particular atten∣tion.
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
In the midst of the forest, and in the
neighbourhood of places frequented by the ele∣phants,
a spot is chosen, and surrounded with
strong palisades. The largest trees of the wood
serve as the principal stakes, to which are fixed
cross bars that support the other stakes. A large
opening is left, through which the elephant may
enter; and over this door there is a trap, or ra∣ther
it receives a strong bar, which is shut after
the animal passes. To draw him into this en∣closure,
the hunters go in quest of him: They
carry along with them into the forest a tamed
female in season; and, when they imagine them∣selves
to be near enough to be heard, her gover∣nour
makes her utter the cry of love. The wild
male instantly replies, and hastens to join her.
She is then made to march towards the enclosure,
repeating the cry from time to time. She ar∣rives
first; and the male, following her by the
scent, enters by the same port. As soon as he
perceives the hunters, and sees himself surround∣ed,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
his ardour vanishes, and is changed into
fury. Ropes and fetters are thrown round
his legs and trunk. Two or three tamed ele∣phants,
conducted by men expert in that busi∣ness,
are brought to him, and they endeavour to
fix him to one of the animals. In fine, by ad∣dress,
by force, by torture and caresses, he is
tamed in a few days. I will not enter into a
more particular detail, but content myself with
quoting from those travellers who have been
eye-witnesses of the hunting of elephants,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At a quarter of a league from Luovo, there is a kind of large amphitheatre, of a rectangular figure, surrounded with high terrass walls, upon which the spectators are placed. Within these walls, there is a palisade of strong posts fixed in the ground, behind which the hunters retire when pur∣sued by the enraged elephants. A large opening is left on the side next the fields, and, opposite to it, next the city, there is a smaller one, which leads to a narrow alley, through which an elephant can pass with difficulty, and this alley terminates in a large shade where the operation of taming is finished.</P>
<P>When the day destined for the chace arrives, the hunters enter the woods, mounted on female elephants trained to this exercise. The men cover themselves with leaves of trees, to prevent their being observed by the wild elephants. When they have advanced into the forest, and think that some ele∣phants may be in the neighbourhood, they make the females utter certain cries, fitted to allure the males, who instantly reply by frightful roarings. Then the hunters, when they perceive the elephants at a proper distance, return, and lead the females gently back toward the amphitheatre above de∣scribed. The wild elephants never fail to follow. The male, which we saw tamed, entered the enclosure spontaneously a∣long with the females, and the passage was immediately shut. The females continue their march across the amphitheatre, and filed off one by one into the narrow alley at the o∣ther end. The wild elephant, who had followed them all along, stopt at the entrance of this defile. Every method was tried to make him enter. The females, who were now beyond the alley, were made to cry. Some Siamese irritated him, by clapping their hands, and crying <HI>pat, pat.</HI> Others teazed him with long poles armed with sharp points; and, when pursued, they slip through between the posts, and conceal themselves behind the palisade, which the elephant cannot surmount. Lastly, after having pursued several hunters in vain, he singles out one, whom he sets upon with extreme fury. This man runs into the narrow alley, and the elephant follows him. But, he no sooner enters than he perceives himself to be in a snare; for the man escapes, and two portcullises, one before and another behind, are instantly let fall; so that, being unable either to advance or retreat, the animal makes the most astonishing efforts, and raises the most hideous cries. The hun∣ters endeavour to sooth him by throwing pails of water on his body, by rubbing him with leaves, by pouring oil upon his ears, and by bringing to him tamed elephants, both male and female, who caress him with their trunks. They fix ropes, however, round his body and hind legs, to enable them to drag him out, and they continue to throw water on his trunk and body, in order to refresh him. In fine, a tamed elephant, accustomed to instruct noviciates, is made to approach him. The former is mounted by a servant, who makes the animal advance and retire, to show the wild elephant that he has no∣thing to fear, and that he may go out. The port is then o∣pened, and he follows his neighbour to the end of the alley. When there, two elephants are tied, one to each side of him, another marches before, leads him in the way they want him to go, while a third pushes him behind with its head, till they arrive at a kind of shade, where he is tied to a large poll, which turns round like the capstan of a ship. There he is left till next day, to allow his rage to subside. But, while he frets around this post, a Bramin, one of those Indian priests who are ex∣tremely numerous in Siam, dressed in white, a∣pproaches the a∣nimal, mounted on an elephant, turns gently round him, and bedews him with a consecrated water, which the priest carries in a golden vessel. They believe that, by this ceremony, the elephant loses his natural ferocity, and is rendered fit for the King's service. Next day, he walks along with his enslaved neighbours; and, at the end of fifteen days, he is complete∣ly tamed; <HI>Premier Voyage du P. Tachard, p.</HI> 298.</P>
<P>They had no sooner alighted from their horses, and mounted the elephants which were prepared for them, than the King ap∣peared, accompanied with a great number of Mandarins, riding on elephants of war. They all proceeded about a league into the wood, when they arrived at the place where the wild ele∣phants were enclosed. This was a square park, of three or four hundred geometrical paces, the sides of which were fenced with large stakes; in which, however, considerable openings were left at certain distances. It contained fourteen large elephants. As soon as the royal train arrived, a circle was formed, consisting of a hundred war elephants, which were placed round the park to prevent the wild ones from forcing through the palisades. We were stationed behind this fence, near the King. A dozen of the strongest tame elephants were pushed into the park, each of them being mounted by two men, furnished with large ropes and nooses, the ends of which were fixed to the elephants they rode. They first ran against the elephant they wished to seize, who, seeing himself pursued, endeavoured to force the barrier and make his escape. But the whole was blockaded by the war-elephants, who pushed him back; and, in his course, the hunters, mounted on the tame elephants, threw their nooses fo dexterously upon the spots where it behoved the animal to place his feet, that the whole were seized in the space of an hour. Each elephant was then bound with ropes, and two tame ones placed on each side of him, by means of which, he is tamed in fifteen days; <HI>Idem, p.</HI> 340.</P>
<P>A few days after, we had the pleasure of being present at the hunting of elephants. The Siamese are very dexterous at this species of hunting, which they have several modes of perform∣ing. The easiest, and not the least entertaining, is executed by means of female elephants. When a female is in season, she is conducted to the forest of Luovo, Her guide rides on her back, and covers himself with leaves, to prevent his being perceived by the wild elephants. The cries of the tame female, which she never fails to set up upon a certain signal given by the guide, collect all the elephants within the reach of hearing, who soon follow her. The guide, taking advantage of their mutual cries, returns slowly toward Luovo with all his train, and enters an enclosure made of large stakes, about a quarter of a league from the city, and pretty near the forest. A great troop of elephants were, in this manner, brought together; but one of them only was large, and it was very difficult to seize and to tame him.—The guide who conducted the female went out of the enclosure by a narrow passage, in the form of an alley, and about the length of an elephant. Each end of this alley was provided with a portcullis, which was easily raised or let down. All the young elephants followed the female at different times. But a passage so narrow alarmed the large one, who always drew back. The female was made to return several times; he uni∣formly followed her to the port; but, as if he soresaw his loss of liberty, he would never pass. Several Siamese, who were in the park, then advanced, and endeavoured to force him, by goading him with sharp pointed poles. The elephant, being en∣raged by this treatment, pursued them with such fury and quick∣ness, that not one of them would have escaped, had they not nimbly retired behind the stakes of the palisade, against which the ferocious creature broke its large tusks three or four times. In the heat of the pursuit, one of those who attacked him most briskly, and who was most keenly pursued, run into the alley, which the elephant entered, in order to kill him. But the ani∣mal no sooner fell into the snare, than the Siamese escaped by a small passage, and the two portcullises were instantly let down. The elephant struggled much; but he found himself obliged to remain in his prison. To appease him, they threw pailfulls of water on his body. Ropes, however, were put round his legs and neck. After being fatigued for some time, he was brought out by means of two tame elephants who drew him forward with ropes, while other two pushed him behind, till he was fixed to a large post, round which he could only turn. In an hour after, he became so tractable, that a Siamese mounted on his back; and next day he was let loose, and conducted to the stables along with the others; <HI>Second voyage du P.

When the elephant enters, the hunters, from the top of a tree, draw up the door, by means of a rope. They then descend and slay the animal with arrows. But if, by accident, they miss their aim, and the animal escapes from the enclosure, he kills every man he meets; <HI>L' Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.—There are different modes of hunting elephants. In some places, caltrops are spread on the ground, by means of which the animals fall into ditches, from whence, after being properly entangled, they are easily drawn out. In others, a tame female is led into a narrow defile, and allures the male to approach by her cries. When he arrives, the hunt∣ers shut him up by barriers, which they have in readiness for the purpose; and, though he finds the female on her back, he copulates with her, contrary to the practice of other quadru∣peds. After this, he endeavours to retire. But, while he goes about in quest of an outlet, the hunters, who are upon a wall, or some elevated situation, throw ropes and chains of different dimensions, by which they so entangle his trunk and the rest of his body, that they can approach him without danger; and, af∣ter taking some necessary precautions, they carry him off, ac∣companied with two tame elephants, to show him a proper ex∣ample, or to chastise him if he rebels.—There are many o∣ther methods of hunting elephants; for every country has its own mode; <HI>Relation d'un voyage par Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 131.—The inhabitants of Ceylon dig pretty deep ditches, which they cover with thin planks and straw. During the night, the ele∣phants, having no suspicion of the deceit, come upon the planks, and fall into the ditch, from which they are unable to escape, but would infallibly perish by hunger, if victuals were not brought to them by slaves, to whom they gradually become ac∣customed, and at last are rendered so tame, that they are brought to Goa, and other adjacent countries, to gain their own livelihood and that of their masters; <HI>Divers memoires touchant les Indes Orientales, premier discours, tom. 2. p. 257.

This rod, which would kill any other animal, is hardly sufficient to make an im∣pression on the skin of the elephant, or to keep him in subjection when irritated; <HI>Voyage de Pietro della Valle, tom. 4. p.</HI> 247.—Two servants, the one mounted on the neck, and the other on the crupper, manage the elephant, by means of a large iron hook; <HI>Premier voyage du P.

In elephants, the duration of life compensates
their sterility; and, if it be true that they live

produce forty in this period. Besides, as they

They are, perhaps, still more numerous
in all the southern regions of Africa, excepting
certain cantons which they have abandoned, be∣cause
they are totally occupied by men. Ele∣phants
are faithful to their country, and never
change their climate; for, though they can live
in temperate regions, yet they appear not to
have ever attempted to establish themselves, or
even to travel into these climates. They were
formerly unknown in Europe. Homer, though
he mentions ivory<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Herodotus is the most antient author who mentions ivory to have been a matter derived from elephants teeth; <HI>Vid Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE>, seems not to have been
acquainted with the animal by which that sub∣stance
is produced. Alexander the Great was
the first European who ever mounted an ele∣phant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elephantes ex Europaeis primus Alexander habuit, cum subegisset Porum; <HI>Pausanias, in Atticis.</HI></NOTE>.
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
Those which he took from Porus, he
caused to be brought to Greece; and they were,
perhaps, the same which Pyrrhus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Manius Curius Dentatus, victo Pyrrho, primum in tri∣umpho elephantom duxit; <HI>Seneca de brevitate vitae, cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE>, several years
after, employed against the Romans in the Ta∣rentine
war, and with which Curius came tri∣umphant
into Rome. Annibal afterwards trans∣ported
elephants from Africa, made them pass
the Alps, and conducted them almost to the
gates of Rome.</P>
<P>The Indians, from a period beyond the re∣cords
of history, have employed elephants in
war<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">From time immemorial, the Kings of Ceylon, of Pegu, and of Aracan, have used elephants in war. Naked sabres were tied to their trunks, and on their backs were fixed small wooden castles, which contained five or six men armed with javelins, and other weapons. They contribute greatly to disorder the enemy; but they are easily terrified by the sight of fire; <HI>Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie del Indes, tom. 7.—Voyage de Schonten, p.</HI> 32.</NOTE>. Among these undisciplined nations, the
elephants formed their best troop; and, as long
as steel weapons alone were employed, they ge∣nerally
decided the fate of battles. We learn
from history, however, that the Greeks and
Romans were soon accustomed to these monsters
of war. They opened their ranks to let them
pass, and directed all their weapons, not against
the animals, but their conductors, who used all
their efforts to turn and appease those which had
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
separated from the rest of the troop. Now that
fire has become the element of war, and the
chief instrument of death, elephants, who are
terrified both at the noise and flame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elephants are afraid of fire; and, therefore, since the use of fire-arms, these animals are of no value in war. Some of those brought from Ceylon are not so dastardly; but it is only after being daily accustomed to the firing of guns, and to having crackers thrown among their feet; <HI>Voyage de Fr. Bernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 65.</NOTE>, would be
more dangerous than useful in our combats.
The Indian Kings still arm elephants in their
wars; but this practice is designed more for
show than utility. One advantage, however, is
derived from them. Like every other military
order, they serve the purpose of enslaving their
equals, and are, accordingly, used in taming the
wild elephants. The most powerful monarchs
of India have not now above two hundred war
elephants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Few people in India have elephants. Even their nobles have not many; and the Great Mogul keeps not above five hundred for his household, and for transporting his baggage and women, in wattled cages or baskets. I have been assured, that he has not above two hundred war elephants, part of which are employed in carrying small pieces of artillery; <HI>Relation d'un voyage, far Thevenot, tom.</HI> 3. p. 132.</NOTE>. They keep many others for the
purposes of labour, and for transporting their
women in large cages covered with foliage. It
is a very safe mode of riding; for the elephant
never stumbles: But, to be accustomed to his
brisk and swinging movements, requires time and
practice. The neck is the best seat; for there
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
the succussions are not so hard as on the shoul∣ders,
back, or crupper. But, for the purposes of
war, or of hunting, each elephant is always
mounted by several men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all animals, the elephant is the most serviceable in war; for he can easily carry four men armed with muskets, bows, or spears; <HI>Recueil des voyages de la Campagnie des Indes de Hollande; second voyage de Vander Hagen, tom. 2. p.</HI> 53.</NOTE>. The conductor
rides astraddle on the neck, and the hunters or
combatants sit on the other parts of the body.</P>
<P>In those happy regions where cannon,
and other murdering engines, are imperfectly
known, they still fight with elephants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the elephants are led to war they serve two pur∣poses; for they either carry small wooden towers, from the top of which some soldiers fight, or they have swords fixed to their trunks with iron chains, and in this manner they are let loose against the enemy, whom they assail with courage, and would unquestionably cut to pieces, if they were not re∣pelled by spears which throw out fire; for, as elephants are terrified at fire, this artifice is employed to put them to flight; <HI>Voyage d'Orient, par le P. Philippe. p.</HI> 367.</NOTE>. At
Cochin, and other parts of Malabar<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In Cochin, as well as in other parts of Malabar, no hor∣ses are used in war. Those who fight not on foot, are mount∣ed on elephants, of which there are great numbers in the mountains; and these mountain elephants are the largest in India; <HI>Relation d'un voyage, par Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 261.</NOTE>, horses are

Pegu, where the King and great Lords always
ride upon elephants; At festivals, they are pre∣ceded
and followed by a numerous train of these
animals; pompously adorned with pieces of
shining metal, and covered with rich stuffs.
Their tusks are ornamented with rings of gold
and silver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have seen elephants whose teeth were extremely large and beautiful. In some, they are more than four feet long, and garnished with rings of gold, silver, and copper; <HI>Premier voyage du P. Tachard, p.</HI> 273.—The grandeur of the princes consists in the number of elephants they are able to keep, which is the chief source of their expence. The Great Mo∣gul has several thousands of them. The King of Madura, the Lords of Narzinga and of Bisnagar, and the Kings of Naires and of Manful, have several hundreds, which they di∣stinguish into three classes. The largest are destined for the service of the Prince. Their harness is extremely rich. They are covered with cloth embroidered with gold, and studded with pearls. Their teeth are adorned with fine gold and silver, and sometimes with diamonds. Those of a middle size are employed in war; and the least are used for common labour; <HI>Voyage du P. Vincent Marie de Ste Catherine de Sienne, chap</HI> II.</NOTE>; their ears and cheeks are painted;
they are crowned with garlands; and a num∣ber
of little bells are fixed to different parts of
their body. They seem to delight in rich at∣tire;
for they are chearful and caressing in pro∣portion
to the number of their ornaments. But
it is only in the southern parts of India where
the elephants have acquired this degree of po∣lish.
In Africa, it is with difficulty that they
can be tamed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of Congo have not the art of taming elephants, which are very mischievous, take crocodiles with their trunks, and throw them to a great distance; Il <HI>Genio vog, del Conte Aurelio, tom. 2. p.</HI> 473.</NOTE>. The Asiatics, who have been
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
very antiently civilized, made the education of
the elephant a kind of art, and have instructed
and modified him according to their own man∣ners.
But, of all the African nations, the Car∣thaginians
alone formerly trained the elephants
to war; because, at the splendid period of their
republic, they were perhaps the most civilized
people of the East. There are now no wild ele∣phants
in all that part of Africa on this side of
Mount Atlas. There are even sew beyond
these mountains, till we arrive at the river Sene∣gal.
But they are numerous in Senegal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elephants, or which I daily saw great numbers along the banks of the river Senegal, no longer astonished me. On the fifth day of November, I walked into the woods opposite to the village of Dagana, where I found a number of their fresh tracks, which I followed near two leagues, and at last disco∣vered five of these animals; three of them lay wallowing, like hogs, in their own soil, and the fourth was standing with its cub, eating the branches of an acacia tree, which they had broken off. By comparing the animal with the height of the tree, I perceived that its crupper was at least eleven or twelve feet high, and its tusks near three feet long. Though my presence did not disturb them, I thought it proper to retire. In pursuing my rout, I met with the impressions of their feet, which mea∣sured near a foot and a half in diameter. Their dung, which resembled that of a horse, formed balls seven or eight inches thick; <HI>Voyage au Senegal, par M. Adanson, p.75.</HI> See also, <HI>Voyage de la Maire, p</HI> 97.</NOTE>, in

From Anta to Acra, very few are found, but in the places men∣tioned above, because the countries between Anta and Acra have been a long time tolerably peopled, except that of Fetu, which, for five or fix years, has been almost deserted, and the ele∣phants, for that reason, have taken possession of it.

<P>After comparing the testimonies of travellers
and historians, it appears that elephants are more
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
numerous and common in Africa than in Asia.
They are also less suspicious, and retire not to
such distant solitudes. They seem to know the
unskilfulness and debility of the men who inha∣bit
this part of the world; for they daily ap∣proach
the villages without discovering any ap∣prehensions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elephants often pass the night in the villages, and are so little afraid of frequented places, that, instead of turning when they perceive the houses of the Negroes, they march straight forward, and overturn them like nut-shells; <HI>Voyage de la Maire, p.</HI> 98.</NOTE>.
They treat the Negroes with
that natural and supercilious indifference which
they entertain for all animals. They regard
not man as a powerful or formidable being, but
as a crafty creature, who knows only how to
lay snares in their way, but who dare not attack
them face to face, and is ignorant of the art of
reducing them to slavery, It is by this art alone,
which has been long known in the Eastern na∣tions,
that the number of these animals has been
diminished. The wild elephants, which these
people render domestic, become by captivity so
many voluntary eunuchs, in whom the sources
of generation are daily dried up. But, in
Africa, where the elephants are all free, the
species is supported, and might even increase,
though more of them were destroyed; because
every individual is constantly labouring to re∣pair
the waste. I perceive no other cause to
which this difference of number can be ascribed;
for it appears, from every consideration, that the
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
south of India and the East of Africa, are the
countries most congenial to the nature of the
elephant. He is there much larger and strong∣er
than in Guiney, or any other western region
of Africa. He dreads excessive heat, and never
inhabits the burning sands of the desert. Nei∣ther
is the species so numerous in the country of
the Negroes, as along the rivers; and they are
never found in the mountainous parts of Afri∣ca.
But, in India, the strongest and most coura∣geous
of the species, and which have the largest
tusks, are called <HI>Mountain Elephants:</HI> They in∣habit
the elevated parts of the country, where,
the air being more temperate, the waters less
impure, and the food more wholesome, they ac∣quire
all the perfections of which their nature
is capable.</P>
<P>In general, the elephants of Asia exceed, in
size, strength, &amp;c. those of Africa; and those
of Ceylon, in particular, are superior to all those
of Asia, not only in magnitude, but in courage
and intelligence. These qualities they perhaps
derive from a more perfect education. Howe∣ver
this may be, all travellers have celebrated
the elephants of this island<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">The elephants of Ceylon are preferred to all others, be∣cause they have most courage..... The Indians say, that all the other elephants respect those of Ceylon; <HI>Relation d'un voyage par Thevenot, p.</HI> 261—The elephants of Ceylon are the boldest of the species; <HI>Voyage de Bernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 65.—The best and most intelligent elephants come from the island of Ceylon; <HI>Re∣cueil des voyages, tom.</HI> 1. p. 413; <HI>tom. 2. p.</HI> 256.; <HI>tom. 4. p.</HI> 363.—In Ceylon the elephants are numerous, and more generous and noble than any others....

<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
of the earth is variegated with mountains, which
are more elevated in proportion as they advance
toward the centre of the island, and where the
heat, though great, is not so excessive as in Se∣negal,
Guiney, and the other western parts of
Africa. The antients, who knew nothing of
this quarter of the world, except the territo∣ries
situated between Mount Atlas and the Me∣diterranean,
had remarked, that the Lybian ele∣phants
were much smaller than those of India<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Indicum (elephantum) A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri pavent, nec contueri audent; nam et major Indicis magnitudo est; <HI>Plin. Hist. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE>.
There are now no elephants in that part of Afri∣ca;
which proves what was alledged under the
article <HI>Lion</HI><NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">See above, vol. 5. p. 66.</NOTE>, that men are at present more nu∣merous
there than they were in the days of the
Carthaginians. The elephants have retired in
proportion to the disturbance they have met with
from the human species. But, in travelling
through the climates of Africa, they have not
changed their nature; for the elephants of Se∣negal,
Guiney, &amp;c. are still much smaller than
those of India.</P>
<P>The strength of these animals is proportioned
to their magnitude. The Indian elephants carry
<PB N="49" REF="43"/>
with ease three or four thousand weight<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Relation d'un voyage, per Thevenot, p. 261.</NOTE>: The
smaller, or those of Africa, can easily raise with
their trunk a weight of two hundred pounds, and
place it on their own shoulders<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The elephant raises with his trunk a weight of two hun∣dred pounds, and places it on his own shoulders..... He draws up into his trunk one hundred and fifty pounds of water, which he squirts to a considerable height in the air; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol. tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>. They draw
up into their trunks large quantities of water,
which they squirt into the air, or all around, to
the distance of several fathoms. They can carry
a weight of above a thousand pounds on their
tusks. They use their trunk for breaking bran∣ches,
and their tusks for tearing up trees. The
greatness of their strength may be still farther
conceived from the quickness of their move∣ments,
compared with the magnitude of their
bodies. At their ordinary step, they cut as
much ground as a horse at a gentle trot; and
they run as fast as a horse can gallop: But, in
a state of liberty, they never run, unless when
enraged or terrified. Domestic elephants are
generally walked, and they perform easily, and
without fatigue, a journey of fifteen or twenty
leagues in a day; and, when pushed, they can
travel thirty or forty leagues a-day<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">When an elephant is pushed, he can perform, in one day, as much as a man generally does in six; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol. tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>. Their
tread is heard at a great distance, and they may
be easily followed by the tracks of their feet,
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
which, in soft ground, measure fifteen or eighteen
inches in diameter.</P>
<P>A domestic elephant performs more work than
perhaps six horses<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">The price of elephants is very high. They are some∣times sold from a thousand pagodas of gold to fifteen thou∣sand roupees, that is, from nine or ten thousand livres to thirty thousand; <HI>Notes de M. de Bussy.</HI>—At Ceylon, an elephant is worth, at least, eight thousand <HI>pardaons;</HI> and, when very large, he brings twelve, and even fifteen thousand pardaons; <HI>Hist de l'Isle de Ceylon, par Ribeyro, p.</HI> 144.</NOTE>; but he requires from his
master much care, and a great deal of good vic∣tuals,
which cost about four francs, or a hundred
pence a day<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The food of an elephant costs about half a pistole each day; <HI>Relation d'un voyage par Thevenot, p.</HI> 261.—Tamed ele∣phants are very delicate in their feeding. They require rice well boiled, and seasoned with butter and sugar, which is given to them in large balls. They devour daily a hundred pounds of rice, beside leaves of trees, particularly those of the Indian fig, called <HI>bananas</HI> or <HI>plantane,</HI> which are given them by way of refreshment; <HI>Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 2. p.</HI> 367.—See also, <HI>Voyages de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p.</HI> 250;—and <HI>Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom, 1. p.</HI> 473.</NOTE>. He is generally fed with rice,
raw or boiled, and mixed with water. To keep
him in full vigour, he is said to require daily a
hundred pounds of rice, beside fresh herbage to
cool him; for he is subject to be over-heated,
and must be led to the water twice or thrice a
day for the benefit of bathing. He easily learns
to bathe himself. He takes the water up in his
trunk, carries it to his mouth, drinks part of it,
and, by elevating his trunk, allows the remain∣der
to run over every part of his body. To
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
give an idea of the labour he performs, it is suf∣ficient
to remark, that all the tuns, sacks, and
bales, transported from one place to another in
India, are carried by elephants; that they carry
burdens on their bodies, their necks, their tusks,
and even in their mouths, by giving them the
end of a rope, which they hold fast with their
teeth; that, uniting sagacity to strength, they
never break or injure any thing committed to
their charge; that, from the margins of the wa∣ters,
they put these bundles into boats without
wetting them, laying them down gently, and ar∣ranging
them where they ought to be placed;
that, when disposed in the places where their
masters direct, they try with their trunk whether
the goods are properly stowed; and, if a tun or
cask rolls, they go, of their own accord, in quest
of stones to prop and render it firm.</P>
<P>When the elephant is properly managed,
though in captivity, he lives a long time; and,
it is probable, that, in a state of liberty, his life
is still longer. Some authors affirm, that he

elephants live a hundred and twenty, or a
hundred and thirty years, those which are free,
and enjoy all the conveniencies and rights
of Nature, ought to exist at least two hun∣dred.
Besides, if they go two years with young,
and require thirty before they obtain their full
growth, we may, with still more certainty, con∣clude,
that their life extends beyond the period
we have affixed. But captivity abridges their
existence less than the injuries arising from
change of climate. Whatever care is bestowed
on him, the elephant lives not long in tempe∣rate,
and still shorter in cold countries. That
which the King of Portugal sent to Louis XIV.
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
in 1668<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir à l'histoire des animaux, part. 3. p. 101. et 127.</NOTE>, and which was then only four years
old, died in the month of January 1681, at the
age of seventeen, and lived at Versailles only
thirteen years, though he was sed plentifully, and
managed with the greatest attention. He had
daily eighty pounds of bread, twelve pints of
wine, and two pails of pottage, mixed with four
or five pounds of bread; and, every second day,
in place of pottage, he had two pails of boiled
rice, without reckoning what was given him by
visitors. He had, besides, a sheaf of corn every
day for his amusement; for, after eating the
ears, he made a kind of whip of the straw, with
which he drove away the flies. He delighted in
breaking the straw into small morsels, which he
did very dexterously with his trunk; and, as he
was daily led out to walk, he pulled and eat the
grass. The elephant which was lately at Naples,
though the heat is greater there than in France, lived
but a few years. Those which were sent to Pe∣tersburg,
though well sheltered, clothed, and
warmed with stoves, all died successively. Hence
we may conclude, that this animal is incapable
of subsisting, and far less can he multiply, in
any part of Europe. But I am astonished that
the Portuguese, who first knew the value and
utility of elephants in the East Indies, did not
transport them to the warm climate of Brasil,
where, by leaving them at liberty, they would
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
probably have multiplied. The elephants are
generally ash-coloured, or blackish. White ele∣phants,
as formerly remarked, are extremely
rare<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Some persons who lived long in Pondicherry, seem to doubt the existence of white and red elephants; for they af∣firm, that, in this part of India, at least, the elephants are all black. It is true, they remark, that, when these animals are long neglected to be washed, the dust which adheres to their oily and naked skin gives them the appearance of a dirty gray colour; but, when washed with water, they become as black as formerly. I believe that black is the natural colour of elephants, and none of any other colour are to be found in those parts of India which these people have had an oppor∣tunity of seeing. But, at the same time, it seems not to admit of a doubt, that, in Ceylon, Siam, Pegu, Cambaya, &amp;c. some white and red elephants are accidentally to be met with. For ocular witnesses of this fact, we might quote le Chevalier Chaumont, l'Abbè le Choisy, le P. Tachard, Vander Hagen, Joost Schuten, Thevenot, Ogilvy, and other travellers of less note. Hortenfels, who has collected, in his <HI>Elephantographia,</HI> a great number of facts from different voyages, assures us, that the white elephant has not only a white skin, but that the hair of its tail is also white. To these testimonies, we might add the authority of the antients. Aelian, lib. 3. cap. 46. mentions a small white elephant in India, and seems to insi∣nuate that the mother was black. This variety in the colour of elephants, though rare, is certain, and very antient. It has, perhaps, proceeded from their domestic condition, to which the Indians have been long accustomed to reduce these ani∣mals.</NOTE>; and authors are quoted who have seen
white and red elephants in different parts of In∣dia,
where they are highly valued<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">In the procession of the King of Pegu, two red elephants are led before, harnassed with silk and gold stuffs, which are followed by four white elephants, harnassed in a similar man∣ner, with the addition of precious stones, and the tusks cover∣ed with rubies; <HI>Voyage de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 3. p.</HI> 60.</NOTE>. Besides,
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
these varieties are so uncommon, that, instead of
considering them as distinct races, they ought to
be regarded as qualities purely individual and
accidental; for, if it were otherwise, we would
know the countries of white, red, and black ele∣phants,
in the same manner as we know the
climates of white, red, and black men. “In In∣dia,”
says P. Vincent Marie, “there are three
kinds of elephants, the white, which are the
largest, the most gentle, and peaceable, are
adored as gods by several nations: The red,
such as those of Ceylon, though the smallest in
size, are the most valorous, the strongest, and
the best for the purposes of war; the other e∣lephants,
whether from natural inclination, or
from recognising something superior, pay great
respect to those of Ceylon: The black is the
third kind, and they are the most common, and
in most estimation<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot"><HI>Voyage du P. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Vincent-Marie de St Catherine de Sienne, chap.</HI> 9. translated from the Italian by M. le Marquis de Montmirail.</NOTE>.” This is the only author
who seems to hint, that Ceylon is the peculiar
climate of red elephants; for other travellers
make no mention of such a fact. He likewise
asserts, that the Ceylon elephants are the smallest.
Thevenot says the same thing in his voyage,
p. 260. But other writers relate the reverse.
In fine, P. Vincent is the only author who says,
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
that the white elephants are the largest. P.
Tachard, on the contrary, assures us, that the
King of Siam's white elephant was diminutive,
though very old. After comparing the testimo∣nies
of travellers with regard to the magnitude
of elephants in different climates, to me it ap∣pears,
that the smallest are those of the west and
north of Africa, and that the antients, who knew
only the northern part of Africa, were right in
their general assertion, that the Indian elephants
were much larger than those of Africa. But, in
the eastern regions of this quarter of the world,
of which the antients were ignorant, the ele∣phants
are as large, and perhaps larger than
those of India. In this last region, it appears,
that the elephants of Siam, Pegu, &amp;c. are larger
than those of Ceylon; which, however, from the
unanimous testimony of travellers, have more
courage and intelligence.</P>
<P>Having thus marked the principal facts with
regard to the species, let us next examine, in
detail, the properties of the individual, his senses,
movements, size, strength, address, sagacity, &amp;c.
In proportion to the magnitude of his body,
the eyes of the elephant are very small; but
they are lively and brilliant: What distin∣guishes
them from the eyes of all other animals,
is a pathetic expression of sentiment, and an
almost rational management of all their actions<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Elephantographia Christophori Petri ab Hartenfels.</NOTE>.
He turns them slowly and with mildness towards
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
his master. When he speaks, the animal re∣gards
him with an eye of friendship and atten∣tion,
and his penetrating aspect is conspicuous
when he wants to anticipate the inclination of
his governour. He seems to reflect, to deli∣berate,
to think, and never determines till he
has several times examined, without passion or
precipitation, the signs which he ought to obey.
The dog, whose eyes are very expressive, is too
prompt and vivacious to allow us to distinguish
with ease the successive shades of his sensations.
But, as the elephant is naturally grave and mo∣derate,
we read in his eyes, whose movements
are slow, the order and succession of his inter∣nal
affections<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">The eyes of the elephant are, proportionally, exceed∣ingly small; but they are very active and lively, and they uniformly move in such a manner, as gives him the air of thought and reflection; <HI>Voyage au Indes Orientales du P. Fr. Vincent Marie de St Catherine de Sienne, p.</HI> 396.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His ear is very good; and the external organ
of hearing, like that of smelling, is more re∣markable
in the elephant than in any other ani∣mal.
His ears are very large, and much longer,
even in proportion to his body, than those of
the ass. They lie flat on the head, like the hu∣man
ears. They are commonly pendulous;
but he can raise and move them with such fa∣cility,
that he uses them to defend his eyes from
dust and flies<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The elephant has very large ears.... He perpetually moves them with much gravity, and they defend his eyes from all kinds of insects; <HI>Id. ibid......</HI> See also <HI>Les Memoires p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur servir à l'histoire des Animaux part. 3. p.</HI> 107.</NOTE>. He delights in the sound of
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
musical instruments, and moves in cadence to
the trumpet and tabour. His sense of smelling
is exquisite, and he is passionately fond of per∣fumes
of every kind, and especially of odorife∣rous
flowers, which he gathers one by one,
makes nosegays of them, and, after gratifying
his nose, conveys them to his mouth. The
flowers of the orange constitute one of his most
delicious morsels. With his trunk he robs an
orange tree of all its verdure, eating the fruit,
the flowers, the leaves, and even the small
branches<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Voyage de Guinèe, par Bosman, p. 243.</NOTE>. In the meadows, he selects the
most odoriferous plants; and, in the woods, he
prefers the cocoa, the banana, the palm, and the
sago trees; and, as these trees are soft and ten∣der,
he eats not only the leaves and fruit, but
even the branches, the trunk, and the roots;
for when they are unable to pull up the trees
with their trunk, they always succeed by using
their tusks.</P>
<P>With regard to the sense of touching, it is
chiefly confined to the trunk; but, in this mem∣ber,
it is as delicate and distinct as in the hu∣man
hand. The trunk is composed of mem∣branes,
nerves, and muscles; it is both an or∣gan
of feeling and of motion. The animal can∣not
only move and bend it, but he can contract,
lengthen, and turn it on all sides. The ex∣tremity
of the trunk terminates in a protube∣rance<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir a l'histoire des animaux, part. 3. p. 108. &amp; 140.</NOTE>
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
which stretches out on the upper side in
the form of a finger, by means of which the
elephant performs all that we do with our fin∣gers.
He lifts from the ground the smallest
piece of money; he selects the herbs and flowers,
and picks them up one by one; he unties the
knots of ropes, opens and shuts gates, by turning
the keys, or pushing back the bolts. He learns
to trace regular characters with an instrument
as small as a quill<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Mutianus ter Consul auctor est, aliquem ex his et litte∣rarum ductus Graecarum didicisse, solitumque praescribere ejus linguae verbis: Ipse ego haec scripsi, &amp;c.; <HI>Plin. Hist. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 3.—Ego verò ipse elephantum in tabula litteras Latinas promuscide atque ordine scribentem vidi: Verùmtamen docentis manus subjiciebatur ad litterarum duc∣tum et figuram eum instituens; dejectis autem et intentis o∣culis erat cum scriberet; doctos et litterarum gnaros animan∣tium oculos esse dixisses; <HI>Aelian, de nat. Anim. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 11,</NOTE>. It cannot be denied that
the elephant's hand has several advantages o∣ver
ours. It is equally flexible, and as dex∣terous
in touching or laying hold of objects.
These operations are performed by means of
the appendix or finger, situated on the superior
part of the border that surrounds the extremity
of the trunk, in the middle of which there is a
concavity in the form of a cup, and in the bottom
of the cup are the apertures of the two common
canals of smelling and of respiration. The ele∣phant,
therefore, has his nose in his hand, and
is enabled to combine the power of his lungs
with the action of his fingers, and to attract
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
fluids by a strong suction, or to raise heavy bo∣dies
by applying to them the edge of his trunk,
and making a vacuum within by a vigorous in∣spiration.</P>
<P>Hence delicacy of feeling, acuteness of smelling,
facility of movement, and the power of suction,
are united at the extremity of the elephant's nose.
Of all the instruments which Nature has so liberally
bestowed on her most favourite productions, the
trunk of the elephant is perhaps the most com∣plete
and the most admirable. It is not only
an organic instrument, but a triple sense, whose
united functions are at once the cause, and pro∣duce
the effects of that sagacity and those re∣markable
talents which distinguish the elephant,
and exalt him above all other quadrupeds. He is
not so subject, as other animals, to errors of
vision; because he quickly rectifies them by
the sense of touching; and, by using his trunk,
as a long arm, for the purpose of touching re∣mote
objects, he acquires, like man, clear ideas
of distances. But the other animals, excepting
the monkeys and others who have a kind of
arms and hands, cannot acquire ideas of distance
but by traversing space with their bodies. Of
all the senses, that of touching has the greatest
relation to intelligence. The delicacy of touch∣ing,
the flexibility of the trunk, the power of
suction, the sense of smelling, and the length
of the arm, give the ideas of the substance of
bodies, of their external form, of their weight,
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
of their salutary or noxious qualities, and of
their distance. Thus, by the same members,
and by one simultaneous act, the elephant feels,
perceives, and judges of several things at one
time. Now a multiplied sensation is equivalent,
in some measure, to reflection: Though this
animal, therefore, is, like all others, deprived of
the faculty of reflecting, as his sensations are
combined in the same organ, contemporary, and
not separated from each other, it is not surpri∣sing
that he should have ideas of his own, and
readily acquire those we wish to communicate to
him. The memory of the elephant should be
more perfect than that of any other animal; for
memory depends greatly on the circumstances
of actions. No solitary sensation, however lively,
can leave any distinct or durable impression;
but several combined and contemporary sensations
make deep and lasting impressions; so that, if
the elephant cannot recollect an idea by touch
alone, the adjacent and accessory sensations of
smelling, and the power of suction, which have
acted at the same time, aids him in recalling
the remembrance of it. In man, the best mode
of rendering the memory faithful, is to employ
successively all our senses in examining an ob∣ject;
and it is owing to the neglect of habi∣tuating
ourselves to the combined use of our
senses, that we forget most things we ought
to remember.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56"/>
But, though the elephant has more memo∣ry
and intelligence than any other animal, his
brain is proportionally smaller than that of most
quadrupeds<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir á l'hist. des animaux, part. 3. p. 135.</NOTE>. I mention this fact as a proof
that the brain is not the seat of sensation, the
<HI>sensorium commune,</HI> which, on the contrary, re∣sides
in the nerves of the senses, and in the mem∣branes
of the head. Thus the nerves distri∣buted
upon the trunk of the elephant, are so
numerous as to be equivalent to all those be∣stowed
on the rest of the body. It is, there∣fore,
by virtue of this singular combination of
senses and faculties in the trunk, that the ele∣phant
excells all other animals in sagacity, not∣withstanding
the enormity of his mass, and the
disproportion of his form; for the elephant is,
at the same time, a miracle of intelligence and
a monster of matter. The thickness and inflexi∣bility
of his body; the shortness and stiffness of
his neck; the smallness and deformity of his
head; the excessive largeness of his ears and
nose; the minuteness of his eyes, mouth, genitals,
and tail; his straight, clumsy, and almost in∣flexible
limbs; the shortness and smallness of
his feet<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The feet of every animal is proportionally larger than that of man, excepting the elephant, which is still smaller.—The feet were so small as to be hardly perceptible; because the toes are covered with the skin of the legs, which hangs down on all sides as far as the ground, and appears like the trunk of a tree cut across: <HI>Mem. pour servir à Phist. des animaux, p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>, which are hardly apparent; the thick∣ness
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
and callosity of his skin: All these de∣formities
are the more conspicuous and disagree∣able
to the eye, because they are modelled
on a large scale, and most of them peculiar
to the elephant alone; for in no animal are
the head, the feet, the nose, the ears, and the
tusks, situated like those of the elephant.</P>
<P>From this strange conformation, the animal is
subjected to several inconveniencies. He moves
his head with difficulty, and cannot turn him∣self,
in order to go back, without making a cir∣cuit.
The hunters who attack him behind, or
on the flanks, avoid the effects of his vengeance
by circular movements; and they have time to
renew their blows while he is turning himself
against them. His legs, the rigidity of which is
not so great as that of his neck and body, bend
but slowly, and with difficulty. They are strong∣ly
articulated to the thighs. His knee is like
that of man<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">His knee is situated, like that of man, in the middle between the belly and the foot; so that the elephant's leg is similar to a man's, both with regard to the position of the knee and the smallness of the foot, the extent of which, from the heel to the toes, is very small; <HI>Mem. pour servir a l'hist. des animaux, part. 3. p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>, and his foot is equally low; but
the latter has no extent, spring, or force, and the
former is hard and rigid. As long, however, as
the elephant is young and in health, he bends
his knees to lie down, and to allow himself to be
mounted, or charged with a load. But, when
old or sick, this movement becomes so laborious,
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
that he chooses rather to sleep on his feet; and,
if forced to lie down<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">We learned from the people who had the charge of the elephant at Versailles, formerly mentioned, that, the first eight years he lived, he lay down and rose with great facility; and that, during the last five years, he did not lie down to sleep, but leaned against the wall of his apartment; so that, if he had hap∣pened to lie down when sick, it would have been necessary to pierce the floor above, in order to raise him with engines; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, p.</HI> 104.</NOTE>, machines are necessary
to raise him. His tusks, which, with age, be∣come
enormously heavy, and not being placed,
like the horns of other animals, in a vertical po∣sition,
form two long levers, which, by their al∣most
horizontal direction, fatigue the head pro∣digiously,
and make it hang down; so that the
animal is sometimes obliged to make holes in the
wall of his lodge to support them, and relieve
him of their weight<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">We saw where the elephant had employed his tusks in ma∣king holes in a stone-pillar, which projected from the wall of his lodge, and these holes supported him when sleeping, his tusks being put into them; <HI>Id. p.</HI> 102.</NOTE>. He has the disadvantage
of having the organ of smelling very distant from
that of tasting, and the inconvenience of not be∣ing
able to seize any thing on the ground with
his mouth, because his neck is too stiff and too
short to allow his head to reach the earth. He
is, therefore, obliged to lay hold of his food,
and even of his drink, with his nose, and then
to convey it, not only to the entrance of his
mouth, but as far as the throat; and, when the
trunk is filled with water, he thrusts the end of
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
it to the very root of the tongue<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part 3. p. 109.</NOTE>, seemingly
with the intention of pushing back the epiglottis
to prevent the water, which rushes out with im∣petuosity,
from entering into the larynx; for he
forces out the water by the same air which he
employed to suck it up, and it rushes out of the
trunk with noise, and precipitantly enters the
gullet. The tongue, the mouth, and the lips,
are of no use to him, as in other animals, to suck
or lap his drink.</P>
<P>From this description, the singular consequence
results, that the young elephant must suck with
its nose, and afterwards convey the milk to its
gullet. We are told, however, by the antients,
that he sucks with his mouth, and not with his
trunk<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Pullus editus ore sugit, non promuscide, et statim cum na∣tus est cernit et ambulat; <HI>Arist. hist. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 27.—Anni∣culo qoidem vitulo aequalem pullum edit elephantus, qui statim, ut natus est, ore sugit; <HI>Aelian. de nat. anim. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE>. But there is reason to believe that they
never were witnesses of the fact, and that they
reasoned solely from the analogy of other animals.
If the young elephant ever acquired the habit of
sucking with his mouth, why should he lose it
during the rest of his life? Why does he never
employ the mouth to suck in water? Why does
he uniformly employ a double action, when a
single one would answer the purpose? Why does
he never seize any object with his mouth, ex∣cept
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
what is thrown into it when open<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Voyez les Memoires pour servir à l'hist. des Animaux, part, 3. p. 109. et 110.</NOTE>? It is,
therefore, extremely probable, that the young e∣lephant
sucks only with his trunk. This pre∣sumption
is not only proved by the following
facts, but is founded on a stronger analogy than
that which gave rise to the opinion of the an∣tients.
We formerly remarked, that, in general
animals, at the moment of birth, can perceive
the presence of the aliment they want by no o∣ther
sense but that of smelling. The ear can
have no effect; neither can the eye; for most
animals are blind when they begin to suck. The
sense of touching can only convey a vague and
indiscriminate notion of all the parts of the mo∣ther's
body, or, rather, it can indicate nothing
relative to appetite. But the sense of smelling
is alone sufficient for this purpose: It is not on∣ly
a species of taste, but a fore-taste, which pre∣cedes,
accompanies, and determines the other kind.
The elephant, therefore, like all other animals,
perceives, by this fore-taste, the presence of his ali∣ment:
And, as the seat of smelling is united with
the power of suction at the extremity of the trunk,
he applies it to the teat, sucks the milk, and con∣veys
it to the mouth to satisfy his appetite. Be∣sides,
the two paps, as in woman, are situated on
the breast, and, the teats being very small in pro∣portion
to the size of the young one's mouth,
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
whose neck also has little flexibility, the mother
must have lain on her back or side to enable her
young to lay hold of the teat with its mouth;
and, even in this situation, it would have been
difficult to extract the milk, on account of the
enormous disproportion between the largeness of
the mouth and the smallness of the teat. But
the margin of the trunk, which the animal con∣tracts
at pleasure, is easily accommodated to the
teat, and enables the young elephant to suck the
mother either when she stands or lies on her side.
Thus every circumstance concurs in invalidating
the notion of the antients on this subject; for
none of them, nor even any of the moderns, al∣ledge
that they ever saw the elephant sucking;
and I have no hesitation in predicting, that,
whenever such an observation is made, it will
appear, that he sucks not with his mouth, but
with his nose. I likewise imagine that the an∣tients
are deceived, when they tell us, that the
elephants copulate like other quadrupeds, the
female only lowering her crupper<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Subsidit foemina, clunibusque submissis, et insistit pedibus ac innititur; mas superveniens comprimit, atque ita munere vene∣reo fungitur; <HI>Arist. hist. anim, lib.</HI> 5. cap. 2.</NOTE>, for the more
easy reception of the male. The situation of the
parts seems to render this mode of junction im∣possible.
The female elephant has not, like o∣ther
quadrupeds, the orifice of the vagina adja∣cent
to the anus; for it is situated nearly in the
middle of the belly, about two and a half, or
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
three feet distant from the anus<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir à I'hist. des animaux, part▪ 3. p. 132.</NOTE>. On the other
hand, the male organ is by no means propor∣tioned
to the magnitude of his body, nor to so
long an interval, which, in the situation suppo∣sed,
would preclude the practicability of his ap∣proach.
Naturalists as well as travellers agree
in affirming, that the male organ of the elephant
exceeds not, either in length or diameter<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Elephantus genitale equo simile habet, sed parvum nec pro corporis magnitudine. Testes idem non <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oris conspicuos sed intus circa renes conditos habet; <HI>Arist. hist. anim. lib. 2. cap. 1.—L'Afrique d'Ogilby, p. l3. et</HI> 14.</NOTE>, that
of a horse. It is, therefore, impossible that he
should attain his end in the ordinary position of
quadrupeds. The female must necessarily lie on
her back. De Feynes<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">When these animals couple, the female lies on her back; and, after the operation, the male raises the female with his trunk; <HI>Voyage par terre à la Chine du S. de Feynes, p.</HI> 90.</NOTE> and Tavernier<NOTE N="‖" TYPE="foot">Though the elephants have no intercourse in a domestic slate; yet they frequently come in season. It is remarkable that the female, on these occasions, collects all kinds of herbs and leaves, of which she makes a bed elevated four or five feet above the ground, and, contrary to the nature of all other qua∣drupeds, lies down on her back, and solicits the male by her cries; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom.</HI> 3.p.240.</NOTE> posi∣tively

their evidence, that these animals cannot
intermix in any other manner<NOTE N="§" TYPE="foot">This article was written before I saw M. de Bussy's Notes concerning the elephant; and his evidence fully confirms the fact, which the situation of the parts had suggested.' “The ele∣phant,” says M. de Bussy, “copulate in a singular manner. 'The female lies down on her back. The male rests on his fore leg, bends down those behind, and touches not the female any farther than is necessary to effect his purpose.”</NOTE>. They require,
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
therefore, more time and conveniency for this
operation than other quadrupeds; and it is, per∣haps,
for this reason, that they never copulate
but when they enjoy full liberty, and have every
necessary article at their command. The female
must not only consent, but solicit the male by a
position which she never assumes, unless when
she thinks herself in perfect retirement<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Pudore nunquam nisi in abdito coeunt; <HI>Plin. hist. nat. lib.

we not, therefore, conclude, that modesty is a
physical virtue which exists in the brute creation?
It is, at least, like softness, moderation, and tem∣perance,
a general and beautiful attribute of the
female sex.</P>
<P>Thus the elephant neither sucks, generates,
eats, nor drinks like other animals. The sound
of his voice is likewise extremely singular. If
we believe the antients, the elephant utters two
kinds of cries, one by the trunk, which, from its
sinuosities and inflexions, is rough and long, like
the sound of a trumpet; and another by the
mouth, which is interrupted by short pauses and
harsh sighs<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Elephants citra nares ore ip so vocem edit spirabundam, quemadmodum cum homo simul et spiritum reddit et loquitur, at per nares simile tubarum raucitati sonat; <HI>Arist. hist. anim. lib.</HI> 4. cap. 9.—Citra nares ore ipso sternutamento similem edit sonum; per nares autem tubarum raucitati; <HI>Plin, hist. nat. lib</HI> 8.</NOTE>. This fact, which was advanced
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
by Aristotle, and afterwards repeated by natu∣ralists
and travellers, is probably false, or, at least,
not exactly related. M. de Bussy denies that the
elephant utters any cry through the trunk. How∣ever,
as a man, by shutting his mouth close, can
make a sound through his nose, the elephant,
whose nose is so large, may produce sounds in
the same manner. But, however this may be,
the cry of the elephant is heard at the distance
of more than a league, and yet it excites not
terror, like the roaring of the lion or tiger.</P>
<P>The elephant is still more singular in the
structure of his feet, and the texture of his skin,
which last is not, like other quadrupeds, covered
with hair, but totally bare, as if it were shaven.
There are only a few bristles in the fissures of
the skin, and these bristles are thinly scattered
over the body, but very numerous on the cilia
and back of the head<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Memoires pour servir à l'Histoire des animaux, part. 3, p. 113.</NOTE>, in the auditory passages,
and the insides of the thighs and legs. In the
epidermis, or scarf skin, there are two kinds of
wrinkles, the one raised and the other depressed,
which give it the appearance of being cut into
fissures, resembling pretty nearly the bark of an
old oak tree. In man and the other animals,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
the epidermis adheres throughout to the skin;
but, in the elephant, it is only attached by some
points of insertion, like two pieces of cloth
stitched together. This epidermis is naturally
dry, and very subject to grow thick. It often
acquires the thickness of three or four lines, by
the successive drying of different layers which are
produced one above another. It is this thicken∣ing
of the scarf skin which gives rise to the <HI>ele∣phantiasis</HI>
or <HI>dry leprosy,</HI> to which man, whose
skin is naked like that of the elephant, is some∣times
subject. This disease is very common to
the elephant; and the Indians, to prevent it,
rub him frequently with oil, and bathe him with
water, with a view to preserve the skin clean and
flexible. The skin, where it is not callous, is
extremely sensible. In the fissures, and other
places where it is neither dry nor hardened, the
elephant feels the stinging of flies in such a live∣ly
manner, that he not only employs his natu∣ral
movements, but even the resources of his in∣telligence,
to get rid of them. He strikes them
with his tail, his ears, and his trunk. He con∣tracts
his skin, and crushes them between its
wrinkles. He drives them off with branches of
trees, or handfuls of long straw. When all these
artifices are unsuccessful, he collects dust with
his trunk, and covers all the sensible parts of his
skin with it. He has been observed pulverizing
himself in this manner several times in a day;
and always at the most proper season, namely,
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
after bathing<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">I was informed that the elephant at Versailles always rolled in the dust after bathing, which he did as often as he was allowed; and it was observed, that he threw dust upon all the places which had been missed when he rolled himself, and that he drove off the flies with handfuls of straw, or by throwing dust with his trunk on the places where he felt himself stung, there being nothing which the flies avoid so much as falling dust; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part.</HI> 3. p. 117.</NOTE>. The use of water is as neces∣sary
to these animals as air. When free, they
never quit the banks of rivers, and often go into
the water till it reaches their belly, and in this
situation they daily spend several hours. In In∣dia,
where the elephants are treated in the man∣ner
that best corresponds with their nature and
temperament, they are carefully bathed, and al∣lowed
time and every possible conveniency for
bathing themselves<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">About eight or nine o'clock before noon, we went to the river to see the elephants belonging to the King and the Nobles bathed. The animal goes into the water till it reaches his belly, and, lying down on one side, fills his trunk several times, and throws the water upon the parts which are uncovered. The master then rubs off, with a kind of pumice stone, all the dirt that has been collected on the creature's skin. Some authors tell us, that, when the elephant lies down, he is unable to raise himself. But this assertion is not founded in truth; for the master, after rubbing one side, desires the animal to turn to the other, which he does very quickly; and, after both sides are well curried, he comes out of the river, and stands some time on the bank till he dries. The master then brings a pot of red or yellow paint, and draws lines on the elephant's face, round the eyes, upon the breast and rump. He is next rubbed over with oil to strengthen his nerves; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom.</HI> 3. p. 264.</NOTE>. Their skin is cleaned by
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
rubbing it with a pumice stone; and then they
are anointed with perfumed oils, and painted
with various colours.</P>
<P>The structure of the elephant's feet and legs
still differs from that of most other animals. The
fore legs appear to be longer than the hind legs,
and yet the former are somewhat shorter<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servlr à l'hist. des anim. part. 3. p. 102.</NOTE>. The
hind legs are not bended in two places like those
of the horse and ox, in whom the thigh-bone is
almost totally concealed in the buttock, the knee
is situated near the belly, and the bones of the
foot are so high and so long, that they appear to
constitute a great part of the leg. But the foot
of the elephant is very short, and rests on the
ground. His knee, like that of man, is placed
near the middle of the leg. The short foot of
the elephant is divided into five toes, which are
so covered with the skin as not to be visible.
We only see a kind of nails, the number of which
varies, though that of the toes remains always
the same. There are uniformly five toes on
each foot, and commonly five nails<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">The royal Academy of sciences recommended to me to examine whether all the elephants had nails on their feet. I never saw a single elephant which had not five on each foot at the extremities of the five large toes. But the toes are so short, that they hardly project from the foot; <HI>Premier voyage de P. Tachard, p.</HI> 273.</NOTE>; but some∣times
there are only four<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">All those who have written concerning the elephant, assign five nails to each foot; but, in our subject, there were only three. The small Indian elephant formerly mentioned had four nails both on the fore and hind feet. But there are uniformly five toes on each foot; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part.</HI> 3. p. 103.</NOTE>, or even three nails;
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
and, in this case, they correspond not exactly
with the extremities of the toes. Besides, this
variety, which has only been remarked in young
elephants brought to Europe, seems to be pure∣ly
accidental, and probably depends on the man∣ner
the animal has been treated during the first
years of its growth. The sole of the foot is co∣vered
with a kind of leather as hard as horn, and
projects outward all around. The nails consist
of the same substance.</P>
<P>The ears of the elephant are very long, move∣able
at pleasure, and serve the animal as a fan.
The tail is not longer than the ears, being gene∣rally
from two and a half to three feet in length.
It is thin, pointed, and garnished at the extremi∣ty
with a tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of thick hairs, or rather threads
of a black, glossy, solid, horny substance. This hair
or horn is as thick and strong as iron-wire, and a
man cannot break it by pulling it with his hands,
though it be flexible and elastic. In fine, this
tuft of hair is greatly esteemed as an ornament
by the Negro women, who are probably attach∣ed
to it by some superstition<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Merolla remarks, that many of the Pagans in these countries, and particularly the Saggas, have a devout regard for the elephant's tail. When any of their chiefs die, they preserve, in honour of him, one of these tails, to which they pay a kind of religious worship, founded on the notion of its power. They often go a hunting solely with a view to obtain a tail of this kind. But it must be cut off with a single blow from the live animal, without which, superstition ascribes to it no virtue; Hist gen. des Voyages, par l'Abbé Prevost, tom. s. p. 79.</NOTE>. An elephant's
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
tail is sometimes sold for two or three slaves;
and the Negroes often hazard their lives in en∣deavouring
to cut it off from the live animal.
Beside this tuft, the tail is covered, or rather
strewed, through its whole extent, with bristles
as large and as hard as those of the wild boar.
These bristles are also found on the convex part
of the trunk and the eye-brows, where they
sometimes exceed a foot in length. Bristles or
hairs on the eye-lids are peculiar to man, the
monkey, and the elephant.</P>
<P>Climate, food, and situation, have a great in∣fluence
on the growth and size of the elephant.
In general, such as are taken young, and reduced
to captivity, never acquire their natural dimen∣sions.
The largest elephants of India and the
eastern parts of Africa are fourteen feet high;
the smallest, which are found in Senegal, and o∣ther
western regions of Africa, exceed not ten or
eleven feet; and those which are brought young
to Europe never arrive at this height. The Ver∣failles
elephant, which came from Congo<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 3. p. 101.</NOTE>, at
the age of seven years, was not above seven and
a half feet high. During the thirteen years that
he lived, he acquired only one foot; so that, at
the age of four, when he was transported, he was
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
only six and a half feet in height; and, as the
rate of growth always diminishes as animals ad∣vance
in years, it cannot be supposed, that, if he
had lived thirty years, the common period when
the growth of elephants is completed, he would
have acquired more than eight feet in height.
Hence the domestic state reduces the growth of
the elephant one third, not only in height, but
in all other dimensions. The length of his body,
from the eye to the origin of the tail, is nearly
equal to his height at the withers. An Indian
elephant, therefore, of fourteen feet high, is more
than seven times larger and heavier than the
Versailles elephant. By comparing the growth
of this animal to that of man, we will find, that
an infant, being commonly thirty-one inches
high, that is, one half of its height, at the age of
two years, and taking its full growth at twenty
years, the elephant, which grows till thirty, ought
to acquire the half of his height in three years.
In the same manner, if we would form a judg∣ment
of the enormous mass of the elephant, we
will find, that, the volume of a man's body being
supposed to be two cubic feet and a half, the
body of an elephant of fourteen feet long, three
feet thick, and a proportional breadth, would be
fifty times as large; and, consequently, that an
elephant ought to weigh as much as fifty men<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Peirère, in his life of Gassendi, says, that an elephant which he caused to be weighed, was three thousand five hun∣dred pounds. This elephant seems to have been very small; for, according to the calculation I have made in the text, the dimensions of which I rather under-rated, would have weighed at least eight thousand pounds.</NOTE>.

“I saw,” says le P. Vincent Marie, “some ele∣phants
which were fourteen and fifteen<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">These are probably Roman feet.</NOTE> feet
high, with a proportional length and thickness.
The male is always larger than the female.
The price of these animals augments in propor∣tion
to their size, which is measured from the
eye to the extremity of the back, and, after ex∣ceding
certain dimensions, the price rises like
that of precious stones<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">Voyage aux indes Orientales du P. Vincent Marie, chap. 11. P. 396.</NOTE>.” “The Guiney ele∣phants,”
Bosman remarks, “are ten, twelve, or
thirteen feet high<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">These are probably Rhenish feet.</NOTE>; and yet they are incom∣parably
smaller than those of the East Indies;
for the historians of that country give more
cubits to the height of the latter than the for∣mer
has feet<NOTE N="§" TYPE="foot">Voyage en Guinée de Guillanme Bosman, P. 244.</NOTE>.” “I saw,” says Edward Terry,
“elephants of thirteen feet in height, and many
people affirmed, that they had seen elephants
fifteen feet high<NOTE N="‖" TYPE="foot">Voyage to the East ladies by Edward Terry. <HI>Note.</HI> These are perhaps English feet.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>From these, and many other testimonies which
might be enumerated, we may conclude, that the
ordinary stature of the elephant is from ten to
eleven feet; that those of thirteen and fourteen
are very rare; and that the smallest, when they
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
acquire their full growth in a state of liberty, are
at least nine feet. These enormous masses of
matter fail not, however, as formerly remarked,
to move with great quickness. They are sup∣ported
by four members, which, instead of
legs, resemble massy columns of fifteen or eigh∣teen
inches diameter, and from five to six feet
high. These legs, therefore, are twice as long
as those of man. Hence, though the elephant
should make but one step, while a man makes
two, it would outstrip him in the chace. The
ordinary walk of the elephant is not quicker
than that of a horse<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bussy, communicated by the Marquis de Montmirail.</NOTE>; but, when pushed, he as∣sumes
a kind of amble, which, in fleetness, is e∣quivalent
to a gallop. He performs with prompt∣ness,
and even with freedom, all direct move∣ments;
but he wants facility in oblique or
retrograde motions. It is generally in narrow and
hollow places, where the elephant can hardly turn,
that the Negroes attack him, and cut off his tail,
which they value above all the rest of the body.
He has great difficulty in descending steep decli∣vities,
and is obliged to fold his hind legs<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bussy.</NOTE>, that,
in going down, the anterior part of his body
may be on a level with the posterior, and to
prevent being precipitated by his own weight.
He swims well, though the form of his legs and
feet seem to indicate the contrary. But, as the
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
capacity of his breast and belly is large, as the
size of his lungs and intestines is enormous, and
as all the great parts of his body are filled with
air, or matters lighter than water, he sinks not so
deep as other animals. He has, therefore, less
resistence to overcome, and, consequently, is ena∣bled
to swim more quickly with smaller efforts
of his limbs. Of course, he is of great use in
the passage of rivers. When employed on these
occasions<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bussy.</NOTE>, beside two pieces of cannon which
admit three or four pound balls, he is loaded
with great quantities of baggage, independent
of a number of men fixed to his ears and his
tail. When thus loaded, he enters the river, and
swims so much below the water that no part of
his body is seen except his trunk, which he
raises in the air for the benefit of respiration.</P>
<P>Though the elephant generally feeds on herbs
and tender wood, and though prodigious quan∣tities
of this aliment are necessary to afford a
sufficient number of organic particles to nourish
so vast a body, he has not several stomachs, like
most animals who live on the same substances.
He has but one stomach, does not ruminate, and
is formed rather like the horse than the ox and
other ruminating animals. The want of a
paunch is supplied by the largeness and length
of his intestines, and particularly of the colon,
which is two or three feet in diameter by fifteen
or twenty in length. The stomach is much
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
smaller than the colon, being only three and a
half or four feet long, and only one or one and
a half in its largest diameter. To fill such ca∣pacious
vessels, it is necessary that the animal,
when not furnished with nourishment more sub∣stantial
than herbage, should eat almost perpe∣tually.
Wild elephants, accordingly, are almost
continually employed tearing up trees, gather∣ing
leaves, and breaking young wood; and the
domestic elephants, though supplied with great
quantities of rice, fail not to collect herbs when∣ever
they have an opportunity. However great
the appetite of the elephant, he eats with mode∣ration,
and his taste for cleanliness is superior to
the calls of hunger. His address in separating
with his trunk the good leaves from the bad,
and the care which he takes in shaking them till
they are perfectly clear of insects and fand, af∣ford
great pleasure to the spectator<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Notes of M. de Bussy.</NOTE>. He is
fond of wine, aquavitae, arrack, &amp;c. By show∣ing
him a vessel filled with any of these liquors,
and promising him it as the reward of his la∣bours,
he is induced to exert the greatest efforts,
and to perform the most painful tasks. He
seems to love the smoke of tobacco; but it stu∣pifies
and intoxicates him. He abhors all bad
smells; and has such a terror at the hog, that
the cry of that animal makes him fly<NOTE N="‡" TYPE="foot">The Versailles elephant had such a terror and aversion at swine, that the cry of a young hog made him fly to a great distance. This antipathy has been remarked by Aelian.</NOTE>.

To complete the idea of the nature and in∣telligence
of this singular animal, I shall here
add some notes communicated to me by the
Marquis de Montmirail, president of the royal
academy of sciences, who has been so obliging
as not only to collect, but to translate every
thing regarding quadrupeds from some Italian
and German books with which I am unac∣quainted.
His zeal for the advancement of
knowledge, his exquisite discernment, and his
extensive knowledge in natural history, entitle
him to the highest marks of distinction; and
the reader will find how often I shall have oc∣casion
to quote him in the subsequent parts of
this work. “The elephant is used in dragging
artillery over mountains; and it is on such
occasions that his sagacity is most conspicuous.
When the oxen, yoked to a cannon, make an
effort to pull it up a declivity, the elephant
pushes the breach with his front, and, at each
effort, he supports the carriage with his knee,
which he places against the wheel. He seems
to understand what is said to him. When his
conductor wants him to execute any painful
labour, he explains the nature of the opera∣tion,
and recites the reasons which ought to
induce him to obey. If the elephant shows a
repugnance to what is exacted of him, the
<HI>Cornack,</HI> which is the name of the conductor,
promises to give him arrack, or some other
thing that he likes. But it is extremely dan∣gerous
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
to break any promise that is made to
him: Many cornacks have fallen victims to in∣discretions
of this kind. On this subject, a fact,
which happened at Dekan, deserves to be rela∣ted,
and, though it has the appearance of in∣credibility,
is, notwithstanding, exactly true.
An elephant, out of revenge, killed his cornack.
The man's wife, who beheld the dreadful
scene, took her two infants and threw them at
the feet of the enraged animal, saying, <HI>Since
you have slain my husband, take my life also, as
well as that of my children.</HI> The elephant in∣stantly
stopped, relented, and, as if stung with
remorse, took the eldest boy in its trunk,
placed him on its neck, adopted him for its
cornack, and would never allow any other per∣son
to mount it.”</P>
<P>“If the elephant is vindictive, he is not un∣grateful.
A soldier at Pondicherry was accu∣stomed
to give a certain quantity of arrack to
one of these animals every time he got his pay;
and, having one day intoxicated himself, and,
being pursued by the guard, who wanted to
put him in prison, he took refuge under the
elephant, and fell fast asleep. The guard in
vain attempted to drag him from this assylum;
for the elephant defended him with its trunk.
Next day, the soldier having recovered from
his drunkenness, was in dreadful apprehensions
when he found himself under the belly of an
animal so enormous. The elephant, which
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
unquestionably perceived his terror, caressed
him with its trunk.”</P>
<P>“The elephant is sometimes seized with a
kind of madness, which deprives him of all
tractability, and renders him so formidable,
that it is often necessary to kill him. The
people try to bind him with large iron
chains, in the hope of reclaiming him.
But, when in his ordinary state, the most a∣cute
pains will not provoke him to hurt those
who have never injured him. An elephant,
rendered furious by the wounds it had received
at the battle of Hambour, ran about the field
making the most hideous cries. A soldier,
notwithstanding the alarms of his comrades,
was unable, perhaps on account of his wounds,
to fly. The elephant approached, seemed a∣fraid
of trampling him under its feet, took him
up with its trunk, placed him gently on his
side, and continued its route.”</P>
<P>These notes I have transcribed verbatim.
They were communicated to the Marquis de
Montmirail by M. de Bussy, who resided ten
years in India, and performed many important
services to the state. He had several elephants
under his own charge, often rode upon them,
and had daily opportunities of observing many
others, which belonged to his neighbours. Hence
these notes, as well as all the others quoted un∣der
the name of M. de Bussy, merit every de∣gree
of credit. The members of the Royal
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
Academy of Sciences have also left us some facts,
which they learned from those who had the
management of the elephant at Versailles, and
which deserve a place in this work. “The ele∣phant
seemed to know when it was mocked
by any person; and remembered the affront
till an opportunity of revenge occurred. A
man deceived it, by pretending to throw some∣thing
into its mouth: The animal gave him
such a blow with its trunk as knocked him
down, and broke two of his ribs. After which,
it trampled on him with its feet, broke one of
his leg, and, bending down on its knees, en∣deavoured
to push its tusks into his belly; but
they luckily run into the ground on each side
of his thigh, without doing him any injury.
A painter wanted to draw the animal in an
unusual attitude, with its trunk elevated, and
its mouth open. The painter's servant, to
make it remain in this position, threw fruits
into its mouth, but generally made only a
faint of throwing them. The elephant was
enraged, and, as if it knew that the painter
was the cause of this teazing impertinence, in∣stead
of attacking the servant, it eyed the
master, and squirted at him such a quantity of
water from its trunk as spoiled the paper on
which he was drawing.”</P>
<P>“This elephant generally made less use of its
strength than its address. With great ease
and coolness, it loosed the buckle of a large
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
double leathern strap, with which its leg was
fixed; and, as the domestics had wrapped the
buckle round with a small cord, and tied many
knots on it, the creature deliberately loosed
the whole, without breaking either the cord or
the strap. One night, after disengaging itself
in this manner from its strap, it broke up the
door of its lodge with such dexterity as not to
waken the keeper. From thence it went into
several courts of the menagery, forcing open
doors, and throwing down the walls when the
doors were too narrow to let it pass. In this
manner it got access to the apartments of o∣ther
animals, and so terrified them, that they
fled into the most retired corners of the encl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sure.”</P>
<P>In fine, that nothing may be omitted which
can contribute to throw light upon the natural
and acquired faculties of an animal so superior
to all others, we shall add some facts, extracted
from the most respectable and unsuspicious tra∣vellers.</P>
<P>“Even the wild elephant,” says le P. Vincent
Marie, “has his virtues. He is generous and▪
temperate; and, when rendered domestic, he
is esteemed for gentleness and fidelity to his
master, friendship to his governour, &amp;c. If
destined to the immediate service of Princes,
he recognises his good fortune, and maintains
a gravity of demeanour corresponding to the
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
dignity of his office. If, on the contrary, less
honourable labours are assigned to him, he
turns melancholy, frets, and evidently disco∣vers
that he is humbled and depressed. In
war, during the first onset, he is fiery and
impetuous. When surrounded with hunters,
he is equally brave. But, after being van∣quished,
he loses all courage. He fights with
his tusks, and dreads nothing so much as to
lose his trunk, which, from its consistence, is
easily cut........ I shall only add, that the
elephant is mild, attacks no person without
being injured, seems to love society, is parti∣cularly
fond of children, whom he caresses,
and appears to discern the innocence of their
manners.”</P>
<P>“The elephant,” says Pyrard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de François Pyrard, tom. 2. p. 366.</NOTE>, “is an animal
of so much knowledge and judgment, that,
beside his infinite utility to man, he may be
said to enjoy a certain portion of reason. When
about to be ridden, he is so obedient and well
trained, that he accommodates his behaviour
to the quality of the person he serves. He
bends down, and assists his master to mount
with his trunk....... He is so tractable, that
he will perform any thing that is required of
him, provided he be treated with, gentleness...

“By giving elephants,” say the Dutch voya∣gers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 1. p. 413.</NOTE>,
“whatever is agreeable to them, they
are soon rendered as tame and submissive as
men. They may be said to be deprived only
of the use of language...... They are proud
and ambitious; but they are so grateful for be∣nefits
received, that, as a mark of respect, they
bow their heads in passing the houses where
they have been hospitably received..... They
allow themselves to be led and commanded by
a child<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem, tom. 7. p. 31.</NOTE>;
but they love to be praised and ca∣ressed.
They quickly feel an injury or an af∣front;
and the guilty person should be on his

they content themselves with squirting water
upon him with their trunks, or simply throw∣ing
him into a mire.”</P>
<P>“The elephant,” P. Philippe remarks<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Orient. du P, Philippe de la Très-Sainte-Trinité, p. 366.</NOTE>, “makes
a near approach to the judgment and reasoning
of man. When compared with the apes, they
appear to be stupid and brutal animals. The
elephants are so extremely modest, that they
will not copulate in the presence of any per∣son;
and, if by accident, any man perceives
this operation, they infallibly resent it, &amp;c....
Their salute is performed by bending the
knees, and lowering the head; and, when their
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
master wants to mount them, they assist him
with great dexterity. When a wild elephant
is taken, the hunters tie his feet, and one ac∣costs
and salutes him, makes apologies for
binding him, protests that no injury is meant,
tells him, that, in his former condition, he of∣ten
wanted food, but that, henceforward, he
shall be well treated, and that every promise
shall be performed to him, &amp;c. The hunter
no sooner finishes this soothing harangue, than
the elephant follows him like a tamed lamb.
We must not, however, conclude from hence,
that the elephant understands language, but
only, that, having a very strong discerning
faculty, he distinguishes esteem from contempt,
friendship from hatred, and all the other emo∣tions
which men exhibit to him; and for this
reason he is more easily tamed by arguments
than by blows......... With his trunk he
throws stones very far, and very straight, and
also uses it for pouring water on his body when
bathing.”</P>
<P>“Of five elephants,” Tavernier remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 3. p. 238.</NOTE>,
“which the hunters had taken, three escaped,
though ropes and chains were thrown round
their bodies and limbs. The natives told us
the following most astonishing story, if it could
be credited. When an elephant, they said,
has once been caught in a pitfall, and escapes
from the snare, he becomes extremely diffi∣dent,
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
breaks off a large branch with his trunk,
and strikes the ground every where before he
sets down his feet, in order to discover by the
sound whether there are any concealed holes
by which he may be entrapped a second time.
For this reason, the hunters who related this
story despaired of being able, without much
difficulty, to retake the three elephants which
had made their escape....... Each of the
two elephants which had been seized were
placed between two tames ones, and surround∣ed
by six men with burning torches, who
spoke to the animals, and, presenting food to
them, said, in their language, <HI>take this and eat
it.</HI> The food consisted of small bunches of
hay, pieces of black sugar, and boiled rice
mixed with pepper. When the wild elephant
refused to do what he was ordered, the men
ordered the tame elephants to beat him, which
they performed, the one striking him on the
front and head, and, if the captive animal at∣tempted
to defend himself, the other struck
him on the side; so that the poor creature knew
not where he was, and soon found himself o∣bliged
to obey.”</P>
<P>“I have frequently remarked,” says Edward
Terry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage to the East Indies by Edward Terry, p. 15.</NOTE>, “that the elephant performs many ac∣tions
which seem to proceed more from rea∣son
than from instinct. He does every thing
that his master commands: If he wants to ter∣rify
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
any person, he runs upon him with every
appearance of fury, and, when he comes near,
stops short, without doing him the smallest
injury. When the master chooses to affront
any man, he tells the elephant, who collects
water and mud with his trunk, and squirts it
upon the object pointed out to him. The
trunk is composed of cartilage, hangs between
the tusks, and is by some called his <HI>hand,</HI> be∣cause,
on many occasions, it answers the same
purposes as the human hand.... The Mogul
keeps some elephants who serve as execution∣ers
to criminals condemned to death. When
the conductor orders one of these animals to
despatch the poor criminals quickly, he tears
them to pieces in a moment with his feet.
But, if desired to torment them slowly, he
breaks their bones one after another, and
makes them suffer a punishment as cruel as
that of the wheel.”</P>
<P>We might quote many other facts equally
curious and interesting. But we would soon
exceed the limits we have prescribed to ourselves
in this work. We would not even have given
so lo long a detail, if the elephant had not been,
in many respects, the chief animal in the brute
creation, and who, of course, merited the great∣est
attention.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton has made several useful re∣marks
on the nature and qualities of ivory, and
has restored to the elephant those prodigious
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
tusks and bones which have been attributed to
the Mammouth. I acknowledge, that I was long
doubtful with regard to this point. I had often
compared these enormous bones with the skele∣ton
of nearly a full grown elephant preserved
in the Royal Cabinet: And as, before composing
their history, I could not persuade myself that
there existed elephants six or seven times larger
than the one whose skeleton I had so often ex∣amined,
and, as the large bones had not the
same proportions with the corresponding bones
of the elephant, I believed, with the generality
of naturalists, that these huge bones belonged to
a much larger animal, the species of which had
been lost or annihilated. But it is certain, from
the facts formerly mentioned, that there are ele∣phants
fourteen feet high, and, consequently,
(as the masses are as the cubes of the height), six
or seven times larger than that whose skeleton
is in the Royal Cabinet, and which was not a∣bove
seven, or seven and a half feet high. It is
likewise certain, that age changes the propor∣tions
of bones, and that adult animals grow con∣siderably
thicker, though their stature does not
increase. In fine, it is certain, from the testimo∣nies
of travellers, that there are elephants tusks,
each of which weighs more than a hundred and
twenty pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Eden informs us, that he measured several elephants tusks, which he found to be nine feet long; that others were as thick as a man's thigh; and that some of them weighed ninety pounds. It is said, that, in Africa, some tusks have been found, each of which weighed a hundred and twenty-five pounds..... The English voyagers brought from Guiney the head of an elephant, which Mr Eden saw in the possession of Mr Judde: It was so large, that the bones and cranium alone, without including the tusks, weighed about two hundred pounds; from which it was computed, that the whole parts of the head, taken in their entire state, would have weighed five hundred pounds; <HI>Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 1. p.</HI> 223.—Lopes amused himself in weighing several tusks of the elephant, each of which amounted to about two hundred pounds; <HI>Idem, tom. 5. p.</HI> 79.—The magnitude of elephants may be estimated by their tusks, some of which have been found to weigh two hundred pounds; <HI>Drake's voyage, p.</HI> 104.—In the kingdom of Loango, I purchased two tusks, which belonged to the same animal, and each of them weighed a hundred and twenty-six pounds; <HI>Voyage de la Com∣pagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 4. p.</HI> 319.—At the Cape of Good Hope, the elephants teeth are very large, and weigh from sixty to a hundred pounds; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne∣esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 12.</NOTE>. From all these facts, it is ap∣parent,
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
parent, that the prodigious bones and tusks a∣bove
taken notice of, are really the tusks and
bones of the elephant. Sir Hans Sloane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist, de l'Acad. des Sciences, année 1727, p. 1.</NOTE> says
the same thing; but brings no proof of the fact.
M. Gmelin affirms it still more positively<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In Siberia, there are prodigious quantities of bones found in different places under the ground. This part of natural history is both curious and important: I have therefore col∣lected all the facts I could learn upon this subject. Peter the Great, who was a patron of naturalists, gave orders to his subjects, in the year 1722, that, wherever any bones of the mammouth were discovered, the other bones belonging to the animal should be diligently sought for, and the whole sent to Petersburg. These orders were published in all the towns of Siberia, and, among others, in Jakutzk, where, after this pu∣blication, a Sluschewoi, called <HI>Wasilei Otlasow,</HI> entered into a writ∣ten obligation before Michaele Petrowitsch Ismailow, captain∣lieutenant of the guard, and Woywode of the place, to travel into the inferior cantons of Lena, in order to search for the bones of the mammouth; and he was despatched thither on the 23d of April the same year. The following year, another ad∣dressed the Chancery of Jakutzk, and represented, that he had travelled along with his son toward the sea, in quest of the bones of the mammouth, and that, opposite to Surjatoi Noss, about two hundred versts from that place and the sea, he found, in a turfy soil, which is common in these districts, the head of a mammouth with one of the horns adhering to it; and in the neighbourhood there was another horn of the same animal, which had probably fallen off while the creature was alive; that, at a little distance, they drew out of the earth another head, with the horns, of an unknown animal; that this head resembled that of an ox, only it had horns above its nose; that, on account of an accident which befel his eyes, he was obliged to leave these heads where they were; and that, having heard of his Majesty's orders, he now begged to be sent off with his son toward Vst-janskoje, Simowie, and the sea. His demand was complied with, and they were instantly despatched. A third Sluschewoi of Jakutzk represented to the chancery, in 1724, that he made a voyage on the river Jelon; that he was happy enough to discover, in a sleep bank of this river, a fresh head of the mammouth, with the horn and all its parts; that he drew it out of the earth, and left it where he could find it again; and that he begged to be sent off with two men ac∣customed to such researches. The woywode accordingly con∣sented. The Cossack soon after set out on his journey, and found the head and all its parts, excepting the horns; for there remained only the half of one horn, which he brought, along with the head, to the chancery of Jakutzk. Some time after, he brought two horns of the mammouth, which he also found on the river Jelon.</P>
<P>The Cossacks of Jakutzk were extremely happy to find, un∣der the pretext of going in quest of the bones of the mammouth, an opportunity of making such agreeable voyages. They were furnished with five or six post horses, while one would have been sufficient, and they could employ the rest in carrying various articles of merchandize. Such an advantage was a great en∣couragement to adventurers...... A Cossack of Jakutzk, called <HI>Jwanseisku,</HI> petitioned the chancery to be sent to the Simowies of Alaseisch and Kowymisch, in quest of these kind of bones, and of true crystal. He had already sojourned in these places, had collected many curious objects, and actually sent to Jakutzk some of these bones. Nothing seemed more important than this expedition; and the Cossack was despatch∣ed on the 21st day of April 1725.</P>
<P>Nasar-Koleschow, commissary of Indigirsk, in the year 1723, sent to Jakutzk, and from that to Irkurtzk, the bones of a sin∣gular head, which, according to my information, was two arschines, bating three werschok, in length, one arschine high, and armed with two horns and a tusk of the mammouth. This head arived at Irkutzk on the 14th day of October 1723; and I found the history of it in the chancery of that town. I was also assured, that the same man afterwards sent a horn of the mammouth.</P>
<P>These facts, collected from different sources, regard, in ge∣neral, the same species of bones, namely, 1. All the bones in the Imperial cabinet of Petersburg, under the name of <HI>Mammouth bones, will be sound, upon examination, to have a perfect re∣semblance to those of the elephant.</HI> 2. From what has been above related, it appears, that there have been found in the earth, heads of an animal totally different from an elephant, and which, particularly in the figure of the horns, resembled the head of an ox more than that of an elephant. Besides, this animal could not be so large as an elephant; and I have seen a head of it at Jakutzk, which had been sent from Anadir∣skoi-Ostrog, and was, according to my information, perfectly similar to that found by Portn-jagin. I myself had one from Ilainskoi-Ostrog, which I sent to the Imperial cabinet at Pe∣tersburg. In fine, I learned, that, on the banks of Nischnaja-Tunguska, similar heads are not only found every where disper∣sed, but likewise other bones which unquestionably belong not to the elephant, such as shoulder bones, ossa sacra, ossa innominata, hip-bones, and leg-bones, which probably pertained to the same animal to which the above head ought to be attributed, and which should by no means be excluded from the ox kind. I have seen leg and hip-bones of this species, concerning which I have nothing particular to remark, except that they ap∣peared to be extremely short in proportion to their thickness. Thus, in Siberia, two kinds of bones are found in the earth, of which none were formerly esteemed, but those which perfectly resembled the tusks of the elephant. But, after the Im∣perial order, the whole began to be examined; and, as the first gave rise to the fable of the mammouth, the last have also been indiscriminately ranked under the same class. Nei∣ther must we believe, with Isbrand-Ides, and the followers of his reveries, that it is only in the mountains which extend from the river Ket to the North-east, and, consequently, likewise in the environs of Mangasca and Jakutzk, where the elephants bones are to be found: For they appear not only through all Siberia, not excepting its most southern districts, as in the supe∣rior cantons of the Irtisch, Toms, and Lena, but are dispersed in different parts of Russia, and even in many places of Ger∣many, where they are called, with much propriety, by the name of <HI>fossil Ivory;</HI> for they have a perfect resemblance to e∣lephants teeth, except that they are in a corrupted state. In temperate climates, these teeth are softened and converted into fossil ivory; but, in countries frequently frozen, they are generally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cund very fresh. From this circumstance, the fable, that those and other bones are often found besmeared with blood▪ might easily arise. This fable has been gravely related by Isbrand-Ides, and, after him, by Muller, (Moeurs et usages des Ostiaques, dans <HI>le Recueil des Voyages a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nord, p.</HI> 382.) who have been copied by others with equal confidence as if there had been no room for doubt: And, as one fiction begets an∣other, the blood pretended to be found on those bones has produced the notion, that the mammouth is an animal which lives in Siberia under the ground, where it sometimes dies, and is buried under the rubbish. All this has been in∣vented with the view to account for the blood pretended to be found on these bones. Muller gives a description of the mam∣mouth. This animal, says he, is four or five yards high, and about thirty feet long. His colour is grayish; his head is very long, and his front very broad. On each side, precisely under the eyes, there are two horns, which he can move and cross at pleasure. In walking, he has the power of extending and contracting his body to a great degree. His paws, in thick∣ness, resemble those of the bear. Isbrandes-Ides is candid enough to acknowledge, that he never knew any person who had seen the mammouth alive........ The heads and other bones, which correspond with those of the elephant, un∣questionably once constituted real parts of that animal. To this abundance of elephants bones we cannot refuse our as∣sent; and I persume, that the elephants, to avoid destruction in the great revolutions which have happened in the earth, have been driven from their native country, and dispersed themselves wherever they could find safety. Their lot has been different. Some longer, and others shorter after their death, have been transported to great distances by some vast in∣undation. Those, on the contrary, who survived, and wan∣dered far to the North, must necessarily have fallen victims to the rigours of the climate. Others, without reaching so great a distance, might be drowned, or perish with fatigue..... The largeness of those bones ought not to astonish us. The tusks are sometimes four arschines long, and six inches in diame∣ter, (M. de Strahlenberg says they have been seen nine inches in diameter,) and the largest weigh from six to seven puds, I mentioned, in another place, that fresh tusks have been taken from the elephant, which were ten feet long, and weighed a hundred, a hundred and forty-six, a hundred and sixty, and a hundred and sixty-eight pounds...... There are pieces of fossil ivory which are yellowish, or grow yellow in the course of time; others are brown like coccoa nuts, and more lustrous: and others of a blackish blue colour. The tusks which have not been much affected with the frost in the earth, and have remained some time exposed to the air, are subject to become more or less yellow or brown, and assume other colours, according to the species of humidity with which the air is impregnated. M. de Strahlenberg also remarks, that pieces of these corrupted teeth are sometimes of a bluish black colour...... For the interest of natural history, it were to be wished, that, with regard to the other bones found in Siberia, we knew the animal to which they belong; but there is little hope of accomplishing this purpose; <HI>Relation d'un voyage a Kamtschatka, bar M.

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>From comparing the male and female ele∣phants,
the former of which we saw in the year
1771, and the latter in 1773, it appears, that, in
general, the parts of the female are grosser and
more fleshy. Her ears, indeed, are proportion∣ally
smaller than those of the male: But her
body is more swollen, her head larger, and her
members more rounded.</P>
<P>Like all other animals, the female elephant is
more gentle than the male. Our female-even
caressed people with whom she was unacquaint∣ed.
But the male is often formidable: The one
we saw in 1771 was fiercer, less affectionate, and
<PB N="89" REF="102"/>
more ungovernable than this female. In a state
of repose, the genitals of the male appear not ex∣ternally:
His belly seems to be perfectly smooth;
and it is only at the time of discharging urine,
that the extremity of the penis comes out of the
sheath. This male elephant, though equally
young with the female, was, as formerly remar∣ked,
more difficult to manage. He endeavoured
to lay hold of people who approached too near,
and often tore their clothes. Even his governours
were obliged to act with caution; but the female
obeyed with complacence and alacrity. The on∣ly
time she exhibited marks of displeasure was
when her keepers forced her into a covered wag∣gon,
in order to be carried from one town to an∣other.
When they wanted her to enter, she
refused to advance, and they could only accom∣plish
their purpose by pricking her behind. Ir∣ritated
by this ill treatment, and being unable to
turn herself in her prison, she had no other me∣thod
of revenge but to fill her trunk with water,
and throw it in torrents upon those who had
teazed her.</P>
<P>I remarked, in the history of the elephant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 59.</NOTE>,
that these animals probably did not copulate in
the manner of other quadrupeds; because the
position of the organs in both sexes seemed to
require that the female, in order to receive the
male, should lie on her back. This conjecture
which appeared to be plausible, is not true; for
<PB N="90" REF="103"/>
the following testimony of M. Marcel Bles, an
eye-witness, deserves full credit.</P>
<P>“Having perceived that the Count de Buffon,
in his excellent work, is deceived with regard
to the copulation of the elephants, I know, that,
in several parts of Asia and Africa, these ani∣mals,
especially during the season of love, re∣main
always in the most inaccessible places of
the forests; but, in the island of Ceylon, where
I lived twelve years, the land being every where
inhabited, they cannot so easily conceal them∣selves;
and, having often examined them, I
perceived that the female organ is situated near∣ly
under the middle of the belly, which would
lead us to think, with M. de Buffon, that the
males cannot cover the females in the manner
of other quadrupeds. However, there is only
a slight difference of situation. When they in∣clined
to copulate, I perceived that the female
bowed down her head and neck, and leaned
her two fore legs, which were also bended, up∣on
the root of a tree, as if she meant to pro∣strate
herself on the ground; and the two hind
legs remained erect, which gave the male an
opportunity of embracing her as other quadru∣peds
do. I can likewise affirm, that the fe∣males
go with young about nine months.
Moreover, the elephants never copulate, unless
when in a state of freedom. In the season of
love, the males are strongly chained for four
or five weeks, during which time, they dis∣charge
<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
vast quantities of semen, and are so fu∣rious,
that their cornacks or governours can∣not
come near them without danger. The ap∣proach
of the rutting season is easily known;
for, some days before it happens, an oily liquor
flows from a small hole on each side of the
head. The domestic female, on these occa∣sions,
sometimes makes her escape, and joins
the wild males in the woods. Some days af∣terward,
her cornack goes in quest of her, and
calls her by her name till she comes. She sub∣mits
to him with complacence, and allows her∣self
to be conducted home, and shut up in the
stable. It was from cases of this kind that it
was discovered that the females bring forth a∣bout
the end of nine months.”</P>
<P>The first remark, with regard to the mode of
copulating, seems to be unquestionable, since M.
Marcel Bles assures us, that he has seen the ele∣phants
perform the operation. But, as to the
time of gestation, which he limits to nine months,
we ought to suspend our judgment, because all
travellers affirm, that the female elephant is
believed to go with young no less than two years.</P>

<HEAD>THE RHINOCEROS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The rhinoceros has one large horn, sometimes two, pla∣ced near the end of the nose; it is sometimes three feet and a half long, black, and smooth. The upper lip is long, hangs over the lower, ends in a point, is very pliable, and serves to collect its food, and deliver it into the mouth. The nostrils are placed transversely. The ears are large, erect, and point∣ed. The eyes are small and dull. The skin is naked, rough, or tuberculated, and lies about the neck in vast folds. There is another fold from the shoulders to the fore legs, and an∣other from the hind part of the back to the thighs. The skin is so thick and so strong as to turn the edge of a scymeter, and resist a musket ball. The tail is slender, flatted at the end, and covered on the sides with very stiff, thick, black hairs. The belly hangs low. The legs are short, strong, and thick. The hoofs are divided into three parts, each pointing for∣ward; <HI>Pennant's synops. of quad. p.</HI> 75.</P>

Be∣tween these folds were harboured insects, millepeds, scorpions, small serpents, &amp;c. He was not above three years old when his figure was drawn. His penis, when extended, spread out in form of a flower de luce.” In a corner of the plate I have given a figure of the penis. As this figure was commu∣nicated to me by Dr Tyson, I had not an opportunity of con∣sulting the author, whether these noxious insects, which he says take up their abode in the folds of the animal's skin, were seen by himself, or whether he only related what had been told him by the Indians. I acknowledge that the fact appears very singular; <HI>Edward's Gleanings, p. 25. Note.</HI> This last fact is not only doubtful, but that of the animal's age, compared with his largeness, appears to be false. We saw a rhinoceros of, at least, eight years of age, which exceeded not five feet in length. Mr▪ Parsons saw one of two years, which was not higher than a heifer, which may be computed at about four feet. How, then, could the rhinoceros above taken notice of be only three years old, if it was seven feet high?</NOTE>.

In magnitude, therefore, he makes a near ap∣proach
to the elephant; and he appears to be
much less, only because his legs are proportion∣ally
shorter than those of the elephant. But he
differs still more from the elephant in his natu∣ral
powers and intelligence; for Nature has be∣stowed
on him nothing that elevates him above
the ordinary rank of quadrupeds. He is depri∣ved
of all sensibility in his skin; neither has he
hands to enable him to improve by the sense of
touching; and, instead of a trunk, he has only a
moveable lip, to which all his means of dexterity
or address is limited. His chief sources of supe∣riority
over other animals consists in his strength,
his magnitude, and the offensive weapon on his
nose, which is entirely peculiar to him. This
weapon is a very hard horn, solid throughout its
whole extent, and situated more advantageously
than the horns of ruminating animals, which de∣fend
only the superior parts of the head and neck.
But the horn of the rhinoceros preserves from
insult the muzzle, the mouth, and the face. For
this reason, the tiger will rather attack the ele∣phant,
whose trunk he lays hold of, than the rhi∣noceros,
whom he dare not face, without run∣ning
the risk of having his bowels torn out; for
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
the body and limbs of the rhinoceros are covered
with a skin so impenetrable, that he fears neither
the claws of the tiger or lion, nor the sword or
shot of the hunter. His skin is blackish,
being of the same colour, but thicker and harder than
that of the elephant, and is not sensible of the
stinging of flies. He can neither extend nor
contract his skin, which is rolled up into large
folds at the neck, the shoulders, and the crupper,
in order to facilitate the motion of his head and
limbs, which last are massy, and terminated by
large feet, armed with three great toes. His
head is proportionally longer than that of the
elephant; but his eyes are still smaller, and sel∣dom
above half open. The upper lip, which
projects over the under one, is moveable, and can
be stretched out about six or seven inches in
length; and it is terminated by a pointed appen∣dix,
which gives this animal a power of collect∣ing
herbage in handfuls as the elephant does with
its trunk. This muscular and flexible lip is a
kind of hand or imperfect trunk; but it enables
the creature to seize any object with force, and
to feel with some dexterity. Instead of those
long ivory tusks which constitute the armour of
the elephant, the rhinoceros has a formidable
horn, and two strong incisive teeth in each jaw.
These teeth, of which the elephant is deprived,
are situated at a great distance from each other,
one in each angle of the jaw. The under jaw is
square before; and there are no other incisive
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
teeth in the anterior part of the mouth, which is
covered by the lips. But, beside the four cut∣ting
teeth in the four corners of the mouth, there
are twenty-four grinders, six on each side of the
two jaws. He holds his ears always erect: In
figure they resemble those of the hog; but they
are proportionally smaller. The ears are the
only parts of the body on which there are hairs,
or rather bristles. The extremity of the tail,
like that of the elephant, is garnished with a bush
of large, solid, hard bristles.</P>
<P>Dr Parsons, a celebrated physician in London,
to whom the republic of letters is much indebt∣ed
for many valuable discoveries in natural hi∣story,
and to whom I owe the highest acknow∣lodgments
for the marks of esteem and of friend∣ship
with which he has been pleased to honour
me, published, in the year 1743, a history of the
rhinoceros, from which I shall the more willing∣ly
make extracts, because every composition of
that gentleman merits the attention and confi∣dence
of the public.</P>
<P>Though the rhinoceros was frequently exhi∣bited
in the Roman spectacles, from the days of
Pompey to those of Heliogabulus; though he
has often been transported into Europe in more
modern times; and though Bontius, Chardin,
and Kolben have drawn figures of him both in
India and Africa; yet so ill was he represented
and described, that he was very imperfectly
known till the errors and caprices of those who
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
had published figures of him were detected by
inspection of the animals which arrived in Lon∣don
in the years 1739 and 1741. The figure
given by Albert Durer was the first, and the least
conformable to Nature; yet it was copied by most
naturalists, some of whom loaded it with pre∣posterous
drapery and foreign ornaments. That
of Bontius is more simple and correct; but the
inferior part of the legs is improperly represent∣ed.
That of Chardin, on the contrary, gives
a pretty good idea of the feet, and the folds of
the skin; but, in other respects, it has no re∣semblance
to the animal. That of Camerarius
is no better; neither is that drawn from the rhi∣noceros
exhibited at London in the year 1685,
and which was published by Carwitham in the
1739. In fine, the figures on the antient pave∣ment
of Praeneste, and on Domitian's medals,
are extremely imperfect; but they have the me∣rit
of not being deformed by the imaginary or∣naments
represented in the figure drawn by Al∣bert
Durer. Dr Parsons has taken the trouble of
drawing this animal himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of our learned philosophers, M. de Mours, has made some remarks on this subject, which must not be omitted. “The figure,” says he, “of the rhinoceros which Dr Parsons has ad∣ded to his Memoir, and which he drew from the life, is so dif∣ferent from that engraved at Paris in the year 1749, from a rhinoceros exhibited at the fair of Saint Germain, that it is difficult to recognise them to be the same animal. That of Dr Parsons is shorter, and the folds of the skin are fewer in number, less marked, and some of them placed in a different position. The head, particularly, has hardly any resemblance to that of the Saint-German rhinoceros. We cannot, howe∣ver, entertain a doubt with regard to the accuracy of Dr Parsons. The reasons of such remarkable differences must be sought for in the age and sex of the two animals. That of Dr Parsons was drawn from a male rhinoceros, which exceeded not the age of two years. That which I have here added, was drawn from a picture of the celebrated M. Oudry, a most distinguish∣ed animal painter. He painted from the life, and of the na∣tural size, the Saint-Germain rhinoceros, which was a female, and at least eight years old; I say, at lead eight years; for we see, by an inscription written on the bottom of a wooden print, entitled, <HI>A true portrait of a living rhinoceros exhibited at the fair of Saint-Germain in Paris,</HI> that this animal, when taken, in the 1741, in the province of Assem, belonging to the Mo∣gul, was three years old: And, eight lines lower, it is said, that the animal was only one month old when some Indians entangled it with ropes, after having stain the mother by their spears and darts. Hence it must have been at least eight years of age, and might be ten or twelve. This difference of age is probably the reason of the remarkable differences be∣tween Dr Parsons's figure and that of M. Oudry, whose pic∣ture, executed by the order of the King, was exhibited in the painter's hall. I shall only remark, that M. Oudry has made the horn of his rhinoceros too long; for I examined the ani∣mal with great attention, and I find that this part is better represented in the wooden print. The horn of the present fi∣gure was drawn after this print, and the rest is copied from M. Oudry's picture. The animal which it represents was weighed, about a year before, at Stouquart, in the dutchy of Wittemberg, and its weight was at that time five hundred pounds. It eat, according to the relation of Captain Dowe∣mot Wan-dermeer, who conducted it to Europe, sixty pounds of hay, and twenty pounds of bread, every day. It was very tame, and surprisingly agile, considering the enormity of its mass, and its unwieldy aspect.” These remarks, like all those of M. de Mours, are judicious and sensible. See the figure in his French translation of the Philosophical Transactions, ann. 1743.</NOTE> in three different
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
views, before, behind, and in profile. He has
likewise drawn the male organs of generation,
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
the single and double horns, as well as the tail,
from other rhinoceroses, whose parts are preser∣ved
in the cabinets of natural history.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros which came to London in the
year 1739, was sent from Bengal. Though not
above two years of age, the expence of his food
and journey amounted to near one thousand
pounds Sterling. He was fed with rice, sugar,
and hay. He had daily seven pounds of rice,
mixed with three pounds of sugar, and divided
into three portions. He had likewise hay and
green herbs, which last he preferred to hay.
His drink was water, of which he took large
quantities at a time. He was of a peaceable dis∣position,
and allowed all parts of his body to be
touched. When hungry, or struck by any per∣son,
he became mischievous, and, in both cases,
nothing appeased him but food. When enra∣ged,
he sprung forward, and nimbly raised him∣self
to a great height, pushing, at the same time,
his head furiously against the walls, which he
performed with amazing quickness, notwith∣standing
his heavy aspect and unwieldy mass.
I often observed, says Dr Parsons, these move∣ments
produced by rage or impatience, especial∣ly
in the mornings before his rice and sugar
were brought to him. The vivacity and promp∣titude
of his movements, Dr Parsons adds, led
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
me to think, that he is altogether unconquerable,
and that he could easily overtake any man who
should offend him.</P>
<P>This rhinoceros, at the age of two years, was
not taller than a young cow that has never pro∣duced.
But his body was very long and very
thick. His head was disproportionally large.
From the ears to the horn there is a concavity,
the two extremities of which, namely the upper
end of the muzzle, and the part near the ears,
are considerably raised. The horn, which was
not yet above an inch high, was black, smooth
at the top, but full of wrinkles directed back∣ward
at the base. The nostrils are situated ve∣ry
low, being not above an inch distant from
the opening of the mouth. The under lip is
pretty similar to that of the ox; but the upper
lip has a greater resemblance to that of the horse,
with this advantageous difference, that the rhi∣noceros
can lengthen this lip, move it from side to side,
roll it about a staff, and seize with it a∣ny
object he wishes to carry to his mouth. The
tongue of this young rhinoceros was soft, like
that of a calf<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Most voyagers and all naturalists, both antient and mo∣dern, tell us, that the tongue of the rhinoceros is very rough, and its papillae so sharp, that, with the tongue alone, he tore the flesh from a man's body even to the bones. This fact, which is every where related, appears to be very suspicious and ill imagined; because the rhinoceros does not eat flesh, and animals, in general, which have rough tongues, are sel∣dom carniv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.</NOTE>. His eyes had no vivacity: In
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
figure, they resembled those of the hog, and
were situated lower, or nearer the nostrils, than
in any other quadruped. His ears are large,
thin at the extremities, and contracted at their
origin by a kind of annular rugosity. The neck
is very short, and surrounded with two large
folds of skin. The shoulders are very thick,
and, at their juncture, there is another fold of
skin, which descends upon the fore legs. The
body of this young rhinoceros was very thick,
and pretty much resembled that of a cow about
to bring forth. Between the body and crupper
there is another fold, which descends upon the
hind legs. Lastly, another fold transversely sur∣rounds
the inferior part of the crupper, at some
distance from the tail. The belly was large, and
hang near the ground, particularly its middle
part. The legs are round, thick, strong, and
their joint bended backwards. This joint,
which, when the animal lies, is covered with a
remarkable fold of the skin, appears when he
stands. The tail is thin, and proportionally
short; that of the rhinoceros so often mention∣ed,
exceeded not sixteen or seventeen inches in
length. It turns a little thicker at the extremity,
which is garnished with some short, thick, hard
hairs. The form of the penis is very extraor∣dinary.
It is contained in a prepuce or sheath,
like that of the horse; and the first thing that
appears in the time of erection, is a second pre∣puce,
of a flesh-colour, from which there issues
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
a hollow tube, in the form of a funnel cut and
bordered somewhat like a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower de luce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. No. 470. pl. 111. Edwards Gleanings.</NOTE>, and
constitutes the glans and extremity of the penis.
This anomalous glans is of a paler flesh-colour
than the second prepuce. In the most vigorous
erection, the penis extends not above eight in∣ches
out of the body; and it is easily procured
by rubbing the animal with a handful of straw
when he lies at his ease. The direction of this
organ is not straight, but bended backward.
Hence he throws out his urine behind; and,
from this circumstance, it may be inferred, that
the male covers not the female, but that they u∣nite
with their cruppers to each other. The fe∣male
organs are situated like those of the cow,
and she exactly resembles the male in figure and
grossness of body. The skin is so thick and im∣penetrable,
that, when a man lays hold of any
of the folds, he would imagine he is touching a
wooden plank of half an inch thick. When
tanned, Dr Grew remarks, it is excessively hard,
and thicker than the hide of any other terrestri∣al
animal. It is every where covered more or
less with incrustations in the form of galls or
tuberosities, which are pretty small on the top
of the neck and back, but become larger on the sides.
The largest are on the shoulders and
crupper, are still pretty large on the thighs and
legs, upon which they are spread all round, and
even on the feet. But, between the folds, the
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
skin is penetrable, delicate, and as soft to the
touch as silk, while the external part of the
fold is equally hard with the rest. This tender
skin between the folds is of a light flesh-colour;
and the skin of the belly is nearly of the same
colour and consistence. These galls or tuberosi∣ties
should not be compared, as some authors
have done, to scales. They are only simple in∣durations
of the skin, without any regularity in
their figure, or symmetry in their respective po∣sitions.
The flexibility of the skin in the folds
enables the rhinoceros to move with facility his
head, neck, and members. The whole body,
except at the joints, is inflexible, and resembles a
coat of mail. Dr Parsons remarks, that this animal
listened with a deep and long continued atten∣tion
to any kind of noise; and that, though he
was sleeping, eating, or obeying any other pres∣sing
demands of nature, he raised his head, and
listened till the noise ceased.</P>
<P>In fine, after giving this accurate description
of the rhinoceros, Dr Parsons examines whe∣ther
the rhinoceros, with a double horn, exists;
and, having compared the testimonies of the an∣tients
and moderns, and the remains of this va∣riety
in the collections of natural objects, he,
with much probability, concludes, that the rhinoce∣roses
of Asia have commonly but one horn, and
that those of Africa have generally two.</P>
<P>It is unquestionably true, that some rhinoce∣roses
have but one horn, and that others have
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kolben asserts positively, and as if he had been an eye witness, that the first horn of the rhinoceros is upon the nose, and the second upon the front, in a right line with the first; that the latter, which is brown, never exceeds two feet in length; and that the second is yellow, and seldom longer than six inches; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne Esperance, tom. 3. p.</HI> 17.—But we have already mentioned double horns, the second differing very little from the first, which was two feet long, and both were of the same colour. Besides, it appears to be certain, that they are never at such a distance from each other, as this author has placed them; for the bases of the two horns, preserved in the cabinet of Sir Hans Sloane, were not three inches asunder.</NOTE>. But it is not equally certain that this
variety is constant, and depends on the climate
of Africa or India; or that this difference is alone
sufficient to constitute two distinct species. It
appears that the rhinoceroses, with one horn,
have this excrescence always longer than those
with two. There are single horns of three and
a half, and perhaps of above four feet in length,
by six or seven inches diameter at the base. Some
double horns are two feet long<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ursus cornu gemino;</HI> Martial. spectac. ep. 22. Phil. Trans. abrid. vol. 9. p. 100. vol. 11. p. 910. Phil. Trans. vol. 56. p. 32. tab. 2.

are commonly of a brown or olive colour;
though there are instances of their being gray,
and even white. They have only a slight con∣cavity
in form of a cup under the base, by which
they are fixed to the skin of the nose. The rest
of the horn is solid and harder than common
horn. It is with this weapon that the rhinoce∣ros
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
is said to attack and sometimes mortally
wound the largest elephants, whose tall legs give
the rhinoceros an opportunity of striking, with
his snout and horn, their bellies, where the skin
is most tender and penetrable. But, if he misses
his first blow, the elephant throws him on the
ground and kills him.</P>
<P>The horn of the rhinoceros is more esteemed
by the Indians than the ivory of the elephant,
not on account of its real utility, though they make several toys of it with the chisel and tur∣ner's

qualities they ascribe to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunt in regno Bengaleu rhinocerotes Lusitanis <HI>Abadas</HI> dicti, cujus animalis corium, dentes, caro, sanguis, ungulae et caeterae ejus panes toto genere resistunt venenis; qua de causa in maximo pretio est apud Indos.—In these parts of Bengal which border on the Ganges, the rhinoceroses or uni∣corns, there called <HI>Abades,</HI> are very common, and numbers of their horns are brought to Goa.

But of all plants he is fondest of a shrub which resembles the juniper, and is called the <HI>rhinoceros shrub.</HI> Great quantities of it grow on heathy lands and on the mountains; <HI>Descript. du Cap. de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 17.</NOTE>. He is fond

of the sugar cane, and likewise eats all kinds of
grain. Having no appetite for flesh, he neither
disturbs the small, nor fears the large animals,
but lives in peace with all, not excepting the
tiger, who often accompanies the rhinoceros,
without daring to attack him. This peaceful
disposition renders the combats between the ele∣phant
and the rhinoceros very suspicious: Such
combats must at least be rare, since there is no
motive to war on either side. Besides, no an∣tipathy
has ever been remarked between these
animals. They have been known, even in a
state of captivity, to live peaceably together,
without discovering any marks of resentment or
antipathy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutch history, entitled <HI>l'Ambassade de la Chine,</HI> gives a false description of this animal, especially when it exhibits the rhinoceros as the chief enemy of the elephant; for the rhinoceros I am mentioning was kept in the same liable with two elephants, and I have several times seen them near each other, without discovering the smallest antipathy. An Aethi∣opian ambassador had brought this animal as a present; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 3. p.</HI> 45.</NOTE>. Pliny, I believe, is the first author
who mentions these combats between the ele∣phant
and rhinoceros. It appears that these a∣nimals
were compelled to fight at the Roman
spectacles<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Romans took pleasure in making the rhinoceros and elephant fight at their public shews; <HI>Singular, de la France Antarctique, par André Thevet, p.</HI> 41.</NOTE>; and from hence, probably, the
idea was formed, that these animals, when in
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
their natural state of liberty, fight in the same
manner. But every action without a motive is
unnatural; it is an effect without a cause, which
cannot happen but by accident.</P>
<P>The rhinoceroses assemble not, nor march in
troops, like the elephants. They are more so∣litary
and savage; and it is, perhaps, more dif∣ficult
to hunt and to overcome them. They
never attack men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rhinoceros never attacks any person, nor becomes furious, unless he is provoked, and then his ferocity is tre∣mendous; he grunts like a hog, and overturns trees and every thing that comes in his way; <HI>Voyage de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 7. p.</HI> 278.</NOTE>, unless they are provo∣ked,
when they become furious and formi∣dable.
Their skin is so hard as to resist sabres,
lances, javelins, and even musket balls<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">His skin is thick, hard, and rough.... It is even im∣penetrable by the sabres of the Japanese, and coats of arms, bucklers, &amp;c. are made of it; <HI>Id. Ibid. p.</HI> 483.—The rhinoce∣ros seldom attacks men, unless when provoked, or the man wears a rod habit. In both these cases, he becomes furious, and overturns every thing that opposes him. When these animals attack a man, they seize him by the middle of the body, and toss him up with such force, that he is killed by the fall.... However enraged he may be, it is easy to a∣void his approach: He is, indeed, very swift; but he turns with great difficulty. Besides, according to my information, he sees only what is before him. Hence, when he comes within a few paces, we have only to step to a side; for he then loses sight of us, and it is very difficult for him to re∣turn in quest of us. I have experienced this fact, having more than once seen him advance toward me with all his fury; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 17.</NOTE>. The
only penetrable parts of his body are the belly,
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
the eyes, and about the ears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to kill him; and men never attack him without danger of being torn to pieces. Those who are accustomed to hunt the rhinoceros find means, however, to de∣fend themselves from his fury; for he is fond of marshy grounds; they observe when he repairs thither, and, concealing themselves among the bushes opposite to the direction of the wind, they watch till he lies down either to sleep or to wallow, that they may have an opportunity of shooting him near the ears, where alone he can receive a mortal wound. They place themselves against the wind; because the scent of the rhinoceros is so acute▪ that he never approaches any object he perceives till the smell of it reaches his nostrils; <HI>Hist. Nat. de Siam, par Gervaise, p.</HI> 35.</NOTE>. Hence the
hunters, instead of attacking him face to face,
follow him at a distance by the tracks of his
feet, and watch till he lies down to sleep. We
have, in the royal cabinet, a foetus of a rhino∣ceros,
which was extracted from the body of
the mother, and sent to us from the island of
Java. By the memoir which accompanied this
foetus, we are informed, that twenty-eight hun∣ters
having assembled to attack the mother, they
followed her at a distance for some days, de∣taching
one or two of their number, from time
to time, in order to reconnoitre her situation;
that, by this means, they surprised her when
asleep, and silently approached so near, that the
whole twenty-eight muskets were discharged at
once into the lower part of her belly.</P>
<P>From the description given by Dr Parsons, it
appears that this animal has an acute and very
attentive ear. We are likewise assured that his
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
sense of smelling is excellent. But it is said,
that his eyes are not good, and that he sees such
objects only as are before him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preceding Note.—The eyes of the rhinoceros are very small, and he sees only forward. When he walks, or pursues his prey, he proceeds always in a direct line, forcing, overturning, and piercing through every obstruction that falls in his way. Neither bushes, nor trees, nor thickets of brambles, nor large stones, can turn him from his course. With the horn on his nose, he tears up trees, ruises stones high in the air, and throws them behind him to a considerable distance, and with a great noise: In a word, he overthrows every ob∣ject which he can lay hold of. When he is enraged, and meets with no obstruction, lowering his head, he plows the ground, and throws large quantities of earth over his head. He grunts like a hog: His cry, when in a state of tranquillity, does not reach far; but, when in pursuit of his prey, it may be heard at a great distance; <HI>Descript. du Cape de Bonne-espe∣rance, par Kolbe.</HI></NOTE>. The extreme
minuteness of his eyes, their low, oblique, and
deep situation, the dullness, and the small de∣gree
of motion they seem to possess, tend to con∣firm
this fact. His voice, when he is in a state
of tranquillity, is blunt, and resembles the grunt∣ing
of a hog; but, when enraged, it becomes
sharp, and is heard at a great distance. Though
he lives on vegetables only, he does not rumi∣nate.
Hence it is probable, that, like the ele∣phant,
he has but one stomach, and capacious
bowels, which supply the place of many sto∣machs.
His consumption of food, though con∣siderable,
is not near so great as that of the ele∣phant;
and it appears, from the density and un∣interrupted
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
thickness of his skin, that he also
loses much less by perspiration.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have seen a second rhinoceros, which was
lately brought to the royal menagerie. In the
month of September 1770, if the people who
conducted it can be credited, the animal was
only three months old. But, I am persuaded,
that it was at least two or three years of age;
for its body, including the head, was already
eight feet two inches long, five feet six inches
high, and eight feet two inches in circumfe∣rence.
A year afterward, its body was length∣ened
seven, inches; so that, on the 28th day of
August 1771, it was eight feet nine inches, in∣cluding
the length of the head, five feet nine
inches high, and eight feet nine inches in cir∣cumference.
On the 12th day of August 1772,
the length of the body, comprehending the head,
was nine feet four inches, the height of the
cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pper six feet four inches, and that of the wi∣thers
only five feet eleven inches. Its skin had
the colour and appearance of an old elm tree,
spotted in some places with black and gray, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubled into deep furrows, which form∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of scales. It had only one horn, the
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
colour of which was brown, and its substance solid and hard. The eyes were small and pro∣minent,
the ears large, and pretty similar to
those of an ass. The back, which was hollow
or depressed, seemed to be covered with a natu∣ral
saddle. The legs were short and very thick.
The feet were rounded behind, and divided be∣fore
into three hoofs. The tail resembled that
of an ox, and was garnished with black hairs at
the extremity. The penis lay along the testi∣cles,
and erected itself for the discharge of urine,
which the animal threw out to a great distance.
The point of it was also very remarkable, form∣ing
a cavity like the mouth of a trumpet. The
sheath from which it issues is fleshy, and of a
vermilion colour, like the penis itself. This
fleshy substance which formed the first tube,
came out of a second sheath composed of skin,
as in other quadrupeds. The tongue is so hard
and rough, that it tears off the skin of any per∣son
whom it licks; hence this animal eats large
thorns, without feeling any pain. The rhinoce∣ros
requires one hundred and sixty pounds of
food every day. His flesh is much relished by
the Indians and Africans, and especially by the
Hottentots. If trained when young, he might
be rendered domestic, and, in this state, he would
multiply more easily than the elephant.</P>
<P>“I could never discover the reason (M. P. re∣marks)
why in Asia the rhinoceros is allowed
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
to remain in a wild state, while in Abyssinia
he is rendered domestic, and is employed in
carrying burdens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defense des Recherches sur les Americains. p. 95.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“ M. de Buffon,” says Mr Bruce, “conjectured
that there were, in the interior parts of Africa,
rhinoceroses with two horns. This conjecture
is fully verified; for all the rhinoceroses I saw
in Abyssinia had two horns. The first, that is,
the one nearest the nose, is of the common
form; the second is sharp at the point, and
always shorter than the first. Both spring at
the same time; but the first grows more quick∣ly,
and exceeds the other in size, not only du∣ring
the time of growth, but during the whole
life of the animal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by Mr Bruce to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>On the other hand, M. Allamand, a very able
naturalist, wrote to M. Daubenton a letter, dated
at Leyden, October 31. 1766, in the following
terms:</P>
<P>“I recollect a remark of M. Parsons, in a
passage quoted by M. de Buffon: He suspect∣ed
that the rhinoceroses of Asia have but one
horn, and that those of the Cape of Good
Hope have two. I suspect the very opposite:
The heads of the rhinoceroses which I received
from Bengal and other parts of India, had al∣ways double horns, and all those which came

from the Cape of Good Hope had but one horn.”</P>
<P>This last passage proves what we have for∣merly
remarked, that the rhinoceroses with
double horns form a variety in the species, a
particular race, which is found equally in Asia
and Africa.</P>

<P>THE names <HI>Camel</HI> and <HI>Dromedary</HI> signify
not two different species, but only two di∣stinct
races of the camel, which have subsisted
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
long previous to the records of history. The
chief, and perhaps the only sensible character by
which these two races are distinguished, is, that
the camel has two bunches on the back, and the
dromedary but one. The latter is also somewhat
smaller and weaker than the camel. But both
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
of them intermix and produce; and the indivi∣duals
which proceed from this crossing of the
races, are the most vigorous, and preferred to all
others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Persians have several kinds of camels. Those with two bunches they call <HI>bughur,</HI> and those with one, <HI>schuttur.</HI> Of these last there are four kinds.

<P>The third kind, called <HI>Lohk,</HI> are not so good as the <HI>Bughur.</HI> When in season, they foam not, but push out from under their throat a red bladder, which they again retract with their breath, raise their heads, and often swell.

power. Figure to yourselves a country without
verdure, and without water, a burning sun, an
air always parched, sandy plains, mountains still
more adult, which the eye runs over without
perceiving a single animated being; a dead earth,
perpetually tossed with the winds, and present∣ing
nothing but bones, scattered flints, rocks per∣pendicular

more dreadful than that of the deepest forests;

him as a tomb: The light of the day,
more dismal than the darkness of night, serves
only to give him a clearer view of his own
wretchedness and impotence, and to conceal from
his view the barriers of the void, by extending
around him that immense abyss which separates
him from the habitable parts of the earth; an
abyss, which, in vain, he would attempt to tra∣verse;
for hunger, thirst, and scorching heat,
haunt every moment that remains to him be∣tween
despair and death.</P>
<P>The Arab, however, by the assistance of his
camel, has learned to surmount, and even to ap∣propriate,
these frightful intervals of Nature.
They serve him for an asylum, they secure his
repose, and maintain his independence. But
man never uses any thing without abuse? This
same free, independent, tranquil, and even rich
Arab, instead of regarding his deserts as the ram∣parts
of his liberty, pollutes them with his crimes.
He traverses them to carry off slaves and gold
from the adjacent nations. He employs them
for perpetrating his robberies, which unluckily
he enjoys more than his liberty; for his enter∣prises
are almost always successful. Notwith∣standing
the vigilance of his neighbours, and the
superiority of their strength, he escapes their pur∣suit,
<PB N="129" REF="144"/>
and carries off, with impunity, all that he
ravages from them. An Arab, who gives him∣self
up to this kind of terrestrial piracy, is early
accustomed to the fatigues of travelling, to
want of sleep, and to endure hunger, thirst, and
heat. With the same view, he instructs, rears,
and exercises his camels. A few days after their
birth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The young camels, soon after birth, are obliged to lie on the ground, with their four legs folded under their belly, for fifteen or twenty days, in order to enure them to this po∣sture. They never lie in another position. To learn them temperance and abstinence, they are then allowed very little milk; and, by this practice, they are trained to continue eight or ten days without drinking: And, as to victuals, it is asto∣nishing that so large an animal should live on so small a quan∣tity of food; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p.</HI> 28.</NOTE>, he folds their limbs under their belly,
forces them to remain on the ground, and, in
this situation, loads them with a pretty heavy
weight, which is never removed but for the pur∣pose
of replacing a greater. Instead of allowing
them to feed at pleasure, and to drink when they
are dry, he begins with regulating their meals,
and makes them gradually travel long journeys,
diminishing, at the same time, the quantity of
their aliment. When they acquire some strength,
they are trained to the course. He excites their
emulation by the example of horses, and, in time,
renders them equally swift, and more robust<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The dromedary is particularly remarkable for swiftness. The Arabs say, that he can travel as far in one day as one of their best horses can do in eight or ten. The <HI>Bekh,</HI> who con∣ducted us to mount Sinai, was mounted on one of these camels, and often amused us with the great fleetness of the animal on which he rode.

In fine, after he is certain of the strength, fleet∣ness,
and sobriety of his camels, he loads them
both with his own and their food, sets off with
them, arrives unperceived at the confines of the
desert, robs the first passengers he meets, pillages
the solitary houses, loads his camels with the
booty, and, if pursued, he is obliged to accelerate
his retreat. It is on these occasions that he un∣folds
his own talents and those of the camels.
He mounts one of the fleetest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dromedaries are so fleet that they march thirty-five or forty leagues a-day, and continue at this rate for eight or ten days through the desert, and eat extremely little.

During this period of motion and fatigue, his
camels are perpetually loaded, and he allows

ball of paste. They often run in this manner
nine or ten days, without finding water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The camel can dispense with drinking during four or five days. A small quantity of beans and barley, or rather some morsels of paste made of flour, are sufficient for his daily nourishment. This fact I often experienced in my journey to mount Sinai.

In Turkey, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Barbary,

Of all carriages, it is the cheap∣est
and most expeditious. The merchants and
other passengers unite in a caravan, to prevent
the insults and robberies of the Arabs. These
caravans are often very numerous, and are al∣ways
composed of more camels than men. Each
camel is loaded in proportion to his strength;
and, when over-loaded<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When about to be loaded, at the cry of their conductor, they instantly bend their knees. If any of them disobey, they are instantly struck with a stick, or their necks are pulled down; and then, as if constrained, and complaining in their own manner, they bend their knees, put their bellies on the earth, and remain in this posture till they are loaded and commanded to rise. This is the origin of those large cal∣losities on the parts of their bellies, limbs, and knees, which rest on the ground. If over-burdened, they give repeated blows with their heads to the person who oppresses them, and set up lamentable cries. Their ordinary load is double that which the strongest mule can carry; <HI>Voyage du P. Philippe, p.</HI> 369.</NOTE>, he refuses to march,

these commercial travels, their march is not
hastened: As the route is often seven or eight
hundred leagues, their motions and journeys
are regulated. They walk only, and perform
about from ten to twelve leagues each day. E∣very
night they are unloaded, and allowed to
pasture at freedom. When in a rich country,
or fertile meadow, they eat, in less than an
hour<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Victum cameli parcissimum, exiguique sumptus ferunt, et magnis laboribus robustissime resistunt—Nullum animal illius et molis citius comedit; <HI>Prosp. Alpin. Hist. Egypt. p.</HI> 225.</NOTE>, as much as serves them to ruminate the
whole night, and to nourish them during twen∣ty-four

for them. They even seem to prefer
wormwood, thistles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the camels are unloaded, they are allowed to go in quest of briars or brambles.—Though the camel is a large animal, he eats little, and is content with what he finds.

<P>Besides, this facility of abstaining long from
drink proceeds not from habit alone, but is ra∣ther
an effect of their structure. Independent
of the four stomachs, which are common to ru∣minating
animals, the camels have a fifth bag,
which serves them as a reservoir for water.
This fifth stomach is peculiar to the camel. It
is so large as to contain a vast quantity of wa∣ter,
where it remains without corrupting, or
mixing with the other aliments. When the
animal is pressed with thirst, and has occasion
for water to macerate his dry food in rumina∣ting,
he makes part of this water mount into his
<PB N="135" REF="150"/>
paunch, or even as high as the oesophagus, by
a simple contraction of certain muscles. It is
by this singular construction that the camel is
enabled to pass several days without drinking,
and to take at a time a prodigious quantity of
water, which remains in the reservoir pure and
limpid, because neither the liquors of the body,
nor the juices of digestion, can mix with it.</P>
<P>If we reflect on the dissimilarities in this ani∣mal
from other quadrupeds, we cannot doubt
that his nature has been considerably changed
by constraint, slavery, and perpetual labour. Of
all animals, the camel is the most antient, the
completest, and the most laborious slave. He is
the most antient slave, because he inhabits those
climates where men were first polished. He is
the most complete slave, because, in the other
species of domestic animals, as the horse, the dog,
the ox, the sheep, the hog, &amp;c. we still find in∣dividuals
in a state of nature, and which have
never submitted to men. But the whole species
of the camel is enslaved; for none of them ex∣ist
in their primitive state of liberty and indepen∣dence.
Lastly, he is the most laborious slave;
because he has never been nourished for pomp,
like most horses, nor for amusement, like most
dogs, nor for the use of the table, like the ox,
the hog, and the sheep; because he has always
been made a beast of burden, whom men have
never taken the trouble of yoking in machines,
but have regarded the body of the animal as a
<PB N="136" REF="151"/>
living carriage, which they may load, or overload,
even during sleep; for, when pressed, the load
is sometimes not taken off, but he lies down to
sleep under it, with his legs folded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the night, the camels sleep on their knees, and rumi∣nate what they have eaten during the day; <HI>Voyage du P. Philippe, p.</HI> 369.</NOTE>, and his
body resting on his stomach. Hence they per∣petually
bear the marks of servitude and pain.
Upon the under part of the breast, there is a
large callosity as hard as horn, and similar ones
on the joints of the limbs. Though these callo∣sities
are found on all camels, they exhibit a
proof that they are not natural, but produced by
excessive constraint and painful labour; for they
are often filled with pus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Having opened the callosities on the legs to examine their structure, which is a medium between fat and ligament, we found, in a small camel, that some of them contained a collection of thick pus. The callosity on the sternum was eight inches long, six broad, and two thick. In it likewise we found a great deal of pus; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 74.</NOTE>. The breast and legs,
therefore, are deformed by callosities; the back
is still more disfigured by one or two bunches.
The callosities, as well as the bunches, are per∣petuated
by generation. As it is obvious, that
the first deformity proceeds from the constant
practice of forcing these animals, from their ear∣liest
age<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As soon as a camel is brought forth, his four legs are folded under his body. After which, he is covered with a cloth, which hangs down to the ground, and on the borders of which a quantity of stones are laid, to prevent him from rising, and in this position he remains fifteen or twenty days. He is served with milk, but very sparingly, in order to ac∣custom him to drink little; <HI>Voyage it Tavernier, tom. 1. p.</HI> 161.</NOTE>, to lie on their stomach, with their limbs
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
folded under the body, and, in this situation, to
bear both the weight of their own bodies, and
that of the loads laid on their backs, we ought
to presume that the bunch or bunches have also
originated from the unequal pressure of heavy
burdens, which would naturally make the flesh,
fat, and skin swell; for these bunches are not
osseous, but composed of a fleshy substance simi∣lar
to that of a cow's udder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The flesh of the camel is insipid, especially that of the bunch, the taste of which resembles that of a fat cow's udder; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p.</HI> 50.</NOTE>. Hence the cal∣losities
and bunches should be equally regarded
as deformities produced by continual labour and
bodily constraint; and, though at first accidental
and individual, they are now become permanent
and common to the whole species. We may
likewise presume, that the bag which contains
the water, and is only an appendix to the paunch,
has been produced by an unnatural extension of
this viscus. The animal, after suffering thirst
for a long time, by taking at once as much, and
perhaps more water than the stomach could ea∣sily
contain, this membrane would be gradually
extended and dilated; in the same manner as
we have seen the stomach of a sheep extend in
proportion to the quantity of its aliment. In
sheep fed with grain, the stomach is very small;
<PB N="138" REF="153"/>
but becomes very large in those fed with her∣bage
alone.</P>
<P>These conjectures would be either fully con∣firmed
or destroyed, if we had wild camels to
compare with the domestic. But these animals
no where exist in a natural state, or, if they do,
no man has observed or described them. We
ought to suppose, therefore, that every thing
good and beautiful belongs to Nature, and that
whatever is defective and deformed in these ani∣mals
proceeds from the labours and slavery im∣posed
on them by the empire of man. These
inoffensive creatures must suffer much; for they
utter the most lamentable cries, especially when
overloaded. But, though perpetually oppressed,
their fortitude is equal to their docility. At the
first signal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The camels are so obedient to their master, that, when he wants to load or unload them, by a single word or signal, they instantly lie down on their bellies.

When the time of loading arives, the same camel comes and lies down between the bales, and, after they are fixed, rises softly with his load. This ex∣ercise he performs in a short time, and without the smallest trouble or noise; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 1. p.</HI> 160.</NOTE>, they bend their knees and lie down

and regulates the march of all the followers.

by the sound of some instrument<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The camels rejoice at the harmonious sound of the voice, or of some instrument.....

resuming their song, they proceed on their
march for several hours more, and the singing is
continued till they arrive at another resting place,
when the camels again lie down; and their loads,
by unloosing the ropes, are allowed to glide off
on each side of the animals. Thus they sleep on
their bellies in the middle of their baggage, which,
next morning, is fixed on their backs with equal
quickness and facility as it had been detached the
evening before.</P>

to whom, at all other times, they are very

from that of all other quadrupeds; for the fe∣male,
instead of standing, lies down on her knees,
and receives the male in the same position that
she reposes, or is loaded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the camels copulate, the female lies down in the same manner as when she is about to be loaded.

But, in copulating, the female lies on her belly, and receives the male in that position; <HI>Voyage de Olearius, tom. 1. p.</HI> 553.</NOTE>. This posture, to
which the animals are early accustomed, becomes
natural, since they assume it spontaneously in
coition. The time of gestation is near twelve
months<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The females go with young near twelve months, or from one spring to the following; <HI>Shaw's travels.</HI></NOTE>, and, like all large quadrupeds, the fe∣males
bring forth only one at a birth. Her milk
is copious and thick; and, when mixed with
a large quantity of water, affords an excellent
nourishment to men. The females are not o∣bliged
to labour, but are allowed to pasture and

produce at full liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camelos foeminas intactas propter earum lac servant, eas omni labore solutas vagari permittentes per loca sylvestria pascentes, &amp;c.; <HI>Prosp. Alpin. Hist. Aegypt, part. 1. p.</HI> 226.</NOTE>. The advantage deri∣ved

superior to what could be drawn from their

females are castrated<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The males are castrated; and the females sometimes un∣dergo a similar operation, which renders them stronger and larger; <HI>Wotton, p.</HI> 82.</NOTE>, in order to fit them for

instead of diminishing, augments their strength,
vigour, and plumpness. In general, the fatter
camels are, they are the more capable of endu∣ring
great fatigue. Their bunches seem to pro∣ceed
from a redundance of nourishment; for,
during long journeys, in which their conductor
is obliged to husband their food, and where they
often suffer much hunger and thirst, these bunch∣es
gradually diminish, and become so flat, that
the place where they were is only perceptible by
the length of the hair, which is always longer
on these parts than on the rest of the back. The
meagerness of the body augments in proportion
as the bunches decrease. The Moors, who trans∣port
all articles of merchandise from Barbary and
Numidia, as far as Aethiopia, set out with their
camels well laden, which are very fat and vigo∣rous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the camels begin their journey, it is necessary that they should be fat; for, when this animal has travelled forty or fifty days without having barley to eat, the fat of the bunches begins to diminish, then that of the belly, and, lastly, that of the limbs; after which he is no longer able to carry his load.... The caravans of Africa, which travel to Aethiopia, never think of bringing back their camels; be∣cause they transport no heavy goods from that country; and, when they arrive, they sell their meagre animals; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p.</HI> 49.—Camelos macilentos, dorsique vul∣neribus saucios, vili pretio Desertorum incolis saginandos di∣vendunt; <HI>Leon.

multiply, and the individuals of whom he con∣quers

<P>Having little to add to what has been said
with regard to the camel and dromedary, we
<PB N="148" REF="163"/>
shall content ourselves with quoting a passage
from M. Niebuhr's description of Arabia, <HI>p.</HI> 144.</P>
<P>“In the country of Iman, most of the camels
are of a middle stature, and of a bright brown
colour; some of them, however, are large,
heavy, and of a deep brown colour. When
about to copulate, the female lies down on her
legs; and the people tie her fore legs to pre∣vent
her from rising. The male sits on his
posteriors like a dog, with his two fore feet
resting on the ground. He seems to be cold∣er
and more indifferent than any other animal;
for he often requires to be teazed a long time
before the ardour of love is excited. When
the operation is finished, the female is sudden∣ly
raised, and forced to walk. The same thing,
it is said, takes place in Mesopotamia, Natolia,
and probably every where else.”</P>
<P>I remarked, that camels had been transported
to the Canaries, Antilles, and Peru; but that they
had not succeeded in any part of the New World.
Dr Brown, in his history of Jamaica, affirms, that
he saw dromedaries there, which the English, in
former times, had transported thither in great
numbers, and that, though they still subsist, they
are of little use; because the inhabitants are ig∣norant
of the proper manner of feeding and
treating these animals. They, however, multi∣ply
in all these climates, and I doubt not but
they might produce even in France. We see
from the Gazette of June 9. 1775, that M. Brin∣kenof
<PB N="149" REF="164"/>
having made a male and female camel
copulate in his territories near Berlin, obtained
on the 24th day of March 1775, after a period of
twelve months, a young camel, which was healthy
and vigorous. This fact confirms what I said
concerning the production of dromedaries and
camels at Dresden; and I am persuaded, that, if
we had Arabian servants, who know how to
manage these animals, we might soon render this
species domestic, which I consider as the most
useful of all quadrupeds.</P>

has no name in the languages of these people.
Even the word <HI>Buffalo</HI> indicates a foreign ori∣gin;
for it has no root either in Greek or Latin.
In a word, this animal is a native of the warm
<PB N="152" REF="169"/>
regions of Africa and the Indies, and was not
transported and naturalized in Italy till about
the seventh century. The moderns have im∣properly
applied to him the name <HI>bubalus,</HI> which,
indeed, denotes an African animal, but very dif∣ferent
from the buffalo, as might be shown from
many passages of antient authors. If the buba∣lus
were to be referred to a particular genus, he
would rather belong to that of the antilope than
to that of the ox. Belon, having seen at Cairo
a small ox with a bunch on its back, which dif∣fered
from the buffalo and common ox, imagined
that it might be the bubalus of the antients.
But, if he had carefully compared the characters
given by the antients to the bubalus, with those
of this small ox, he would have discovered his
error. Besides, we are enabled to speak of it
with certainty; for we have seen it alive; and,
after comparing the description we have given of
it with that of Belon, we cannot hesitate in pro∣nouncing
it to be the same animal. It was ex∣hibited
at the fair of Paris in the year 1752,
under the name of <HI>Zebu,</HI> which we have adopt∣ed
to denote this animal, because it is a parti∣cular
race of the ox, and not a species of the
buffalo or bubalus.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="170"/>
Aristotle, when treating of oxen, mentions
not the common ox, but only remarks, that, a∣mong
the <HI>Arachotas</HI> in India, there are wild
oxen, which differ from the domestic kind as
much as the wild boar differs from the common
hog. But, in another place, as quoted above
in the notes, he gives a description of a wild ox
in Poeonia, a province bordering on Macedonia,
which he calls <HI>bonasus.</HI> Thus the common ox
and the bonasus are the only animals of this kind
mentioned by Aristotle; and, what, is singular,
the bonasus, though fully described by this great
philosopher, was unknown to the Greek and
Latin naturalists who wrote after him; for they
have all copied him verbatim on this subject:
So that, at present, we only know the name <HI>bo∣nasus,</HI>
without being able to distinguish the ani∣mal
to which it ought to be applied. If we
consider, however, that Aristotle, when speaking
of the wild oxen of temperate climates, mentions
the bonasus only, and that, on the contrary, the
Greeks and Latins of after ages take no notice of
the bonasus, but point out these wild oxen under
the appellations of <HI>urus</HI> and <HI>bison,</HI> we will be in∣duced
to think that the bonasus must be either
the one or the other of these animals; and, in∣deed,
by comparing what Aristotle has said of
the bonasus, with what we know concerning the
bison, it is probable that these two names denote
the same animal. The urus is first mentioned
by Julius Caesar; Pliny and Pausanias are also
<PB N="154" REF="171"/>
the first who announced the bison. From the
time of Pliny, the name <HI>bubalus</HI> has been indis∣criminately
applied to the urus or the bison.
Confusion always augments as time advances.
To the bonasus, bubalus, urus, and bison, have
been added the <HI>catopleba,</HI> the <HI>thur,</HI> the bubalus
of Belon, the Scots and American bisons; and
all our naturalists have made as many different
species as they have found names. Here truth is
so environed with darkness and error, that it will
be difficult to elucidate this part of natural histo∣ry,
which the contrariety of evidence, the varie∣ty
of descriptions, the multiplicity of denomina∣tions,
the diversity of places, the differences of
languages, and the obscurity of time, seemed to
have condemned to perpetual darkness.</P>
<P>I shall first give my opinion on this subject,
and afterwards produce the proofs of it.</P>
<P>1. The animal we call <HI>buffalo</HI> was unknown
to the antients.</P>
<P>2. The buffalo, now domestic in Europe, is
the same as the domestic or wild buffalo of In∣dia
and Africa.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>bubalus</HI> of the Greeks and Romans
is neither the buffalo nor the small ox of Belon,
but the animal described in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences under the name of the
<HI>Barbary cow,</HI> and which we call <HI>bubalus.</HI></P>
<P>4. The small ox of Belon, which we have
seen, and distinguished by the name <HI>zebu,</HI> is on∣ly
a variety of the common ox.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="172"/>
5. The <HI>bonasus</HI> of Aristotle is the same ani∣mal
with the bison of the Latins.</P>
<P>6. The <HI>bison</HI> of America might proceed ori∣ginally
from the European bison.</P>
<P>7. The <HI>urus</HI> or <HI>aurochs</HI> is the same animal
with the common bull in its natural and wild
state.</P>
<P>8. The bison differs from the aurochs by
accidental varieties only; and, consequently,
it is, as well as the aurochs, of the same species
with the domestic ox; so that I think I shall be
able to reduce all the denominations, and all the
pretended species both of antient and modern
naturalists, to three, namely, the ox, the buffalo,
and the bubalus.</P>
<P>Some of the propositions I am about to lay
down, will, I doubt not, appear to be mere as∣sertions,
particularly to those who have been ac∣customed
to study the nomenclators of animals,
or have attempted to give lists of them. There
are none of these assertions, however, which I
am not able to prove. But, before entering in∣to
critical discussions, each of which requires
particular propositions, I shall relate the facts and
remarks which led me into this research; and,
as they have satisfied myself, I hope they will be
equally satisfactory to others.</P>
<P>Domestic animals differ, in many respects,
from wild animals. Their nature, their size,
and their form are more fluctuating, and subject
to greater changes, especially in the external
<PB N="156" REF="173"/>
parts of the body. The influence of climate,
which acts powerfully upon all Nature, exerts it∣self
with greater efficacy upon captive than upon
free animals. Food prepared by the hand of
man, which is often ill chosen, and sparingly ad∣ministered,
joined to the inclemency of a foreign
sky, produce, in the progress of time, alterations
so deeply engraven that they become constant,
and are transmitted to posterity. I pretend not
to maintain, that this general cause of change is
so powerful as to alter essentially the nature of
beings, whose constitution is so permanently fix∣ed
as that of animals. But it transforms and
masks their external appearance; it annihilates
some parts, and gives rise to others; it paints
them with various colours; and, by its action on
the temperament of the body, it has an influence
on the dispositions, instincts, and other internal
qualities. The modification of a single part, in
a machine so perfect as that of an animal's body,
is sufficient to make the whole feel the effects of
the alteration. It is for this reason that our
domestic animals differ nearly as much in dispo∣sitions
and instincts, as in figure, from those who
enjoy their natural state of freedom. Of this
the sheep affords a striking example. This spe∣cies,
in its present condition, could not exist
without the care and defence of man: It is also
much changed, and very inferior to its original
species. But, not to depart from our chief ob∣ject,
we see how many alterations the ox has
<PB N="157" REF="174"/>
undergone, from the combined effects of climate,
food, and management, in a wild, and in a do∣mestic
state.</P>
<P>The bunch which some oxen carry between
their shoulders, both in a domestic and wild state,
is the most general and most remarkable variety.
This race of oxen are denominated <HI>bisons;</HI> and,
it has been imagined, till now, that they were of
a different species from the common ox. But,
as we are certain that these animals produce
with the common kind, and that the bunch
diminishes from the first generation, and disap∣pears
in the second or third, it is evident, that
this bunch is only an accidental and variable
character, which prevents not the bunched ox
from belonging to the same species with our ox.
Now, in the desert parts of Europe, there were,
in antient times, wild oxen, some of them with
bunches, and others without bunches. Hence
this variety seems to be natural, and to proceed
from the abundance and more substantial quality
of the food; for we remarked, when treating of
the camels, that, when meagre and ill fed, they
have not even the least vestige of a bunch. The
ox without a bunch was called <HI>vrochs</HI> and <HI>tu∣rochs</HI>
in the language of the Germans, and, in
the same language, the bunched ox was called
<HI>visen.</HI> The Romans, who knew neither of these
wild oxen till they saw them in Germany, a∣dopted
their German names. From <HI>vrochs</HI> they
made <HI>vrus,</HI> and from <HI>visen, bison.</HI> They never
<PB N="158" REF="175"/>
imagined that the wild ox described by Aristotle,
under the name of <HI>bonasus,</HI> could be one or o∣ther
of these oxen whose names they had Lati∣nized.</P>
<P>The length of the hair is another difference
between the aurochs and bison. The neck, the
shoulders, and the throat of the bison, are cover∣ed
with very long hair. But, in the aurochs, all
these parts are covered with short hair, similar to
that on the rest of the body, except the front,
which is covered with crisped hair. This diffe∣rence
of the hair, however, is still more acciden∣tal
than that of the bunch, and depends likewise
on the food and the climate, as we have proved
under the articles Goat, Sheep, Dog, Cat, Rab∣bit,
&amp;c. Thus, neither the bunch, nor the dif∣ference
in the length of the hair, are specific cha∣racters,
but accidental varieties only.</P>
<P>A more extensive variety than the other two
arises from the figure of the horns; to which
character naturalists have ascribed more impor∣tance
than it deserves. They have not consider∣ed,
that, in our domestic cattle, the figure, the
size, the position, the direction, and even the
number of the horns vary so greatly, that it is
impossible to ascertain what is the real model of
Nature. In some cows, the horns are much
crooked, and hang so low as to be almost pendu∣lous;
in others, they are more erect, longer, and
more elevated. There are entire races of ewes
with sometimes two, sometimes four horns; and
<PB N="159" REF="176"/>
there are races of cows without horns. These
external, or, as they may be called, accessory
parts of the body, are as fluctuating as the co∣lours
of the hair, which, in domestic animals,
are varied and combined in every possible man∣ner.
This difference in the figure and direction
of the horns, which is so frequent, ought not,
therefore, to be regarded as a distinctive character
of species. It is, however, the only character
which our naturalists have adopted in their spe∣cies;
and, as Aristotle, in his description of the
bonasus, says, that its horns bended inwards,
they have, from this consideration alone, and
without having ever seen the individual, sepa∣rated
it from the rest, and made it a distinct
species. In this variation of the horns of do∣mestic
animals, we have confined our remarks
to cows and ewes; because the females are al∣ways
more numerous than the males; and we
every where see thirty cows or ewes for one
bull or ram.</P>
<P>The mutilation of animals by castration seems
to injure the individual only, and to have no in∣fluence
on the species. It is certain, however,
that this practice restrains Nature on the one
hand, and weakens her on the other. A single
male, obliged to serve thirty or forty females,
must be enfeebled; besides, the ardour of love
is unequal. It is cool in the male, who exerts
himself beyond the bounds of Nature, and too
ardent in the female, whose enjoyment is limit∣ed
<PB N="160" REF="177"/>
to an instant. Of course, the offspring must
be chiefly tinctured with the feminine qualities;
more females will be produced than males; and
even the males will partake more of the mother
than the father. This is unquestionably the
reason why more girls than boys are brought
forth in those countries where the men have a
great number of wives. On the contrary, in all
countries where the men are allowed but one
wife, more males are produced than females. It
is true, that, in domestic animals, the finest males
are selected to become the fathers of an offspring
so numerous. The first productions from these
males will be strong and vigorous. But, in pro∣portion
to the number of copies taken from the
same mould, the original impression of Nature
will be deformed, or at least rendered less per∣fect.
The race must, therefore, degenerate and
become more feeble. This, perhaps, is the rea∣son
why more monsters are produced among
domestic than wild animals, where the number
of males is equal to that of the females. Besides,
when one male is obliged to serve many females,
they have not the liberty of following their own
taste. They are deprived of that gaiety, and
those soft emotions which proceed from sponta∣neous
pleasures. The fire of their love is half
extinguished; and they languish, waiting for
the cold approaches of a male whom they have
not selected, who is often not accommodated to
them, and who always flatters less than one that
<PB N="161" REF="178"/>
is obliged to caress, in order to obtain a prefe∣rence.
These melancholy and tasteless amours
must give rise to productions equally dismal and
insipid; beings who never have that courage,
spirit, and strength, which Nature can only be∣stow
on each species, by leaving all the indivi∣duals
in full possession of their powers, and, a∣bove
all, of the liberty of choice in the rencoun∣ters
between the sexes. We learn from the ex∣ample
of horses, that crossed races are always the
most beautiful. We ought not, therefore, to
confine our female cattle to a single male of
their own country, who already has too much
resemblance to his mother, and who, conse∣quently,
instead of improving, continues to de∣grade
the species. Man, in this article, prefers
his convenience to every other advantage. We
never think of improving or of embellishing
Nature; but we submit to her operations, that
we may enjoy her in a more arbitrary man∣ner.
The males constitute the glory of each
species. They have more courage, fire, and ob∣stinacy.
A great number of males in our flocks
would render them less tractable, and more diffi∣cult
to manage. In those slaves of the most
abject kind, it is even necessary to depress every
head that offers to exalt itself.</P>
<P>To these causes of degeneration in domestic
animals, we must still add another, which alone
has produced more changes than all the com∣bined
force of the others; I mean, the constant
<PB N="162" REF="179"/>
transportation of those animals from climate to
climate. The ox, the sheep, the goat, have been
carried to every habitable part of the globe.
These species have been subjected to the influ∣ence
of every climate, and have received impres∣sions
from every soil and every sky; so that it
has become extremely difficult, amidst the num∣ber
of changes they have undergone, to recog∣nise
those which are least removed from the pro∣totype
of Nature.</P>
<P>Having pointed out the general causes of the
varieties among domestic animals, I shall now
exhibit the particular proofs of what I advanced
concerning the oxen and buffalos.</P>
<P>1. I remarked, <HI>That the animal we now know
by the name of buffalo, was unknown to the an∣tient
Greeks and Romans.</HI> This position is evi∣dent;
for in none of their authors is there any
description, or even name, which can be applied
to the buffalo. Besides, we learn from the an∣nals
of Italy, that the first buffalo was transport∣ed
thither about the end of the sixth century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann. 595. Voyage de Misson, tom. 3. p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The buffalo, now domestic in Europe, is the
same with the wild or domestic buffalo of India
and Africa.</HI> Of this no other proof is necessary
than a comparison of our description of the buf∣falo,
which was made from the live animal,
with the notices given by travellers of the
buffalos in Persia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 1. pag. 41. et 298.</NOTE>, Mogul<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Relation de The∣venot, page 11.</NOTE>, Bengal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Voyage de l'Hullier, page 30.</NOTE>,
<PB N="163" REF="180"/>
Egypt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. de l'Egypte, par Maillet, tom. 2. pag. 121.</NOTE>, Guiney<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Bosman, pag. 437.</NOTE>, and the Cape of Good
Hope<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Description du cap de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 25.</NOTE>. It is easy to perceive, that, in all
these countries, this animal is the same, and
differs from our buffalo only by very sight varieties.</P>
<P>3. <HI>The bubalus of the Greeks and Latins is
neither the buffalo, nor the small ox of Belon, but
the animal described in the Memoirs of the Aca∣demy
of Sciences, under the name of the Barbary
Cow.</HI> The following facts will prove this po∣sition.
Aristotle<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Genus id fibrarum cervi, damae, bubali sanguini deest; <HI>Arist. Hist. Anim. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE> ranks the bubalus with the stag
and fallow deer, and not with the ox<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bubalis etiam capreisque interdum co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nua inutilia sunt: Nam etsi contra nonnulla resistant, et cornibus se defendant, tamen feroces pugnacesque belluas fugiunt; <HI>Idem, de part, ani∣mal, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 11.</NOTE>. In
another place, he mentions the bubalus along
with the roe deer; and remarks, that he makes
a bad defence with his horns, and that he flies
from all ferocious animals. Pliny<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Germania gignit insignia boum ferorum genera, juba∣tos bisontes excellentique vi et velocitate uros quibus imperi∣tum vulgus <HI>bubalorum</HI> nomen imposuit; cum id gignat Afri∣ca; vituli potius cervive quadam similitudine; <HI>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE>, speaking
of the wild oxen of Germany, says, that it is
only from ignorance that the vulgar give the
<PB N="164" REF="181"/>
name of <HI>bubalus</HI> to these oxen; for the bubalus
is an African animal, which resembles, in some
measure, a calf or a stag. Hence the bubalus is
a timid creature, his horns are useless to him,
and, to avoid the assaults of ferocious animals,
he has no other resource but flight; of course,
he is nimble, and is related, by his figure, both
to the cow and the stag. All these characters,
none of which apply to the buffalo, are com∣bined
in the animal whose figure was sent by Ho∣ratius-Fontana
to Aldrovandus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrov. de quad. bisule. p. 365.</NOTE>, and of which
the Gentlemen of the Academy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour servir à l'hist. des animaux, part. 2. p. 24.</NOTE> have likewise
given a figure and description, under the name
of the <HI>Barbary cow;</HI> and they agree with me in
thinking, that it is the bubalus of the antients<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This animal should rather be regarded as the bubalus of the antients, than the small African ox described by Belon; <HI>Id. ibid. p.</HI> 26.</NOTE>.
The zebu, or small ox of Belon, has none of the
characters of the bubalus; for the zebu differs as
much from the bubalus as the ox from the an∣tilope;
and Belon is the only naturalist who re∣garded
this small ox as the bubalus of the an∣tients.</P>
<P>4. <HI>The small ox of Belon is only a variety of
the common ox.</HI> This may be easily proved by
simply referring to the figure of this animal
given by Belon, Prosper Alpinus, and Edwards,
and to our own description of it. We have seen
it alive: Its conductor told us, that it came from
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
Africa, where it was called <HI>zebu;</HI> that it was do∣mestic, and was used for riding. It is, indeed, a
very mild, and even a caressing animal. Its fi∣gure,
though thick and squat, is agreeable. It
has, however, so perfect a resemblance to the ox,
that I can give no better idea of it, than by re∣marking,
that, if a handsome bull were viewed
through a glass which diminished objects one
half, this contracted figure would be that of the
zebu.</P>
<P>The description I made of this animal, in
the year 1752, is inserted below in the note<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This small ox has a perfect resemblance to that of Belon. Its crupper is round, and plumper than that of the common ox. It is so gentle and familiar, that it licks the hand like a dog, and caresses every person who approaches. It is a very beautiful animal; and its intelligence seems to he equal to its docility. We were informed by its conductor, that it was brought from Africa, and that its age was twenty-one months. Its colour was white, mixed with yellow and a little red. All the legs were white. The hair on the spine of the back, for about a foot wide, is black, and the tail of the same colour. In the middle of this black band, there is on the crupper a small white streak, the hairs of which stand erect like bristles. It had no mane, and there was very little hair on the tuft. The hair of the body is very smooth and short. It was five feet seven inches in length, from the end of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, five feet one inch in circumference behind the fore legs, five feet six inches at the middle of the body, and five feet one inch above the hind legs. The circumference of the head, taken before the horns, was two feet ten inches, and that of the muzzle, taken behind the nostrils, was one foot three inches. The fissure of the mouth, when shut, was eleven inches. The nostrils were two inches long by one broad; and, from the end of the muzzle to the eye measured ten inches. The eyes were distant from each other about six inches; and from their posterior angle, to the aperture of the ears, measured four inches. The ears were situated behind and a little to one side of the horns, and were near seven inches long, and nine inches in circumference at the base. The distance between the horns was little more than four inches; they were one foot two inches in length, six inches in circumference at the base, and, at half an inch from the points, only an inch and a half. They were of the ordinary colour of horn, and black near the extremi∣ties, which were distant from each other one foot seven inches. The bunch, which consisted entirely of flesh, was seven inches in perpendicular height. The colour of the hair which co∣vered it was blackish, and an inch and a half long. The tail, to the end of the vertebrae, was little more than two feet long; but, including the hair, which hangs down to the ground, it was two feet ten inches and a half. The longest hairs of the tail measured one foot three inches. The testicles were a foot and a half distant from the anus. It had four paps, situated like those of the bull.</NOTE>.
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>
It corresponds very well with the figure and de∣scription
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a very small bull; it is thick, fat, smooth, and well shaped.....It was already old, though its body was not so large as that of a stag; but it was more squat, and thicker than a roebuck, and so neat and compact in all its members, that it was extremely agreeable to behold......Its feet resembled those of the ox; and its legs were short and squat. Its neck is thick and short, and the dewlap very small. It has the head of an ox, and the horns rise from a bone on the top of the head. They are black, much notched, like those of the Gazelle, or Barbary antilope, and formed like a crescent.... It has the ears of a cow; its shoulders are plump, and a little elevated; its tail is long, and covered with black hair. It has the appearance of an ox, only it is not so tall.... We have here given a figure of it.—Belon adds, that this small ox was brought to Cairo from Azamia, a province of Asia, and that it is also found in Africa; <HI>Obs. de Belon, fol.</HI> 118.</NOTE> given by Belon, which I have also
<PB N="167" REF="184"/>
inserted, that the reader may have an oportuni∣ty
of comparing them. Prosper Alpinus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prosp. Alpin. Hist. Nat. Aegypt. p. 233.</NOTE>, who
describes this animal, and gives a figure of it,
says that it is found in Egypt. His description
agrees with mine, and also with Belon's. The
only differences between the three are in the co∣lour
of the horns and hair. The zebu of Belon
was yellow on the belly, brown on the back,
and had black horns. That of Prosper Alpinus
was red, marked with small spots, with horns of
the ordinary colour. Ours was of a pale yel∣low,
almost black on the back, with horns of
the same colour as those of a common ox. In
the figures of Belon and Prosper Alpinus, the
bunch on the back is not sufficiently marked.
The opposite error takes place in the figure
which Mr Edwards<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. of Birds, p. 200.</NOTE> has lately given of this
animal, from a drawing communicated to him
by Sir Hans Sloane; for the bunch is too large.
Besides, the figure is incomplete; for it seems to
have been drawn from a very young animal, whose
horns were only beginning to shoot. It came,
says Mr Edwards, from the East Indies, where
these small oxen are used as we do horses. From
all these hints, and likewise from the varieties
in the colour, and the natural mildness of this
animal, it is apparent, that it belongs to the
bunched race of oxen, and has derived its origin
from a domestic state, in which the smallest in∣dividuals
<PB N="168" REF="185"/>
have been chosen for a breed; for, in
general, we find, that the bunched oxen in a
domestic state, like our own domestic kind, are
smaller than those in a wild state. These facts
shall afterwards be fully confirmed by the tes;ti∣monies
of travellers.</P>
<P>5. <HI>The bonasus of Aristotle is the same animal
with the bison of the Latins.</HI> This proposi∣tion
cannot be proved, without a critical discus∣sion,
with which I will not fatigue the reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here it is necessary to compare what Aristotle has said of the bonasus. (<HI>Hist. anim. lib. 9. cap.</HI> 45.) with what he else∣where remarks, (<HI>lib. de Mirabilibus</HI>) and likewise the particu∣lar passages in his <HI>hist. anim. lib 2. c. 1. &amp;</HI> 16. and also to read Gesner's dissertation on this subject; <HI>Hist. qua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p.</HI> 131.</NOTE>.
Gesner, who was a man of literature as well
as a naturalist, and who thought, as I do, that
the bonasus might probably be the bison, has
examined the notices given of the bonasus by
Aristotle with more care than any other person;
he has, at the same time, corrected several er∣roneous
expressions in Theodore Gaza's tran∣slation;
which errors, however, have been ser∣vilely
copied by all the succeeding naturalists.
From these assistances, and by rejecting from
the remarks of Aristotle whatever is obscure,
contradictory, or fabulous, the following seems
to be the result. The bonasus is a wild ox of
Poeonia, and is as large, and of the same figure
with the domestic ox. But his neck, from the
shoulders to the eyes, is covered with long hair,
<PB N="169" REF="186"/>
which is softer than the mane of a horse. He
has the voice of an ox. His horns are short,
and bended down round the ears. His legs are
covered with long hair, as soft as wool; and his
tail is short in proportion to his size, though in
every other respect it is similar to that of the
ox. Like the bull, he has the habit of raising
the dust with his feet. His skin his hard, and
his flesh tender and good. From these charac∣ters,
which are all that can be collected from
the writings of Aristotle, we see how nearly
the bonasus approaches to the bison. Every
article, indeed, corresponds, except the form
of the horns, which, as was formerly remarked,
varies considerably in animals that belong to
the same species. We have seen horns bend∣ed
in the same manner, which were taken from
a bunched ox of Africa; and we shall afterwards
prove, that this bunched ox is nothing but the
bison. What I now advance may likewise be
confirmed by the testimonies of antient authors.
Aristotle calls the bonasus a Poeonian ox;
and Pausanias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pausan. in Beoticis et Phocicis.</NOTE>, speaking of the Poeonian bull,
says, in two different places, that these bulls are
bisons. He likewise tells us, that the Poeonian
bulls, which he saw at the Roman shews, had
very long hair on the breast, and about the
jaws. Lastly, Julius Caesar, Pliny, Pausanias,
Solinus, &amp;c. when speaking of wild oxen, men∣tion
the aurochs and the bison, but take no no∣tice
of the bonasus. We must, therefore, sup∣pose
<PB N="170" REF="187"/>
that, in the course of four or five centu∣ries,
the species of bonasus has been lost, unless
we allow that the terms <HI>bonasus</HI> and <HI>bison</HI> de∣note
only the same animal.</P>
<P>6. <HI>The bison of America might proceed ori∣ginally
from the European bison.</HI> The founda∣tion
of this opinion has already been laid in
our dissertation on the animals peculiar to the
two Continents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 5. of this work.</NOTE>. It was from the experi∣ments
of M. de la Nux that we derived much
information on this subject. From him we
learn, that the bisons, or bunched oxen of India
and Africa, produce with the European bulls
and cows, and that the bunch is only an acci∣dental
character, which diminishes in the first
generation, and totally disappears in the second
or third. Since the Indian bisons are of the
same species with our oxen, and, of course,
have the same origin, is it not natural to extend
this origin to the American bison? In support
of this supposition, every thing seems to concur.
The bison appears to be a native of cold and
temperate regions. His name is derived from
the German language. The antients tell us, that
he was found in that part of Germany which
borders upon Scythia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Paucissima Scythia gignit animalia, inopia fructus, pauca contermina illi Germania, insignia tamen boum ferorum genera, jubatos bisontes; <HI>Plin. Hist. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE>; and there are still bi∣sons in
the northern parts of Germany, in Poland,
<PB N="171" REF="188"/>
and in Scotland. Hence they might pass to A∣merica,
or come from that country, as they are
animals common to both Continents. The on∣ly
difference between the European and Ame∣rican
bisons is, that the latter are smaller. But
even this difference is a farther proof that they
belong to the same species; for it was former∣ly
remarked, that, in general, both the domestic
and wild animals, which have spontaneously
passed, or have been transported into America,
have uniformly diminished in size. Besides,
all the characters, not excepting the bunch and
the long hair on the anterior parts of the body,
are the same in the American and European bi∣sons.
Hence these animals must be regarded
as not only of the same species, but as proceed∣ing
from the same race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several persons of note have reared small oxen and wild cows, which are found in Carolina, and in other countries as far south as Pensylvania. These small oxen are tamed; but they still retain so much of their natural ferocity, that they pierce through every hedge which opposes their passage. Their heads are so strong, that they overturn the palisades of their inclosures, to come at the cultivated fields, where they do much mischief; and, as soon as a passage is opened, they are followed by the whole flock of domestic cattle. These two kinds couple together, and have given rise to an interme∣diate kind; <HI>Voyage de Pierre Kalm, p.</HI> 350.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>7. <HI>The urus, or aurochs, is the same animal
with the common bull in its natural and wild
state.</HI> This position is evident from the figure
of the aurochs, and its whole habit of body,
which are perfectly similar to those of our do∣mestic
<PB N="172" REF="189"/>
bull. The aurochs, like every other a∣nimal
that enjoys liberty, is only larger and
stronger. The aurochs is still found in some
northern provinces: The young aurochs have
sometimes been carried off from their mothers,
and, after being reared to maturity, they pro∣duced
with our domestic bulls and cows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. ant. Schmebergenis, ad Gesnerum, <HI>Hist. quad. p.</HI> 141.</NOTE>.
Hence, those animals must unquestionably be∣long
to the same species.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Lastly, The bison differs from the aurochs
by accidental varieties only; and, consequently,
it is, as well as the aurochs, of the same species
with the domestic ox.</HI> The bunch, the length
and quality of the hair, and the figure of the
horns, are the sole characters by which the bi∣son
can be distinguished from the aurochs. But
we have seen the bunched oxen produce with
the common domestic kind; we likewise know,
that the length and quality of the hair, in all
animals, depend on the nature of the climate;
and we have remarked, that, in the ox, sheep,
and goat, the form of the horns is various and
fluctuating. These differences, therefore, are
by no means sufficient to constitute two distinct
species: And, since our domestic cattle produce
with the bunched Indian oxen, they would like∣wise
undoubtedly produce with the bison or
bunched ox of Europe. Among the almost in∣numerable
varieties of these animals in different
<PB N="173" REF="190"/>
climates, there are two primitive races, both of
which have long continued in a natural state,
the bison or bunched ox, and the aurochs, or
ox without a bunch. These two races have
subsisted either in a wild or domestic state,
and have been diffused, or rather transported by
men into every climate of the globe. All the domestic
oxen without bunches have proceeded
originally from the aurochs, and all the bunch∣ed
oxen have been derived from the bison. To
obtain a just idea of these varieties, we shall
give an enumeration of them as they exist in
different parts of the world.</P>
<P>To begin with the north of Europe, the small
bulls and cows of Iceland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Islandi domestica animalia habent vaccas, sed multae sunt mutilae cornibus; <HI>Dithmar Blefken. Island. pag.</HI> 49.</NOTE>, though they belong
to the same race with our oxen, are deprived of
horns. The magnitude of these animals depends
more on the abundance and quality of their pas∣ture,
than on the nature of the climate. The
Dutch<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">About the month of February, vast numbers of meager cows are brought from Denmark, which the Dutch peasants turn into their meadows. They are much larger than those of France; and each of them yields from eighteen to twenty Paris pints of milk a day; <HI>Voyage hist. de l'Europe, tom. 5. p.</HI> 77.</NOTE> bring meager cattle from Denmark,
which fatten prodigiously in their rich meadows,
and give a great quantity of milk. These Da∣nish
cattle are much larger than ours. The cows
and bulls of the Ukraine, where the pasture is
excellent, are reckoned to be the largest in Eu∣rope
<PB N="174" REF="191"/>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the Ukraine, the pasture is so excellent, that the cattle are much larger than in any other part of Europe. It requires a man above the middling stature to be able to lay his hand on the middle of an ox's back; <HI>Relat, de la Grande Tartarie, p.</HI> 227.</NOTE>, and are of the same race with the com∣mon
kind. In Switzerland, where the tops of the
the first mountains are covered with verdure and
flowers, and are solely destined for the feeding
of cattle, the oxen are nearly double the size of
those in France, where they are common∣ly
fed upon gross herbage, which is despised
by the horses. During winter, bad hay and
leaves are the common food of our oxen; and,
in spring, when they stand in need of being re∣cruited,
they are excluded from the meadows.
Hence they suffer more in spring than in win∣ter;
for they then hardly receive any thing in
the stable, but are conducted into the highways,
into fallow grounds, or into the woods, and are
always kept at a distance from fertile land; so
that they are more fatigued than nourished.
Lastly, in summer, they are permitted to go in∣to
the meadows, which are then eat up, and
parched with drought. During the whole year,
therefore, these animals are never sufficiently
nourished, nor receive food agreeable to their
nature. This is the sole cause which renders
them weak, and of a small size; for, in Spain,
and in some districts of our provinces, where
the pasture is good, and reserved for oxen alone,
they are much larger and stronger.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="192"/>
In Barbary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the kingdom of Tunis and Algiers, the oxen and cows, generally speaking, are not so large as those of England. After being well fattened, the largest of them seldom weigh above five or six hundred pounds. The cows give very little milk, and it commonly dries up when their calves are taken from them; <HI>Shaw's Travels</HI>—Boves domestici, quot∣quot in Africae montibus nascuntur, adeo sunt exigui, ut aliis collati, vituli biennes appareant, monticolae tamen illos aratro exercentes tum robustos, tum laboris patientes asserunt; <HI>Leon. Afric. Africae Descript. tom. 2.pag.</HI> 753.—The cows of Guiney are dry and meager.... Their milk is so poor and scanty, that twenty or thirty of them are hardly sufficient to serve the general's table. These cows are very small and light; one of the best of them, when full grown, weighs not above two hundred and fifty pounds, though, in proportion to its size, it ought to weigh one half more; <HI>Voyage de Bos∣man, p.</HI> 236.</NOTE>, and most parts of Africa, where
the lands are dry, and the pasture poor, the
oxen are still smaller, the cows give much less
milk than ours, and most of them lose their
milk with their calves. The same remark ap∣plies
to some parts of Persia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The people of Caramania, at a little distance from the Persic Gulf, have some goats and cows; but their horned cattle are not stronger than calves, or Spanish bulls of a year old; and their horns exceed not a foot in length; <HI>Ambassade de Silva Figueroa, p.</HI> 62.</NOTE>, of Lower Aethi∣opia
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the province of Guber in Aethiopia, a number of large and small cattle are reared; but their cows are not larger than our heifers; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 3. p.</HI> 66.</NOTE>, and of Great Tartary<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">At Krasnojarsk, the Tartars have a number of cattle; but a Russian cow gives twenty times as much milk as one of theirs; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin à Kamtschatka.</HI></NOTE>; while, in the
same countries, and at no great distances, as in Cal∣muck
<PB N="176" REF="193"/>
Tartary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oxen, in the provinces occupied by the Calmuck Tartars, are still larger than those of the Ukraine, and taller than in any other part of the world; <HI>Relat. de la Grande Tar∣tarie, p.</HI> 228.</NOTE>, in Upper Aethiopia<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Upper Aethiopia, the cows are as large as camels, and without horns; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 3. p.</HI> 157.</NOTE>, and, in

They are used by the Abyssinians for pitchers and bottles; <HI>Voyage d'Abyssinie du P. Lobo, tom. 1. p.</HI> 57.</NOTE>, the oxen are of a prodigious size.
Hence this difference depends more on the quan∣tity
of food than on the temperature of the cli∣mate.
In the northern and temperate, as well
as in the warm regions, we find, at very incon∣siderable
distances, large or small oxen, according
to the quantity and quality of the pasture they
have to feed upon.</P>
<P>The race of aurochs, or of the ox without a
bunch, occupies the frozen and temperate zones,
and is not much diffused over the southern re∣gions.
The race of the bison, or bunched ox,
on the contrary, occupies all the warm climates.
In the whole continent of India<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The oxen which draw coaches in Surat are white, of a good size, and have two bunches like those of certain camels. They run and gallop like horses, and are garnished with splendid housing, and a number of small bells fixed to their necks. When the animals are in motion, the bells are heard at a considerable distance, and their noise in the streets is very agreeable.

There are three kinds, namely, those which have horns, those which have pendu∣lous horns attached to the skin, and those which have no horns, but only a small osseous eminence, in the middle of their front, covered with skin. The last kind fail not, how∣ever, to combat other bulls, by striking their bellies with their heads. They all run like our stags, and have longer legs than those of Europe; <HI>Voyage de Flacourt, p.</HI> 3.—The oxen in the island of Johanna, near the Mosambique coast, differ from ours.

bunches. It even appears that this race,
which is diffused over all the warm countries,
has several advantages over the other; for, like
the bison, from which they have proceeded,
these bunched oxen have softer and more glossy
hair than ours, whose hair, like that of the au∣rochs,
is hard, and thinly spread over the body.
They are likewise swifter, more proper for sup∣plying
the place of the horse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As the oxen in India are perfectly gentle, many people travel on them as we do on horses. Their common pace is soft. Instead of a bit, a small cord is passed through the car∣tilage of their nostrils, which is tied to a larger cord, and serves as a bridle; and this bridle is fixed to the bunch on the fore part of the back, which is wanting in our oxen. They are saddled like horses, and, when pushed, move as briskly. These animals are used in most parts of India; and no other are employed in drawing carts and chariots They are fixed to the end of the beam by a long yoke, which is placed on the necks or the two oxen; and the driver holds the rope to which the cord that passes through the nostrils is tied; <HI>Rela∣tion de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 151.—This Indian Prince was seated on a chariot drawn by two white oxen, with short necks, and bunches on their shoulders; but they were as swift and alert as our horses; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, tom. 1. p.</HI> 458.—The two oxen which were yoked to ray coach coast near 600 roupees.

When one half of the day's journey is finished, each of them is supplied with two or three balls of the size of a penny loaf, made of flour knedded with butter and black sugar; and, at night, their common food is chick-peas bruised; and steeped for half an hour in water; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, p.</HI> 36.—Some of these oxen follow the horses at a smart trot. The smallest are the most nimble. The Gentoos, and parti∣cularly the Banians and merchants of Surat, use these oxen for drawing their carriages.

<PB N="179" REF="196"/>
time, not so stupid and indolent as our oxen.
They are more tractable and intelligent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the country of Camandu in Persia, there are many oxen entirely white, with small blunt horns, and bunches on their backs. They are very strong, and carry heavy burdens. When about to be loaded, they lie down on their knees like the camels, and rise again when the goods are properly fastened. To this practice they are trained by the natives; <HI>Description de l' Inde, par Marc Paul, liv. 1. chap.</HI> 22.—The European labourers prick their oxen with a goad, in order to make them advance. But, in Bengal, their tails are only twisted. These animals are extremely tractable. When loading, they are instructed to lie down, and to rise with the burdens on their backs; <HI>Lett. Edif. recueil. 9. p.</HI> 422.</NOTE>,
and have more of those relative feelings from
which advantage may be derived. They are
likewise treated with more care than our best
horses. The respect the Indians entertain for
<PB N="180" REF="197"/>
these animals is so great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Queen is attended with the ladies of fashion, and the pavement or roads through which she passes are strewed with the dung of the cows formerly mentioned. These peo∣ple have such a veneration for their cows, that they are al∣lowed to enter the King's palace, and are never stopped on their passage, wherever they choose to go. The King and all the nobles give place to these cows, as well as to the bulls and oxen, with every possible mark of respect and veneration; <HI>Voyage de François Pyrard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 449.</NOTE>, that it has degene∣rated
into superstition, which is the ultimate
step of blind veneration. The ox, being the
most useful animal, has appeared to them to
merit the greatest reverence. This venerable
object they have converted into an idol, a kind
of beneficent and powerful divinity; for every
thing we respect must be great, and have the
power of doing much good, or much evil.</P>
<P>These bunched oxen vary perhaps more than
ours in the colour of the hair and the figure
of their horns. The most beautiful are white,
like those of Lombardy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">All the cattle of Italy are gray or white; <HI>Voyage de Burnet, part. 2. p.</HI> 12.—The oxen of India, and especially those of Guzarat and of Cambaya, are generally white like like those of Milan; <HI>Grosse's travels, p.</HI> 253.</NOTE>. Some of them
have no horns; the horns of others are very
high, and in others they are almost pendulous.
It even appears that this first race of bisons, or
bunched oxen, should be divided into two se∣condary
races, the one large, and the other
small, which last comprehends the zebu. Both
<PB N="181" REF="198"/>
are found nearly in the same climates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oxen of India are of different sizes, some large, o∣thers small, and others of a middle size. But, in general, they travel well, some of them making journeys of fifteen leagues a day. Some of them are near six feet high; but these are rare. There is another kind called <HI>dwarfs,</HI> because they exceed not three feet in height. The latter, like the others, have a bunch on their backs, run very fast, and are used for drawing small carts. The white oxen are extremely dear. I have seen two, which belonged to the Dutch, each of which cost two hundred crowns. They were indeed very beautiful and strong; and the chariot in which they were yoked had a magnificent appearance. When the people of fashion have fine oxen, they take great care of them. The tips of their horns are ornamented with copper rings. They are covered with clothes, in the same manner as horses. They are daily curried and fed with great attention; <HI>Relat. d'un voyage par Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 252.</NOTE>, and
are equally gentle and easily managed. Both
have fine hair, and bunches on their backs.
This bunch is only an excrescence, a fleshy
wen, which is equally tender and good to eat
as the tongue of an ox. The bunches of some
oxen weigh from forty to fifty pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At Madagascar, there are oxen whose bunch weighs thirty, forty, fifty, and even sixty pounds; <HI>Voyage à Mada∣gascar, par de V. Paris, p.</HI> 245.</NOTE>,

that they have seen horns which could
contain fifteen and even twenty pints of water.</P>
<P>Throughout all Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Along the coast of Guiney, we see only bulls and cows; for the Negroes understand not the practice of castration; <HI>Voyage de Bosman, p.</HI> 236.</NOTE>, the large cattle are
never castrated; and this operation is not much
practised in India<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the Indians castrate their bulls, it is not by in∣cision, but by the compression of ligatures, which prevents the nourishment of the parts; <HI>Grosse's travels, p.</HI> 253.</NOTE>. When the bulls are castra∣ted,
the testicles are not cut off, but compressed.
Though the Indians keep a great number of
these animals for drawing their carriages and
plowing the ground, they do not rear so many
as we do. As, in all warm countries, the cows
give little milk, as the natives are unacquainted
with butter or cheese, and, as the flesh of the
calves is not so good as in Europe, the inhabitants
do not greatly multiply horned cattle. Besides,
in all the southern provinces of Africa and
Asia, being more thinly peopled than those in
Europe, there are a number of wild oxen,
which are taken when young. They tame
spontaneously, and submit, without resistance, to
all kinds of domestic labour. They become so
tractable, that they are managed with as much ease
as horses: The voice of their master is sufficient
to direct their course, and to make them obey.
They are shod,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As the roads in the province of Asmer are very stony, the oxen are shod before they set out on long journeys. They are thrown on the ground by ropes fixed to their feet. When in this situation, their four feet are placed on a ma∣chine made of two cross sticks. At the same time, two thin, light pieces of iron are applied to each foot, and cover not above one half of the hoof. They are fixed by three nails, above an inch in length, which are rivetted on the opposite side; <HI>Relat. de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 150.</NOTE> curried, caressed, and sup∣plied
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
abundantly with the best food. These a∣nimals,
when managed in this manner, appear to
be different creatures from our oxen, who on∣ly
know us from our bad treatment. The goad,
blows, and hunger, render them stupid, refrac∣tory,
and feeble. If we had a proper know∣ledge
of our own interest, we would treat our
dependents with greater lenity. Men of inferior
condition, and less civilized, seem to have a
better notion than other people of the laws of
equality, and of the different degrees of natu∣ral
equity. The farmer's servant may be said
to be the peer of his master. The horses of the
Arab, and the oxen of the Hottentot, are fa∣vourite
domestics, companions in exercises, as∣sistants
in every labour, and participate the ha∣bitation,
the bed, and the table of their masters.
Man, by this communication, is not so much
degraded as these brutes are exalted and huma∣nized.
They acquire affectionateness, sensibili∣ty,
and intelligence. There they perform e∣very
thing from love which they do here from
fear. They do more; for, as their nature is
improved by the gentleness of their education,
and the perpetual attention bestowed on them,
<PB N="184" REF="203"/>
they become capable of performing actions
which approach to the human powers.
The Hottentots<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hottentots have oxen which they employ successfully in their combats. These animals are called <HI>Backeleys,</HI> from the word <HI>backeley,</HI> which, in the Hottentot language, signi∣fies <HI>war.</HI> In all their armies there are considerable troops of those oxen, which are easily governed, and which are let loose by the chief, when a proper opportunity occurs. They instantly dart with great impetuosity on the enemy. They strike with their horns, kick, overturn, and trample under their feet every thing that opposes their fury. Hence, if not quickly turned back, they run ferociously into the ranks, which they soon put into the utmost disorder, and thus prepare an easy victory for their masters. The manner in which those animals are trained and disciplined, reflects much ho∣nour on the genius and ability of the Hottentots; <HI>Voyage de Cap de Bonne-Esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 1. p.</HI> I60.</NOTE> train their oxen to war, and em∣ploy
them nearly in the same manner as the
Indians employ the elephants. These oxen
are instructed to guard the flocks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These backeleys are likewise of great use in guarding the flocks. When pasturing, at the smallest signal from the keeper, they bring back and collect the wandering animals. They also run with fury upon strangers, which makes them a great security against the attacks of the <HI>buschies,</HI> or robbers of cattle. Every <HI>Kraal</HI> has at least six of these backeleys, which are chosen from among the fiercest oxen. When one of them dies, or becomes unserviceable by age, another is selected from the flock to succeed him. The choice is made by one of the oldest Kraals, who is supposed to distinguish the animal that will be most easily instructed. This noviciate is associated with one of the most exprienced backeleys, and he is taught to follow his companion either by blows, or by other means. In the night, they are tied together by the horns, and are likewise kept in the same situation during part of the day, till the young ox is completely trained to be a vigilant defender of the flock. These brackeleys, or keepers of the flocks, know every inhabitant of the <HI>Kraal,</HI> and show the same marks of respect for all the men, women; and children, as a dog does for those who live in his master's family. Hence, those people may approach their cattle with the utmost safety; for the backeleys never do them the smallest injury. But, if a stranger, and particularly an Eu∣ropean, should use the same freedom, without being ac∣companied with a Hottentot, his life would be in the greatest danger. These backeleys, who pasture all around, would soon run upon him at full gallop, and, if not protected by the shepherds, by fire-arms, or by suddenly climbing a tree, his destruction is inevitable. In vain would he have re∣course to sticks or stones: A backeley is not to be intimidated by such feeble weapons; <HI>Description du Cap de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, part. 1. chap. 20. p.</HI> 307.</NOTE>, which they
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
conduct with dexterity, and defend them from
the attacks of strangers and ferocious ani∣mals.
They are taught to distinguish friends
from enemies, to understand signals, and to o∣bey
their master's voice. Thus the most stupid
of men are the best preceptors to brutes. How
does it happen, that the most enlightened man,
instead of managing his fellow creatures, has
so much difficulty in conducting himself?</P>
<P>Thus the bisons, or bunched oxen, are dif∣fused
over all the southern parts of Africa and
Asia. They vary greatly in size, in colour,
in the figure of the horns, &amp;c. On the con∣trary,
in all the northern regions of these two
quarters of the world, and in the whole of
Europe, including the adjacent islands, as far as
the Azores, there are only oxen without
bunches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oxen of Tercera are the largest and finest in Eu∣rope. Their horns are very large. They are so gentle and tame, that, from a flock consisting of more than a thousand, a single animal, upon its name being called by the proprietor, (for every individual has its peculiar name, like our dogs,) instantly runs to him; <HI>Voyage de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 1. p.</HI> 490.—See also <HI>Le Voyage de Mandelslo, tom. 1. p.</HI> 578.</NOTE>, which derive their origin from
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
the aurochs. And, as the aurochs, which is our
ox in a wild state, is larger and stronger than
the domestic kind, the bison, or wild ox with
a bunch, is likewise stronger and larger than
the Indian domestic ox. He is also sometimes
smaller; but the size depends solely on the quan∣tity
of food. In Malabar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the mountains of Malabar and Canara, there are wild oxen so large that they approach to the stature of the elephant; while the domestic oxen of the same country are small, meager, and short-lived; <HI>Voyage du P. Vincent-Marie, chap.</HI> 12.</NOTE>, Canara, Abyssinia,
and Madagascar, where the meadows are fer∣tile
and spacious, the bisons are of a prodigious
size.
In Africa, and in Arabia Petrea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I saw at Mascati, a town of Arabia Petrea, another species of mountain ox, with glossy hair, as white as that of the ermine. It was so handsomely made, that it rather re∣sembled a stag than an ox. Its legs, indeed, were shorter; but they were fine and nimble. The neck was short. The head and tail resembled those of the common ox, but were better shaped. The horns are black, hard, straight, beautiful, about three or four palms in length, and garnished with rings which seem as if they had been turned in a lath; <HI>Voyage du P. Vin∣cent-Marie, chap.</HI> 12.</NOTE>, where
the ground is dry and sterile, the zebus or bi∣sons
are of a small size.</P>
<P>Oxen without bunches are spread over all A∣merica.
They were successively transported thi∣ther
<PB N="187" REF="206"/>
by the Spaniards and other Europeans.
These oxen have greatly multiplied, but have
become smaller in these new lands. This species
was absolutely unknown in South America. But,
in all the northern regions, as far as Florida,
Louisiana, and even in the neighbourhood of
Mexico, the bisons, or bunched oxen, were found
in great numbers. These bisons, which former∣ly
inhabited the woods of Germany, of Scotland,
and other northern countries, have probably
passed from the Old to the New Continent. Like
all the other animals, their size has diminished
in America; and, according as they lived in
climates more or less cold, their hair became
longer or shorter. In Hudson's Bay, their beard
and hair are longer and more bushy than in
Mexico; and, in general, their hair is softer than
the finest wool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The wild oxen of Louisiana, instead of hair, are covered with wool as fine as silk, and all curled. It is longer in win∣ter than in summer, and is much used by the inhabitants. On their shoulders, they have a pretty high bunch. Their horns are very fine, and are used by the hunters for carrying their powder. Between the horns, and toward the top of the head, there is a tuft of hair so thick, that a pistol bullet, though discharged ever so near, cannot penetrate it. I tried the ex∣periment myself. The flesh of these oxen is excellent, as well as that of the cow and calf; its flavour and juice are exqui∣site; <HI>Mem. sur la Louisiane, par M. Dumont, p.</HI> 75.</NOTE>. We cannot hesitate in pro∣nouncing
these bisons of the New Continent to
be the same species with those of the Old. They
have preserved all the principal characters, as

the muzzle and on the anterior parts of the body,

that they are not animals of different
species.</P>
<P>Thus the wild and domestic ox of Europe,
Asia, Africa, and America, the bonasus, the au∣rochs,
the bison, and the zebu, are animals of
the same species, which, according to the differ∣ences
of climate, of food, and of treatment, have
undergone the various changes above described.
The ox is not only the most useful animal, but
most generally diffused; for it has been found
every where, except in South America<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The bunched ox, or wild bison, appears to have inha∣bited only the northern parts of America, as Virginia, Flo∣rida, the country of the Illionois, Louisiana, &amp;c.; for, though Hernandez calls it the <HI>Mexican bull,</HI> we learn from a passage of Antonio de Solis, that this animal was a stranger in Mexi∣co, and that it was kept in the menagerie of Montezuma with other wild beasts which were brought from New Spain. “In a second court, we saw all the wild beasts of New Spain. They were kept in strong wooden cages. But nothing sur∣prised us so much as the appearance of the Mexican bull, which is a rare animal, and has the camel's bunch on its shoulders, the narrow and meager flank of the lion, a bushy tail and mane, and the horns and cloven foot of the bull..... This kind of amphitheatre appeared to the Spa∣niards worthy of a great Prince;” <HI>Hist. de la conquête du Mexique, par Antonio de Solis, p.</HI> 519.</NOTE>. Its
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
constitution is equally adapted to the ardours of
the South, and the rigours of the North. It
appears to be very antient in all climates. It is
domestic in civilized nations, and wild in desert
countries, or among unpolished people. From
its own resources, it supports itself in a state of
nature, and never loses those qualities which
render it serviceable to man. The young wild
calves which are carried off from their mothers
in India and Africa, soon become as gentle as
those of the domestic race. This conformity in
natural dispositions is a still farther proof of the
identity of the species. Mildness of character in
these animals indicates a physical flexibility in
the form of their bodies; for in every species,
whose dispositions are gentle, and who have been
subjected to a domestic state, there are more va∣rieties
than in those who, from an inflexibility
of temper, have remained savage.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="209"/>
If it be asked, whether the aurochs or the
bison be the primitive race of oxen, a satisfactory
answer may be obtained by drawing conclusions
from the facts already related. The bunch of
the bison, as formerly remarked, is only an ac∣cidental
character, which is effaced by the com∣mixture
of the two races. The aurochs, or ox
without a bunch, is, therefore, the most power∣ful
and predominant race. Were it otherwise,
the bunch, instead of disappearing, would extend,
and subsist in all the individuals proceeding from
a mixture of the two races. Besides, this bunch
of the bison, like that of the camel, is not so
much a production of nature, as an effect of la∣bour,
and a badge of slavery. In all ages, and
in every country, the oxen have been obliged to
carry burdens. Their backs, by constant and
often excessive loads, have been deformed; and
this deformity was afterwards transmitted by ge∣neration.
There remained no oxen without this
deformity, except in those countries where
they were not employed in carrying burdens.
Throughout all Africa and the East, the oxen
are bunched; because, at all periods, they have
carried loads on their shoulders. In Europe,
where they are only employed in the draught,
they have not undergone this deformed change,
which is probably occasioned, in the first place,
by the compression of the loads, and, in the se∣cond,
by a redundance of nourishment; for it
disappears when the animal is meager and ill
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
fed. Domestic oxen with bunches might escape,
or be abandoned in the woods, where their po∣sterity
would inherit the same deformity, which,
instead of disappearing, would augment by the
abundance of food peculiar to all uncultivated
countries; so that this secondary race would
spread over all the desert lands of the North and
South, and pass, like the other animals which
can support the rigours of cold, into the New
Continent. The identity of the species of the
bison and aurochs is still farther confirmed from
this circumstance, that the bisons of North Ame∣rica
have so strong an odour of musk, that they
have been called <HI>musk oxen</HI> by most travellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fifteen leagues from the river Danoise, is the river call∣ed <HI>Sea-wolf,</HI> both in the neighbourhood of Hudson's bay. In this country, there is a species of ox called the <HI>Musk ox,</HI> from his strong odour of musk, which, in certain seasons, renders his flesh uneatable. These animals have very fine wool, which is longer than that of the Barbary sheep. I had some of it sent me to France in the year 1708, of which I made stockings, which were as fine as those of silk..... These oxen, though smaller than ours, have larger and longer horns. Their roots join on the top of the head, and descend on the side of the eyes as low as the throat; then the tips mount up in the form of a crescent. I have seen two of them which weighed together sixty pounds. Their legs are so short, that the wool always trails on the ground where they walk, which renders them so unshapely, that it is difficult, at a di∣stance, to know at which end the head is placed; <HI>Hist. de la Nouvelle France, par le P. Charlevoix, tom. 3. p.</HI> 132.—See also <HI>Le Voyage de Robert Lade, tom. 2. p.</HI> 315.</NOTE>;
and, at the same time, we learn, from the testi∣mony
of spectators<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephem. German. decad, 2. ann. 2. observ. 7.</NOTE>, that the aurochs, or wild
<PB N="192" REF="211"/>
ox of Prussia and Livonia, has the same scent of
musk.</P>
<P>Of all the names, therefore, prefixed to this
article, which, both by antient and modern na∣turalists,
are represented as so many distinct spe∣cies,
there remain only the buffalo and the ox.
These two animals, though very similar, both
domestic, often living under the same roof, and
fed in the same pastures, though at liberty to in∣termix,
and frequently stimulated to it by their
keepers, have uniformly refused to unite. They
neither copulate nor produce together. Their
natures are more remote from each other than
that of the ass and horse: They even seem to
have a mutual antipathy; for we are assured,
that cows will not suckle young buffaloes, and
that female buffaloes refuse to suckle calves. The
disposition of the buffalo is more obstinate and
untractable than that of the ox. He is less obe∣dient,
more violent, and subject to humours more
frequent and more impetuous. All his habits
are gross and brutal. Next to the hog, he is the
dirtiest of domestic animals; for nothing is more
difficult than to dress and keep him clean. His
figure is gross and forbidding. His aspect is
wild and stupid. He stretches out his neck in
an aukward, ignoble manner, and carries his
head so ungracefully, that it generally hangs
down toward the ground. He bellows hideous∣ly,
and with a stronger and deeper tone than
that of the bull. He has meager limbs, a naked
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
tail, a dark countenance, and a skin as black as
his hair. He differs chiefly from the ox by this
black colour of his skin: It appears under the
hair, which is not close. His body is thicker and
shorter than that of the ox, his legs longer, his
head proportionally smaller, his horns less round,
being black and compressed; and he has a tuft
of curled hair on his front. His skin is also
thicker and harder than that of the ox. His
flesh is black and hard, and has not only a bad
taste, but a most disagreeable odour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In travelling from Rome to Naples, we are sometimes regaled with crows and buffaloes, and are happy to find them. The flesh of the buffalo is black, hard, and stinking, and none but poor people and the Jews of Rome are in the habit of eating it; <HI>Voyage de Misson, tom. 3. p.</HI> 54.</NOTE>. The milk
of the female buffalo is not so good as that of
the cow; but she yields a much greater quanti∣ty
of it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In entering Persia, by the way of Armenia, the first place worthy of notice is called the <HI>Three Churches,</HI> at the distance of three leagues from Erivan. In this country, there are vast numbers of buffaloes, which serve the inhabitants for plough∣ing their lands. The females yield a great quantity of milk, of which butter and cheese are made. Some females give daily twenty-two pints of milk; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, liv. 1. tom. 1. p.</HI> 41.—The female buffaloes go with young twelve months, and often give twenty-two pints of milk a-day, of which so great quantities of butter are made, that, in some of the villages on the Tigris, we saw from twenty to twenty-five barks loaded with butter, to be sold along both sides of the Persic Gulf; <HI>Id. ib.</HI></NOTE>. In warm countries, most cheeses are
made of the buffalo's milk. The flesh of young
buffaloes, though fed with milk, is not good.
The skin is of more value than the rest of
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
the animal, the tongue of which is alone good
for eating. The skin is solid, pretty flexible,
and almost impenetrable. As these animals are
larger and stronger than oxen, they are employ∣ed
with advantage in different kinds of labour.
They are made to draw, and not to carry bur∣dens.
They are directed and restrained by means
of a ring passed through their nose. Two buf∣faloes
yoked, or rather chained, to a chariot,
draw as much as four strong horses. As they
carry their neck and head low, the whole weight
of their body is employed in drawing; and their
mass much surpasses that of a labouring horse.</P>
<P>The height and thickness of the buffalo are
sufficient indications that he originated from
warm climates. The largest quadrupeds are
produced in the Torrid Zone of the Old Conti∣nent;
and the buffalo, in the order of magnitude,
should be ranked next to the elephant, the rhi∣noceros,
and the hippopotamus. The camelo∣pard
and the camel are taller, but thinner; and
the whole are equally natives of the southern
regions of Asia and Africa. Buffaloes, however,
live and produce in Italy, in France, and in o∣ther
temperate countries. Those kept in the
royal menagerie have produced twice or thrice.
The female brings forth but one at a birth, and
goes with young about twelve months; which
is a still farther proof of the difference of this
species from that of the cow, whose time of
gestation is only nine months. It appears, like∣wise,
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
that these animals are more gentle and less
brutal in their native country; and that, the
warmer the country, their disposition is more
docile. In Egypt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The buffaloes are numerous in Egypt. Their flesh is good; and they are not so ferocious as those of Europe. Their milk is of great use, and produces excellent butter; <HI>Descript. l'Egypte, par Maillet, p.</HI> 27.</NOTE>, they are more tractable
than in Italy, and in India<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the kingdom of Aunan and Tonquin, the buffaloes are very tall, and have high shoulders. They are also robust, and such excellent labourers, that one alone is sufficient to draw a plough, though the coulter enters very deep into the ground. Their flesh is not disagreeable; but that of the ox is better, and more commonly used; <HI>Hist. de Tonquin, par le P. de Rhodes, p.</HI> 51.</NOTE> than in Egypt.
The Italian buffaloes have also more hair than
those of Egypt, and the Egyptian than those
of India<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">At Malabar, the buffalo is larger than the ox. He is shaped nearly in the same manner. His head is longer and flatter. His eyes are larger, and almost entirely white. His horns are flat, and often two feet long. His legs are thick and short. He is uggly, and almost without hair. He walks slowly, and carries heavy burdens. Like the cows, they go in flocks; and their milk produces butter and cheese. Their flesh is good, though less delicate than that of the ox. They are excellent swimmers, and traverse the most rapid rivers. We have seen them tamed. But the wild buffaloes are ex∣tremely dangerous; for they tear men to pieces, or crush them with a single stroke of their heads. They are less to be feared in the woods than in any other situation; for their horns often entangle among the branches, which gives those time to fly who are pursued. The skin of these animals is used for a number of purposes; and even pitchers are made of it to keep water and other liquors. Those on the Malabar coast are almost all wild; and strangers are not prohibited from hunting and eating them; <HI>Voyage de Dellon, p.</HI> 110.</NOTE>. Their fur is by no means close;
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
because they belong to warm climates; and the
large animals, in general, of these countries, have
little or no hair.</P>
<P>In Africa and India, there are vast quantities
of wild buffaloes, which frequent the banks of
rivers and extensive meadows. These wild
buffaloes go in flocks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are such numbers of wild buffaloes in the Philip∣pine isles, that a good hunter, with a horse and a spear, may kill thirty of them in a day. The Spaniards kill the buffalo for his skin, and the Indians for his flesh; <HI>Voyage de Gemelli Careri, tom. 5. p.</HI> 162.</NOTE>, and make great havock
in the cultivated fields. But they never attack
men, unless when they are wounded. They
are then extremely dangerous<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We are told by the Negroes, that, when they shoot at the buffaloes, without wounding them mortally, they dart with fury on the hunters, and trample them to death.....The Negroes watch where the buffaloes assemble in the evening, climb a large tree, from which they fire upon them, and de∣scend not till the animals are dead; <HI>Voyage de Bosman, p.</HI> 437.</NOTE>; for they run
straight upon the enemy, overturn him, and
trample him under their feet. They are, how∣ever,
afraid at the sight of fire<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">At the Cape of Good Hope, the buffaloes are larger than those of Europe. lnstead of being black, like the latter, they are of a dark red colour. Upon the front, there is a rude tuft of curled hair. Their whole body is well propor∣tioned; and they advance their head very much forward. Their horns are very short, and hang down on the side of their neck; the tips bend inward, and nearly join. Their skin is so hard and firm, that it is difficult to kill them with-out a good firelock. Their flesh is neither so fat nor so tender as that of ordinary oxen. The buffalo, at the Cape, turns furious at the sight of a red gar-ment, or upon hearing a gun discharged near him. On these occasions, he cries in a hide∣ous manner, strikes with his feet, turns up the earth, and runs with fury against the man who has shot, or wears a red gar∣ment. Neither fire nor water can stop his course. Nothing but a high wall, or some similar obstacle, is capable of re∣straining him; <HI>Descript. de Bonne-esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. chap. 11. p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>, and they ab∣hor
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
a red colour. We are assured by Aldrovan∣dus,
and several other naturalists and travellers,
that no person dare clothe himself in red, in
countries frequented by the buffalo. I know
not whether this aversion to fire and a red colour
be general among the buffaloes; for it is only
some of our oxen which are enraged at the
sight of red clothes.</P>
<P>The buffalo, like all the large animals of warm
climates, is fond of wallowing, and even of re∣maining
in the water. He swims well, and
boldly crosses the most rapid rivers. As his legs
are longer than those of the ox, he runs more
swiftly. The Negroes of Guiney, and the In∣dians
of Malabar, where the buffaloes are very
numerous, are fond of hunting them. They
never attack these animals openly, but watch
for them on the tops of trees, or lie hid in the
thickets through which the buffaloes cannot pass
on account of their horns. These people esteem
the flesh of the buffalo, and draw great profits
from his skin and horns, which are harder and
better than those of the ox.</P>
<P>The animal called <HI>empacassa</HI> or <HI>pacassa</HI> at Con∣go, though very imperfectly described by travel∣lers,
<PB N="198" REF="217"/>
appears to me to be the buffalo; and the a∣nimal
mentioned under the name of <HI>empabunga</HI>
or <HI>impalunca,</HI> in the same country, is, perhaps,
the bubalus, whose history shall be given along
with that of the gazelles or antelopes.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The ox and bison are two distinct races of the
same species. Though the bison uniformly dif∣fers
from the ox by the bunch on his back, and
the length of his hair, he succeeds very well in
the Isle of France: His flesh is much better than
that of the European oxen; and, after some ge∣nerations,
his bunch vanishes entirely. His hair
is smoother, his limbs are more slender, and his
horns longer than those of the common ox. I
saw, says M. de Querhoënt, bisons brought from
Madagascar, which were of an astonishing
size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. le Vicomte de Querhoënt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bison, of which we here give a figure,
and which we saw alive, was taken, when young,
in the forests of the temperate parts of North
America. It was brought to Holland, and
purchased by a Swede, who transported it from
town to town in a large cage, where it was firm∣ly
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
fixed by the head with four ropes. The e∣normous
mane which surrounds its head is not
hair, but a flowing wool, divided into locks, like
an old fleece. This wool is very fine, as well as
that which covers the bunch, and the anterior
part of the body. The parts which appear naked
in the engraving, are only so at a certain time
of the year, which is rather in summer than in
winter; for, in the month of January, all parts
of the body were almost equally covered with
a fine, close, frizzled wool, under which the
skin was of a sooty colour; but, on the bunch,
and all the other parts which are covered with
longer wool, the skin is tawny. This bunch,
which consists entirely of flesh, varies according
to the plight of the animal. To us he appeared
to differ from the European only by the bunch
and the wool. Though under much restraint,
he was not ferocious, but allowed his keepers to
touch and caress him.</P>
<P>It would appear, that there were formerly bi∣sons
in the north of Europe. Gesner even as∣serts,
that, in his time, they existed in Scotland.
Having inquired into this fact, I was informed,
by letters both from Scotland and England, that
no remembrance or vestige of them could be
traced in that country. Mr Bell, in his travels
from Russia to China, mentions two species of
oxen which he saw in the northern parts of Asia;
one of which was the aurochs, or wild ox, and is
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
the same race with our oxen; and the other,
which we have denominated, after Gmelin, the
<HI>Tartarian,</HI> or <HI>Grunting Cow,</HI> appeared to be the
same species with the bison. After comparing
this grunting cow with the bison, I found an
exact coincidence in all the characters, except the
grunting instead of bellowing. But I appre∣hend,
that this grunting is not constant and ge∣neral,
but contingent and particular, similar to
the deep interrupted voice of our bulls, which
is never fully exhibited but in the season of love.
Besides, I was informed, that the voice of the
bison, whose figure I have represented, was never
heard, and that, though considerably hurt, it did
not complain, which induced its master to think
that it was mute: And it is probable, that its voice
would be developed by grunting or interrupted
sounds, when, in full possession of freedom and
in presence of a female, the animal's spirits were
excited by love.</P>
<P>It is singular, that the bisons, or bunched oxen,
whose race appears to be extended, in the Old
Continent, from Madagascar and the point of
Africa, and from the extremity of the East In∣dies
as far as Siberia, and that, in the new Con∣tinent,
though they are found from the country
of the Ilionois to Louisiana, and even Mexico,
they should never have passed the Isthmus of Pa∣nama;
for there are no bisons in any part of
South America, though the climate is perfectly
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
agreeable to their nature, and the European oxen
have multiplied there as well as in any other
part of the globe.</P>
<P>At Madagascar, the best kind of bulls and cows
were brought thither from Africa, and have a
bunch on their backs. The cows yield so little
milk, that a single Dutch cow would give six
times as much. In this island, there are wild
bisons which wander in the forests. The flesh
of these bisons is not equal to that of our oxen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de François le Guat, tom. 2. p. 71.</NOTE>. In the southern parts of Asia, we likewise find wild oxen. The natives of Agra hunt these animals on the mountain of Nerwer, which is surrounded with wood. This mountain is si∣tuated on the road from Surat to Golconda. These wild cattle are generally beautiful, and sell very dear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 3. p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The zebu seems to be a miniature of the bi∣son,
whose race, as well as that of the ox, has
undergone great variations, especially in size.
The zebu, though an original native of very
warm regions, is capable of existing and multi∣plying
in temperate climates. “I saw,” says Mr
Colinson, “a great number of these animals in
the Duke of Richmond's, and also in the Duke
of Portland's parks, where they every year
bring forth calves, which are extremely beau∣tiful.
The fathers and mothers were brought
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
from the East Indies. The bunch on the
shoulder is twice as large in the male as in the
female, whose stature exceeds that of the male.
The young zebu sucks its mother like other
calves; but, in our climate, the milk of the
mother soon dries up, and the suckling of the
young is completed by the milk of another
female. The Duke of Richmond ordered one
of these animals to be slain; but its flesh was
not so good as that of the ox<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the late Mr. Colinson to M. de Buffon, dated at London, December 30. 1764.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Among the oxen without bunches, there are
also small individuals, which, like the zebu, may
constitute a particular race. Gemelli Careri, in
his journey from Ispahan to Schiras, saw two
small cows, which the Bashaw of the province
had sent to the King, and which exceeded not
the size of calves. Though fed solely on straw,
they were very fat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Gemelli Careri, tom. 2, p. 338.</NOTE>. In general, it appears, that
the zebus, or small bisons, as well as our little
oxen, are more fleshy and fatter than the bisons
and oxen of the common size.</P>
<P>With regard to the buffaloes, we have little to
add. It shall only be remarked, that, though
they cannot use their horns, they are made to
fight lions and tigers in the Mogul's country.
These animals are very numerous in all warm
climates, especially in marshy countries, and in
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
the neighbourhood of rivers. Water, and a
moist soil, seem to be still more necessary to them
than the warmth of the climate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I formerly remarked, that the buffaloes might succeed in France. Attempts have lately been made to propagate them in Brandenbourg, near Berlin; <HI>Gazette de France, June</HI> 9. 1775.</NOTE>. It is for this
reason that none of them are found in Arabia,
where almost the whole country is dry. The
wild buffaloes are hunted, but with much cau∣tion;
for they are exceedingly dangerous, and,
when wounded, run against men with great
fury. As to the domestic buffaloes, Niebuhr re∣marks,
that, in some places, as at Basra, it is the
practice, when milking the female, to thrust the
hand, as far as the elbow, into the vagina, be∣cause
this operation makes her yield a greater
quantity of milk<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Descript. de l'Arabie, par M. Niebuhr, p. 145.</NOTE>. This fact appears not to be
probable; but the female buffalo, like some of
our cows, may forcibly retain her milk; and this
gentle kind of titillation may relax the contrac∣tion
of her teats.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope, the body of the
buffalo is of the same size with our ox; but he
has shorter legs, and a larger head. He is a
very formidable animal. He frequents the bor∣ders
of the woods, and, as his sight is not good,
he remains there with his head placed near the
ground, in order the better to distinguish objects
among the roots of the trees. When he per∣ceives
<PB N="204" REF="223"/>
any disagreeable object near him, he
darts suddenly upon it, making, at the same
time, a most hideous bellowing; and it is very
difficult, on these occasions, to escape his fury.
He is not so much to be dreaded in the open
fields. His hair is red, and black in some places.
They appear often in numerous flocks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by the Vicomte de Querhoënt to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE weakest species of useful animals were
first reduced to a domestic state. The
sheep and goat were subjugated before the horse,
<PB N="206" REF="229"/>
the ox, or the camel. They were likewise more
easily transported from one climate to another.
From this source, all the varieties among these
species, as well as the difficulty of distinguishing
the genuine stock of each, have proceeded. We
formerly proved, that our domestic sheep, in
their present condition, could not subsist with∣out
the support of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, article <HI>Sheep,</HI> vol. III.</NOTE>; from which it is ap∣parent,
that Nature never produced them as
they exist at present, but that they have dege∣nerated
under our care. We must, therefore,
search among the wild animals for those which
make the nearest approach to them. We must
compare them with the domestic sheep of foreign
countries, examine the different causes which
<PB N="207" REF="230"/>
might introduce changes into the species, or
make it degenerate, and endeavour, as in the
case of the ox, to recall all these varieties, and
all these pretended species, to one primitive
race.</P>
<P>Our sheep, in its present state, exists no where
but in Europe, and some of the temperate pro∣vinces
of Asia. When transported into warm
countries, as Guiney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ovis Africana pro vellere lanoso pilis brevibus hirtis ves∣tita; hoc genus vidimus in vivario regio West, monasteriensi S.

Ovington, tom. 1. p.</HI> 60.—The sheep are pretty numerous along the coast of Guiney, and yet they are very dear. They have the same figure with those of Europe, except that they are one half smaller, and, instead of wool, are covered with hair of an inch long.… The flesh has not the smallest appearance of that of the European sheep, being extremely dry, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de Bosman, p.</HI> 237.</NOTE>, it loses its wool, and is

hard thick wool, under which, as in most nor∣thern

It is domestic, like the other kind, and subject
to the same varieties. We have given figures
of two of these sheep, which, though they dif∣fer
in particular characters, have so many re∣semblances,
<PB N="213" REF="236"/>
that we must pronounce them to
belong to the same race. Of all the domestic
kinds, this race appears to approach nearest to a
state of nature. It is larger, stronger, nimbler,
and, consequently, more capable of subsisting as
a wild animal. But, as it is only found in very
warm climates, and cannot endure cold, and
as, even in its native climate, it subsists not in a
wild state, but is domestic, and requires the aid
of man, it cannot be regarded as the primitive
stock from which all other sheep have derived
their origin.</P>
<P>In considering domestic sheep, therefore, relative
to the order of climate, we have, 1. The northern
sheep with several horns, and whose wool is
extremely coarse. The sheep of Iceland, Goth∣land,
Muscovy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Twenty Silesian shepherds arrived at Petersburg, and were afterwards sent to Cazan to shear the sheep, and to teach the Muscovites the mode of preparing wool.—But this did not succeed; and the chief cause of its failure was said to be owing to the coarseness of the wool, the sheep and goats having always intermixed and produced together; <HI>Nouv. Mem. sur. l'état de la Moscovie, tom 1. p.</HI> 290.</NOTE>, and other parts of the north
of Europe, have all coarse hair, and seem to be∣long
to the same race.</P>
<P>2. Our sheep, whose wool is very fine and
beautiful in the mild climates of Spain and Per∣sia,
but which, in very warm countries, turns
coarse. We have already remarked the con∣formity
between the influence. of the climates
of Spain and of Chorazan, a province of Persia,
<PB N="214" REF="237"/>
upon the hair of goats, cats, and rabbits: It
acts in the same manner upon the wool of sheep,
which is very fine in Spain, and still finer in
that part of Persia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Meschet in the country of Chorazan, on the fron∣tiers of Persia, lamb skins formerly constituted a great article of commerce. The fleeces were of a beautiful silver gray colour, all curled, and finer than silk: Those sheep which come from the mountains to the south of this city, and from the province of Kerman, afford the finest wool in Persia; <HI>Re∣lation de la Grande Tartarie, p.</HI> 187.—The greatest part of this fine wool is furnished by the province of Kerman, which is the antient Caramania; and the best kind comes from the mountains adjacent to the town, which has the same name with the province. It is singular, that, when the sheep of these places have eat the new herbage from January to May, the fleeces fall entirely off, and leave the animal as bare as scalded pigs; so that there is no occasion for shearing them as in France. When the fleeces are collected, they are beat or threshed; by which operation the coarser part sepa∣rates, and leaves nothing but the fine.—This wool is ne∣ver dyed: It is naturally of a bright brown of a gray ash-co∣lour, and very little of it is white; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 1. p.</HI> 130.—The wedders of the Usbeck and Beschac Tar∣tars have long, grayish wool, curled at the ends into small white rings, which have the appearance of pearls. These fleeces are more esteemed than the flesh; because, next to the sable, they are the most valuable furs which are used in Per∣sia. The animals are fed with great care, and generally in the shade. When obliged to be exposed to the open air, they are covered like our horses. The tail of these wedders is small like that of the common kind; <HI>Voyage d'Olearius, tom. 1. p.</HI> 547.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. The large tailed sheep, whose wool is very fine
in temperate countries, such as Persia, Syria,
and Egypt; but, in warmer climates, it is con∣verted
into hair more or less coarse.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="238"/>
4. The Strepsicheros or Cretan sheep. They
resemble ours in every article but the horns,
which are erect and chamfered in a spiral form.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>adimain,</HI> or large sheep of Senegal
and India, which are covered with hair more or
less short and coarse, in proportion to the heat of
the climate. All these sheep are only varieties
of the same species, and would unquestionably
produce with each other; since we know from
experience that the he-goat, whose species is
more remote, produces with our ewes. But,
though these five or six races of domestic sheep
are all varieties of the same species, entirely
occasioned by difference of climate, food, and
management; yet none of them appears to be
the primitive stock or source of all the rest.
None of them is sufficiently strong or nimble to
resist the carnivorous animals, or to escape from
them by flight. All of them equally require care
and protection. Hence the whole should be re∣garded
as degenerated races, formed by the hand
of man, and multiplied for his use. While he
nourished, cultivated, and increased these dome∣stic
races, he would neglect, injure, and destroy
the wild race, which, being strong and less trac∣table,
would, of course, be more incommodious
and less useful to him. The individuals of this
race, therefore, would be small, and limited to such
desert or thinly inhabited places as could afford
them subsistence. Now, in the mountains of
Greece, in the island of Cyprus, Sardinia, and
Corsica, and in the deserts of Tartary, we find
<PB N="216" REF="239"/>
the animal called <HI>mouflon,</HI> which seems to be the
primitive stock of all the different varieties of
sheep. It lives in a state of nature, and subsists
and multiplies without the aid of man. It re∣sembles,
more than any other wild animal, all
the domestic kinds, and it is stronger, swifter,
and more vivacious than any of them. It has
the head, front, eyes, and face of the ram. It
likewise resembles him in the figure of the horns,
and in the whole habit of the body. In fine,
it produces with the domestic sheep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Est et in Hispania, sed maxime Corsica, non maxime ab∣simile pecori (scilicet ovili) genus musmonum, caprino villo, quam pecoris velleri propius: Quorum e genere et ovibus natos prisci umbros vocarunt; <HI>Plin. Hist. nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 49. From this passage we learn, that the mouflon has at all times produced with the sheep. The antients called all the mongrel animals of this race, <HI>umbri, imbri,</HI> or <HI>ibri.</HI></NOTE>, which a∣lone
is sufficient to prove that it belongs to the
same species, and is the primitive stock from
which all the other varieties have originated.
The only difference between the mouflon and
our sheep is, that the former is covered with
hair instead of wool. Now, we have already
seen, that, in domestic sheep, wool is not an es∣sential
character, but only a production of tem∣perate
climates; since, in warm countries, these
same sheep lose their wool, and are covered with
hair; and, in very cold regions, their wool is as
coarse as hair. Hence it is by no means sur∣prising,
that the primitive wild sheep, which
must have been exposed to heat and cold, and
<PB N="217" REF="240"/>
must have multiplied without shelter in the
woods and deserts, should not be covered with
wool, which it would soon lose among the thickets,
and its nature would be changed by the conti∣nual
action of the air and intemperance of the
seasons. Besides, when the he-goat copulates
with the domestic ewe, the produce is a kind of
mouflon; for the lamb is covered with hair, and
is not an unfertile mule, but a mongrel, which
rises up toward the primitive species, and seems
to indicate that the goat and our domestic sheep
have something common in their origin: And,
as we know from experience, that the he-goat
easily produces with the ewe, but that the ram
is incapable of impregnating the she-goat, it is
evident, that, among these animals, while in a do∣mestic
state, the goat, is the predominant species.
Thus our sheep is a species much more degenerated
than that of the goat; and it is extremely probable,
that, if the she-goat were served with a mouflon,
instead of a domestic ram, she would produce
kids which would approach to the species of
the goat, as the lambs produced by the he-goat
and ewe rise toward the original species of the
ram.</P>
<P>I am aware of objections to this doctrine from
those systematic naturalists, who found all their
knowledge of natural history upon some particular
characters; and, therefore, shall endeavour to pre∣vent
them. The first character, they will say, of
the ram, is to carry wool, and the first character of
<PB N="218" REF="241"/>
the goat is to be covered with hair. The second
character of the ram is to have horns bended in
a circular form, and turned backward, and that
of the he-goat is to have them straight and e∣rect.
These, they will affirm, are the essential
and infallible marks by which sheep and goats
will always be distinguished; for they must ac∣knowledge,
that every other article is common
to both. None of them have cutting teeth in the
upper jaw; but each of them has eight in the
under jaw. In both, the canine teeth are wanting;
their hoofs are equally divided, and their horns
are simple and permanent. Both have their paps
situated in the region of the belly; and both
feed upon herbage. Their internal structure is
still more similar; for it appears to be the very
same. The number and form of their stomachs,
the structure and disposition of their intestines,
the substance of the flesh, the qualities of the fat
and seminal liquor, the times of gestation and
growth, and the duration of their lives, are ex∣actly
the same. There remain, therefore, only the
wool and the horns by which these two species
can be distinguished. But, it has already been
shown, from facts, that wool is not so much a
natural substance, as a production of climate,
aided by the care of man. The sheep of warm
and of cold countries, and wild sheep, have no
wool. Besides, in very mild climates, the goats
may be said to have wool instead of hair;
for that of the Angora goat is finer than the
<PB N="219" REF="242"/>
wool of our wedders. This character, there∣fore,
is not essential, but purely accidental, and
even equivocal; for it may equally belong to
these two species, or be wanting altogether, ac∣cording
to the differences of the climates. That
of the horns appears to be still less certain; for
they vary in number, size, figure, and direction.
In our domestic sheep, the rams have generally
horns, and the ewes have none. I have seen
sheep not only with two, but with four horns.
Those of the North and of Iceland have sometimes
eight. In warm countries, the rams have only
two short horns, and often want them, like the
ewes. In some, the horns are smooth and round;
in others, they are flat and chamfered. The
points, instead of being bended backward, are
sometimes turned outward, forward, &amp;c. This
character, therefore, is not more constant than
the former; and, consequently, it is not sufficient
to constitute different species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, with great propriety, instead of six species, has made six varieties only of domestic sheep. 1. <HI>Ovis rustica cornuta. 2. Anglica mutica, cauda scrotoque ad genua pendulis. 3. Hispanica cornuta, spira extrorsum tracta. 4. Polycerata e Goth∣landia. 5. Africana pro lana pilis brevibus hirta 6.

All these sheep are only varieties, to which this author should have added the <HI>adimain</HI> or Guiney sheep, and the <HI>strepsicheros</HI> of Crete, instead of making them two different species. In the same manner, if he had seen the mouflon, and had known that it produced with the sheep, or had only consulted the passage of Pliny con∣cerning the mouflon, he would never have ranked it with the goat, but with the sheep. Brisson has not only placed the mouflon and strepsicheros, which he calls <HI>hircus laniger,</HI> among the goats, but he has made four distinct species of domestic sheep covered with wool, beside the domestic sheep of warm countries covered with hair, and the broad and long tailed sheep. All these seven we have reduced to a single species.</NOTE>. Neither can
<PB N="220" REF="243"/>
the thickness, or length of the tail, answer this
purpose; since it may be considered as an artifi∣cial
member, which by great care and abundance
of good nourishment, may be enlarged at plea∣sure.
Besides, among our domestic races, as in
certain British sheep, there are some which have
tails longer than the common kind. Our mo∣dern
naturalists, however, trusting solely to the
differences in the horns, the wool, and the large∣ness
of the tail, have made seven or eight di∣stinct
species out of the sheep-kind. The whole
of these we have reduced to one. And this
reduction seems to be so well founded, that there
is little prospect of its being overturned by fu∣ture
observations.</P>
<P>In composing the history of wild animals, we
found it convenient to examine them one by one,
without any regard to genus, but, in the do∣mestic
animals, on the contrary, it was necessary
not only to adopt, but to increase the number
of genera; because in Nature there exist only in∣dividuals,
and successions of individuals, that is,
species. Men have had no influence on inde∣pendent
animals; but they have greatly altered
and modified the domestic kinds. We have,
therefore, established physical and real genera,
<PB N="221" REF="244"/>
very different from those metaphysical and arbi∣trary
ones, which have no existence but in idea.
These physical genera are, in reality, composed
of all the species, which, by our management,
have been greatly variegated and changed; and,
as all those species, so differently modified by the
hand of man, have but one common origin in
Nature, the whole genus ought to constitute but
a single species. In writing, for example, the
history of tigers, we have admitted as many spe∣cies
as are really found in different parts of the
earth; because we are certain that man has ne∣ver
introduced any changes among these untrac∣table
and ferocious animals, who subsist at pre∣sent
in the same manner as they were originally
produced by Nature. The same remark applies
to all free and independent animals. But, in
composing the history of oxen and sheep, we
have reduced all the varieties of the oxen to one
ox, and all the varieties of the sheep to one sheep;
because it is equally certain that man, and not
Nature, has produced the different kinds
which we have enumerated. Every thing concurs in
supporting this idea, which, though clear in it∣self,
may not, perhaps, be sufficiently understood.
That all the oxen produce together, we are as∣sured
by the experiments of M. de la Nux, Ment∣zelius,
and Kalm: That all the sheep produce
with one another, with the mouflon, and even
with the goat, I know from my own experience.
All the varieties of oxen, therefore, form but one

species; and all the sheep, however numerous
their varieties, constitute only another species.</P>
<P>I am obliged, by the importance of the sub∣ject,
to repeat, that Nature is not to be judged
of by particular minute characters, and that by
these the differences of species are not to be de∣termined;
that methodical distributions, instead
of throwing light on the history of animals, ren∣der
it still more obscure, by a fruitless multipli∣cation
of denominations, and of species; by form∣ing
arbitrary genera, which Nature never knew;
by confounding real beings with creatures of i∣magination;
by giving false ideas of the essential
characteristics of species; and by mixing or se∣parating
them in an arbitrary manner, without
skill, and often without having examined or even
seen the individuals. It is for this reason that
our Nomenclators perpetually deceive themselves,
and publish nearly as many errors as lines. Of
this we have already given so many examples,
that nothing but the blindest and most obstinate
prejudice can possibly resist the evidence they af∣ford.
On this subject M. Gmelin talks very
sensibly, when treating of the animal under con∣sideration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“The <HI>argali,</HI> or <HI>stepnie-barani,</HI> which occupy,” says he, “the southern mountains of Siberia, from the river Irtis, as far as Kamtschatka, are extremely vivacious animals; and this vivacity seems to exclude them from the class of sheep, and to rank them with that of the stags. I shall here give a short description of them, from which it will appear, that neither sprightliness, nor inactivi∣ty, neither the wool nor hair with which an animal is cover∣ed, neither crooked nor straight horns, neither permanent horns, nor those which fall off annually, are marks sufficient∣ly characteristic to distinguish classes. Nature loves variety; and I am persuaded, that, if we knew better how to manage our senses, they would often lead us to more essential charac∣ters, with regard to the differences of animals, than we gene∣rally derive from reason, which seldom apprehends those marks but in a superficial manner. In this animal, the ex∣ternal form of the head, neck, and tail, corresponds with that of the stag. His vivacity also, as formerly remarked, is so great, that he seems to be still more wild than the stag. The individual I saw, though reputed to be only three years old, ten men durst not attack. The largest of this species are a∣bout the size of a fallow deer. The one I examined mea∣sured, from the ground to the top of the head, a Russian ell and a half in height. His length, from the root of the horns, was an ell and three quarters. The horns rise above and very near the eyes, and just before the ears. They first bend backward and then forward in a circular form. The tips turn upward and outward. The horns, from the root to the middle, are furrowed, but afterward become somewhat smoother. It is probably from the figure of the horns that the Russians have called this animal the <HI>wild sheep.</HI> If we can trust the natives of these provinces, his whole strength lies in his horns. They say that the rams of this species fight by striking each other with their horns; and, when any of them are knocked off, the aperture at the base is so large, that the young foxes frequently take shelter in the cavity. It is not difficult to estimate the force necessary to break off one of these horns, since they, as long as the animal lives, continue to augment both in thickness and length; and the part of the head also from which they spring, becomes always harder. It is said that a well grown horn, comprehending the curvatures, measures two ells in length; that it weighs between thirty and forty Russian pounds; and that, at the base, it is seven or eight inches in diameter. The horns of the one I saw were of a whitish yellow colour; but they turn browner and black∣er as the animal advances in years. He carries his ears, which are pointed and tolerably large, very erect. The hoofs are divided, and the fore legs are three quarters of an ell long, and the hind legs still longer. When the animal stands erect on a plain, his fore legs are always fully extended and straight, and those behind are crooked; and this curvature seems to diminish in proportion to the unequality of the ground over which he passes. On the neck there are some pendulous folds. The colour of the body is grayish mixed with brown. Along the back, there is a yellowish or rather reddish line; and the same colour appears behind, on the inside of the legs, and on the belly, where it is a little paler. This colour continues from the beginning of August till the spring, at the approach of which these animals cast their hair, and become every where more red. They cast their hair a second time about the end of July. This description applies to the males. The females are always smaller; and though they have similar horns, they are smaller and thinner, and even acquire not thickness with age. The horns are nearly straight, have no furrows, and much resemble those of our castrated he-goats.</P>
<P>In the internal parts, they resemble other ruminating ani∣mals. The stomach is composed of four different cavities, and the gall-bladder is considerably large. Their flesh is good, and has nearly the same taste with that of the roebuck. The fat is delicious, according to the testimony of the Kamt∣schatkan nations. They feed upon herbage. They couple in autumn, and bring forth one or two lambs in the spring.</P>
<P>By the hair, the taste of the flesh, the figure and vivacity of this animal, it belongs to the class of the stag. By the permanent horns, it is excluded from this class. The circular horns give it some resemblance to the sheep. It is distinguish∣ed from that animal by its vivacity and want of wool. Its hair, its abode upon high rocks, and its frequent combats, make it approach to the goats. But the crooked horns, and the want of a beard, exclude it from this class. Should we not rather regard this animal as constituting a particular class, and recognise it as the <HI>musimon</HI> of the antients? In a word, it has a strong resemblance to Pliny's description of the mu∣simon, and still more to that given by the learned Gesner;” <HI>Relation d'un voyage par terre à Kamtschatka, par Gmelin.</HI> This curious relation is written by a man of good sense, and much versed in natural history.</P></NOTE>.</P>

We are convinced, as M. Gmelin remarks,
that we can never acquire a knowledge of Na∣ture,
<PB N="224" REF="251"/>
but by a judicious use of our senses, by see∣ing,
examining, comparing, and, at the same
<PB N="225" REF="252"/>
time, by denying ourselves the liberty of fabricating
methodical distributions, contemptible systems,
in which animals are classed which the authors
never saw, and knew nothing more of them than
their names, which are often ambiguous, obscure,
and misapplied. The false employment of these
names confounds ideas in a farrago of words,
and drowns truth in a torrent of error. We are
likewise convinced, after examining the mouflon
alive, and comparing him with Gmelin's de∣scription,
that the argali is the same animal.
We formerly remarked, that this animal was

But it is still more nume∣rous
in the southern mountains of Siberia, under
a climate rather cold than temperate, where it
even appears to be larger, stronger, and more
vigorous. Hence it might equally supply the
north and the south: Its offspring might be ren∣dered
domestic. After suffering long the hard∣ships
of this state, it would degenerate; and,
according to the differences of climate and treat∣ment,
would assume relative characters, and new
habits of body, which, being afterward trans∣mitted
by generation, gave rise to our domestic
sheep, and all the other races formerly enume∣rated.</P>

<P>We have given the figure of a ram which was
shown at the fair of St. Germain, in the year
<PB N="227" REF="254"/>
1774, under the name of the <HI>ram of the Cape of
Good Hope.</HI> This same ram was exhibited, the
year preceding, under the denomination of the
<HI>Mogul ram with a thick tail.</HI> But we learned
that it was purchased at Tunis; and we think
that it is the same with the Barbary sheep former∣ly
represented, from which it differs only by the
shortness of its tail, which is also flatter, and
broader in the upper part. The head is likewise
proportionally thicker, and resembles that of the
Indian ram. The body is well covered with
wool, and the legs are short, even when com∣pared
with those of our own sheep. The figure
and size of the horns differ little from those of
the Barbary sheep. We have called it the <HI>ram
of Tunis,</HI> to distinguish it from the other; but
we are persuaded that they both belong to the
same country of Barbary, and that they are very
nearly of the same race.</P>
<P>We have likewise given the figure of a ram,
which was exhibited at the fair of Saint-Germain,
in the year 1774, under the name of the <HI>mor∣vant
of China.</HI> This ram is remarkable for a
kind of mane on his neck, and for long hairs
which hang down from his throat, and form a
kind of cravat. These hairs are a mixture of
red and gray, hard to the touch, and about ten
inches long. The hairs of the mane are red, not
very thick, extend as far as the middle of the
back, and are of the same colour and consistence
as those on the throat; but they are shorter, and
<PB N="228" REF="255"/>
mixed with some brown and black hairs. The
wool which covers the body is a little curled, and
soft at the extremity; but, near the skin of the
animal, it is straight and hard: In general, it is
about three inches long, and of a bright yellow
colour. The legs are of a deep red, and the
head is spotted with different shades of yellow.
The greatest part of the tail is yellow and white,
and in figure resembles that of a cow, being well
furnished with hair toward the extremity. This
ram stands lower on his legs than the common
kind, and he resembles the Indian ram more than
any other. His belly is very large, and not above
fourteen inches nine lines raised from the ground.
M. de Seve, who described this animal, adds,
that, from the grossness of the belly, this ram
had the appearance of a pregnant ewe. The
horns are nearly the same with those of our rams.
But the hoofs are not prominent, and they are
longer than those of the Indian ram.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, and now repeat, that
the mouflon is the primaeval stock of all the o∣ther
sheep, and that his constitution is sufficient∣ly
robust to enable him to subsist in cold, tem∣perate,
and warm climates. The wild rams of
Kamtschatka, says M. Steller, have the air of a
goat, and the hair of a rain-deer. Their horns
are so large, that some of them weigh from
twenty-five to thirty pounds. Spoons and other
utensils are made of them. These rams are as
active and nimble as roebucks. They inhabit

<P>I believe that few of the genuine mouflons
now exist in Corsica. The frequent wars which
happened in that island have probably accom∣plished
their destruction. But, in the figure of
their present races of sheep, we still find marks
of the former existence of the mouflon. In the
month of August 1774, we saw a Corsican ram,
which belonged to the Duc de la Vrillière. It
exceeded not the size of a French sheep. It was
white, low on its legs, and had long hair disposed
in locks. It had four large horns, the upper
two being more bulky than the under, and they
had rugosities like those of the mouflon.</P>

<P>THIS animal being known only under the
vague names of <HI>Sardinian hind,</HI> and <HI>stag
of the Ganges,</HI> we have preserved the appellation
given to it by Belon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">“In the court of this castle, there were a male and a female of a kind of <HI>stag</HI> or <HI>fallow deer,</HI> which we would never have recognised, if we had not suspected that it was the <HI>axis</HI> mentioned by Pliny, (<HI>lib. 8. cap.</HI> 21.) in the following words: <HI>In India…. et seram nomine Axim, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>innuli pelle, pluribus candi∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribusque maculis, sacram Libero Patri.</HI> Both of them wanted horns, and, like the fallow deer, had a long tail that hang as low as the hocks, by which we knew that they were not stags; and in fact, at first sight, we thought they were fallow deer. But, upon a closer examination, we rejected this opinion. The female is smaller than the male; and their skin was va∣riegated with round, white spots. The ground colour of the body was yellowish, and white on the belly. In this article they differ from the camelopard; for the ground colour of the camelopard is white, and the spots are reddish. Their voice is clearer than that of the stag; for, having heard them bray, we were certain that they could neither be fallow deer nor stags, and, therefore, believed them to be the <HI>axis</HI> of the an∣tients;” <HI>Belon, observ.</HI> p. 119.</NOTE>, which he borrowed from
<PB N="231" REF="267"/>
Pliny, both because the characters correspond
with Pliny's axis, and the name has never been
applied to any other quadruped; and, therefore,
we are in no danger of falling into error or con∣fusion;
for a generic denomination, accompanied
with an epithet derived from the climate, is not
a name, but a phrase by which an animal may
be confounded with others of its own genus, as
the present animal with the stag, though, per∣haps,
it is different both in species and in cli∣mate.
The axis is one of the small number of
ruminating animals which carry horns, like those
of the stag. He has the stature and swiftness of
the fallow-deer. But, what distinguishes him
from both, he has the horns of the stag, and the
figure of the fallow deer; his whole body is
marked with white spots, elegantly disposed, and
separate from each other; and, lastly, he is a
native of warm climates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal was in the royal managerie, under the name of the <HI>Ganges stag.</HI> From this denomination, as well as from the passages of Pliny and Belon, it appears that he is a native of warm countries. The testimonies of travellers, which we are about to quote, confirm this fact, and at the same time prove, that the common species of the stag is not much diffused beyond the temperate climates, “I never saw, says le Maire,” “stags at Senegal with horns like those of France;” <HI>Voyage de le Maire, p.</HI> 190.—“In the peninsula of India, on this side the Ganges, there are stags whose bodies are all inter∣spersed with white spots;” <HI>Voyage de la Compagnie des Indes de Hollande, tom. 4. p.</HI> 423.—“At Bengal, we find stags which are spotted like tigers;” <HI>Voyage de Luillier, p.</HI> 54.</NOTE>. But the hair of the
<PB N="232" REF="268"/>
stag and fallow-deer is generally of a uniform
colour, and they are very numerous in cold and
temperate regions, as well as in warm climates.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences
have given a figure and a description of the in∣ternal
parts of this animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The height of these hinds, from the top of the back to the tail, was two feet eight inches. The neck was a foot long, and the hind legs three feet. Their hair was of four colours, namely, yellow, white, black, and gray. It was white on the belly and on the inside of the thighs and legs. The back was a yellowish brown, and the flanks were of a dun yellow, or isabella colour. These ground colours were variegated with white spots, of different figures. Along the back were two rows of spots in a straight line; the other spots were scatter∣ed without any order. On each side of the flanks there was a white line. The neck and head were gray; the tail was all white below, black above, and the hair of it was six inches long; <HI>Mem. pour servir à Phist. des animaux, part. 2. p.</HI> 73.</NOTE>; but they have said
little concerning its external form, and nothing
relative to its history. They have simply called
it the <HI>Sardinian hind,</HI> probably because it was
brought to the royal menagerie under that name.
But we have no evidence of this animal's being
a native of Sardinia. It is mentioned by no au∣thor
as existing wild in this island: On the con∣trary,
we see, from the passages already quoted,
that it is found in the warmest countries of Asia.
Hence the denomination of <HI>Sardinian hind</HI> has
been falsely applied: That of <HI>Ganges stag</HI>
would have been more proper, if it had belonged to the
<PB N="233" REF="269"/>
stag species, because that part of India, through
which the Ganges runs, appears to be its native
country. It seems, however, to be likewise
found in Barbary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Arabs call likewise a species of fallow deer <HI>Bekker-el-Wash,</HI> which has the horns of a stag, but is not so large. Those which I saw had been taken in the mountains near Sgigata, and appeared to be of a mild and tractable disposition.

is the same animal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We saw, at the Cape of Good Hope, a kind of spotted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allow deer, which were somewhat smaller than those of Eu∣rope….. Their spots were white and yellow. They al∣ways go in flocks; <HI>Descript. du Cap. de Bonne-Esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 1. p.</HI> 120.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that no species<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the article <HI>Fallow deer,</HI> vol. IV. of this work.</NOTE> made
so near an approach to another, as the fallow
deer to the stag. The axis, however, seems to
form an intermediate shade between the two.
It resembles the fallow deer in the size of the
body, the length of the tail, and in a kind of li∣very
which it perpetually wears: There is no
essential difference but in the horns, which want
brow antlers, and resemble those of the stag. The
axis, therefore, may be a variety only, and not a
different species from that of the fallow deer;
for, though it is an original native of the warmest
countries of Asia, it easily subsists and multiplies
in Europe. There are flocks of them in the me∣nagerie
of Paris. They produce among them∣selves
with equal facility as the fallow deer.
<PB N="234" REF="270"/>
They have never been observed, however, to
intermix with the fallow deer, nor with the stags,
which has led us to presume that they are not a
variety either of the one or of the other, but a
distinct: intermediate species. But, as no deci∣sive
experiments have been made on this subject,
as no necessary means have been used to oblige
these animals to join, we do not assert positively
that they belong to different species.</P>
<P>We have already seen, under the articles <HI>stag</HI>
and <HI>fallow deer,</HI> how liable these animals are to
varieties, especially in the colour of their hair.
The species of the fallow deer and stag, without
being numerous in individuals, are very much
diffused. Both are found in either Continent,
and both are subject to a great number of varie∣ties,
which seem to form permanent races. The
white stags, whose race is very antient, since
they are mentioned by the Greeks and Romans,
and the small brown stags, which we have called
<HI>Corsican stags,</HI> are not the only varieties of this
species. In Germany, there is another race,
known in that country under the name of <HI>Brand∣hirtz</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alterum cervi genus, ignotius, priore majus, pinguius, tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pilo densius et colore nigrius; unde Germanis a semiusti ligni colore <HI>Brandhirtz</HI> nominatur: Hoc in Misenae saltibus Boëmiae vicinis reperitur; <HI>Fabricius, apud Gesner, Hist. quad. p.</HI> 297.</NOTE>,

only in its deeper and almost black colour, but
by long hair between the soulders and on the
throat. This kind of mane and beard give him
some relation, the first to the horse, and the se∣cond
to the he-goat. The antients bestowed on
this stag the compound names of <HI>hippelaphus</HI>
and <HI>tragelaphus.</HI> As these denominations have
occasioned many critical discussions, in which
the most learned naturalists by no means agree,
and as Gesner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner Hist. quad. p. 491. et 492.</NOTE>, Caius, and others, tell us that
the <HI>hippelaphus</HI> was the rain deer, we thought it
proper here to give the reasons which make us
think differently, and lead us to believe, that the
hippelaphus of Aristotle, is the same animal with
the tragelaphus of Pliny, and that both these
names equally denote the stag of Ardennes.</P>

The short description he has given of them, the climate, their resemblance to the ox, and their black colour, have made this philosopher believe that they differed not more from the domestic oxen, than the wild boar from the common hog. But, as we formerly remarked, the buffalo and ox are two distinct species. If the antients have bestowed no particular name on the buffalo, it is because this animal was a stranger to them, because their knowledge of him was imperfect, and they regarded him as a wild ox, which differed from the domestic ox by some slight varieties only.</NOTE> gives to his hippelaphus a kind of
mane upon the neck and top of the shoulders, a
<PB N="236" REF="272"/>
beard under the throat, horns to the male simi∣lar
to those of the roebuck, and no horns to the
female. He says that the hippelaphus is as large
as the stag, and is produced among the Arachotas,
a people of India, where there are also wild oxen,
whose bodies are very robust, their skin black,
their muzzle elevated, and their horns bended
more backward than those of the domestic ox.
It must be acknowledged, that Aristotle's cha∣racters
of the hippelaphus will apply almost e∣qually
well to the rain deer and to the stag of
Ardennes. They have both long hair upon the
neck and shoulders, and likewise on the throat,
which forms a kind of beard upon the gullet,
and not on the chin. But the hippelaphus, which
is only of the size of the stag, differs in this par∣ticular
from the rain deer, which is much larger;
but what appears to decide this question, the rain
deer being an animal peculiar to cold countries,
never existed among the Arachotas. This coun∣try
of the Arachotas is one of the provinces
which Alexander over-ran in his expedition into
India. It is situated beyond Mount Caucasus,
<PB N="237" REF="273"/>
between Persia and India. This warm country
never produced rain deer; for they cannot sub∣sist
in temperate countries, and are found only
in the northern regions of both Continents. The
stags, on the contrary, have no particular attach∣ment
to the north; for they are very numerous
both in temperate and warm climates. Hence
the hippelaphus of Aristotle, which is found a∣mong
the Arachotas, and in the same countries
with the buffalo, is unquestionably the stag of
Ardennes, and not the rain deer.</P>
<P>Now, if we compare what Pliny has said of
the tragelaphus, with what Aristotle has advan∣ced
concerning the hippelaphus, and both with
nature, we will perceive that the tragelaphus is
the same animal with the hippelaphus, and con∣sequently
the same with our stag of Ardennes.
Pliny remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eadem est specie (cervi videlicet) barba tantum, et ar∣morum villo distans quem <HI>tragelaphon</HI> vocant, non alibi quam juxta Phasin amnem, nascens; <HI>Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 33,</NOTE> that the tragelaphus belongs to
the species of stag, and differs from him only by
the beard and the hair on its shoulders. These
characters are positive, and can only apply to the
stag of Ardennes; for Pliny, in another place,
mentions the rain deer under the name of <HI>Alca.</HI>
He adds, that the tragelaphus is found in the
neighbourhood of Phasis, which still farther a∣grees
with the stag, and not with the rain deer.
We may, therefore, safely pronounce, that the
tragelaphus of Pliny, and the hippelaphus of A∣ristotle,
both denote the animal which we call
<PB N="238" REF="274"/>
the <HI>stag of Ardennes;</HI> and that the axis of Pliny
is the animal commonly denominated the <HI>Ganges
stag.</HI> Though names have no influence upon
nature, the explication of them is of great use to
those who study her productions.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1765, the Duke of Richmond had,
in his parks, a number of that species of the fal∣low
deer, commonly known by the name of
<HI>Ganges stags,</HI> and which I have called <HI>axis.</HI> Mr
Colinson assures me, that they propagated with
the ordinary kind of fallow deer.</P>
<P>“They live spontaneously,” he remarks, “with
the fallow deer, and form not separate flocks.
It is more than sixty years since this species
existed in England, where they had been trans∣ported
before the white and black fallow deer,
and even before the stag, which last, I suppose,
was brought from France; because, previous
to that period, there were in England only the
common fallow deer, and the Scots roebuck.
But, beside this first species, we have now▪ the
axis, the black, the yellow, and the white fal∣low
deer. The mixture of all these colours
has produced most beautiful varieties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de M. Colinson à M. de Buffon.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>In the year 1764, we had a male and female
Chinese fallow deer at the menagerie of Versailles.

In height, they exceeded not two feet four
inches. The body and tail were of a dark brown
colour, and the belly and limbs of a bright yel∣low.
The legs were short, the horns large and
garnished with antlers. This species, though
smaller than the common fallow deer, and even
than the axis, is perhaps only a variety of the
latter, though it has no white spots; but, instead
of these white spots, it had, in some places, large
yellow hairs, which had a considerable effect up∣on
the brown colour of the body. In fine, the
colour of the female was the same as that of the
male; and, it is probable, that the race might not
only be perpetuated in France, but that it might
even intermix with the axis, especially as both
these animals are natives of the eastern regions
of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>The ZEBU, or DWARF OX<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The zebu from which the following description was ta∣ken, was not larger than a calf of five weeks old. We knew it, however, to be an adult, and at least seven or eight years of age, by inspection of its teeth. It arrived at the menagerie of Versailles in the month of August 1761, and its horns were then as large as they are now in the year 1763. They are five inches three lines long, and four inches three lines in cir∣cumference at the base. They are black at the points, and in every other respect resemble those of the common ox. It has a bunch on the withers four inches and a half high, and its circumference at the base is sixteen inches. In other articles, it differs not in figure from our ox, excepting that its legs and feet are proportionally smaller, and its ears longer.</P>
<P>The tuft of hair above the coronet is black. The legs and upper part of the tail are yellowish. The under part, and the long hairs at the point of the tail, are white, and a foot in length. The rest of the body is variegated with black and brown spots, of different dimensions, and slightly tinged with a reddish colour.</P>

<P>THIS is the largest animal of the New
World, where, as formerly remarked, a∣nimated
Nature seems to be contracted, or
<PB N="244" REF="283"/>
rather not to have had time sufficient to ac∣quire
her full dimensions. Instead of the huge
masses produced by the antient lands of Asia,
instead of the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopota∣mus,
camelopard, and camel, all the creatures
of these new lands are modelled upon a small
scale. The tapirs, the lamas, the pacos, and the
cabiais, are twenty times smaller than the ani∣mals
of the Old World to which they should
respectively be compared. Here matter is not
only used with a niggardly hand, but even forms
are imperfect, and seem to have failed or been
neglected. Almost the whole animals of South
America, which alone can be regarded as pecu∣liar
to the New World, have neither tusks,
horns, nor tails. Their figure is aukward; their
bodies and members are ill proportioned; and
some of them, as the ant-eaters, the sloth, &amp;c. are
so miserably formed, that they have hardly the
powers of moving, or eating their food. With
<PB N="245" REF="284"/>
much difficulty they drag out a painful and lan∣guishing
life in the solitudes of the desert, and
cannot subsist in inhabited regions, where man
and the stronger animals would soon destroy
them.</P>
<P>The tapir is of the size of a small cow, or
zebu; but has neither horns nor tail. His legs
are short, and his body arched. When young,
he is spotted, like the stag; and afterwards his
hair becomes of a uniform deep brown colour.
His head is large, and terminates, like that of
the rhinoceros, in a long trunk. He has ten
cutting teeth and an equal number of grinders in
each jaw, a character which separates him entirely
from the ox kind, and from all other ruminating
animals. As we have only some skins of this
animal, and a drawing sent us by M. Conda∣mine,
we cannot do better than transcribe the
descriptions of him made from the life by Marc∣grave

<HEAD>OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>FIRST VIEW.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE is that system of laws established
by the Creator for regulating the exis∣tence
of bodies, and the succession of beings.
Nature is not a body; for this body would com∣prehend
every thing. Neither is it a being;
for this being would necessarily be God. But
Nature may be considered as an immense living
power, which animates the universe, and which,
in subordination to the first and supreme Being,
began to act by his command, and its action is
still continued by his concurrence or consent.
This power is that portion of the divine power
which manifests itself to men. It is at once the
cause and the effect, the mode and the substance,
the design and the execution. Very different
from human art, whose productions are only
dead works, Nature is herself a work perpetual∣ly
alive, an active and never ceasing operator,
who knows how to employ every material, and,
though always labouring on the same invariable
plan, her power, instead of being lessened, is
perfectly inexhaustible. Time, space, and mat∣ter,
are her means; the universe her object; mo∣tion
and life her end.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="290"/>
The phaenomena of the universe are the ef∣fects
of this power. The springs she employs
are active forces, which time and space can only
measure and limit, but never destroy; forces which
balance, mix, and oppose, without being able
to annihilate each other. Some penetrate and
transport bodies, others heat and animate them.
Attraction and impulsion are the two prin∣cipal
instruments by which this power acts
upon brute matter. Heat and organic particles
are the active principles she employs in the for∣mation
and expansion of organized beings.</P>
<P>With such instruments, what can limit the o∣perations
of Nature? To render her omnipotent,
she wants only the power of creating and an∣nihilating.
But these two extremes of power
the Almighty has reserved to himself alone. To
create and to annihilate, are his peculiar attri∣butes.
To change, to destroy, to unfold, to re∣new,
to produce, are the only privileges he has
conferred on another agent. Nature, the mini∣ster
of his irrevocable commands, the depositary
of his immutable decrees, never deviates from
the laws he has prescribed to her. She alters no
part of his original plan; and, in all her opera∣tions,
the exhibits the seal of the eternal Lord
of the universe. This divine impression, this
unalterable prototype of all existence, is the
model upon which she operates; a model, all
the features of which are expressed in characters
so strongly marked, that nothing can possibly ef∣face;
<PB N="251" REF="291"/>
a model which the number of copies or
impressions, though infinite, instead of imparing,
only renews.</P>
<P>Every thing, therefore, has been created, and
nothing is annihilated. Nature vibrates between
these two extremes, without ever approaching
either the one or the other. Let us endeavour
to lay hold of her in some points of this vast
space which she has filled and pervaded from the
beginning of ages.</P>
<P>What an infinity of objects! an immense mass
of matter, which would have been created in vain,
if it had not been divided into portions, sepa∣rated
from each other by spaces a thousand times
more immense. Thousands of luminous globes,
placed at inconceivable distances, are the bases
which support the fabric of the universe; and
millions of opaque globes, which circulate round
the former, constitute the moving order of its
architecture. These great masses are revolved,
and carried through space, by two primitive
forces, each of which acts continually; and
their combined efforts produce the zones of the
celestial spheres, and establish, in the midst of
vacuity, fixed stations and determined routes or
orbits. It is motion that gives rise to the equi∣librium
of worlds, and the repose of the uni∣verse.</P>
<P>The first of these forces is equally divided;
the second is distributed in unequal proportions.
Every atom of matter has the same quantity of
<PB N="252" REF="292"/>
attractive force; and a different quantity of im∣pulsive
force is assigned to each individual globe.
Some stars are fixed, and others wandering.
Some globes seem to be destined for attracting,
and others for impelling, or being impelled.
There are spheres which have received a com∣mon
impulsion in the same direction, and others
a particular impulsion. Some stars are solitary,
and others accompanied with satellites: Some
are luminous, and others opaque masses. There
are planets, the different parts of which succes∣sively
enjoy a borrowed light, and comets, which
lose themselves in the profundity of space, and
return, after many ages, to receive the influence
of solar heat. Some suns appear and disappear,
and seem to be alternately kindled and extinguish∣ed;
others exhibit themselves for once, and then
vanish forever. Heaven is a country of great e∣vents;
but the human eye is hardly able to per∣ceive
them. A sun, which perishes, and destroys
a world, or a system of worlds, has no other
effect on our eyes than an ignis fatuus, which
gives a transitory blaze, and appears no more.
Man, limited to the terrestrial atom on which
he vegetates, views this atom as a world, and
sees worlds only as atoms.</P>
<P>The earth which man inhabits, hardly per∣ceptable
among the other globes, and totally
invisible to the distant spheres, is a million of
times smaller than the sun by which it is illumi∣nated,
and a thousand times smaller than some
ether planets, which are also subjected to the
<PB N="253" REF="293"/>
power of the sun, and obliged to circulate a∣round
him. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Earth,
Venus, Mercury, and the Sun, occupy the small
part of the heavens which we call <HI>our Universe.</HI>
All these planets with their satellites, moving
with rapidity in the same direction, and nearly
in the same plane, compose a wheel of an im∣mense
diameter, whose axis supports the whole
weight, and which, by the celerity of its own
rotation, must inflame and diffuse heat and light
to every part of the circumference. As long as
these movements continue, (and they will be e∣ternal,
unless the hand of the prime Mover inter∣pose,
and exert as much force to destroy, as was
necessary to create them), the sun will burn, and
fill all the spheres of this universe with his splen∣dour:
And as, in a system where all bodies at∣tract
each other, nothing can be lost, or remove
without returning, the quantity of matter remain∣ing
always the same, this fertile source of light
and life can never be dried up or exhausted; for
the other suns, which likewise dart forth their
fires continually, restore to our sun as much light
as they receive from him.</P>
<P>The comets, which are much more numerous
than the planets, and, like the latter, depend on
the power of the sun, press also on this common
focus, and, by augmenting the weight, increase
the inflammation. They constitute a part of our
universe; for, like the planets, they are subjec∣ted
to the attraction of the sun. But, in their
<PB N="254" REF="294"/>
projectile or impelled motions, they have no∣thing
in common, either among themselves, or
with the planets. Each circulates in a different
plane; and they describe orbits in very different
periods of time; for some perform their revolu∣tions
in a few years, and others require several
centuries. The sun, revolving round his own
centre, remains, in other respects, perfectly at
rest in the midst of the whole, and serves, at the
same time, as a torch, a focus, and an axis to all
the parts of this vast machine.</P>
<P>It is by his magnitude alone that the sun re∣mains
immoveable, and regulates the motions of
the other globes. As the force of attraction is
proportioned to the mass of matter, as the sun
is incomparably larger than any of the comets,
and contains a thousand times more matter than
the largest planet, they can neither derange him,
nor diminish his influence, which, by extending
to immense distances, restrains the whole, and,
at fixed periods, recalls those which have stretch∣ed
farthest into the regions of space. Some of
them, when they return, make so near an ap∣proach
to the sun, that, after cooling for ages,
they undergo an inconceivable degree of heat.
They are subjected to strange vicissitudes from
these alternate extremes of heat and cold, as
well as from the inequalities of their motions,
which are sometimes prodigiously accelerated, and
at other times almost infinitely retarded. When
compared with the planets, the comets may be
<PB N="255" REF="295"/>
considered as worlds in disorder; for the orbits
of the planets are more regular, and their move∣ments
more equal; their temperature is always
the same; they seem to be places of repose,
where, every thing being permanent, Nature is
enabled to establish a uniform plan of operation,
and to mature successively all her various pro∣ductions.
Among the planets, that which we
inhabit seems to enjoy peculiar privileges. Less
cold and less distant than Saturn, Jupiter, and
Mars, it is also not so much scorched as Venus
and Mercury, who appear to be too near the
body of the sun. Besides, with what magnifi∣cence
does Nature shine upon the earth? A
pure light, which gradually stretches from east
to west, alternately gilds both hemispheres of
this globe. It is surrounded with a light and
transparent element. A mild and fertile heat
animates and unfolds all the germs of exis∣tence;
and they are nourished and supported by
wholesome waters. Various eminences, distribu∣ted
over the surface of the land, stop and collect
the moist vapours which float in the air, and give
rise to perpetual fountains. Immense cavities,
destined for the reception of these waters, sepa∣rate
islands and continents. The extent of the
sea is as great as that of the land. This is not
a cold and barren element. It is a new empire
equally rich, and equally peopled with the for∣mer.
The limits of the waters are marked out
by the finger of God. If the sea encroaches on
<PB N="256" REF="296"/>
the western shores, it deserts those of the east.
This vast mass of water, though naturally inac∣tive,
is agitated by the influence of the celestial
bodies, which produces the regular motions of
the flux and reflux. It rises and falls with the
course of the moon; and, when the action of the
sun and moon concurs, it rises still higher. Both
these causes uniting during the time of the e∣quinoxes,
is the reason why the tides are then
highest. This is the strongest mark of our
connection with the heavens. These constant
and general movements give rise to variable and
particular motions; to transportations of earth,
which, falling to the bottom in the form of se∣diment,
produce mountains similar to those on
the surface of the land; to currents, which, fol∣lowing
the direction of those chains of moun∣tains,
bestow on them a figure whose angles cor∣respond,
and, running in the midst of the waves,
as waters run on the land, are really sea-rivers.</P>
<P>The air, still lighter and more fluid than
water, is likewise subject to a number of powers.
Continual agitations are produced in it by the
distant influence of the sun and moon, by the
immediate action of the sea, and by the rarefac∣tion
and condensation of heat and cold. The
winds are its currents. They push and col∣lect
the clouds. They produce meteors, and
transport to the arid surface of islands and con∣tinents
the moist vapours of the ocean. They
give rise to storms, and diffuse and distribute
<PB N="257" REF="297"/>
the fertile dew and rains. They disturb the
movements of the sea, agitate the waters, stop
or precipitate the currents, elevate the waves,
and raise tremendous tempests: The troubled
ocean rises toward the heavens, and rolls on
with noise and violence against those immove∣able
barriers, which, with all its efforts, it can
neither destroy nor surmount.</P>
<P>The earth, elevated above the level of the o∣cean,
is defended against its irruptions. Its sur∣face,
enamelled with flowers, adorned with a
verdure which is always renewing, and peo∣pled
with numberless species of animals, is a
place of perfect repose, a delightful habitation,
where man, destined to aid the intentions of Na∣ture,
presides over every other being. He a∣lone
is capable of knowledge, and dignified with
the faculty of admiration: God, therefore, has
made him the spectator of the universe, and the
witness of his perpetual miracles. The ray of
divinity with which he is animated, makes him
participate the mysteries of the Deity. It is by
this light that he thinks and reflects, that he
perceives and understands the wonderful opera∣tions
of his Creator.</P>
<P>Nature is the external throne of the divine
magnificence. Man who contemplates her, rises
gradually to the internal throne of the Almighty.
Formed to adore his Creator, he has dominion
over every creature. The vassal of heaven, the
lord of the earth, he peoples, ennobles, and
enriches this lower world. Among living be∣ings,
<PB N="258" REF="298"/>
he establishes order, subordination, and har∣mony.
To Nature herself he even gives im∣bellishment,
cultivation, extension, and polish.
He cuts down the thistle and the bramble, and
he multiplies the vine and the rose. View those
melancholy deserts where man has never resi∣ded.
Over-run with briers, thorns, and trees
which are deformed, broken, corrupted, the seeds
that ought to renew and embellish the scene
are choaked and buried in the midst of rubbish
and sterility. Nature, who, in other situations,
assumes the splendour of youth, has here the ap∣pearance
of old age and decrepitude. The earth,
surcharged with the spoils of its productions, in∣stead
of a beautiful verdure, presents nothing
but a disordered mass of gross herbage, and of trees
loaded with parasitical plants, as lichens, agarics,
and other impure fruits of corruption: All the
low grounds are occupied with putrid and stag∣nating
waters; the miry lands, which are nei∣ther
solid nor fluid, are impassable, and remain e∣qually
useless to the inhabitants of the earth and of
the waters; and the marshes, which are cover∣ed
with stinking aquatic plants, serve only to
nourish venomous insects, and to harbour im∣pure
animals. Between those putrid marshes
which occupy the low grounds, and the decay∣ed
forests which cover the elevated parts of the
country, there is a species of lands, or savan∣na's,
that have no resemblance to our meadows.
There noxious herbs rise and choak the useful
<PB N="259" REF="299"/>
kinds. Instead of that fine enamelled turf, which
appears to be the down of the earth, we see no∣thing
but rude vegetables, hard prickly plants, so
interlaced together, that they seem to have less
hold of the earth than of each other, and which,
by successively drying and shooting, form a coarse
mat of several feet in thickness. There is no road,
no communication, no vestige of intelligence, in
these savage and desolate regions. Man, reduced to
the necessity of following the tracks of wild beasts,
when he wants to kill them, obliged to watch,
perpetually lest he should fall a victim to their
rage, terrified by their occasional roarings, and
even struck with the awful silence of those pro∣found
solitudes, he shrinks back and says: “Un∣cultivated
Nature is hideous and languishing.
It is I alone who can render her agreeable
and vivacious. Let us drain these marshes;
let us animate these waters by converting them
into brooks and canals; let us employ this ac∣tive
and devouring element, whose nature was
formerly concealed from us; let us set fire to
this cumbersome load of vegetables, and to those
superannuated forests, which are already half
consumed; let us finish the work by destroy∣ing
with iron what could not be dissipated by
fire. Instead of rushes, and water-lilies, from
which the toad is said to extract his poison,
we shall soon see the ranunculus, the truffle,
and other mild and salutary herbs; flocks of
sprightly cattle will brouse upon this land,
<PB N="260" REF="300"/>
which was formerly impassable; here they will
find abundance of food, a never failing pasture,
and they will continue to multiply, and to re∣ward
us for our labours, and the protection
we have afforded them. To complete the
work, let the ox be subjected to the yoke;
let his strength and the weight of his body
be employed in ploughing the ground, which
acquires fresh vigour by culture. Thus will
Nature acquire redoubled strength and splen∣dour
from the skill and industry of man.”</P>
<P>How beautiful is cultivated Nature! how
pompous and brilliant, when decorated by the
hand of man! He himself is her chief ornament,
her noblest production. By multiplying his
own species, he increases the most precious of
her works. She even seems to multiply in
the same proportion with him; for, by his art,
he brings to light every thing which she con∣cealed
in her bosom. What a source of un∣known
treasures! Flowers, fruits, and grains
matured to perfection, and multiplied to infini∣ty;
the useful species of animals transported,
propagated, and increased without number; the
noxious kinds diminished; and banished from
the abodes of men; gold, and iron a more use∣ful
metal, extracted from the bowels of the earth;
torrents restrained, and rivers directed and con∣fined
within their banks; even the ocean itself
subdued, investigated, and traversed from the
one hemisphere to the other; the earth every
<PB N="261" REF="301"/>
where accessible, and rendered active and fertile;
the vallies and plains converted into smiling
meadows, rich pastures, and cultivated fields;
the hills loaded with vines and fruits, and their
summits crowned with useful trees; the deserts
turned into populous cities, whose inhabitants
spread from its centre to its utmost extremities;
open and frequented roads and communications
every where established, as so many evidences
of the union and strength of society. A thou∣sand
other monuments of power and of glory
sufficiently demonstrate that man is the lord of
the earth; that he has entirely changed and re∣newed
its surface; and that, from the remotest
periods of time, he alone has divided the empire
of the world between him and Nature.</P>
<P>He reigns, however, by the right of conquest
only. He enjoys rather than possesses; and pre∣serves
his privileges by perpetual vigilance and
activity. If these are interrupted, every thing
languishes, alters, and returns to the absolute do∣minion
of Nature. She resumes her rights, ef∣faces
the operations of man, covers with moss
and dust his most pompous monuments, which,
in the progress of time, she totally destroys, and
leaves him only the regret of having lost by his
own fault, what his ancestors had acquired by
their industry. Those periods, when man loses
his empire, those barbarous ages in which every
thing of value perishes, commence with war,
and are completed by famine and depopula∣tion.
Man, whose strength consists solely in the
<PB N="262" REF="302"/>
union of numbers, and whose happiness is de∣rived
from peace, is yet mad enough to take
up arms, and to fight, which are never failing
sources of misery and ruin. Incited by insatiable
avarice, and by blind ambition, which is still
more insatiable, he renounces the feelings of hu∣manity,
turns all his strength against himself,
and his whole desires centre in the destruction
of his own species, which he soon accomplishes.
After these days of blood and carnage, when the
intoxicating fumes of glory are dispelled, he
surveys, with a melancholy eye, the earth de∣solated,
the arts buried, nations dispersed,
an enfeebled people, the ruin ot his own happi∣ness,
and the annihilation of his real power.</P>

and maintains harmony among the laws of

<P>WHETHER we consider symmetry of
shape, or beauty of colours, the zebra
is perhaps the most elegant of all quadrupeds.
In this animal, the figure and gracefulness of the
horse are united with the nimbleness of the stag.
His robe is adorned with black and white belts
or ribbons, alternately disposed, with such regu∣larity
and exact proportion, that Nature seems
here to have employed the rule and the compass.
These alternate bands of black and white are the
more singular, because they are straight, parallel,
and as nicely separated as those of a striped
stuff. Besides, they extend not only over the
body, but the head, thighs, legs, and even the
<PB N="265" REF="305"/>
ears and tail; so that, at a distance, the whole
body of the animal has the appearance of being
artificially adorned, in the most elegant manner,
with ribbons. In the female, these bands are
alternately black and white, and black and yel∣low
in the male. The shades are always lively
and brilliant; and the hair is short, close, and
fine, the lustre of which augments the beauty of
the colours. The zebra, in general, is smaller
than the horse, and larger than the ass. Though
he has often been compared to these two ani∣mals,
under the names of the <HI>wild horse</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Equus ferus genere suo; zebra; <HI>Klein, de quad. p.</HI> 5.</NOTE>, and
<HI>striped ass</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Infortunatum animal, quod tam pulchris coloribus prae∣ditum, <HI>Asini</HI> nomen in Europa serre cogatur. Vide Ludol∣phi comment, p. 150. Ibique zebrae figuram.</NOTE>, he is not a copy of either, but
should rather be regarded as their model, if in
Nature every species were not equally original,
and had not an equal right to creation.</P>
<P>The zebra, therefore, is neither a horse nor
an ass; for, though it has often been attempted,
we never learned that they intermixed and pro∣duced
together. She-asses in season were pre∣sented
to the zebra which was in the menagerie
of Versailles in the year 1761. He disdained
them, or rather discovered no emotion. He,
however, sported with them, and even mounted
them, but without discovering any desire, or ex∣ternal
sign. This coldness could be attributed
to no other cause than an unsuitableness in the
<PB N="266" REF="306"/>
natures of the two animals; for the zebra was
four years of age, and, in every other exercise,
was sprightly and vigorous.</P>
<P>The zebra is not the animal mentioned by the
antients under the name of <HI>onager.</HI> In the Le∣vant,
in the eastern parts of Asia, and in the
north of Africa, there is a fine race of asses,
which, like the most beautiful horses, originated
in Arabia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Persia there are two kinds of asses; those belonging to the country, which, like ours, are slow and stupid, and used for carrying burdens only; and the Arabian asses, which are extremely handsome, and the most excellent of the species. They have smooth hair, a high head, and nimble limbs. They are used solely for riding….Like horses, they are train∣ed to amble; and their motion is extremely soft, and so fleet, that it requires a gallop to keep up with them; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p. 27. Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 20.</NOTE>. This race differs from the com∣mon
kind by the largeness of its body, the
nimbleness of its limbs, and the lustre of its hair.
They are of one uniform colour, which is a
beautiful mouse gray, with a black cross on the
back and shoulders. Sometimes their colour is
a brighter gray, with a whitish cross<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At Bassora, I saw a wild ass. Its figure differed not from that of the domestic kind; but its colour was brighter, and, from the head to the tail, there was a band of whitish hair….In running, and in every other motion, it seemed to be much more nimble than the common kind; <HI>Voyage de Pietra della Val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, tom. 8. p.</HI> 49.</NOTE>. These
African and Asiatic asses<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Moors, who come to Cape-Verd to traffick, carry their baggage and wares upon asses. These animals were so beautiful and so smooth skinned, that it was with difficulty I could recognise them to be asses. Those of Europe, I ima∣gine, would be in the same condition, if their labour and the manner in which they are loaded did not greatly disfigure them. Their hair was of a beautiful, shining, mouse gray colour, upon which the black band along the back, and across the shoulders, had a fine effect. These asses are a little lar∣ger than ours. Their head, however, is easily distinguishable from that of the horse, especially the Barbary horse, which is a native of this country, and of a still higher stature; <HI>Voyage au Senegal, par M. Adanson, p.</HI> 148.—There are great num∣bers of wild asses in the deserts of Numidia and Lybia, and the adjacent country. They are so fleet, that the Barbary horses alone are able to overtake them in the course. As soon as they see a man, they stop, fling up their heels, and cry; and, when he is near, they run off. They are taken by various kinds of snares. They go in troops to pasture and to drink. Their flesh is very good; but it must be allowed to cool two days after being roasted, on account of its strong smell. We have seen a number of these animals in Sardi∣nia; but they were smaller; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p.</HI> 53.</NOTE>, though more beau∣tiful
<PB N="267" REF="307"/>
than those of Europe, proceed equally from
the <HI>onagri</HI> or <HI>wild asses,</HI> which are still nume∣rous
in South and East Tartary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The animal which the Mogul Tartars call <HI>Czigithai,</HI> and which Messerschmid has denominated <HI>mulus foecundus Dau∣ricus,</HI> is the same with the <HI>onager</HI> or <HI>wild ass.</HI></NOTE>, in Persia,
Syria, the islands of the Archipelago, and in
Mauritania<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We find many wild asses in the islands of Peine, and of Levata or Lebinthos….They are also found in the island of Cythera, now called <HI>Cerigo; Descript. des isles de l' Archipel. par Dapper, p.</HI> 185. 378.</NOTE>. The onagers differ from the do∣mestic
asses by those qualities only which result
from freedom and independence: They are
stronger and more nimble, and they have more
courage and vivacity. The figure of their bodies
<PB N="268" REF="308"/>
is the same, though their hair is longer. This
difference depends likewise on their condition;
for our asses would have hair equally long, if
they were not shorn at the age of four or five
months. The hair of a colt is at first nearly as
long as that of a young bear. The skin of the
wild ass is equally hard as that of the domestic
kind, and we are assured that it is full of small
tubercles. The chagrin brought from the Le∣vant,
which we employ for various purposes, is
said to be made of the wild ass's skin.</P>
<P>But, neither the onager, nor the fine asses of
Arabia, can be regarded as the origin of the
zebra species, though they resemble it in figure
and swiftness. None of them exhibit that re∣gular
variety of colours, by which the zebra is so
eminently distinguished. This beautiful species
is singular, and very remote from all other kinds.
It likewise belongs to a different climate from
that of the onager, being only found in the ea∣stern
and southern regions of Africa, from Aethiopia
to the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the Cape of Good Hope there are numbers of wild asses, which are the most beautiful in the world. They are finely striped with black and white bands, and are very dif∣ficult to tame; <HI>Relation du Chevalier de Chaumont, p.12.</HI>—The wild ass of the Cape is one of the most beautiful animals I have ever seen.

been brought to these countries from Aethiopia.
In fine, almost all those we have seen in Europe
came from the Cape of Good Hope. This point
of Africa is their native climate, where they are
very numerous, and where the Dutch have ex∣erted
every effort to tame and render them do∣mestic;
but they have not hitherto been able fully
to accomplish this purpose. The zebra, which
was the subject of our description, was extremely
wild when he arrived at the royal menagerie, and
is not yet entirely tamed. They have, however,
brought him the length of being mounted; but
it requires great precaution. Two men hold
the bridle, while a third sits on the animal's back.
His mouth is extremely hard: His ears are so
sensible, that he flings whenever they are touch∣ed,
and, like a vicious horse, he is restless, and as
stubborn as a mule. But the wild horse and the
onager are perhaps equally untractable; and it
is extremely probable, that, if the zebra were
early accustomed to obedience, and to a dome∣stic
state, he would become equally gentle with
the ass and horse, and might supply the place of
both.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="272" REF="312"/>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The ass, either in a domestic or wild state, is
found in almost every warm and temperate cli∣mate
of the Old Continent, and existed not in
the New when it was first discovered. But the
species, after being transported thither from Eu∣rope,
has now subsisted and multiplied greatly in
America, during more than two centuries; so
that, at present, it is almost equally diffused over
the four quarters of the globe. The zebra, on
the contrary, which was brought to us from the
Cape of Good Hope, seems to be a species limit∣ed
to the southern regions of Africa, though
Lopez asserts, that the zebras are more frequent
in Barbary than in Congo, and though Dapper
relates, that troops of them are found in the
forests of Angola.</P>
<P>This beautiful animal, which, both from the
variety of its colours and the elegance of its fi∣gure,
is so superior to the ass, seems, notwith∣standing,
to be nearly of the same species; since
most travellers give it the name of the <HI>striped ass,</HI>
because, at first sight, they were struck with
its superior resemblance, both in size and figure,
to the ass than to the horse; for it was not with
the small common asses that they compared the
zebra, but with the largest and most beautiful of
<PB N="273" REF="313"/>
the species. I am still inclined to think, how∣ever,
that the zebra approaches nearer to the
horse than the ass; for his figure is so elegant,
that though, in general, he is less than the horse,
the similarities between them, in other respects,
are very apparent. To confirm this opinion, it
has been remarked, with some degree of surprise,
that, in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good
Hope, which appears to be the native country of
the true zebra, there are horses spotted on the
back and belly with yellow, black, red, and a∣zure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Robert's voyage, tom. 1. p. 94.</NOTE>.
This particular argument is supported
by the general fact, that, in all climates, the co∣lour
of the horse varies more than that of the
ass. We pretend not to decide this question;
but we hope that it will soon be determined. As
the Dutch have lately transported great numbers
of these elegant animals, and have even yoked
them in the Stadtholder's chariot, it is probable
that, in a short time, we shall receive informa∣tion
of every thing relating to their nature. That
industrious nation cannot fail to make these a∣nimals
unite among themselves, and perhaps
with horses and asses, in order to produce direct
or bastard races. In Holland, there are several
expert naturalists who will perhaps succeed bet∣ter
than we did in the multiplication of the ze∣bra,
upon which only a single experiment was
made at the royal menagerie in the year 1761.
The male, which was four years of age, disdain∣ed
<PB N="274" REF="314"/>
the she-asses, though in season, and no more
were presented to him. Perhaps he was also
too young. Besides, he was not rendered fami∣liar
with the females, a necessary preliminary
for succeeding in the union of different species,
which Nature seems to require even in the in∣tercourse
of individuals of the same species.</P>
<P>The fertile mule of Tartary, called <HI>czigithai,</HI>
may perhaps be an animal of the same species
with the zebra; for there seems to be no differ∣ence
between them, but in colour. Now, it is
well known, that the differences in the colour
of the hair or feathers are extremely slight, and
depend on the influence of the climate. The
czigithai is found in the southern parts of Sibe∣ria,
in Thibet, in Dauria, and in Tartary. Ger∣billon
remarks, that these animals are common
in the country of the Mongoux and Kakas;
that they differ from domestic mules; and that
they cannot be trained to bear burdens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 601.</NOTE>. Mul∣ler
and Gmelin assure us, that they are nume∣rous
in the country of the Tongusians, where
they are hunted like other game; that, in Sibe∣ria,
toward Borsja, they are very plenty in dry
years; and he adds, that they resemble, in fi∣gure,
size, and colour, a bright bay horse, ex∣cept
that they have very long ears<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de M. Muller et Gmelin, tom, 2. p. 105. 107.</NOTE>, and a tail
like that of a cow. If these travellers who ex∣amined
<PB N="275" REF="315"/>
the czigithai had, at the same time,
compared it with the zebra, they would per∣haps
have discovered a greater number of rela∣tions
than we are apt to imagine. In the Pe∣tersburg
cabinet there are stuffed skins both of
the zebra and czigithai. Though these skins
differ in colour, they may belong to the same,
or a very neighbouring species. Time alone
can remove or confirm these conjectures. But,
as all the other animals of Africa are likewise
found in Asia, if the zebra and czigithai are not
of the same species, the zebra alone would be an
exception to this general rule.</P>
<P>Besides, if the czigithai is not the same with
the zebra, it may be the Asiatic animal called
<HI>onager</HI> or <HI>wild ass.</HI> The onager should not
be confounded with the zebra; but I am un∣certain
whether the same remark is applicable
to the onager and czigithai; for, from compa∣ring
the relations of travellers, it appears, that
there are different kinds of wild asses, of which
the onager is the most remarkable. Perhaps
the horse, the ass, the onager, and the czigithai,
constitute four distinct species: And, on the
supposition that they are only three, it is still
uncertain whether the czigithai be an onager
or a zebra. The swiftness of the onager is
mentioned by travellers, who remark, that he
runs with such rapidity as to escape the hunters,
though mounted on horses; and they say the
same thing of the czigithai. However this
<PB N="276" REF="316"/>
matter stands, the horse, the ass, the zebra, and
the czigithai, belong to the same genus, and
constitute three or four branches of the same
family: The two first of which have long been
reduced to a domestic state; which gives us rea∣son
to hope, that the two last may likewise be
tamed, and prove a useful acquisition to man∣kind.</P>

adds to the number of his blunders. It
was not till about the middle of the sixteenth
century that any precise information was ob∣tained
concerning this animal. Belon, being
then at Constantinople, saw a living hippopota∣mus,
of which, however, he gives but an im∣perfect
representation; for the two figures which
he has added to his description were not drawn
from the animal he saw, but were copied from
the reverse of Adrian's medal, and from the E∣gyptian
colossus at Rome. Hence the aera of
any exact knowledge concerning this animal
must be brought forward to the year 1603,
when Federico Zerenghi, a surgeon of Narni in
Italy, printed at Naples the history of two hip∣popotami
which he had taken alive in a great
ditch dug on purpose in the neighbourhood of
the Nile, near Damietta. This little book was
written in Italian; and, though it be the on∣ly.
<PB N="280" REF="322"/>
thing original we have upon this subject, it
seems to have been totally neglected both by
contemporary and succeeding naturalists. The
description it contains of the hippopotamus is, at
the same time, so good, and appears so worthy
of credit, that I shall here give an extract and
translation of it.</P>
<P>“With a view,” says Zerenghi, “of obtaining
an hippopotamus, I stationed men upon the
Nile, who, having seen two of these animals go
out of the river, made a large ditch in the way
through which they passed, and covered it with
thin planks, earth, and herbage. In the even∣ing,
when returning to the river, they both fell
into the ditch. I was immediately informed
of the event, and hastened to the place along
with my Janissary. We killed both the ani∣mals
by pouring three shot into each of their
heads from a large arquebuse. They almost
instantly expired, after uttering a cry which
had more resemblance to the bellowing of
a buffalo, than to the neighing of a horse.
This exploit was performed on the 20th day
of July 1600. The following day, they were
drawn out of the ditch, and carefully skinned.
The one was a male, and the other a female.
I caused their skins to be salted, and stuffed
with the leaves of the sugar cane, in order to
transport them to Cairo, where they were
salted a second time with more attention and
convenience. Each skin required four hun∣dred
pounds of salt. On my return from E∣gypt,
<PB N="281" REF="323"/>
in 1601, I brought these skins to Venice,
and from thence to Rome. I showed them
to several intelligent physicians. Doctor
Jerome Aquapendente and the celebrated Al∣drovandus
were the only persons who recog∣nised
them to be the spoils of the hippopota∣mus;
and, as Aldrovandus's work was then
printing, I allowed him to draw a figure from
the skin of the female, which he inserted in
his book.”</P>
<P>“The skin of the hippopotamus is very thick,
and very hard; it is even impenetrable, un∣less
after being long steeped in water. The
mouth is not, as the antients alledge, of a
middle size, but enormously large. Neither
are his feet divided into two toes, but in∣to
four. His size is not that of an ass;
for he is much larger than the largest horse or
buffalo. His tail resembles not that of a hog,
but rather that of the tortoise, only it is in∣comparably
larger. His muzzle is not turned
up, but resembles that of the buffalo, and is
much larger. He has no mane, but only a
few short, scattered hairs. He neighs not like
a horse; but his voice is a medium between
the bellowing of a buffalo and the neighing
of a horse. He has no tusks which protrude
out of the mouth; for, when the mouth is
shut, the teeth, though extremely large, are all
concealed within the lips…… The inha∣bitants
of this part of Egypt call him <HI>foras
l'bar,</HI> which signifies the <HI>sea horse</HI>…. Be∣lon's
<PB N="282" REF="324"/>
description is very erroneous: He gives
to this animal the teeth of the horse, which
would lead us to think, contrary to his own
assertions, that he had never seen it; for the
teeth of the hippopotamus are very large and
very singular…. To remove every uncer∣tainty”,
continues Zerenghi, “I here give the
figure of the female hippopotamus with all the
dimensions and proportions of the body and
members, drawn exactly according to nature.”</P>
<P>“The length of this hippopotamus, from the
extremity of the upper lip to the origin of the
tail, is nearly eleven feet two inches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This and the following measures are all Paris feet and inches.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“The circumference of the body is about
ten feet.”</P>
<P>“The height, from the sole of the foot to the
top of the back, is four feet five inches.”</P>
<P>“The circumference of the legs, near the

<P>“The height of the legs, from the sole of the
foot to the breast, is one foot ten inches and a

<P>“The length, of the feet, from the extremity
of the nails, is about four inches and a half.”
<HI>Nota.</HI> I have here taken a mean between Ze∣renghi's
two measures for the length of the feet.</P>
<P>“The nails, or divisions of the hoof, are as
long as they are broad, being two inches and
two lines.”</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="325"/>
“Each toe has a nail, and each foot four toes.”</P>
<P>“The skin, on the back, is near an inch, and
that on the belly about seven lines thick.”</P>
<P>“The skin, when dried, is so hard that a
musket ball cannot pierce it. The country
people make large shields of it, and likewise
use it for thongs or whips. On the surface
of the skin there are a few scattered whitish
hairs, which are not perceptible at first sight.
On the neck the hairs are longer, and all of
them placed one by one, at greater or smaller
distances from each other. But, on the lips,
they form a kind of whiskers; for, in several
places, ten or twelve of them issue from the
same point. These hairs are of the same co∣lour
as the others, only they are harder, thick∣er,
and somewhat longer, though none of them
exceeds half an inch in length.”</P>
<P>“The length of the tail is eleven inches four
lines: Its circumference, at the origin, is a
little more than a foot, and, at the extremity,
two inches ten lines.”</P>
<P>“The tail is not round; but, from the middle
to the point, it is flattened, like that of an eel.
Upon the tail and the thighs there are some
round scales, of a whitish colour, and as large
as lentils. These small scales likewise appear
on the breast, the neck, and some parts of the

All these teeth are so
hard, that they strike fire with steel. It is
chiefly the enamel of the canine teeth which
possesses this degree of hardness, the internal

teeth appear without, but are all covered with
the lips, which are extremely large.”</P>
<P>“With regard to the figure of the hippopo∣tamus,
it appears to be a medium between
those of the buffalo and hog, because it parti∣cipates
of both, except the cutting teeth,
<PB N="285" REF="327"/>
which have no resemblance to those of either
of these animals. The grinding teeth have
some similarity to those of the buffalo or horse,
though they are much longer. The colour
of the body is dusky and blackish….. We
are assured that the hippopotamus produces
but one at a time; that he lives upon fishes,
crocodiles, and even cadaverous flesh. He
eats, however, rice, grain, &amp;c. though, if we
consider the structure of his teeth, it would
appear that Nature had not destined him for
pasture, but for devouring other animals.”</P>
<P>Zerenghi finishes his description by inform∣ing
us, that all these measures had been taken
from the female subject, and that the male per∣fectly
resembled her, except that, in all his
dimensions, he was one third larger. It were to
be wished that the figure given by Zerenghi had
been equally good as his description: This ani∣mal,
however, was not drawn from the life, but
from the skin of the female. It likewise ap∣pears,
that Fabius Columna took his figure from
the same skin, which was preserved in salt. But
Columna's description is not equal to that of
Zerenghi; and he even merits reproach for men∣tioning
only the name, and not the work, of this
author, though it was published three years before
his own. For example, Columna remarks, that,
in his time, (1603), Federico Zerenghi brought
from Egypt to Italy an entire hippopotamus,
preserved in salt, though Zerenghi himself tells
<PB N="286" REF="328"/>
us, that he brought only the skin. Columna makes
the body of his hippopotamus thirteen feet long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippopotami a nobis conspecti ac dimensi corpus a capite ad caudam pedes erat tredecim, corporis latitudo five diame∣ter pedes quatuor cum dimidio, ejusdem altitudo pedes tres cum dimidio, ut planum potius quam carinosum ventrem habeat: Orbis corporis quantum longitudo erat: Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra e terra ad ventrem pedes tres cum dimidio: Ambitus crurum pedes tres; pes latus pedem; ungulae singulae uncias tres: caput vero latum pedes d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o cum dimidio, longum pedes tres; crassum ambitu pedes septem cum dimidio: Oris rictus pedem <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>num, &amp;c. Perhaps the foot used by Columna was shorter than the Paris foot. But this circumstance will not justify him; for the body of his hippopotamus being thirteen feet long, its circumference ought to have been only eleven feet seven or eight inches, and not fourteen feet. The other pro∣portions are equally erroneous; for they correspond not with those given by Zerenghi.</NOTE>,
and fourteen feet in circumference, and the legs
three feet and a half in length; while, by the
measures of Zerenghi, the body was only eleven
feet two inches long, its circumference ten feet,
the legs one foot ten inches and a half, &amp;c. We
can have no dependence, therefore, on Colum∣na's
description: Neither can he be excused by
supposing that his description was taken from
another subject; for it is evident, from his own
words, that he described the smallest of Ze∣renghi's
two hippopotami, since he acknowledges,
that, some months afterward, Zerenghi exhibit∣ed
a second hippopotamus, which was much lar∣ger
than the first. I have insisted upon this
point, because no body has done justice to Ze∣renghi,
though he merits the highest eulogiums.
On the contrary, all naturalists, for these hundred
<PB N="287" REF="329"/>
and sixty years, have ascribed to Fabius Colum∣na
what was due to Zerenghi alone; and, in∣stead
of inquiring after the work of the latter,
they have contented themselves with copying
and praising that of Columna, though, with re∣gard
to this article, he is neither original, exact,
nor even honest.</P>
<P>The description and figures of the hippopota∣mus,
which Prosper Alpinus published more than
a hundred years after, are still worse than those
of Columna, having been drawn from ill preser∣ved
skins; and M. Jussieu<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann. 1724. p. 209.</NOTE>, who wrote upon
the hippopotamus in the year 1724, has only
described the bones of the head and feet.</P>
<P>By comparing these descriptions, and especial∣ly
that of Zerenghi, with the information deri∣ved
from travellers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the river Nile there are <HI>hippopotami</HI> or <HI>sea horses.</HI> In the year 1658, one of them was taken at Girge. It was soon brought to Cairo, where I saw it in the month of February of the same year; but it was dead. This animal was of a kind of tawny colour. Behind he resembled the buffalo; but his legs were shorter and thicker. He was as tall as a camel. His muzzle resembled that of an ox; but his body was twice as large. His head was similar to that of a horse, but larger. His eyes were small, his neck very thick, his ears small, his nostrils very large and open, his feet very large, almost round, with four toes on each, like those of the crocodile, and his tail small. Like the elephant, he had little or no hair on the skin. In the under jaw, he had four large teeth, about half a foot in length. Two of them were crooked, and as thick as the horns of an ox. At first, he was mistaken for a sea buffalo. But I, and some others, who had read descrip∣tions of this animal, knew it to be a sea horse. It was brought dead to Cairo by the Janissaries, who shot it on land, where it had come to feed. They poured several shots into it before it fell; for, as I formerly remarked, a musket ball hardly pierces its skin. But one ball entered its jaw, and brought it to the ground. None of these animals had been seen at Cairo for a long time; <HI>Relat. d'un voyage du Levant, par Thevenot, tom. 1. p.</HI> 491.</NOTE>, it appears that the hippo∣potamus
<PB N="288" REF="330"/>
is an animal whose body is longer, and
as thick as that of the rhinoceros; that his legs
are much shorter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The legs of the hippopotamus a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so short, that the belly of the animal, when he walks, is not more t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an four inches above the ground; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> des poissons, p. 17.—Crura e terra ad <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des tres c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n dimidio;</HI> Fabius Columna, p. 31. The testimonies of Belon and Columna, with regard to the length of the legs, differ so widely, than none of their dimensions can be adopted. It must be remarked, that the hippopota∣mus which Belon saw alive, was very young and very fat; that, of course, his belly must have been large and pendulous; that, on the contrary, the skin described by Columna, which was the same with that of Zerenghi, had been dried with salt, and, consequently, Columna could not be certain that the belly of the animal was not <HI>round,</HI> but <HI>flat.</HI> Thus the measures of Belon are too short for an adult hippopotamus, and those of Columna too long for a living one. Hence we may infer from both, that, in general, the belly of this ani∣mal is not above a foot and a half from the ground; and that, as Zerenghi remarks, its legs exceed not two feet in length.</NOTE>; that his head is not so long,
but larger in proportion to his body; that he

of Zerenghi, and augment them one-third;
because these measures were taken from the fe∣male,
which was one-third less than the male in
all its dimensions. This male hippopotamas
was, of course, sixteen feet nine inches long,
from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin
of the tail, fifteen feet in circumference, and six
feet and a half high; and the legs were about
two feet ten inches long. The head was three
feet and a half in length, and eight feet and a

half in circumference. The opening of the
mouth was two feet four inches; and the largest
teeth were more than a foot long.</P>
<P>With such powerful arms, and such prodigi∣ous
strength of body, the hippopotamus might
render himself formidable to all other animals.
But he is naturally mild<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui hippopotamum animal terribile et crudele esse pu∣tarunt, falsi mihi videntur.

lives in it as freely as upon land; yet he has not,
like the beaver or otter, membranes between his
toes. The great size of his belly renders his spe∣cific
gravity nearly equal to that of water, and
makes him swim with ease. Besides, he conti∣nues
long at the bottom of the water<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I have seen the hippopotamus descend to the bottom of three fathoms water, and remain there more than half an hour, before he returned to the surface; <HI>Id. ib.</HI></NOTE>, where

comes out of it to pasture, he eats sugar canes,
rushes, millet, rice, roots, &amp;c. of which he con∣sumes
great quantities, and does much damage
in the cultivated fields. But, as he is more ti∣mid
on land than in the water, it is not difficult
to drive him off. His legs are so short, that,
when at a distance from water, he cannot escape
by flight. When in danger, his only resource is
to plunge into the water, and travel under it a
great way before he again appears. When
hunted, he generally flies; but, when wounded,
he returns with fury, darts boldly against the
boats, seizes them with his teeth, tears pieces off
them, and sometimes sink them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hippopotamus cymbis insidiatur quae mercibus onustae secundo Nigro seruntur, quas dorsi frequentibus gyris agita∣tas demergit; <HI>Leon. Afric. Descript. tom. 2. p.</HI> 758.</NOTE>. “I have
known,” says a traveller<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dampier, vol. 2 part, 2. p. 105.</NOTE>, “the hippopota∣mus
open his mouth, and set one tooth on the
gunnel of a boat, and another on the second
strake from the keel (which was more than
four feet distant), and there bit a hole through
the plank, and sunk the boat; and, after he
had done, he went away shaking his ears. His
strength is incredibly great; for I have seen
him, in the wash of the sore, when the sea
has tossed in a Dutchman's boat with fourteen
hogsheads of water in her, upon the said beast,
<PB N="294" REF="336"/>
and left it dry on his back; and another sea
came and fetched the boat off, and the beast
was not hurt, as far as I could perceive. How
his teeth grow in his mouth I could not see;
only that they were round like a bow, and a∣bout
sixteen inches long; and in the biggest
part more than six inches about. We made
several shot at him; but to no purpose, for
they would glance from him as from a wall.
The natives call him a <HI>kittimpungo,</HI> and say he
is <HI>Tetisso,</HI> which is a kind of a god; for no∣thing,
they say, can kill him: And, if they
should do to him as the white men do, he
would soon destroy their canoes and fishing
nets. Their custom is, when he comes near
their canoes, to throw him fish; and then he
passeth away, and will not meddle with their
fishing craft. He doth most mischief when
he can stand on the ground; but, when afloat,
hath only power to bite. As our boat once
lay near the shore, I saw him go under her,
and with his back lift her out of the water, and
overset her with six men aboard; but, as it
happened, did them no harm. Whilst we lay
in the road, we had three of them, which did
trouble this bay every full and change, and
two or three days after. The natives say, they
go together, two males and one female. Their
noise is much like the bellowing of a large
calf.” These facts are sufficient to give an idea
of the strength of this animal. Many similar
<PB N="295" REF="337"/>
facts are to be found in the general history of
voyages, by the Abbe Prevost, where we have a
complete and judicious collection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 5. p. 95. 330.</NOTE> of all that
has been delivered by travellers concerning the
hippopotamus.</P>
<P>The individuals of this species are not nume∣rous,
and seem to be confined to the rivers of
Africa. Most naturalists tell us, that the hippo∣potamus
is also found in India. But the evi∣dence
they have of this fact appears to be equi∣vocal.

found in Asia. But his relation appears to be
suspicious, and, in my opinion, only proves that
this animal is common in Mosambique, and all
the eastern parts of Africa. At present, the hip∣popotamus,
which the antients called the <HI>horse of

he has sometimes been confounded with the lat∣ter,

Kolbe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>If the epithet <HI>sea</HI> be applied to the hippopotamus or <HI>sea∣horse,</HI> it is not because he is a species of fish, or lives always <HI>in the sea.</HI> He comes upon the dry land in quest of food, and he retires for safety to the <HI>sea</HI> or to a <HI>river.</HI> Herbage is his or∣dinary food. When pressed with hunger, he comes out of the water, in which he lies always in an extended posture. When he raises his head above the water, he looks about on all sides to see if there is any danger, and he scents a man at a considerable distance. If he perceives any thing, he plunges again into the water, where he continues three hours without moving…. He generally weighs from two thousand five hundred to three thousand pounds…. The sea-horse, both in colour and size, resembles the rhinoceros, only his legs are somewhat shorter. His head, as Tellez remarks, (lib. 1, chap. 8.) has a greater resemblance to that of the horse, than to that of any other animal; and, from this circumstance, he has derived his name. His mouth is much larger than that of the horse, and, in this respect, he approaches nearer the ox. His nostrils are very large; and, when he rises to the surface of the river or sea, he squirts the water out of them. His ears and eyes are remarkably small. His legs are short, and of an equal thickness throughout. His hoofs are not divided into two, like those of the ox, but into four parts, on each of which there are spiral furrows. His tail is short like that of the elephant, with a few short hairs on it; and there is no hair on the rest of the body.</P>
<P>The paps of the female hang, like those of the cow, be∣tween the hind legs; but they, as well as the teats, are very small in proportion to the size of the animal. I have often seen the mothers suckling their young, which were then as large as sheep… The skin of the river-horse is more than an inch thick, and so hard that it is difficult to kill him even with musket balls. The Europeans always aim at his head, where the skin is most tender, and easily pierced. This ani∣mal seldom receives a mortal wound in any other part of his body.</P>
<P>The teeth of the under jaw are very remarkable. They are four in number, two on each side, one of them crooked and, the other straight. They are as thick as an ox's horn, about a foot and a half long, and each of them weighs twelve pounds. They are very white, and never turn yellow with age, as ivory does. Hence they are more esteemed than the teeth of the elephant.</P>
<P>The flesh of this animal, whether boiled or roasted, is most delicious. It is so highly valued at the Cape, as to sell at twelve or fifteen pence the pound. The fat sells as dear as the flesh: It is very mild and wholesome, and used instead of butter, &amp;c.; <HI>Descript. du Cap de Bonne Esperance, par Kolbe, tom. 3. ch.</HI> 3.</P></NOTE>, who says he saw several of them at the
<PB N="299" REF="341"/>
Cape of Good Hope, assures us, that they plunge
equally into the sea and the rivers; and the same
<PB N="300" REF="342"/>
thing is advanced by other authors. Though
Kolbe is more exact than usual in his description
of this animal; yet it is doubtful whether he
saw it so frequently as he insinuates; for the fi∣gure
he gives is still worse than those of Colum∣na, Aldrovandus, and Prosper Alpinus, which
were all drawn from stuffed skins. It is easy to
perceive, that the descriptions and figures in
Kolbe's works have not been taken on the spot,
nor drawn from nature. His descriptions are
written from memory, and most of the figures
have been copied from those of other naturalists.
The figure he has given of the hippopotamus
has a great resemblance to the cheropotamus of
Prosper Alpinus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note. The figures of the cheropotami of Prosper Alpi∣nus, <HI>lib. 4. cop. 12. tab.</HI> 22. seem to have been drawn from stuffed skins of hippopotami, from which the teeth appear to have been extracted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence Kolbe, when he tells us that the hip∣popotamus
inhabits the sea, has perhaps copied
Pliny, instead of giving his own observations.
Most authors relate, that this animal is only
found in fresh water lakes, and in rivers, some∣times
near their mouths, but oftener at great
distances from the sea. Some travellers are
astonished that the hippopotamus should have
been called the <HI>sea-horse;</HI> because, as Merollo
<PB N="301" REF="343"/>
remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 5. p. 95.</NOTE>, this animal cannot endure salt water.
He generally remains in the water during the
day, and comes out in the night to pasture.
The male and female seldom separate. Ze∣renghi
caught a male and a female the same
day, and in the same ditch. The Dutch voya∣gers
tell us, that the female brings forth three or
four young at a time. But this fact is rendered
suspicious by the very evidence which Zerenghi
quotes. Besides, as the hippopotamus is of an
enormous size, like the elephant, the rhinoceros,
the whale, and all other large animals, it must
produce but one at a time: This analogy seems
to be more certain than the vague reports of travellers.</P>

<P>M. le Chevalier Bruce assured me, that, in his
travels through Africa, he saw a number of hip∣popotami
in Lake Tzana, which is situated in
Upper Abyssinia, near the true sources of the
Nile; and that, in this lake, which is at least
six leagues long by ten or twelve broad, the
hippopotami are more numerous than in any o∣ther
part of the world. He adds, that he saw
some of them which were twenty feet long, with
very thick short legs.</P>

<HEAD>Addition to the Article Hippopotamus, by Pro∣fessor
Allamand, Editor of the Dutch Edition
of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>To complete the description of the adult hip∣popotamus
given by M de Buffon, nothing is
wanting but a genuine figure of the animal. M.
de Buffon, who is always original, chose not to
copy the figures published by different authors.
They are all too imperfect to be used; and,
with regard to the animal itself, he could not
possibly procure it. Even in its native country,
it is very rare, and too large to be transported
without great expence and trouble. In the ca∣binet
of natural curiosities in the university of
Leyden, there is a stuffed skin of the hippopota∣mus,
which had been sent from the Cape of
Good Hope. Though it had been transmitted
to Holland more than a century ago, it has
been so well preferred, that it still exhibits an
exact representation of the animal. It is sup∣ported
by rings of iron, and by pieces of wood
of such solidity, that drying has produced no
considerable alterations. As it is probably the
only specimen of the kind in Europe, I am per∣suaded
that all lovers of natural knowledge will
thank me for enriching the magnificent work of
M. de Buffon with an exact engraving of it.
The figure I have given represents the ani∣mal
<PB N="303" REF="345"/>
better than any that has hitherto been
drawn, or rather, it is the only figure we have
of it; for, in all the others, the hippopotamus is
not distinguishable, if we except that to be found
in a Dutch book, concerning the Leviathan of
Holy Writ, which was copied from the same
model; but the proportions of the animal are
not accurately observed.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to add a description of this
enormous animal, having no additions to what
has been said of it by M. de Buffon and M. Daubenton.</P>
<P>[As the figure of the young hippopotamus, in the
cabinet of the Prince of Condé, differs from
that which M. Allamand had engraved from the
stuffed skin in the Leyden Cabinet, and as it has
a greater resemblance to a new figure given by
Dr Klockner from another skin in the Prince of
Orange's cabinet, I have here preferred the
latter; and I shall add some remarks of the
same author, which were translated from the
Dutch.]</P>

<HEAD>Addition to M. de Buffon's History of the Hippo∣potamus,
by Dr Klockner of Amsterdam.</HEAD>
<P>I am surprised that M. de Buffon takes no
notice of a passage in Diodorus Siculus, concern∣ing
the hippopotamus, especially as this antient
<PB N="304" REF="346"/>
author remarks, that its voice resembled the
neighing of a horse, which perhaps induced him
to give it the denomination of <HI>hippopotamus</HI> or
<HI>river-horse.</HI> M. de Buffon founded his opini∣on
of this matter upon the testimonies of an∣tient
and modern authors. Diodorus Siculus
ought to have held the first rank among the
former, since he not only travelled into Egypt,
but is justly esteemed to be one of the best hi∣storians of antiquity. The following are the
words of the passage alluded to: “The Nile pro∣duces several animals, of which the crocodile
and hippopotamus merit particular attention.
…. The latter is five cubits in length. His
feet are cloven like those of the ruminating
animals; and in each jaw he has three tusks
larger than those of the wild boar. The
whole mass of his body resembles that of the
elephant. His skin is harder and stronger
than, perhaps, that of any other animal. He
is amphibious, and remains, during the day,
under the water, where he moves and acts in
the same manner as if he were on land, which
he visits in the night, in order to feed on the
herbage of the mountains. If this animal were
more prolific, he would commit great devasta∣tion
on the cultivated fields of Egypt. The
hunting of the hippopotamus requires a num∣ber
of men, who endeavour to pierce him with
iron daggers. They attack him with several
boats joined together, and strike with crooked
<PB N="305" REF="347"/>
harpoons. To some of these hooks they fix a
rope, and then leave the animal to exhaust
himself with struggling and the loss of blood.
His flesh is very hard, and of difficult dige∣stion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diodor, Sicul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1. P. 42. edit. Weselingii.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>This is perhaps the best description of the hip∣popotamus to be found among the antients;
or Diodorus commits not a single error, but
with regard to the number of the animal's toes.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Observations on the mode of preparing the skin of
the Hippopotamus, now in the Prince of
Orange's Cabinet, by Dr Klockner.</HEAD>
<P>I received from the Hague, in a very dry
state, the skin of this hippopotamus, with the
head inclosed within it. The skin had been
first salted, then dried, and afterwards the skin
of a young hippopotamus, (which is likewise in
the Prince's cabinet) steeped in brine, was, in a
moist state, put into the adult skin. After which,
the whole was packed up in coarse cloth, and
transmitted from the Cape of Good Hope to
Holland. The small skin and the head, of
course, produced a disagreeable odour of rancid
grease, which attracted the insects, and they da∣maged
the large skin that was first exposed to
their attacks.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="348"/>
When I diluted the head, it swelled greatly.
The opening of the mouth was more than six∣teen
inches of Amsterdam measure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Amsterdam foot is only ten inches five lines of the French foot.</NOTE>. The up∣per
and under lips were sufficiently large to co∣ver
all the animal's teeth, especially as the infe∣rior
canine teeth are crooked, and slip along the
curvature of the superior, in the form of sciffars,
and pass into a socket formed by the skin of the
lip and the gums. Between the cutting teeth
and the cylindrical grinders, as well as between
the tongue and cutting teeth, there is a smooth
hard skin; and the palate is full of notches or
hollows. The tongue had been cut out…..
The flesh on each side of the head had also been
removed; and the fat which remained was cor∣rupted.
The whole, however, was interspersed
with very strong muscles, and the flesh about
the two lips was red and white, or of the colour
of an ox's tongue.</P>
<P>Immediately behind the inferior canine teeth,
there is a protuberance, which, when the mouth
is shut, fills the space between the canine teeth
and grinders. This opening, though filled, has
contracted one half in drying, as well as the
lips.</P>
<P>Under the ears, and around the auditory pas∣sage,
which is remarkably small, as well as in
the orbits of the eyes, there was a great quantity
of fat.</P>
<P>The ears are placed upon an eminence, and
in such a manner as to form circular folds. The
<PB N="307" REF="349"/>
elevation of the right ear was much diminished
in drying; but it was conspicuous in the left.</P>
<P>We know that the ears of the hippopotamus
are very small. But those of our subject had
been considerably diminished by insects. The
internal part of the ears is garnished with fine
close hair; but there is very little hair on the
outside.</P>
<P>The eyes must have been very small; for the
sockets were uncommonly small in proportion to
the magnitude of the animal. The eyes I placed
in my subject are perhaps larger than nature;
but, when I used smaller ones, they did not seem
to correspond with the animal.</P>
<P>The nostrils slope downward, and have a small
aperture. They are afterwards joined internally by
a small crooked line. When the skin was
dry, it was difficult to perceive these tubes. I
enlarged them a little before the skin was again
dried.</P>
<P>I must here remark, that I only found thirty-two
teeth in this hippopotamus, which accords
not either with Zerenghi's or M. Daubenton's
descriptions. The first says, that he found forty-four
teeth in his subjects; and the second found
thirty-six in the head preserved in the Royal
Cabinet. This difference excited my attention:
But I could perceive no marks of teeth having
fallen out, except one of the cutting teeth, which
seemed to have been broken. There are four
canine teeth placed perpendicularly, eight cut∣ting
teeth, four in the upper jaw, which are per∣pendicular,
<PB N="308" REF="350"/>
and four in the under jaw, placed
horizontally, as may be seen in the figure. Be∣sides,
I found two grinders in each side of the
under jaw, and three teeth, placed before the
grinders, which had the form of kayles. In
each side of the upper jaw, were three grinders,
and two of these cylindrical teeth. Between
these cylindrical teeth, there is a space of about
half an inch.</P>
<P>[I must here remark, fays the Count de Buffon,
that the hippopotamus has commonly thirty-six
teeth, namely, four cutting teeth above, and four
below, and two canine teeth and twelve grinders
in each jaw. This observation has been verified
by three heads, which have long remained in
the Royal Cabinet, and by a fourth head, which
was transmitted to me, in the month of Decem∣ber
1775, by M. de Sartine, secretary of state to
the marine department. The last grinder, at
the bottom of the mouth, is much thicker, broad∣er,
and flatter on the edge, than the other five.
But I am inclined to think that the number of
grinders varies according to the age of the ani∣mal;
and that, instead of twenty-four, we may
sometimes find twenty-eight, and even thirty-two,
which, as Zerenghi remarks, would make
forty-four in all.]</P>
<P>The upper and under lips, continues Dr Klock∣ner,
are garnished, at considerable distances, with
small tufts of hair, which, like pencils, proceed
from one tube. I counted about twenty of them.
<PB N="309" REF="351"/>
I examined a section of one of these tubes with
the microscope, and found seven roots issuing
from one tube. These seven roots afterwards
split, and each gave rise to several hairs, which
formed a kind of pencil.</P>
<P>On the sides of the mouth, toward the lower
part, I saw some fine hairs, which were placed
nearer each other than the former.</P>
<P>Besides, I found here and there upon the body
some scattered hairs; but there were none upon
the legs, flanks, or belly.</P>
<P>The extremity and edges of the tail were
garnished with pencils of hair, like the nose;
but they were a little longer.</P>
<P>I could not discover the sex of this animal.
Near the fundament there was a kind of train∣gular
pinked aperture, about six inches wide,
where I imagined the organs of generation had
been situated; but, as no vestige of them re∣mained,
it was impossible to ascertain the sex.</P>
<P>The skin of the belly, near the hind legs, was
an inch and nine lines thick: Here the insects
had made a hole, which rendered it an easy
matter to measure the thickness. The substance
of the skin was white, cartilaginous, and coria∣ceous;
and, at this place, it was well separated
from the fat and flesh. Higher up, toward the
back, a good deal of the skin had been pared off,
with a view, no doubt, to render it lighter for
carriage. It was for this reason that the skin
<PB N="310" REF="352"/>
about the spine exceeded not an inch in thick∣ness.</P>
<P>The toes were furnished with nails. The skin
between the toes was very wide; and I believe
that the feet of this animal, when alive, were
rather flat than round. The heel, which is
placed high and backward, appeared to be well
adapted for swimming. The hoof, though thick
and hardened, was nevertheless flexible.</P>
<P>The dimensions of this animal were nearly the
same with those of Zerenghi's female hippopo∣tamus,
formerly described.</P>
<P>I was told, that this hippopotamus had advan∣ced
a great way upon land in the territories of
the Cape, and even near the place called the
<HI>Mountains of snow,</HI> when it was shot by Charles
Marais, a peasant of French extraction. This
peasant brought the skin to M. de Piettenberg,
Governour of the Cape, who transmitted it to his
Highness the Prince. I had the relation from
a nephew of C. Marais, who resides in Amster∣dam.
According to the account given by this
man, who had it from the mouth of Marais, the
hippopotamus runs extremely swift, both in
marshy places and on the firm ground. It is for
this reason that the peasants, though excellent
hunters, dare not fire upon him but when he is
in the water. They lie in wait for him about
sunset, when the animal raises his head above
the water, and keeps his small ears in perpetual
agitation, in order to hear if any noise is near.
<PB N="311" REF="353"/>
When any object of prey appears upon the wa∣ter,
he darts upon it like an arrow from a bow.
While the hippopotamus is listening in this
manner, and floating on the surface of the wa∣ter,
the hunters endeavour to shoot him in the
head. The one whose skin I stuffed was shot
between the eye and the right ear; and the
young one, which is also in the Prince's cabinet,
had been shot, or struck with an harpoon, in the
breast, as appears from inspection. When he
feels that he is wounded, he plunges below the
water, and walks or swims till he loses both mo∣tion
and life. Then, by means of about twenty
oxen, he is dragged on shore and dissected. An
adult hippopotamus generally yields about two
thousand pounds of fat, which is salted and sent
to the Cape, where it fells very dear. This fat
or lard is extremely good, and in relish excels
all others. When pressed, it yields a mild oil,
as white as cream. In Africa, it is recommend∣ed
as a sovereign remedy for diseases of the
breast. The quantity of lard derived from an
individual, demonstrates that this animal is of a
surprising weight and magnitude.</P>
<P>Before finishing my remark, I shall here add
some particulars, regarding the natural history
of the hippopotamus, which are not to be found
in the preceding description.</P>
<P>We have seen, that the hippopotamus pro∣bably
derived his name from the resemblance of
his voice to the neighing of a horse. From the
<PB N="312" REF="354"/>
most authentic accounts, however, it appears that
his cry has a greater similarity to that of the ele∣phant,
or to the stammering and indistinct sounds
uttered by deaf persons. Beside this cry, the
hippopotamus, when asleep, makes a kind of
snorting noise, which betrays him at a distance.
To prevent the danger arising from this circum∣stance,
he generally lies among the reeds that
grow upon marshy grounds, and which it is diffi∣cult
to approach.</P>
<P>I can no where find the remark of Marais,
concerning the agility of this animal, confirmed.
We are perpetually assured, on the contrary, that
the hunters choose rather to attack him on land
than in the water, which indicates, that they are
not afraid of his swiftness. According to other
historians, his return to the river is cut off by trees
and ditches; because they know that he uni∣formly
inclines to regain the water, where he
has no other animal to fear, rather than to fight
or fly upon land. The great shark and the
crocodile avoid the hippopotamus, and dare not
engage with him.</P>
<P>The skin of the hippopotamus is so extreme∣ly
hard on the back, the crupper, and the exter∣nal
parts of the thighs and buttocks, that neither
arrows nor musket balls can pierce it. But it
is softer and thinner on the inside of the thighs
and belly, where the hunters endeavour to shoot
him, or to pierce him with a javelin. He is
extremely tenacious of life; and, therefore, they
<PB N="313" REF="355"/>
try to break his legs by large blunderbusses, char∣ged
with iron wedges. When they succeed,
they are full masters of the animal. The Ne∣groes,
who attack the sharks and crocodiles
with long knives and javelins, are afraid of the
hippopotamus, and would perhaps never attempt
to combat him, unless they knew that they could
outrun him. They believe, however, that this
animal has a stronger antipathy to the Whites
than to the Blacks.</P>
<P>The female brings forth on land, where she
suckles her young, and soon teaches it to take
refuge in the water, when the smallest noise is
heard.</P>
<P>The Negroes of Angola, Congo, Elmina, and,
in general, of the whole west coast of Africa,
regard the hippopotamus as one of those infe∣rior
divinities which they call <HI>Fetiches.</HI> They
scruple not, however, to eat his flesh, when they
can procure it.</P>
<P>I am uncertain whether I should here quote
a passage from P. Labat, where he says that the hippopotamus, who is of a very sanguiferous
temperament, knows how to let blood of him∣self.
For this purpose, he remarks, the animal
searches for a sharp-pointed rock, and rubs him∣self
against it, till he makes a sufficient aperture
for the blood to flow. To promote the flux, he
agitates his body; and, when he thinks he has
lost a sufficient quantity, he rolls in the mud in
<PB N="314" REF="356"/>
order to shut up the wound. In this story there
is nothing impossible; but how could P. Labat
discover this singular operation?</P>
<P>Beside the uses to which the skin and teeth
of the hippopotamus are applied, we are assured
that the Indian painters employ the blood of
this animal as one of their colours.</P>

<HEAD>The ELK<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The elk has horns with short beams spreading into large and broad palms, one side of which is plain, the outmost fur∣nished with several sharp snags. It has no brow antlers. The largest horn I have seen is in the house belonging to the Hud∣son's Bay company, and weighed 56 pounds. The length is 32 inches, between tip and tip 34, and the breadth of the palm 13 ½. There is in the same place an excellent picture of an elk, which was killed in the presence of Charles XI. of Sweden, and weighed 1229 pounds. It is a very deformed and seem∣ingly disproportioned beast. A young female, of about a year old, was to the top of the withers 5 feet or 15 hands. The head alone was two feet, and the length of the whole animal, from nose to tail, was about seven feet. The neck was much shorter than the head, with a short, thick, upright mane, of a light brown colour. The eyes were small, the ears one foot long, very broad and flouching, and the nostrils very large. The upper lip was square, hung greatly over the lower, and had a deep fulcus in the middle, so as to ap∣pear almost bisid. The nose was very broad. Under the throat was a small excrescence, from whence hung a long tuft of coarse black hair. The withers were very high, and the fore-feet three feet three inches long. From the bottom of the hoof to the end of the tibia was two feet four inches. The hind legs were much shorter than the fore-legs. The hoofs were much cloven; and the tail is very short, dusky a∣bove, and white beneath. The general colour of the body was a hoary black, but more gray above the face than any where else.

But I shall after∣wards show, that both <HI>machlis</HI> and <HI>alce</HI> apply solely to the elk; and that, though most naturalists believe the <HI>tarandus</HI> of Pliny to be the elk, it is much more probable that he means the rain-deer by this appellation. I acknowledge, however, that the indications of Pliny are so confused, and even false, that it is difficult to determine this point with precision. The commentators upon Pliny, though they had much erudition, were but little versed in natural history; and this is one rea∣son why we find so many obscure and ill interpreted pas∣sages in his writings. The same remark is applicable to the commentators and translators of Aristotle. We shall, there∣fore, endeavour to restore some words which have been changed, and to correct some passages of those two au∣thors that have been corrupted.</NOTE>, who was near∣ly
contemporary with Pausanias, has given some
<PB N="319" REF="362"/>
obscure intimations of the elk and rain-deer un∣der
the appellations of <HI>alce, machlis,</HI> and <HI>tarandus.</HI>
The name <HI>alce,</HI> therefore, cannot be properly
considered as either Greek or Latin; but it ap∣pears
to have been derived from the Celtic lan∣guage,
in which the elk is called <HI>elch</HI> or <HI>elk.</HI>
The Latin name of the rain-deer is still more
uncertain. Several naturalists have thought that it
was the <HI>machlis</HI> of Pliny; because this author,
when speaking of the northern animals, men∣tions,
at the same time, the <HI>alce</HI> and the <HI>machlis;</HI>
the last of which, he remarks, is peculiar to
Scandinavia, and was never seen either at Rome,
or any part of the Roman empire. In Caesar's
Commentaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Est bos in Hercinia silva, cervi figura, cujus a media fronte inter aures unum cornu existit excelsius, magisque di∣rectum his quae nobis nota sunt cornibus: Ab ejus summo sicut palmae ramique late diffunduntur. Eadem est foetminae marisque natura; eadem forma, magnitudoque cornuum; <HI>Jul. Caesar. de bello Gallico: lib 6. Note.</HI> This passage is deci∣sive. The rain-deer, in fact, has brow antlers which seem to form an intermediate horn. His horns are divided into several branches, terminated by large palms; and the female has horns as well as the male. But the females of the elk, the stag, the fallow-deer, and the roe-deer, have no horns. Hence it is apparent, that the animal here pointed out by Caesar, is the rain-deer, and not the elk; especially as, in ano∣ther place, he mentions the elk, under the name of <HI>alce,</HI> in the following terms: Sunt item in Hercinia silva quae appel∣lantur <HI>Alces:</HI> Harum est consimilis capris (<HI>capreis</HI>) figura et varietas pellium: Sed magnitudine paulo antecedunt mutilae quae sunt cornibus et crura sine nodis articulisque habent, ne∣que quietis causa procumbunt.—His sunt arbores pro cubilibus: Ad eas se applicant: Atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt: Quarum ex vestigiis cum est animadversum a venatoribus quo se recipere consueverint, omnes eo loco aut a radicibus subruunt aut abscindunt arbores tantum ut summa species earum stantium relinquatur: Huc cum se consuetudine reclinaverint, infirmas arbores pondere affligunt atque una ipsae concidunt; <HI>de bello Gallico, lib.</HI> 6. I allow that this second passage contains nothing precise but the name <HI>alce;</HI> and to make it apply to the elk, the word <HI>capreis</HI> must be substituted for <HI>capris;</HI> and we must suppose, at the same time, that Caesar had only seen female elks, which have no horns. All the rest is intelligible; for the elk has very stiff limbs, that is, their articulations are very firm and close; and, as the antients believed, that there were animals, such as the elephant, which could neither bend their limbs nor lie down, it is not surprising that they attribute to the elk this fabulous story of the elephant.</NOTE>, however, we find a passage, which
<PB N="320" REF="363"/>
can apply to no other animal than the rain-deer,
and seems to prove that it then existed in the
forests of Germany; and Gaston Phaebus, fif∣teen
centuries after Julius Caesar, seems to speak
of the rain-deer, under the name of <HI>rangier,</HI> as
an animal, which, in his time, existed in the
forests of France. He has even given a good
description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>rangier</HI> or <HI>ranglier</HI> is an animal that resembles the stag; but his horns are larger and much more branched. When hunted, he flies, on account of the great weight on his head. But, after running long, and doubling, he places his buttocks against a tree, to prevent any attack from behind, and bends his head toward the ground. In this situation, the dogs dare not approach him, because his whole body is defended by his horns. If they come behind him, he strikes them whith his heels. The grey-hounds and bull-dogs are ter∣rified when they see his horns. The rangier is not taller than the fallow deer; but he is much thicker. When he rears his horns backward, they cover his whole body. He feeds like the stag or fallow deer, and throws his dung in clusters. He lives very long. The hunters shoot him with arrows, or take him with different kinds of snares. He is fatter than a stag. Like the fallow deer, he follows the stag in the rutting season.</P>
<P>As to the manner of hunting the <HI>rangier</HI> or <HI>ranglier;</HI> when the hunters go in quest of this animal, they should separate the dogs, to prevent his running into the thickest parts of the forest, which are inhabited by the fallow deer and roe∣bucks. He should spread his nets and snares according to the situation of the forest, and lead his hounds through the wood. As the horns of the rangier are high and heavy, few hunters attempt to seize him with hounds; <HI>La Veneric de Jacques Du∣fouilloux, p.</HI> 97.</P></NOTE> of this animal, and of the manner
<PB N="321" REF="364"/>
of hunting him. As his description cannot ap∣ply
to the elk, and as he gives, at the same time,
the mode of hunting the stag, the fallow deer,
the roebuck, the wild goat, the chamois goat,
&amp;c. it cannot be alledged, that, under the article
<HI>rangier,</HI> he meant any of these animals, or that
he had been deceived in the application of the
name. It is apparent, therefore, from these posi∣tive
evidences, that the rain-deer formerly existed
in France, especially in the mountainous parts,
such as the Pyrennees, in the neighbourhood of
which Gaston Phaebus resided, as Lord of the coun∣ty
of Foix; and that, since this period, they have
been destroyed, like the stags, which were formerly
<PB N="322" REF="365"/>
common in this country, and which now exist
not in Bigore, Couserans, nor in the adjacent
provinces. It is certain that the rain-deer is
found only in more northern latitudes. But we
likewise know, that the climate of France was
formerly much moister and colder, on account
of the many forests and marshes which have
since been cut down and drained. From the
Emperor Julian's letter, we learn what was the
rigour of the frost at Paris in his time. The
description he gives of the ice on the Seine is
perfectly the same with what the Canadians tell
us of the ice in the rivers of Quebec. Gaul,
under the same latitude with Canada, was, two
thousand years ago, exactly what Canada is at
present, namely, a climate sufficiently cold to
nourish animals which are now found only in
the more northern regions.</P>
<P>From all these facts, therefore, it is evident,
that the elk and the rain-deer formerly existed
in the forests of Gaul and Germany; and that
the passages in the Commentaries of Caesar can
apply to no other animals. In proportion as
the lands were cleared, and the waters dried up,
the temperature of the climate would become
more mild, these animals, who delight in cold,
would first abandon the flat countries, and retire
to the snowy mountains, where they still sub∣sisted
in the days of Gaston de Foix. The rea∣son
why they are no longer found there is ob∣vious: The heat of the climate has been gra∣dually
<PB N="323" REF="366"/>
augmented by the almost total destruction
of the forests, by the successive lowering of the
mountains, by the diminution of the waters, by
the multiplication of the human race, and by
culture and improvement of every kind. It ap∣pears
likewise, that Pliny has borrowed from
Caesar almost every thing he has said of these
two animals, and that he was the first who in∣troduced
confusion into their names. The <HI>alce</HI>
and the <HI>machlis</HI> he mentions at the same time;
from which we are led to conclude that these
two names denote two different animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several of our most learned naturalists, and particularly Mr Ray, have thought that the <HI>machlis,</HI> being placed so near the <HI>alce,</HI> could be no other than the rain-deer. <HI>Cervus rangifer, the rain-deer; Plinio machlis; Raii synops. quad. p.</HI> 88. Because I am by no means of the same opinion, I have here given a detail of my reasons.</NOTE>. But,
if we consider, 1. That he mentions the <HI>alce</HI> on∣ly
once, without giving any description of it;
2. That he alone employs the word <HI>machlis,</HI>
which is neither Greek nor Latin, but seems to
have been coined<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On the margin of this passage of Pliny, we have <HI>achlin,</HI> instead of <HI>machlin: Fortassis achlin, quod non cubet,</HI> say the commentators. This name, therefore, appears to have been coined on the supposition that the animal cannot lie down. On the other hand, by transposing the <HI>l</HI> in <HI>alce,</HI> they have made <HI>acle,</HI> which differs little from <HI>achlis.</HI> Hence we may still farther conclude, that this word has been corrupted by the transcribers, especially as we find <HI>alcem,</HI> instead of <HI>mach∣lin,</HI> in several antient manuscripts.</NOTE>, and, according to his com∣mentators,
is changed into <HI>alce</HI> in several an∣tient
manuscripts; 3. That he attributes to the
<HI>machlis</HI> all that Julius Caesar has said of the
<PB N="324" REF="367"/>
<HI>alce;</HI> the passage of Pliny must unquestionably
have been corrupted, and those two names must
denote the same animal, namely the <HI>elk.</HI> The
decision of this question will resolve another.
As the <HI>machlis</HI> is the <HI>elk,</HI> the <HI>tarandus</HI> must be
the <HI>rain-deer.</HI> The name <HI>tarandus</HI> is found in
no other author before Pliny, and has given
rise to various interpretations. Agricola and
Elliot, however, have not hesitated to apply it to
the rain-deer; and, for the reason above assign∣ed,
we willingly subscribe to their opinion. Be∣sides,
we should not be surprised at the silence
of the Greeks, nor at the ambiguity with which
the Latins have mentioned these animals; since
the northern regions were absolutely unknown
to the former, and the latter had all their in∣formation
concerning them from the relations
of others.</P>
<P>Now, in Europe and Asia, the elk is found
only on this side, and the rain-deer beyond the
Polar circle. In America, we meet with them
in lower latitudes; because there the cold is
greater than in Europe. The rain-deer, being
able to endure the most excessive cold, is found
in Spitzbergen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In every part of Spitzbergen, the rain-deer are found, but particularly in <HI>Rehen-feld,</HI> a place which received its name from the number of rain-deer it produces. They are also very numerous in Foreland near Muscle-Haven.—We arrived in this country in the spring, and killed some rain-deer, which were very meager; from which circumstance we conclude, that, notwithstanding the unfertility and coldness of Spitzbergen, these animals make a shift to pass the winter there, and to live upon the small quantity of food they can procure; <HI>Recueil des Voyages au Nord, tom. 2. p.</HI> 113.</NOTE>; he is also very common in Green∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Captain Craycott, in the year 1738, brought a male and a female rain-deer from Greenland to London; <HI>Edward's Hist. of birds, p.</HI> 51. where we have a description and figure of this animal under the name of the <HI>Greenland fallow-deer,</HI> which, as well as the <HI>Greenland roebuck,</HI> or <HI>Caprea Groenlendica,</HI> mentioned by Grew, in his description of the museum of the royal society, can be nothing else but the rain-deer. Both these authors, in their descriptions, mention, as a peculiar character, the down with which the horns of these animals were covered. This character, however, is common to the rain-deer, the ftag, the fallow deer, and all the deer kind. This hair or down countinues on the horns during the summer-season, which is the time when they are growing, and the only time that ves∣sels can sail to Greenland, It is not, therefore, surprising that, during this season, the horns of the rain-deer should be covered with down. Hence this character is of no import∣ance in the descriptions given by these authors.</P>

From the middle of each a small branch issues, which divides, like those of the stag, into several antlers that stretch forward, and, by their figure and situation, might pass for a third horn, though it frequent∣ly happens that the large horns push out similar branches from their own trunks: Thus another small branch advances toward the front, and then the animals seem to have four horns, two behind like the stag, and two before, which las is peculiar to the rain-deer. The horns of the rain-deer are also sometimes disposed in the following manner; two bend backward, two smaller ones mount upward, and two still smaller bend forward, being all furnished with antlers, and having but one root. Those which advance toward the front, as well as those which mount upward, are, properly speaking, only branches or shoots of the large horns which bend back∣ward like those of the stag. This appearance, however, is not very common; we more frequently see rain-deer with three horns, and the number of those with four, as formerly described, is still greater. All this applies only to the males; for the horns of the females are smaller, and have not so many branches; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 306.</NOTE>, each
of which is terminated by a palm: But those of
the elk have the appearance of being cut off ab∣ruptly,
and are furnished with broaches. Both

ears much longer than those of the stag. Their
<PB N="330" REF="373"/>
motion consists not of bounds or leaps, like the
slag and roebuck: It is a kind of trot, but so
quick and nimble, that they will pass over near∣ly
the same ground in an equal time, without
being fatigued; for they will continue to trot in
this manner during a whole day, or even two
days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The orignal neither runs nor bounds; but his trot equals the course of the stag. We are assured by the Savages, that he may be trotted three days and three nights without rest∣ing; <HI>Voyage it la Hontan, tom. 1. p.</HI> 85.</NOTE>. The rain-deer keeps always on the
mountains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rangifer habitat in alpibus Europae et Asiae, maxima septentrionalibus; victitat lichene rangifero …. Alces ha∣bitat in borealibus Europae Asiaeque populetis; <HI>Linn. Syst. Nat. p.</HI> 67.</NOTE>; and the elk inhabits low grounds
and moist forests. Both go in flocks like the
stag; and both may be tamed; but the rain-deer
is more easily tamed than the elk. The
latter, like the stag, has never lost its liberty.
But the rain-deer has been rendered domestic by
the most stupid of the human race. The Lap∣landers
have no other cattle. In this frozen
climate, which receives only the most oblique
rays of the sun, where the night and the day
constitute two seasons, where the earth is cover∣ed
with snow from the beginning of autumn to
the end of spring, where the bramble, the juni∣per,
and the moss, constitute the only verdure of
the summer, man can never hope to nourish
cattle. The horse, the ox, the sheep, and all
our other useful animals, could never find sub∣sistence
<PB N="331" REF="374"/>
there, nor be able to resist the rigours of
the frost. It would have been necessary to se∣lect
from the deepest forests those species of ani∣mals
which are least wild and most profitable.
The Laplanders have actually done what we
would be obliged to do, if all our cattle were
destroyed. To supply their place, it would then
be necessary to tame the stags and roebucks of
our woods, and to render them domestic. This
end, I am persuaded, might be easily accomplish∣ed
and we would soon derive as much benefit
from these animals, as the Laplanders do from
their rain-deer. This example should lead us
to admire the unbounded liberality of Nature.
We use not one half of the treasures she presents
to us; for her resources are inexhaustible. She
has given us the horse, the ox, the sheep, and
other domestic animals, to serve, to nourish, and
to clothe us; and she has other species still in
reserve, which might supply the want of the
former: These we have only to subdue, and to
render them subservient to our purposes. Man
is equally ignorant of the powers of Nature, and
of his own capacity to modify and improve her
productions. Instead of making new researches,
he is continually abusing the little knowledge
he has acquired.</P>
<P>By estimating the advantages the Laplanders
derive from the rain-deer, we shall find that this
animal is worth two or three of our domestic
animals. They use him as a horse in drawing
<PB N="332" REF="375"/>
sledges and carriages. He is so nimble and ex∣peditious,
that in one day he performs with ease
a journey of thirty leagues, and runs with equal
sureness on the frozen snows as upon the finest
downs. The milk of the female affords a more
substantial nourishment than that of the cow.
The flesh of this animal is exceedingly good.
His hair makes excellent furs; and his skin is
convertible into a very strong and pliant leather.
Thus the rain-deer alone furnishes every article
we derive from the horse, the ox, and the sheep.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Laplanders rear
and manage the rain-deer, merits particular at∣tention.
Olaus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de gentibus septent. autore Olao Magno, p. 205.</NOTE>, Scheffer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Histoire de la Lapponie, tradnite du Latin de Jean Schef∣ffer, p. 205.</NOTE>, and Regnard<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 172.</NOTE>,
have given interesting details on this subject, of
which the following is an abridged view. These
authors tell us, that the horns of the rain-deer
are much larger, and divided into a greater num∣ber
of branches than those of the stag. During
winter, the food of this animal is a white moss,
which he knows how to find under the deepest
snow, by digging with his horns, and turning it
aside with his feet. In summer, he prefers the
buds and leaves of trees to herbs, which the pro∣jecting
branches of his horns permit him not to
brouse with ease. He runs on the snow, into
which the breadth of his feet prevents him from
<PB N="333" REF="376"/>
sinking. …… These animals are extremely
gentle, and are kept in flocks, which bring great
profits to their owners. The milk, the skin, the
sinews, the bones, the hoofs, the horns, the hair,
the flesh, are all useful articles. The richest
Laplanders have flocks of four or five hundred;
and the poorest have ten or twelve. They are
led out to pasture, and, during the night, they
are shut up in inclosures, to protect them from
the wolves. When carried to another climate,
they soon die. Steno Prince of Sweden sent
some of them to Frederic Duke of Holstein;
and, more recently, in the year 1533, Gustavus
King of Sweden transmitted to Prussia ten male
and female rain-deer, which were let loose in the
woods. They all perished without producing,
either in the domestic or free state. “I had
a great desire,” says M. Regnard, “to carry some
live rain-deer to France. This experiment
has been frequently tried in vain. Last year,
some of them were brought to Dantzick,
where, being unable to endure the heat of that
climate, they perished.”</P>
<P>In Lapland there are both wild and domestic
rain-deer. During the rutting season, the fe∣males
are let loose into the woods, where they
meet with wild males; and, as the latter are
stronger and more hardy than the domestic kind,
the breed from this commixture is better adapt∣ed
for drawing sledges. These rain-deer are
not so mild as the others; for they sometimes
<PB N="334" REF="377"/>
not only refuse to obey their master, but turn
against him, and strike him so furiously with
their feet, that his only resource is to cover him∣self
with his sledge, till the rage of the animal
abates. This carriage is so light, that a Lap∣lander
can turn it with ease-above himself. The
bottom of it is covered with the skins of young
rain-deer, the hair of which is turned backward,
to make the sledge advance easily up the moun∣tains,
and prevent its recoiling. The rain-deer
is yoked by means of a collar, made of a piece
of skin with the hair on it, from which a trace is
brought under the belly between the legs, and
fixed to the fore part of the sledge. The only
rein used by the Laplander is a cord tied to the
root of the animal's horn, which he sometimes
lays upon the one side of its back, and sometimes
on the other, according as he wants it to turn to
the right or the left. The rain-deer can travel,
in this manner, at the rate of four or five leagues
in an hour. But the quicker he goes, the mo∣tion
becomes the more incommodious; and it
requires much practice to be able to sit in the
sledge, and to prevent it from over-turning.</P>
<P>Externally, the rain-deer have many things
in common with the stag; and the structure of
their internal parts is nearly the same<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rangifer. anatom. Barth. Act. 1671. No. 135.</NOTE>. From
this natural conformity, many analogous habits
and similar effects result. Like the stag, the
rain-deer annually casts his horns, and is loaded
<PB N="335" REF="378"/>
with fat. The rutting season of both is about
the end of September. The females of both spe∣cies
go eight months with young, and pro∣duce
but one fawn. During the rutting season,
the males have an equally disagreeable odour;
and some of the female rain-deer, as well as the
hinds, are barren<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Out of a hundred females, not above ten are barren, and, on account of their sterility, are called <HI>raones.</HI> The flesh of these is very fat and succulent in autumn; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 204.</NOTE>. The young rain-deer, like
the fawns of the stag, are variously coloured, be∣ting
first red mixed with yellow, and afterwards
become of a blackish brown colour<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The colour of their hair is blacker than that of the stag…. The wild rain-deer are always stronger, larger, and blacker than the domestic kind; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 108.</NOTE>. The
young follow their mothers two or three years;
and they acquire not their full growth till the
end of the fourth year. It is at this age also that
they are trained to labour. At the age of one
year, they are castrated in order to make them
tractable. The Laplanders perform this opera∣tion
with their teeth. The uncastrated males
are fierce, and very difficult to manage; and,
therefore, are not used for labour. To draw
their sledges, the most active and nimble geld∣ings
are selected, and the heaviest are employed
in carrying provisions and baggage. One un∣mutilated
male is kept for every five or six fe∣males.
Like the stags, they are tormented with
worms, in the bad season. About the end of
winter, such vast numbers are engendered under
<PB N="336" REF="379"/>
their skin, that it is as full of holes as a sieve.
These holes made by the worms close in sum∣mer;
and it is only in autumn that the rain-deer
are killed for their fur or their hide.</P>
<P>The flocks of rain-deer require much atten∣tion.
They are apt to run off, and to assume
their natural liberty. They must he followed
and narrowly watched, and never allowed to
pasture but in open places. When the flock
is numerous, the assistance of several persons is
necessary to keep them together, and to pursue
those which run off. In order to distinguish
them, when they wander into the woods, or
mingle with other flocks, they are all marked.
In fine, the time of the Laplanders is totally
consumed in the management of their rain-deer,
which constitute their whole riches, and they
know how to derive all the conveniences, or ra∣ther
the necessities of life from these animals.
They are covered from head to foot with their
furs, which is impenetrable either by cold or
water. This is their winter habit. In summer,
they use the skins from which the hair is fallen
off. They likewise spin the hair, and cover the
sinews they extract from the animal's body with
it. These sinews serve them fore ropes and
thread. They eat the flesh, and drink the milk,
of which last they also make very fat cheese.
The milk, when churned, instead of butter, pro∣duces
a kind of suet. This singularity, as well
as the great extent of the horns, and the fatness of
<PB N="337" REF="380"/>
the animal at the commencement of the rutting
season, are strong indications of a redundance of
nourishment. But we have still farther proofs
that this redundance is excessive, or at least
greater than in any other species; for it is pecu∣liar
to the rain-deer alone, that the female has
horns as well as the male, and that, even when
the males are castrated, they annually shed; and
renew their horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Uterque sexus cornibus est.—Castratus quotannis cornua deponit; <HI>Linn. syst. nat. p.</HI> 93. It is upon the autho∣rity of Linnaeus alone that I have advanced this fact, of which I am unwilling to doubt; because, being a native of Sweden, and having travelled into Lapland, he had an op∣portunity of being well informed in every article regarding the rain-deer. I acknowledge, however, that the exception is singular, as in all other animals of the deer-kind, castration prevents the renewal of the horns. Besides, a positive testi∣mony may be opposed to Linnaeus. <HI>Castratis rangifetris Lap∣pones utuntur. Cornua castratorum non dicidunt, el cum hirsuta sunt, semper pilis luxuriant;</HI> Hulden, Rangifer. Jenae 1697. But Hulden, perhaps, advances this fast from analogy on∣ly; and the authority of such a skillful naturalist as Linnaeus is of more weight than the testimonies of many people who are less informed. The known fact, that the female has horns like the male, is another exception which gives support to the first; and it is still further supported by the practice a∣mong the Laplanders of not cutting away the testicles, but only compressing the seminal vessels with their teeth; for, in this case, the action of the testicles, which seems necessary to the production of horns, is not totally destroyed, but only weakened.</NOTE>. In the stag, the fallow-deer,
and the roebuck, who have undergone this opera∣tion,
the horns remain always in the same condition
they were at the time of castration. Thus, of all
other animals, the rain-deer affords the most con∣spicuous
<PB N="338" REF="381"/>
example of redundant nutritive matter;
and this effect is perhaps less owing to the na∣ture
of the animal than to the quality of his
food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See article <HI>Stag,</HI> vol. IV.</NOTE>; for the substance of the <HI>lichen,</HI> or rain-deer
liverwort, which is its only nourisment,
especially during the winter, is similar to that of
the mushroom, very nourishing, and contains a
greater number of organic particles than the
leaves or buds of trees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that, though the rain-deer eats nothing, during winter, but great quantities of this moss, he always fattens better, his skin is cleaner, and his hair finer than when he feeds upon the best herbage, at which time they make a hide∣ous appearance. Their being unable to enduce heat is the reason why they are better and fatter in autumn and winter, than in summer, when they have nothing but sinews, skin, and bone; <HI>Scheffer, hist, de la Lapponie, p,</HI> 206.</NOTE>. This is the reason
why the rain-deer has larger horns and a great∣er
quantity of fat than the stag, and why the fe∣males
and geldings are not deprived of horns: It
is also the reason why the horns of the rain-deer
are more diversified in size, figure, and number
of branches, than any other of the deer kind.
Those males who have never been hunted or
restrained, and who feed plentifully, and at their
ease, upon this substantial nourishment, have
prodigious horns, which extend backward as
far as their crupper, and forward beyond the
muzzle. The horns of the castrated males,
though smaller, often exceed those of the stag;
and those of the females are still smaller. Thus the
<PB N="339" REF="382"/>
horns of the rain-deer are not only subject to
variation from age, like others of the deer-kind,
but from sex and castration. These differences
are so great, in the horns of different individuals,
that it is not surprising to see the descriptions
given of them by authors so exceedingly different.</P>
<P>Another singularity, which is common to the
rain-deer and the elk, must not be omitted.
When these animals run, though not at full
speed, their hoofs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rangiferum culex pipiens, oestrus tarandi, tabanus, tarandi ad alpes cogunt, crepitantibus ungulis; <HI>Linn. syst. nat. p.</HI> 93.—The feet of the rain-deer are shorter and much broader than those of the stag, and resemble the feet of the buffalo. The hoofs are cloven and almost round, like those of the ox. Whether he runs or goes slowly, the joints of his limbs make a great noise, like flints falling on each other, or like the breaking of nuts. This noise is heard as far as the animal can be seen; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 202.—Fragor ac strepitus pe∣dum, ungularumque tantus est in celeri progressu, ac si silices vel nuces collidantur; qualem strepitum articulorum etiam in alce observavi.—It is remarkable in the rain-deer, that all his bones, and particularly those of his feet, make a crackling noise, which is so loud as to be heard as far as the animal can be seen; <HI>Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 108.</NOTE>, at each movement, make
a crackling noise, as if all their limbs were dis∣jointed.
The wolves, advertised by this noise,
or by the odour of the animal, throw themselves
in his way, and, if numerous, they seize and
kill him; for a rain-deer defends himself against
the attacks of a single wolf. For this purpose
he employs not his horns, which are more hurt∣ful
than ufeful to him, but his fore-feet, which
are very strong. With these he strikes the wolf
<PB N="340" REF="383"/>
so violently as to stun him, or make him fly off;
and afterwards runs with a rapidity that pre∣vents
all farther attacks. The <HI>rosomack</HI> or <HI>glut∣ton,</HI>
though not so numerous, is a more dange∣rous
enemy. This animal is still more voraci∣ous,
but not so nimble as the wolf. He pursues
not the rain-deer, but lies in wait for it conceal∣ed
in a tree. As soon as the rain-deer comes
within his reach, he darts down upon it, fixes
upon its back with his claws; and, tearing its
head or neck with his teeth, he never quits his
station till he has cut the animal's throat. He
employs the same artifices, and carries on the
same war against the elk, which is still stronger
than the rain-deer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another animal, of a grayish brown colour, and about the size of a dog, which carries on a bloody war a∣gainst the rain-deer. This animal, which the Swedes call <HI>Jaert</HI> and the Latins <HI>Gulo,</HI> conceals itself in the highest trees, in order to surprise its prey. When he discovers a rain-deer, whether wild or domestic, passing under the tree where he is watching, he darts down upon its back, and, fixing his claws in the neck and tail, he tears and stretches with such violence as to break the animal's back, then sinks his muzzle into its body, and drinks its blood. The skin of the jaert is very fine and beautiful, and has even been compared to that of the sable; <HI>Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 154.—The caribou runs upon the snow almost as nimbly as upon the ground; because the broadness of its feet prevents it from sinking.

with the orignal of Canada are famous;
and, as formerly remarked, the orignal of Cana∣da
is the same with the elk of Europe. It is
remarkable, that this animal, which is not larger
than a badger, should kill the elk, which exceeds
the size of a horse, and is so strong as to slay a
wolf with a single stroke of his, foot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lupi et ungulis et cornibus vel interimuntur vel effugan∣tur ab alce; tanta enim vis est in ictu ungulae, ut illico tractum lupum interimat aut fodiat, quod saepius in canibus robus∣tissimis venatores experiuntur; <HI>Olai Magni hist. de gent. septent. p.</HI> 135.</NOTE>.

The carcajou, observing the route of the orignal, climbs a tree near a place where it must pass, darts upon it, and cut its throat in a moment. In vain the orignal lies down on the ground, or rubs himself against the trees; for nothing can make the carcajou quit his hold. The hunters have found pieces of his skin, as large as a man's hand, sticking on the tree against which the orignal had dashed him; <HI>Hist. de l'Acad. des Sciences, année, 1707, p.</HI> 13.</NOTE>.</P>

The elk and the rain-deer are both rumina∣ting
animals, as appears from their manner of
feeding, and the structure of their intestines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elk, in its internal parts, and particularly in its bowels, and four stomachs, has a considerable resemblance to the ox; <HI>Mem. pour servir à l'histoire des animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 184.</NOTE>;

But it is probable, that, in a wild state,
he lives much longer; for, as he is four years
in acquiring his full growth, he ought, when in
his natural state, to live twenty-eight or thirty
years. The Laplanders employ different me∣thods
of hunting the wild rain-deer, correspond∣ing
to the difference of seasons. In the rutting
time, they use domestic females to attract wild
males<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Laplanders hunt the rain-deer with nets, halberds, arrows, and muskets. The hunting seasons are autumn and spring. In autumn, when the rain-deer are in season, the Laplanders go to those places of the forests which they know the wild males frequent, and there tie domestic females to the trees. The female attracts the male, and, when he is at the point of covering her, the hunter shoots him with a bullet or an arrow.—In spring, when the snow begins to melt, and those animals are embarassed by sinking in it, the Laplander, shod with his rackets, pursues and overtakes them.—At o∣ther times, they are chaced into snares by dogs. In fine, a kind of nets are employed, which are composed of stakes wat∣tled together in the form of two hedges, with an alley be∣tween them of perhaps two leagues in length. When the rain-deer are pushed into this alley, they run forward and fall into a large ditch made with that view at the end of it; <HI>Schef∣fer, p.</HI> 209.</NOTE>. They shoot these animals with mus∣kets
or with bows, and they let fly their arrows
with such violence, that, notwithstanding the
great thickness and strength of their skin, one
is generally fatal.</P>
<P>We have collected the facts relating to the
history of the rain-deer with the more care and
<PB N="344" REF="387"/>
circumspection, because it was not possible for
us to procure the live animal. Having expres∣sed
my regret on this subject to some of my
friends, Mr Collinson, member of the royal so∣ciety
of London, a man as respectable for his
virtues as for his literary merit, was so obliging
as to send me a drawing of the skeleton of a
rain-deer; and I received from Canada a foetus
of a caribou. By means of these two, and of
several horns which were transmitted to us from
different places, we have been enabled to mark
the general resemblances and principal differences
between the rain-deer and the stag.</P>
<P>With regard to the elk, I saw one alive about
fifteen years ago. But, as it continued only a
few days in Paris, I had not sufficient time to
have the drawing completed; and, therefore, I
was obliged to content myself with examining
the description formerly given of this animal
by the gentlemen of the academy, and to be sa∣tisfied
that it was exact, and perfectly conform∣able
to nature.</P>
<P>“The elk,” says the digester of the Memoirs
of the Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem pour servir á l'histoire des animaux, part 1. p. 178.</NOTE>, “ is remarkable for the length
of its hair, the largeness of its ears, the small∣ness
of its tail, and the form of its eye, the
largest angle of which is much split, as well
as the mouth, which is much larger than that
of the ox, the stag, or other cloven footed a∣nimals.
<PB N="345" REF="388"/>
…. The elk which we dissected
was nearly of the size of a stag. The length
of the body was five feet and a half from
the end of the muzzle to the origin of the
tail, which was only two inches long. Be∣ing

was only nine inches in length, and as much
in breadth. The ears were nine inches long

was not much different from that of the ass,
the gray colour of which sometimes approaches
to that of the camel…..In other respects,
this hair differed greatly from that of the ass,
which is shorter, and from that of the camel,
which is much finer. The length of the hair
was three inches, and equalled in thickness
the coarsest hair of a horse. This thickness
diminished gradually toward the extremity,
which was very sharp: It diminished like∣wise
toward the root, but suddenly became
like the handle of a lancet. This handle was
of a different colour from the rest of the hair,
being white and diaphanous, like the bristles
of a hog…..The hair was as long as that
of a bear, but straighter, thicker, smoother,
and all of the same kind. The upper lip was
large and detached from the gums, but by no
means so large as Solinus described it, nor as
Pliny has represented the animal he calls
<HI>machlis.</HI> These authors tell us, that this crea∣ture
is obliged to go backward when he pas∣tures,
to prevent his lip from being entangled
<PB N="346" REF="389"/>
between his teeth. We remarked, in the dis∣section,
that Nature had provided against this
inconveniency by the largeness and strength
of the muscles destined to raise the upper lip.
We likewise found the articulations of the legs
closely embraced by ligaments, the hardness
and thickness of which might give rise to the
opinion, that the <HI>alce,</HI> after lying down, was
unable to raise himself…. His feet were
similar to those of the stag; only they were
larger, and had no other peculiarity…….
We remarked, that the large angle of the eye
was much more slit below than in the stag,
the fallow deer, and the roebuck: It is sin∣gular,
that this slit was not in the direction
of the opening of the eye, but made an angle
with the line which goes from the one corner
of the eye to the other; the inferior lachrymal
gland was an inch and a half long, by seven
lines broad…….. In the brain we found
a part whose magnitude seemed to point out
some relation to the sense of smelling, which,
according to Pausanias, is more exquisite in the
elk than in any other animal; for the olfac∣tory
nerves, commonly called the <HI>mammillary
processes,</HI> were incomparably larger than in any
other animal we ever dissected, being
more than four lines in diameter…… With
regard to the lump of flesh which some au∣thors
have placed on his back, and others un∣der
his chin, if they have not been deceived
<PB N="347" REF="390"/>
or too credulous, it must be peculiar to the elks
they mention.” We can add our testimony
to that of the gentlemen of the Academy; for,
in the female elk we had alive, there was no
bunch either under the chin, or on the neck.
Linnaeus, however, as he lives in the country
inhabited by elks, and ought to have a more com∣plete
knowledge of them than we can pretend to,
mentions this bunch on the neck, and even
makes it an essential character of the elk: <HI>Alces,
cervus cornibus acaulibus palmatis, caruncula gut∣turali;
Linn. Syst. Nat. p.</HI> 92. There is no o∣ther
method of reconciling the assertion of Lin∣naeus
with our negative evidence, but by sup∣posing
this bunch, <HI>guttural caruncle,</HI> to be pecu∣liar
to the male, which we have never seen.
But, though this were the case, Linnaeus ought
not to have made it an essential character of the
species, since it exists not in the female. This
bunch may likewise be a disease, a kind of wen,
common among the elks; for, in Gesner's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gesner, hist. quad. p. 1. &amp; 3.</NOTE>
two figures of this animal, the first, which wants
horns, has a large fleshy bunch on the throat;
and, in the second, which represents a male with
his horns, there is no bunch.</P>
<P>In general, the elk is much larger arid stron∣ger
than the stag or rain-deer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The elk exceeds the rain-deer in magnitude, being equal to the largest horse. Besides, the horns of the elk are much shorter, about two palms broad, and have very few branches. His feet, especially those before, are not round, but long, and he strikes with them so furiously as to kill both men and dogs. Neither does he more resemable the rain-deer in the form of his head, which is longer, and his lips are large and pendu∣lous. His colour is not so white as that of the rain-deer, but, over the whole body, it is an obscure yellow, mixed with a cinereous gray. When he moves, he makes no noise with his joints, which is common to all rain-deer. In fine, whoever ex∣amines both animals, as I have often done, will remark so many differences, that he will have reason to be surprised how any man should regard them as the same species; <HI>Scheffer, p.</HI> 310.</NOTE>. His hair is so
<PB N="348" REF="391"/>
rough, and his skin so hard, that it is hardly
penetrable by a musket ball<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alces ungula ferit, quinquaginta milliaria de die percur∣rit, corium globum plumbeum fere eludit; <HI>Linn. Syst. Nat. p.</HI> 93.</NOTE>. His limbs are
extremely firm, and possess such agility and
strength, that, with the single blow of his fore∣feet,
he can slay a man, or a wolf, and even
break a tree. He is hunted, however, by men
and dogs, in the same manner as the stag. We
are assured, that, when pursued, he often falls
down suddenly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We had not advanced a pistol-shot into the wood, when we descried an elk, which, when running before us, suddenly dropped down, without being so much as fired at. We asked our guide and interpreter how the animal came to fall in this manner. He replied, that it was the falling sickness, to which these animals are subject, and assigned that as the rea∣son of their being named <HI>ellends,</HI> which signifies <HI>miserable</HI>… If this disease did not often bring them down, it would be difficult to seize them. The Norwegian gentleman killed this elk while it was under the influence of its disease. We pursued another two hours, and would never have taken him, if he had not, like the first, fallen down, after having killed three strong dogs with his fore-feet…. This gentleman present∣ed me with the left hind feet of the elks he had killed, and told me they were a sovereign remedy against the falling sick∣ness. To which I answered, smiling, that, since this foot had so much virtue, I was surprised that the animal to which it belonged should ever be afflicted with the disease. The gentle∣man likewise laughed, and said that I was right; that he had seen it administered without effect to many people who were troubled with the epilepsy; and that he knew, as well as I did, that it was a vulgar error; <HI>Voyage de la Martiniere, p.</HI> 10.</NOTE>, without being either shot or
<PB N="349" REF="392"/>
wounded. From this circumstance it has been
presumed that the animal is subject to the epi∣lepsy;
and from this presumption (which is not
well founded, since fear might produce the same
effect) the absurd conclusion has been drawn,
that his hoofs have the power of curing, and
even preventing, the falling sickness. This gross
prejudice has been so generally diffused, that
many people still carry pieces of the elk's hoof
in the collets of their rings.</P>
<P>As the northern parts of America are very thinly
inhabited, all the animals, and particularly the
elks, are more numerous there than in the North
of Europe. The Savages are not ignorant of the
art of hunting and seizing the elks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. de I'Amerique, par Denys, tom. 2. p. 425.</NOTE>. They some∣times
follow the tract of these animals for seve∣ral
days, and, by mere perseverance and address,
accomplish their purpose. Their mode of hunting
in winter is particularly singular. “They use,”
says Denys, “rackets, by means of which they
walk on the snow without sinking…. The
orignal does not make much way, because he
sinks in the snow, which fatigues him. He
<PB N="350" REF="393"/>
eats only the annual shoots of trees. Where
the Savages find the wood eaten in this man∣ner,
they soon meet with the animals, which
are never very distant, and are easily taken,
because they cannot run expeditiously. They
throw darts at them, which consist of large
staves, pointed with a bone, which pierces like
a sword. When there are many orignals in a
flock, the Savages put them to flight. The
orignals, in this case, march at one another's
tails, and make a circle sometimes of more
than two leagues, and, by their frequent turn∣ing
round, tread the snow so hard, that they
no longer sink in it. The Savages lie in am∣buscade,
and kill the animals with darts as they
pass.” From comparing this relation with those
already quoted, it is apparent, that the American
Savage and the orignal are exact copies of the
European Laplander and the elk.</P>

<HEAD>Addition to the article Elk and Rain-deer, by
Professor Allamand.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Buffon is of opinion, that the European
elk is likewise found in North America under
the appellation of <HI>Orignal.</HI> If any difference
exists, it consists in magnitude only, which va∣ries
<PB N="351" REF="394"/>
in proportion to climate and food. It is
not even ascertained which of them are largest.
M. de Buffon thinks that those of Europe are
larger than those of America, because all the
animals of the New Continent are smaller than
those of the Old. Most voyagers, however, re∣present
the orignal as exceeding the elk in mag∣nitude.
Mr Dudley, who sent an accurate de∣scription
of an original to the Royal Society,
says, that the hunters killed one which was more
than ten feet high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Trans. ann. 1721. No. 368. p. 165.</NOTE>. This stature would be
necessary to enable the animal to carry its enor∣mous
horns, which weigh one hundred and fifty,
and, if we believe La Hontan, three or four
hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The Duke of Richmond, who delights in col∣lecting,
for public utility, every thing that can
contribute to improve the arts, or augment our
knowledge of Nature, has a female original in
one of his parks, which was conveyed to him
by General Carleton, Governour of Canada, in
the year 1766. It was then only one year old,
and it lived nine or ten months. Some time be∣fore
it died, he caused an exact drawing of it to
be made, which he obligingly sent to me, and of
which I have given an engraving as a supple∣ment
to M. de Buffon's work. As this female
was very young, it exceeded not five feet in
height. The colour of the upper part of the
body was a deep brown, and that of the under
part was brighter.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="395"/>
I received from Canada the head of a female
orignal which was more advanced in years. Its
length, from the end of the muzzle to the ears,
is two feet three inches. Its circumference at
the ears is two feet eight inches, and, near the
mouth, one foot ten inches. The ears are nine
inches long. But, as this head is dried, these
dimensons must be smaller than when the ani∣mal
was alive.</P>
<P>M. de Buffon is likewise of opinion, that the
caribou of America is the rain-deer of Lapland;
and the reasons with which he supports this idea
have much weight. I have given a figure of
the rain-deer, which is wanting in the Paris edi∣tion.
It is a copy of that which was published
by Ridinger, a famous painter and engraver,
who drew it from the life. I have likewise been
obliged to the Duke of Richmond for a drawing
of the American caribou. This animal was
sent to him from Canada, and it lived a long
time in his park. His horns were only begin∣ning
to shoot when the figure was drawn; and
it is the only true representation we have of the
animal. By comparing it with the rain-deer,
there appears, at first sight, to be a very consi∣derable
difference between the two figures; but
the want of horns in the caribou greatly changes
its aspect.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="353" REF="396"/>
<HEAD>Addition by the Count de Buffon.</HEAD>
<P>I here give an engraving of a female rain-deer,
drawn from a living female in the posses∣sion
of the Prince of Condé. It was sent to
him by the King of Sweden, along with two
males, one of which died on the road, and the
other lived only a short time after its arrival in
France. The female resisted the effects of the
climate for a considerable time. She was of the
size of a hind; but her legs were shorter and
her body thicker. Her horns, like those of the
the male, were divided into antlers, some of
which pointed forward, and others backward.
But they were shorter than those of the males.
The following descriptiqn of this animal was
communicated to me by M. de Sève.</P>
<P>“The length of the whole body, from the
muzzle to the anus, in a superficial line, is five
feet one inch. The height of the withers is
two feet eleven inches, and that of the crup∣per
two feet eleven inches nine lines. The
hair is thick and close, like that of the stag,
the shortest on the body being an inch and
three lines in length. It is longer on the belly,
very short on the limbs, and very long about
the fetlock. The colour of the hair which
covers the body is a reddish brown, more or
<PB N="354" REF="397"/>
less deep in different parts, and sprinkled with
a kind of yellowish white. Upon part of the
back, the thighs, the top of the head, and
chanfrin, the hair is deeper coloured, espec∣ially
above the eye-pits, which the rain-deer
has as well as the stag. The circumference
of the eye is black. The muzzle is a deep
brown, and the circumference of the nostrils
is black. The point of the muzzle, as far as
the nostrils, as well as the end of the under
jaw, are of a bright white colour. The ear is
covered above with thick white hair, approach∣ing
to yellow, and mixed with brown. The
inside of the ear is adorned with large white
hairs. The neck and upper part of the body,
as well as the large hairs which hang on the
breast below the neck, are of a yellowish
white colour. Upon the sides, above the
belly, there is a large band, as in the gazelle.
The limbs are slender in proportion to the
body; and they, as well as the thighs, are of
a deep brown, and of a dirty white colour on
the inside. The ends of the hairs which co∣ver
the hoofs are likewise of a dirty white.
The feet are cloven, like those of the stag.
The two fore toes are broad and thin: The
small ones behind are long, pretty thin, and
flat on the inside. They are all extremely
black.”</P>
<P>By the figure I have given, no judgment must
be formed of the length and thickness of the
<PB N="355" REF="398"/>
rain-deer's horns, some of which extend back∣ward
from the head as far as the crupper, and
project forward in antlers of more than a foot
long. The large fossil horns found in differ∣ent
places, and particularly in Ireland, appear to
have belonged to the rain-deer species. Mr
Colinson informed me that he had seen some of
these fossil horns with an interval of ten feet be∣tween
their extremities, and with brow-antlers,
like those of the rain-deer.</P>
<P>It is to this species, therefore, and not to that
of the elk, that the fossil bones of the animal
called <HI>mouse-deer</HI> by the British are to be refer∣red.
We must acknowledge, however, that no
rain-deer now exist of such magnitude and
strength as to carry horns so long and massy as
those found in a fossil state in Ireland, as well
as in several other parts of Europe, and even in
North America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In North America, we find horns which must have be∣longed to an animal of a prodigious magnitude. Similar horns are found in Ireland. They are branched, &amp;c.; <HI>Voyage de P. Kalm, tom. 2. p.</HI> 435.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Besides, I knew only one species of rain-deer,
to which I referred the caribou of America, and
the Greenland fallow-deer, described and engra∣ven
by Mr Edwards: And, it is not long since I
was informed, that there were too species, or
rather two varieties, the one much larger than
the other. The rain-deer, of which I have gi∣ven
a figure, is the small kind, and probably the
<PB N="356" REF="399"/>
same with the Greenland fallow-deer of Mr
Edwards.</P>
<P>Some travellers tell us, that the rain-deer is
the fallow-deer of the North; that, in Green∣land,
it is wild; and that the largest of them
exceed not the size of a two-year old heifer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Pontoppidan assures us, that the rain-deer pe∣rish
in every part of the world; except the nor∣thern
regions, where they are even obliged to
inhabit the mountains. He is less to be credit∣ed
when he tells us, that their horns are move∣able;
that the animal can turn them either for∣ward
or backward; and that, above the eye-lids,
there is a small aperture in the skin, through
which he sees, when the snow prevents him from
opening his eyes. This last fact appears to be
imaginary, and borrowed from a practice of the
Laplanders, who cover their eyes with a piece
of split wood, to avoid the great splendour of the
snow, which renders them blind in a few years,
if this precaution is neglected<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppidan's Nat. Hist. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that these animals, in all their
movements, make a crackling noise: Inde∣pendent
of running, even when surprised or
touched, this noise is heard. I have been as∣sured
that the same thing happens to the elk;
but I cannot ascertain the truth of this assertion.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the Rain-deer, by Professor Cam∣per
of Groningen.</HEAD>
<P>The rain-deer sent to me from Lapland by the
way of Drontheim and Amsterdam, arrived at
Groningen the 21st day of June 1771. It was
very feeble, not only on account of the heat of
the climate and the fatigue of the voyage, but
chiefly from an ulcer between the second sto∣mach
and the diaphragm, of which it died the
next day. While it lived, it eat, with appetite,
grass, bread, and other things presented to it,
and likewise drank pretty copiously. It did not
die for want of nourishment; for, upon dissec∣tion,
I found all its stomachs full. Its death was
slow, and accompanied with convulsions.</P>
<P>It was a male of four years old. In all the
bones of the skeleton, there were epiphyses, which
proves that it had not yet acquired its full growth,
which happens not till five years of age. Hence
this animal may live at least twenty years.</P>
<P>The colour of the body was brown, mixed
with black, yellow, and white. The hairs on
the belly, and particularly on the flanks, were
white, and brown at the points, as in other deer.
The hair on the limbs was a deep yellow; and
that on the head inclined to black. The hair
on the flanks, as well as on the neck and breast,
was long and bushy.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="401"/>
The hair which covered the body was so
brittle, that, when slightly pulled, it broke trans∣versely.
It lay in an undulated form, and its
substance resembled the pith of rushes. The
brittle part of it was white. The hair on the
head and the under part of the legs, as far as the
hoofs, had not this fragility, but, on the con∣trary,
was as strong as that of a cow.</P>
<P>The coronet of the hoofs was covered on all
sides with very long hair. Between the toes of
the hind feet there was a broad pellicle, com∣posed
of the skin which covers the body, but
interspersed with small glands.</P>
<P>In the hind feet, at the height of the coronets,
a kind of canal, sufficient to admit a goose quill,
and filled with very long hairs, penetrated as far
as the articulation of the canon with the small
bones of the toes. I discovered no such canal in
the fore feet; neither do I know the use of it.</P>
<P>The figure of this animal differed much from
that described by other authors, because it was
extremely emaciated. The length of the body,
from the muzzle to the anus, was five feet, and
its height before three feet.</P>
<P>The eyes differ not from those of the fallow-deer
or stag. The pupil is transverse; and the
iris is brown, inclining to black. The eye-pits
resemble those of the stag, and are filled with a
whitish, resinous, and somewhat transparent
matter. As in the fallow-deer, there are two
lachrymal ducts and canals. The upper eye-lid
<PB N="359" REF="402"/>
has very long, black <HI>cilia.</HI> It is not perfo∣rated,
as some authors have fancied, but entire.
The Bishop of Pontoppidan, and, upon his au∣thority,
M. Haller, have attempted to account
for this supposed perforation: They thought it
necessary, in a country perpetually covered with
snow, to defend the animal's eyes against the
excessive glare of reflected light. Man, who is
destined to live in all climates, prevents blind∣ness
as much as possible by veils, or small per∣forated
machines, which weaken the splendour
of the light. The rain-deer, who is made for
this climate alone, has no occasion for such me∣chanism.
But he is furnished with a nictitating
membrane, or an internal eye-lid, like the birds,
and some other quadrupeds. Neither is this
membrane perforated: It is capable of covering
the whole cornea.</P>
<P>The nose of the rain-deer is very large, like
that of the cow; and the muzzle is more or less
flat, and covered with long grayish hair, which
extends to the internal part of the nostril. The
lips are likewise covered with hair, except a
small border, which is blackish, hard, and very
porous. The nostrils are very distant from each
other. The under lip is narrow, and the mouth
deep cut, as in the sheep.</P>
<P>He has eight cutting teeth in the under jaw;
but they are very small, and loosely fixed. Like
the other ruminating animals, he has no cutting
teeth in the upper jaw. But I thought I per∣ceived
<PB N="360" REF="403"/>
tusks, though they had not yet pierced
the gums; and I observed no such appearance
in the under jaw. Horses have tusks in both
jaws; but mares seldom have any. The fallow-deer,
both males and females, seldom or never
have tusks. But I lately procured the head of
a hind recently brought forth, which had a large
tusk in the left side of the upper jaw: Nature
is so various in this article, that no constant rule
can be established. There are six grinders in
each side of both jaws, or twenty-four in all.</P>
<P>I have nothing to remark concerning the
horns; for they were only beginning to shoot:
One of them was an inch and the other an
inch and a half high. Their base was situated
nearer the occiput than the orbit of the eye.
The hair which covered them was beautifully
turned, and of a gray colour, inclining to black.
In viewing the two shoots at a distance, they
had the appearance of two large mice sitting on
the animal's head.</P>
<P>The neck is short, and more arched than that
of the sheep, but less than that of the camel.
The body seemed to be naturally robust. The
back is a little elevated toward the shoulders, and
pretty straight every where else, though the ver∣tebrae
are somewhat arched.</P>
<P>The tail is very small, bent downward, and
garnished with long bushy hair.</P>
<P>The testicles are very small, and appear not
without the body. The penis is not large.
<PB N="361" REF="404"/>
The prepuce is naked, like a navel, full of
wrinkles in the inside, and covered with a cal∣careous
crust.</P>
<P>The hoofs are large, long, and convex on the
outside. The spurs are also very long, and some
of them touch the ground when the animal
stands. They were hollow, probably because he
makes no use of them.</P>
<P>The intestines were exactly similar to those
of the fallow-deer. There was no gall-bladder.
The kidneys were smooth, and undivided. The
lungs and wind-pipe were very large.</P>
<P>The heart was of a middle size, and, like that
of the fallow-deer, contained only one small
bone. This bone supported the base of the se∣milunar
valve of the aorta, which is opposed to
two others, from which the coronary arteries
of the heart derive their origin. It likewise
gives firmness to the membranous partition be∣tween
the two cavities of the heart, and to the
triglochine valve of the right ventricle.</P>
<P>In this animal there is a singular pouch, very
large, membranous, and situated under the skin
of the neck. It begins by a conical canal be∣tween
the os hyoides and the thyroide cartilage.
This canal gradually enlarges, and is changed
into a kind of membranous sac, supported by
two oblong muscles, which derive their origin
from the inferior part of the os hyoides, precise∣ly
where the base, the pisiform bone, and the
cornua unite.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="405"/>
This pouch opens into the larynx, under the
root of the epiglottis, by a large orifice, which
easily admitted my finger.</P>
<P>When the animal pushed the air forcibly out
of the lungs, as in lowing, the air passed into this
pouch, swelled it, and necessarily produced a
considerable tumour, which greatly changed the
sound. The two muscles drive the air out of
the pouch, when the animal ceases its lowing.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago, I showed a similar
pouch in several baboons and monkeys; and,
the year following, I demonstrated to my pupils,
that there was a double pouch in the Ourang-outang.</P>

<P>THE Greeks, it is probable, were acquaint∣ed
with the wild and chamois goats. But
they have neither pointed out these animals by
particular denominations, nor by characters so
<PB N="364" REF="409"/>
precise, as to enable us to distinguish them.
They have denominated them, in general, <HI>wild
goats</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rupicapras inter capras sylvestres adnumerare libet, quo∣niam hoc nomen apud solum Plinium legimus, et apud Grae∣cos simpliciter <HI>ferae ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rae</HI> dicuntur, ut conjicio: Nam et mag∣nitudine et figura tum cornuum tum figura corporis ad villa∣ticas proxime accedunt; <HI>Gesner. hist. quad. p.</HI> 292.</NOTE>. They perhaps regarded these animals
as of the same species with the domestic kind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Caprae quas alimus, a capris feris sunt ortae a queis propter Italiam, Capraria insula est nominata, <HI>Varro.</HI></NOTE>, having never bestowed on them proper names,
as they have done to every other species of qua∣druped.
Our modern naturalists, on the contra∣ry,
have considered the wild and the chamois
goats as two distinct species, and both different
from the common goat. There are facts and
arguments in favour of both opinions, of which
we shall only give a detail, till we learn from
experience whether these animals can intermix
together, and produce fertile individuals; as this
circumstance alone can determine the question.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="410"/>
The male wild goat differs from the chamois
in the length, thickness, and figure of his horns.
His body is also larger, and he is more vigorous
and strong. The horns of the female wild goat
are smaller than those of the male, and have a
great resemblance to those of the chamois<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foemina in hoc genere mare suo minor est, minusque fusca, major Capra villatica, Rupicaprae non adeo dissimilis: Cornua ei parva, et ea quoque Rupicaprae aut vulgaris caprae cornibus fere similia; <HI>Stumpfius apud Gesner, p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>.
Besides, the manners and dispositions of these
two animals are the same, and they inhabit the
same climate; only the wild goat, being strong∣er
and more agile, goes to the summits of the
highest mountains, while the chamois never rises
higher than the second stage<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rupes montium colunt Rupicaprae, non summas tamen ut Ibex, neque tam alte et longe saliunt; descendunt aliquan∣do ad inferiora Alpium juga; <HI>Gesner, Hist. quad. p.</HI> 292.</NOTE>. But neither of
them are found in the plains. Both of them
clear roads in the snow, and leap from one pre∣cipice
to another. Both are covered with a
firm, solid skin, and clothed, in winter, with a
double fur, the external hair being coarse, and the
internal finer and more bushy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The chamois goat has longer legs than the domestic kind; but his hair is shorter. That which covers the belly and thighs is the longest, and exceeds not four inches and a half. On the back and flanks the hair is of two kinds; for, as in the beaver, beside the long external hair, there is a very short, fine hair, concealed round the roots of the longer kind. The head, the belly, and the legs, were covered with coarse hair only; <HI>Mem. pour servir a I'hist. des Animaux, part. 1. p.</HI> 203.</NOTE>. Both of them
have a black band on the back, and tails of near∣ly
<PB N="366" REF="411"/>
an equal size. The number of external resem∣blances
is so great, and the conformity of the inter∣nal
parts is so complete, that we would be induced
to conclude, that these two animals are not only
simple, but permanent varieties of the same spe∣cies.
Besides, the wild, as well as the chamois
goats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of the island of Crete might take the young of the bouc-estain (of which there are great quantities) wandering in the mountains, and feed and tame them along with the domestic kind.... They are covered with yellow hair. When old, they become gray, and a black liue runs along the spine of the back. We have some of them in the mountains of France, and chiefly in places full of precipices, and of difficult access.... The bouc-estain leaps from one rock to another, at the distance of six fathoms, an exertion almost incredible to those who have not seen it; <HI>Observ. de Belon, p.</HI> 14.—Audio Rupicapras aliquando cicurari; <HI>Gesner, de quad. p.</HI> 292.—Vaslesii ibicem in prima aetate captam om∣nino cicurari, et cum villaticis capris ad pascua ire et redire, aiunt; progressu tamen aetatis ferum ingenium non prorsus exuere; <HI>Stampfius apud Gesner, Hist. quad. p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>, when taken young, and reared along
with the domestic kind, are easily tamed, assume
the same manners, go in flocks, return to the
same fold, and probably couple and produce to∣gether.
I acknowledge, however, that this last
fact, which is the most important of all, and
would alone decide the question, is by no means
established. We have never been able, with
certainty, to learn whether the wild and cha∣mois
goats produce with the common kind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the compilation of natural history made by Mess. Arnault de Nobleville and Salerne, it is said, (tom. 4. p. 264.) that the chamois goats are in season during almost the whole month of September; that the females go with young nine months; and that they generally bring forth in June. If these facts were true, they would demonstrate that the cha∣mois is not the same species with the goat, which goes with young about six months only: But I think they are suspi∣cious, if not false. The hunters, as appears from the passages already quoted, assure us, on the contrary, that the chamois and wild goats do not come in season till the month of No∣vember; and that the females bring forth in May. Thus the time of gestation, instead of being extended to nine months, should be reduced to near five, as in the domestic goat. But this matter must be decided by experience alone.</NOTE>. We
only suspect this to be the case. In this respect,
we agree with the antients; and, besides, our
<PB N="367" REF="412"/>
conjecture seems to be founded on strong ana∣logies,
which are seldom contradicted by expe∣rience.</P>
<P>Let us, however, consider the opposite argu∣ments.
The wild and chamois goats both sub∣sist
in the state of nature, and yet they always
remain distinct. The chamois sometimes mingles
spontaneously with the flocks of the domestic
kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rupicaprae aliquando accedunt usque ad greges capra∣rum cicurum quos non refugiunt, quod non saciunt ibices; <HI>Gesner, Hist. quad. p.</HI> 292.</NOTE>; but the wild goat never associates with
them, unless when tamed. The male wild goat
and the common he-goat have very long beards,
and the chamois has none. The horns of the
male and female chamois are small: Those of
the wild he-goat are so large and so long<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibex egregium ut et corpulentum animal, specie fere cervina minus tamen, cruribus quidem gracilibus et capite parvo cervum exprimit.

<PB N="368" REF="413"/>
we could hardly imagine they belonged to an
animal of his size. The chamois seems to differ
from the wild goat, and the common he-goat,
by the direction of his horns, which incline a
little forward in their inferior part, and bend
backward at the point like a hook. But, as we
remarked in the history of the ox and sheep,
the horns of domestic animals, as well as those
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wild animals living in different climates, vary
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>digiously. The horns of our female goat
are not entirely similar to those of the male.
The horns of the male wild goat are not very different
from those of our he-goat: And, as the
female wild goat approaches the domestic kind,
and even the chamois, in size, and in the small∣ness
of its horns, may we not conclude, that the
males of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wild, chamois, and domestic goats,
are only one species of animal, in which the
nature of the females is constant and similar a∣mong
themselves, but that the males are subject
to considerable variations? In this point of view,
which is not, perhaps, removed so far from na∣ture
as may be imagined, the wild goat would
be the original male stock, and the chamois
would be the female<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The want of a beard in the chamois is a female charac∣ter, which ought to be added to the others. The male cha∣mois appears, as well as the female, to participate of the fe∣minine qualities of the she-goat. Thus it may be presumed, that the domestic he-goat would engender with the female chamois; and that, on the contrary, the male chamois could not engender with the female domestic goat. Time will verify or destroy this conjecture.</NOTE>. I say, that this point
<PB N="369" REF="414"/>
of view is not imaginary, since we can prove
from experience, that there are animals in na∣ture,
in which the female can equally serve
males of different species, and produce from
them both. The sheep produces with the he-goat
as well as with the ram, and always brings forth
lambs which are individuals of its own species.
The ram, on the contrary, produces not with the
she-goat. The sheep, therefore, may be regard∣ed
as a female common to two different males;
and, consequently, she constitutes a species inde∣pendent
of the male. The same thing will hap∣pen
to the wild goat. The female alone repre∣sents
the primitive species, because her nature is
constant. The males, on the contrary, vary;
and it is extremely probable, that the domestic
she-goat, which may be considered as the same
female as those of the wild and chamois kinds,
would produce equally with these three different
males, which alone admit of varieties in species;
and, consequently, though they seem to change
the unity, alter not the identity of the species.</P>
<P>These, as well as all other possible relations,
must necessarily exist in nature. It even ap∣pears,
that the females contribute more to the
support of the species than the males; for,
though both concur in the first formation of the
<PB N="370" REF="415"/>
foetus, the female, who afterwards furnishes
every thing necessary to its growth and nutri∣tion,
modifies and assimilates it more to her own
nature, and must, therefore, greatly efface the
impression of the parts derived from the male.
Thus, if we want to form a distinct judgment
of a species, we ought to examine the females.
The male bestows one half of the animated sub∣stance:
The female gives an equal portion, and
furnishes, besides, all the matter necessary for
the developement of the form. A beautiful wo∣man
seldom fails to produce beautiful children.
The offspring of a beautiful man with an ugly
woman, are generally still more ugly.</P>
<P>Hence, even in the same species, there may
sometimes be two races, the one masculine and
the other feminine, which, by both subsisting
and perpetuating their distinctive characters, ap∣pear
to constitute two different species; and this
seems to be the case, when it is almost impossible
to fix the limits between what naturalists term
<HI>species</HI> and <HI>variety.</HI> Let us suppose, for ex∣ample,
that some sheep were always served with
he-goats, and others with rams; after a certain
number of generations, a race would be esta∣blished
among the species of sheep, which would
partake greatly of the nature of the goat, and
would afterwards perpetuate its own kind; for,
though the first produce of the he-goat would
be little removed from the mother's species, and
would be a lamb, and not a kid; yet this lamb
<PB N="371" REF="416"/>
is already covered with hair, and possesses some
other characters of the father. Let these fe∣male
mongrels be afterwards served with a he-goat;
the produce in this second generation will
make a nearer approach to the species of the
father, and still nearer in the third, &amp;c. In this
manner, the foreign characters would soon over-balance
the natural ones; and this fictitious race
might support itself, and form a variety in the
species, the origin of which would be difficult to
trace. Now, what might arise from the influ∣ence
of one species on another, may be produced
with greater ease in the same species. If vigo∣rous
females be constantly served with feeble
males, in process of time, a feminine race will
be establislied; and, if very strong males are ap∣propriated
to females of inferior strength and
vigour, a masculine race will be the result, so
different in appearance from the first, that we
could not assign to them a common origin, and,
of course, would regard them as two distinct
species.</P>
<P>To these general reflections, we shall add some
particular facts. We are assured by Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Capra cornibus depressis, incurvis, minimis, cranio in∣cumbentibus, gula barbata. Magnitudo haedi hirci: Pili longi, penduli; cornua lunata, crassa, vix digitum longa, cranio adpressa ut fere cutem perforent: Habitat in America. Lin∣naeus, I suspect, has not been properly informed with regard to the country of this animal, and I believe it to be a native of Africa. My reasons are, 1. That no author mentions this species of goat, nor even the common goat, as being ever found in America; 2. That all travellers, on the contrary, agree in assuring us, that there are three kinds of goats in Africa, a large, a middle, and a small kind; 3. That we have seen an animal, which we received under the name of the <HI>African Buck,</HI> and of which we have given a figure, that re∣sembled so much Linnaeus's description of the <HI>capra cornibus depreossis,</HI> &amp;c. that we considered it to be the very same ani∣mal. For these reasons, we are entitled to affirm, that this small goat is an original native of Africa, and not of America.</P>

that he saw in Holland two animals of the goat-kind,
of which the one had very short, thick
horns, lying almost flat on the skull; the horns
of the other were erect, and bended backward
at the points, and its hair was short. These
animals, though they seemed to be more remote
in species than the chamois and common goat,
failed not to produce together; which demon∣strates
that these differences in the figure of the
horns and length of the hair, are not essential
and specific characters; for, as the animals pro∣duced
together, they must be regarded as belong∣ing
to the same species. From this example, it
may be concluded, that the chamois and our
goat, whose principal differences lie in the form
of the horns and the length of the hair, are pro∣bably
the same species.</P>
<P>In the royal cabinet, there is the skeleton of
an animal, which was sent under the name of
<PB N="373" REF="418"/>
<HI>capricorne.</HI> In the form of the body and pro∣portions
of the bones, it has a perfect resem∣blance
to the domestic he-goat; and the figure
of the under jaw is the same with that of the
wild goat. But it differs from both in the horns:
Those of the wild goat have prominent tubercles
or knobs, and two longitudinal ridges, between
which there is a well marked anterior face:
Those of the common he-goat have but one
ridge, and no tubercles. The horns of the ca∣pricorne
have but one ridge, and no anterior
face: Though they want tubercles, they have
rugosities which are larger than those of the he-goat.
These differences seem to indicate an in∣termediate
race between the wild and the do∣mestic
goat. Besides, the horns of the capri∣corne
are short, and crooked at the point, like
those of the chamois; and, at the same time,
they are compressed and ringed: Hence they
partake at once of the he-goat, the wild goat,
and the chamois goat.</P>

These animals have been doubtless bred in Jamaica ever since the time of the Spaniards, and thrive very well in every quarter of the island; but they are generally very small. A sheep carried from a cold climate to any of those sultry re∣gions, soon alters its appearance; for, in an year or two, in∣stead of wool, it puts out a coat of hair like a goat. <HI>The civil and natural history of Jamaica, by Patrick Brown, M. D. chap. 5. sect.</HI> 4.</P></NOTE>, in his history of Jamaica, in∣forms
us, that there are in that island, 1. The
<PB N="374" REF="419"/>
common domestic goat of Europe; 2. the cha∣mois;
3. the wild goat. He assures us, that
none of these animals are natives of America,
but have been transported from Europe; that,
like the sheep, they have degenerated and be∣come
smaller in this new country; that
the wool of the sheep is changed into hair as coarse
as that of the goat; that the wild goat seems to
be a bastard race, &amp;c. Hence we are led to
believe, that the small goat with erect horns,
and crooked at the points, which Linnaeus saw
in Holland, and was said to have come from A∣merica,
is the chamois of Jamaica, that is, the
European chamois degenerated and diminished
by the climate of America; and that the wild
goat of Jamaica, called the <HI>bastard wild goat</HI>
<PB N="375" REF="420"/>
by Mr Brown, is our capricorne, which seems
to be nothing else than the wild goat degenera∣ted
by the influence of climate.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton, after scrupulously examining
the relations of the chamois to the he-goat and
ram, says, in general, that it has a greater resem∣blance
to the he-goat than to the ram. Next to
the horns, the chief differences are found in the
figure and size of the front, which is less eleva∣ted
and shorter, and the form of the nose, which
is more contracted in the chamois than in the
he-goat; so that, in these two articles, the cha∣mois
resembles the ram more than the he-goat.
But, by supposing, what is extremely probable,
that the chamois is a constant variety of the
species of the he-goat, as the bull-dog and grey∣hound
are constant varieties in the dog-kind, we
will perceive that these differences in the size
of the front and the position of the nose, are not
nearly so great in the chamois, when compared
with the he-goat, as in the bull-dog and grey∣hound,
which, however, produce together, and
certainly belong to the same species. Besides,
as the chamois resembles the he-goat in a great∣er
number of characters than the ram, if he con∣stituted
a particular species, it must necessarily be
an intermediate one between the he-goat and
the ram. Now, we have seen, that the he-goat
and ewe produce together: The chamois, there∣fore,
which is an intermediate species between
the two, and, at the same time, has a greater
<PB N="376" REF="421"/>
number of resemblances to the he-goat than to
the ram, ought to produce with the she-goat, and,
consequently, should be regarded as only a con∣stant
variety of this species.</P>
<P>Hence, as the chamois was transported in∣to
America, where it has become smaller, and
produces with the small she-goat of Africa, it is
more than probable that he would also pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
with our she-goats. The chamois, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
only a constant variety in the goat-gind,
like the bull-dog in the species of dog.
On the other hand, the wild goat is unquestion∣ably
the primitive goat in a state of nature, and
is, with regard to the domestic goats, what the
mouflon is to the sheep. The wild he-goat
perfectly resembles the domestic he-goat in fi∣gure,
structure, habits, and dispositions; and
there are only two slight external differences be∣tween
them. The horns of the wild he-goat
are larger than those of the common he-goat.
The former have two longitudinal ridges, and
the latter but one. They have also large trans∣verse
protuberant rings, which mark the years of
their growth; whilst those of the domestic he-goat
have only a kind of transverse striae or
furrows. The figure of their bodies is precise∣ly
the same. Their internal structure is likewise
perfectly similar, with the exception of the
spleen, which is oval in the wild he-goat, and
approaches nearer to the spleen of the roebuck
or stag, than to that of the he-goat or ram.
<PB N="377" REF="422"/>
This difference may proceed from the violent
exercise of the animal. The wild he-goat runs
as swiftly as the stag, and leaps more nimbly
than the roebuck. His spleen, therefore, should
resemble that of the swiftest running animals.
Hence this slight difference depends more upon
habit than nature; and it is probable, that, if
our domestic he-goat should become wild, and
were obliged to run and leap like the wild he-goat,
his spleen would soon assume the figure
most conformable to this exercise. With re∣gard
to the difference of his horns, though very
conspicuous, they fail not to resemble those of the
domestic he-goat more than those of any other
animal. Thus the wild and common he-goat
approach nearer each other, even in the form
of their horns, than any other animal; and, as
their resemblance is complete in every other
article, we should conclude, that, notwithstand∣ing
this slight and solitary difference, they are
both animals of the same species.</P>
<P>The wild, the chamois, and the domestic goat
must, therefore, be considered as the same spe∣cies,
the males of which have undergone great∣er
variations than the females: I find, at the
same time, in the domestic kind, secondary va∣rieties,
which are the less equivocal, because they
belong equally to the males and females. We
have seen that the goat of Angora<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. III. p. 493.</NOTE>, though very
<PB N="378" REF="423"/>
different from ours in the hairs and horns, is ne∣vertheless
of the same species. The same thing
may be said of the Juda goat, which Linnaeus has
properly considered as a variety of the domestic
species. This goat, which is common in Gui∣ney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Guiney there are great numbers of goats similar to those in Europe, except that, like all the other cattle, they are very small. But they are fatter and plumper than wed∣ders: It is for this reason that some people prefer the flesh of these small he-goats, which the natives castrate, to mut∣ton; <HI>Voyage de Bosman, p.</HI> 238.</NOTE>,
Angola, and other parts of Africa, may
be said to differ from ours only in being smaller,
fatter, and more squat. Its flesh is excellent;
and, in that country, it is preferred to mutton,
as we prefer mutton to goat's flesh. The Le∣vant
or Mambrina goat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is called the Mambrina goat, because it is found on Mount Mambrina in Syria.—Capra Indica; <HI>Gesner, hist. quad. p.</HI> 267.—Hircus cornibus minimis, erectis, pa∣rumper retrorsum incurvis, auriculis longissimis pendulis.—Capra Syriaca; <HI>La chevre de Syrie; Brisson. regn. anim. p.</HI> 72.</NOTE>, with long pendulous

<P>With regard to the small goat which Linnaeus
saw alive, and which produced with the Ameri∣can
chamois, it must, as formerly remarked,
have been originally transported from Africa;
for it so strongly resembles the he-goat of Africa,
that it is unquestionably the same species; or, at
least, it has sprung from the same stock. In A∣frica
it is small; and it would become still less
in America; and we learn, from the testimony
of travellers, that sheep, hogs, and goats, have
frequently, and for several ages back, been trans∣ported
from Africa, as well as Europe, into A∣merica,
where they still subsist, without any o∣ther
change than a diminution of size.</P>
<P>After examining the different varieties of goats,
of which the nomenclators have made nine or
ten different species, I am convinced that they
<PB N="380" REF="425"/>
ought to be reduced to one: 1. The wild he-goat
is the principal stock of the species. 2.
The capricorn is the wild he-goat degenerated
by the influence of climate. 3. The domestic
he-goat derives his origin from the wild he-goat.
4. The chamois is only a variety in the
species of the she-goat, with whom, like the wild
he-goat, he should be able to mix and produce.
5. The small goat, with erect horns, crooked at
the points, mentioned by Linnaeus, is the European
chamois diminished by the influence of the
American climate. 6. The other small goat, with
horns lying flat on the skull, and which produ∣ced
with the American chamois, is the same with
the African he-goat; the fertility of these two
animals is a proof that our chamois and domes∣tic
goat would also produce together, and, of
course, that they belong to the same species. 7.
The dwarf goat, which is probably the female
of the African buck, is only, as well as the male,
a variety of the common kind. 8. The same
thing may be said of the buck and she-goat of
Juda; for they are only varieties of our domestic
goat. 9. The goat of Angora, as it produces
with our goats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. III. Article Goat.</NOTE>, belongs to the same species.
10. The Mambrina or Syrian goat, with very
long pendulous ears, is a variety of the goat of
Angora. Thus these ten animals are only different
races of the same species, which have
<PB N="381" REF="426"/>
been produced by the influence of climate. <HI>Ca∣prae
in multas similitudines transfigurantur,</HI> says
Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caprae tamen in plurimas similitudines transfigurantur; sunt capreae, sunt rupicaprae, sunt ibices.—Sunt et origes.—Sunt et Damae et Pygargi et Strepsicerotes, multaque alia haud dissimilia; <HI>lib. 8. cap.</HI> 53.</NOTE>. Indeed, from this enumeration, it is
apparent, that the goats, though essentially si∣milar
among themselves, vary greatly in their
external form; and, if we comprehend, like
Pliny, under the generic name of <HI>Goats,</HI> not
only those we have mentioned, but likewise the
roebuck, the antilopes, &amp;c. this species would
be the most extensive in Nature, and contain
more races and varieties than that of the dog.
But Pliny, when he joined the roebuck, anti∣lopes,
&amp;c. to the species of the goat, betrayed
his ignorance of the real distinction of species.
These animals, though they resemble the goat
in many respects, constitute two different spe∣cies;
and we will perceive from the following
articles, how greatly the antilopes vary both in
species and in races; and, after enumerating all
the antilopes and all the goats, we will still
find other animals which participate of both.
In the whole history of quadrupeds, I have met
with nothing so confused, so uncertain, and so
obscure, as the accounts given us by naturalists
and travellers concerning the goats, the anti∣lopes,
and the species which have a relation to
them. I have exerted every effort to throw
<PB N="382" REF="427"/>
light upon this subject; and shall not regret my
labour, if what I now write should contribute
to remove error, and to extend the views of
those who incline to study Nature. But to re∣turn
to our subject.</P>
<P>The goats are subject to vertigos: This disease
is likewise common to the wild and chamois
goats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the mountains of Switzerland, the chamois or wild goats are very frequent.—The natives inform us, that these animals are subject to vertigos; and that, when attacked with this disease, they sometimes come down to the meadows, and mix with the horses and cows, when they are taken with ease; <HI>Extrait du voyage de Jean-Jacques Scheuchzer; Nouvelles de la Re∣publique des Lettres, p.</HI> 182.</NOTE>, as well as the inclination to climb up∣on
rocks, and the habit of perpetually licking
stones<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Conveniunt saepe circa petras quasdam arenosas, et are∣nam inde lingunt.—Qui Alpes incolunt Helvetii hos lo∣cos sua lingua <HI>Fultzen</HI> tanquam salarios appellant; <HI>Gesner, hist. quad. p.</HI> 292.—What is singular, in the Alps there are seve∣ral rocks which have been hollowed by the constant licking of the chamois goats. This licking is not occasioned, as has been alledged, by salt contained in these stones, which is very rarely the case; for the rocks are porous, and composed of grains of sand, which are easily detached; and they are swallowed by the animals with great avidity; <HI>Extrait de Scheuchzer, ibid. p.</HI> 185.</NOTE>, especially those which are impregnated
with nitre or salt. In the Alps, we find rocks
hollowed with the tongues of the chamois.
They are generally composed of tender and cal∣cinable
stones, in which there is always a cer∣tain
quantity of nitre. These conformities in
natural dispositions and manners appear to be
<PB N="383" REF="428"/>
infallible indications of identity of species. The
Greeks, as formerly remarked, did not divide
these three animals into three distinct kinds;
and our hunters, who probably never consulted
the Greeks, have also regarded them as the same
species. Gaston Phaebus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La venerie de Gaston Phaebus, p. 68.</NOTE>, when treating of
the wild goat, points him out under the name
of the <HI>wild buck;</HI> and the chamois, which he
calls <HI>ysarus and sarris,</HI> in his estimation, is only
another wild buck. I acknowledge that all these
authorities amount not to a complete proof: But,
when joined to the facts and reasonings already
employed, they form so strong a presumption, with
regard to the unity of species in these three ani∣mals,
as leaves no room for hesitation.</P>
<P>The wild and chamois goats, which I consi∣dered,
the one as the male, and the other as the
female stock of the goat-kind, are only found,
like the mouflon, which is the stock of the sheep,
in the deserts and in the highest and most rug∣ged
mountains. The Alps, the Pyrennees, the
Grecian mountains, and those in the islands of
the Archipelago, are almost the only places where
the wild and chamois goats are to be met with.
Though both avoid heat, and inhabit the regions
of snow and frost; yet they equally avoid the
excessive rigours of cold. In summer they dwell
on the northern sides of the mountains; in win∣ter,
they frequent the southern sides, and de∣scend
<PB N="384" REF="429"/>
from the summits into the plains. Nei∣ther
of them can support themselves on smooth
sheets of ice; but, when the ice is rendered
rough by the snow, they run and bound with
great firmness and agility. The chace of those
animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There are two kinds of bucks; some are called <HI>wild bucks,</HI> and others <HI>ysarus</HI> or <HI>sarris.</HI> The wild bucks are as large as a stag; but, though they have as much flesh, they are neither so long, nor make such large bounds. The years of their age correspond with the number of rings across their horns.—When old, their horns, which have no branches, are as thick as a man's leg. They never cast their horns; but they continue to grow in length and thickness as long as the animal lives. They have a large beard, and their hair is brown like that of the wolf. A black bar runs along their back and down the buttocks. Their belly is yellow, and their legs black, and yellow behind. Their feet, like those of the domestic goat, are cloven; and their tracks are large, and rounder than those of the stag. The female, like that of the hind, or common she-goat, produces but one at a time.</P>
<P>The bucks feed upon herbage like other cattle.—Their dung resembles that of the domestic goat. They come in season about All Saints-day, and their rutting season continues a month. When that season is over, they are much emaciated; and they descend from the rocks and mountains, where they had dwelt during the summer, to the plains, in quest of food. They remain at the foot of the mountains till toward Easter, when they return to the most elevated places they can find, and each takes possession of his bush, like the stags. The females, at this period, separate from the males, and retire near the brooks, in order to fawn, where they remain during the summer. When the bucks are thus separated from the females, especially at the approach of the rutting season, they attack both man and beast. They also fight among themselves, like the stags, but in a different manner; for their quarrels are more formidable. The buck strikes so furiously with his head, that he often breaks the legs of those whom he attacks; and, if he runs a man against a tree, or throws him down on the ground, death is infalli∣bly the consequence. Such is the nature of the buck, that, though a strong man gives him a blow on the back with a bar of iron, the animal's spine is not broken. In the season of love, his neck swells prodigiously: And, though he falls from a height of ten fathoms, he receives no injury.</P>
<P>The buck called <HI>Ysarus</HI> is of the same figure with the pre∣ceding, and is not larger than the domestic he-goat. His na∣ture is the same with that of the wild buck.—Like the stag, both come in season about All Saints-day, and they should be hunted till that period arrives.—When they can find no other food in winter, they eat the leaves of the pine-tree, which are always green. Their skin, when pro∣perly dressed, is an excellent defence against the cold; for, when the hair is outmost, neither cold nor rain can pene∣trate it. Their flesh is not very wholesome; for it produces fevers.—The hunting of the buck is not very pleasant; for we can neither accompany the dogs on foot nor on horseback; <HI>Gaston Phaebus, Venerie de Dusoilloux, p.</HI> 68.</P></NOTE>, especially that of the wild he-goat,
<PB N="385" REF="430"/>
is very laborious; for dogs are almost useless in
this kind of hunting. It is also sometimes dange∣rous:
When the animal finds himself hard push∣ed,
he gives the hunter a violent blow with his
head, and often throws him over a precipice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibex venatorem expectat, et solicite observat an inter ipsum et rupem minimum intersit spatium; nam si visu dum∣taxat intertueri (ut ita loquar) possit, impetu facto se trans∣fert et venatorem impulsum praecipitat; <HI>Stumpfius apud Gesner, p.</HI> 305.</NOTE>.
Though not so strong as the wild bucks, the
chamois goats are equally active<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. Perroud, undertaker of the crystal mines in the Alps, brought a live chamois to Versailles, and gave us the follow∣ing excellent remarks on the nature and manners of this ani∣mal. “The chamois, though a wild animal, is very docile. He inhabits only the mountains and rocks. He is of the size of a domestic goat, whom he greatly resembles. His vivacity is delightful, and his agility truly admirable. His hair is as short as that of a hind: In spring, it is ash-coloured, in summer it is yellowish, in autumn yellowish brown mixed with black, and, in winter, brownish black. The chamois goats are numerous in the mountains of Upper Dauphiny, Peidmont, Savoy, Switzerland, and Germany. They are very social among themselves: We find them go∣ing in pairs, or in little flocks of from three to twenty; and sometimes we see from sixty to a hundred of them dispersed in different flocks along the declivity of the same mountain. The large males keep at a distance from the rest, except in the rutting season, when they join the females, and beat off all the young. At this period, their ardour is still stronger than that of the wild bucks. They bleat often, and run from one mountain to another. Their season of love is in the months of October and November, and they bring forth in March and April. A young female takes the male at the age of eighteen months. The females bring forth one, but rarely two, at a time. The young follow their mothers till October, if not dispersed by the hunters or the wolves. We are assured that they live between twenty and thirty years. Their flesh is very good. A fat chamois goat will yield from ten to twelve pounds of su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, which is harder and better than that of the goat. The blood of the chamois is extremely hot, and it is said to have qualities and virtues nearly equal to those of the wild goat, and may serve the same purposes; for the effects are the same, when taken in a double dose. It is good against pleurisies, and possesses the property of purifying the blood, and promoting perspiration. The hunters sometimes mix the blood of the wild and chamois goats: At other times, they sell the blood of the wild goat for that of the chamois. It is very difficult to distin∣guish them; which shows that the blood of the wild goat differs very little from that of the chamois. The voice of the chamois is a very low and almost imperceptible kind of bleating, resembling that of a hoarse domestic goat. It is by this bleating that they collect together, particularly the mo∣thers and their young. But, when alarmed, or when they per∣ceive their enemy, or any thing the nature of which they cannot distinguish, they advertise one another by a kind of whistling noise, which I shall afterwards describe. The sight of the chamois is very penetrating, and his sense of smell∣ing is acute. When he sees a man distinctly, he stops for some time, and flies off when he makes a nearer approach. His sense of hearing is equally acute as that of smelling; for he hears the smallest noise. When the wind blows in the direction between him and a man, he will perceive the scent at the distance of more than half a league. Hence, when he smells or hears any thing which he cannot see, he whistles or blows with such force, that the rocks and forests re-eccho the sound. If there are many of them near, they all take the alarm. This whistling is as long as the animal can blow, without taking breath. It is at first sharp, and turns flat at the end. The chamois then stops for a moment, looks round on all sides, and begins whistling afresh, which he continues from time to time. His agitation is extreme. He strikes the earth with his feet. He leaps upon the highest stones he can find: He again looks round, leaps from one eminence to an∣other, and, when he discovers any thing, he flies off. The whistling of the male is sharper than that of the female. This whistling is performed through the nostrils, and consists of a strong blowing, similar to the sound which a man may make by fixing his tongue to the palate, with his teeth nearly shut, his lips open, and somewhat extended, and blowing long and with great force. The chamois feeds on the finest herbs. He selects the most delicate parts of plants, as the flowers and the tenderest buds. He is very fond of some aromatic herbs, particularly of the carline thistle and genipay, which are the hottest plants that grow in the Alps. When he eats green herbs, he drinks very little. He is very fond of the leaves and tender buds of shrubs. He ruminates like the common goat. The food he uses seems to announce the heat of his constitu∣tion. This animal is admired for his large round eyes, whose size corresponds with the vivacity of his disposition. His head is adorned with two small horns, from half a foot to nine inches in length. Their colour is a fine black, and they are placed on the front nearly between his eyes; and, in∣stead of being reflected backward, like those of other animals, they advance forward above the eyes, and bend backward at the points, which are extremely sharp. He adjusts his ears most beautifully to the points of his horns. Two tusts of black hair descend from his horns to the sides of his face. The rest of the head is of a yellowish white colour, which never changes. The horns of the chamois are used for the heads of canes. Those of the female are smaller and less crooked. The skin of the chamois, when dressed, is very strong, nervous, and supple, and makes excellent riding breeches, gloves, and vests. Garments of this kind last long, and are of great use to manufacturers. The chamois is a native of cold countries, and always prefers rugged rocks and lofty places. They frequent the woods; but it is only those in the higher regions of the mountains. These woods con∣sists of pines, larches, and beeches. The chamois goats are so impatient of heat, that, in summer, they are only to be found under the shades of caverns in the rocks, among masses of congealed snow and ice, or in elevated forests on the northern declivities of the most scabrous mountains, where the rays of the sun seldom penetrate. They pasture in the mornings and evenings, and seldom during the day. They traverse the rocks and precipices with great facility, where the dogs dare not follow them. There is nothing more worthy of ad∣miration than to see these animals climbing or descending inaccessible rocks. They neither mount nor descend perpendi∣cularly, but in an oblique line. When descending, particu∣larly, they throw themselves down across a rock, which is near∣ly perpendicular, and of twenty or thirty feet in height, with∣out having a single prop to support their feet. In descend∣ing, they strike their feet three or four times against the rock, till they arrive at a proper resting-place below. The spring of their tendons is so great, that, when leaping about among the precipices, one would imagine they had wings instead of limbs. It has been alledged, that the chamois, in climbing and descending rocks, supports himself by his horns. I have seen and killed many of these animals; but I never saw them use their horns for this purpose; neither did I ever hear the fact supported by any hunter. It is by the strength and agi∣lity of his limbs that the chamois is enabled to climb and de∣scend rocks. His legs are very free and tall; those behind are somewhat longer, and always crooked, which favours their springing to a great distance; and, when they throw them∣selves from a height, the hind legs receive the shock, and per∣form the office of two springs in breaking the fall. It is said, that, when there are numbers of chamois goats together, one is deputed to stand sentinel, for the protection of the rest. I have seen many flocks of them, but never observed this part of their oeconomy. It is true, that, when there are many of them, some always watch while others eat; but I remarked nothing more singular here than what happens in a flock of sheep: For the first who perceives any thing alarming, ad∣vertises the rest, and, in an instant, the same terror is communi∣cated to the whole. In great snows, and during the rigour of winter, the chamois goats inhabit the lower forests, and live upon pine leaves, the buds of trees, bushes, and such green or dry herbs as they can find by scratching off the snow with their feet. The forests that delight them most, are those which are very full of rocks and precipices. The hunting of the chamois is very difficult and laborious. The mode most in use is to kill them by surprise. The hunters con∣ceal themselves behind rocks or large stones, taking care that the wind blows opposite to them, and, when a favourable op∣portunity occurs, shoot them with musket-balls. They are likewise hunted in the same manner as stags and other ani∣mals, by posting some of the hunters in narrow passages, while others beat about to raise the game. Men are prefer∣able for this purpose to dogs; for dogs too quickly dis∣perse the animals, who fly off suddenly to the distance of four or five leagues.” See also on this subject <HI>La troisieme descript. du Voyage des Alpes de Schechuzer, p.</HI> 11.</NOTE>. They are
<PB N="386" REF="431"/>
more numerous, and go generally in flocks. In
the Alps and Pyrennees, however, they are not
<PB N="387" REF="432"/>
now so frequent as formerly. The term <HI>cha∣moiseurs,</HI>
which was applied to all transporters of

With regard to the specific virtue attributed
to the blood of the wild goat, against certain
diseases, and particularly the pleurisy, a virtue
which is thought to be peculiar to this animal,
and which, of course, would lead us to think it
to be of a peculiar nature; it has been discover∣ed,
that the blood of the chamois<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above p. 386.</NOTE>, and like∣wise
that of the domestic he-goat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See l'Hist. des animaux, par Mess. Arnault de Nobleville <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Salerne, tom. 4. p. 243.</NOTE>, have the

with the same aromatic herbs; so that even this
property seems to unite these three animals in
the same species.</P>

<P>We here give a figure of a Juda buck, which
appears to be different from that published in
the original work. M. Bourgelat had it alive,

and still keeps its skin in his anatomical cabinet.
It was considerably larger than the one former∣ly
engraved. It was two feet nine inches long,
and one foot seven inches high, while the o∣ther
was only twenty-four inches and a half
long, and seventeen inches high. The head
and whole body were covered with large white
hairs. The points of the nostrils were black.
The horns nearly touch each other at the base,
and then recede. They are much longer than
those of the former, which the present one re∣sembles
in the feet and hoofs. These diffe∣rences
are too slight to constitute two distinct
species. They seem to be only varieties of the
same species.</P>
<P>We formerly mentioned Syrian goats with
pendulous ears, which were nearly of the same
size with the domestic kind, and produced with
them even in our climate. In Madagascar
there is a goat considerably larger, with pen∣dulous
ears so long, that, when they fall down,
they cover the eyes, which obliges the animal
to move its head almost continually in throw∣ing
them back. Hence, when pursued, it al∣ways
endeavours to ascend. This notice was
communicated to us by M. Comerson; but it
is too imperfect to enable us to determine whe∣ther
this goat belongs to the Syrian race with
pendulous ears, or to a different species.</P>

“The goats which were left on Ascension
island have multiplied greatly; but they are
very meager, especially in the dry season.
The whole island is beaten with their tracks.
During the night, they retire into the exca∣vations

as the common goat. They are so weak, that
men sometimes seize them in the chace. Their
hair is generally of a deep brown colour.”</P>

They are of a pale yellow colour, and the greatest part semipellucid. The length of the animal is four feet nine inches and a quarter; the height before, two feet six inches and a half, and behind, two feet seven inches and a half. The tail is three inches long. The head is like that of a sheep; the nose is very large, arched, and marked the whole length with a small line, caused by the elevation of the <HI>septum narium.</HI> The nostrils are tubular and large. The upper lip hangs over the under. The nose is formed of a muscular substance mixed with fat. The cutting teeth are so loose in their sockets, as to move with the least touch. The male is covered with rough hair, like the he-goat, and has a very strong smell: The female is smoother. The hair on the bottom of the sides and the throat is long, and re∣sembles wool; that on the sides of the head and neck is hoary. The back and sides are of a dirty white colour. The breast, belly, and inside of the thighs, are of a shining white. The females are hornless and timid: If attacked by wolves or dogs, the males place the females in the centre, and de∣fend them stoutly. They bleat like sheep. Their common pace is a trot; when they go faster, it is by leaps, and they are swifter than roebucks. When they feed, they lift up the upper mandible, and go backward; <HI>Pennant's Synops▪ of quad. p.</HI> 35.</P>

<P>IN Hungary, Poland, Tartary, and the sou∣thern

goat, called <HI>Seigah</HI> or <HI>Saiga</HI> by the Russians,
which, in the figure of the body and the hair,
<PB N="394" REF="446"/>
resembles the domestic goat. But the form of
its horns and the want of a beard make it ap∣proach
nearer to the antilopes; and, indeed, it
seems to constitute the shade between these two
kinds of animals; for the horns of the saigae
are perfectly similar in figure, transverse rings,
longitudinal furrows, &amp;c. to those of the anti∣lope,
and they differ in colour only. The horns
of all the antilopes are black and opaque; but

It is known in no other part of Siberia; for what is called <HI>Saiga</HI> in the province of Irkutzk is the musk... The taste of its flesh, it is said, resembles that of the stag; <HI>Voyage de Gmelin à Kamtschatka, tom. 1. p. 179.—Note.</HI> M. Gmelin has since published a more comprehensive description of the saiga, in the first volume of the New Memoirs of the Academy of Petersburg, under the name of <HI>ibex imberbis;</HI> but he has given no figure of it. M. Gmelin remarks, that this animal has the head of a ram, with a higher and more prominent nose, and the body of a stag, but smaller; for it never reaches the size of a roebuck. The horns are yellowish and transparent, a foot in length, ringed toward the base, and situated above the eyes. The ears are erect, pretty large, and terminate in a point. In the under jaw, there are four cutting, four canine, and five grinding teeth, each of the last having two roots. In the upper jaw there are an equal number of cutting and canine teeth, but only four grinders, each of which has three roots. The neck is pretty long. The hind are longer than the fore legs. The foot is cloven. The female has four paps. The tail is thin, and about three inches long. The hair, like that of the stag, is of a yellowish brown colour on the body, and white under the belly. The female is smaller than the male, and has no horns.... Worms breed under their skin.... These animals copulate in autumn, and bring forth one or two young in the spring. They live upon herbage, and are very fat when the rutting season commences. In summer, they inhabit the plains along the banks of the Irtis. In winter, they go to the higher grounds; and they are found not only about the Irtis, but in all the countries watered by the Boris∣thenes, the Don, and the Wolga; <HI>Vide Nov. Com. Acad, Petrop. tom. 5. p.</HI> 345.—The secretary of the Petersburg Academy adds to what M. Gmelin has remarked, that the saiga goes backward when he feeds.... That their horns are pur∣chased by the Chinese to make lanthorns.... That they are only found under the 54th degree of latitude; and that, in the East, there are none beyond the river Oby; <HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 35.</NOTE>. The horns in the Royal cabinet

that they are used for the same purposes as shells.
In natural dispositions, the saiga has a greater
resemblance to the antilopes than to the wild
and chamois goats; for he does not frequent
the mountains, but, like the antilopes, lives on
the hills and plains. Like them, he is extreme∣ly
swift, and his motion consists of bounds or
leaps. His flesh is also better than that of either
the wild or domestic goat.</P>

<PB N="398" REF="450"/>
Barbary, and in all the northern parts of Africa.
The horns of this antilope are about a foot in
length. They have entire rings at their base, and
then half rings till within a small distance from
the extremities, which are smooth and pointed.
They are not only surrounded with rings, but
furrowed longitudinally. The rings mark the
years of growth, and they are commonly from
twelve to thirteen in number. The antilopes
in general, and this species in particular, have a
great resemblance to the roebuck in figure, na∣tural
functions, nimbleness of movement, viva∣city,
largeness of the eyes, &amp;c. And, as the
roebuck exists not in the countries inhabited
by the antilope, we would at first be led to con∣clude,
that it is only a degenerated roebuck, or
that the roebuck is an antilope whose nature
has been changed by the effects of climate and
food. But the antilopes differ from the roebuck
in the substance of their horns. Those of the
roebuck are a kind of solid <HI>wood,</HI> which falls off
and is renewed annually, like that of the stag.
The horns of the antilopes, on the contrary, are
hollow and permanent, like those of the goat.
Besides, the roebuck has no gall-bladder. The
antilopes, as well as the roebucks, have hollows
before the eyes. They resemble each other still
more in the quality of the hair, in the white∣ness
of the buttocks, and in the tufts on their
legs; but, in the roebuck, these tufts are on the
hind-legs, and on the fore legs of the antilopes
Hence the antilopes seem to be intermediate
<PB N="399" REF="451"/>
animals between the roebuck and goat. But,
when it is considered that the roebuck exists e∣qually
in both Continents, and that the goats,
as well as the antilopes, are peculiar to the Old
World, we are led to think, that the goats and
antilopes are more allied to each other than they
are to the roebuck. Besides, the only characters
peculiar to the antilopes are the transverse rings
and longitudinal furrows on the horns; the tufts
of hair on the fore-legs; a thick and well de∣fined
band of black, brown, or reddish hairs be∣low
the flanks; and, lastly, three stripes of
whitish hairs, which extend longitudinally up∣on
the internal surface of the ears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Algazel ex Africa, animal exoticum... ex Africa Nea∣polim missum; magnitudine Capreae, <HI>Capreoli</HI> dicti, cui toto habitu prima facie simile, nisi quod cornibus nulli magis quam hirco similioribus sit praeditum....

The second antilope is found in Senegal,
where, according to Mr Adanson, it is called
<HI>kevel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The horns of the kevel, or flat-horned antilope, are shaped like those of the last, but flatted on their sides. The rings are more numerous, being from fourteen to eighteen.

<P>Antilope kevella; <HI>Pallas, Miscell. 7. spicil.</HI> 12.</P></NOTE>. It is less than the common kind, and
is nearly of the size of our small roebucks. Its
eyes are also larger than those of the gazelle, and
its horns, instead of being round, are flattened
on the sides. This compression of the horns
proceeds not from a difference of sex; for, in
both males and females, the horns of the one
species are round, and of the other flat. In every
other article, the resemblance is complete. The
kevel, like the gazelle, has short yellow hair,
white belly and thighs, a black tail, a brown
band under the flanks, three white stripes on the
ears, black horns surrounded with rings, longi∣tudinal
furrows between the rings, &amp;c. The
number of these rings, however, is greater in the
kevel than in the gazelle; for the latter has ge∣nerally
twelve or thirteen, and the former at
least fourteen, and often eighteen.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="453"/>
The third antilope we shall denominate <HI>corine</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The corine, or spotted antilope, has very slender horns, six inches long, and surrounded with circular <HI>rugae.</HI> It is less than a roebuck. On each side of the face there is a white line. The neck, body, and flanks, are tawny; the belly and inside of the thighs white, which is separated from the sides by a dark line. On the knees there is a tuft of hair. Some are irregularly spotted with white. Perhaps these are the spotted goats of Kolben, tom. 2. p. 115.; <HI>Pennant's Synops. of quad. p.</HI> 37.</NOTE>,
from the name <HI>korin,</HI> which it bears, according
to M. Adanson, in Senegal. It has a great re∣semblance
to the gazelle and kevel. But it is
still smaller than the kevel, and its horns are
thinner, shorter, and smoother, the rings which
encircle them being hardly perceptible. M.
Adanson, who communicated to me his descrip∣tion
of this animal, says, that it appeared to par∣take
somewhat of the chamois goat, but that it
was much smaller, being only two feet and a
half long, and less than two feet high; that his
ears are four inches and a half in length, the tail
three inches, the horns six inches long, and on∣ly
half an inch thick; that they are two inches
asunder at the base, and from five to six at their
extremities; that, instead of rings, they have cir∣cular
<HI>rugae,</HI> very near each other in the inferior
part, and more distant in the superior; that these
<HI>rugae,</HI> which hold the place of rings, are about
sixteen in number; that the hair of this animal,
which is short, shining, and close set, is yellow
on the back and flanks, white on the belly and
<PB N="402" REF="454"/>
the inside of the thighs; that the tail is black;
and that, in the same species, some individuals
have white spots scattered over their bodies
without any order.</P>
<P>These differences between the gazelle, the
kevel, and the corine, though very conspicuous,
seem to be neither essential, nor sufficient to
make these animals three distinct species. In
every other respect, they resemble each other so
strongly, that they appear to be of the same spe∣cies,
varied a little by the influence of climate
and food; for the kevel and gazelle differ less
from one another than from the corine, whose
horns resemble not those of the other two. But
all the three have the same natural habits; they
go in troops, associate together, and feed in the
same manner; their dispositions are gentle; they
are easily accustomed to a domestic state; and
their flesh makes excellent eating. We may,
therefore, conclude, that the gazelle and kevel
certainly belong to the same species, and that it
is doubtful whether the corine be a variety only
of the same, or really constitutes a distinct
species.</P>
<P>In the royal cabinet, there are spoils, either
entire or partial, of these three antilopes. We
have likewise a horn, which greatly resembles
those of the gazelle and kevel, but it is much lar∣ger.
This horn is also engraven by Aldrovan∣dus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. de bisulcis, cap. 21.</NOTE>.
Its thickness and length seem to indicate
<PB N="403" REF="455"/>
an animal of greater magnitude than the com∣mon
antilope; and I imagine it belongs to an
antilope called <HI>tzeiran</HI> by the Turks, and <HI>ahu</HI>
by the Persians. This animal, says Olearius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We saw daily great numbers of a species of stag, called <HI>Tzeiran</HI> by the Turks and <HI>Ahu</HI> by the Persians.

What is singular in this animal, that, in proportion as his horns grow, the size of the <HI>larinx,</HI> or <HI>pomum Adami,</HI> augments; so that, when old, he has a considerable swelling on his throat. Dr Messerschmid asserts that this roebuck has an absolute aversion to water. But the inhabitants of Tongus assured me, that, when hunted, he often takes to the water, in order to make his escape; and Brigadier Bucholz, at Selenginsck, told me, that he had tamed one completely; that it followed his servant when swimming; and that it often went to an island in the river Selinga, which it never would have done, if it had a natural aversion to water. These roebucks are as swift as the saigas on the borders of the Irtis; <HI>Voyage de M. Gmelin en Siberie, tom. 2. p.</HI> 103.—M. Gmelin has since given a more complete description of this animal, in the New Pe∣tersburg Memoirs, under the appellation of <HI>Caprea campestris gutturosa,</HI> of which the following is an abridgment:—This animal resembles the roebuck in figure, size, colour, and man∣ner of going.... It has no cutting teeth in the under jaw. The male differs from the female by having horns and a pro∣tuberance on the throat. The horns are somewhat compres∣sed at the base. They have rings for a great part of their length; they are smooth at the points; and they are blackish, but perfectly black at the extremities. They are permanent, and shed not, like those of the roebuck.... Upon the throat of the male, there is a large protuberance of five inches in length, and three in breadth: It is smaller when the animals are young, and is not perceptible till they are near a year old. Its growth keeps pace with that of the horns.... This protuberance is occasioned by the structure of the larynx and the orifice of the trachea, which are very large.... The fe∣male is perfectly similar to the female roe.... This animal differs from the <HI>Ibex imberbis,</HI> or <HI>saiga:</HI> The nose of the saiga is large and split like that of the ram; but the nose of this animal is entire and pointed, like that of the roebuck....

in this figure, the horns are neither sufficiently
long nor straight. Besides, his description is by
no means exact; for he says that this bezoar ani∣mal
has a beard like the he-goat, though he has
given it no beard in his figure; which is more
consonant to truth, the want of a beard being
the chief characteristic by which the antilopes
are distinguished from the goats. This antilope
is of the size of our domestic he-goat, and it re∣sembles
the stag in figure, colour, and agility.
Beside two separate horns, we have seen a head
of this animal to which the horns were attached.
The horns engraven in Aldrovandus's work
have a great resemblance to those of the pasan.
In general, the algazel and pasan seem to be ve∣ry
nearly allied. They likewise belong to the same
climate, and are found in the Levant, Egypt,
Persia, Arabia, &amp;c. But the algazel inhabits the
plains, and the pasan the mountains. The flesh
of both is excellent.</P>

It is of the figure and colour of a roebuck, be∣ing
yellow on the upper part of the body, white
on the belly and thighs, with a white spot under
the neck. Its horns are permanent, like those
of the other antilopes, and exceed not six or se∣ven
inches in length. They are black and round;
but, what is singular, they bend forward at the
points, nearly in the same manner as those of
the chamois goat bend backward. The nanguer,
or swift antilope, is a very handsome animal,
and easily tamed. All these characters, and
chiefly that of the horns bending forward, in∣cline
me to think that the nanguer may be the
<HI>dama</HI> or fallow deer of the antients. “Cornua
rupicapris in dorsum adunca, damis in adver∣sum,”
says Pliny<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nat. lib 11. cap. 37.</NOTE>. Now, the nanguers are the
only animals whose horns are bended in this
manner; we may therefore presume, that the
nanguer of Africa is the dama of the antients,
especially as we learn from another passage of
<PB N="411" REF="463"/>
Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunt et damae, et pygargi, et strepsicerotes.—Haec transmarini situs mittunt; <HI>Hist. Nat. lib. 8. cap.</HI> 53.</NOTE>, that the dama was found only in Africa.
In fine, from the testimony of other antient au∣thors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Horace, Virgil, Martial, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
we see that the dama was a timid, gentle
animal, and had no other resources but in the
swiftness of its course. The animal described
and engraven by Caius, under the name of <HI>dama
Plinii,</HI> being found, according to the testimony
of the same author, in the North of Great Bri∣tain
and in Spain, could not be the dama of
Pliny, since he tells us that it was only to be
met with in Africa<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haec icon Damae est quam ex caprarum genere indicat pilus, aruncus, figura corporis atque cornua, nisi quod his in adversum adunca, cum caeteris in aversum acta sint.

by Caius has a beard like a goat; but none of
the antients mention the dama as having a beard.
Hence I am led to think, that the dama descri∣bed
by Caius, is only a goat, whose horns being
a little bended at the points, like those of the
common antilope, made him imagine it to be
the dama of the antients. Besides, the horns
bended forward, which is the distinguishing cha∣racter
of the dama of the antients, are well mark∣ed
in the nanguer of Africa only. We are like∣wise
informed by M. Adanson, that there are three
<PB N="412" REF="464"/>
varieties of those nanguers, which differ only
in colour; but all their horns are more or less
bended forward.</P>

It is of the size of our largest roebucks.
Though it has a great resemblance to the gazelle
and kevel; yet it differs in so many characters,
that it ought to be regarded as a distinct species.
The pits below the eyes are larger in the <HI>anti∣lope</HI>
than in the gazelle. Its horns are almost
fourteen inches long; and, though they al∣most
touch at the base, yet their points are fif∣teen
or sixteen inches asunder. They are sur∣rounded
with rings and half rings, which are
<PB N="413" REF="465"/>
less raised than those of the gazelle and ke∣vel;
and, what is peculiar to the <HI>antilope,</HI> its
horns have a remarkably beautiful double flexion,
which gives them the appearance of the antient
lyre. The hair of the <HI>antilope,</HI> like that of the
other gazelles, is yellow on the back, and white
on the belly: But these two colours are not
separated below the flanks by a brown or black
band, as in the gazelle, kevel, corine, &amp;c. We
have only a skeleton of this animal in the royal
cabinet.</P>
<P>In the <HI>antilope,</HI> as well as the other gazelles,
there seem to be different races. 1. In the roy∣al
cabinet, there is a horn which can only be at∣tributed
to an antilope of a much larger size
than that we have been describing. We shall
adopt the name <HI>Lidmée</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Lidmée, or brown antilope, is less than a roebuck; its horns resemble those of the last. Its face, back, and sides, are of a very deep brown, the last bordered with tawny. The belly and inside of the legs are white. Above each hoof, there is a black spot. The tail is black above, and white be∣neath; <HI>Pennat's synops. of quad. p.</HI> 32.</NOTE>, which, according to
Dr Shaw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Besides the common gazelle or antilope, (which is well known in Europe,) this country likewise produceth another species, of the same shape and colour, though of the bigness of our roebuck, and with horns sometimes of two feet long. This the Africans call <HI>Lidmée,</HI> and may, I presume, be the <HI>Strepsiceros</HI> and <HI>Adace</HI> of the antients; <HI>Shaw's travels, p.</HI> 243.</NOTE>, the Africans apply to the <HI>Antilopes.</HI>
2. We have seen in the cabinet of the Marquis
de Marigny, whose taste extends both to the
fine arts and to the history of Nature, a kind of
<PB N="414" REF="466"/>
offensive weapon, composed of two sharp horns,
about a foot and a half long, which, from their
double flexion, appear to belong to an <HI>antilope</HI>
smaller than the others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr Pennant calls this the</HI> sincoth-horned antilope; Synops. of quad. p. 33.</NOTE>. It must be very
common in India; for the Priests<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Indian antilopes are not entirely like those of other countries. They have more spirit; and are distinguishable by their horns. In the common antilopes, the horns are gray, and not half so long as those of India, which are black, and more than a foot and a half in length. They are twisted, as far as the points, like a screw. The Faquirs and Santons generally carry two of them joined together in a parallel di∣rection, and use them as small batons; <HI>Relat. du voyage de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 111.—Those in the Marquis de Marigny's cabinet are neither twisted nor annulated: They seem to have been polished from one end to the other.</NOTE> carry this
kind of weapon as a mark of dignity. We
shall call it the <HI>Indian antilope,</HI> because it ap∣pears
to be only a simple variety of the African species.</P>
<P>Thus, among the gazelles or antilopes, we
have discovered twelve species, or distinct va∣rieties.
1. The common gazelle; 2. The ke∣vel;
3. The corine; 4. The tzeiran; 5. The
koba, or great brown cow; 6. The kob, or
small brown cow; 7. The algazel, or Egyptian
antilope; 8. The pasan, or pretended bezoar
animal; 9. The nanguer, or dama of the an∣tients;
10. The <HI>antilope;</HI> 11. The lidmée;
12. The Indian <HI>antilope.</HI> After a careful com∣parison
of these twelve animals among them∣selves,
<PB N="415" REF="467"/>
we are led to conclude, 1. That the com∣mon
gazelle, the kevel, and the corine, are only
three varieties of the same species; 2. That
the tzeiran, koba, and kob, are varieties of ano∣ther
species; 3. That the algazel and pasan are
probably two varieties of the same species; and
that the name of <HI>bezoar gazelle,</HI> which has been
given to the pasan, is not a distinctive character;
for I shall afterwards prove, that the Oriental
bezoar is not produced by the pasan alone,
but by all the gazelles and goats which inhabit
the mountains of Asia; 4. That the nanguers,
whose horns are bended forward, and of which
there are two or three varieties, have been point∣ed
out by the antients under the name of <HI>dama;</HI>
5. That the <HI>antilopes,</HI> which are three or four
in number, and differ from all the others by the
double flexion of their horns, were likewise known
to the antients, and mentioned under the names
of <HI>Strepsiceros</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Erecta autem cornua, rugarumque ambitu contorta, et in leve fastigium exacuta (ut Lyras diceres) Strepsiceroti, quem Addacem Africa appellat; <HI>Plin. Hist. nat, lib. 11. cap.</HI> 37.</NOTE> and <HI>addax.</HI> All these animals
are found in Asia and Africa. To these five
principal species, which contain twelve distinct
varieties, I will not add two or three other spe∣cies
of the New World, to which the vague
name of <HI>gazelle,</HI> or <HI>antilope,</HI> has been given,
though they differ from all those formerly ta∣ken
notice of. This would be to augment a con∣fusion
which is already two great. In the sub∣sequent
<PB N="416" REF="468"/>
article, we shall give the history of these
American animals under their true names, <HI>Ma∣zame,
Temamaçame,</HI> &amp;c. and shall here confine
ourselves entirely to the animals of this genus
which are found in Africa and Asia: For the
same reason, we shall refer to the following
article several other African and Asiatic animals,
which have been regarded as antilopes or goats,
though they appear to be intermediate species,
such as the bubalus, or Barbary cow, the con∣doma,
the guib, the grimm, &amp;c. without inclu∣ding
the chevrotains or musks, which have a
great resemblance to the smallest goats or anti∣lopes:
Of these last we shall likewise make a
separate article.</P>
<P>It is now easy to perceive the difficulty of ar∣ranging
and distinguishing all these animals,
which are thirty in number, ten goats, twelve or
thirteen antilopes, three or four bubali, and as
many musks. Many of them were unknown
to the naturalists, or exhibited in promiscuous
groups; and the whole have been confounded
with each other by travellers. This, indeed, is
the third time I have written the history of
these animals; and, I acknowledge, that the
labour overbalances the produce. I have the
satisfaction, however, of having made every
possible use of the knowledge and materials I
could acquire.</P>
<P>With regard to the gazelles, from comparing
all that has been said of them, both by the an∣tients
<PB N="417" REF="469"/>
and moderns, with our own experience,
we find, 1. That the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Aristotle is not the
gazelle, but the roebuck; though the same word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> has been employed by Aelian, not only
to denote the wild goats in general, but parti∣cularly
the Lybian gazelle or Barbary antilope;
2. That the <HI>strepsiceros</HI> of Pliny, or <HI>addax</HI> of
the Africans, is the <HI>antilope;</HI> 3. That the <HI>da∣ma</HI>
of Pliny is the <HI>nanguer</HI> of Africa, and not
our fallow deer, or any other European animal;
4. That the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Aristotle is the same with the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Aelian, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the more mo∣dern
Greeks; and that the Latins have used this
word <HI>platyceros</HI> to denote the fallow deer;
“animalium,” says Pliny, “quorundam cornua
in palmas finxit natura, digitosque emisit ex
iis, unde <HI>platycerotas</HI> vocant;” 5. That the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Greeks is probably the Egyptian
or Persian gazelle, that is, the <HI>algazel</HI> or <HI>pasan.</HI>
The word <HI>pygargus</HI> is employed by Aristotle
solely to denote the <HI>white tailed eagle;</HI> and Pliny
has used the same word to denote a quadruped.
Now, the etymology of <HI>pygargus</HI> indicates, 1.
An animal with white thighs, such as the roe∣bucks,
or gazelles; 2. A timid animal; the an∣tients,
imagining that white thighs indicated ti∣midity,
ascribed the intrepidity of Hercules to
his having black thighs. But, as almost all the
authors who speak of the <HI>pygargus</HI> as a qua∣druped,
mention likewise the roebuck, it is ob∣vious,
that the name <HI>pygargus</HI> can only apply
<PB N="418" REF="470"/>
to some species of gazelle different from the
<HI>dorcas Lybica,</HI> or common gazelle, and from the
<HI>strepsiceros</HI> or <HI>antilope,</HI> which are also mentioned
by the same authors. We are, therefore, led to
conclude, that the <HI>pygargus</HI> denotes the algazel
or Egyptian gazelle, which must have been
known to the Greeks as well as the Hebrews;
for we find the name <HI>pygargus</HI> applied, in the
Septuagint version<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deutron. chap. 14.</NOTE>, to a quadruped which is rec∣koned
among the pure animals whose flesh might
be eaten. Hence the Jews eat the <HI>pygargus,</HI> or
that species of gazelle which is most common in
Egypt and the adjacent countries.</P>
<P>Dr Russel, in his Natural History of Aleppo,
tells us, that, in the neighbourhood of that city,
there are two kinds of gazelles. The one, called
the <HI>mountain gazelle,</HI> which is the most beauti∣ful,
and whose hair on the neck and back is of a
deep brown colour; the other, called <HI>the gazelle
of the plains,</HI> which is neither so nimble, nor so
handsome as the first, and whose hair is of a
pale colour. He adds, that these animals are so
swift, and run so long, that the best hounds
cannot take them, without the assistance of a
falcon; that, though the gazelles are meager in
winter, their flesh is excellent; that, in summer,
it is loaded with fat like that of the fallow deer;
that those fed in houses are not such good
eating as the wild ones, &amp;c. From the testimo∣nies
<PB N="419" REF="471"/>
of Mr Russel and of Hasselquist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Capra Cervicapra. <HI>The rock goat.</HI></P>
<P>This is larger, swifter, and wilder, than the common rock goat, and can scarcely be taken without a falcon. It is met with near Aleppo. I have seen a variety of this, which is common in the East, and the horns appear different; per∣haps it is a distinct species. This animal loves the smoke of tobacco, and, when caught alive, will approach the pipe of the huntsman, though otherwise more timid than any animal. This is perhaps the only creature, beside man, that delights in the smell of a poisonous and stinking plant. The Arabians hunt it with a falcon (Falco gentilis, Linn.) I had an ex∣cellent opportunity of seeing this sport near Nazareth, in Ga∣lilee. An Arab, mounting a swift courser, held the falcon on his hand, as huntsmen commonly do: When we espied the rock goat, on the top of a mountain, he let loose the falcon, which flew in a direct line, like an arrow, and attacked the ani∣mal, fixing the talons of one of his feet, into the cheek of the creature, and the talons of the other into its throat, extend∣ing his wings obliquely over the animal; spreading one to∣wards one of its ears, and the other to the opposite hip. The animal, thus attacked, made a leap twice the height of a man, and freed himself from the falcon; but, being wounded, and losing its strength and speed, it was again attacked by the falcon, which fixed the talons of both its feet into the throat of the animal, and held it fad, till the huntsman coming up, took it alive, and cut its throat; the falcon drinking the blood, as a reward for his labour; and a young falcon, which was learning, was likewise put to the throat of the goat; by this means are young falcons taught to fix their talons in the throat of the animal, as being the properest part; for, should the falcon six them in the creature's hip, or some other part of the body, the huntsman would not only lose his game, but his falcon also: For the animal, roused by the wound, which could not prove mortal, would run to the deserts, and the tops of the mountains, whither its enemy keeping its hold, would be obliged to follow; and, being separated from its master, must of course perish; <HI>Hasselquist, p.</HI> 190.</P></NOTE>, we learn
that the gazelles of Aleppo are not the com∣mon
<PB N="420" REF="472"/>
kind, but the Egyptian gazelles, whose horns
are upright, long, and black, and whose flesh is
extremely good; and that they are half-do∣mestic,
having been often and very antiently
tamed, which, of course, has given rise to a
great number of varieties, or different races, as
happens in all other domestic animals. These
Aleppo gazelles, therefore, are the same with
those we have called <HI>algazelles.</HI> They are still
more common in the Thebaid and Upper Egypt,
than in the environs of Aleppo. They feed upon
aromatic herbs, and the buds of trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relat. du Voyage fait ou Egypt, par Granger, p. 99.</NOTE>. They ge∣nerally
go in flocks, or rather in families, consisting
of five or six<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Egypt there are a number of antilopes.—They commonly traverse the mountains in flocks. The hair and tail of these animals resemble those of the hind; and their fore-feet, which are short, resemble that of the fallow deer.

Nat. Egypt, p. 232. tab. 14. Note:.</HI> From the figure given by Prosper Alpinus, it is obvious, that it is the <HI>algazel</HI> of which he is treating; and his description shows that the algazel is often, as well as the common gazelle and kevel, marked with white spots, like the civet.—In India there are numbers of gazelles, which resemble our fawns. They generally go in separate flocks, each consisting of five or six, and accompanied with a male, who is easily distinguished by his colour. When the hunters discover one of these flocks, they endeavour to point them out to the leopard, which they keep chained in a small cart. This cunning animal does not run straight upon them, but winds about, creeping and concealing himself, in order to approach and surprise them; and, as he is capable of ma∣king five or six bounds with inconceivable quickness, when he thinks himself near enough, he darts upon them, tears open the throat and breast, and gluts himself with their blood, heart, and liver. But, if he misses his aim, which often happens, he remains fixed on the spot. It would be in vain to attempt to seize them by running; for they run much swifter and con∣tinue much longer than he can do. His master then comes gently up to him, flatters him, and throw pieces of flesh to him. By amusing the animal in this manner, he is enabled to throw a cover over his eyes: After which, he chains him, and replaces him on the cart. In the course of our march, one of these leopards exhibited this sport to us, which alarm∣ed several of our people. A flock of gazelles rose in the midst of the army, and, as often happens, they accidentally pas∣sed near the two leopards, which are commonly carried a∣long on a small cart. One of them, which was not hood∣winked, made such a spring, that he broke his chain, and darted after them, but without effect. However, as the ga∣zelles were terrified, and chaced on all sides, one of them was again obliged to pass near the leopard, who, notwithstanding the whole road was embarassed with camels and horses, and notwithstanding the common notion that this animal never attacks its prey after having once missed it, he sprung upon, and seized it; <HI>Relat. de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 112.</NOTE>, which we have called <HI>ounce.</HI> In some

ones, with snares of ropes fixed to their
horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Instead of a leopard, a tamed gazelle is employed to catch the wild ones. Round his horns a rope is twisted in various directions, and the two ends of it are fixed under his belly. When the hunters discover a flock of gazelles, he is allowed to go and join them. But the male of the little flock advances to prevent him: This opposition he makes with his horns, which are soon entangled in the mesh of ropes. He is then seized and carried off by the hunters; <HI>Id. ibid.</HI>—The same art is employed in taking the females. A domestic female with a netting of cords is let loose among a flock. The wild females immediately begin to sport with her; and the horns of one of them are soon entangled; and she falls an easy prey to the Indians; <HI>Voyage de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p.</HI> 247.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The antilopes, especially the larger kinds, are
much more common in Africa than in India.
They arc stronger and fiercer than the other
gazelles; and they are easily distinguished by the
double flexion of their horns, and by the
want of a black or brown band below the
flanks. The middling antilopes are of the size
of a fallow deer. Their horns are very black<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 53. and Shaw's travels.</NOTE>,

places, they look round on all sides; and, as
soon as they perceive a man, a dog, or any other
enemy, they fly off with full speed. But, not withstanding
this natural timidity, they have a
kind of courage; for, when surprised, they stop
short, and face those who attack them.</P>

delicate than those of the roebuck. Their hair
is short, soft, and lustrous. Their fore legs are
not so long as the hind ones, which enables

runs, whereas all the gazelles run uniform∣ly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The hair of the <HI>gierans</HI> or <HI>gazelles</HI> is like that of the fal∣low-deer, and they run, like the dog, without leaping.

animal which produces the <HI>Oriental bezoar</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Golconda, the King has great store of excellent be∣zoars. The mountains where the goats feed which produce these stones, are about seven or eight days journey from Bag∣nagaar. They commonly sell at forty crowns a pound; and the longest kind are the best. They are likewise found in certain cows, which are much larger, though not so valuable as those produced by the goats. The bezoars extracted from a rare kind of apes, which are small and long, are in the highest estimation; <HI>Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 3. p.</HI> 293.—Per∣sia produces finer Bezoar stones than any other country of the world. They are extracted from the sides of certain wild he goats, to the livers of which they are attached; <HI>Voyage de Feynes, p.</HI> 44.—The bezoar, that famous medicinal stone, ought to be ranked among the number of drugs. It is a ten∣der stone, con∣sisting of coats or pellicles, like an onion. It is found in the bodies of the wild and domestic goats along the gulf of Persia, in the province of Corasson, which is the an∣tient Margiana, and is incomparably better than that brought from the kingdom of Golconda. But, as the goats were brought from a distance of three days journey, we found be∣zoars in some of them only, and even that in small quantities. We preserved these goats alive fifteen days. They were fed with common green herbage; but, upon opening them, no∣thing was found. I kept them during this time, in order to discover whether, as is alledged, it be a particular herb which heats these ani∣mal, and produces this stone in their bodies. We are told by the natives of Persia, that the more this animal pastures in parched countries, and eats dry and aromatic herbs, the bezoar is the more salutary. Corasson and the bor∣ders of the Persian gulf are the driest countries in the world. In the heart of these stones, there are always pieces of brambles, or some other vegetable, that serve as a nucleus, round which the humour that composes this stone coagulates. It is wor∣thy of remark, that, in India, the she-goats produce bezoar, and that, in Persia, it is produced by the wedders and he-goats. The Persians esteem their own bezoar, being hotter and better concocted, as four times more valuable than the In∣dian kind. The former they sell at fifty-four livres the kou∣rag, which is a weight of three drachms; <HI>Voyage de Chardin, tom. 2. p.</HI> 16.—The oriental bezoar comes from a northern province of the kingdom of Golconda, and is found in the stomach of she-goats.—The peasants, by feeling the belly of the goat, know how many bezoars she has, and sell her in proportion to their number. This number they dis∣cover, by rubbing the sides of the stomach with their hands in such a manner as to bring all the contents towards the middle of it, and then they feel the stones distinctly.—The bezoar, like the diamond, is valued according to its size; for, if five or six bezoars weigh an ounce, they bring from fif∣teen to eighteen francs. But, if one bezoar weighs an ounce, it sells at one hundred francs. I sold one of four ounces and a half at two thousand livres.—The merchants who traffic in bezoars, brought me six of these goats, which I exa∣mined. It must be acknowledged that these animals are beautiful, very tall, and have hair as fine as silk.—I was told that one of these goats had but one bezoar in its sto∣mach, and that others had two, three, or four, which I soon perceived to be true by rubbing their bellies in the manner above described. These six goats had seventeen bezoars and a half, one of which was about the size of half a hazel nut. The inside resembled the soft dung of a goat. These stones grow among the dung in the animal's belly. Some of the natives told me, that the bezoars were attached to the liver, and others, that they were fixed to the heart. From these vagne assertions, I could not learn the truth.—With regard to the bezoar produced by the ape, it is so strong that two grains of it are reckoned equal to fix of that produced by the goat; but it is very rare, and is found principally in the island of Macassar. This kind of bezoar is round; but the other is of different figures. These bezoars which are supposed to come from the apes, are much rarer than the o∣ther kind. They are also much dearer, and in greater re∣quest; and, when one is found of the size of a nut, it some∣times sells at more than a hundred crowns; <HI>Voyage de Taver∣nier, tom. 4. p.</HI> 78.</NOTE>.
If we consult the other naturalists and travellers,
we shall be tempted to believe that all the ga∣zelles,
wild and domestic goats, and even the
sheep, indiscriminately produce this stone, the
formation of which depends more, perhaps, on the
<PB N="427" REF="479"/>

But this notion of Rumphius and Seba is by
<PB N="430" REF="482"/>
no means well founded. We have seen seve∣ral
of these concretions, which are called <HI>ape
bezoars.</HI> But they are totally different from the
oriental bezoar, which unquestionably proceeds
from a ruminating animal, and is easily distin∣guished,
by its form and substance, from all the
other bezoars. Its common colour is a greenish
olive, and brownish within. The colour of
what is called the <HI>occidental bezoar,</HI> is a faint
yellow, more or less dirty. The substance
of the former is more tender and porous,
and that of the latter, harder, drier, and more
petrified. Besides, as prodigious quantities of
the oriental bezoar were consumed during the
last two or three centuries, being used, both in
Europe and Asia, in all cases where our physi∣cians
<PB N="431" REF="483"/>
now employ cordials and antidotes against
poison, may we not presume, from this great
consumption, which still continues in some de∣gree,
that the bezoar proceeds from a very com∣mon
animal, or rather, that it proceeds not from
one, but from several species; and that it is
equally extracted from gazelles, goats, and wed∣ders;
but that these animals can only produce
it in the climates of India and the Levant?</P>
<P>From all that has been written on this sub∣ject,
we have not been able to find one distinct
observation, nor a single decisive argument. It
only appears, from what has been said by Mo∣nard,
Garcias, Clusius, Aldrovandus, Hernandes,
&amp;c. that the oriental bezoar animal is not the
common domestic goat, but a species of wild
goat, which they have not sufficiently characte∣rised.
In the same manner, all we can collect
from Koempfer is, that the bezoar animal is a
kind of wild goat, or rather gazelle, which is e∣qually
ill described. But, from the testimonies
of Thevenot, Chardin, and Tavernier, we learn,
that this stone is not so often extracted from the
gazelles, as from the wedders, and the wild or
domestic goats. These travellers merit the great∣er
credit, because they were eye-witnesses to the
facts they mention, and because, when treating
of the bezoar, though they take no notice of the
gazelles, yet, as they were well acquainted with
these animals, and mention them in other parts
of their works<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p. 26.</NOTE>, there is not the least appearance
<PB N="432" REF="484"/>
of their having been deceived. We must not,
therefore, conclude, like our antient naturalists,
that the oriental bezoar is produced solely by a
particular species of gazelle. I acknowledge, that,
after having examined not only the evidence of
travellers, but the facts themselves which might
decide this question, I am inclined to believe that
the bezoar stone proceeds equally from the most
part of ruminating animals, but more common∣ly
from goats and gazelles. It is formed of con∣centric
coats or strata, and frequently contains
foreign substances in its centre. I endeavoured to
investigate the nature of these substances, which
serve as a nucleus to the bezoar, in order to dis∣cover
the animal that swallowed them. In the
centre of these stones I found small flints, stones
of plums, and of tamarinds, seeds of cas∣sia,
and especially pieces of straw and buds of
trees. Hence I could no longer hesitate in at∣tributing
this production to animals which brouse
herbage and leaves.</P>
<P>We are persuaded, therefore, that the oriental
bezoar proceeds not from any one, but from a
number of different animals. Neither is it diffi∣cult
to reconcile this opinion with the testimo∣nies
of travellers; for, though each of them
contradicts his neighbour; yet all of them make
near approaches to the truth. The bezoar was
unknown to the antient Greeks and Latins.
Galen is the first who mentions its virtues a∣gainst
poison. The Arabians speak of the be∣zoar
<PB N="433" REF="485"/>
as possessing the same virtues. But neither
the Greeks, Latins, nor Arabians, give any pre∣cise
information concerning the animals by which
it is produced. Rabi Moses, the Egyptian, only
remarks, that some people pretend that this stone
is formed in the angle of the eye, and others in
the gall-bladder of the Eastern wedders. Now,
bezoars, or concretions, are actually formed
in the angles of the eyes, and in the pits be∣low
the eyes of stags and some other ani∣mals.
But these concretions are very different
from the oriental bezoar; and all the concre∣tions
in the gall-bladder consist of a light, oily,
and inflammable matter, which has no resem∣blance
to the substance of the bezoar. Andreas
Lacuna, a Spanish physician, in his commenta∣ries
on Dioscorides, remarks, that the oriental
bezoar is extracted from a certain species of wild
goat in the mountains of Persia. Amatus Lusi∣tanus
repeats Lacuna's remark; and adds, that
this mountain goat resembles the stag. Monard,
who quotes all the three, assures us in a more
positive manner, that this stone is derived from
the internal parts of a mountain goat in India, to
which, says he, I may give the appellation of
<HI>cervi-capra;</HI> because it partakes both of the stag
and the goat, is nearly of the size and figure
of the stag, and, like the goat, has simple horns,
very much bended backward<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">Lapis <HI>Bezáar</HI> varias habet appellationes; nam Arabibits <HI>Hager</HI> dicitur, Persis <HI>Bezáar,</HI> Indis <HI>Bezar,...</HI> Iste lapis in in∣ternis partibus cujusdam animalis <HI>Capra montana</HI> appellati generatur.....

repeats what had been said by Garcias and Mo∣nard,
<PB N="436" REF="488"/>
without offering any thing new. In fine,
to omit nothing relative to the history of this
stone, Koempfer, an intelligent man, and an ex∣act
observer, tells us, that, when in the province
of Laar in Persia, he went with the natives of
the country to hunt the buck <HI>pasan,</HI> which pro∣duces
the bezoar; and that he saw the stone
extracted; and he assures us, that the true ori∣ental
bezoar proceeds from this animal; that the
buck <HI>ahu,</HI> of which he also gives a figure, like∣wise
produces bezoar, but that it is of an inferior
quality. From the figures he has given of the
pason and ahu, we would be induced to think,
that the first represents the common gazelle rather
than the true pasan; and, from his description,
we should imagine his pasan to be a he-goat,
and not a gazelle, because he has given it a beard
like the goats. Lastly, from the name <HI>ahu,</HI>
which he gives to his other buck, as well as from
his second figure, we recognise the wild he-goat
rather than the genuine ahu, which is our tzeiran
or large gazelle. What is still more singular,
Koempfer, who seems willing to determine the
species of the oriental bezoar animal, and who
assures us that it is the wild buck called <HI>pasan,</HI>
quotes, at the same time, a man who, he says,
is very worthy of credit, and who affirms, that
he felt the bezoars in the belly of the gazelle, at
Golconda. Thus, all the positive evidence which
can be derived from Koempfer is reduced to this,
that there are two species of wild mountain-goats,
<PB N="437" REF="489"/>
the pasan and ahu, which produce the bezoar in
Persia, and that in India this stone is likewise
found in the gazelles. Chardin remarks, that the
oriental bezoar is found in the bucks and she-goats,
both wild and domestic, along the Persic
Gulf, and in several provinces of India; but that,
in Persia, it is also extracted from the wedders.
The Dutch travellers also assert<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">In the island of Bosner, we find the famous bezoar stone, which is very precious and in great request, on account of its virtue against poison. It is formed, in the stomachs of sheep or goats, round a small pustule or protuberance in the middle of the stomach, and which is found in the stone itself..... A conjecture has been formed, that the bezoar which proceeds from the stomach of the sheep, and the gall-bladder stone of the hog, are produced by the operation of some particu∣lar herbs eaten by these animals. But they are found in all the countries of the East-Indies, though these animals feed promiscuously upon herbage of every kind. <HI>See Voyage de la Compagn. des Indes de Hollande, tom. 2. p.</HI> 121. and also <HI>Le Voy∣age de Mandelslo tom. 2. p.</HI> 364.</NOTE>, that it is pro∣duced
in the stomachs of sheep and goats. Ta∣vernier,
who is still more positive in favour of
the domestic goats, says, that their hair is as fine
as silk, and that, having purchased six of these
goats alive, he extracted from them seventeen
entire bezoars, and a piece of another as large
as half a filbered nut. He then adds, that there
are other bezoars supposed to proceed from apes,
whose virtues are still stronger than those of the
goat-bezoars; that they are also extracted from
cows; but the virtues of these are inferior, &amp;c.
What can be inferred from this variety of evi∣dence
and opinions, unless it be allowed that the
<PB N="438" REF="490"/>
oriental bezoar proceeds not from one species,
but from a number of different animals, and espe∣cially
from the gazelles and goats?</P>
<P>With regard to the occidental bezoars, we he∣sitate
not to pronounce, that they are produced
neither by goats nor gazelles; for it will be shown,
in the subsequent articles, that there are neither
goats, gazelles, nor even any animal which ap∣proaches
to this genus, throughout the whole
extent of the New World. Instead of gazelles,
we find roebucks alone in the woods of Ameri∣ca;
instead of wild goats and sheep, lamas and
pacos<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot"><HI>See vol. V. art.</HI> Of the animals peculiar to the New Con∣tinent.</NOTE>, animals totally different, are to be
found in the mountains of Peru and Chili. The
antient Peruvians had no other cattle; and, at
the same time that these two species were partly
reduced to a domestic state, they existed, in still
greater numbers, in their natural condition of
liberty on the mountains. The wild lamas were
called <HI>huanacus,</HI> and the pacos <HI>vicunnas,</HI> from
which has been derived the name <HI>vigogne,</HI> that
denotes the same animal with the pacos. Both
the lamas and the pacos produce bezoars; but
the domestic kind produce them more rarely than
the wild.</P>
<P>M. Daubenton, who has investigated the na∣ture
of bezoar stones more closely than any other
person, thinks that they are composed of the
same matter as that shining coloured tartar which
<PB N="439" REF="491"/>
adheres to the teeth of ruminating animals;
and it appears, from the numerous collection
of bezoars in the royal cabinet, that there
are essential differences between the oriental
and occidental bezoars. Hence the goats of
the East Indies, and the gazelles of Persia,
are not the only animals which produce the
concretions called <HI>bezoars.</HI> The chamois<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">In the country of the Grisons, balls as large, and some∣times larger, than a tennis-ball, are found in the stomach of the chamois goat. They are called <HI>kemskougnel</HI> by the Ger∣mans, who alledge that they are as useful as the bezoar, which likewise proceeds from the stomachs of certain Indian goats; <HI>Travels to Italy, &amp;c. by Jacob Spon and George Wheeler.</HI>— Near Munich, in a village called <HI>Lagrem,</HI> which is at the foot of the mountains, our host shewed us certain balls or brown masses, nearly of the size of a hen's egg, which were a kind of tender, imperfect bezoar, commonly found in the stomachs of the <HI>roebucks.</HI> He assured us, that these balls had great vir∣tues, and that he often sold them to strangers at ten crowns a piece; <HI>Voyage des Missionaires, tom. 1. p.</HI> 129.</NOTE>,

of Guiney<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">In Congo and Angola, when the wild goats begin to grow old, stones, resembling the bezoar, are found in their bellies.

this name, If we comprehend all similar con∣cretions
found in the intestines of animals, we
may affirm, that most quadrupeds, except those
of the carnivorous kinds, and even the crocodiles
and large serpents, produce bezoars<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">There is another stone, called the <HI>stone of the hooded serpent,</HI> a species of serpent which has a kind of hood hanging behind its head.... and, behind this hood, the stone is found, the smallest being as large as a hen's egg.....

<P><PB N="441" REF="493"/>
To obtain a clear idea of these concretions,
they must be distributed into several classes, re∣ferring
to the animals which produce them, and
the climates and food that are favourable to their
production.</P>
<P>1. The stones formed in the bladder and kid∣neys
of men and other animals must be sepa∣rated
from the class of bezoars, and denominated
by the appellation of <HI>calculi,</HI> their substance be∣ing
totally different from that of the bezoars.
They are easily distinguished by their weight,
their urinous odour, and their structure, which
is neither regular, nor composed of thin con∣centric
circles, like that of the bezoars.</P>
<P>2. The concretions sometimes found in the
gall-bladder and liver of men and animals should
not be regarded as bezoars. They may be di∣stinguished
by their lightness, their colour, and
their inflammability; besides, they are not form∣ed
of concentric circles round a nucleus.</P>
<P>3. The balls frequently found in the stomachs
of animals, and especially of the ruminating kinds,
are not true bezoars. These balls, which are
called <HI>Aegagropili,</HI> are composed, internally, of
hairs swallowed by the animal when licking itself,
or of hard roots which it was unable to digest;
and, externally, most of them are covered with
a viscid substance, which has some resemblance
to bezoar. Hence the <HI>aegagropili</HI> have nothing
in common with the bezoars but this external
<PB N="442" REF="494"/>
covering; and inspection alone is sufficient to
distinguish the one from the other.</P>
<P>4. In temperate climates, we often find <HI>ae∣gagropili</HI>
in animals, but never bezoars. Our
oxen and cows, the Alpine chamois<NOTE N="*" TYPE="foot">See note at p. 439.</NOTE>, and the
Italian porcupine<NOTE N="†" TYPE="foot">We found an aegagropilus in a porcupine sent us from Rome in the year 1763.</NOTE>, produce only <HI>aegagropili.</HI>
The animals of hot countries, on the contrary,
yield only bezoars. The elephant, the rhino∣ceros,
the goats and gazelles of Asia and Africa,
the lama of Peru, &amp;c. instead of <HI>aegagropili,</HI>
produce solid bezoars, whose size and consistence
vary according to the animals and the climates
under which they live.</P>
<P>5. The bezoars, to which so many virtues
have been ascribed, are the oriental kind, and
they are produced by the goats, gazelles, and
sheep, that inhabit the high mountains of Asia.
Bezoars of an inferior quality, which are called
<HI>occidental,</HI> proceed from the lamas and pacas
who are found in the mountains of South Ame∣rica.
In fine, the goats and gazelles of Africa
likewise yield bezoars; but they are not so good
as those of Asia.</P>
<P>From all these facts we may conclude, in ge∣neral,
that the bezoars are only a residue of
vegetable nourishment, which exists not in car∣nivorous
animals, and is peculiar to those who
live upon plants; that, in the southern moun∣tains
of Asia, the herbs being stronger and more

exalted than in any other region of the world,
the bezoars, which are the residue of them, are
also superior in quality to all others; that, in
America, where the heat is less intense, and the
mountain herbs have not so much strength, the
bezoars which proceed from them are also great∣ly
inferior; and, lastly, that, in Europe, where
the herbs are feeble, and in the plains of both
continents, where they are gross, no bezoars are
produced, but only <HI>aegagropili,</HI> which contain
nothing but hairs, roots, or filaments that are
too hard to be digested.</P>
