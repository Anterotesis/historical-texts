<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>COrrupting Votes has so prevail'd this Age,</L>
<L>That Bribery at length has reach'd the Stage;</L>
<L>And I, a Sacrifice, before am sent,</L>
<L>Your Vengeance on the Poet to prevent.</L>
<L>Wit all the Year we give, and hope with Reason</L>
<L>Thin Food may pass in the Repenting Season.</L>
<L>Our Author thence discreetly took the Hint,</L>
<L>And now presents a Play—with nothing in't:</L>
<L>But Trifles still with you have most Success,</L>
<L>And rise in Value as in Emptiness:</L>
<L>That Vndesigning Thing they call a Beau,</L>
<L>The pretty Gentleman of Cringe and Bow;</L>
<L>None e'er believ'd the Ladies strive to win him</L>
<L>For any thing, alas! that is within him.</L>
<L>But here the Scene shou'd all its wants supply,</L>
<L>For Wit is not the growth of <HI>Muscovy:</HI></L>
<L>Tho', faith, of late so flat your Tast is grown,</L>
<L>That <HI>Mosco</HI> may refine upon this Town,</L>
<L>Where the rude Race mind Ornaments nor Fashion;</L>
<L>There's not a powder'd Wig in all the Nation;</L>
<L>No Fop nor Snuff-box there the Fair to move;</L>
<L>Their Women give 'em Ease, but never Love.</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>
Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rude Breast can always be severe,</L>
<L>'Tis known how very civil one was here:</L>
<L>For his Sake then may this be not accurst;</L>
<L>We hope you'll find (if to his Name you're just)</L>
<L>A Second <HI>Czar</HI> obliging as the First.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written <HI>by</HI> Mr. <HI>Burnaby.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>EXpect no fawning, Sirs! the Poet's Champion, I,</L>
<L>Have sworn to stand, and every Judge defie.</L>
<L>But you the bull<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying Criticks I'll not name,</L>
<L>Judges, whose only Business 'tis to damn.</L>
<L>Howe'er we thought you once, the wise and strong;</L>
<L>Know we have born your Impotence too long.</L>
<L>You that above your Sires presume to soar,</L>
<L>And are but Copies daub'd in M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nature;</L>
<L>You that have nothing right in Heart or Tongue,</L>
<L>But only to be resolute in Wrong;</L>
<L>False is your Wit and Judgment. Now I swear</L>
<L>By all the Virgins of each Theatre,</L>
<L>The Poets for the future shall not stand</L>
<L>Like Shrovetide-Cocks, the Pault of every vulgar Hand:</L>
<L>Nor let the purblind Criticks Sentence pass,</L>
<L>That sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts the Beauties through an Optick-glass;</L>
<L>Nor barbarous Noises from the Gallery come,</L>
<L>Nor Mask below to clap, or hiss presume:</L>
<L>Let the Mask cackle at the Fops that flout her,</L>
<L>Or cluck the Squires that hovering peep about her.</L>
<L>—For the great Dons of Wit,</L>
<L>To them is given full Privilege alone</L>
<L>To damn all others, and cry up their own.</L>
<L>The Ladies in their Eyes a killing Pow'r bear,</L>
<L>They can destroy; but nobler 'tis to spare</L>
<L>An humble Victim offer'd to the Fair.</L>

your own, I'll trust my Life with you, by telling you again,
the Emperour, who now Commands the <HI>Russian</HI> Throne, is
an Impostor, and not the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who I saw cover'd

you when call'd, avouch-him for the true <HI>Demetrius?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zuesk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Bosman,</HI> at first I knew him, knew him for
what he is: But was it then a time, when all in one united
Voice saluted him their lawful Emperour, to put in my Dis∣cordiant
Note?</P>
</SP>

<P>I am a Stranger to all that past before Duke <HI>Borris</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zuesk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our good old King, left two Sons, <HI>Theodore</HI> and <HI>De∣metrius,
Theodore</HI> too early paid the debt of Nature; of a Fe∣ver
dy'd; <HI>Demetrius</HI> by his ambitious Uncle fell: Duke <HI>Boris</HI>
destroy'd the growing Vertue of <HI>Demetrius</HI> in the very Bud.
These Barrs remov'd, he soon possest the Crown; <HI>Sophia</HI> he
shut up within a Monastry, where, till this Day, she has re∣main'd
confin'd; but now, as you have seen this Day, re∣ceiv'd
as Mother to this Impostor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That 'tis which Staggers my Belief; sure 'tis impossi∣ble
to counterfeit such Joy, as she appear'd to have at their first
Interview.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Zusk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Interest and her Prudence caus'd it. From whence
this new Impostor comes, Heaven knows. The Vaivode of <HI>Sen∣dimira</HI>
and the <HI>Polish</HI> King have set him up: More I need not
tell you: You see how he prevail'd o're all our Forces; you
saw how <HI>Borris</HI> fell, and then with his victorious Army <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>came
to the Walls of <HI>Mosco,</HI> who open'd wide her Gates to welcom
him; by his Command the Widow and the Sons of <HI>Boris</HI>
were Strangl'd: <HI>Zarriana</HI> too, had met with the same Fate, but
prompt by Jealousie as well as Fears for her dear Life. I secret∣ly
convey'd her to a Monastery; where she remain'd in safety
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
till now, I, unlucky as I am, led her into the very Snare I
had so carefully avoided: But here I swear, by all the Holy
Saints, I will not lose her thus; no, I will tear the Tyrant
from his ill-got Throne; and if no honest Hand and Heart
will help me; I'll boldly do't my self; and claim, as 'tis my
due, the Crown he now Usurps. Shall he who may be from
a Cottage owes his Birth, sway the great Scepter of all our Po∣tent
<HI>Russes;</HI> I am the nearest now in Blood to great <HI>Basivolitz;</HI>
I will not poorly and basely sit still with all my Wrongs; and
yeild a Crown and Mistress to one I know to be a vile Impo∣stor.</P>
</SP>

<P>Alas, my <HI>Bosman;</HI> <HI>I</HI> saw him the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> felt
him cold as Northern Seas; bathed his lifeless Wounds in my
warm Tears; three Nights <HI>I</HI> watch'd him, as loth to part with
the dear breathless Body of my lovely Boy, then see him laid
for ever in his Tomb.</P>

whisper out their Greivances; shaking their Heads, and wish∣ing
old Duke <HI>Boris</HI> were their Czar again; his Tyranny is yet
but in the Bud. When it begins to spread, and shew Matu∣rity,
the Murmurs will rise high, and make them fit for Acti∣on;
and when they want a Head, it will be then a time to
shew our selves; mean time, I will endeavour to know from

descended from an ancient Family of <HI>Geressau,</HI> who
for his voluptuous and vicious Life confin'd him to a Monastery
under my Tuition; where I, unhappy as I was, spurr'd his
Ambition, by often insinuating to him, the Resemblance he
bore to that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who by Duke <HI>Boris</HI> Cruelty was slain.
This in a pregnant working Genius, which he always had,
urg'd him to own himself to be the lawful and only surviving
Heir of <HI>John Basilovitz:</HI> He soon after gain'd admittance into
the Family of the Patriarch, where being for a Fault cha∣stiz'd,
the false <HI>Demetrius</HI> (weeping) told him, <HI>If he knew his
Birth, he wou'd not use him so.</HI> The Patriarch press'd him to
discover who he was. He did, and in such cunning and pa∣thetick
Terms, as he who not suspecting Artifice, believ'd
him: The good Old Man, I say, affected with the Wrongs
he thought was done this false <HI>Demetrius,</HI> promis'd his Prote∣ction,
and gave him Countenance, which soon reach'd to the
Ear of <HI>Boris,</HI> who from the Patriarch then demanded him:
He not having Force sufficient to support his Interest, sent
him to <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> where you my Lord <STAGE>[<HI>To</HI> Manz.]</STAGE> can tell
the Noble Usage which he there did meet, receiv'd by all as

your suffering Vertue, yet may hope Reward; 'tis
<HI>I</HI> am past all hope: Disarm'd and watch'd each Moment, dread∣ing
my approaching Fate, which looks all horrid. Ruine from
the Tyrant's Hand, dismal Ruine and Dishonour. Oh bitter

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mari.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call not that Wrong which is my greatest Happiness;
to dispossess me of the Love of him <HI>I</HI> hate, can be no Injury.
Ten thousand Deaths are not so terrible, as his abhor'd and
Ioath'd Embraces. Pardon me Heav'n; he is indeed my Hus∣band;
but Love, like Empires, are in Fate's disposing. My
Hand I was constrain'd to give; but for my Heart, oh Love,
it was given before; I could most willingly resign my Part of
Empire to you, as the most deserving; but as my Honour is
concern'd, you cannot justly blame me, that I so obstinately
do and will defend it.</P>

<P>Oh name not Empire; when Life's a Load I cannot

Fate has left me. What signifies to Breath a useless Life
away, dispoil'd of all its Joys, and multiply in Sorrows, as in
Years: I will, if possible, provoke his Fury, and make him
kindly cruel: Force him by Scorn and my Upbraidings to
