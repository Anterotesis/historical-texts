<L>And you who fill the blissful seats above!</L>

<L>Who rul'd his subjects with a father's love.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="20"/>Sole in an isle, encircled by the main,</L>
<L>Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign,</L>
<L>Unblest he sighs, detain'd by lawless charms,</L>

<L>The bold <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> there, whose haughty line</L>

The chief shall honour as some heav'nly guest,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="50"/>His vessels loaded with a plenteous store</L>
<L>Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent Ore;</L>
<L>(A richer prize than if his joyful Isle</L>

<L>His friends, his country he shall see, tho' late;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="55"/>Such is our sov'reign Will, and such is Fate.</L>
<L>He spoke. The God who mounts the winged winds</L>
<L>Fast to his feet his golden pinions binds,</L>
<L>That high thro' fields of air his flight sustain</L>
<L>O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="60"/>He grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,</L>
<L>Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye:</L>
<L>Then shoots from heav'n to high <HI>Pieria</HI>'s steep,</L>
<L>And stoops incumbent on the rolling deep.</L>
<L>So wat'ry fowl, that seek their fishy food,</L>

Thus o'er the world of waters <HI>Hermes</HI> flew,</L>
<L>'Till now the distant Island rose in view:</L>
<L>Then swift ascending from the azure wave,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>He took the path that winded to the cave.</L>
<L>Large was the Grot, in which the nymph he found,</L>

<L>She sate and sung; the rocks resound her lays:</L>
<L>The cave was brighten'd with a rising blaze:<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>Cedar and frankincense, an od'rous pile,</L>
<L>Flam'd on the hearth, and wide perfum'd the Isle;</L>
<L>While she with work and song the time divides,</L>

<L>Without the grot, a various sylvan scene<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Appear'd around, and groves of living green;</L>
<L>Poplars and alders ever quiv'ring play'd,</L>
<L>And nodding cypress form'd a fragrant shade;</L>
<L>On whose high branches, waving with the storm,</L>
<L>The birds of broadest wing their mansion form,<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,</L>

<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Depending vines the shelving cavern screen,</L>
<L>With purple clusters blushing thro' the green.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="90"/>Four limpid fountains from the clefts distill,</L>
<L>And ev'ry fountain pours a sev'ral rill,</L>
<L>In mazy windings wand'ring down the hill:</L>
<L>Where bloomy meads with virid greens were crown'd,</L>
<L>And glowing violets threw odors round.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="95"/>A scene, where if a God shou'd cast his sight,</L>
<L>A God might gaze, and wander with delight!</L>
<L>Joy touch'd the Messenger of heav'n: he stay'd</L>
<L>Entranc'd, and all the blissful haunt survey'd.</L>
<L>Him, ent'ring in the cave, <HI>Calypso</HI> knew,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="100"/>For pow'rs celestial to each other's view</L>
<L>Stand still confest, tho' distant far they lie</L>
<L>Or habitants of earth, or sea, or sky.</L>
<L>But sad <HI>Ulysses</HI> by himself apart,</L>
<L>Pour'd the big sorrows of his swelling heart;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="105"/>All on the lonely shore he fate to weep,</L>
<L>And roll'd his eyes around the restless deep;</L>
<L>Tow'rd his lov'd coast he roll'd his eyes in vain,</L>
<L>'Till dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Now graceful seated on her shining throne,</L>
<L>To <HI>Hermes</HI> thus the nymph divine begun.<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>God of the golden wand! on what behest</L>
<L>Arriv'st thou here, an unexpected guest?</L>
<L>Lov'd as thou art, thy free injunctions lay;</L>
<L>'Tis mine, with joy and duty to obey.</L>
<L>'Till now a stranger, in a happy hour<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Approach, and taste the dainties of my bow'r.</L>
<L>Thus having spoke, the nymph the table spread,</L>
<L>(Ambrosial cates, with Nectar rosie red)</L>
<L><HI>Hermes</HI> the hospitable rite partook,</L>
<L>Divine refection! then recruited, spoke.<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>What mov'd this journey from my native sky,</L>
<L>A Goddess asks, nor can a God deny:</L>
<L>Hear then the truth. By mighty <HI>Jove</HI>'s command</L>
<L>Unwilling, have I trod this pleasing land;</L>
<L>For who, self-mov'd, with weary wing wou'd sweep<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>Such length of ocean and unmeasur'd deep?</L>
<L>A world of waters! far from all the ways</L>
<L>Where men frequent, or sacred altars blaze.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
But to <HI>Jove</HI>'s will submission we must pay;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="130"/>What pow'r so great, to dare to disobey?</L>
<L>A man, he says, a man resides with thee,</L>
<L>Of all his kind most worn with misery:</L>
<L>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> (whose arms for nine long years employ'd</L>
<L>Their force on <HI>Ilion,</HI> in the tenth destroy'd)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="135"/>At length embarking in a luckless hour,</L>
<L>With conquest proud, incens'd <HI>Minerva</HI>'s pow'r:</L>
<L>Hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurl'd</L>
<L>With storms pursu'd them thro' the liquid world.</L>
<L>There all his vessels sunk beneath the wave!</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="140"/>There all his dear companions found their grave!</L>
<L>Sav'd from the jaws of death by heav'n's decree,</L>
<L>The tempest drove him to these shores and thee.</L>
<L>Him, <HI>Jove</HI> now orders to his native lands</L>
<L>Strait to dismiss: so Destiny commands:</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="145"/>Impatient Fate his near return attends,</L>
<L>And calls him to his country, and his friends.</L>
<L>Ev'n to her inmost soul the Goddess shook;</L>
<L>Then thus her anguish and her passion broke.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Ungracious Gods! with spite and envy curst!</L>
<L>Still to your own aetherial race the worst!<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Ye envy mortal and immortal joy,</L>
<L>And love, the only sweet of life, destroy.</L>
<L>Did ever Goddess by her charms ingage</L>
<L>A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage?</L>
<L>So when <HI>Aurora</HI> fought <HI>Orion</HI>'s love,<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Her joys disturb'd your blissful hours above,</L>
<L>'Till in <HI>Ortygia, Dian</HI>'s winged dart</L>
<L>Had pierc'd the hapless hunter to the heart.</L>
<L>So when the covert of the thrice-ear'd field</L>
<L>Saw stately <HI>Ceres</HI> to her passion yield,<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>Scarce could <HI>Iäsion</HI> taste her heav'nly charms.</L>
<L>But <HI>Jove</HI>'s swift lightning scorch'd him in her arms.</L>
<L>And is it now my turn, ye mighty pow'rs!</L>
<L>Am I the envy of your blissful bow'rs?</L>
<L>A man, an outcast to the storm and wave,<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>It was my crime to pity, and to save;</L>
<L>When he who thunders rent his bark in twain,</L>
<L>And sunk his brave companions in the main.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
Alone, abandon'd, in mid ocean tost,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="170"/>The sport of winds, and driv'n from ev'ry coast,</L>
<L>Hither this Man of miseries I led,</L>
<L>Received the friendless, and the hungry fed;</L>
<L>Nay promis'd (vainly promis'd!) to bestow</L>
<L>Immortal life, exempt from age and woe.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="175"/>'Tis past—and <HI>Jove</HI> decrees he shall remove;</L>
<L>Gods as we are, we are but slaves to <HI>Jove.</HI></L>
<L>Go then he may (he must, if He ordain)</L>
<L>Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again.</L>
<L>But never, never shall <HI>Calypso</HI> send</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="180"/>To toils like these, her husband, and her friend.</L>
<L>What ships have I, what sailors to convey,</L>
<L>What oars to cut the long laborious way?</L>
<L>Yet, I'll direct the safest means to go:</L>
<L>That last advice is all I can bestow.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="185"/>To her, the Pow'r who bears the charming rod.</L>
<L>Dismiss the Man, nor irritate the God;</L>
<L>Prevent the rage of him who reigns above,</L>
<L>For what so dreadful as the wrath of <HI>Jove?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky,</L>
<L>And in a moment vanish'd from her eye.<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>The Nymph, obedient to divine command,</L>
<L>To seek <HI>Ulysses,</HI> pac'd along the sand.</L>
<L>Him pensive on the lonely beach she found,</L>
<L>With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown'd,</L>
<L>And inly pining for his native shore;<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>For now the soft Enchantress pleas'd no more:</L>
<L>For now, reluctant, and constrain'd by charms,</L>
<L>Absent he lay in her desiring arms,</L>
<L>In slumber wore the heavy night away,</L>
<L>On rocks and shores consum'd the tedious day;<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>There sate all desolate, and sigh'd alone,</L>
<L>With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan,</L>
<L>And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main,</L>
<L>'Till dimm'd with rising grief, they stream'd again.</L>
<L>Here, on his musing mood the Goddess prest,<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>Approaching soft; and thus the chief addrest.</L>
<L>Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey,</L>
<L>No more in sorrows languish life away:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Free as the winds I give thee now to rove—</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="210"/>Go, fell the timber of yon' lofty grove,</L>
<L>And form a Raft, and build the rising ship,</L>
<L>Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep.</L>
<L>To store the vessel let the care be mine,</L>
<L>With water from the rock, and rosie wine,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="215"/>And life-sustaining bread, and fair array,</L>
<L>And prosp'rous gales to waft thee on thy way.</L>
<L>These, if the Gods with my desires comply,</L>
<L>(The Gods alas more mighty far than I,</L>
<L>And better skill'd in dark events to come)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="220"/>In peace shall land thee at thy native home.</L>
<L>With sighs, <HI>Ulysses</HI> heard the words she spoke,</L>
<L>Then thus his melancholy silence broke.</L>
<L>Some other motive, Goddess! sways thy mind,</L>
<L>(Some close design, or turn of woman kind)</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="225"/>Nor my return the end, nor this the way,</L>
<L>On a slight Raft to pass the swelling sea</L>
<L>Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails</L>
<L>The best-built ship, tho' <HI>Jove</HI> inspire the gales.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
The bold proposal how shall I fulfill?</L>
<L>Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will.<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>Swear then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes;</L>
<L>Swear, by the solemn oath that binds the Gods.</L>
<L>Him, while he spoke, with smiles <HI>Calypso</HI> ey'd,</L>
<L>And gently grasp'd his hand, and thus reply'd.</L>
<L>This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought.</L>
<L>How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise?</L>
<L>But hear, oh earth, and hear ye sacred skies!</L>
<L>And thou oh <HI>Styx!</HI> whose formidable floods</L>
<L>Glide thro' the shades, and bind th'attesting Gods!<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>No form'd design, no meditated end</L>
<L>Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend;</L>
<L>Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim;</L>
<L>The same my practice, were my fate the same.</L>
<L>Heav'n has not curst me with a heart of steel,<MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L>But giv'n the sense, to pity, and to feel.</L>
<L>Thus having said, the Goddess march'd before:</L>
<L>He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
At the cool cave arriv'd, they took their state;</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="250"/>He fill'd the throne where <HI>Mercury</HI> had sate.</L>
<L>For him, the Nymph a rich repast ordains,</L>
<L>Such as the mortal life of man sustains:</L>
<L>Before herself were plac'd the cates divine,</L>
<L>Ambrosial banquet, and celestial wine.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="255"/>Their hunger satiate, and their thirst represt,</L>

<L><HI>Ulysses!</HI> (with a sigh she thus began)</L>
<L>Oh sprung from Gods! in wisdom more than man.</L>
<L>Is then thy home the passion of thy heart?</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="260"/>Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part?</L>

<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Am I inferior to a mortal dame?</L>
<L>Less soft my feature, less august my frame?<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>Or shall the daughters of mankind compare</L>

<L>Alas! for this (the prudent man replies)</L>
<L>Against <HI>Ulysses</HI> shall thy anger rise?</L>
<L>Lov'd and ador'd, oh Goddess, as thou art,<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
<L>Forgive the weakness of a human heart.</L>
<L>Tho' well I see thy graces far above</L>
<L>The dear, tho' mortal, object of my love,</L>

<L>And the short date of fading charms below;<MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>Yet ev'ry day, while absent thus I roam,</L>

Thus while he spoke, the beamy Sun descends,</L>

<L>To the close grot the lonely pair remove,</L>
<L>And slept delighted with the gifts of love.</L>
<L>When rosy morning call'd them from their rest,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="295"/>The nymph's fair head a veil transparent grac'd,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="305"/>On the lone Island's utmost verge there stood</L>

(Already dry'd.) These pointing out to view,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="335"/>The nymph dismist him, (od'rous garments giv'n,</L>
<L>And bath'd in fragrant oils that breath'd of heav'n)</L>
<L>Then fill'd two goat-skins with her hands divine,</L>

Swift as a Sea-mew springing from the flood,</L>

<L>Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain,</L>

<L>Observe my orders, and with heed obey,</L>
<L>Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away.<MILESTONE N="445"/></L>
<L>With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows,</L>
<L>Then down the deeps she div'd from whence she rose:</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
A moment snatch'd the shining form away,</L>
<L>And all was cover'd with the curling sea.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="450"/>Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclin'd,</L>
<L>He stands suspended, and explores his mind.</L>
<L>What shall I do? Unhappy me! who knows</L>
<L>But other Gods intend me other woes?</L>
<L>Whoe'er thou art, I shall not blindly join</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="455"/>Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine:</L>

<L>To shield the vessel from the rowling sea;</L>
<L>But cliffs, and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight!<MILESTONE N="520"/></L>
<L>All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white.</L>

'Till the huge surge roll'd off. Then backward sweep</L>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
FIFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_<HI>VLYSSES</HI> makes his first entry in this book.
It may be ask'd where properly is the be∣ginning
of the Action? It is not necessary
that the beginning of the <HI>Action</HI> should be
the beginning of the <HI>Poem;</HI> there is a na∣tural,
and an artificial order, and <HI>Homer</HI>
makes use of the latter. The Action of
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> properly begins neither with
the Poem, nor with the appearance of <HI>Ulysses</HI> here, but with
the relation he makes of his departure from <HI>Troy</HI> in the ninth
book. <HI>Bossu</HI> has very judiciously remark'd, that in the constitu∣tion
of the fable, the Poet ought not to make the Departure of
a Prince from his own country the foundation of his Poem, but
his Return, and his stay in other places involuntary. For if the
stay of <HI>Ulysses</HI> had been voluntary, he would have been guilty in
some degree of all the disorders that happen'd during his absence.
Thus in this book <HI>Ulysses</HI> first appears in a desolate Island, sitting
in tears by the side of the Ocean, and looking upon it as the
obstacle to his return.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40"/>
This artificial order is of great use, it cuts off all languish∣ing
and un-entertaining incidents, and passes over those inter∣vals
of time that are void of action; it gives continuity to
the story, and at first transports the Reader into the middle of the
subject. In the beginning of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> the Gods command
<HI>Mercury</HI> to go down to the Island of <HI>Ogygia,</HI> and charge <HI>Calyp∣so</HI>
to dismiss <HI>Ulysses:</HI> one would think the Poem was to end
in the compass of a few lines, the Poet beginning the action so
near the end of the story; and we wonder how he finds matter
to fill up his Poem, in the little space of time that intervenes be∣tween
his first appearance and his re-establishment.</P>
<P>This book, as well as the first, opens with an Assembly of the
Gods. This is done to give an importance to his Poem, and
to prepare the mind of the Reader to expect every thing that is
great and noble, when Heaven is engag'd in the care and prote∣ction
of his Heroes. Both these Assemblies are placed very pro∣perly,
so as not to interrupt the series of action: The first assem∣bly
of the Gods is only preparatory to introduce the action; and
this second is no more than a bare transition from <HI>Telemachus</HI> to
<HI>Ulysses;</HI> from the recital of the transactions in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to what
more immediately regards the person of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>In the former council, both the Voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> and the
Return of <HI>Ulysses</HI> were determin'd at the same time: The day of
that assembly is the first day both of the <HI>principal action,</HI> (which
is the return of <HI>Ulysses</HI>) and of the <HI>incident,</HI> which is the voyage
of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> with this difference, that the incident was imme∣diately
put in practice, by the descent of <HI>Minerva</HI> to <HI>Ithaca;</HI> and
the execution of it takes up the four preceding books; whereas
the principal action was only then prepared, and the execution
deferr'd to the present book, where <HI>Mercury</HI> is actually sent to

<P>VERSE 43. <HI>Nor help'd by mortal hand, nor guiding Gods.</HI> This
passage is intricate: Why should <HI>Jupiter</HI> command <HI>Ulysses</HI> to re∣turn
without the guidance either of man or God? <HI>Ulysses</HI> had
been just declar'd the care of Heaven, why should he be thus
suddenly abandon'd? <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that it is spoken solely
with respect to the voyage which he immediately undertakes. This
indeed shews a reason why this command is given; if he had
been under the guidance of a God, the shipwreck (that great in∣cident
which brings about the whole Catastrophe of the Poem)
must have been prevented by his power; and as for men, where
were they to be procur'd in a desolate island? What confirms this
opinion is, that during the whole shipwreck of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> there is
no interposition of a Deity, not even of <HI>Pallas</HI> who used to be
his constant guardian; the reason is, because this command of
<HI>Jupiter</HI> forbids all assistance to <HI>Ulysses: Leucothoe</HI> indeed assists
him, but it is not till he is shipwreck'd. It appears further,
that this interdiction respects only the voyage from <HI>Ogygia,</HI> be∣cause
<HI>Jupiter</HI> orders that there shall be no assistance from man,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; but <HI>Ulysses</HI> is transported from
<HI>Phaeacia</HI> to <HI>Ithaca,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or by the assistance of the
<HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes; and therefore what <HI>Jupiter</HI> here
speaks has relation only to the present voyage. <HI>Dacier</HI> understands
this to be meant of any <HI>visible</HI> assistance only: but this seems a
collusion; for whether the Gods assist visibly or invisibly, the
effects are the same; and a Deity unseen might have preserv'd <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
from storms, and directly guided him to his own country.
But it was necessary for the design of <HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should
not sail directly home; if he had, there had been no room for
the relation of his own adventures, and all those surprizing narra∣tions
he makes to the <HI>Phaeacians; Homer</HI> therefore to bring about
the shipwreck of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> withdraws the Gods.</P>

the original is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, is understood:
It signifies, continues he, a small vessel made of one entire piece
of wood, or a vessel about which little wood is used; it is deriv'd
from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from being <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or its be∣ing
compacted together with ease. <HI>Hesychius</HI> defines <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
to be, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: that
is, a small bark, or float of wood which sailors bind together,
and immediately use in navigation. This observation appear'd to
me very necessary, to take off an objection made upon a follow∣ing
passage in this book: the Critics have thought it incredible
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should without any assistance build such a vessel, as
<HI>Homer</HI> describes; but if we remember what kind of a vessel it is, it
may be reconcil'd to probability.</P>

But it may be ask'd in what these people resemble the
Gods? they are describ'd as a most effeminate nation; whence
then this God-like Quality? <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that is either from
their undisturb'd felicity, or from their divine quality of general
benevolence: he prefers the latter; but from the general character
of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> I should prefer the former. <HI>Homer</HI> frequently

bears to the other parts of it? A very essential one: The suffe∣rings
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are the subject of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> here we find him
inclos'd in an Island: all his calamities arise from his absence
from his own country: <HI>Calypso</HI> then who detains him is the
cause of all his calamities. It is with great judgment that the
Poet feigns him to be restrain'd by a Deity, rather than a mortal.
It might have appear'd somewhat derogatory from the prudence
and courage of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> not to have been able by art or strength
to have freed himself from the power of a mortal: but by this
conduct the Poet at once excuses his Heroe, and aggravates his
misfortunes: he is detain'd involuntarily, but it is a Goddess who
detains him, and it is no disgrace for a man not to be able to
over-power a Deity.</P>
<P><HI>Bossu</HI> observes, that the art of Disguise is part of the character
of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> Now this is imply'd in the name of <HI>Calypso,</HI> which
signifies <HI>concealment,</HI> or <HI>secret.</HI> The Poet makes his Heroe stay
seven whole years with this Goddess; she taught him so well, that
he afterwards lost no opportunities of putting her instructions in
practice, and does nothing without disguise.</P>

decency requires the absence of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> if the Poet had describ'd
him in the company of <HI>Calypso,</HI> it might have given suspicion of
an amorous disposition, and he might seem content with his ab∣sence
from his country; but the very nature of the Poem requires
that he should be continually endeavouring to return to it: The
Poet therefore with great judgment describes him agreeably to
his character, his mind is entirely taken up with his misfortunes,
and neglecting all the pleasures which a Goddess could confer,
he entertains himself with his own melancholy reflections, sitting
in solitude upon the sea-shores.</P>

<P><HI>Homer</HI> in this speech of <HI>Calypso</HI> shews very naturally how passion

immortality; and would <HI>Jupiter</HI> thus repay her tenderness to <HI>U∣lysses?</HI>
Would <HI>Jupiter</HI> force him from a place where nothing was
wanting to his happiness, and expose him again to the like dan∣gers
from which she had preserv'd him? this was an act of cru∣elty.
But on the contrary, she speaks not one word concerning
the truth of the cause: <HI>viz.</HI> that she offer'd violence to the incli∣nations
of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> that she made him miserable by detaining him,

<P>But those who have blam'd this passage, form their judgments
from the morality of these ages, and not from the Theology of
the Ancients: Polygamy was then allow'd, and even Concubi∣nage,
without being esteem'd any breach of conjugal fidelity: If
this be not admitted, the heathen Gods are as guilty as the hea∣then
Heroes, and <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> are equally criminals.</P>
<P>This very passage shews the sincere affection which <HI>Ulysses</HI> re∣tain'd
for his wife <HI>Penelope;</HI> even a Goddess cannot persuade him

This seemingly-trifling circumstance is an instance of it;

love delights to oblige, and the least offices receive a value from
the person who performs them: This is the reason why <HI>Calypso</HI>

Indeed <HI>Ulysses</HI> had been no less than seven years in the fa∣vour
of that Goddess; it was a kind of matrimony, and husbands
are not altogether so fond as lovers. But the true reason is, a
more tender behaviour had been contrary to the character of
<HI>Ulysses;</HI> it is necessary that his stay should be by constraint, that
he should continually be endeavouring to return to his own
country; and consequently to have discover'd too great a degree
of satisfaction in any thing during his absence, had outrag'd his
character. His return is the main hinge upon which the whole

chiefly valuable, is the insight it gives us to what degree this art

being left, to the fury and death of <HI>Dido?</HI> Where is there the
whole process of her passion, and all its violent effects to be found,
in the languishing Episode of the <HI>Odysses?</HI>” Much may be said
in vindication of <HI>Homer;</HI> there is a wide difference between the
characters of <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Calypso, Calypso</HI> is a Goddess and conse∣quently
not liable to the same passions, as an enrag'd woman:
yet disappointed love being always an outragious passion, <HI>Homer</HI>
makes her break out into blasphemies against <HI>Jupiter</HI> and all the
Gods. “But the same process of love is not found in <HI>Homer</HI> as in
<HI>Virgil;</HI>” 'Tis true, and <HI>Homer</HI> had been very injudicious if he had
inserted it. The time allows it not; it was necessary for <HI>Homer</HI> to
describe the conclusion of <HI>Calypso</HI>'s passion, not the beginning or
process of it. It was necessary to carry on the main design of
the Poem, <HI>viz.</HI> the Departure of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> in order to his re-esta∣blishment;
and not amuse the Reader with the detail of a passion
that was so far from contributing to the end of the Poem, that
it was the greatest impediment to it. If the Poet had found an
enlargement necessary to his design, had he attempted a full de∣scription
of the passion, and then fail'd, Mr. <HI>Dryden's</HI> Criticism
had been judicious. <HI>Virgil</HI> had a fair opportunity to expatiate, nay
<PB N="53" REF="53"/>
the occasion requir'd it, inasmuch as the love of <HI>Dido</HI> contribu∣ted
to the design of the Poem; it brought about her assistance to
<HI>AEneas,</HI> and the preservation of his companions: and consequent∣ly
the copiousness of <HI>Virgil</HI> is as judicious as the conciseness of
<HI>Homer.</HI> I allow <HI>Virgil</HI>'s to be a masterpiece; perhaps no images
are more happily drawn in all that Poet; but the passages in the
two Authors are not similar, and consequently admit of no com∣parison:
Would it not have been insufferable in <HI>Homer,</HI> to have
stepp'd seven years backward, to describe the process of <HI>Calypso</HI>'s
passion, when the very nature of the Poem requires that <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
should immediately return to his own country? ought
the action to be suspended for a fine description? But an op∣posite
conduct was judicious in both the Poets, and therefore <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>
is commendable for giving us the whole process of a love∣passion
in <HI>Dido, Homer</HI> for only relating the conclusion of it in
<HI>Calypso.</HI> I will only add that <HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd his Machinery
from <HI>Homer,</HI> and that the departure of <HI>AEneas</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> is
brought about by the command of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the descent of
<HI>Mercury.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 344.—Ulysses <HI>spreads his sails.</HI>] It is observable
that the Poet passes over the parting of <HI>Calypso</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> in si∣lence;
he leaves it to be imagin'd by the Reader, and prosecutes
his main action. Nothing but a cold compliment could have pro∣ceeded
from <HI>Ulysses,</HI> he being overjoy'd at the prospect of return∣ing
to his country: it was therefore judicious in <HI>Homer</HI> to omit
the relation; and not draw <HI>Calypso</HI> in tears, and <HI>Ulysses</HI> in a trans∣port
of joy. Besides, it was necessary to shorten the Episode: the
commands of <HI>Jupiter</HI> were immediately to be obey'd; and the
story being now turn'd to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> it was requisite to put him im∣mediately
upon action, and describe him endeavouring to re-esta∣blish
his own affairs, which is the whole design of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

may seem incredible that one person should be able to manage a
vessel seventeen days without any assistance; but <HI>Eustathius</HI> vin∣dicates
<HI>Homer</HI> by an instance, that very much resembles this of
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> A certain <HI>Pamphylian</HI> being taken prisoner, and carried to
<HI>Tamiathis</HI> (afterwards <HI>Damietta</HI>) in <HI>AEgypt,</HI> continued there seve∣ral
years; but being continually desirous to return to his country,
he pretends a skill in sea affairs; this succeeds, and he is imme∣diately
employ'd in Maritime business, and permitted the liberty
to follow it according to his own inclination, without any inspe∣ction.
He made use of this opportunity, and furnishing himself
with a sail, and provisions for a long voyage, committed himself
to the sea all alone; he cross'd that vast extent of waters that lies
between <HI>AEgypt</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> and arriv'd safely in his own coun∣try:
In memory of this prodigious event he chang'd his name,

<P>It may not be improper to observe, that this description of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
sailing alone is a demonstration of the smallness of his ves∣sel;
for it is impossible that a large one could be managed by a
single person. It is indeed said that twenty trees were taken down
for the vessel, but this does not imply that all the trees were
made use of, but only so much of them as was necessary to his

the expression of <HI>Neptune</HI>'s seeing <HI>Ulysses</HI> from the mountains of
<HI>Solymé,</HI> is to be taken in a general sense, and not to denote the
<HI>Solymaean</HI> mountains in <HI>Pisidia;</HI> but other eastern mountains that
bear the same appellation. In propriety, the <HI>Solymaeans</HI> inhabit the
summits of mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> from <HI>Lycia</HI> even to <HI>Pisidia;</HI> these were
very distant from the passage of <HI>Neptune</HI> from the <HI>AEthiopians,</HI>
and consequently could not be the mountains intended by <HI>Ho∣mer;</HI>
we must therefore have recourse to the preceding assertion
of <HI>Strabo,</HI> for a solution of the difficulty. <HI>Dacier</HI> endeavours to
explain it another way: Who knows, says she, but that the name
of <HI>Solymaean</HI> was antiently extended to all very elevated moun∣tains?
<HI>Bochart</HI> affirms, that the word <HI>Solymi</HI> is deriv'd from the
<HI>Hebrew Selem,</HI> or <HI>Darkness;</HI> why then might not this be a gene∣ral
appellation? But this is all conjecture, and it is much more
probable that such a name should be given to some mountains by
way of distinction and emphatically, from some peculiar and ex∣traordinary
quality; than extend it to all very losty mountains,
which could only introduce confusion and error.</P>

The storm, and the behaviour of <HI>AEneas,</HI> are copy'd exactly from it.
The storm, in both the Poets, is describ'd concisely, but the
images are full of terror; <HI>Homer</HI> leads the way, and <HI>Virgil</HI> treads
in his steps without any deviation. <HI>Ulysses</HI> falls into lamentation,
so does <HI>AEneas: Ulysses</HI> wishes he had found a nobler death, so
does <HI>AEneas:</HI> this discovers a bravery of spirit, they lament not
that they are to die, but only the inglorious manner of it. This
fully answers an objection that has been, made both against
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> who have been blam'd for describing their He∣roes
with such an air of mean-spiritedness. Drowning was e∣steem'd

<P>It is not probable that <HI>Ulysses</HI> could escape so great a danger by
his own strength alone; and therefore the Poet introduces <HI>Leu∣cothea</HI>
to assist in his preservation. But it may be ask'd, if this is
not contradictory to the command of <HI>Jupiter</HI> in the beginning
of this book? <HI>Ulysses</HI> is there forbid all assistance either from men
or Gods; whence then is it that <HI>Leucothea</HI> preserves him? The
former passage is to be understood to imply an interdiction only
of all assistance 'till <HI>Ulysses</HI> was shipwreck'd; he was to suffer,
not to die: Thus <HI>Pallas</HI> afterwards calms the storm; she may be
imagin'd to have a power over the winds, as she is the daughter
of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who denotes the Air, according to the observation of
<HI>Eustathius:</HI> Here <HI>Leucothea</HI> is very properly introduced to pre∣serve

<P>VERSE 440. <HI>This heav'nly Scarf beneath thy bosom bind.</HI>] This
passage may seem extraordinary, and the Poet be thought to pre∣serve
<HI>Ulysses</HI> by incredible means. What virtue could there be
in this Scarf against the violence of storms? <HI>Eustathius</HI> very well
answers this objection. It is evident that the belief of the power
of Amulets or Charms prevailed in the times of <HI>Homer;</HI> thus <HI>Moly</HI>
is used by <HI>Ulysses</HI> as a preservative against Fascination, and some
charm may be supposed to be imply'd in the <HI>Zone</HI> or <HI>Caestus</HI> of
<HI>Venus.</HI> Thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> may be imagin'd to have worn a scarf, or cin∣cture,
as a preservative against the perils of the sea. They conse∣crated
antiently <HI>Votiva,</HI> as tablets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the temples of their
Gods: So <HI>Ulysses,</HI> wearing a Zone consecrated to <HI>Leucothea,</HI> may
be said to receive it from the hands of that Goddess. <HI>Eustathius</HI>
observes, that <HI>Leucothea</HI> did not appear in the form of a Bird, for
<PB N="58" REF="58"/>
then how should she speak, or how bring this cincture or
scarf? The expression has relation only to the manner of her
rising out of the sea, and descending into it; the Action, not
the Person, is intended to be represented. Thus <HI>Minerva</HI> is said
in the <HI>Odyssey, to fly away,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not in the <HI>form</HI>
but with the <HI>swiftness</HI> of an Eagle. Most of the Translators have

himself to the seas? <HI>Leucothea</HI> does not confine <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
to an immediate compliance with her injunctions; she in∣deed
commands him to forsake the Raft, but leaves the Time
to his own discretion: And <HI>Ulysses</HI> might very justly be some∣what
incredulous, when he knew that <HI>Neptune</HI> was his ene∣my,

are the doubts of a wise man: But then, is not <HI>Ulysses</HI> de∣scrib'd
with a greater degree of prudence, than the Goddess? she
commands him to leave the Raft, he chuses to make use of it
'till he arrives nearer the shores. <HI>Eustathius</HI> directly ascribes more
wisdom to <HI>Ulysses</HI> than to <HI>Leucothea.</HI> This may appear too partial;

he rises or falls as his subject leads him, and finds allusions proper

here an instance of it; he compares <HI>Ulysses</HI> to a <HI>Polypus;</HI> the si∣militude
is suited to the element, and to the condition of the
person. It is observable, that this is the only full description of
a person shipwreck'd in all his Poems: he therefore gives a loose
to his imagination, and enlarges upon it very copiously. There
appears a surprizing fertility of invention thro' the whole of it:
In what a variety of attitudes is <HI>Ulysses</HI> drawn, during the storm
and at his escape from it? his soliloquies in the turns of his condi∣tion,
while he is sometimes almost out of danger, and then a∣gain
involv'd in new difficulties, engage our hopes and fears. He
ennobles the whole by his machinery, and <HI>Neptune, Pallas</HI> and
<HI>Leucothea</HI> interest themselves in his safety or destruction. He has
likewise chosen the most proper occasion for a copious descripti∣on;
there is leisure for it. The proposition of the Poem requires
him to describe a man of sufferings in the person of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> he
therefore no sooner introduces him, but he throws him into the utmost
calamities, and describes them largely, to shew at once the greatness
of his distress, and his wisdom and patience under it. In what are the
sufferings of <HI>Aeneas</HI> in <HI>Virgil</HI> comparable to these of <HI>Ulysses? Ae∣neas</HI>

<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 12. Where never science rear'd her lawrel'd head.]</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Phaeacians</HI> having a great share in the
succeeding parts of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> it may not
be improper to enlarge upon their chara∣cter.
<HI>Homer</HI> has here describ'd them very
distinctly: he is to make use of the <HI>Phae∣acians</HI>
to convey <HI>Ulysses</HI> to his country,
he therefore by this short character, gives the
Reader such an Image of them, that he
is not surpriz'd at their credulity and simplicity, in believ∣ing
all those fabulous recitals which <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes in the pro∣gress
of the Poem. The place likewise in which he describes
them is well chosen; it is before they enter upon Action,
and by this method we know what to expect from them,
and see how every action is naturally suited to their character.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="89"/>
<HI>Bossu</HI> observes that the Poet has inserted this verse with great
judgment: <HI>Ulysses,</HI> says he, knew that the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were simple
and credulous; and that they had all the qualities of a lazy peo∣ple,
who admire nothing so much as romantic adventures: he
therefore pleases them, by recitals suited to their own humour:
But even here the Poet is not unmindful of his more understand∣ing
Readers, and the truth intended to be taught by way of
moral is, that a soft and effeminate life breaks the spirit, and ren∣ders
it incapable of manly sentiments or actions.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> seems to understand this verse in a different manner;
he quotes it in his dissertation upon Banishment, to shew that <HI>Nau∣sithous</HI>
made his people happy tho' he left his own country, and
settled them far from the commerce of mankind, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
without any particular view to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> which
was undoubtedly intended by <HI>Homer;</HI> those words being a kind
of a Preface to their general character.</P>
<P>This <HI>Phaeacia</HI> of the ancients is the Island now called <HI>Cor∣fu.</HI>
The Inhabitants of it were a Colony of the <HI>Hyperians:
Eustathius</HI> remarks, that it has been a question whether <HI>Hy∣peria</HI>
were a City or an Island; he judges it to be a Ci∣ty:
it was infested by the <HI>Cyclops;</HI> but they had no shipping, as
appears from the 10th of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and consequently if it had
been an Island, they could not have molested the <HI>Phaeacians;</HI> he
therefore concludes it to be a City, afterwards call'd <HI>Camarina</HI> in
<HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Barnes</HI> has here added a verse that is not to be found in
any other edition; and I have render'd it in the translation:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 24. <HI>Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace.</HI>]
The Poet, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, celebrates the beauty of these
two attending Virgins to raise their characters, that they may not be
esteem'd common servants, or the Poet thought extravagant when
he compares <HI>Nausicaa</HI> and her damsels to <HI>Diana</HI> and her nymphs.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="90"/>
The judgment with which he introduces the vision is remarkable:
In the <HI>Iliad,</HI> when he is to give an air of importance to his vision,
he cloathes it in the likeness of <HI>Nestor,</HI> the wisest person of the Ar∣my;
a man of less consideration had been unsuitable to the great∣ness
of the occasion, which was to persuade Kings and Heroes.
Here the Poet sends a vision to a young Lady, under the resemblance
of a young Lady: he adapts the circumstances to the person, and
describes the whole with an agreeable propriety. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 31. The spousal ornament neglected lies;</L>
<L>Arise, prepare the bridal train.]</L></Q>
<P>Here is a remarkable custom of Antiquity. <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes,
that it was usual for the bride to give changes of dress to the
friends of the bridegroom at the celebration of the marriage, and
<HI>Homer</HI> directly affirms it. <HI>Dacier</HI> quotes a passage in <HI>Judges</HI> con∣cerning
<HI>Sampson</HI>'s giving changes of garments at his marriage feast,
as an instance of the like custom amongst the <HI>Israelites;</HI> but I
believe, if there was such a custom at all amongst them, it is not
evident from the passage alledg'd: Nothing is plainer than that
<HI>Sampson</HI> had not given the garments, if his riddle had not been
expounded: nay, instead of giving, he himself had receiv'd them,
if it had not been interpreted. I am rather of opinion that what is
said of <HI>Sampson,</HI> has relation to another custom amongst the Ancients,
of proposing an <HI>Aenigma</HI> at festivals, and adjudging a reward to him
that solv'd it. These the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>gri∣phos
convivales; Athenaeus</HI> has a long dissertation about this pra∣ctise
in his 10th book, and gives a number of instances of the
Aenigmatical propositions in use at <HI>Athens,</HI> and of the forfeitures
and rewards upon the solution, and non-solution of them; and
<HI>Eustathius</HI> in the 10th book of the <HI>Odyssey</HI> comes into the same,
opinion. So that if it was a custom amongst the <HI>Israelites</HI> as
well as <HI>Greeks</HI> to give garments, (as it appears to be to give
other gifts) this passage is no instance of it: It is indeed a proof
<PB N="94" REF="91"/>
that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> as well as <HI>Greeks</HI> had a custom of entertain∣ing
themselves at their festivals, with these <HI>griphi convivales:</HI> I
therefore believe that these changes of garments, were no more
than rewards or forfeits, according to the success in the inter∣pretation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 33. <HI>A just applause the cares of dress impart.</HI>] It is
very probable that <HI>Quintilian</HI> had this verse in his view when he
wrote <HI>Cultus magnificus addit hominibus, ut Graeco versu testatum est,

<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<P>What I would chiefly observe is the propriety with which this
commendation of dress is introduc'd; it is put into the mouth
of a young Lady (for so <HI>Pallas</HI> appears to be) to whose character
it is suitable to delight in Ornament. It likewise agrees very well
with the description of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> whose chief happiness con∣sisted
in dancing, dressing, singing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a commenda∣tion
of ornament would have been improper in the mouth of a
Philosopher, but beautiful when spoken by a young Lady to
<HI>Alcinous.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 35. <HI>Haste to the limpid stream.</HI>] This passage has
not escap'd the raillery of the Critics; <HI>Homer,</HI> say they, brings
the Goddess of Wisdom down from heaven, only to advise <HI>Nau∣sicaa</HI>
to make haste to wash her cloaths against her wedding: what
necessity is there for a conduct so extraordinary upon so trivial
an occasion? <HI>Eustathius</HI> sufficiently answers the objection, by ob∣serving
that the Poet very naturally brings about the safety of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="92"/>
by it; the action of the washing is the means, the prote∣ction
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> the end of the descent of that Goddess; so that
she is not introduced lightly, or without contributing to an im∣portant
action: And it must be allow'd that the means made use
of are very natural; they grow out of the occasion, and at once
give the fable a poetical turn, and an air of probability.</P>
<P>It has been further objected, that the Poet gives an unwor∣thy
employment to <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> the daughter of a King; but such
Critics form their idea of ancient, from modern greatness: It wou'd
be now a meaness to describe a person of Quality thus employ'd,
because custom has made it the work of persons of low conditi∣on:
It would be now thought dishonourable for a Lady of bright
station to attend the flocks; yet we find in the most ancient hi∣story
extant, that the daughters of <HI>Laban</HI> and <HI>Jethro,</HI> persons of
power and distinction, were so employ'd, without any dishonour
to their quality. In short, these passages are to be look'd upon
as exact pictures of the old World, and consequently as valua∣ble
remains of Antiquity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 41. <HI>The royal car obtain.</HI>] It would have been an
impropriety to have render'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> by the word chariot;
<HI>Homer</HI> seems industriously to avoid <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but constantly uses
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; this car was drawn by mules; whereas, ob∣serves
<HI>Eustathius,</HI> the chariot or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was proper only for horses.
The word Car takes in the Idea of any other vehicle, as well as
of a Chariot.</P>
<P>This passage has undergone a very severe censure, as mean
and ridiculous, chiefly from the expressions to her father after∣wards,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: which being render'd, <HI>high, and round,</HI>
disgrace the Author: No person, I believe, would ask a father
to lend his high and round Car; nor has <HI>Homer</HI> said it: <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>
observes, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is the same as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
or wheels; and that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<PB N="96" REF="93"/>
or the quadrangular body
of the Car that rests upon the axle of it; this fully answers the
Criticism: <HI>Nausicaa</HI> describes the Car so particularly, to distin∣guish
it from a Chariot, which had been improper for her pur∣pose:
The other part of the objection, concerning the roundness
of the Car, is a mistake in the Critic; the word having relation
to the wheels, and not to the body of it, which, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> ob∣serves,
was quadrangular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 47. <HI>Then to the Palaces of heav'n she sails.] Lucre∣tius</HI>

<P>The picture is the same in both Authors, but the colour∣ing
in my opinion is less beautiful in <HI>Homer</HI> than <HI>Lucretius:</HI>
the three last lines in particular are fuller of ornament, and the

<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 88. <HI>Tunicks, and stoles, and robes imperial bears.</HI> It is
not without reason that the Poet describes <HI>Nausicaa</HI> carrying the
whole wardrobe of the family to the river: he inserts these
circumstances so particularly, that she may be able to cloath
<HI>Ulysses</HI> in the sequel of the story: he further observes the
modesty and simplicity of these early times, when the whole
dress of a King and his family (who reign'd over a people
that delighted in dress) is without gold: for we see <HI>Nausi∣caa</HI>
carries with her all the habits that were used at the great∣est
solemnities; which had they been wrought with gold could
not have been washed. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 95. <HI>Now mounting the gay seat,</HI> &amp;c.] This Image
of <HI>Nausicaa</HI> riding in her Car to the river, has exercis'd the pen∣cils
of excellent Painters. <HI>Pausanias</HI> in his fifth book, which
is the first of the <HI>Eliacs,</HI> speaks of a picture of two Virgins drawn
by Mules, of which the one guides the reins, the other has her
head cover'd with a veil: It is believ'd that it represents <HI>Nausi∣caa,</HI>
the daughter of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> going with one of her virgins to
the river. The words of <HI>Pausanias</HI> have caused some doubt
with relation to the picture; he says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>up∣on
Mules,</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> describes her upon a Car; how then
can <HI>Nausicaa</HI> be intended by the Painter? But <HI>Romulus Amasaeus,</HI>
who comments upon <HI>Pausanias,</HI> solves the difficulty, by observing
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does not signify upon Mules, but a Car drawn
by Mules, by a figure frequent in all Authors. <HI>Pliny</HI> is also
thus to be understood in his 35th book; <HI>Protogenes</HI> the <HI>Rhodian</HI>
painted at <HI>Athens Paralus,</HI> and likewise <HI>Hemionida,</HI> who is said
<PB N="98" REF="95"/>
to represent <HI>Nausicaa; Hemionida</HI> is used (as <HI>Hermolaus Barbarus</HI>

<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 101. Where gathering into depth from falling rills,</L>
<L>The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.]</L></Q>
<P>It is evident, that the Ancients had basons, or cisterns, continu∣ally
supply'd by the rivers for this business of washing; they were
call'd, observes <HI>Eustathius,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and were sometimes
made of marble, other times of wood. Thus in the <HI>Iliad,</HI>
book 22,
<Q><L>Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,</L>
<L>Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills,</L>
<L><HI>Where</HI> Trojan <HI>dames ere yet alarm'd by</HI> Greece,</L>
<L>Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.</L></Q>
The manner of washing was different from what is now in use:
They trod them with their feet, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Eu∣stathius.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought that these customs are of small importance,
and of little concern to the present ages: It is true; but
Time has stamp'd a value upon them: like ancient Medals,
their intrinsic worth may be small, but yet they are valuable,
because images of Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Symposiacs</HI> proposes this question, Why <HI>Nausi∣caa</HI>
washes in the river, rather than the sea, tho' it was more
nigh, more hot, and consequently more fit for the purpose
than the river? <HI>Theon</HI> answers from <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that the sea-water
has many gross, rough, and earthy particles in it, as appears from
its saltness, whereas fresh water is more pure and unmixt, and
consequently more subtle and penetrating, and fitter for use in
<PB N="99" REF="96"/>
washing. <HI>Themistocles</HI> dislikes this reason, and affirms that sea-water
being more rough and earthy, than that of rivers, is there∣fore
the most proper, for its cleansing quality; this appears from
observation, for in washing, ashes or some such substance are
thrown into the fresh water to make it effectual, for those par∣ticles
open the pores, and conduce to the effect of cleansing.
The true reason then is, that there is an unctuous nature in sea-water,
(and <HI>Aristotle</HI> confesses all salt to be unctuous) which hin∣ders
it from cleansing: whereas river-water is pure, less mixt, and
consequently more subtle and penetrating, and being free from all
oily substance, is preferable and more effectual than sea-water.</P>

<P>VERSE 117. <HI>As when o'er</HI> Erymanth Diana <HI>roves.</HI>] This
is a very beautiful comparison, (and when-ever I say any thing
in commendation of <HI>Homer,</HI> I would always be understood to
mean the original.) <HI>Virgil</HI> was sensible of it, and inserted it in his
Poem,
<Q><L>Qualis in Eurotae ripis aut per juga Cynthi</L>

<L>Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades: illa pharetram</L>
<L>Fert humero, gradiensque dea supereminet omnes:</L>
<L>Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus.</L></Q>
It has given occasion for various Criticisms, with relation to the
beauty of the two Authors. I will lay before the Reader what
is said in behalf of <HI>Homer</HI> in <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> and the answer by
<HI>Scaliger.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gellius</HI> writes, that it was the opinion of <HI>Valerius Probus,</HI> that
no passage has been more unhappily copy'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> than this
comparison. <HI>Homer</HI> very beautifully compares <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> a Virgin,
sporting with her damsels in a solitary place, to <HI>Diana,</HI> a virgin
Goddess, taking her diversion in a forest, in hunting with her ru∣ral
<PB N="100" REF="97"/>
Nymphs. Whereas <HI>Dido,</HI> a widow, is drawn by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the
midst of a city, walking gravely with the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Princes, <HI>Instans
operi, regnisque futuris,</HI> a circumstance that bears not the least re∣semblance
to the sports of the Goddess. <HI>Homer</HI> represents <HI>Diana</HI>
with her quiver at her shoulder, but at the same time he describes
her as an huntress: <HI>Virgil</HI> gives her a quiver, but mentions no∣thing
of her as an huntress, and consequently lays a needless bur∣then
upon her shoulder. <HI>Homer</HI> excellently paints the fulness
of joy which <HI>Latona</HI> felt at the sight of her daughter, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
<HI>Virgil</HI> falls infinitely short of it in the word
<HI>pertentant,</HI> which signifies a light joy that sinks not deep into the
heart. Lastly <HI>Virgil</HI> has omitted the strongest point and very
flower of the comparison,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
'Tis the last circumstance that compleats the comparison, as it
distinguishes <HI>Nausicaa</HI> from her attendants, for which very pur∣pose
the allusion was introduced.</P>
<P><HI>Scaliger</HI> (who never deserts <HI>Virgil</HI> in any difficulty) answers, that
the persons, not the places, are intended to be represented by both
Poets; otherwise <HI>Homer</HI> himself is blameable, for <HI>Nausicaa</HI> is not
sporting on a mountain but a plain, and has neither bow nor
quiver like <HI>Diana.</HI> Neither is there any weight in the objection
concerning the gravity of the gait of <HI>Dido;</HI> for neither is <HI>Nausicaa</HI>
describ'd in the act of hunting, but dancing: And as for the word
<HI>pertentant,</HI> it is a Metaphor taken from musicians and musical
instruments: it denotes a strong degree of joy, <HI>per</HI> bears an inten∣sive
sense, and takes in the perfection of joy. As to the qui∣ver,
it was an ensign of the Goddess, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was of
<HI>Apollo,</HI> and is apply'd to her upon all occasions indifferently, not
only by <HI>Virgil,</HI> but more frequently by <HI>Homer.</HI> Lastly, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is superfluous, for the joy of <HI>Latona</HI> compleats
the whole, and <HI>Homer</HI> has already said <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="98"/>
But still it must be allow'd, that there is a greater correspon∣dence
to the subject intended to be illustrated, in <HI>Homer</HI> than in
<HI>Virgil. Diana</HI> sports, so does <HI>Nausicaa; Diana</HI> is a Virgin, so is
<HI>Nausicaa; Diana</HI> is amongst her virgin Nymphs, <HI>Nausicaa</HI> among
her virgin attendants: whereas in all these points there is the
greatest dissimilitude between <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Diana:</HI> And no one I be∣lieve
but <HI>Scaliger</HI> can think the verse above quoted superfluous,
which indeed is the beauty and perfection of comparison. There
may, perhaps, be a more rational objection made against this line
in both Poets.</P>
<Q>Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus.</Q>
<P>This verse has no relation to the principal subject, the expectati∣on
is fully satisfy'd without it, and it alludes to nothing that ei∣ther
precedes or follows it, and consequently may be judg'd su∣perfluous.</P>

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Suidas</HI> countenances the alteration, for he writes
that a damsel named <HI>Larissa,</HI> as she sported at this play, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) was drowned in the river <HI>Peneus. Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>What I would further observe is, the art of the Poet in car∣rying
on the story: He proceeds from incident to incident very
naturally, and makes the sports of these Virgins contribute to the
principal design of the Poem, and promote the re-establishment
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> by discovering him advantagiously to the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI>
He so judiciously interweaves these sports into the texture of the
story, that there would be a chasm if they were taken away; and
the sports of the Virgins are as much of a piece with the whole,
as any of the labours of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet reaps a further advantage from this conduct: it beau∣tifies
and enlivens the Poem with a pleasant and entertaining
scene, and relieves the Reader's mind by taking it off from a
continual representation of horrour and sufferings in the story of
<HI>Ulysses:</HI> He himself seems here to take breath, and indulging
his fancy, lets it run out into several beautiful comparisons,
to prepare the Reader to hear with a better relish the long detail
of the calamities of his Heroe, thro' the sequel of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 151. Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads</L>
<L>A wreathy foliage and concealing shades.]</L></Q>
<P>This passage has given great offence to the Critics. The interview
between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> says <HI>Rapine,</HI> outrages all the rules
of decency: She forgets her modesty, and betrays her virtue, by
giving too long an audience: she yields too much to his com∣plaints,
and indulges her curiosity too far at the sight of a person
in such circumstances. But perhaps <HI>Rapine</HI> is too severe; <HI>Homer</HI>
has guarded every circumstance with as much caution as if he
had been aware of the objection: He covers his loins with a
broad foliage, (for <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or <HI>a broad branch</HI>) he makes <HI>Ulysses</HI> speak at a pro∣per
distance, and introduces <HI>Minerva</HI> to encourage her virgin
modesty. Is there here any outrage of decency? Besides, what
takes off this objection of immodesty in <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> is, that
the sight of a naked man was not unusual in those ages; it
was customary for Virgins of the highest quality to attend He∣roes
to the bath, and even to assist in bathing them, without any
breach of modesty; as is evident from the conduct of <HI>Po∣lycaste</HI>
in the conclusion of the third book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> who
bathes and perfumes <HI>Telemachus.</HI> If this be true, the other
<PB N="104" REF="101"/>
objections of <HI>Rapine</HI> about her yielding too much to his com∣plaints,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of no weight; but so many testimonies of
her virtuous and compassionate disposition, which induces
her to pity and relieve calamity. Yet it may seem that the
other damsels had a different opinion of this interview, and
that thro' modesty they ran away, while <HI>Nausicaa</HI> alone talks
with <HI>Ulysses:</HI> But this only shews, not that she had less modesty,
but more prudence, than her retinue; the damsels fled not out
of modesty, but fear of an enemy: whereas <HI>Nausicaa</HI> wisely re∣flects
that no such person could arrive there, the country being
an Island; and from his appearance, she rightly concluded him
to be a man in calamity. This Wisdom is the <HI>Pallas</HI> in the Al∣legory,
which makes her to stay when the other damsels fly for
want of equal reflection. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> cover'd themselves
after the same manner as <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 153. <HI>As when a Lion in the midnight hours.]</HI> This
is a very noble comparison, yet has not escap'd censure; it has
been objected that it is improper for the occasion, as bearing
images of too much terror, only to fright a few timorous Vir∣gins,
and that the Poet is unseasonably sublime. This is only
true in Burlesque poetry, where the most noble images are fre∣quently
assembled to disgrace the subject, and to shew <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ridicu∣lous
disproportion between the allusion and the principal sub∣ject;
but the same reason will not hold in Epic Poetry, where
the Poet raises a low circumstance into dignity by a sublime
comparison. The simile is not introduced merely to shew the
impression it made upon the Virgins, but paints <HI>Ulysses</HI> him∣self
in very strong colours: <HI>Ulysses</HI> is fatigued with the tem∣pests
and waves; the Lion with winds and storms: it is hung∣er
that drives the Lion upon his prey; an equal necessity
compells <HI>Ulysses</HI> to go down to the Virgins: the Lion is de∣scribed
<PB N="105" REF="102"/>

<L>This man my spouse, or such a spouse as he!]</L></Q>
<P>This passage has been censur'd as an outrage against Modesty and
Credibility; Is it probable that a young Princess should fall in
<PB N="114" REF="111"/>
love with a stranger at the first sight? and if she really falls in love,
is it not an indecent passion? I will lay before the Reader the
observations of <HI>Plutarch</HI> upon it. “If <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> upon casting
her eyes upon this stranger, and feeling such a passion for him
as <HI>Calypso</HI> felt, talks thus out of wantonness, her conduct is
blameable; but if perceiving his wisdom by his prudent ad∣dress,
she wishes for such an husband, rather than a person of
her own country, who had no better qualifications than sing∣ing,
dancing and dressing; she is to be commended.” This
discovers no weakness but prudence, and a true judgment. She
deserves to be imitated by the fair sex, who ought to prefer a
good understanding, before a fine coat, and a man of worth, be∣fore
a good dancer.</P>
<P>Besides, it may be offer'd in vindication of <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> that she
had in the morning been assured by a vision from Heaven, that
her nuptials were at hand; this might induce her to believe that
<HI>Ulysses</HI> was the person intended by the vision for her husband;
and his good sense and prudent behaviour, as <HI>Dacier</HI> observes,
might make her wish it, without any imputation of immodesty.</P>

The Island of <HI>Phaeacia</HI> has two

<P>VERSE 325. <HI>They rush into the deep with eager joy.]</HI> It is ve∣ry
judicious in the Poet to let us thus fully into the character of
the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> before he comes to show what relation they have
to the story of the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> He describes <HI>Alcinous</HI> and the peo∣ple
of better rank, as persons of great hospitality and humanity,
this gives an air of probability to the free and benevolent recep∣tion
which <HI>Ulysses</HI> found: He describes the vulgar as excellent
navigators; and he does this not only because they are Islanders;
but, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, to prepare the way for the return of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> who was to be restored by their conduct to his country,
even against the inclination of <HI>Neptune,</HI> the God of the Ocean.
But it may be ask'd, is not <HI>Homer</HI> inconsistent with himself, when
he paints the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> as men of the utmost humanity, and im∣mediately
after calls them a proud unpolish'd race; and given up
to censoriousness? It is easy to reconcile the seeming contradi∣ction,
by applying the character of humanity to the higher rank
of the nation, and the other to the vulgar and the mariners. I
believe the same character holds good to this day amongst any
people, who are much addicted to sea-affairs; they contract
a roughness, by being secluded from the more general con∣verse
of mankind, and consequently are strangers to that affabi∣lity
which is the effect of a more enlarg'd conversation.
But what is it that inclines the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> to be censorious? It is
to be remember'd, that they are every where describ'd as a people
abandon'd to idleness; To idleness therefore that part of their cha∣racter
is to be imputed. When the thoughts are not employed
upon <HI>things,</HI> it is usual to turn them upon <HI>persons:</HI> A good man
has not the inclination, an industrious man not the leisure, to be
censorious, so that censure is the property of idleness. This I take
to be the moral, intended to be drawn from the character of the
<HI>Phaeacians.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 331. <HI>What stranger this, whom thus</HI> Nausicaa <HI>leads?]</HI>
This is an instance of the great art of <HI>Homer,</HI> in saying every
thing properly. <HI>Nausicaa</HI> had conceiv'd a great esteem for <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
and she had an inclination to let him know it; but mode∣sty
forbad her to reveal it openly: How then shall <HI>Ulysses</HI> know
the value she has for his person, consistently with the modesty of
<HI>Nausicaa? Homer</HI> with great address puts her compliments into
the mouth of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and by this method she speaks her
own sentiments, as the sentiments of the <HI>Phaeacians: Nausicaa,</HI> as it
were, is withdrawn, and a whole nation introduced for a more

<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 344.—The least freedom with the sex is shame,</L>
<L>'Till our consenting sires a spouse provide.]</L></Q>
<P>This is an admirable picture of ancient female-life among the
Orientals; the Virgins were very retir'd, and never appear'd a∣mongst
men but upon extraordinary occasions, and then always
<PB N="117" REF="114"/>
in the presence of the father or mother: But when they were
married, says <HI>Eustathius,</HI> they had more liberty. Thus <HI>Helen</HI> con∣verses
freely with <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Pisistratus,</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> sometimes
with the suitors. <HI>Nausicaa</HI> delivers her judgment sententiously, to
give it more weight; what can be more modest than these expressi∣ons?
And yet they have been greatly traduc'd by Monsieur <HI>Perrault,</HI>
a <HI>French</HI> Critic; he translates the passage so as to imply that “<HI>Nau∣sicaa</HI>
disapproves of a Virgin's lying with a man without the per∣mission
of her father, before marriage;” <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> led him
into this mistake, which is sometimes used in such a signification,
but here it only means <HI>Conversation:</HI> if the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> sig∣nified
more than keeping company, it would be more ridiculous,
as <HI>Boileau</HI> observes upon <HI>Longinus,</HI> than <HI>Perrault</HI> makes it: for it
is join'd to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and then it would infer that <HI>Nausicaa</HI> disap∣proves
of a young woman's lying with <HI>several men</HI> before she was
married, without the licence of her father. The passage, continues
<HI>Boileau,</HI> is full of honour and decency: <HI>Nausicaa</HI> has a design to
introduce <HI>Ulysses</HI> to her father, she tells him she goes before to
prepare the way for his reception, but that she must not be seen
to enter the city in his company, for fear of giving offence, which
a modest woman ought not to give: A virtuous woman is obli∣ged
not only to avoid immodesty, but the appearance of it; and
for her part she could not approve of a young woman keeping
company with men without the permission of her father or mo∣ther,
before she was married. Thus the indecency is not in <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
but the Critic; it is indeed in <HI>Homer</HI> an excellent lecture of
Modesty and Morality.</P>

<P>VERSE 347. <HI>But wou'dst thou soon review thy native plain?]
Eustathius</HI> and <HI>Dacier</HI> are both of opinion, that <HI>Nausicaa</HI> had con∣ceiv'd
a passion for <HI>Ulysses:</HI> I think this passage is an evidence
that she rather admir'd and esteem'd, than lov'd him; for it is
contrary to the nature of that passion to give directions for the
departure of the person belov'd, but rather to invent excuses to
<PB N="118" REF="115"/>
prolong his stay. 'Tis true <HI>Nausicaa</HI> had wish'd in the foregoing
parts of this book, that she might have <HI>Ulysses</HI> for her husband,
or such an husband as <HI>Ulysses:</HI> but this only shews that she admir'd
his accomplishments, nor could she have added <HI>such a spouse as
he,</HI> at all, if her affections had been engag'd and fix'd upon <HI>U∣lysses</HI>

it is not the custom of the Gods to resist one the other, when
they take vengeance even upon the favourites of other Deities.
The late tempest that <HI>Neptune</HI> had rais'd for the destruction of
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> was an instance of <HI>Neptune</HI>'s implacable anger: this makes
<HI>Minerva</HI> take such measures as to avoid an open opposition, and

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
SEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS book opens with the Introduction of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> to <HI>Alcinous;</HI> every step the Poet takes
carries on the main design of the Poem,
with a progress so natural, that each incident
seems really to have happen'd, and not to be
invention. Thus <HI>Nausicaa</HI> accidentally meets
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> and introduces him to <HI>Alcinous</HI> her
father, who lands him in <HI>Ithaca:</HI> It is possi∣ble
this might be true History; the Poet might build upon a real
foundation, and only adorn the truth with the ornaments of Poe∣try.
It is to be wish'd, that a faithful History of the <HI>Trojan</HI>
war, and the voyages of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> had been transmitted to posteri∣ty;
it would have been the best comment upon the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>O∣dyssey.</HI>
We are not to look upon the Poems of <HI>Homer</HI> as meer
romances, but as true stories, heighten'd and beautify'd by Poe∣try:
<PB N="150" REF="144"/>
Thus the <HI>Iliad</HI> is built upon a real dissention, that happen'd
in a real war between <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy;</HI> and the <HI>Odyssey</HI> upon
the real voyages of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and the disorders that happen'd thro'
his absence in his own country. Nay, it is not impossible but
that many of those incidents that seem most extravagant in <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
might have an appearing truth, and be justify'd by the opi∣nions,
and mistaken credulity of those ages. What is there in
all <HI>Homer</HI> more seemingly extravagant, than the story of the race
of the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> with one broad eye in their foreheads? and yet, as
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> very judiciously conjectures, this may be built
upon a seeming truth: They were a people of <HI>Sicily</HI> remarkable
for savageness and cruelty, and perhaps might in their wars make
use of a headpiece or Vizor, which had but one sight in it, and
this might give occasion to sailors who coasted those shores to
mistake the single sight of the Vizor, for a broad eye in the fore∣head,
especially when they before look'd upon them as monsters
for their barbarity. I doubt not but we lose many beauties in
<HI>Homer</HI> for want of a real history, and think him extravagant,
when he only complies with the opinions of former ages. I
thought it necessary to make this observation, as a general vindi∣cation
of <HI>Homer;</HI> especially in this place, immediately before he
enters upon the relation of those stories which have been thought
most to outrage credibility: if then we look upon the <HI>Odyssey</HI>
as all fiction, we consider it unworthily; it ought to be read as
a story founded upon truth, but adorn'd with the embellishments
of Poetry, to convey instruction with pleasure the more effe∣ctually.</P>

<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 10. Eurymedusa <HI>nam'd.] Eustathius</HI> remarks, that
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were people of great commerce, and that it was
customary in those ages to exchange slaves in traffic; or perhaps
<HI>Eurymedusa</HI> might be a captive, pyracy then being honourable,
and such seizures of cattle or slaves frequent. The passage con∣cerning
<PB N="151" REF="145"/>
the brothers of <HI>Nausicaa</HI> has not escaped the censure of
the Critics; <HI>Homer</HI> in the original calls them <HI>like Gods,</HI> and yet in
the same breath gives them the employment of slaves, they unyoke
the Mules, and carry into the Palace the burthens they brought.
A twofold answer may be given to this objection, and this con∣duct
might proceed from the general custom of the age, which
made such actions reputable; or from the particular love the bro∣thers
bore their sister, which might induce them to act thus, as
an instance of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 20. <HI>Around him spread a veil of thicken'd air.]</HI> It may
be ask'd what occasion there is to make <HI>Ulysses</HI> invisible? <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>
answers, not only to preserve him from insults as he was
a stranger, but that he might raise a greater surprize in <HI>Alcinous</HI>
by his sudden appearance. But, adds he, the whole is an allegory;
and <HI>Ulysses</HI> wisely chusing the evening to enter unobserv'd, gave
occasion to the Poet to bring in the Goddess of Wisdom to make
him invisible.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd this passage from <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> ren∣ders
<HI>Aeneas</HI> invisible in the same manner as <HI>Minerva Ulysses. Sca∣liger</HI>
compares the two Authors, and prefers <HI>Virgil</HI> infinitely before
<HI>Homer,</HI> in the fifth book of his <HI>Poetics.</HI></P>

<L>Et multo nebulae circum Dea fudit amictu;</L>

<P><HI>Scaliger</HI> says the verses are more sonorous than <HI>Homer</HI>'s, and that
it was more necessary to make <HI>Aeneas</HI> invisible than <HI>Ulysses,</HI> he
being amongst a perfidious nation. But was not the danger
as great from the rudeness of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as from the
perfidiousness of the <HI>Carthaginians?</HI> Besides, <HI>Virgil</HI> does not men∣tion
<PB N="152" REF="146"/>
the persidiousness of the <HI>Carthaginians;</HI> so that it is the rea∣son
of <HI>Scaliger,</HI> not <HI>Virgil:</HI> and whether the verses be more sonorous,
is submitted to the ear of the Reader. He is chiefly delighted with
<Q>Et multo nebulae circum Dea fudit amictu.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Qui solus versus,</HI> says he, <HI>deterreat Graecos ab ea sententiâ, qud
suum contendunt preferendum.</HI> He allows <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be a tolerably smooth verse, <HI>Commodus &amp; rasilis,</HI> but yet
far inferior to this of <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<Q>Molirive moram, &amp; veniendi poscere causas.</Q>
<P>It is but justice to lay the verses of <HI>Homer</HI> before the Reader.</P>

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<P>I determine not which Author has the greater beauty, but un∣doubtedly
<HI>Homer</HI> is more happy in the occasion of the fiction
than <HI>Virgil; Homer</HI> drew his description from the wisdom of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
in entering the town in the evening, he was really invisi∣ble
to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> only heighten'd the truth by
Poety; but <HI>Virgil</HI> is more bold, and has no such circumstance to
justify his relation; for <HI>Aeneas</HI> went into <HI>Carthage</HI> in the open
day.</P>

ought to be employed in acts of importance, and worthy of their
divinity: It may be ask'd if <HI>Homer</HI> observes this rule in this Epi∣sode,
where a Goddess seems to appear only to direct <HI>Ulysses</HI> to the
Palace of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> which, as he himself tells us, a child could have
done? But the chief design of <HI>Minerva</HI> was to advise <HI>Ulysses</HI> in
his present exigencies: and (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks) she opens her
speech to him with great and noble sentiments. She informs
him how to win the favour of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> upon which depends
the whole happiness of her Heroe; and by which she brings a∣bout
his re-establishment in his kingdom, the aim of the whole

<P>VERSE 84, <HI>&amp;c. Arete.]</HI> It is observable that this <HI>Arete</HI>
was both wife and neice to <HI>Alcinous,</HI> an instance that the <HI>Grae∣cians</HI>
married with such near relations: The same appears from
<HI>Demosthenes</HI> and other <HI>Greek</HI> Orators. But what then is the no∣tion
of incest amongst the Ancients? The collateral branch was
not thought incestuous, for <HI>Juno</HI> was the wife and sister of <HI>Ju∣piter.</HI>
Brothers likewise married their brother's wives, as <HI>Deiphobus
Helen,</HI> after the death of <HI>Paris:</HI> the same was practis'd amongst
the <HI>Jews,</HI> and consequently being permitted by <HI>Moses</HI> was not
incestuous. So that the only incest was in the ascending, not col∣lateral
or descending branch; as when parents and children mar∣ried;
thus when <HI>Myrrha</HI> lay with her father, and <HI>Lot</HI> with his
daughters, this was accounted incest. The reason is very evident,
a child cannot pay the duty of a child to a parent, and at the
same time of a wife or husband; nor can a father act with the au∣thority
of a father towards a person who is at once his wife and
daughter. The relations interfere, and introduce confusion, where
the law of nature and reason requires regularity.</P>

<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that <HI>Homer</HI> suits his Poetry to the things he
relates, for in the whole <HI>Iliad</HI> there is not a description of
this nature, nor an opportunity to introduce it in a Poem
that represents nothing but objects of terror and blood. The
Poet himself seems to go a little out of the way to bring it
into the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> for it has no necessary connection with the Po∣em,
nor would it be less perfect if it had been omitted: but as
<HI>Mercury</HI> when he survey'd the bower of <HI>Calypso,</HI> ravish'd with the
beauty of it, stood awhile in a still admiration, so <HI>Homer</HI> delight∣ed
with the scenes he draws, stands still a few moments, and su∣spends
the story of the Poem, to enjoy the beauties of these gar∣dens
of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> But even here he shews his judgment, in not
<PB N="157" REF="151"/>
letting his fancy run out into a long description: He concludes
the whole in the compass of twenty verses, and resumes the thread
of his story. <HI>Rapine</HI> I confess censures this description of the gar∣dens:
he calls it <HI>Puerile</HI> and too light for Eloquence, that it is spun
out to too great a length, and is somewhat affected, has no
due coherence with, nor bears a just proportion to the whole,
by reason of its being too glittering. This is spoken with too great
severity: it is necessary to relieve the mind of the Reader some∣times
with gayer scenes, that it may proceed with a fresh appe∣tite
to the succeeding entertainment: In short, if it be a fault, it
is a beautiful fault; and <HI>Homer</HI> may be said here, as he was up∣on
another occasion by St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> to be <HI>dulcissimè vanus.</HI> The
admiration of the gold and silver is no blemish to <HI>Ulysses:</HI> for, as
<HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks, it proceeds not out of avarice, but from the
beauty of the work, and usefulness and magnificence of the buil∣dings.
The whole description, continues he, suits the cha∣racter
of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> a proud, luxurious people, delighted
with show and ostentation.</P>

of dogs in gold, for the ornament of his Palace; <HI>Homer</HI> ani∣mates
them in his Poetry; but to soften the description, he intro∣duces
<HI>Vulcan,</HI> and ascribes the wonder to the power of a God.
If we take the poetical dress away, the truth is, that these dogs
were form'd with such excellent art, that they seem'd to be alive,
and <HI>Homer</HI> by a liberty allowable to Poetry describes them as re∣ally
having that life, which they only have in appearance. In
the <HI>Iliad</HI> he speaks of living Tripods with greater boldness. <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI> recites another opinion of some of the Ancients, who
thought these <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> not to be animals, but a kind of large nails
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or iron pins, made use of in buildings, and to this day the

<P>VERSE 142. <HI>Close to the gates a spacious Garden lies.</HI> This
famous Garden of <HI>Alcinous</HI> contains no more than four acres of
ground, which in those times of simplicity was thought a large
one even for a Prince. It is laid out, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, into
three parts: a grove for fruits and shade, a vineyard, and an allot∣ment
for olives and herbs. It is water'd with two fountains; the one
supplies the palace and town, the other the garden and the flowers. But
it may be ask'd what reality there is in the relation, and whether
any trees bear fruit all the year in this Island? <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes,
that experience teaches the contrary, and that it is only true of
the greatest part of the year; <HI>Homer,</HI> adds he, disguises the true
situation of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and here describes it as one of the
happy Islands; at once to enrich his Poetry, and to avoid a dis∣covery
of his Poetical exaggeration. The relation is true of
other places, if <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Theophrastus</HI> deserve credit, as <HI>Dacier</HI>
observes; thus the Citron bears during the whole year fruits and
flowers. <HI>Arbos ipsa, omnibus horis pomifera, aliis cadentibus, aliis
maturescentibus, aliis vero subnascentibus.</HI> The same is related of
other trees by <HI>Pliny: Novusque fructus in his cum Annotino pendet;</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="155"/>
he affirms the like of the Pine, <HI>habet fructum maturescentem, ha∣bet
proximo anno ad maturitatem venturum, ac deinde tertio, &amp;c.</HI>
So that what <HI>Homer</HI> relates is in it self true, tho' not entirely of
<HI>Phaeacia.</HI> Or perhaps it might be only intended for a more beau∣tiful
and poetical manner of describing the constant succession of
one after another in a fertile climate.</P>

<Q>Some dry the black'ning clusters in the sun.</Q>
<P>To understand this passage aright, it is necessary to know the
manner of ordering the vintage amongst the <HI>Greeks:</HI> First, they
carried all the grapes they gather'd into an house for a season;
afterwards they exposed them ten days to the sun, and let them
lye abroad as many nights in the freshness of the air; then they
kept them five days in cool shades, and on the sixth they trod
them, and put the wine into vessels: This we learn from <HI>Hesiod:</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, verse 227.</P>

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> distinguishes the whole into three orders: First, the
grapes that have already been expos'd to the sun are trod; the se∣cond
<PB N="162" REF="156"/>
order is of the grapes that are exposed, while the others are
treading; and the third, of those that are ripe to be gathered, while
the others are thus ordering. <HI>Homer</HI> himself thus explains it, by
saying, that while some vines were loaded with black and ma∣ture
grapes, others were green, or but just turning to blackness.
<HI>Homer</HI> undoubtedly founds this poetical relation upon observing
some vines that bore fruit thrice annually. <HI>Pliny</HI> affirms this to
be true, <HI>lib. 16. chap. 27. Vites quidem &amp; triferae sunt, quas ob

a custom, as <HI>Apollonius</HI> observes, to sit mute, this gives another
reason why <HI>Ulysses</HI> used but few words in his supplication: he

<P>VERSE 287. <HI>So near approach we their celestial kind,</HI> &amp;c.]
There is some intricacy in this passage, and much labour has been
used to explain it. Some would have it to imply that, “we are
as nearly ally'd to the Gods, as the <HI>Cyclops</HI> and Giants, who are
descended from them; and if the Gods frequently appear to these
Giants who defy them; how much more may it be expected by
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> to enjoy that favour, who reverence and adore them?”
<HI>Eustathius</HI> explains it after another method; <HI>Alcinous</HI> had con∣ceiv'd
a fix'd hatred against the race of the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> who had ex∣pell'd
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> from their country, and forc'd them to seek
a new habitation; he here expresses that hatred, and says, that
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> resemble the Gods as much in goodness, as the <HI>Cy∣clops</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="160"/>
and Giants one the other in impiety: He illustrates it, by
shewing that the expression has the same import as if we should
say that <HI>Socrates</HI> comes as near to <HI>Plato</HI> in virtue, as <HI>Anytus</HI> and
<HI>Melitus</HI> to one another in wickedness; and indeed the constru∣ction

<HI>Spondanus</HI> replies, that it is the unusualness of the time,

either at their sacrifices, or in their journeys, and therefore he

<P>VERSE 326. <HI>Yet what you ask, attend—] Homer</HI> here
gives a summary of the subject of the two preceding books:
this recapitulation cannot indeed be avoided, because it is ne∣cessary
to let <HI>Alcinous</HI> into his story, and this cannot be done
without a repetition; but generally ail repetitions are tedious:
The Reader is offended when that is related which he knows al∣ready,
he receives no new instruction to entertain his judgment,
nor any new descriptions to excite his curiosity, and by these means
the very soul of Poetry is extinguish'd, and it becomes unspirit∣ed
and lifeless. When therefore repetitions are absolutely neces∣sary,
they ought always to be short; and I may appeal to the Rea∣der
if he is not tir'd with many in <HI>Homer,</HI> especially when made
in the very same words? Here indeed <HI>Ulysses</HI> tells his story but
in part; the Queen ask'd him who he was, but he passes over
this without any reply, and reserves the greatest part of his story
to a time of more <HI>leisure,</HI> that he may discover himself to a bet∣ter
advantage before the whole Peerage of the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> I do
not always condemn even the verbal repetitions of <HI>Homer,</HI> some∣times
as in embassies they may be necessary, because every word
is stamp'd with authority, and perhaps they might be customary
in <HI>Homer's</HI> times; if they were not, he had too fruitful an inven∣tion
not to have varied his thoughts and expressions. <HI>Bossu</HI> ob∣serves,
that with respect to repetitions <HI>Virgil</HI> is more exact than
<HI>Homer;</HI> for instance, in the first book of the <HI>Aeneis,</HI> when <HI>Aeneas</HI>

him com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort;

it by introducing <HI>Helenus,</HI> who hinders the repetition.</P>

passion of the Goddess <HI>Calypso,</HI> and the indecent advances
she made to detain him from his country. It is possible this re∣lation
might make some impressions upon the mind of the Rea∣der,

<HI>Homer</HI> administer to expell this poison? He does not content him∣self
with setting the chastity of <HI>Penelope</HI> in opposition to the
loose desires of <HI>Calypso,</HI> and showing the great advantage the Mor∣tal
has over the Goddess; but he here discovers the fountain from
whence this weakness rises, by saying, that neither man nor Gods
frequented this Island: on one hand the absence of the Gods, and
on the other the infrequency of objects made her yield at the

Dacier,</HI> from <HI>Eustathius,</HI> assigns the reason of the refusal of <HI>Ulysses</HI>
to comply with the proffers of <HI>Calypso,</HI> to forsake his wife and
country: It was, because he knew that women in love
promise more than they either can, or intend to perform.
An insinuation, that he would have comply'd if he had thought
the Goddess would, or could, have perform'd her promises. But
this is contrary to the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> whose greatest Glory
it is, not to have listen'd even to a Goddess. In this view he
ceases to be an Heroe, and his return is no longer a virtue, but

to pay the greater compliment to <HI>Nausicaa,</HI> and he intends to
express by it, that neither woman nor man of her years could be
expected to have such remarkable discretion. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>Such sentences being very frequent in the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> it may not
be improper to observe, of what beauty a sentence is in Epic
Poetry. A Sentence may be defin'd, a moral instruction couch'd
in few words. <HI>Rapine</HI> asserts, that sentences are more proper in
Dramatic than Heroic Poetry: for Narration is the essential chara∣cter
of it, and it ought to be one continued thread of discourse, sim∣ple
and natural, without an affectation of figures, or moral re∣flections:
that energy which some pretend to collect and inclose
within a small compass of words, is wont extremely to weaken
the rest of the discourse, and give it a forc'd air: it seems to jut
out of the structure of the Poem, and to be independent of it:
he blames <HI>Homer</HI> for scattering his sentences too plentifully thro'
his Poesy, and calls, it an affectation and imperfection.</P>
<P>These objections would undoubtedly be of weight, if the sen∣tences
were so introduc'd as to break the thread of narration, as
<HI>Rapine</HI> rightly observes. But is this the case with relation to <HI>Ho∣mer?</HI>
He puts them into the mouth of the Actors themselves,
and the narration goes on without the least interruption: It is not
the Poet who speaks, nor does he suspend the narration to make
a refin'd reflection, or give us a sentence of Morality. Is his
Poetry the worse because he makes his agents speak weightily and
sententiously? It is true, sentences used without moderation are
absurd in Epic Poetry; they give it a seriousness that is more be∣coming
the gravity of Philosophers, than the Spirit and Majesty
of Poetry. <HI>Bossu</HI> judiciously observes, that such thoughts have
<PB N="171" REF="165"/>
in their very nature a certain kind of calm Wisdom that is con∣trary
to the passions; but says he, sentences make a Poem use∣ful,
and it seems natural to imagine, that the more a work is em∣bellish'd
with them, the more it deserves that general approbation
which <HI>Horace</HI> promises to those who have the art to mix the
profitable with the pleasant. In short, sentences are not only al∣lowable
but beautiful in Heroic Poetry, if they are introduc'd
with propriety, and without affectation.</P>

<P>This is directly contrary to what is before asserted in the prece∣ding
book, where <HI>Nausicaa</HI> forbids <HI>Ulysses</HI> to attend her, to avoid
suspicion and slander: Is not <HI>Ulysses</HI> then guilty of falshood, and

disguises the truth. It will be difficult to vindicate <HI>Ulysses</HI>
from the imputation, if the notions of truth and falshood were

this standard: It is certain that anciently Lying was reckon'd no
crime by a whole nation; and it still bears a dispute, <HI>An omne

hesitation, he would have concluded him an impostor; for
it is not conceivable that he should reject all the temptations to
marriage made him by <HI>Calypso,</HI> a Goddess, and yet immediately
embrace this offer of <HI>Alcinous</HI> to marry his daughter. But if we
take the passage in another sense, and believe that <HI>Alcinous</HI> spoke
sincerely without any secret suspicions, yet his conduct is justifi∣able.
It has I confess appear'd shocking, that <HI>Alcinous,</HI> a King,
should at the very first interview offer his daughter to a stranger,
who might be a vagrant and impostor: But examples are fre∣quent
in Antiquity of marriages thus concluded between strangers,
and with as little hesitation: Thus <HI>Bellerophon, Tydeus,</HI> and <HI>Polini∣ces</HI>
were married. Great Personages regarded not riches, but
were only sollicitous to procure worthy Husbands for their daugh∣ters,
and birth and virtue were the best recommendations.</P>

know how to adapt himself to his humour, and engage his assist∣ance;

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
EIGHTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS book has been more severely censur'd
by the Critics than any in the whole <HI>O∣dyssey:</HI>
It may therefore be thought ne∣cessary
to lay before the Reader what may
be offer'd in the Poet's vindication.</P>
<P><HI>Scaliger</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI> is very warm against
it. <HI>Demodocus,</HI> observes that Critic, sings
the lusts of the Gods <HI>(foeditates)</HI> at the feast
of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> And <HI>Bossu,</HI> tho' he vindicates the Poet, remarks that
we meet with some offensive passages in <HI>Homer,</HI> and instances in
the adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>To know (says <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>) whether a thing
be well or ill spoken, we must not only examine the thing whe∣ther
it be good or ill, but we must also have regard to him that
<PB N="214" REF="206"/>
speaks or acts, and to the person to whom the Poet addresses:
for the character of the person who speaks, and of him to whom
he speaks, makes that to be good, which would not come well
from the mouth of any other person. 'Tis on this account
we vindicate <HI>Homer</HI> with respect to the Immorality that is found
in the fable of the Adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus:</HI> We must con∣sider
that it is neither the Poet, nor his Heroe, that recites that
story: but a <HI>Phaeacian</HI> sings it to <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> a soft effeminate peo∣ple,
at a festival. Besides, it is allowable even in grave and mo∣ral
writings to introduce vicious persons, who despise the Gods;
and is not the Poet oblig'd to adapt his Poetry to the characters
of such persons? And had it not been an absurdity in him to
have given us a Philosophical or Moral song before a people who
would be pleas'd with nothing but gaiety and effeminacy? The
Moral that we are to draw from this story is, that an idle and
soft course of life is the source of all criminal pleasures; and that
those persons who lead such lives, are generally pleas'd to hear
such stories, as make their betters partakers in the same vices.
This relation of <HI>Homer</HI> is a useful lesson to them who desire to
live virtuously; and it teaches, that if we would not be guilty of
such vices, we must avoid such a method of life as inevitably
leads to the practice of them.</P>
<P><HI>Rapine</HI> attacks this book on another side, and blames it not
for its Immorality, but Lowness. <HI>Homer,</HI> says he, puts off that
air of grandeur and majesty which so properly belongs to his
character, he debases himself into a Droll, and sinks into a fami∣liar
way of talking: he turns things into ridicule, by endeavour∣ing
to entertain his Reader with something pleasant and divert∣ing:
For instance, in the eighth book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> he enter∣tains
the Gods with a Comedy, some of whom he makes buf∣foons:
<HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> are introduced upon the stage, taken in
a net laid by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> contrary to the gravity which is so essential
to Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>It must be granted, that the Gods are here painted in colours
unworthy of Deities, yet still with propriety, if we respect the
<PB N="215" REF="207"/>
spectators, who are ignorant, debauch'd <HI>Phaeacians, Homer</HI> was
oblig'd to draw them not according to his own idea of the Gods,
but according to the wild fancies of the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> The Poet
is not at liberty to ascribe the wisdom of a <HI>Socrates</HI> to <HI>Alcinous:</HI>
He must follow Nature, and like a painter he may draw Deities
or monsters, and introduce as he pleases either vicious or virtuous
characters, provided he always makes them of a piece, consistent
with their first representation.</P>
<P>This rule of <HI>Aristotle</HI> in general vindicates <HI>Homer,</HI> and 'tis ne∣cessary
to carry it in our minds, because it ought to be apply'd
to all incidents that relate to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> in the sequel of the
<HI>Odyssey.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 9. <HI>In form a herald—.]</HI> It may be ask'd what
occasion there is to introduce a Goddess, to perform an action
that might have been as well executed by a real Herald? <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>
observes, that this <HI>Minerva</HI> is either Fame, which informs
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> that a stranger of uncommon figure is arriv'd,
and upon this report they assemble; or it implies, that this assem∣bly
was made by the Wisdom of die Peers, and consequently a
Poet may ascribe it to the Goddess of Wisdom, it being the ef∣fect
of her inspiration.</P>
<P>The Poet by the introduction of a Deity warns us, that some∣thing
of importance is to succeed; this is to be usher'd in with
solemnity, and consequently the appearance of <HI>Minerva</HI> in this
place is not unnecessary; The, action of importance to be describ'd
<PB N="216" REF="208"/>

They were fond of strangers: The Goddess therefore tells them,
that a stranger is arriv'd of a God-like appearance. They admir'd
outward show, he is therefore describ'd as a man of extraordina∣ry

circumstance has been repeated several times almost in the same

that such repetitions are beauties. In any other Poet, they
might have been thought to proceed from a poverty of inventi∣on,
tho' certainly not in <HI>Homer,</HI> in whom there is rather a super∣fluity
than barrenness. Perhaps having once said a thing well, he
despair'd of improving it, and so repeated it; or perhaps he in∣tended
to inculcate this truth, that all our accomplishments, as
beauty, strength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the gifts of the Gods; and being wil∣ling
to fix it upon the mind, he dwells upon it, and inserts it
in many places. Here indeed it has a particular propriety, as it
is a circumstance that first engages the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> in the favour
of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> his beauty was his first recommendation, and conse∣quently
the Poet with great judgment sets his Heroe off to the
best advantage, it being an incident from which he dates all his
future happiness; and therefore to be insisted upon with a parti∣cular
solemnity. <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Theaetetus</HI> applies the latter part of

<P>VERSE 25. <HI>From his glitt'ring throne</HI> Alcinous <HI>rose.]</HI> It might
be expected that <HI>Ulysses,</HI> upon whose account alone <HI>Alcinous</HI> calls
this assembly, should have made his condition known, and spoken
himself to the <HI>Phaeacians;</HI> whereas he appears upon the stage as
a mute person, and the multitude departs entirely ignorant of
his name and fortunes. It may be answer'd, that this was not a
proper time for a fuller discovery, the Poet defers it 'till <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
had distinguish'd himself in the games, and fully rais'd
their curiosity. It is for the same reason that <HI>Ulysses</HI> is silent; if
he had spoken he could not have avoided to let them into the
knowledge of his condition, but the contrary method is greatly
for his advantage, and assures him of success from the recom∣mendation
of a King.</P>
<P>But there is another, and perhaps a better reason, to be given
for this silence of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> The Poet reserves the whole story of
his sufferings for an entire and uninterrupted narration; if he
had now made any discovery, he must afterwards either have
fall'n into tautology, or broken the thread of the relation, so that
it would not have been of a piece, but wanted continuity. Be∣sides,
it comes with more weight at once, than if it had been
made at several times, and consequently makes a deeper impres∣sion
upon the memory and passion of the auditors. <HI>Virgil</HI> has
taken a different method in the discovery of <HI>Aeneas;</HI> there was a
necessity for it; his companions, to engage <HI>Dido</HI> in their protecti∣on,
tell her they belong to no less a Heroe than <HI>Aeneas,</HI> so that
he is in a manner known before he appears; but <HI>Virgil</HI> after the
example of <HI>Homer</HI> reserves his story for an entire narration.</P>

of the <HI>Greeks</HI> before <HI>Troy,</HI> so does <HI>Homer</HI> in his <HI>Iliads.</HI></P>
<P>If this be true, it must be allow'd that <HI>Homer</HI> has found out
a way of commending himself very artfully: Had he spoken
plainly, he had been extravagantly vain; but by this indirect
way of praise, the Reader is at liberty to apply it either solely to
<HI>Demodocus,</HI> or obliquely to <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that <HI>Homer</HI> takes a very extraordinary care
of <HI>Demodocus</HI> his brother Poet; and introduces him as a person
of great distinction. He calls him in this book the Heroe <HI>Demo∣docus:</HI>
He places him on a throne studded with silver, and gives
him an herald for his attendant; nor is he less careful to provide
for his entertainment, he has a particular table, and a capacious
bowl set before him to drink as often as he had a mind, as
the original expresses it. Some merry wits have turn'd the last
circumstance into raillery, and insinuate that <HI>Homer</HI> in this place
as well as in the former means himself in the person of <HI>Demodocus,</HI>
an intimation that he would not be displeas'd to meet with the
like hospitality.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="212"/>
with sobriety and moderation, and if in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> we see <HI>A∣chilles</HI>
and <HI>Ulysses</HI> in contention to the great satisfaction of <HI>Aga∣memnon;</HI>
it is because these contentions are of use to his affairs,
they contend whether force or stratagem is to be employed to
take <HI>Troy; Achilles</HI> after the death of <HI>Hector,</HI> persuaded to assault
it by storm, <HI>Ulysses</HI> by stratagem. There is a further reason giv∣en
for the satisfaction which <HI>Agamemnon</HI> expresses at the contest of
these two Heroes: Before the opening of the war of <HI>Troy</HI> he con∣sulted
the oracle concerning the issue of it; <HI>Apollo</HI> answer'd, that
<HI>Troy</HI> should be taken when two Princes most renown'd for wis∣dom
and valour should contend at a sacrifice of the Gods; <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI>

<P>VERSE 79. <HI>Touch'd at the song.—]</HI> Many objections may
be made against this relation; it may seem to offend against pro∣bability,
and appears somewhat incredible, that <HI>Demodocus</HI> should
thus luckily pitch upon the war of <HI>Troy</HI> for the subject of his
song, and still more happily upon the deeds of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for in∣stance,
a man may die of an Apoplexy, this is probable; but that
this should happen just when the Poet has occasion for it, is
in some degree incredible. But this objection will cease, if we
consider not only that the war of <HI>Troy</HI> was the greatest e∣vent
of those ages, and consequently might be the com∣mon
subject of entertainment; but also that it is not <HI>Homer</HI> or
<HI>Demodocus</HI> who relates the story, but the Muse who inspires it:
<HI>Homer</HI> several times in this book ascribes the song to immediate
inspiration; and this supernatural assistance reconciles it to human
probability, and the story becomes credible when it is suppos'd
to be related by a Deity. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI> commends this
conduct as artful and judicious; <HI>Alcinous,</HI> says he, invites <HI>Ulysses</HI>
to an entertainment to divert him, where <HI>Demodocus</HI> sings his a∣ctions,
at which he cannot refrain from tears, which <HI>Alcinous</HI> per∣ceives,
and this brings about the discovery of <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="213"/>
It may further be objected, that a sufficient cause for this vi∣olence
of tears is not apparent; for why should <HI>Ulysses</HI> weep to hear
his own brave atchievements, especially when nothing calamitous
is recited? This indeed would be improbable, if that were the
whole of what the Poet sung: But <HI>Homer</HI> only gives us the heads
of the song, a few sketches of a larger draught, and leaves some∣thing
to be fill'd up by the imagination of the reader. Thus
for instance the words of <HI>Demodocus</HI> recall'd to the mind of <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
all the hardships he had undergone during a ten years war,
all the scenes of horror he had beheld, and the loss and sufferings of
all his friends. And no doubt he might weep even for the calamities
he brought upon <HI>Troy,</HI> an ingenuous nature cannot be insensible
when any of its own species suffers; the <HI>Trojans</HI> were his enemies,
but still they were men, and compassion is due even to unfortu∣nate
enemies. I doubt not but it will be allow'd, that there is
here suffcient cause to draw tears from a heroe, unless a heroe
must be supposed to be divested of humanity.</P>

<Q><L>VERSE 129.—<HI>What space the hinds allow</HI></L>
<L>Between the Mule and Ox, from plow to plow.]</L></Q>
<P>This image drawn from rural affairs is now become obsolete, and
gives us no distinct Idea of the distance between <HI>Clytoneus</HI> and the
other racers: but this obscurity arises not from <HI>Homer</HI>'s want of
perspicuity, but from the change which has happen'd in the me∣thod
of tillage, and from a length of time which has effaced the
distinct image which was originally stamp'd upon it; so that what
was understood universally in the days of <HI>Homer</HI> is grown almost
unintelligible to posterity. <HI>Eustathius</HI> only observes, that the teams
of Mules were placed at some distance from the teams of Oxen;
the Mule being more swift in his labour than the Ox, and con∣sequently
more ground was allow'd to the Mule than the Ox by
the Husbandman. This gives us an Idea that <HI>Clytoneus</HI> was the
foremost of the racers, but how much is not to be discover'd
with any certainty. <HI>Aristarchus,</HI> as <HI>Didymus</HI> informs us, thus in∣terprets
<HI>Homer.</HI> “As much as a yoke of mules set to work
at the same time with a yoke of oxen, outgoes the oxen,
(for mules are swifter than oxen) so much <HI>Clytoneus</HI> out∣went

'Tis true <HI>Hesiod</HI> calls a person a youth, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who was forty
years of age, but this must be understood with some allowance,
unless we suppose that the life of man was longer in the times of

from many places in <HI>Homer,</HI> where the shortness of man's life is

<P>It may be thought that <HI>Ulysses,</HI> both here and in his subsequent

allows upon his own accomplishments: But self-praise is some∣times
no fault. <HI>Plutarch</HI> has wrote a dissertation, how a man
<PB N="226" REF="218"/>
may praise himself without envy: What <HI>Ulysses</HI> here speaks is not
a boast but a justification. Persons in distress, says <HI>Plutarch,</HI> may
speak of themselves with dignity: It shews a greatness of soul,
and that they bear up against the storms of fortune with bravery;
they have too much courage to fly to pity and commiseration,
which betray despair and an hopeless condition: Such a man
struggling with ill fortune shews himself a champion, and if by
a bravery of speech he transforms himself from miserable and ab∣ject,
into bold and noble, he is not to be censur'd as vain or ob∣stinate,
but great and invincible.</P>
<P>This is a full justification of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> he opposes virtue to ca∣lumny;
and what <HI>Horace</HI> applies to himself we apply to this
Heroe.</P>
<Q>Quaesitam meritis, sume superbiam.</Q>
<P>Besides, it was necessary to shew himself a person of figure and
distinction, to recommend his condition to the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> He
was a stranger to the whole nation, and he therefore takes a pro∣bable
method to engage their assistance by acquainting them with

brought down from heaven to act what might have been done
as well by any of the spectators, namely to proclaim what was
self-evident, the victory of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> When a Deity appears, our
expectations are awaken'd for the introduction of something im∣portant,
but what action of importance succeeds? 'Tis true, her
appearance encourages <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and immediately upon it he chal∣lenges
the whole <HI>Phaeacian</HI> assembly. But he was already victor,
and no further action is perform'd. If indeed she had appear'd
<PB N="227" REF="219"/>
openly in favour of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> this would have been greatly advan∣tagious
to him, and the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> must have highly reverenc'd a
person who was so remarkably honour'd by a Goddess: but it is
not evident that the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> or even <HI>Ulysses</HI> knew the Deity,
but took her for a man as she appear'd to be; and <HI>Ulysses</HI> him∣self
immediately rejoices that he had found a friend in the as∣sembly.
If this be true, the descent of <HI>Pallas</HI> will prove very
unnecessary; for if she was esteem'd to be meerly human, she acts
nothing in the character of a Deity, and performs no more than
might have been performed by a man, and consequently gave no
greater courage to <HI>Ulysses</HI> than a friend actually gave, for such on∣ly
he believ'd her to be. <HI>Eustathius</HI> appears to be of the same

the beginning of his oration: Here the heat of it is cool'd, and

feasting. Thus the Poet all along writes consistently: We may

<P>VERSE 301. <HI>Skill'd in the dance—]</HI> I beg leave to trans∣late
<HI>Dacier</HI>'s Annotation upon this passage, and to offer a remark
upon it. This description, says that Lady, is remarkable, not
because the dancers mov'd to the sound of the harp and the
song; for in this there is nothing extraordinary: but in that they
danc'd, if I may so express it, an History; that is, by their ge∣stures
and movements they express'd what the music of the harp
and voice described, and the dance was a representation of what
was the subject of the Poet's song. <HI>Homer</HI> only says they danc'd
divinely, according to the obvious meaning of the words. I fan∣cy
Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> would have forborn her observation, if she had
reflected upon the nature of the song to which the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
danc'd: It was an intrigue between <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus;</HI> and they
being taken in some very odd postures, she must allow
that these dancers represented some very odd gestures, (or
movements as she expresses it) if they were now dancing an Hi∣story,
that is acting in their motions what was the subject of the
song. But I submit to the judgment of Ladies, and shall
only add, that this is an instance how a critical eye can see some
things in an Author, that were never intended by him;
tho' to do her justice, she borrowed the general remark from
<HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>The words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are very expressive,

<P>The Reader may be pleased to look back to the beginning of

<HI>Homer; Demodocus Deorum canit foeditates, noster Iöpas res rege dig∣nas.</HI>
Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> in his Annotations upon <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Poetics
refutes the objection. The song of <HI>Demodocus,</HI> says he, is as well
adapted to the inclinations and relish of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as the
song of <HI>Iöpas</HI> is to Queen <HI>Dido.</HI> It may indeed be question'd
whether the subject of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s song be well chosen, and whether
the deepest points of Philosophy were entirely proper to be sung
to a Queen, and her female attendants.</P>

<P>So that if either of the Poets are to be blamed, 'tis certainly <HI>Vir∣gil:</HI>
but neither of them, adds that Critic, are culpable: <HI>Virgil</HI> un∣derstood
what a chaste Queen ought to hear before strangers, and
what women might say when alone amongst themselves; thus to
<PB N="233" REF="225"/>
the Queen he sings a philosophical song, the intrigues of <HI>Mars</HI>
and <HI>Venus</HI> amongst Nymphs when they were alone.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> vindicates this story of <HI>Homer:</HI> There is a way of
teaching by mute actions, and those very fables that have given
most offence, furnish us with useful contemplations: Thus in the
story of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> some have by an unnecessary violence
endeavour'd to reduce it into allegory: When <HI>Venus</HI> is in con∣junction
with the Star called <HI>Mars,</HI> they have an adultrous in∣fluence,
but time, or the sun, reveals it. But the Poet himself
far better explains the meaning of his fable, for he teaches that
light music and wanton songs debauch the manners, and
incline men to an unmanly way of living in luxury and
wantonness.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions this story, <HI>Ovid</HI> translates it, <HI>Plutarch</HI>
commends it, and <HI>Scaliger</HI> censures it. I will add the judgment
of a late Writer, Monsieur <HI>Boileau,</HI> concerning <HI>Scaliger,</HI> in his
Notes upon <HI>Longinus.</HI> “That proud scholar, says he, intend∣ing
to erect altars to <HI>Virgil,</HI> as he expresses it, speaks of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
too prophanely; but it is a book which he calls in part
<HI>Hypercritical,</HI> to shew that he transgressed the bounds of true
Criticism: That piece was a dishonour to <HI>Scaliger,</HI> and he fell
into such gross errors, that he drew upon him the ridicule of all

be surety for a wicked person; and therefore <HI>Neptune</HI> should not
give his promise for <HI>Mars</HI> thus taken in adultery. Some
take it generally; suretyship is detrimental, and it is the lot of un∣happy

the following order, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
<HI>Sponsiones sunt infelices, &amp; hominum est infelicium sponsio∣nes

condition; then the sentence will bear this import: If <HI>Mars,</HI> says
<HI>Vulcan,</HI> refuses to discharge the penalty, how shall I compell <HI>Neptune</HI>
to pay it, who is so greatly my superior? And therefore adds by
way of sentence, that the sponsor ought to be of the same station

Thus the <HI>Gordian</HI> knot was famous in antiquity. And this knot

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: This is the reason why he is said to have
learned it from <HI>Circe;</HI> it was of great esteem amongst the Anci∣ents,

<P>A Poet would now appear ridiculous if he should introduce a

what now is; customs and arts are never at a stay, and conse∣quently
the ideas of customs and arts are as changeable as those

Whereas the tears alone of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are intended to be
compared to the tears of the matron. It is the sorrow of the
two persons, not the persons themselves, that is represented in the
comparison. But there appears no sufficient cause for the tears of
<HI>Ulysses;</HI> this objection would not have been made, if the subject
of the song had been consider'd; it sets before his eyes all the cala∣mities
of a long war, all the scenes of slaughter of friends and
enemies that he had beheld in it: It is also to be remember'd,
that we have only the abridgment of the song, and yet we see
spectacles of horror, blood, and commiseration. Tears discover a
tender, not an abject spirit. <HI>Achilles</HI> is not less a Heroe for
weeping over the ashes of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> nor <HI>Ulysses</HI> for lamenting the
calamities and deaths of thousands of his friends.</P>

<P>VERSE 606. <HI>In wond'rous ships self-mov'd, instinct with mind.]</HI> There is not a passage that more outrages all the rules of credi∣bility
than the description of these ships of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> The Poet
inserts these wonders only to shew the great dexterity of the <HI>Phae∣acians</HI>
in navigation; and indeed it was necessary to be very full
<PB N="243" REF="235"/>
in the description of their skill, who were to convey <HI>Ulysses</HI> home
in despight of the very God of the Ocean. It is for the same
reason that they are describ'd as sailing almost invisibly, to escape
the notice of that God. Antiquity animated every thing in Po∣etry;
thus <HI>Argo</HI> is said to have had a mast made of <HI>Dodonaan</HI>
oak, indued with the faculty of speech. But this is defending
one absurdity, by instancing in a fable equally absurd; all that
can be said in defence of it is, that such extravagant fables were
believ'd, at least by the vulgar, in former ages; and conse∣quently
might be introduced without blame in Poetry; if so, by
whom could a boast of this nature be better made, than by a
vain <HI>Phaeacian?</HI> Besides, these extravagancies let <HI>Ulysses</HI> into the
humour of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and in the following books he adapts
his story to it, and returns fable for fable. It must likewise cer∣tainly
be a great encouragement to <HI>Ulysses</HI> to find himself in such
hands as could so easily restore him to his country; for it was na∣tural
to conclude, that though <HI>Alcinous</HI> was guilty of great am∣plification,
yet that his subjects were very expert navigators.</P>

<HEAD>XLVI.</HEAD>
<Q><L>VERSE 619.—<HI>how by his command</HI></L>
<L>Firm-rooted in the surge a ship should stand.</L></Q>
<P>The Antients, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, mark these verses with an
Obelisk and Asterism. The Obelisk shew'd that they judg'd what
relates to the oracle was mis-placed, the Asterism denoted that they
thought the verses very beautiful. For they thought it not pro∣bable
that <HI>Alcinous</HI> would have call'd to memory this prediction
and the menace of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and yet persisted to conduct to his
own country the enemy of that Deity: Whereas if this oracle be
supposed to be forgotten by <HI>Alcinous,</HI> (as it will, if these verses be
taken away) then there will be an appearance of truth, that he
who was a friend to all strangers, should be persuaded to land so
great and worthy a Heroe as <HI>Ulysses</HI> in his own dominions, and
therefore they reject them to the 13th of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> But as
<HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, <HI>Alcinous</HI> immediately subjoins,
<Q><PB N="244" REF="236"/>
<L>But this the Gods may frustrate or fulfill,</L>
<L>As suits the purpose of th' eternal will.</L></Q>
And therefore the verses may be very proper in this book, for
<HI>Alcinous</HI> believes that the Gods might be prevailed upon not to
fulfill this denunciation. It has been likewise remark'd that the
conduct of <HI>Alcinous</HI> is very justifiable: The <HI>Phaeacians</HI> had been
warn'd by an oracle, that an evil threaten'd them for the care
they should shew to a stranger; yet they forbear not to perform
an act of piety to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> being persuaded that men ought to
do their duty, and trust the issue to the goodness of the Gods.
This will seem to be more probable, if we remember <HI>Alcinous</HI>
is ignorant that <HI>Ulysses</HI> is the person intended by the prediction,
so that he is not guilty of a voluntary opposition to the Gods,
but really acts with piety in assisting his guest, and only com∣plies
with the common laws of hospitality.</P>
<P>It is but a conjecture, yet it is not without probability, that
there was a rock which look'd like a vessel, in the entrance of
the haven of the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> the fable may be built upon this
foundation, and because it was environ'd by the ocean, the trans∣formation
might be ascrib'd to the God of it.</P>

<HEAD>XLVII.</HEAD>
<Q><L>VERSE 621.—<HI>How mound on mound</HI></L>
<L>Should bury these proud tow'rs beneath the ground.]</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> word is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which does not necessarily
imply that the city should be buried actually, but that a moun∣tain
should surround it, or cover it round; and in the 13th book
we find that when the ship was transformed into a rock, the city
continues out of danger. <HI>Eustathius</HI> is fully of opinion, that the
city was threaten'd to be overwhelm'd by a mountain; the Poet,
says he, invents this fiction to prevent posterity from searching after
this Isle of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and to preserve his story from detection
of falsification; after the same manner as he introduces <HI>Neptune</HI>
<PB N="245" REF="237"/>
and the rivers of <HI>Troy,</HI> bearing away the wall which the <HI>Greeks</HI>
had rais'd as a fortification before their navy. But <HI>Dacier,</HI> in the
omissions which she inserts at the end of the second volume of
her <HI>Odyssey,</HI> is of a contrary opinion, for the mountain is not said
to cover the city, but to threaten to cover it: as appears from the
13th book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> where <HI>Alcinous</HI> commands a sacrifice to
the Gods to avert the execution of this denunciation.</P>
<P>But the difference in reality is small, the city is equally threat∣en'd
to be buried as the vessel to be transform'd; and therefore
<HI>Alcinous</HI> might pronounce the same fate to both, since both were
threaten'd equally by the prediction; it was indeed impossible for
him to speak after any other manner, for he only repeats the words
of the oracle, and cannot foresee that the sacrifice of the <HI>Phaeaci∣ans</HI>
would appease the anger of <HI>Neptune.</HI></P>

<Q><L>VERSE 635. <HI>Or bled some friend? who bore a brother's part,</HI></L>

<P>This excellent sentence of <HI>Homer</HI> at once guides us in the choice,
and instructs us in the regard, that is to be paid to the person of a
Friend. If it be lawful to judge of a man from his writings, <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
had a soul susceptible of real friendship; and was a lover of
sincerity. It would be endless to take notice of every casual in∣struction
inserted in the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> but such sentences show <HI>Homer</HI>
to have been a man of an amiable character, as well as excellent
in Poetry: The great abhorrence he had of Lies cannot be more
strongly exprest than in those two passages in the ninth <HI>Iliad,</HI> and
in the 14th <HI>Odyssey:</HI> In the first of which he makes the man of
the greatest soul, <HI>Achilles,</HI> bear testimony to his aversion of them;
and in the latter declares, that “the poorest man, tho' compell'd by
the utmost necessity, ought not to stoop to such a practice”. In
this place he shews that worth creates a kind of relation, and that
we are to look upon a worthy friend, as a brother.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
NINTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S we are now come to the Episodical part
of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> it may be thought neces∣sary
to speak something of the nature of
Episodes.</P>
<P>As the action of the Epic is always one,
entire, and great Action; so the most trivi∣al
Episodes must be so interwoven with it,
as to be necessary parts, or convenient,
as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> observes, to carry on the
main design: either so necessary, as without them the Poem must
be imperfect, or so convenient, that no others can be imagin'd
more suitable to the place in which they stand: There is no∣thing
to be left void, in a firm building, even the cavities ought
not to be fill'd up with rubbish destructive to the strength of it,
but with materials of the same kind, tho' of less pieces, and fit∣ted
to the main fabric.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="279"/>
<HI>Aristotle</HI> tells us, that what is comprehended in the first plat∣form
of the fable is proper, the rest is Episode: Let us exa∣mine
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> by this rule: The groundwork of the Poem is,
a Prince absent from his country several years, <HI>Neptune</HI> hinders
his return, yet at last he breaks thro' all obstacles, and re∣turns,
where he finds great disorders, the Authors of which he
punishes, and restores peace to his kingdoms. This is all that is
essential to the model; this the Poet is not at liberty to change;
this is so necessary, that any alteration destroys the design, spoils
the fable, and makes another Poem of it. But Episodes are
changeable; for instance, tho' it was necessary that <HI>Ulysses</HI> being
absent should spend several years with foreign Princes, yet it was
not necessary that one of these Princes should be <HI>Antiphates,</HI> ano∣ther
<HI>Alcinous,</HI> or that <HI>Circe</HI> or <HI>Calypso</HI> should be the persons who
entertain'd him: It was in the Poet's choice to have chang'd these
persons and states, without changing his design or fable. Thus tho'
these adventures or Episodes become parts of the subject after they
are chosen, yet they are not originally essential to the subject. But
in what sense then are they necessary? The reply is, Since the ab∣sence
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> was absolutely necessary, it follows that not being
at home, he must be in some other country; and therefore tho'
the Poet was at liberty to make use of none of these particular
adventures, yet it was not in his choice to make use of none at
all; if these had been omitted, he must have substituted others,
or else he would have omitted part of the matter contain'd in his
model, <HI>viz.</HI> the adventures of a person long absent from his
country; and the Poem would have been defective. So that Epi∣sodes
are not actions, but parts of an action. It is in Poetry, as
<HI>Aristotle</HI> observes, as in Painting; a Painter puts many actions
into one piece, but they all conspire to form one entire and per∣fect
Action: A Poet likewise uses many Episodes, but all those
Episodes taken separately finish nothing, they are but imperfect
members, which all together make one and the same action, like
the parts of a human body, they all conspire to constitute the
whole man.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="280"/>
In a word, the Episodes of <HI>Homer</HI> are compleat Episodes; they
are proper to the subject, because they are drawn from the ground
of the fable; they are so joyn'd to the principal action, that one
is the necessary consequence of the other, either truly or probably:
and lastly, they are imperfect members which do not make a
compleat and finish'd body; for an Episode that makes a com∣pleat
action, cannot be part of a principal action, as is essential
to all Episodes.</P>
<P>An Episode may then be defin'd, “a necessary part of an action,
extended by probable circumstances.” They are part of an action,
for they are not added to the principal action, but only dilate
and amplify that principal action: Thus the Poet to shew the
sufferings of <HI>Ulysses</HI> brings in the several Episodes of <HI>Polyphemus,
Scylla,</HI> the <HI>Sirens, &amp;c.</HI> But why should the words “extended
by probable circumstances” enter the definition? Because the
Sufferings of <HI>Ulysses</HI> are propos'd in the model of the Fable in
general only, but by relating the circumstances, the manner how
he suffer'd is discover'd, and this connects it with the principal
action, and shews very evidently the necessary relation the Epi∣sode
bears to the main design of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> What I have said
I hope plainly discovers the difference between the Episodic and
Principal action, as well as the nature of Episodes. See <HI>Bossu</HI>
more largely upon this subject.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 3. <HI>How sweet the products of a peaceful reign,</HI> &amp;c.]
This passage has given great joy to the Critics, as it has afforded
them the ill-natur'd pleasure of railing, and the satisfaction of be∣lieving
they have found a fault in a good Writer. It is fitter,
say they, for the mouth of <HI>Epicurus</HI> than for the sage <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to
extol the pleasures of feasting and drinking in this manner: He
whom the Poet proposes as the standard of human Wisdom, says
<HI>Rapine,</HI> suffers himself to be made drunk by the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> But it
may rather be imagin'd, that the Critic was not very sober when
he made the reflection; for there is not the least appearance of a
<PB N="308" REF="281"/>
reason for that imputation. <HI>Plato</HI> indeed in his third book <HI>de
Repub.</HI> writes, that what <HI>Ulysses</HI> here speaks is no very proper ex∣ample
of temperance: but every body knows that <HI>Plato,</HI>
with respect; to <HI>Homer,</HI> wrote with great partiality. <HI>Athenae∣us</HI>
in his 12th book gives us the following interpretation. <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
accommodates his discourse to the present occasion; he in
appearance approves of the voluptuous lives of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI>
and having heard <HI>Alcinous</HI> before say, that feasting and singing,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> was their supreme delight; he by a seasonable flattery seems
to comply with their inclinations: it being the most proper me∣thod
to attain his desires of being convey'd to his own country.
He compares <HI>Ulysses</HI> to the <HI>Polypus,</HI> which is fabled to assume the
colour of every rock to which he approaches: Thus <HI>Sophocles,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
That is, “In your accesses to mankind observe the <HI>Polypus,</HI>
and adapt your self to the humour of the person to whom
you apply.” <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that this passage has been
condemn'd, but he defends it after the very same way with
<HI>Athenaeus.</HI></P>
<P>It is not impossible but there may be some compliance
with the nature and manners of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> especially be∣cause
<HI>Ulysses</HI> is always describ'd as an artful man, not with∣out
some mixture of dissimulation: But it is no difficult mat∣ter
to take the passage literally, and yet give it an irreproach∣able
sense. <HI>Ulysses</HI> had gone thro' innumerable calamities, he had
liv'd to see a great part of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> laid desolate by a
bloody war; and after so many troubles, he arrives among a na∣tion
that was unacquainted with all the miseries of war, where all
the people were happy, and pass'd their lives in ease and pleasures:
this calm life fills him with admiration, and he artfully praises
what he found praise-worthy in it; namely, the entertainments
and music, and passes over the gallantries of the people, as <HI>Da∣cier</HI>
observes, without any mention. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> fully vin∣dicates
<PB N="309" REF="282"/>
<HI>Homer.</HI> It is my opinion, says that Author, that the
Poet, by representing these guests in the midst of their entertain∣ment,
delighted with the song and music, intended to recom∣mend
a more noble pleasure than eating or drinking, such a plea∣sure
as a wise man may imitate, by approving the better part,
and rejecting the worse, and chusing to please the ear rather than
the belly. 12 <HI>Dissert.</HI></P>
<P>If we understand the passage otherwise, the meaning may
be this. I am persuaded, says <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that the most agreeable end
which a King can propose, is to see a whole nation in universal
joy, when music and feastings are in every house, when plenty is
on every table, and wines to entertain every guest; This to me
appears a state of the greatest felicity.</P>
<P>In this sense <HI>Ulysses</HI> pays <HI>Alcinous</HI> a very agreeable compliment;
as it is certainly the most glorious aim of a King to make his
subjects happy, and diffuse an universal joy thro' his domi∣nions:
He must be a rigid Censor indeed who blames such plea∣sures
as these, which have nothing contrary in them to Virtue
and strict Morality; especially as they here bear a beautiful op∣position
to all the horrors which <HI>Ulysses</HI> had seen in the wars of
<HI>Troy,</HI> and shew <HI>Phaeacia</HI> as happy as <HI>Troy</HI> was miserable. I will
only add, that this agrees with the oriental way of speaking; and
in the Poetical parts of the Scriptures, the voice of melody,
feasting, and dancing, are used to express the happiness of a nation,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 19. <HI>Behold</HI> Ulysses!—] The Poet begins with
declaring the name of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> had already been
acquainted with it by the song of <HI>Demodocus,</HI> and therefore
it could not fail of raising the utmost attention and curiosi∣ty
(as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes) of the whole assembly, to hear the
story of so great an Heroe. Perhaps it may be thought that <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
is ostentatious, and speaks of himself too favourably; but
the necessity of it will appear, if we consider that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had no∣thing
<PB N="310" REF="283"/>
but his personal qualifications to engage the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> in
his favour. It was therefore requisite to make those qualificati∣ons
known, and this was not possible to be done but by his own
relation, he being a stranger among strangers. Besides, he speaks
before a vain-glorious people, who thought even boasting no
fault. It may be question'd whether <HI>Virgil</HI> be so happy in these
respects, when he puts almost the same words into the mouth of
<HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Sum pius Aeneas, raptos qui ex hoste penates</L>
<L>Classe veho mecum, famd super aethera notus.</L></Q>
<P>For his boast contributes nothing to the re-establishment of his
affairs, for he speaks to the Goddess <HI>Venus.</HI> Yet <HI>Scaliger</HI> infi∣nitely
prefers <HI>Virgil</HI> before <HI>Homer,</HI> tho' there be no other difference
in the words, than <HI>raptos qui ex hoste penates,</HI> instead of
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</L></Q>
He questions whether Subtilties, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, ever rais'd any person's
glory to the Heavens; whereas that is the reward of piety. But
the word is to be understood to imply Wisdom, and all the stra∣tagems
of war, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the first verse of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
<Q>The Man for Wisdom's various arts renown'd.</Q>
He is not less severe upon the verses immediately preceding,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
which lines are undoubtedly very beautiful, and admirably ex∣press
the number of the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> the multitude of
them is so great, that they almost confound him; and he seems
at a loss where to begin, how to proceed, or where to end; and
<PB N="311" REF="284"/>
they agree very well with the proposition in the opening of the
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> which was to relate the sufferings of a brave man. The
verses which <HI>Scaliger</HI> quotes are
<Q><L>Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem;</L>
<L>Trojanas ut opes, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<HI>Omnia sanè non sine suâ divinitate,</HI> and he concludes, that <HI>Virgil</HI>
has not so much imitated <HI>Homer,</HI> as taught us how <HI>Homer</HI> ought
to have wrote.</P>

<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 21.—Ithaca <HI>the fair, Where high</HI> Neritus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]
<HI>Eustathius</HI> gives various interpretations of this position of <HI>Itha∣ca;</HI>
some understand it to signify that it lies low; others explain
it to signify that it is of a low position, but high with respect: to
the neighbouring Islands; others take <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<HI>excellentissima</HI>)
in another sense to imply the excellence of the country, which
tho' it lies low, is productive of brave inhabitants, for <HI>Homer</HI>
immediately adds <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Strabo</HI> gives a different
exposition; <HI>Ithaca</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as it lies near to the Continent,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as it is the utmost of all the Islands towards
the North, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for thus <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is to be understood.
So that <HI>Ithaca,</HI> adds he, is not of a low situation, but as it lies
oppos'd to the Continent, nor the most lofty (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) but
the most extream of the northern Islands; for so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
signifies. <HI>Dacier</HI> differs from <HI>Strabo</HI> in the explication of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which he believes to mean the South; she applies the
words to the East, or South-east, and appeals to the maps which
so describe it. It is the most northern of the Islands, and joyns
to the Continent of <HI>Epirus;</HI> it has <HI>Dulichium</HI> on the east, and on
the south <HI>Samos</HI> and <HI>Zacynthus.</HI></P>

in the same words, to shew <HI>Alcinous,</HI> by a secret denial, that
he could not be induc'd to stay from his country, or marry
his daughter: He calls <HI>Circe</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, because she is skill'd
in magical Incantations: He describes <HI>Ithaca</HI> with all its incon∣veniencies,
to convince <HI>Alcinous</HI> of his veracity,, and that he
will not deceive him in other circumstances, when he gives so
disadvantagious a character of a country for which he expresses
so great a fondness; and lastly, in relating the death of his friends,
he seems to be guilty of a tautology, in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But
<HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> gives us the reason of it, <HI>Atrocitatem rei bis idem
dicendo auxit, inculcavitque, non igitur illa ejusdem significationis re∣petitio,
ignava &amp; frigida videri debet.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 41. <HI>—To the</HI> Cicons' <HI>shore.</HI> Here is the na∣tural
and true beginning of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> which comprehends all
the sufferings of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and these sufferings take their date im∣mediately
after his leaving the shores of <HI>Troy;</HI> from that moment
he endeavours to return to his own country, and all the difficul∣ties
he meets with in returning, enter into the subject of the Po∣em.
But it may then be ask'd, if the <HI>Odyssey</HI> does not take up
the space of ten years, since <HI>Ulysses</HI> wastes so many in his return;
and is not this contrary to the nature of Epic Poetry, which is
agreed must not at the longest exceed the duration of one year,
or rather Campaign? The answer is, the Poet lets all the time
pass which exceeds the bounds of Epic action, before he opens
the Poem; thus <HI>Ulysses</HI> spends some time before he arrives at the
Island of <HI>Circe,</HI> with her he continues one year, and seven with
<HI>Calypso;</HI> he begins artificially at the conclusion of the action, and
finds an opportunity to repeat the most considerable and neces∣sary
<PB N="313" REF="286"/>
incidents which preceded the opening of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> by
this method he reduces the duration of it into less compass than
the space of two months. This conduct is absolutely necessary,
for from the time that the Poet introduces, his Heroe upon the
stage, he ought to continue his action to the very end of it, that
he may never afterwards appear idle or out of motion: This is veri∣fied
in <HI>Ulysses;</HI> from the moment he leaves the Island <HI>Ogygia</HI> to the
death of the Suitors, he is never out of view, never idle; he is always
either in action, or preparing for it, 'till he is re-establish'd in his
dominions. If the Poet had follow'd the natural order of the
action, he, like <HI>Lucan,</HI> would hot have wrote an Epic Poem, but
an History in verse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 44. <HI>And sack'd the city</HI>—] The Poet assigns no

<DIV2 N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 69. <HI>Six brave companions from each ship we lost.</HI>] This
is one of the passages which fell under the censure of <HI>Zoilus;</HI> it
is very improbable, says that Critic, that each vessel should lose
six men exactly, this seems a too equal distribution to be true,
considering the chance of battle. But it has been answer'd, that
<HI>Ulysses</HI> had twelve vessels, and that in this engagement he lost se∣venty
two soldiers; so that the meaning is, that taking the total
of his loss, and dividing it equally thro' the whole fleet, he found
<PB N="314" REF="287"/>
it amounted exactly to six men in every vessel. This will ap∣pear
to be a true solution, if we remember that there was a
necessity to supply the loss of any one ship out of the others that
had suffer'd less; so that tho' one vessel lost more than the rest,
yet being recruited equally from the rest of the fleet, there would
be exactly six men wanting in every vessel. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 74. <HI>And thrice we call'd on each unhappy Shade.</HI>] This
passage preserves a piece of Antiquity: It was the custom of the
<HI>Grecians,</HI> when their friends dy'd upon foreign shores, to use
this ceremony of recalling their souls, tho' they obtain'd not
their bodies; believing by this method, that they transported them
to their own country: <HI>Pindar</HI> mentions the same practice,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
That is, “<HI>Phrixus</HI> commands thee to call his soul into his own
country.” Thus the <HI>Athenians</HI> when they lost any men at sea,
went to the shores and calling thrice on their names, rais'd a Ce∣notaph
or empty monument to their memories; by performing
which solemnity, they invited the shades of the departed to re∣turn,
and perform'd all rites as if the bodies of the dead had re∣ally
been buried by them in their Sepulchres. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> as well as the <HI>Greeks</HI> follow'd the same custom: thus <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>—Et magnâ Manes ter voce vocavi.</Q>
The occasion of this practice arose from the opinion, that the
souls of the departed were not admitted into the state of the hap∣py,
without the performance of the sepulchral solemnities.</P>

<Q><L>VERSE 95. <HI>The tenth we touch'd</HI>—</L>
<L><HI>The land of</HI> Lotos—]</L></Q>
<P>This passage has given occasion for much controversy; for since
the <HI>Lotophagi</HI> in reality are distant from the <HI>Malean</HI> Cape twenty
two thousand five hundred stades, <HI>Ulysses</HI> must sail above two
thousand every day, if in nine days he sail'd to the <HI>Lotophagi.</HI>
This objection would be unanswerable, if we place that nation in
the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean, but <HI>Dacier</HI> observes from <HI>Strabo,</HI> that <HI>Polybius</HI>
examin'd this point, and thus gives us the result of it. This great
Historian maintains, that <HI>Homer</HI> has not placed the <HI>Lotophagi</HI> in
the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean, as he does the Islands of <HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Calypso,</HI>
because it was improbable that in the compass of ten days the
most favourable winds could have carry'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> from the <HI>Male∣an</HI>
Cape into that Ocean; it therefore follows, that the Poet has
given us the true situation of this nation, conformably to Geo∣graphy,
and placed it as it really lies in the Mediterranean; now
in ten days a good wind will carry a vessel from <HI>Malea</HI> into the
Mediterranean, as <HI>Homer</HI> relates.</P>
<P>This is an instance that <HI>Homer</HI> sometimes follows truth without
fiction, at other times disguises it. But I confess I think <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Poetry would have been as beautiful if he had describ'd all his
Islands in their true positions: His inconstancy in this point, may
seem to introduce confusion and ambiguity, when the truth
would have been more clear, and as beautiful in his Poetry.</P>
<P>Nothing can better shew the great deference which former ages
pay'd <HI>Homer,</HI> than these defences of the learned Ancients;
they continually ascribe his deviations from truth, (as in the in∣stance
before us) to design, not to ignorance; to his art as a Poet,
and not to want of skill as a Geographer. In a writer of less
fame, such relations might be thought errors, but in <HI>Homer</HI> they
are either understood to be no errors, or if errors, they are vin∣dicated

<P>VERSE 106. Lotos.] <HI>Eustathius</HI> assures us, that there are
various kinds of it. It has been a question whether it is a herb,
a root, or a tree: He is of opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> speaks of it as an
herb; for he calls it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is in its proper sense apply'd to the grazing of beasts, and
therefore he judges it not to be a tree, or root. He adds,
there is an <HI>Aegyptian Lotos,</HI> which as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms, grows
in great abundance along the <HI>Nile</HI> in the time of its inun∣dations;
it resembles (says that Historian in his <HI>Euterpe</HI>) a
Lilly, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> dry it in the sun, then take the pulp out
of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it as bread;
this kind of it agrees likewise with the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of <HI>Homer.
Athenaeus</HI> writes of the <HI>Libyan Lotos</HI> in the 14th book of
his <HI>Deipnosophist;</HI> he quotes the words of <HI>Polybius</HI> in the 12th
book of his History, now not extant; that Historian speaks of it
as an eye-witness, having examin'd the nature of it. “The <HI>Lotos</HI>
is a tree of no great height, rough and thorny: it bears a green
leaf, somewhat thicker and broader than that of the bramble or
briar; its fruit at first is like the ripe berries of the myrtle, both
in size and colour, but when it ripens it turns to purple; it is
then about the bigness of an olive, it is round, and contains a
very small kernel; when it is ripe they gather it, and bruising it
among bread-corn, they put it up into a vessel, and keep it as
food for their slaves; they dress it after the same manner for their
other domestics, but first take out the kernel from it: It has the
taste of a fig, or dates, but is of a far better smell: They like∣wise
make a wine of it, by steeping and bruising it in water; it
<PB N="317" REF="290"/>
has a very agreeable taste, like wine temper'd with honey. They
drink it without mixing it with water, but it will not keep above
ten days, they therefore make it only in small quantities for immedi∣ate
use.” Perhaps it was this last kind of <HI>Lotos,</HI> which the com∣panions
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> tasted; and if it was thus prepar'd, it gives a
reason why they were overcome with it; for being a wine, it had
the power of intoxication.</P>

a ship may easily sail in one day from the land of the <HI>Lotophagi</HI>
to <HI>Sicily:</HI> These <HI>Cyclops</HI> inhabited the western part of that Island,
about <HI>Drepane</HI> and <HI>Lilybaeaum. Bochart</HI> shews us, that they derive
their name from the place of their habitation; for the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
call them <HI>Chek-lub,</HI> by contraction for <HI>Chek-lelub;</HI> that is, the gulph
of <HI>Lilybaeum,</HI> or the men who dwell about the <HI>Lilybaean</HI> gulph.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> (who understood not the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> language) form'd
the word <HI>Cyclop,</HI> from <HI>Chek-lub,</HI> from the affinity of sound; which
word in the <HI>Greek</HI> language, signifying a circular eye, might give
occasion to fable that they had but one large round eye in the
middle of their foreheads. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> tells us that the eye of <HI>Cyclops</HI> is an allegory, to re∣present
that in anger, or any other violent passion, men see but
one single object as that passion directs, or see but with one
eye: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and that passion transforms us
into a kind of savages, and makes us brutal and sanguinary, like
this <HI>Polypheme;</HI> and he that by reason extinguishes such a passion,
may like <HI>Ulysses</HI> be said to put out that eye that made him see
but one single object.</P>
<P>I have already given another reason of this fiction; namely
their wearing a headpiece, or martial Vizor that had but one sight
thro' it. The vulgar form their judgments from appearances;
and a mariner who pass'd these coasts at a distance, observing
the resemblance of a broad eye in the forehead of one of these
<HI>Cyclops,</HI> might relate it accordingly, and impose it as a truth
upon the credulity of the ignorant: it is notorious that things
equally monstrous have found belief in all ages.</P>
<P>But it may be ask'd if there were any such persons who bore
the name of <HI>Cyclops?</HI> No less an Historian than <HI>Thucydides</HI> in∣forsm
<PB N="319" REF="292"/>
forms us, that <HI>Sicily</HI> was at first possess'd and inhabited by Giants,
by the <HI>Laestrigons</HI> and <HI>Cyclops,</HI> a barbarous and inhuman people:
But he adds, that these savages dwelt only in one part of that
Island.</P>
<P><HI>Cedrenus</HI> gives an exact, description of the <HI>Cyclops:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
“<HI>Ulysses</HI> fell among the <HI>Cyclops</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> a people not one∣ey'd
according to the Mythologists, but men like other men,
only of a more gigantic stature, and of a barbarous and savage
temper.” From this description, we may see what <HI>Homer</HI> writes
as a Poet, and what as an Historian; he paints these people in ge∣neral
agreeably to their persons, only disguises some features, to
give an ornament to his relation, and to introduce the Marvel∣lous,
which demands a place chiefly in Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>What <HI>Homer</HI> speaks of the fertility of <HI>Sicily,</HI> is agreeable to Hi∣story:
It was call'd anciently <HI>Romani Imperii Horreum. Pliny,</HI> lib. 10.
cap. 10. writes, that the <HI>Leontine</HI> plains bear for every grain of
corn, an hundred. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> relates in his History what <HI>Homer</HI>
speaks in Poetry, that the fields of <HI>Leontium</HI> yield wheat without
the culture of the husbandman; he was an eye-witness, being
a native of the Island. From hence in general it may be observ'd,
that where-ever we can trace <HI>Homer,</HI> we find, if not historic truth,
yet the resemblance of it; that is, as plain truth as can be related
without converting his Poem into an History.</P>

<P><HI>Dacier</HI> adds from <HI>Plato,</HI> that after the Deluge, three manners
of life succeeded among mankind; the first was rude and savage;
men were afraid of a second flood, and therefore inhabited the
summits of mountains, without any dependance upon one ano∣ther,
and each was absolute in his own family: The second was
less brutal; as the fear of the Deluge wore away by degrees, they
descended toward the bottom of mountains, and began to have some
intercourse: The third was more polish'd; when a full security from
the apprehensions of a flood was establish'd by time, they then
began to inhabit the plains, and a more general commerce by de∣grees
prevailing, they enter'd into societies, and establish'd laws for
the general good of the whole community. These <HI>Cyclopeans</HI> main∣tain'd
the first state of life in the days of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> they had no in∣tercourse
with other societies, by reason of their barbarities, and
consequently their manners were not at all polish'd by the gene∣ral
laws of humanity. This account agrees excellently with
the holy Scriptures, and perhaps <HI>Plato</HI> borrow'd it from the wri∣tings
of <HI>Moses;</HI> after the Deluge men retreated to mountains for
fear of a second flood; their chief riches, like these <HI>Cyclopeans,</HI> con∣sisted

<HI>Latin</HI> Poets. Thus <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q><L>Tum pater omnipotens faecundis imbribus Aether</L>
<L>Conjugis in gremium laetae descendit—</L></Q>
and consequently the herbs and plants being nourish'd by the mild
air and fruitful rains, may be said to be the daughters of <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
or off-spring of the skies; and these goats and beasts of the field be∣ing
fed by these plants and herbs may be said to be awaken'd by
the daughters of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that is, they awake to feed upon the her∣bage
early in the morning. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Thus <HI>Homer</HI> makes
Deities of the vegetative faculties and virtues of the field. I fear
such boldnesses would not be allow'd in modern Poetry.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd that this interpretation is very refin'd: But
I am sure it will be a more natural explication to take these for
the real mountain Nymphs <HI>(Oreades)</HI> as they are in many places
of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> the very expression is found in the sixth book,
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</Q>

<P>A very sufficient reason may be assign'd, why <HI>Ulysses</HI> here goes

<P>VERSE 221. <HI>A form enormous! far unlike the race of human birth.
Goropius Becanus,</HI> an <HI>Antwerpian,</HI> has wrote a large discourse to
prove, that there never were any such men as Giants; contrary
to the testimony both of prophane and sacred History: Thus
<HI>Moses</HI> speaks of the <HI>Rephaims</HI> of <HI>Asteroth,</HI> the <HI>Zamzummims</HI> of
<HI>Ham,</HI> the <HI>Enims</HI> of <HI>Moab,</HI> and <HI>Anakims</HI> of <HI>Hebron.</HI> See <HI>Deut.</HI> ii.
ver. 20. “That also was call'd a land of Giants, it was a great
people, and tall as the <HI>Zamzummims.</HI>” Thus <HI>Goliath</HI> must be al∣low'd
to be a Giant, for he was six cubits and a span, that is,
nine feet and a span in height; his coat of mail weigh'd five
thousand shekels of brass, about one hundred and fifty
<PB N="324" REF="297"/>
pounds; (but I confess others understand the lesser Shekel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)
the head of his spear alone weigh'd six hundred shekels of
iron, that is about eighteen or nineteen pounds. We find
the like relations in prophane History: <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his life
of <HI>Theseus</HI> says, that age was productive of men of pro∣digious
stature, Giants. Thus <HI>Diodorus Siculus; Aegyptii scri∣bunt,
Isidis aetate, fuisse vasto corpore homines, quos Graeci dix∣ere
Gigantes. Herodotus</HI> affirms that the body of <HI>Orestes</HI> was
dug up, and appear'd to be seven cubits long; but <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI>
believes this to be an error. <HI>Josephus</HI> writes, <HI>l.</HI> 18. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. that
<HI>Vitellius</HI> sent a <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Eleazar,</HI> seven cubits in height, as a
present from <HI>Artabanus</HI> King of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> to <HI>Tiberius Caesar;</HI>
this man was ten feet and a half high. <HI>Pliny,</HI> 7. 16. speaks
of a man that was nine feet nine inches high; and in another
place, 6. 30. <HI>Sybortas, gentem Aethiopum Nomadum, octona cubi∣ta
longitudine excedere.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is evident, that there have been men of very extraor∣dinary
stature in former ages. Tho' perhaps such instances were
not frequent in any age or any nation. So that <HI>Homer</HI>
only amplifies, not invents; and as there was really a people call'd
<HI>Cyclopeans,</HI> so they might be men of great stature, or giants.</P>
<P>It may seem strange that in all ancient stories the first
planters of most nations are recorded to be Giants; I scarce
can persuade my self but such accounts are generally fabu∣lous;
and hope to be pardon'd for a conjecture which may
give a seeming reason how such stories came to prevail. The
<HI>Greeks</HI> were a people of very great antiquity; they made many
expeditions, as appears from <HI>Jason, &amp;c.</HI> and sent out frequent
Colonies: Now the head of every Colony was call'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and these
adventurers being persons of great figure in story, were recorded
as men of war, of might and renown, thro' the old world:
It is therefore not impossible but the <HI>Hebrews</HI> might form their,
word <HI>Anac,</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and use it to denote persons
of uncommon might and abilities. These they call'd <HI>Anac,</HI> and sons
of <HI>Anac;</HI> and afterwards in a less proper sense used it to signify
men of uncommon stature, or giants. So that in this sense, all
<PB N="325" REF="298"/>

expose them to so imminent danger. If he had made the choice
himself, they whom he had chosen might have thought he had
<PB N="328" REF="301"/>
given them up to destruction, and they whom he had rejected
might have judg'd it a stain upon them as a want of merit, and
so have complain'd of injustice; but by this method he avoids
these inconveniencies.</P>

<P>VERSE 399. <HI>—Or so some God design'd.</HI>] <HI>Ulysses</HI> ascribes it to
the influence of the Gods, that <HI>Polypheme</HI> drives the whole flock
into his den, and does not separate the females from the males as
he had before done; for by this accident <HI>Ulysses</HI> makes his escape,
as appears from the following part of the story. <HI>Homer</HI> here
uses the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to shew the suspicion which <HI>Polypheme</HI>
might entertain that <HI>Ulysses</HI> had other companions abroad who
might plunder his flocks; and this gives another reason why he
drove them all into his cave, namely for the greater security.</P>

<P>VERSE 432.—Noman <HI>is my name.</HI>] I will not trouble
the Reader with a long account of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to be found in <HI>Eustathius,</HI>
who seems delighted with this piece of pleasantry; nor with what
<HI>Dacier</HI> observes, who declares she approves of it extreamly, and
calls it a very happy imagination. If it were modesty in me to
dissent from <HI>Homer,</HI> and two Commentators, I would own my
opinion of it, and acknowledge the whole to be nothing
but a collusion of words, and fitter to have place in a Farce
or Comedy, than in Epic Poetry. <HI>Lucian</HI> has thus used it,
and apply'd it to raise laughter in one of his facetious dialogues.
The whole wit or jest lies in the ambiguity of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which <HI>Ulys∣ses</HI>
imposes upon <HI>Polypheme</HI> as his own name, which in reality
signifies <HI>No Man.</HI> I doubt not but <HI>Homer</HI> was well pleased with it,
for afterwards he plays upon the word, and calls <HI>Ulysses</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
But the faults of <HI>Homer</HI> have a kind of veneration, per∣haps
like old age, from their antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="302"/>
<HI>Euripides</HI> has translated this whole passage in his Tragedy, call'd
the <HI>Cyclops.</HI> The Chorus begins thus, <HI>Why dost thou thus cry out,</HI>
Cyclops? Cyc. <HI>I am undone.</HI> Cho. <HI>You seem to be in a woful
condition.</HI> Cyc. <HI>I am utterly miserable.</HI> Cho. <HI>You have been drunk

<HI>Well then</HI> No man <HI>has injur'd you.</HI> Cyc. Noman <HI>has blinded me.</HI>

<P>This appears to me more fit for the two <HI>Sofia's</HI> in <HI>Plau∣tus,</HI>

should introduce such a sport of words upon the stage, even in
the Comedy of our days, would meet with small applause.</P>

<P>VERSE 458. <HI>Who plye the wimble.</HI>] This and the following
comparison are drawn from low life, but enobled with a dig∣nity
of expression. Instead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Aristarchus</HI> reads <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
as <HI>Eustathius</HI> informs us. The similitudes are natural and lively,
we are made spectators of what they represent. <HI>Sophocles</HI> has
imitated this, in the Tragedy where <HI>OEdipus</HI> tears out his own eyes;
and <HI>Euripides</HI> has transferr'd this whole adventure into his <HI>Cyclops</HI>
with very little alteration, and in particular the former comparison.
But to instance in all that <HI>Euripides</HI> has imitated, would be to
transcribe a great part of that Tragedy. In short, this Episode
in general is very noble, but if the Interlude about <HI>Outis</HI> be at
all allowable in so grave and majestic a Poem, it is only allow∣able
because it is here related before a light and injudicious assem∣bly,
I mean the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> to whom any thing more great or
serious would have been less pleasing, so that the Poet writes to
his audience. I wonder this has never been offer'd in defence of

<P>VERSE 495.—<HI>The stone removing from the gate.</HI>] This
conduct of <HI>Polypheme</HI> may seem very absurd, and it looks to be
improbable that he should not call the other Giants to assist him,
in the detection of the persons who had taken his sight from
him; especially when it was now day-light, and they at hand.
<HI>Eustathius</HI> was aware of the objection, and imputes it to his folly
and dullness. <HI>Tully,</HI> 5. <HI>Tuscul.</HI> gives the same character of <HI>Poly∣pheme;</HI>
and because it vindicates <HI>Homer</HI> for introducing a speech
of <HI>Polypheme</HI> to his Ram, I will beg leave to transcribe it. <HI>Ti∣resiam,</HI>

mistaken the words of <HI>Polypheme</HI> to the Ram, for there is no
resemblance to <HI>ejus laudare fortunas, quod quà velles ingredi posset,

<P>VERSE 511. <HI>One ram remain'd, the leader of the flock.</HI>] This passage has been mis-understood, to imply that <HI>Ulysses</HI> took
more care of himself than of his companions, in chusing the
largest ram for his own convenience; an imputation unworthy
of the character of an Heroe. But there is no ground for it, he
takes more care of his friends than of his own person, for he al∣lots
them three sheep, and lets them escape before him. Besides
this conduct was necessary; for all his friends were bound, and
by chusing this ram, he keeps himself at liberty to unbind the
rest after their escape. Neither was there any other method practi∣cable;
for he being the last, there was no person to bind him.

<P>But it may seem improbable that a Ram should be able to carry
so great a burthen as <HI>Ulysses;</HI> the generation of sheep, as well as
men, may appear to have decreas'd since the days of <HI>Ulysses. Ho∣mer</HI>

these sheep as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; the Ram is spo∣ken
of as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (an expression apply'd to <HI>Ajax,</HI> as <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>
observes, in the <HI>Iliad.</HI>) History informs us of sheep of a
very large size in other countries, and a Poet is at liberty to chuse
the largest, if by that method he gives his story a greater appear∣ance
of probability.</P>

<P>This particularity may seem of no importance, and consequent∣ly
unnecessary: but it is in Poetry as in Painting; they both

<P>VERSE 569. <HI>It almost brush'd the helm,</HI> &amp;c.] The An∣cients,
remarks <HI>Eustathius,</HI> placed an Obelisk and Asterism be∣fore
this verse; the former, to note that they thought it mis-placed;
the latter, to shew that they look'd upon it as a beauty. Appa∣rently
it is not agreeable to the description; for how is it possi∣ble
that this huge rock, falling <HI>before</HI> the vessel should endanger
<PB N="332" REF="305"/>
the rudder, which is in the stern? Can a ship sail with the stern
foremost? Some ancient Criticks to take away the contradiction,
have asserted that <HI>Ulysses</HI> turn'd his ship to speak to <HI>Polypheme;</HI>
but this is absurd, for why could not <HI>Ulysses</HI> speak from the stern
as well as from the prow? It therefore seems that the verse ought
to be entirely omitted, as undoubtedly it may without any chasm
in the Author. We find it inserted a little lower, and there it
corresponds with the description, and stands with propriety.</P>
<P>But if we suppose that the ship of <HI>Ulysses</HI> lay at such a distance
from the cave of <HI>Polypheme,</HI> as to make it necessary to bring it
nearer, to be heard distinctly; then indeed we may solve the dif∣ficulty,
and let the verse stand; for if we suppose <HI>Ulysses</HI> ap∣proaching
toward <HI>Polypheme,</HI> then the rock may be said to be
thrown before the vessel, that is, beyond it, and endanger the
rudder, and this bears some appearance of probability.</P>

<P>If <HI>Polypheme</HI> had really this quality of running upon the waves,
he might have destroy'd <HI>Ulysses</HI> without throwing this mountain;
but <HI>Apollonius</HI> is undoubtedly guilty of an absurdity, and one
might rather believe that he would sink the earth at every step,
than run upon the waters with such lightness as not to wet his
feet. <HI>Virgil</HI> has more judiciously apply'd those lines to <HI>Camilla</HI> in

<P>VERSE 595. <HI>This,</HI> Telemus Eurymedes <HI>foretold.</HI>] This inci∣dent

had destroy'd him as his most dangerous enemy. <HI>Plutarch</HI>
in his discourse upon Garrulity, commends the fidelity of the com∣panions
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who when they were dragg'd by this Giant
and dash'd against the rock, confess'd not a word concerning their
Lord, and scorn'd to purchase their lives at the expence of their
honesty. <HI>Ulysses</HI> himself, adds he, was the most <HI>eloquent</HI> and most
<HI>silent</HI> of men; he knew that a word spoken never wrought so
much good, as a word conceal'd; Men teach us to speak, but the
Gods teach us silence; for silence is the first thing that is taught
us at our initiation into sacred mysteries; and we find these
companions had profited under so great a Master in silence as <HI>Ulysses.</HI></P>

in compliance with the character of a Giant; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> won∣der'd
at the manly stature of <HI>Ulysses, Polypheme</HI> speaks of him as a
dwarf; his rage undoubtedly made him treat him with so much
contempt. Nothing in nature can be better imagin'd than this
story or the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> if we consider the assembly before which it
was spoken, I mean die <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> who had been driven from their
habitation by the <HI>Cyclopeans,</HI> as appears from the sixth of the <HI>O∣dyssey,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="307"/>
and compell'd to make a new settlement in their present

brings this very circumstance as an argument to induce them to
it. O Neptune, <HI>says the</HI> Cyclop, <HI>destroy</HI> Ulysses, <HI>or if he be fated
to return, may it be in a vessel not of his own!</HI> Here he plainly tells
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> that the prayer of <HI>Cyclops</HI> was almost accomplish'd,
for his own ships were destroy'd by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and now he was
ready to sail in a foreign vessel; by which the whole prayer would
be compleated. By this he persuades them, that they were the peo∣ple

<P>VERSE 642. <HI>The master Ram was voted mine.</HI>] This perhaps might
be a present of honour and distinction: But I should rather take it
with <HI>Eustathius</HI> to be the Ram which brought <HI>Ulysses</HI> out of the den
of <HI>Polypheme.</HI> That Heroe immediately offers it in sacrifice to <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI>
in gratitude for his deliverance; an instance of piety to be
imitated in more enlighten'd ages.</P>
<P>The book concludes with a testimony of this Heroe's huma∣nity;
in the midst of the joy for his own safety, his generous
heart finds room for a tender sentiment for the loss of his
companions; both his joys and his sorrows are commendable and
virtuous.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd this Episode of <HI>Polyphemus,</HI> and inserted it
into the third of the <HI>Aeneis.</HI> I will not presume to decide which
<PB N="335" REF="308"/>
Author has the greatest success, they both have their pecu∣liar
excellencies. <HI>Rapine</HI> confesses this Episode to be equal to
any parts of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> that it is an original, and that <HI>Homer</HI> intro∣duced
that monstrous character, to shew the Marvellous, and paint
it in a new set of colours. <HI>Demetrius Phalereus</HI> calls it a piece of
Sublime strangely horrible: and <HI>Longinus,</HI> even while he is con∣demning
the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> allows this adventure of <HI>Polypheme</HI> to be ve∣ry
great and beautiful; (for so Monsieur <HI>Boileau</HI> understands <HI>Lon∣ginus,</HI>
tho' Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> differs from his judgment.) In <HI>Homer</HI>
we find a greater variety of natural incidents than in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but
in <HI>Virgil</HI> a greater pomp of verse: <HI>Homer</HI> is not uniform in his
description, but sometimes stoops perhaps below the dignity of
Epic Poetry; <HI>Virgil</HI> walks along with an even, grave, and ma∣jestic
pace: They both raise our admiration, mix'd with delight
and terror.</P>
