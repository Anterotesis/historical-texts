<P>I Presume to approach you without the cere∣mony of a formal introduction: if my intru∣sion is impertinent, you will punish it by neglect.</P>
<P>IN prefixing your name to my performance, I disclaim all sordid motives. I address myself, not to the minister, but to the patriot. What I offer is not a sacrifice to interest; but a tribute due to superior merit. Power and office are adventitious and transitory. They are often vested in the wicked and the worthless. They perpetually fluc∣tuate between accident and caprice. To-day, you stand conspicuous at the helm of state: to∣morrow, you may repose yourself in the shade of private virtue. My veneration is attached to per∣manent qualities: qualities that exist independent
<PB REF="40"/>
of favour or of faction: qualities which you can neither forfeit nor resign. I respect those shining talents by which you have distinguished yourself above all your cotemporaries. I revere that inte∣grity which you have maintained in the midst of corruption. I appeal to you as a consummate judge of literary merit; as an undaunted assertor of British liberty; as a steady legislator intimately acquainted with the constitution of your country, which you have so nobly defended from incroach∣ment and violation.</P>
<P>SHOULD the History I now present, have the good fortune to acquire your approbation, I shall bear, without repining, the insults I may sustain from the virulence of malignant censure. Should it be found altogether unworthy of your notice and regard, it will naturally sink into oblivion. What∣ever may be its fate with you, or with the public, I gladly seize this opportunity to declare that I am, with the most perfect esteem and admiration,</P>

<HEAD>PLAN OF THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>SO many Histories of England have already appeared, that the editor of this performance finds it absolutely necessary to make the Public acquainted with the motives which have induced him to usher into the world another work on the same subject.</P>
<P>The author does not pretend to have discovered any authentic records which have escaped the notice of other historians; or to have thrown such lights upon particular facts, as must alter the received opinions of mankind, touching the material circumstances of the narration. His aim is to retrench the superfluities of his predecessors, and to present the Public with a succinct, candid, and complete History of our own coun∣try, which will be more easy in the purchase, more agreeable in the perusal, and less burthensome to the memory, than any work of the same nature, produced in these kingdoms.</P>
<P>By the enormous bulk and prolixity of every other English history that stands in any degree of reputation, many readers have been deterred from learning what every person ought to know, and even totally dis∣couraged from engaging in the most entertaining and useful of all ra∣tional inquiries.</P>
<P><PB REF="60"/>
The author has avoided all useless disquisitions, which serve only to swell the size of the volume, interrupt the thread of the narrative, and perplex the reader. His purpose was to compile an history, not to compose a dissertation.</P>
<P>He has waved all remarks of his own, except such as seemed ab∣solutely necessary, that he might not encumber the page, and disgust the reader, by anticipating his reflection, and forestalling his judgment.</P>
<P>He has forborn to record foreign incidents in which England has no immediate concern; as the design is not to publish the annals of Europe, but the transactions of one people. Neither has he literally transcribed every treaty of alliance, and each single decree of parliament, so as to form a monstrous medley of the highest enterprizes of power, and the lowliest precautions of civil oeconomy. Such a work would be a dry, tedious, fatiguing collection of public acts and statutes, rather than a well connected detail of historical events.</P>
<P>He has been upon his guard against that affectation of singularity, which is so apt to betray an author into a labyrinth of vague conjectures, through which the truth often vanishes from his researches.</P>
<P>He values himself upon being entirely free from all national jealousy and prejudice; and altogether uninfluenced by that illiberal partiality which has disgraced the works of many English historians. He is soured by no controversy in religion: he is inflamed by no faction in politics. Truth is the object of his inquiry; and candid information the scope of his labour.</P>
<P>He pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tends to communicate a summary idea of the antient inhabi∣tants of this island, as described by Greek and Latin authors, the only fources from which we can draw any certain intelligence concerning the original possessors of Britain.</P>
<P><PB REF="70"/>
After a di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinct detail of Caesar's de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cent, the progress of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arms in England under successive emperors, the formation of the pro∣vince, their improvements in the civil policy of the country, the gra∣dual declension of their power, and their final retreat to the continent; he proceeds to describe the first dawnings of the christian fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the arrival, settlement, character, and genius of the Saxon adventur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and progress of our constitution in church and state; and the changes it underwent in consequence of the Norman conquest.</P>
<P>He mentions every material transaction, whether of war or of peace, whether public or private, which might conduce to the illustration of the subject.</P>
<P>He collects hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> materials from the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthentic his<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orians, to whose works he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refers in the margin. He delineates the characters of princes, from the uniform tenour of their public conduct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pared with strik∣ing passages in private life, which often exhibit the real, naked picture, uncloaked with reserve, undisguised by formality or dissimulation.</P>
<P>He records every remarkable improvement in arts and sciences, which the world has owed to the natives of this kingdom.</P>
<P>He exhibits a separate view of ecclesiastical affairs, digested into distinct periods, from the first preaching of Christianity in Britain, to the latest regulations of church-government.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to write in a clear, succinct, nervous stile; to ar∣range his materials with accuracy and precision; to expatiate on the most interesting circumstances; and to entertain the imagination, while he informs the understanding.</P>
<P>In order to assist the memory, and supply proper pauses for the at∣tention, he has planned the work into a certain number of books or parts, each comprehending the transactions of one important period;
<PB REF="80"/>
and these are subdivided into chapters, furnished with titular contents, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t distinguish every individual section or paragraph.</P>
<P>The chronology is ascertained from year to year, on the margin.</P>
<P>All ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cure allusions are explained in notes at the bottom of the page; together with the genealogical deduction of every prince's posterity and marriages, reputed portents, detached events, and private an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cdotes: which, though tending to elucidate the story, would, if inserted in the context, disunite the chain of incidents, and spoil the uniformity of the execution.</P>
<P>On the whole, this work is formed upon a plan which was the result of the most mature deliberation; and has one advantage over all other histories of England; namely, that of being brought home to our own times and observation, from the earliest age of our historical credit to the last treaty of Aix la Chapelle.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE first and most important effort of human genius appears to have been the art of transmitting and perpetuating ideas; and this shines in nothing more conspicuous than in the labours of historians, which not only present us with a review of all those mighty events which influ∣enced the fate of nations, but also communicate to our inquiry the whole pro∣gress of improvement, the whole circle of knowlege and experience. In this delightful study we become acquainted with the characters and even the persons of those heroes who triumphed over barbarity, of those legislators who strength∣ened the bands of society, and of those philosophers who instructed, polished and reformed mankind. The faculties of the mind are opened and enlarged in the contemplation of such an expanded field: the humane passions are interested in the fortune of the remotest nations, because humanity is every where the same; and, howsoever divided by mountains, rivers and seas, severed by policy, dis∣persed by accident, or distinguished by a difference of laws, language, climate, or complexion, we are all the children of one parent; all the brethren of one
<PB N="2" REF="110"/>
family. The understanding unfolds and ripens in proportion to the exercise it un∣dergoes; the memory retains, the reflection profits by the example, and the heart glows with a laudable e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ulation to rival the practice of recorde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> virtue.</P>
<P>Of all the dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts in this w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e extended field, no province exhibits more illus∣trious scenes and characters; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>story a richer fund of entertainment and in∣struction, than that of Britain, which we now purpose to display: and surely no subject can merit our attention so much, no theme so warmly engage our hearts, as that which treats of our own country; as that which expatiates upon inci∣dents relating to those very ancestors from whom we ourselves are immediately derived. Yet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how interesting soever the subject may be, the task is not to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rformed wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> difficulty and even disgust, arising from the obseurity that vei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igin of this as well as of all other n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, and the perplexed though elabo∣rate discussions of those who have fondly endeavoured, by wild conjectures, to trace it backwards into the shades of ignorance and allegory of fable.</P>
<P>Among other uncertainties, nothing seems to have puzzled those search∣ers into antiquity more than the name of the island, which has been variously pronounced by various nations, according to the particular genius and termina∣tion of every respective, language.</P>

the universal deluge, or some other violent shock of nature. This notion hath been espoused by many auti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors, ancient as well as modern; and one writer in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verstegan.</NOTE> particular, endeavours to support the conj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture, by observing that the appella∣tion of Cliffs given to the rocks on both sides of the channel, seem to imply their having been cleft asunder; that the extent of these rocks is exactly the same on each side, fronting one another; that they have the same appearance, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing per∣pendicular and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bropt from the shore, unlike the gradual ascent of the hills and mountains on other co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts, that generally slope towards the adjoining vallies; and that a ridge of rock runs across the streights at the bottom of the sea. To t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se observations we may add, that Holland, Zealand, and the lower parts of F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anders plainly appear to have been once covered with the sea, which would naturally leave them dry on finding such a passage; and that the setting of two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid.

<P>Such a separation (if it really happened) was an advantage to Great Britain, inasmuch as it formed a noble barrier to defend this island from the insuits, intrigues, and invasions of its neighbours, of whom it was in other respects al∣together independent: for, it produces all the necessaries and comforts of life: the soil is fruitful, the air, though moist, not unhealthy: it abounds with cattle, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imber, minerals and metals; the windings and indentations of the coast afford numberless bays, creeks and harbours for the security of shipping, and the surrounding sea teems with myriads of fish for food and exportation. Here the summer is not scorching, nor the winter severe; the heat is tempered with cooling breezes, the frost is tamed by the warmth of the sea; the ground is cloathed with a perpetual verdure; and the country diversified with hill and dale, so as to exhibit a variety of enchanting prospects to the view.</P>

<P>All these natural advantages could not fail to attract the notice of those who wandered about in quest of habitations, and we find it was peopled long be∣fore mankind had invented the art of transmitting events to posterity; for, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scrabo.

Of these the Phoenicians seem first to have discovered the western extremities of the island, from whence they ex∣ported tin and other commodities: and considered this traffic as a matter of such consequence, that they erected a number of forts or castles in that province which is now called Cornwall, for the protection of the traders, and the preser∣vation of that commerce <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eg, part of Cornwall, is of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enician derivation, and signifies Bounded by the sea: in this peninsula is a heap of stones on the banks of a lake called Erth or Arith, which is the Phoenician word for lake: the famous hill Go∣dolian implies plenty of metal, in the same lan∣guage; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enn, a hill, comes from the Phoenician Penna, and Tra, from Tera, signifying a castle.

<P>Nay, so jealous were they of this advantage, that they concealed the voyage from all the rest of the world; and when one of their ships was followed by a Ro∣man vessel, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted out in order to discover her destination, the Phoenician pilot ran <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strab. lib. 3.</NOTE>

the bark ashore, that the Romans might be disappointed in their aim; and at his return was indemnified out of the public treasury.</P>
<P>The British isles, including those of Scilly, called by the Greeks Cassiterides, were discovered by the Phoenicians about four hundred and fifty years before the birth of Christ; and a trade to these parts was opened by the Carthaginians, who, about the year of Rome three hundred and seven, sent Hanno and Hamil∣car with two fleets to sea, north and south from the streights of Gibraltar, with a view to discover the western coasts of Africa and Europe, with the islands that lay in the Atlantic ocean. Hamilcar, who was charged with the northern voyage, having coasted along Spain and Gaul, discovered the island of Great Britain; and sailing up the channel, penetrated into the German ocean as far as the Bal∣tic. Long before this period, however, Britain was peopled from the conti∣nent; and almost all authors, who have treated on this subject, agree that the first inhabitants ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their origin to the Celtae or Gauls that settled on the oppo∣site shore. A supposition founded upon the evident conformity between them in the circumstances of laws, religion, language, manners, and complexion; for, they knew not the use of letters, and had no history but oral tradition.</P>

<P>Those Celtae, Galarae, Gauls, or Cimbri, are said to have been the descendants of Gomer, the son of Japhet, who having settled originally in the East, multiplied to such a degree, that they were obliged to send off colonies, one of which, under the conduct of Acmon, penetrated into Europe, where he established the empire of the Titans: This was farther extended by his successors, Saturn, Jupiter, Dis, and Mercury or Teutat, who conquered all the western parts of Europe, and maintained his sway to the extremities of Germany and Gaul.

<P>These chiefs of their legislature and superstition are supposed to have adopted the principles and ceremonies of the Curetes, who were also descended from Gomer, and to have derived their appellation from the Celtic word Deru, which signifies an oak, because they held this tree as sacred, and celebrated their rites and sacrifices in sequestered groves, where the silence and solitude of the place assisted their contemplation. They, and they only, pretended to exercise the art of divination; they offered the sacrifices in public as well as in private, and interpreted the will of heaven. They were always attended by a concourse of young men, the charge of whose education they undertook: they decided in all controversies, whether the dispute turned upon misdemeanors, capital crimes, inheritance or property: they acquitted or condemned; they distributed rewards or punishments; and if any person refused to abide by their decisions, he was interdicted from all religious rites and intercourse, deprived of the benefit of the laws, rendered incapable of any office of trust or honour, and held in universal abhorrence, as a monster of sacrilege and impiety.</P>
<P>One particular Druid presided over all the rest with unlimited authority, and at his death, the next in learning, dignity, and virtue, was elected as his suc∣cessor: not but that sometimes there was a warm competition for this honourable pontificate; and in that case, it was generally determined by force of arms; though the Druids, by their profession, were exempted from the hardships and perils of war, as well as from taxes and all other kinds of imposition. Such im∣munities could not fail to invite numbers into their order, and even those of the prime nobility.

Indeed their whole law and religion seem to have been taught in verse; for, some Druids spent twenty years in learning to repeat those rhymes which were never committed to writing; either because the use of letters was unknown; or that they did not chuse to communicate their mysteries to the vulgar; or lastly, because they ima∣gined the understanding would improve by the exercise of the memory, which would have been rendered of little consequence had their poetry been perpetuated in written volumes o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> records.

Nor was their importance altogether owing to their religious character, but depended in a great measure on the dignity of their birth, and the interest of their family: for the function of a Druid neither derogated from their nobility, nor excluded them from the highest offices in the state: they continued to enjoy both with∣out the least restriction; and some of them were even known to exercise the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overeign power.

These were sent at first by deputies consisting of two virgins and five men, who were received with the greatest honours by the Delians; and when the virgins died, their funerals were celebrated with the utmost solemnity, and even hymns composed in their praise. The Hyperboreans, loth to run the risque of losing the most valu∣able persons of their nation, in such a tedious and hazardous peregrination, fell afterwards up∣on another expedient for sending their offerings to the temples of Apollo and Diana: they de∣livered them to their neighbours on the continent, requesting that they might be forwarded from one people to another, until they arrived at the Adriatic, where they were put into the hands of the Dodonians, who conveyed them safely to Delos. As the Greeks increased in reputation for learning, the Druids of the Hebrides dissatisfied with this dista<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> manner of communica∣tion, dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted one of their number to go and discover what improvements had been made in knowlege, and renew the antient league with the Delians. This was the famous Abaris, celebrated by Jamblicus; and Porphyry, who says he was a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest of Apollo; that he travelled ever all Greece, and passing to Crocona in Italy, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sited Pythagoras, with whom he contracted an int macy of friendship.—Strabo gives us to un∣derstand that Aba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s was admired by the Greeks for his politeness and integrity.

<P>Notwithstanding all the learning which has been displayed, and the ingenious conjectures that have been formed from the si uation of the Hebrides, the disposition of the natives, the nature of their worship, and the remains of their temples, to prove that they were the Hyperbo∣reans of which this philosopher was a native; the fact still remains dubious and uncertain. The great antiquity of the event has removed it without the sphere of distinct observation. Diodorus Siculus, who describes this Hyperbo∣rean island, certainly believed it was different from Britain or Ireland, with which he was well acquainted; otherwise he would have distin∣guished it by its proper name: such a corre∣spondence between the Delians and Hyperbo∣rean islanders could not fail to open a trade be∣tween Greece and Britain, which did not take place till some centuries after this period, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many of the states of Greece were then ac∣quainted with navigation. Herodotus, in relat∣ing the story of the Hyperborean deputies, does not mention one word of their coming from an island; and looks upon the circumstance of Abaris as a meer sable.

Strangers to luxury, and even to what are now thought the necessaries of life, their wealth consisted in their herds of cattle, which they drove from place to place for the convenience of pasture, like the antient Nomades: as for the tin, lead, iron, corn, ivory bridles, collars, amber, glass vessels, baskets, and other toys, which were exported from Britain, they were manufactured by the Belgae, and other nations who settled in the maritime parts of the island: the inland inhabitants dealt in nothing but cattle, hides, and tallow, which they bartered for such things as they deemed indispensably necessary; they lived in wretched huts or cabbins made of boughs, and plaistered with mud; and even in these they found means to manifest their hospitality to strangers, whom they esteemed as sacred and inviolable.

The dress of their nobles consisted of a belted plaid of variegated colours, with trousers, that answered the purposes of stockings as well as breeches; and these were common to all the Gauls upon the continent: some of those who could not afford to purchase this habit, covered themselves with skins, and the poorer sort went almost quite naked. Perhaps it was in conse∣quence of this want of covering, that they had recourse to the practice of painting their bodies, with a substance that shut up the pores, and defended the nerves of the skin from the inclemencies of the weather: thus fortified, Dio Nicaeus tells us, they could endure the severest cold, and even remain whole days immersed in mud. They were poorly provided with warlike weapons, either for annoyance or defence: the better sort used the broad sword and dagger, together with javelins and arrows; but the common people had no other offensive arms than sharpened sticks for javelins, and long staves edged with flint, or headed with copper, in lieu of halberts, which were likewise furnished with a kind of bell to scare their enemies in battle. They had neither coats of mail nor helmets, but defended themselves with light round targets of wood, or twigs covered with leather and studded with nails of brass. The only finery which they affected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. Vit. Agricol.</NOTE> was in their chariots of war, which were curiously carved and painted, and so contrived as to be stopped and turned on the declivity of hills, with astonishing dexterity: they were generally drawn by two horses; and each contained the driver and a single warrior, who darted his javelins at the enemy, and even drove among their thickest ranks, terrifying, trampling, and cutting them in pieces with long scythes fixed to the axle-tree of the wheels. They frequently<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frontinus de Stratagem.</NOTE> leaped from their chariots, and fought on foot, until being fatigued or overpow∣ered, they resumed their seats; and they were so expert in the management of those machines, that they could stop or turn them at full speed, sit, stand, run upon the beam, and leap out and in, as the occasion required. They often re∣treated on purpose to draw the enemy into confusion, and then returned to the attack with redoubled fury; but, they always engaged in separate bodies, that they might have room to act, and sustain those that wanted succour. The Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, as well as the Gauls, were remarkably bold and enterprising; they charged with surprising impetuosity, after having endeavoured to intimidate the foe with
<PB N="12" REF="210"/>
the hoarse and dismal sound of their barbarous trumpets, repeated shouts, and the clashing of their arms; and they advanced to battle, dancing like the Cu∣retes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diod l. 1.</NOTE> and singing the valiant deeds of their ancestors. They were warlike, even in their favourite diversion, which was hunting; and, for this reason, their princes and chiefs commonly fixed their habitation in the midst of woods and forests, frequented by the game; and, indeed, this was the situation of all their towns, which were composed of miserable huts, built in spots cleared of wood, which served them as a fortification; for they were almost always at war, with one ano∣ther, or with the colonies of the Belgae, and other nations which they could ne∣ver forgive for their intrusion. This enmity may have become more rancorous after they were invaded by Divitiacus, king of the Suessones, who being in great credit with the whole body of the Belgae, resolved to make their friend∣ship subservient to his ambition, and conquer the island of Britain by their assis∣tance. For this purpose, he, about five and twenty years before Caesar's expedi∣tion, assembled a great army of his own subjects, reinforced by the Bibroci, the Atrebates, and other Belgic nations adjoining to his own territories, and passing over into Britain defeated the natives in several encounters. He sub∣dued the countries at present known by the names of Berks, Oxford, Hants, Wilts, Somerset, and Suffex; in which he planted colonies of his Belgian auxi∣liaries, after having expelled the Regni and other tribes of the old inhabitants. The Belgae, who were already settled in Britain, probably submitted and joined him on this occasion; a circumstance that could not fail to render them still more odious to the native islanders. These unintermitting hostilities kept up their martial disposition and contempt of danger, which was not confined to the male sex, but shone so remarkable in the British women, that they often rushed into the battle, and braved the weapons of the enemy. They always at∣tended their husbands in the field, encouraging them to deeds of glory; no<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>utarch de vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> war was undertaken without their advice; they judged of the contraventions of public treaties; they sat in council, and were consulted on the most important occasions.</P>

<P>Had the Britons, such as we have described them, brave, honest, and ingenious, been united under one well-regulated government, which would have bridled their ferocity, reconciled them to subordination, and provided for the safety of the state; in all probability they would have preserved their freedom and independency against the whole Roman power: but, there was a fatal defect in their constitution, arising from the vast number of petty sovereignties, ruled by their own particular Reguli, who could not be easily brought to act in concert against the common enemy. True it is, a number of these little principalities had already united together into considerable states, either ruled by kings, as the Cattieuchlani, Iceni, and Brigantes; or commanded by a general, occasionally elected, as the Silures and Ordovices: but those that lived remote from the danger, do not seem to have been affected by the fate of their countrymen who were attacked, or to have favoured them with the least assistance, except the Ordovices, who acted in behalf of their neighbours the Silures.</P>
<P>Besides, they were very ill supplied with arms, destitute of money, and warlike stores, and ignorant of discipline and military experience: they lived in a level open country, without inclosure, or any place of rendezvous or retreat, except their im∣penetrable woods, and inaccessible bogs and mountains in the northern parts of
<PB N="13" REF="220"/>
the island; in a word, they were unfurnished of all means of defence, except their native courage and love of liberty. In this naked situation they were alarmed with the news of an invasion, and summoned to make head against the Roman power, commanded and directed by the greatest general that ever lived, who had already triumphed over prodigious armies of Germans and Gauls, ac∣knowledged to be the most powerful nations in Europe, with a body of veteran troops that were deemed invincible.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>JULIUS CAESAR having conquered Gaul, and severely chastised the Germans, who had crossed the Rhine, in order to favour a general re∣volt and insurrection of their neighbours, resolved to make a descent upon the island of Britain, which was almost altogether unknown to the Romans. His pretence was to punish the islanders, for having sent succours to the Gauls while he waged war against that nation, as well as for granting an asylum to the Belgae, after having excited them to a rebellion, in consequence of which they were routed, and compelled to abandon their own country. These were sufficient mo∣tives in a Roman general, considering the political maxims of that people, who always looked upon the auxiliaries of their enemies as principals in the quarrel, and attacked them accordingly, without any declaration of war, concerning which they were in other cases extremely formal and punctilious. Over and above these inducements, some authors suppose Caesar to have been influenced by the hopes of finding a great quantity of fine British pearls, which were then much in re∣quest. But avarice was no part of his character; and we may with more plau∣sibility<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suetoniu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> suppose, he was, on this occasion, actuated by that ambition and thirst of glory which seems to have been the characteristic of his disposition.</P>
<P>Whatever the true dictates of his heart may have been, he determined to em∣ploy the latter part of the summer, that remained after his German expedition, in an hostile visit to Britain; and though he should find the season too far ad∣vanced to make any progress in the operations of war, he foresaw advantage in making himself acquainted with the coast, creeks, and harbours, as well as with the genius of the inhabitants, which were very little known, even to the traders who went thither on account of commerce. With this view he previ∣ously
<PB N="14" REF="230"/>
consulted the merchants, who could give him no satisfaction touching the size of the island, the number of nations by whom it was possessed, their laws and customs, their practice in war, or their harbours, that were capable of con∣taining a great number of large vessels. Thus left to his own conjectures, he detached C. Volusenus in a frigate to examine the coast, and return as soon as possible with his report; while he himself advanced, with all his forces, into the territory of the Morini, which lay nearest to the British shore; and here he or∣dered that all his ships should be assembled, without delay.</P>
<P>Mean while, his design being communicated by some merchants to the inhabi∣tants of the maritime parts of Britain, chiefly those who had removed thither from the opposite continent, they sent ambassadors to make their submission, and promised to deliver hostages for their good behaviour. Caesar received them with great com∣placency, and having exhorted them to continue stedfast in the same sentiments, dismissed them to their own country, together with a British prince, called Co∣mius, whom he had appointed king over the Atrebates, and of whose attach∣ment and sagacity he was well assured. Knowing this Comius was held in great veneration and esteem in Britain, he directed him to visit the different states, and use his influence in persuading them to sollicit the protection of the Romans, which he would grant on his arrival in the island. As for Volusenus, he returned in five days from the coast of Britain, which he had examined from the sea, with∣out daring to land on such an hostile shore; and imparted his observations to Cae∣sar, who formed his plan accordingly.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Having collected about eighty transports, which he judged sufficient for the embarkation of two legions, and allotted for his cavalry eighteen of a larger burthen, that were wind-bound on another part of the coast, at the distance of eight miles, he distributed his officers on board of a few gallies, ordered the rest of his army to be cantoned among the Menapii and part of the Morini, un∣der the conduct of Q. Titurius Sabinus, and L. Aurunculeius Cotta, and left P. Sulpicius Rufus, with a sufficient garrison, to occupy the place and harbour where he now lay.</P>

Finding it impracticable to gain the shore in that place, on account of the swelling surf and the impending mountains, from whence his soldiers must have been griev∣ously annoyed by the Britons, he resolved to choose a more favourable strand, for making his descent. Mean while as he lay at anchor, to wait for that part of the fleet which had not yet arrived, he called a council of his officers, to whom he imparted the remarks of Volusenus, together with his disposition for landing, and the precise order bywhich every individual was to act in his own province; then taking the first opportunity of the wind and tide, he made the signal for weigh∣ing anchor, and sailed about eight miles along shore, till he found an open road, and a level country.</P>
<P>The Britons, suspecting his design, detached their cavalry and chariots of war to the same spot, and following with the rest of their forces, took possession of the ground, in such a manner, as to hinder the Romans from approaching the shore; for, as their ships drew too much water to float near the beach, the
<PB N="15" REF="240"/>
soldiers were obliged to leap overboard; when being encumbered with the weight of their armour, intangled in the sea, and exposed to the risque of plunging into unknown holes, and caverns under water; they did not fight with their usual alacrity, but seemed affrighted at the fury and resolution of the islanders, who not only galled them with their javelins from the shore, but even rushed upon them in the sea, fighting hand to hand with amazing vigour and intrepidity.</P>
<P>Caesar, perceiving the disadvantage under which his soldiers laboured, directed his gallies to be rowed nearer to the shore, so as to flank the Britons, against whom the slings, arrows, and projectile machines were plyed with great execution and success; for, the islanders, as much confounded and intimidated at the strange figure of the gallies, the motion of the oars, and the contrivance of the balistae, as at the damage they sustained from the stones and missile weapons, suddenly paused, and then retired to a small distance. Notwithstanding this check the Ro∣mans seemed averse to trust themselves in such a depth of water, when the stand∣ard-bearer of the tenth legion observing their backwardness, leaped into the sea, calling aloud, "Follow me, my fellow-soldiers, unless you want to betray the ea∣gle into the hands of the enemy." Thus adjured, they sprung overboard with∣out further hesitation, and made towards the shore, where being met by the ene∣my, a very obstinate battle ensued, which had like to have proved fatal to the Romans, who finding it impossible to form in the water, could not avail them∣selves of their discipline and military skill, while those who gained the shore were surrounded and cut in pieces, before they could assemble in any number, or be drawn up in order of battle.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>In this emergency, Caesar commanded the boats belonging to the fleet to be crammed with soldiers, in order to row about and sustain those who wanted succour: and this expedient determined the fortune of the day, by enabling his men to gain firm footing on the beach, where, forming immediately in a consi∣derable body, they proceeded to charge with their usual considence; and now profiting by that heavy armour which had encumbered them before, they soon compelled the naked Britons to quit the field with precipitation; though Caesar could not improve his victory for want of his horse, which were not yet arrived <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>This descent was made from the Downes, and the battle fought at the place which is now called Deal; as Caesar's own account of the expedition, plainly evinces; for, the land he first made could be no other than Dover, which is nearer than any other part of Britain to the Gallican shore; and he describes the cliffs with great accuracy. From thence he sailed with the tide setting to the northward, and turning a point of land, which was the South foreland, came to an anchor in the Downes, after a pro∣gress of eight miles. The distance from Dover, the headland he turned, the flatness of the beach and the openness of the country, leave no room to suspect that the place of his land∣ing could be any other than Deal. This sup∣position is confirmed by the tradition of the Bri∣tons as well as of the Saxons, who mentioned the circumstance in a table hung up in Dover castle; this opinion is likewise embraced by Nennius, who says, Caesar ad Dole bellum pug∣navit; and Camden observed in this place, the remains of the ramparts which Caesar raised to defend the shipping from the assaults of the wea∣ther and the enemy.</P>
<P>The day of his landing was the 26th of Au∣gust in the afternoon, as the learned Hally has demonstrated from the circumstances of the histo∣ry, and the ebbing and flowing of the tides. Philosoph. trans. No. 193.</P></NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesar. Com∣ment. Strabo. Dio.</NOTE> The Britons, dispirited by this defeat, no sooner recollected themselves from their consternation, than they sent ambassadors to implore the clemency of Caesar, and along with them Comius the Atrebatian, whom, as a creature of the Ro∣man general, they had seized and shackled on his first landing, before he had an
<PB N="16" REF="250"/>
opportunity of signifying the cause of his arrival. But now that they were van∣quished in battle, they ascribed this outrage to the fury of the ungovernable multitude; begged pardon for the offence, promised to deliver hostages, and in all things to obey his commands.</P>
<P>Caesar complained, that after having of their own accord sent ambassadors to the continent, with offers of peace and submission, they had nevertheless opposed his landing in such an hostile manner; but, he forgave their indiscretion, and demanded a certain number of hostages; part of whom they immediately deli∣vered, and promised to send for the rest with all convenient dispatch from the remoter provinces. Mean while they dismissed their troops, and their princes and lords assembling, recommended themselves and their different states to the protection of Caesar: though this submission seems to have been extorted by the necessity of the occasion; for, they afterwards renounced it with the first opportunity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Their session was yet not broke up, when the eighteen ships, with the Roman cavalry, sailing from Gaul with a gentle breeze, no sooner approached the British coast, than they were dispersed by a terrible tempest of wind blowing off the shore, and obliged to return to the port they had left, at which they arrived with great difficulty, after having narrowly escaped the horrors of shipwreck. This storm, which happened at the full moon, was attended with such an high tide, that in the night all the gallies which the Romans had hauled ashore for safety, were filled with water; while of those which rode at anchor, some ran foul of one another and were destroyed, and the rest were rendered useless by the loss of their anchors, cables, masts and rigging: a miserable spectacle to the army on shore, who could give them no assistance; and having no materials for re∣fiting the damaged vessels, saw themselves deprived of the means of returning to Gaul, and destitute of provision on which they could subsist through the winter in Britain.</P>
<P>The island chiefs, who had not yet separated, resolved to take the advantage of this calamity, by which they saw the Romans dispirited: they conferred with each other upon this opportunity which fortune had put in their power; they re∣pined at the loss of their liberty; upbraided themselves with their infamously tame submission to an handful of enemies, without cavalry, subsistance, or ships to which they might retire: they looked upon their invaders as victims devoted to des∣truction, and determined to sacrifice them to the genius of their country. In these sentiments, they gradually disappeared from the Roman camp, and began privately to reassemble their forces; while Caesar suspecting their design, as the natural consequence of what had happened, as also from their delaying to send in the rest of the hostages, began to make preparations for his own safety. He ordered all the corn and provision in the neighbourhood to be brought into the camp, dispatched a vessel to the continent for materials to repair the shipping; and this work his men undertook with such ardour, that in a little time the whole fleet was rendered fit for service, except twelve ships that perished in the storm.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions, the seventh legion being sent out as usual to forage, at a time when the peace lately concluded was supposed to be in full force, and the Roman camp was openly frequented by the Britons, the senti∣nels perceived a greater cloud of dust than could possibly arise from the legion
<PB N="17" REF="260"/>
that went forth, and communicated this observation to Caesar, who immediately suspecting some new attempt of the islanders, marched out at the head of the cohorts that were upon duty, after having ordered other bands to take their station; and the rest of the army to follow him with the utmost expedition: when he had advanced a good way from the camp, he found the seventh legion hard pressed by the enemy, who concluding they would naturally come to this place, as here only the corn was not yet reaped, had formed an ambuscade in the woods, from which they suddenly fell upon the Romans, when they were dispersed and unarmed, so as to cut off a few, and disorder the rest, who could hardly resist the attacks of such a furious multitude as surrounded them; for, the Britons not only showered their darts and javelins at a distance, but likewise drove among them with their chariots of war, by which they were greatly dis∣tressed. They were, therefore, very seasonably relieved by their general, at whose arrival the enemy intermitted in their action. Caesar judging <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t im∣proper to provoke them to a general engagement, kept his ground for some time, in order of battle, and then retreated to his camp, in which he was confined for several days successively, by tempestuous weather. But, this did not hinder the Britons from dispatching messengers to all parts of the coun∣try, with accounts of the small number and dejection of the Romans, in consequence of which they assembled from different quarters to an immense number of horse and foot, and boldly advanced towards the enemy's intrenchments.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>Caesar, far from baulking their impatience, marched out to meet and give them battle, when they were quickly routed with great slaughter, and all their habi∣tations, for a considerable circuit, set on fire and destroyed. That same day they sent deputies to supplicate the mercy of the Roman commander, who granted them peace, on condition that they should send to the continent double the num∣ber of the hostages he at first demanded; and now that the autumnal aequinox approached, and his ships were very unfit for a winter voyage, he forthwith re∣embarked his army and returned to Gaul.</P>
<P>Such was the success of the first attempt the Romans made on the liberty of Britain, which was defended by the natives with all that spirit and enthusiasm which freedom and independency inspire; and thus ended that celebrated expedition of Caesar, which, tho' unattended with any other solid advantage than that of making him acquainted with the coast of the island, and the temper of the inha∣bitants, was extolled at Rome above all the victories he had obtained over the Germans and the Gauls, and his success in Britain acknowledged by a supplica∣tion of twenty days. Although this was an extravagant and ridiculous decree of the senate, considering the little progress he had made in his first descent, it is at least a glorious testimony of the opinion which the Romans, in the meridian of all their power and glory, entertained with regard to the valour of our an∣cestors; nevertheless, we cannot assent to the overweening conjectures of those who, from an illiberal partiality to their own country, pretend, that Caesar was actually defeated by the Britons; whereas it appears they were utterly unable to cope with him in the field, even when they had an immense superiority in point of number; that the small advantage they gained over the seventh legion was the effect of perfidy and surprize; and that his sudden return to the continent in such a shattered condition, did not so much denote his apprehension of the
<PB N="18" REF="270"/>
islanders, as his dread of a winter passage in crazy vessels which had suffered in the storm. Had he thought himself too weak to subdue the British power by the force of his arms, he would probably have had recourse to other arts, and endeavoured to foment divisions among the different states in the land; an ex∣pedient which could hardly have miscarried, as they they were ill affected to one another, and he could easily have found emissaries who would have gladly follow∣ed his instructions: it must be owned, however, that on this occasion they united for their common safety, and even the Belgian colonies acted in concert with the antient natives of the island.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The Britons no sooner saw themselves delivered from such troublesome visitants, than they seemed to forget the submissions and promises they had made, and two only of their states sent over the stipulated hostages to Caesar, who, in all appearance, was not much incensed at their neglect, inasmuch as it furnished him with a specious pretext for returning to Britain and reducing the whole island under the Roman dominion. Mean while, having put his army into quarters, he set out for Italy, but not before he had given orders and directions for refitting the damaged ships, and building a great number of other vessels of various con∣struction, for the greater convenience of transporting his legions and cavalry, as well as of floating in shallow water, that they might be landed with equal case and safety: they were broad, flat-bottomed boats, managed with oars, cal∣culated for lying close to the beach, and plying against the current of the tides. These orders being executed during the winter, under the inspection of his licute∣nants; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cables, anchors, and rigging, fetched from Spain, he returned to the army in Gaul, where he found six hundred transports and twenty eight gal∣lies ready to put to sea, and these he assembled at the port of Itium, (supposed to be Virsand) at the distance of thirty miles from the British coast.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>But, his departure was delayed by a commotion among the Treviri, who were said to have engaged with the Germans, in some intrigues against the Roman government. Caesar marching into their territories, at the head of four legions and eight hundred horse, confirmed Cingetorix in the magistracy, received the submission of the state, and carried off two hundred hostages, in∣cluding the sons and kindred of Indutiomarus, who was a turbulent man, and at the head of a great faction. Nor were these the only pledges he demand∣ed for the peaceable behaviour of the Gauls in his absence: when he returned to Itium, he convened the cavalry of Gaul, and all the chiefs, except a very few in whose attachment he could confide, resolving they should accompany him in his expedition. Among these was Dumnorix the Aeduan, who either dreading the dangers of the sea, or intending to raise a rebellion after Caesar's departure, earnestly desired to be excused from the voyage, and finding Caesar inflexible, withdrew in the night with the Aeduan cavalry; but being pursued and overtaken by Caesar's troops, he refused to return or submit; and fell fighting with great gallantry, and calling aloud, with his latest breath, that he was "a free-born Gaul, native of a free nation; and that he would not be enslaved."</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>As for the Aeduan cavalry, which had accompanied him in his retreat, they returned to Caesar, who, about the beginning of August, leaving Labienus at ltium with three legions and two thousand horse, in order to be a check upon the Gauls, and provide corn for the British expedition, set sail at sun-set with
<PB N="19" REF="280"/>
five legions, and the same number of cavalry he had left behind, his fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t consisting of eight hundred vessels; and next day at noon arrived at the place of his former descent, where he landed without opposition. There was not one Briton to be seen on that part of the coast: but, he afterwards understood from the prisoners, that the islanders apprised of his intent had assembled an ar∣my, and marched down to the sea-side to oppose his disembarkation, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> see∣ing the whole channel covered as it were with ships, they were struck with con∣stermation, and retreated to their lurking-places.</P>
<P>The army being landed, and the ground marked out for the camp, Caesar<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caes. de Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. Gallic. l. 50</NOTE> provided himself with guides, and leaving ten cohorts and three hundred horse, under the command of Q. Atrius, to guard the ships which lay at anchor in the Downs, he began his march in quest of the Britons. Hav∣ing advanced about twelve miles he came in sight of their army encamped near a river, the passage of which they disputed with their cavalry and cha∣riots; but, these being repulsed by the Romans, they retreated to a wood, in the midst of which there was a kind of fortification raised with felled timber. Here they posted themselves as in an impregnable fortress; but they were soon<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. U. C 700. Ante Ch. 54.</NOTE> dislodged by the tenth legion, and betook themselves to slight in the utmost confusion; tho' Caesar would not allow his horse to pursue them through an un∣known country, especially as the day was far advanced, and he had not yet forti∣fied his camp at the landing-place. In the morning however, he sent detach∣ments of cavalry and infantry in pursuit of the fugitives; yet they were soon re∣called, in consequence of a message from Q. Atrius, giving him to understand that the fleet had received great damage from a furious tempest, which had blown with such violence, that the anchors could not hold, and a number of ships were shattered and cast ashore. He forthwith marched down to the sea-side, where he learned the particulars of his loss, and found that forty ships were utterly destroyed: in order to repair the rest, he called all the carpenters from the le∣gions, and in a letter to Labienus, desired that all his workmen might be em∣ployed in building a number of new vessels. Mean while he ordered the ships to be hauled ashore, and fortified with the same trench and rampart that sur∣rounded his camp.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>This stupendous work being finished in ten days, with infinite labour, he appointed a proper guard or garrison for it's defence, and put his troops again in motion against the Britons, whom he found in the same place they had before occupied, to an incredible number. By this time their common danger had induced them to forget, or at least suppress their former seuds and animosi∣ties, and unite their whole strength for the mutual defence of their liberty and possessions. They had convened a general council of all their states and dy∣nasties, in order to deliberate on the emergency of their affairs, and foreseeing nothing but confusion and anarchy would prevail in an army composed of in∣dependent chiefs that owned no superior, and knew no subordination, they una∣nimously conferred a dictatorial power upon Cassivelaunus, whose territories (comprehending Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, and Bucks) were divided from the maritime states by the river Thames. This prince had been formerly en∣gaged in continual wars with his neighbours, and acquired such reputation in military skill, that they now deemed him worthy of being invested with the sove∣reign command; though this was a very dangerous experiment, which nothing
<PB N="20" REF="290"/>
could justify but their dangerous situation. They had no sooner raised him to this preheminence, than they resolved to strengthen his hands with such power as should enable him to act up to the importance of his station; and immediate∣ly armed and assembled their vassals so as to compose a very numerous and for∣midable army, with which Cassivelaunus took possession of the post from whence the Britons had been lately dislodged.</P>

<P>The first act of his imperatorial power was to detach his cavalry and chariots to harrass the Romans on their march; and this service they per∣formed with great intrepidity, falling upon the enemy's horse; which however obliged them to give way and abscond among the woods and mountains, where, being acquainted with the ground, they rallied, attacked, and cut in pieces some straggling Romans, who were too eager in the pursuit. Not satisfied with having made this undaunted effort, they afterwards rushed suddenly and unexpect∣edly from the woods, while the enemy were employed in fortifying their camp, and charged the grand guard with such impetuosity, that Caesar was obliged to send a strong body to sustain them; even then the couragious Britons forced their way through the intervals of the cohorts, and cutting their passage back again, re∣treated to their thicket, after having killed a number of Romans, and among the rest, the tribune Quintus Laberius Durus.</P>
<P>Caesar's legions, inured as they were to danger, and familiar with death, could not help manifesting their terror, at the headlong and almost irresistible attacks of the Britons, and the strange novelty in their manner of fighting, which gave them a great advantage over heavy-armed infantry, who could not pretend to pursue them when they gave way, and durst not break their ranks, or abandon their standards. Nor could the Roman cavalry fight them upon equal terms; for, they frequently retreated in seeming disorder, to decoy them into the pursuit; and when they were at too great a distance from the legions, to be pro∣perly sustained, they leaped from their chariots, and assailed them on foot: thus the danger was the same to the cavalry, whether they retreated or pursued. Besides, our islanders never engaged in great numbers, but fought in small bodies, dis∣posed in distinct stations, with large intervals between them, that they might support one another occasionally, and those that were fatigued might be relieved with fresh reinforcements.</P>
<P>On the day after this obstinate action, they shewed themselves at a distance upon the hills, without manifesting their former eagerness and alacrity in provoking the Romans to battle; but, at noon, when Caesar detached three le∣gions, with all the cavalry, to forage under the command of C. Trebonius; they suddenly poured upon the foragers from all quarters, and even charged the legions as they stood in order of battle: but, they were immediately repulsed with great loss. They were no sooner put in disorder than the horse fell in upon them with such precipitation, as left them no time to rally, form, or avail themselves of their chariots; so that they were entirely routed with great slaugh∣ter. The auxiliaries who had joined them from different corners of the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and, being dispirited by such a series of defeats, took the first opportunity of return∣ing to their own dictricts; and after this period, the Britons never hazarded a pitched battle with the army of Caesar.</P>

<P>This pohtic commander, apprized of the retreat of the auxiliaries, re∣solved to penetrate into the confines of Cassivellaunus, by crossing the river
<PB N="21" REF="300"/>
Thames at Coway near the Oatlands, where alone it was said to be fordable by infantry. When he arrived at this place, he found a great body of the Britons posted on the opposite bank, which they had fortified with sharpened palisadoes: they had likewise driven stakes of the same kind in the channel of the river, so as not to appear above the surface; a circumstance of which Caesar was inform∣ed by the prisoners and deserters.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these obstructions, he ordered his horse to ford the river, and the foot to follow without loss of time. They plunged into the stream, and proceeded with such celerity, even when up to their chins in water, that the enemy being struck with consternation, could not sustain the first shock, but abandoning their works, consulted their safety in a precipitate retreat.</P>
<P>Cassivellaunus having by this time resigned all hope of success in regular en∣gagements<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dismissed the greatest part of his troops, retaining about four thou∣sand charioteers, with whom he watched the motions of the Romans, and being perfectly well acquainted with the country through which they marched, attacked them occasionaly, when dispersed in foraging, or intangled in woods and narrow passes, to the great danger of the cavalry, who durst not venture to reconnoitre the road, or make excursions to any distance from the legions.</P>

<P>While Caesar laid waste the country with fire and sword, he received an embassy from the Trinobantes, a powerful people, inhabiting Middlesex and Essex, who promised to yield him obedience and submission, and requested that he would send their own prince Mandubratius to assume the regal authority among them, and protect him from the malice of Cassivellaunus, who had killed his father Imanuentius. The young prince had escaped his parent's fate by fly∣ing into Gaul, and craving the protection of Caesar, who now restored him to his subjects, after having obliged them to deliver forty hostages, and provide corn for the army <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">These were the Ceni-magni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bebraci, and Cassi, inhabiting Surry, Hampshire, Berks, Oxfordshire, Bucks, and Hertfordshire.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Their example was immediately followed by several other states of the Bel∣gic Britons, who seeing the Trinobantes protected from all military outrage, sur∣rendered to the conqueror, and gave him to understand that he was but at a little distance from the chief town of Cassivellaunus, situated among woods and morasses, in which a great number of men and cattle was assembled. Thither he marched without further delay, and tho' he found the place strongly fortified, both by art and nature, resolved to assault it in two different quarters; but, the besieged being unable to stand the attack, betook themselves to flight from another part of the town, tho' numbers of them perished by the sword, and the booty fell into the hands of the Romans.</P>

<P>Cassivelaunus thus hampered and distressed, sent orders to Cingeto∣rix, Carnelius, Taximagulus, and Segonax, princes whose territories lay in Kent, Wilts, and Hampshire, to assemble all their forces privately, and sur∣prize the naval camp of the Romans, while Caesar was at too great a distance to succour the troops he had left on the sea-side.

<P>By a letter from Cicero to Atticus, it appears that Caesar landed in G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l on the 26th of Sep∣tember; so that, after having reftted his ships and fortified his naval ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p in Britain, he could not have above twenty days left for his expedi∣tion against Caffivela<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us, whose territories were bounded by the Thames, at the distance of eighty miles from the sea, where the Ro∣mans landed.

The bad success of this attempt made a deep impression upon the mind of Cassivelaunus, who seeing his dominions ra∣vaged, his allies deserting his cause, and his troops altogether unable to cope with such a powerful enemy, by whom he had been so often defeated, he began to think, in good earnest, of submitting to the conqueror, to whom he com∣municated proposals of peace by means of Comius the Atrebatian.</P>
<P>Caesar, being resolved to pass the winter on the continent, that he might be at hand to watch, and suppress the sudden commotions of Gaul; and the sum∣mer being already almost elapsed, condescended to give peace to this British prince, after having exacted a number of hostages, imposed a certain annual tri∣bute to be paid by Britain to the Roman people, and laid strong injunctions on Cassivelaunus, to live in peace and friendship with Mandubratius and the Tri∣nobantes. Peace being thus re-established, he marched back with his hostages and a great number of prisoners to the sea-side, where he ordered his ships to be launched; and his army being put on board at two different embarkations, landed safely on the continent a few days before the autumnal aequinox.</P>

Caesar therefore reaped no other fruit from this conquest, than the glory of having carried the Roman arms beyond the ocean, into a country which was considered as an unknown land, divided in a manner from the whole world; unless we reckon, among the advantages accruing from this enterprize, a corslet of British pearls, which he dedicated as an offering in the temple of Ve∣nus Genetrix, the supposed author of his family, and a long train of captives, whom he employed about the scenes and tapestry of the theatre, on which his British a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chievements were represented <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>The British slaves were also employed in carrying the emperor's sedan, as appears by an old inscription in the gardens of cardinal Car∣penso.</P>
<P>That the Romans did not look upon Caesar's enterprize as an absolute conquest of Britain, we learn from authors of the best authority.

<BIBL>Territa quaefitis ostendit terga Britanni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whether or not the Britons were
<PB N="23" REF="320"/>
punctual in fulfilling their engagements with Caesar, cannot be determined from history; but probably the maritime settlements were regular in their payment of the tribute, which for that reason we may suppose to have been easily raised<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for after the death of Julius Caesar, the Britons lived in great tranquility, with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out feeling the rod of arbitrary power, or the oppressive impositions of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arici∣ous proconsuls, during the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigns of Augustus and his successor. Not but that the former, in the sixth year of his imperial dignity, when he crossed the Alps to regulate the tribute imposed upon the several nations of Gaul, formed the de∣sign of an expedition into Britain, with a view of subjecting the natives to the same regulations: but, the chiefs of the island being informed of his intent, found means to divert the storm, by sending a solemn embassy to sue for peace, and present oblations to the capitol. The emperor having revolved the expence of such an enterprize, judged it impolitic to exhaust so much treasure in the conquest of a remote people, who could never be in a capacity to attack the Romans in their own territories; especially as they already received greater sums from the duties laid upon British merchandize, than they could expect from a general tribute, after deducting the expence of troops and garrisons, which would in that case become necessary.</P>

Thus the Romans became insensibly masters of Britain in speculation, and began to wonder that a country so well known, had not yet been reduced into a province: the interests of the state gave way to the pros∣pects of ambition; and though they already enjoyed all the solid and truly de∣sirable advantages of a conquest, in the voluntary and pacific submission of the natives, the epithet of Britannicus had irresistible charms in the eyes of a weak, vain, arrogant, and worthless emperor, such as Caius Caligula, who, in the extravagance of a freak, resolved to invade Britain, and restore a prince of that island called Adminius, who had been expelled by his own father, and fled for refuge to Rome.

<P>Perhaps the ardour with which this cowardly emperor at first formed the re∣solution of conquering Britain, was effectually cooled by the account he heard of the preparations which the islanders had made for his reception: certain it is, the pusilanimous conduct he manifested on this occasion when at the head of such an immense army, brought the Roman power into contempt with the war∣like Britons; and this begat a careless security, in the midst of which they were surprised and enslaved by Claudius, after they had preserved their liberty above ninety years, during the reigns of the first four emperors. In this period, how∣ever, they did not enjoy that tranquility which they might have derived from the forbearance of the Romans; on the contrary it afforded leisure and oppor∣tunity to the different states and chieftains to renew their former bickerings, and enabled the more powerful potentates to subdue the petty sovereignties that lay contiguous to their dominions.</P>

<P>We have already observed that the Cattivellauni, a warlike clan of the antient inhabitants, had greatly extended their sway over the Belgic Britons, who were perhaps enervated by their correspondence with the nations of the continent; particularly with the Romans, who bought up their commodities, and contributed more than all the rest of the world to the support of their trade,

which they found too comfortable and advantageous to be risqued in favour of a starving independency.</P>
<P>These intestine divisions rendered Britain an easy conquest to such a powerful people as the Romans, who had long ago converted Gaul into a province, and thereby facilitated the expedition into this island, which nevertheless might have been postponed to a succeeding reign, considering the indolence and phlegmatic disposition of Claudius, had not he been roused and stimulated by the exhorta∣tions and importunities of a British fugitive, of the name of Beric, a chieftain among the Dobuni of Dorsetshire.

<P>CLAUDIUS, thus daily instigated by the remonstrances of the British exile, reinforced by his favourites, who flattered him with the prospects of laurels and triumphs, resolved to send over an army under the command of A. Plautius, a person of senatorial dignity, and of great experience and military skill.
<PB N="26" REF="350"/>
This officer was accordingly provided with troops and instructions, and set out on this important expedition. But, when he arrived at the sea side, his soldiers refused to embark for an island which they considered as another distinct world; and this refusal, which seemed at first so unpromising, contributed in the event to the success of the enterprize: for, the Britons being informed of the mutiny, intermitted in the measures they were taking to defend the coast, and afterwards, when the army of Plautius submitted of their own accord to the orders of their general, they made a descent on the island without opposition.</P>
<P>Caratacus and Togodumnus, foreseeing the insinuations of Beric at the court of Rome, had sent thither ambassadors to justify their conduct, and desire that fugitive might be sent back, in order to be punished for his perfidy and rebellion: but, he had anticipated their resentment, and so artfully ingratiated himself with the emperor, that Claudius treated the deputies with insolence and disdain, refused to deliver the Dobunian, and in his turn, demanded the arrears of the tribute imposed by Julius Caesar, which the Cattivellaunians had neglected to pay. This arrogant behaviour towards the ambassadors, incensed Caratacus and his brother to such a degree, that they not only rejected his proposal about the tribute, but likewise ordered their subjects, on pain of incurring the severest penalties, to break of all correspondence with the Romans.</P>
<P>In consequence of such an open rupture, they naturally expected an invasion, and made preparations accordingly, which were now frustrated by their confi∣dence in the mutiny of the Roman army, which was remarkably obstinate and audacious; for, trusting to this obstruction, which they deemed insurmountable, the two British kings had withdrawn their forces into the interior parts of their dominions, leaving the coast open and defenceless.</P>

<P>Plautius, having obtained four successive victories over the enemy, thought it was now high time to give the emperor notice of his proceedings, according to the instructions he had received, that he might have the honour of putting an end to the war in person. Claudius immediately embarked at Ostium in the latter end of July, for Marseilles, from whence he travelled by land to Boulogne, then known by the name of Gessoriacum, where he took ship∣ing for the British coast, with a very considerable reinforcement, and landed safely at the Portus Rutupinus, now called Sandwich.</P>
<P>The soldiers were no sooner disembarked, than he proceeded to the bank of the Thames, on which Plautius was encamped, and the armies being joined, crossed the river in the face of the Britons, who bravely disputed their passage. From hence the emperor advanced into the country of the Trinobantes, and took the capital Camulodunum, now called Malden in Essex.</P>
<P>The fame of these exploits, and the terror of such a numerous army, brought nations every day to his camp with offers of submission, especially from the Bel∣gic Britons of that neghbourhood: but, none of the antient natives would give up their liberty, though the Iceni courted his friendship and were considered as allies: while Caratacus, at the head of the Cassivellauni, still kept the field, in hope of seeing the Romans retire at the approach of winter.</P>
<P>Claudius, having disarmed those that submitted, and reduced many petty states to his obedience by force of arms, was several times proclaimed Imperator by the soldiers; and the vanquished were so touched with his generosity in leaving them to enjoy their possessions, that they erected temples to him, and ranked him among their deities.

<P>Plautius, in the character of proconsul or governor of Britain, proceeded in the conquest of those states who still refused to submit; and while he himself carried on his operations chiefly against the inland, warlike, and original islanders, who lived among woods and mountains, Fl.

<P>After his departure, the war was probably managed by the legates of the legions, for the space of two years that intervened between the return of Plautius, and the arrival of P. Ostorius Scapula, an active and experienced ge∣neral, who was sent over to the government of Britain, and found the affairs of his province in great confusion. Though the season for action was already almost elapsed, yet, as the troops of Caratacus made continual incursions into the Roman province, in hope that the new governor would not expose himself in a strange country to the inconveniencies of a winter campaign, he forthwith assembled his troops, and taking the field against them, defeated all those that hazarded an encounter. Then, with a view to defend the province from the continual insults to which it was exposed from such restless neighbours, he re∣solved to confine and restrain them by a chain of forts to be raised along the river Anton or Nen, in Northamptonshire, and on the banks of the Severne; but, before he began to execute this resolution, he established a Roman colony at Camulodunum or Malden; and London being settled much about the same time, the country between the Thames and the sea was reduced into a pro∣vince, under the name of Britannia prima.</P>

They engaged in a confederacy with some of the neighbouring states, and joining their forces, took possession of an advantageous post, which they fortified with loose flints for annoying the feet of the Roman cavalry: notwithstanding this precaution, they were attacked by Ostorius, and their intrenchments forced, after they had made a desperate resistance. After this victory he took measures for securing the province from any
<PB N="29" REF="380"/>
future incursions of those nations; and, in order to defend the Roman conquests on the side of the Severne, he allowed Cogidunus, king of the Dobuni, posses∣sing the counties of Gloucester and Oxford, to keep his principality, and even invested him with authority over some other Belgic colonies: a politic expedi∣ent, which succeeded to his wish, by fomenting the dissentions among the Bri∣tons, and attaching a powerful prince to the Roman interest, which he never abandoned in the sequel.</P>
<P>Ostorius, having made these prudent dispositions, marched into the country of the Canges, or Shropshire, which he ravaged with fire and sword, and pe∣netrated almost to the sea-coast of Denbyshire, when he was recalled by the revolt of the Brigantes in Yorkshire, whither he marched with great expedi∣tion; and having quelled the disturbance, punished the ringleaders of the in∣surrection with death <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This insurrection was not quelled before Ostorius had routed the Brigantes in the field.

<P>These examples of severity had no effect upon the Silures, inhabiting Here∣fordshire and great part of South Wales, the most powerful nation in the island, commanded by their king Caratacus, reckoned the most martial prince that Britain had ever produced.

<P>Ostorius being apprised of their strength, thought proper to employ his legions in this expedition; and immediately began his march throughout Shropshire, in order to attack them at once, and terminate the war by one de∣cisive blow. Caratacus, unwilling to bring the war into the country of the Silures, passed the river Teme, that divides Herefordshire from Shropshire; and being reinforced by a body of the Ordovices from different parts of Wales, took possession of a very advantageous post, upon an inaccessible mountain, washed by a deep and rapid stream <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In all probability the Colun or Clun that falls into the Teme, hard by a very steep hill, called at this day Caer-Caradoc, on the top of which are the remains of a camp surrounded with stone ramparts, though now covered with earth.

<P>When he saw the enemy approaching, he drew up his army, composed of different tribes, commanded by their own respective chieftains, and going in per∣son from rank to rank, exhorted them to exert their utmost courage and reso∣lution, inasmuch as their liberty and happiness depended upon the fortune of the day. To these remonstrances they replied with joyous shouts and acclama∣tions; which did not fail to startle Ostorius, who began to think that the nature of their situation, the river that ran in their front, and their eagerness and alacrity to engage, were obstacles not to be surmounted. Encouraged, however, by the ardour of his troops, who called aloud that nothing was im∣possible to Roman courage, he gave the signal for the attack, in consequence of which they sprung forward with the utmost intrepidity. The river was soon
<PB N="30" REF="390"/>
passed; but, in approaching the British camp, they received a shower of jave∣lins and other missiles, which brought a number of the Romans to the ground. Notwithstanding this terrible discharge, they advanced to the rampart, which being composed of loose stones, was easily demolished in several places: as soon as they had an opportunity of using their swords, such carnage ensued, that the Britons were totally routed; and their defeat was the more severely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, as the wife, daughters, and brothers of Caratacus fell into the hands of the conqueror. This victory was followed, in a few days, with an advantage which Ostorius could not foresee: Caratacus himself, who had fled for refuge to Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantes, was delivered into his hands by that princess, because she dreaded the resentment of the victor, in case she should grant an asylum to the vanquished king.</P>
<P>Thus was the gallant Caratacus treacherously surrendered to the Roman ge∣neral, after he had commanded the confederate Britons for nine years suc∣cessively, during which he had made such incredible efforts to maintain the liberty of his country, against officers and armies inured to conquest, that his renown had long ago reached the city of Rome, where his name was equally dreaded and revered.</P>

<P>Claudius was no sooner informed of his being taken, than he ordered him to be conducted to his court, in order to exhibit him as a spectacle to the Roman people. Accordingly, on the day appointed for that purpose, the empe∣ror ascended his throne in public, and commanded the captives to be brought into his presence. First appeared the vassals of the British king, with the trap∣pings and spoils of the war; these were followed by his wife, brothers, and daugh∣ter, imploring mercy with the most piteous and abject lamentations; last of all came Caratacus, with a dignified aspect, betraying neither fear nor perplexity in his countenance; but, approaching the tribunal, he fixed his eyes on Claudius, and is said to have spoke to this effect. <Q>“Had my moderation been equal to my birth and fortune, I had arrived in this city, not a captive, but an ally; nor wouldst thou have disdained the alliance of a prince, like me, descended from illustrious progenitors, and vested with the supreme authority over many warlike nations. My present fate redounds as much to thy honour as to my own disgrace. I was in possession of vassals, horses, arms, and wealth: what wonder then that I was unwilling to lose them? for tho' you are ambitious of universal sway, it does not follow that all men ought tamely to submit to your dominion. Had I surrendered myself in the beginning of the contest, nei∣ther my misfortune, nor thy glory, would have attracted the attention of the world, and my fate would have been buried in oblivion. But, if thou wilt spare my life, I shall be an eternal monument of thy clemency.”</Q> The emperor was affected with this address of the British hero, whom he pardoned on the spot; and ordering the captives to be unchained, the first use they made of their liberty was to go and prostrate themselves before the empress Agrippina, who sat en∣throned in the same place, and was supposed to have interceded with Claudius in their behalf. The conquest and captivity of Caratacus was extolled as highly at Rome as that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Syphax by P. Scipio, and that of Perseus by L. Paulus; and the senate decreed the honours of a triumph to Ostorius, whose fortune seemed to forsake him in the sequel: for, whether the Roman troops in Britain became more secure and negligent, after the reduction of Caratacus, or the Britons ac∣quired

redoubled courage and activity from resentment and despair, they now gained several advantages over the enemy; they suddenly fell upon a Roman quarter-master general, who had been left with a body of troops to build forts in the country of the Silures, and cut him in pieces, together with eight centurions, and a number of legionary soldiers; on which occasion all the cohorts would have met with the same fate, had not they been sustained by succours from the nearest stations. In a little time after this exploit, they defeated the foragers and their convoy of cavalry; nay, when Ostorius came up in person with the legions, they maintained the battle till night, and then retired.</P>

<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>These actions were followed by innumerable skirmishes, fought in woods and morassses with various success; for, they took all opportunities of fall∣ing upon the straggling parties of the Romans, against whom the Silures glow∣ed with the most implacable revenge, in consequence of having heard that the emperor declared the Britons would never be quiet, until the Silures should un∣dergo the fate of the Sigambri, in being extirpated from their own country and transported to Gaul. Exasperated at this declaration, they redoubled their hostilities; they intercepted two auxiliary cohorts that were busied in pillaging for the benefit of their officers, and by distributing the booty and the captives among the neighbouring nations, paved the way for a general revolt; when Os∣torius<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ostorius dies in Britain.</NOTE> died oppressed with cares and disappointment. The Britons rejoiced at this event, by which they were freed from a vigilant enemy, who, though not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 53.</NOTE> killed in battle, they justly supposed owed his death to the war, which he found himself unable to conclude.</P>
<P>Considering the precarious and unsettled condition of the Roman province in Britain, this was no time to leave the army without a general; so that Claudius sent thither Aulus Didius, without delay, as propraetor; and notwithstanding all his dispatch, he found affairs in a worse situation than ever, as the Silures had obtained a victory over a legion commanded by Manlius Valens, and elated by this advantage made incursions into the Roman province: however, this loss was in all probability exaggerated by the new general, with a view to enhance the merit of his checking the career of the enemy, whom he compelled to re∣tire.</P>

<P>Mean while Venutius, prince of the Uiccii or Vigantes, inhabiting the counties of Warwick and Worcester, a general of distinguished abilities among the Britons, and formerly attached to the Romans, having married Cartisman∣dua, that perfidious queen of the Brigantes who had betrayed Caratacus, their union was attended with disgust and animosity, which proceeded to a separation and open rupture. A war ensued between the husband and the wife, in the course of which she inveigled his brother and kindred into her power by a fresh act of treachery, which was so flagrant and inexcusable as to excite the resent∣ment of the neighbouring states, some of whom reinforced the party of Venu∣tius. In order to counterballance this junction, Cartismandua had recourse to the assistance of the Romans, whom she had so signally obliged; and Au∣lus Didius being too old or inactive to take the field in person, or unwil∣ling to risque the reputation he had already acquired, sent some cohorts to her succour, and to their valour she owed the fortune of the day; nor had she less cause to congratulate herself upon the assistance of a legion commanded by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit.

<P><PB N="32" REF="410"/>
Elated with the friendship of the Romans, or impatient to gratify an irregu∣lar passion, which perhaps was the cause of her aversion to Venutius, she espoused her own general Vellocatus; an indiscretion which alienated the minds of her subjects to such a degree, that Venutius profited by their dissatisfaction so as to make himself master of a great part of her territories; and though the Romans marched to her succour on the first notice, all they could do was to save her per∣son from captivity; while, in espousing her cause, they converted a serviceable friend into an irreconcileable enemy, and intailed a dangerous war upon the em∣pire.</P>

<P>Didius was succeeded in the government of Britain by Veranius, under the empire of Nero, and meditated mighty projects, which, as he had acquired great reputation in other employments, would probably have succeeded, had they not been anticipated by his death, which happened before he had time to undertake any enterprize of consequence. This officer's place was filled by S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tonius Paulinus, one of the greatest generals of his time, the first Roman who had passed mount Atlas, and penetrated with an army to the banks of the Niger. He glowed with emulation to rival the fame of Corbulo, the conqueror of Armenia, whose glory he resolved to eclipse by his atchievements in Bri∣tain. As soon as he arrived in his government, he formed the design of re∣ducing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of Mona or Anglesey, separated from the rest of Britain by a narrow channel, over which he transported his infantry in flat-bottomed boats,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">The tradition of the country fixes the place near Porthamel in the Parish of Llanidan, where the channel is very narrow; and the Welch name of the landing place and the field of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tle st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll preserve a memo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al of the transac∣tion.

He found the islanders drawn up in order of battle on the shore, to oppose his landing; and saw a number of women, dressed like furies, with dishevelled hair, and torches in their hands, surrounded by Druids, who lifted up their hands to heaven, and poured forth the most terrible execrations. Such a spectacle at first confounded the Romans, and fixed them motionless to the spot, when they received the first assault without opposition: but at length the shame of being terrified by a troop of weak women and priests, together with the exhortations of their general, dispelled the suggestions of their fear, and then charging the Britons sword in hand, they soon made themselves masters of the island. The first use Suetonius made of his victory, was to burn the Druids in the fires which they themselves had kindled for the sacrifice of their prisoners; and in detestation of the barbarities peculiar to the druidical superstition, he order∣ed their altars to be demolished and their sacred groves to be cut down, that no memorial might remain of such an execrable religion. The remnant of the Druids finding themselves deprived of their ceremonies and habitations, and moreover exposed to continual dangers from the aversion of the Romans, retired to Ireland and the Hebrides, which are supposed to have been the original seats of their wor∣ship, while the propraetor began to build forts for the preservation of the island he<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>This work however was soon interrupted, by an unexpected incident. He was recalled to quell a general insurrection of the Britons, in which not only the sub∣jects,
<PB N="33" REF="420"/>
but also the allies of the Romans had joined the other nations that were not subjected to their sway. This revolt was undoubtedly ripened by the sense of the grievances under which the Britons groaned. They had not only lost their antient independency, and form of government, which was so dear to their re∣membrance, but they were saddled with cruel taxes, which they borrowed mo∣ney of the Romans themselves, to pay; and if they failed to reimburse those usurers with the utmost punctuality, their cattle and goods were seized, and themselves expelled from their habitations <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">We are told by Dio Cassius, that Senec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lent incredible sums at extravagant interest to those poor people; and, upon their failure in point of payment, proceeded to such extremities as in a great measure contributed to this re∣volt.</NOTE>. Nay, their misery became the subject of ridicule to their oppressors, who insulted them on all occasions, so as to kindle a desperate spirit of resentment in a people naturally addicted to passion and re∣venge. Their minds being thus prepared, nothing was wanting but some re∣markable outrage, to blow the embers into a dangerous flame of open rebellion; and such a provoking act of violence they now sustained on the following occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Prasatagus, king of the Iceni, lately deceased, had by his will bequeathed his estate, as a joint inheritance between the emperor and his own daughters, in hope that by the sacrifice of one part, he might secure the other to his family: but this precaution, instead of answering the end for which it was taken, had a quite contrary effect; for, the ceremonies of the funeral were no sooner performed, than Catus Decianus, the procurator of the province, took possession of the whole, on pretence of executing the testament of the defunct, and the widow Bonduica making remonstrances against this act of injustice, he ordered her to be scourged like a slave, and violated the chastity of her daughters: the kindred of Prasatagus were treated like slaves, his houses seized, his principalities wasted, and the nobility or chieftains turned out of their paternal estates.</P>
<P>These shocking barbarities, added to the other motives of discontent, exag∣gerated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. Vit. Agric. Dio Cassius.</NOTE> by the dowager, who was a woman of a masculine spirit and irresistible eloquence, and inflamed by the remaining Druids, who had such influence over all the island, produced an universal revolt. The Iceni, as being the most deep∣ly interested in the quarrel, were the first who declared themselves openly; and their example was immediately followed by their neighbours the Trinobantes. Venutius was the next to join the malecontents; the partisans of his wife, for∣getting their particular quarrels, and former amity with the Romans, united with their countrymen on this occasion: all the subjected states, and even the remote Caledonians, engaged in this confederacy; which was headed by Bonduica, who soon found her army increased to two hundred and thirty thousand fighting men; such a prodigious number as they had never brought into the field upon any former emergency.</P>
<P>The Roman colony at Camulodunum was surprized and put to the sword; the temple of Claudius plundered and burnt; the whole infantry of the ninth le∣gion commanded by Petilius Cerealis, surrounded and cut in pieces: and no enemy being able to keep the field against those exasperated enthusiasts, they ra∣vaged the whole country that was subject to the Romans, burning, crucifying, and impaling the wretched people, without distinction of age or sex: they de∣stroyed Verolam, which was a Roman municipium, though not fortified, and

<P>Suetonius, being informed of this rebellion, quitted his designs in the isle of Anglesey, and marching with his small bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of forces through the enemy's country, arrived in safety at London, which was already famous for its wealth and commerce: there being furnished with provision and stores by the Belgic co∣lonies inhabiting the country to the south and west of the Thames, who still ad∣hered to the Roman interest, he drew together the auxiliary cohorts from the neigh∣bouring garrisons that were not tenable; and, though Paenius Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thumius, prae∣fect of the second legion, refused to march to his assistance, these draughts, join∣ed with the fourteenth legion and the vexillarii of the twentieth, composed a bo∣dy of ten thousand men, with which he resolved to take the field, and hazard a general engagement.</P>
<P>With this view he encamped in an advantageous situation; and drawing up his forces in order of battle on a narrow spot of ground, with a thick impene∣trable wood in his rear, and a large open plain in front, he waited with great composure for the attack of the enemy, his legionary soldiers being stationed in the center, flanked on the right and left by the light-armed troops, and the wings being formed by the cavalry.

<P>The Britons defended their liberties with such unwearied obstinacy, even in the midst of the most terrible distresses, and such a number of troops was re∣quired to maintain conquests of greater importance in other parts of Europe, that Nero would have recalled the Roman forces from Britain, at this juncture, had not he been ashamed to give up the only province which had been added to the empire by Claudius, to whom he owed his own elevation. He therefore nominated Turpilianus to the command in Britain, and he could not have pitched upon a more proper person to revive the Roman influence in this island; for, instead of imitating the example of Suetonius, whose severities had rendered him odious to the people, and who was particularly detested on account of his having destroyed the seminary of their laws and religion, he treated them with mildness and humanity; so that their passions subsided, their resentments cooled, and the revolted states returned to their obedience <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Those were the Iceni and their confede∣rates inhabiting the middle parts of the isl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far north as Lincolnshire, and westward to the Severne, through which the procurator Catus had made those roads, canals, and other works described by Dr. Stukely in his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Iter.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>His manner of government gave great satisfaction at Rome, where, when he returned, triumphal honours were decreed to him by the senate: and his successor Trebellius Maximus pursuing the same plan of conduct, the Bri∣tons were gradually reconciled to the laws and customs of the Romans. Ne∣vertheless, he grew in contempt with the soldiers for his inactivity and ava∣rice; and their insolence broke out in tumults, encouraged by Roscius Caelius legate of the twentieth legion: so that the propraetor was forced to compound the matter with the mutineers, who being indulged in all manner of licentious∣ness, allowed him to maintain the shadow of authority, until the beginning of the civil war, in the latter end of Nero's reign; when the auxiliary cohorts and cavalry deserting to Caelius, he was fain to fly for protection to Vitellius, who had assumed the purple in Germany. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Nero being slain during these transactions, Britain enjoyed some re∣pose in the short reigns of Galba and Otho, the troops of this province be∣ing commanded by their several tribunes, among whom Caelius assumed the chief authority. But as soon as Vitellius had established himself on the impe∣rial
<PB N="36" REF="450"/>
throne, he bestowed the command of the army in Britain on Vectius Bola∣nus, who, being little acquainted with the operations of war, allowed the Bri∣tons to live in peace, contenting himself with the affection of his soldiers, which he took pains to conciliate; so that the island enjoyed great tranquility during his government, until he was relieved by Petilius Cerealis, immediately upon Vespasian's accession to the imperial dignity. This officer, during his adminis∣tration, attacked at different times, and as often defeated the Brigantes, who were the most numerous and powerful people in the whole island. And Julius Frontinus, by whom he was succeeded, acquired an equal share of glory in subduing the Silures, who were reckoned the most warlike nation of the Bri∣tons, and almost inaccessible from the nature of their situation.</P>
<P>The contests for the empire among so many competitors, had called off the attention of the Romans from the affairs of Britain; and, as their armies were engaged in more interesting disputes, than could arise from the administration of such a remote province, Venutius had taken this opportunity to revenge his old quarrel, by exciting a revolt among the Brigantes and other nations, who forthwith invaded the Roman province, and met with little opposition, until the arrival of Cerealis, by whom they were entirely reduced; a conquest that concurred with the victories he had before obtained in Gaul and Germany, to raise his character to the highest pinnacle of military reputation. And although Frontinus, might have been expected to make a disadvantageous figure, in coming after such an illustrious general, he supported the dign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the empire with equal capacity, and acquired an equal portion of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in subduing the Silures, who inhabited the forest of Deane, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nties of Hereford and Monmouth.</P>

Immediately before he was appointed to this government, the Ordovices of Denbighshire and Flintshire had surprized and cut in pieces a body of Roman cavalry quartered upon their frontiers; and Agricola no sooner arrived, than he assembled his army, and began his march into the enemy's country. They retired to their mountains, where they thought themselves secure; but, no difficulty could withstand his valour. He made them pay dearly for the petty advantage they had gained, and not only defeated and reduced the Ordovices, but also penetrated into the isle of Anglesey, which Sue∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onius had been constrained to abandon.</P>
<P>On this occasion, being destitute of boats to transport his troops, he ordered his cavalry to swim across the channel; an enterprize which astonished the inhabitants to such a degree, that they submitted without having made the leaft opposition <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are still to be seen the remains of two Roman forts, one of which is called G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iceil, probably from the name of Agricola.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Agricola returning from this glorious expedition, spent the winter in rec∣tifying the disorders that had crept into the administration of the province; in reforming the soldiery, and improving the discipline of the army.

and abundance: so that the nations had cause to rejoice when, upon the death of Vespasian, which happened at this period, his son and successor Titus, who knew his worth and ability, confirmed him in his command. In the be∣ginning of summer he took the field again, directing his march towards the north, where he subdued the Otodini of Northumberland, who had not yet submitted to the Romans; and that he might not lose his summer conquests during the severity of winter, he ordered a chain of forts to be built at proper distances; in which he left garrisons to quell any commotions that might arise, and sustain one another occasionally, in case they should be attacked <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Those castles afterwards constituted the chief strength of Adrian's Vallum, which was no other than a tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch or parapet joining the forts together.

<P>He employed the succeeding winter in making further improvements<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 79<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> on the civil regulations of the province; and, by the elegance of his manners and insinuating address, made such progress in taming the barbarity of the Bri∣tons, that they became enamoured of the Roman arts and magnificence, which they began to imitate with surprising emulation. They raised stately temples, superb porticoes, and public edifices of the Grecian structure; they learned and spoke the Latin language, which they formerly abhorred; they accustomed themselves to wear the Roman toga, and looked upon that as a mark of polite∣ness, which was in effect a badge of their slavery.</P>
<P>In these advances to politeness and effeminacy, they were encouraged and assisted by Agr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cola, who, in the course of a social intercourse with the chiefs and princes, made them acquainted with the comforts and conveniencies of life, to which they had hitherto been strangers: he had previously secured their esteem and confidence by enlisting their vassals, of whom he composed the aux∣iliary cohorts, and giving the command of them to British officers: he persua∣ded them to build public structures for the ornament of their country, and houses more suitable to the dignity of their birth, than those contemptible and inconvenient cabins in which they resided.

<P>In his third campaign, he advanced into the country now called Scot∣land, as far as the river Tay, carrying the terror and novelty of his arms among nations hitherto unknown, who, though his army was exposed to the rage and inclemency of dreadful tempests, never ventured to harrass it in the march; so that they were conquered as soon as discovered; and these conquests secured by forts so advantageously situated, so artfully constructed, and so faithfully maintained, that not even one of them was ever taken, abandoned, or betrayed. They were well supplied with provisions and garrisons, that maintained them through the winter, during which the soldiers made several excursions and ravaged the country; to the inconceivable vexation and even despair of the inha∣bitants, who hoped to gain in one season what they had lost in another.</P>
<P>The succeeding year he employed in extending and still further securing the conquests of the preceding campaign; for, he drove the enemy before him to the western extremities of the island, and fortified the isthmus between the
<PB N="38" REF="470"/>
rivers Forth and Clyde, with a chain of castles, by which the natives were ex∣cluded from the Roman settlements, and as it were confined within the limits of another island.</P>
<P>In the fifth year of his expedition, he penetrated beyond the friths, and em∣barking on board of a fleet equipped for conquest and discovery, sailed along <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he western coast of Scotland, visited several unknown nations, made descents in several places of the highlands, Hebrides, and Orkneys, and, in repeated engage∣ments, defeated the clans who took arms in defence of their country.</P>
<P>At his return from this naval excursion, he quartered his troops in the part f Britain which lies opposite to Ireland, with a view to invade that island, which he hoped to conquer with a very moderate force, in consequence of the infor∣mation he had received from an Irish chief, who having been expelled from his own country, fled to Agricola for refuge: but he was prevented from executing this resolution by the envy and jealousy of Domitian, who had by this time suc∣ceeded Titus on the imperial throne.</P>

<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The sixth campaign of Agricola was of all the most glorious and important. Hearing that the nations on the other side of the Forth were in commotion, he resolved to penetrate to the very northern extremity of the island, and ordered his fleet to keep pace with the march of his army along the shore. He had not proceeded far in this manner, when he understood from the prison∣ers, that the Britons of that country, distinguished by the name of Caledonians, had assembled a vast multitude of armed men, in order to dispute his passage; and that they intended to make irruptions into the lowlands with several dis∣tinct armies, in order to attack the Roman settlements. Cautioned by this intelligence, he divided his forces into three separate bodies, that he might not be surrounded by their numbers, or circumvented by their superior knowledge of the country.</P>
<P>He had like to have suffered severely by this disposition, which was no sooner communicated to the Britons, than they joined their troops again with incredible dispatch; and su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prising in the night the ninth legion, which lay at a distance from the army, cut in pieces the guards, and broke into the camp with incredi∣ble impetuosit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Agricola, apprised of their intention, detached his cavalry on the instant to sustain the legion, and amuse the enemy, until the infantry should arrive: so that, when day broke, the enemy perceiving the succours advancing, would have wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingly retired; but, as they were now engaged in front and rear, they found themselves obliged to maintain the battle, which was fought for some time with equal obstinacy on both sides; till at last the enemy were constrained to fly before the arms and discipline of the Romans; and perhaps that day would have terminated the war, had they not found shelter among their mountains, woods, and mora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, which were unknown and inaccessible to the victors.</P>

<P>They were not disconcerted by this defe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, which they imputed to unforeseen accidents, rather than to the valour of the Romans, and resolved once more to try the fortune of a battle: for this purpose they sent all their wives and children into their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortified towns, and assembled an army superior to that which they had at first brought into the field; but nothing farther was attempted on ei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her side, during the remaining part of the season; and in the winter a Ger∣man cohort, reso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving to return to their own country, seized on two vessels, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but were driven upon the coast of Friesland, where they were en∣slaved.
<PB N="39" REF="480"/>
Soon as the weather would permit Agricola to take the field in the suc∣ceeding spring, he ordered his navy to alarm the coast, while he himself began his march to the Grampian hills; on which he found the enemy posted, to the number of thirty thousand, commanded by their prince Galgacus, who, in a pa∣thetic speech to his people, represented, that situated as they were, at the extre∣mity of the island, they had no resource but their courage, and that victory alone could save them from eternal bondage.</P>
<P>Agricola too judged it expedient to harangue his soldiers, after he had drawn them up in order of battle so as that the confederate Britons in his army should bear the first shock of the enemy's attack; the legions being placed in the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to support this body, in case it should be repulsed. As for the army of Galga∣cus, it was arranged upon the declivity of a hill, which it covered entirely, and the cavalry skirted the plain, with the chariots of war in the front of their line. The Roman general extended his first line to the right and left, that he might not be outflanked by such a multitude; he alighted from his horse and posted himself at the head of the legions. The battle began with showers of javelins, which did but little execution on either side, though the Britons at this distance enjoyed an advantage, which they could not expect to maintain in close fight, with their small targets and long pointless swords, against the offensive and defensive arms of the legionary soldiers. Agricola therefore detached four cohorts of Batavians and Thuringians to attack them sword in hand; these springing for∣wards with great celerity, employed their short pointed swords against the naked bodies of the islanders, in such a manner, that a great number fell dead on the spot, and the enemy began to fall into confusion. The rest of the Roman ar∣my profiting by this disorder, advanced immediately to the attack, and falling among them with great impetuosity, a terrible slaughter ensued; while the cha∣riots were rendered useless by the unevenness of the ground. The British infan∣try, posted upon the brow of the hill, made a motion to attack the Romans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who were by this time dispersed in the pursuit of those they had already routed; but, Agricola perceiving their design, ordered part of his cavalry to advance and keep them in awe, and the rest of his troops in the mean time completed the victory. Now a dreadful scene ensued. The wings were ordered to close and flank the Caledonians on both sides; then the carnage and confusion redoubled. They endeavoured to fly; but finding themselves enclosed on every side, threw down their arms and rushed upon the swords of the Romans: the ground was strewed with the mangled bodies of the dead and dying, and overflowed with the blood of those that fell: yet, even in this extremity, the Britons did not fail to exhibit proofs of valour and recollection; for as they were repulsed to the neigbouring woods, they rallied in small bodies, and fell upon those who were too eager in the pursuit. They made several efforts of this nature; till Galgacus, finding it impossible to restore the battle, retired with the remains of his army, leaving ten thousand men, that lay dead on the field; whereas the Romans lost but three hundred and forty. The fortune of this day was celebrated on one side in shouts of joy, with which the Roman camp resounded through the night; and on the other, bewailed with dismal yells and lamentations that ecchoed from the mountain, while they examined the particulars of their loss, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owled over their dead countrymen, and endeavoured to carry off their wounded princes. Yet the darkness facilitated the retreat of the vanquished, in which they
<PB N="40" REF="490"/>
used such diligence, that before day light there was not one to be seen; a gloomy silence reigned over the neigbouring hills; and distant clouds of smoke issu∣ed from the Caledonian villages, which they themselves had burned in the first transports of their despair; nay, to such a pitch of horror and frenzy did this prevail, that many chieftains massacred their own wives and children, that they might not be exposed to the miseries of want, or be violated and enslaved by the insulting Romans.</P>

<P>ALL the inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Britain were not yet reconciled to the domi∣nion of the Romans. Some even of the southern parts detesting the manners of their conquerors, who loaded them with grievous taxes, and trans∣ported the greatest part of their youth to fight their battles in other parts of the
<PB N="42" REF="510"/>
world, chose rather to forsake their native possessions, than maintain them on such servile terms; and accordingly a great number of them retired beyond the friths, where they lived independent, though poor, among the Caledonians, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined them in the sequel, when they made such dreadful irruptions into the Ro∣man province, and ravaged the lands of their countrymen with fire and sword.</P>
<P>Their first exploit of this kind was performed in the first year of Adrian's reign; on which occasion they surprized and demol shed some of the forts which Agricola had built on the Ifthmus, and returned to their native hills laden with boory. The emperor being informed of this commotion, conferred the govern∣ment of Britain upon Julius Severus, who was immediately recalled to be em∣ployed elsewhere; and as the Caledonians continued their incursions, the emperor resolved to go thither in person, and tame the insolence of those ferocious islanders, who could not be persuaded to live in peace.</P>
<P>After he had landed in Britain, and proceeded as far as York, he met with some old officers who had served under Agricola; and these gave him such an unfavourable account of the country which he intended to subdue, that he laid aside the design of penetrating into a savage country, covered with impassible woods, mountains, and morasses, the conquest of which would be attended with great difficulty and danger, and at last yield neither glory nor advantage. He exercised his sagacity and reflection in contriving measures for preserving the peace of the province; and judging that the irruptions of the Caledo∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, or Picts, proceeded from their being hampered for want of room, in such a narrow corner of the island, he ordered the castles between the friths to be abandoned, and contracted the Roman province within the other line of forts built aiso by Agricola, from Solway frith to the river Tyne. It was upon this occasion, as we have already hinted, that he raised a strong rampart of earth connecting these forts, extending ninety miles across the island from east to west. The southern parts being thus secured from insult, and the Caledonians indulged with plenty of ground, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Restorer of Britain, as we learn from some medals struck on that occasion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

These tidings being reported at Rome, the new emperor, Antoninus Pius, bestowed the command in Britain on Lollius Urbicus, who not only drove the enemy out of the northern parts of England, but even repelled them beyond the limits within which they had been confined by Agri∣cola: he raised a fortification almost in the same line, from frith to frith, and hard by established a strong camp, in which he kept a body of forces to de∣send the wall and defeat the attempts of the Caledonians.

<P>Marcus Aurelius being succeeded by his son Commodus, a flagitious wretch, unworthy of such a father, the management of affairs fell into the hands of worthless pimps and parasites, who, laying aside the officers of abi∣lity and integrity, who had served the late emperor, conferred posts and go∣vernments upon profligate persons of their own stamp, who had become neces∣sary instruments in their debauches, or purchased their promotion with extrava∣gant sums of money; for which they indemnified themselves by fleecing the people subjected to their government. Such preposterous conduct could not fail of being attended with a relaxation of discipline in the army, and disorder and dis∣content in the provinces; of which the Caledonians taking advantage, assembled a strong body of forces, broke through the wall of Antoninus, cut off the Ro∣man general and all his troops, and filled the whole country with terror and de∣vastation. Commodus, alarmed at the ravages and success of those indomitable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dio. l. 72.</NOTE> barbarians, appointed Ulpius Marcellus propraetor in Britain; and this com∣mander being a person of uncorrupted morals, experience in the art of war, undaunted courage, and indefatigable vigilance, soon restored the troops to their ancient discipline by his example and severity; and defeated the Caledonians in se∣veral engagements with great slaughter, by which they were so weakened and inti∣midated, that they did not attempt another invasion during the remaining part of this emperor's reign. But the glory he acquired in this expedition, had like to have cost him his life, through the envy and jealousy of his master, who assumed the title of Britannicus on account of the victory the propraetor had won; and re∣calling him from his government, sold his place to the best bidder. This in all probability was some low-born miscreant, without weight or authority, who allowed the solders to live according to their own pleasure, regardless of disci∣pline and res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, until, under a succession of these commanders, they degene∣rated to such a degree of licentiousness, that a mutiny ensued. A deputation
<PB N="44" REF="530"/>
of fifteen hundred being sent to Rome with complaints against the administra∣tion, struck such a terror into the heart of Commodus, that he sacrificed Peren∣nis, the commander of his praetorian guards, to appease their dangerous cla∣mour; and bestowed the command of the province upon Pertinax, who after∣wards ascended the imperial throne.</P>
<P>Even this propraetor, with all his great talents, found it almost impracticable to reduce them to order and obedience; for, when he attempted to exert his authority, one of the mutinous legions took to their arms, and a tumult ensued, in which a great deal of blood was split, and Pertinax himself left for dead upon the spot. Notwithstanding this miscarriage in the beginning, he afterwards employed his industry and address to such good purpose, that he effected a reformation; and although he made some severe examples of the most seditious among them, be∣came a favourite with the army. Yet, he found such difficulty in conquering their aversion to exact discipline, that he desired to be recalled, and having at length obtained his request, was succeeded by Clodius Albinus, who, though commanded to resign his office to Junius Severus, because he had given offence<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> in a speech he made to the army, on a false report of the emperor's death, re∣fused to part with the government, and continued in possession of it at the death of Commodus, who was soon after murdered in his own palace.</P>
<P>It was at this period that Pertinax assumed the imperial purple; and all good men rejoiced at his elevation, inasmuch as his great abilities, and unblemished character, promised a wife, mild, and happy administration: nor would he have disappointed the expectation of his subjects, had he lived to exert those ta∣lents and virtues by which his character was distinguished; for this very reason his elevation could not but give disgust to those who knew their conduct would not stand the test of inquiry. This was the case with the praetorian troops, who not only expected to be punished for their licentiousness, but also dreaded the prospect of a reformation, which in order to avert they murdered the new em∣peror, at the immediate instigation of Didius Julianus, to whom they sold the imperial dignity. Perhaps this person, who had no other pretensions than his wealth, would not have presumed to attempt such a purchase, unless he had been encouraged with the promise of support, by Albinus, who now command∣ed in Britain, and looked upon Pertinax as his enemy.</P>

<P>Didius was no sooner proclaimed emperor, than he found himself une∣qual to the task of managing such an unweildy purchase. His person and go∣vernment were treated with universal contempt; and the arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es that served in the distant provinces, incensed at the presumption of the praetorian band, who had raised him to the throne without their knowledge and concurrence, desired their own generals to assume the imperial purple. It was in consequence of such im∣portunities that C. Pes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ennius Niger declared himself emperor in the east, and Septimius Severus put on the imperial ensigns in Illyria. He had an advantage over his competitor in being near the capital, whither he marched without de∣lay, and was acknowledged by the senate, which had, upon his approach, given ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs for putting Didius to death. But he did not think himself secure on the throne wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Niger lived, and Albinus maintained such influence among the legi∣ons of Britain. The last therefore, he cajoled with promises of sharing the empire with him, and in the mean time permitted him to enjoy the badges and distinc∣tions
<PB N="45" REF="540"/>
of his associate, until Niger was defeated and slain; then he revolved dif∣ferent expedients for disengaging himself from Albinus, whose promotion stood in the way of his own family. No method seemed more effectual and expedi∣tious than that of poison, which he hired some assassins to administer: but Al∣binus being apprised of their design, extorted from them a confession with the rack, and being convinced of his colleague's treachery, declared war against Se∣verus, and assumed the title of emperor and Augustus. Conscious of his own strength and influence, he forthwith crossed the sea, and gained the army on the Rhine over to his party; while Severus advanced at the head of his troops to de∣cide the contention by force of arms: these two powerful rivals meeting in a large plain near Lyons in Gaul, a terrible battle ensued, and continued a long time with doubtful success, the British troops having charged with such impetuosity in the beginning, that Severus had like to have been worsted; but his general<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Severus was no sooner rendered by this decisive action sole master of the empire, than he dispatched Virius Lupus into Britain, with the title of proprae∣tor, to repel the Caledonians, who had made incursions even beyond Adrian's wall, during the absence of the legions which had been transported to the con∣tinent by Albinus. Mean while the emperor himself remained in Gaul, where, among other regulations, he divided the government of Britain into two pro∣vinces. Lupus on his arrival finding the province in the utmost distress, and the Caledonians very powerful, in consequence of their being joined by the Meatae, who inhabited the district between the walls of Antoninus and Adrian, he did not choose to depend upon the hazard of war, but, on pretence of redeeming the captives, purchased a peace from the barbarians. This treaty remained in full force and unviolated for several years, till at length, the northern Britons, tired of inaction, which might blunt their martial genius, or stimulated by wants which they could supply by rapine only, made an irruption into the Roman pro∣vince, with such numbers and impetuosity, that the propraetors, after having joined their forces and made divers unsuccessful efforts to stem the torrent, were obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o send to Rome for fresh reinforcements.</P>

<P>Severus, alarmed at the distress of Britain, which was considered as the most important province of the empire, resolved to go thither in person; and, assembling an army without delay, set out on the expedition, in his declining age, when he was so crippled with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, that he was obliged to be carried in a litter; and that he might be able to surmount every obstacle that could re∣tard the entire conquest of the island, he not only provided a strong army of ve∣teran troops, but on his arrival in Britain, he likewise prepared pontoons to be laid over morasses, and other military machines for clearing woods, opening roads, and rendering mountains accessible; so that the enemy should no lon∣ger avail themselves of the fastnesses to which they usually retired from the pur∣suit of their conquerors.</P>

of affairs in South Britain, to the care of his younger son Geta, resolving that the eldest should attend him in the expedition.</P>
<P>These previous measures being taken, he began his march, and advancing to∣wards Adrian's rampart, found the whole country desolated by the enemy; a circumstance that did not fail to corroborate the resolution he had already taken, to merit and assume the glorious title of Britannicus, which had attractions su∣perior to all the glory he had acquired, and was in all appearance the chief mo∣tive that induced him to undertake the conquest of such a warlike people, in spite of the dangers of the campaign, and the infirmities of old age, under which he laboured. As he penetrated into the country of the Caledonians, he employed his pioneers in laying it open; and indeed he could not use too much precaution of this kind against the efforts of those northern Britons, who wisely avoided general actions with such an invincible army, but seized all opportuni∣ties of harrassing them in their march, and cutting off small parties that straggled in quest of forage or plunder. They followed the maxims of Cassivelaunus, who allured the Roman soldiers into bogs, thickets, and narrow passes, after droves of cattle assembled for the purpose, and then fell upon them by surprize with in∣credible fury, after having cut off their communication with the army: in all probability these Caledonians were originally of the same race of Britons over whom that prince had reigned. They were armed and painted in the same man∣ner: nor do they seem to have degenerated in point of courage and fortitude; for they were accustomed to swim through marshes, lakes, and rivers; they ex∣posed themselves voluntarily to the most imminent dangers. They exerted their industry and valour to such a degree, in multiplying the perils and hardships of their invaders, that numbers of the Roman soldiers, fatigued with hard duty, and distracted with continual alarms, intreated their comrades to put an end to their miserable lives, left they should fall into the hands of such a savage enemy; and Severus is said to have lost fifty thousand men in this expedition <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nians were in all probability rendered more hardy than their southern pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors, by the extreme cold and poverty of the country which they inhabited.

<P>Notwithstanding all these difficulties, losses, and mortifications, Seve∣rus pursued his purpose with incredible resolution, until he had made his way to the most northern extremity of the island; and then he granted peace to the enemy, which they were glad to accept on the terms that he was pleased to pro∣pose. Whatever the articles of this pacification may have been, certain it is they submitted to the Roman empire; and Severus, not yet satisfied of their sin∣cerity

and faith, ordered a new wall to be built across the Roman province, so near the rampart raised by Adrian, that some authors imagine the first served as a foundation to the other. It was strengthened by castella built within less than a mile of each other, four small turrets between every two castella, a deep ditch to the north, and extended sixty-eight miles from Segedunum or Cousin's house on the river Tyne to Timocelum or Boulness near Carlisle. Severus be∣ing by this time almost overwhelmed with infirmities, retired to York, leav∣ing his son Antoninus, afterwards surnamed Caracalla, to superintend this work, and take the command of the army; and this prince, who was a youth of profli∣gate morals, and had been more than once engaged in conspiracies against his father's life, made such an arbitrary use of his authority, and treated the lately<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 208.</NOTE> pacified North Britons with such insolence and cruelty, as provoked them to re∣nounce the peace, and take arms once more against the Romans. A revolt which incensed the old emperor to such a pitch of indignation, that ordering himself to be carried immediately to the camp, he harrangued the soldiers upon the inconstancy and perfidy of those barbarians, whom, in a verse of Homer, he exhorted them to extirpate, without even sparing the child in the mother's womb. Having thus inflamed their resentment, he invested Caracalla with the command of this expedition; while he himself returned to York, where in a little time he ended his days. With respect to the war, his orders were very ill executed by Caracalla, who was more intent upon courting the favour of the army than in annoying the enemy; for, being persuaded that his father was already on the verge of the grave, he had begun to form a party against his brother Geta. Nor was he disappointed in his expectation touching the old emperor, the news of whose death no sooner reached him, than he renewed the peace with the Caledo∣nians and Meatae; and having received hostages for the performance of articles, retired into the Roman province.</P>
<P>Severus bequeathed the empire to his two sons, though Caracalla's great ambi∣tion was to reign alone, and all his efforts were directed to this aim, which how∣ever he could not accomplish, at this period: the will of the old emperor was religiously obeyed: the soldiers took the oath of fidelity to Bassianus (afterwards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>From the departure of these two princes, there is a melancholy<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

From these, it appears that in the reign of Gordian III. Maecilius Fuscus com∣manded in this island, where he repaired the barracks and arsenals which had fallen to decay; that in two years after this event, Cneius Lucilianus the pro∣praetor built a bath, with an exchange or portico; and that Nonius Philippus was governor of the British province, in the year that preceded the death of the emperor Gordian. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. Cumb.</NOTE></P>
<P>These are all the particulars relating to the history of England, which are to be collected from the reign of Caracalla to that of Publius Licinius Galienus,
<PB N="48" REF="570"/>
in whose time thirty tyrants sprung from the corruption of his government. Six of these, namely Lol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anus, Victorianus, Posthumus the elder, Tetricus the younger, and Marius, seem to have declared for themselves in this island; at least the number of their coins found in the neighbourhood of Colchester, en∣courage this conjecture; and Porphyry the philosopher, who lived in those times, calls Britain a soil fruitful in tyrants. The peace of this island might have been restored by Marcus Aurelius Flavius Claudius, the successor of Galienus, had not he been suddenly overtaken by death, in the midst of his preparations for reducing Tetricus, who at that time ruled the western provinces, and in all probability was in possession of Britain. From his death we are acquainted with no British occurrence for a series of seventeen years; till the reign of Probus, during which the imperial purple was assumed by Proculus and Bonosus (said to be a Briton) who laid claim to this island, Spain, and Gaul, and seem to have been abetted by the natives of this country; but, their pretensions soon vanish∣ed before the fortune of Probus, who (we are told by Vopiscus) permitted the Britons to cultivate the grape and make wine. But Bonosus was not the only person who raised disturbances in Britain during the life of this emperor. Another propraetor, whose name is not ascertained, having been recommended to the government of this island, by Victorinus Maurus, prime-minister and ge∣neral in chief to Probus, renounced his allegiance, and set up for himself; when<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Carus, who succeeded to the imperial purple, associated his two sons Carinus and Numerianus, to the first of whom he assigned Britain and other provinces, which were grievously oppressed by that monster of impurity; though he soon gave way to the fortune of Dioclesian, a brave and active prince, who admitted Maximian to a share of the empire.</P>

<P>In the reign of these colleagues, Carausius, a man of mean paren∣tage, by birth a Menapian, or as others affirm a Batavian, having distinguish∣ed himself for his bravery and military skill, obtained the command of the Ro∣man navy stationed at Boulogne to guard the seas against the piracies and ra∣vages of the Franks and Saxons, who about that time infested the coasts of Gaul. Though he took a number of prizes while he exercised this office, he neither made restitution to the Roman subjects, who had been plundered, nor remitted any part of the booty to the emperor's treasury; nay it was observed, that he never attacked the pyrates, until after they had plundered the coasts, and then be intercepted them when they were laden with the spoils of the count∣ry. On <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount of this conduct and the great wealth he had amassed, which gave room to suspect him of harbouring more dangerous designs, Maximian Herculius gave orders for apprehending and executing him without delay; but Carausius being apprised of the emperor's intention, secured the fleet in his interest, and sailed for Britain, where he was joyfully received and proclaimed emperor by the provincial troops, consisting of one legion and some auxiliary co∣horts; a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re proof of the peace and tranquillity that prevailed throughout the whole is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and: and this favourable reception put him in immediate possession of the whole Roman province, as far as the wall of Antoninus, which he repaired

and augmented. The next measure he took was to conclude an alliance with those Franks and Saxons, against whom he had formerly acted as admiral: he enlisted a number of their troops, increased his fleet with a great addition of stout ships, and being master of Boulogne, supplied it with a good garrison and all manner of necessaries, to endure a siege with which it was threatened<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.

<P>As the peace between the emperors and Carausius, was the result of necessity, the troubles of Aegypt being appeased, and the Parthian and African wars finished, Dioclesian and Maximian Herculius conferred the dignity of Caesar upon their adopted heirs Maximian Galerus and Constantius Chloris, who married their daughters, and then divided the empire into four departments. The share of Constantius comprehending all the provinces on this side of the Alps, he appeared before Boulogne almost as soon as the news of his elevation had reached the place; and having reduced the town, marched against the Franks, Cauci, and Frisians, who were in alliance with Carausius, whom he could not attack in Britain for want of a navy. These nations he subdued and transplanted into remote countries, that they might not be near enough to obstruct the exe∣cution of the plan he had formed, for which a number of ships were then build∣ing under his own immediate direction.

Those who escaped the carnage in this place, retired to London, with a view to pillage that city, from which they might be transported to the continent in their own ships that still kept the sea; but their design was frustrated by part of the Roman navy, which entering the river Thames, put them all to the sword. Mean while Constantius was received as a deliverer by the Britons, who had groaned under the tyranny of Alectus; and upon this oc∣casion he had a glorious opportunity of exerting his clemency, justice, and discretion.</P>

Howsoever this island might have suffered in other respects from the tyranny of Carausius, certain it is, the arts had flourished during his usurpation; the country was embellished with magnificent structures, and the city of London, already considerable for its extent, beauty, and riches: so that Constantius pitched upon Britain as the place of his residence; perhaps he was on this occasion influenced by his passion for the celebrated Helena mother of Constantine, and according to some authors a native of Colchester, while others affirm she was the daughter of Coil, king of the Cumbrian Britons, inha∣biting the countries between the walls of Severus and Antoninus.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been her family or country, she was certainly a Briton and a woman of rare accomplishments, who had long ago captivated the heart of Constantius, with whom she was united in the bands of wedlock, though he had for reasons of state been obliged to repudiate her, on his marriage with Theodora daughter of Maximian Herculius, to whom he owed his elevation <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">What seems to have mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed some authors, who say, Helena was the concubine of Con∣stantius, was the law that<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>preva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led among the Romans, prohibiting all citizens marrying fo∣reigners of what rank or degree s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever; and every person was deemed a foreigner who had not been admitted to the jus quiriti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m et civitacis; which was the case of the Latins and other Italian n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, before they were naturalised by the Julian law.

and other liberalities, acquired the love and veneration of the Britons to such a degree, that their esteem amounted almost to adoration. Such a companion could not fail to compleat the happiness of Constantius, whose equitable and wise administration was productive of peace and tranquillity to his subjects; and accordingly Britain enjoyed uninterrupted repose 'till his death, which happened at York, the place of his residence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>His son Constantine no sooner heard of his father's indisposition, than he artfully escaped from Rome, where he had been detained by the jealousy of the other emperors, and arrived at York to perform the last offices to Con∣stantius, who declared him his heir and successor in the empire: and this dispo∣sition was so agreeable to the army, that they proclaimed him emperor immedi∣ately after his father's decease.</P>
<P>His first care, upon his accession to the throne, was to repel the Picts and Scots, who never failed to make incursions upon the Roman province, when they thought the imperial dignity usurped or unsettled by vacancies, fac∣tions, or foreign disputes; and those nations being punished and reduced, he raised a considerable army to maintain his pretensions on the continent against Maxentius, who had assumed the purple, and was actually in possession of Rome. The necessary preparations being made, he transported his forces to Gaul, where he conquered the Franks, who had by this time communicated their name to that country; then marching into Italy at the head of ninety thousand cavalry, and fourscore thousand foot, gave battle to Maxentius, who was defeated and slain.</P>
<P>Being now in possession of the empire without a rival, he publicly em∣braced the Christian Religion, which he had long espoused in private; and his declaration on this subject was in all probability promoted by the ardour of the British troops, the majority of whom were proselytes to the doctrines of Christianity, which now began to flourish in the conversion of a Roman emperor, who would have done honour to any religion he had professed. He possessed the talents of a Julius, and the liberality of a Titus. He was brave, affable, elegant, equitable, and humane; and so generous, that he often indemnified from his own purse, those very people who had suffered from the impartial admini∣stration of justice. Far from sullying by examples of severity the glory of the victory obtained over Maxentius, he with a magnanimity peculiar to him∣self, pardoned all who had fought against him, and restored the forfeited estates of his most rancorous enemies: he recalled those who had been exiled by Maxentius, re-established the senate in its antient splendour and authority, and made such wise and effectual regulations to secure the peace and tranquillity of Rome, that in the inscriptions dedicated to his honour he was styled the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eutrop.

History is silent as to the management of this war: but, in a little time he forfeited all the reputation he had acquired. His vices subjected him to the contempt and detestation of his subjects, and he was deprived of his crown and life by Magnentius, a Gaul of British extraction, who presumed to appropriate the imperial ensigns to himself, notwithstanding the claim of Constantius, now the sole surviving son of Constantine the great. But the party of this young prince prevailing, after a struggle of three years, the usurper put an end to his own life at Lyons; and the whole province of Bri∣tain acknowledged the authority of the victor, who made a very base and impo∣litic use of his good fortune.</P>

As he dreaded nothing more than such a representation, he endeavoured to in∣veigie the generous Roman into the appearance of a crime, and then ordered him to be put in fetters by virtue of the imperial commission; an indignity, which the other resented to such a degree, that he drew his sword and made a thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st at the Spaniard, but missing his aim, turned the point on himself, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lunged the weapon into his own bosom.

<P>Yet even this domestic oppression did not produce any disturbance in Britain, or hinder the Romans from enjoying the advantage of such a fertile province: for, in one year, they transported quantities of corn sufficient to sup∣ply their armies and garrisons in Germany; Gaul being too much wasted by con∣tinual wars, to furnish provision for such a number of forces.

Nevertheless, Julian, afterwards surnamed the Apostate, who at that time possessed the government of Gaul, as the adopted Caesar of Constantius, re∣solved to bridle the ferocity of those northern nations, and for that purpose sent over Lupicinus, an officer of courage and experience, though rough and haughty in his disposition, with a reinforcement of light-armed cohorts com∣posed of Heruli, Batavi, and Maesians. Perhaps his chief design in dismissing Lupicinus on this expedition, was to free himself from a man, whom he consi∣dered as a spy planted upon him by Constantius, who, by this time, was jea∣lous of Julian, suspecting, not without reason, that he wanted to ingratiate himself with the army, so as it should declare him emperor; a conjecture justi∣fied by the subsequent conduct of Julian, who, after the departure of Lupicinus, assumed the purple, and dispatched an officer to Boulogne to prevent the news of this step from being conveyed to Britain; and the vicar actually returned from Gaul, after having secured the province, before he received the least intelligence of this affair. As for the weak, indolent Constantius, he was engaged in a war with Persia, which he could not quit, until the enemy retired into their own country; then leaving garrisons in the frontier places, he marched towards Thrace, in order to oppose the usurpation of Julian, by whose procurement he is said to have been poisoned in Cilicia. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 361.</NOTE></P>

<P>This usurper, with all his learning and enterprizing genius, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 364.</NOTE> wilful and headstrong, and at length fell a sacrifice to his own temerity; for in attempting to carry the war into the heart of Persia, where he could not be sup∣plied with provisions, he lost his own life, and exposed his army to the most im∣minent danger of perishing by want, which would really have been their fate, had not his successor Jovian redeemed them from destruction, by giving up the provinces and fortified towns that served as a barrier on that side of the empire. His authority, however, was of very short duration; for he died at Dadastene in Bithynia, on his return to Constantinople, and was succeeded by Valentinian, in whose reign the Roman province in Britain was reduced to the verge of ruin, by the invasion and ravages of its northern neighbours <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Among those people, who at this period sell upon the Roman province, Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llinus mentions the Attacotti, who have been the sub∣ject of much dispute and conjecture.—After all that has been said by Bucha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an and the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot∣tish writers in favour of the antiquity of their nation, it does not appear that the Scots had as yet any established monarchy in Britain, from any of the Greek or Latin authors, who have so accurately described the expeditions u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dertaken and executed by the greatest captai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of ant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t northern extremities of the island.

<P>Valentinian was no sooner made acquainted with this disaster, than he sent Severus, the steward of his houshold, to reform the abuses which had crept into the administration in Britain, and been productive of such dangerous commotions: but this officer's endeavours proving ineffectual, he was recalled, and succeeded by Jovinus, who finding it impracticable to restore the quiet of the province, without a force sufficient to secure it from the insults of the enemy, desired that a strong army might be sent over, without delay, as the only expe∣dient that could save it from ruin. In consequence of this representation, corro∣borated with other accounts describing the deplorable situation of this impor∣tant province, the emperor bestowed the government of it upon Theodosius, a general of great experience and constant success in war, who was dispatched with a choice body of Roman and auxiliary forces. At his arrival in London, he found the country wasted and over-run by the Franks and Saxons, who had landed on the coast opposite to Gaul, and were now dispersed in small bodies, plundering and burning the villages and plantations: he forthwith divided his troops into small detachments, and falling upon those free-boot∣ers encumbered with pillage, routed and cut them in pieces, before they had time to re-assemble; then restoring the spoil to the right owners, returned in triumph to London, were he was received as an hero and deliverer.</P>

<P>As those he had vanquished were only the allies of the nations which this province chiefly dreaded, he resolved to make preparations for an expedition against the Caledonians; and in the mean time endeavoured, by private emissa∣ries, to sow the seeds of dissension between them and the Attacotti or Silures.
<PB N="55" REF="640"/>
When he enquired into the administration of the province, he was not at all sur∣prized to find discontent and disaffection among the people: he therefore pro∣mised a speedy redress of grievances; he published a general amnesty and par∣don to all the revolters who should repair to his standard; sent for a celebrated justiciary to preside in the civil magistracy, and appointed Dulcitius, a comman∣der of great reputation, as his lieutenant in the field. These precautions being taken he advanced against the Caledonians, who had overspread the northern parts of the province like a deluge, defeated them in several encounters, drove them before him into their own country, repaired and rebuilt the forts and castles they had damaged and demolished, and by convincing them of his supe∣riority over them in the arts and operations of war, paved the way for an honour∣able and lasting peace.</P>
<P>In the midst of all his glory and success, he had well nigh fallen a sacrifice to a conspiracy hatched by one Valentinus, a native of Pannonia, who had been, for his turbulent spirit and desperate ambition, banished to Britain, which was at that time a general place of exile; there associating with outlaws of the same stamp, he formed the design of seizing the government, and had already de∣bauched a good number of soldiers from their allegiance.</P>

<P>Theodosius being informed of these machinations, ordered the ring∣leaders to be apprehended and delivered into the hands of justice; and these being executed, he exhibited a noble proof of his moderation and sagacity, in sup∣pressing all further enquiry concerning the accomplices; which might have pro∣duced dangerous convulsions, at a time when his master's authority was far from being established in this island.</P>
<P>Having preserved the public tranquility by this prudent method of proceed∣ing, he was left at liberty to provide for the security of the barrier: he repaired the walls, repeopled the cities, reinforced the garrisons, and restored the an∣tient discipline of the army. The country lying between the walls of Severus and Lollius Urbicus, he erected into a separate province, which was denominated Valentia, after the reigning emperor, and ruled by a distinct deputy; and lastly, he punished an order of men called Areani, who though instituted to give no∣tice of the enemies motions, had lately acted as spies for the barbarians. The peace and security of the Roman government being thus re-established, he re∣turned to the continent, and was received by the emperor with all the honours due to his merit and services; which the senate likewise acknowledged, by de∣creeing a statue to be erected to his memory, and placed among those of their most illustrious ancestors.</P>
<P>Though we do not know the particular methods he took to accomplish those great ends, we are assured by Claudian, and Latinus Pacatus Drepanius, in his panegyric upon this great man, that he prevailed upon Valentinian to lighten the exorbitant tribute which had been imposed upon the Britons; and equipped a powerful navy, with which he maintained the empire of the sea, and in parti∣cular<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panegyr. Theod. Zo∣sym. 1. 4.</NOTE> scoured the German and Hyperborean oceans of those Saxon fleets, which had done such mischief on almost all the coasts of Europe.</P>
<P>Britain, thus secured from external insults, and settled within herself on an hap∣py footing, by the wise regulations of Theodosius, enjoyed some years of peace and felicity, until ambition intervened to disturb her quiet, and she laid the foundation of her own ruin, by espousing the cause of an usurper.</P>

<P>All the Scottish historians describe this revolution; which (if it really happened seems much more likely to have been effected by Theodosius, than by this Maximus, whose residence in Britain, after he had assumed the purple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of too short a duration, to justify the supposition of having brought about such a remarkable event.

For this purpose he raised a con∣siderable army of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itons, joined to the Roman forces withdrawn from the bar∣rier; and embarking them on board of his fleet, set sail for the mouth of the Rhine, where he was immediately joined by the legions quartered in that neighbourhood, and his title acknowledged by all the Roman troops in Germany. In all probability he would not have found himself in a condition to support his pretensiors, by means of such a British army, had not he recommended himself to the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>abitants of this island, in an especial manner, by espousing Helena, the daughter of Cadvan, a considerable chieftain of North-Wales; an alliance<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> by which he acquired the interest of her relations, who hoped, in his son Victor, once m re to see a prince of British blood upon the imperial throne.</P>

<P>That prince, far from being intimidated by his threats and success, advanced against him with an army of veterans, accustomed to conquer under his command, defeated him in two pitched battles, and taking him near Aquileia, caused him to be put to death, after he had five years usurped the imperial dig∣nity. Then he reversed and annulled all the edicts published, and honours con∣ferred by Maximus; and restored Valentinian to the imperial sovereignty of the western empire. Andragathius, who commanded a fleet in the Mediterranean, no sooner received the news of these events, than he threw himself over-board in despair: Victor, who had been declared Caesar, and resided in Gaul, was slain by Arbogastes, and the British forces, left for the security of his person and go∣vernment, retired to the sea-coast, and settled in Armorica, which is now known by the name of Bretagne<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">This settlement, concerning which the Greek and Latin authors are silent, is mentioned by Carte, on the testimony of a British writer called Lhowarch Hen, prince of Cumberland, who lived within 140<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years of this period.</NOTE>.

<P>His first care was to raise a strong body of the natives, for the security of the kingdom against the inroads of the barbarians; and had he confined his sway within the limits of the province, he might have reigned with great tranquillity and reputation; but, his ambition overleaped such narrow boundaries, and he resolved to make himself master of the whole western empire: for this purpose, he, in imitation of Constantius, whom he resembled in character and fortune, enrolled in his army all the British youth that were able to carry arms, and landing with them at Boulogne, had the pleasure to see his cause espoused by all the imperial forces in Gaul and Germany.

But, the Roman empire on the continent, being by this time overspread with an inundation of barbarous people from the north, the emperor could not afford to leave any part of his troops in Britain; and Gallio was recalled immedi∣ately after he had repulsed the enemy.

XXXI. Before we close this important period of the British history, we shall give a suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inct detail of the progress which the Christian religion had made from its first dawn in this island to the present time, when the country was finally abandoned by the Romans. As for the account given by William of Malmesbury, concerning the translation of Joseph of Arimathea to the church of Glassenbury, it bears such palpable marks of imposture, that we shall reject it as a monkish fable, unworthy of refutation. Nevertheless, that the seeds of Chris∣tianity were sown in Britain, even in the most early age of the church, appears from the testimony of Eusebius, an inquisitive writer, in great credit with the first emperor Constantine. He positively says that the apostles crossed the ocean, and arrived at the British isles; and Theodoret, who was a bishop in the fifth century, expressly mentions the Britons as a people whom St. Paul converted to Christianity. An assertion that seems to be justified by Clemens Romanus contemporary with the apostles, who gives us to understand that St. Paul preach∣ed to the utmost bounds of the west, the common expression applied in those times to the British islands. Whether this great propagator of the gospel was ever personally in this country, or (which is more probable) sent hither some of his disciples to preach the doctrines of his master, we may fairly conclude, that this religion had gained a number of proselytes, as early as the defeat of Bon∣duica
<PB N="61" REF="700"/>
by Suetonius; for, Pomponia Graecina, wife of Aulus Plautius the legate of Claudius, had embraced it, and (as we are informed by Tacitus) was accused of foreign superstition. The example of a lady in such distinguished rank professing a religion so pure and benevolent, could hardly fail to extend the doc∣trine among the Britons, who were noted alike for innocence and docility. Nor was this in all likelihood the only fair patroness of this religion in Britain; for, there is great reason to believe that the Claudia mentioned by St. Paul in his epistles, was the same British lady afterwards celebrated by the poet Martial; inasmuch as the apostle, in his second epistle to Timothy, takes notice of Claudia and Pudeus: and Martial names this very Pudeus as the husband of Claudia Rufina.</P>
<P>These, however, were only private converts to a new doctrine, which was not yet in a condition to cope with the established religion of the country; and tho' Tertullian, who flourished in the reign of Caracalla, says that christianity had made its way into Britain, we are not to suppose the country in general was con∣verted; for we learn from Xiphilin, that the promiscuous use of venery still prevailed among the better sort of the inhabitants <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The wife of a British prince named Argen∣tocoxus, being rallied by the empress Julia, about the libertinism of the ladies in Britain, who granted favours promiseuously to different men; "True (says she) we pique ourselves on obliging men of merit, and do with the bra∣vest in public, what you practise with the ba∣sest in private."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are informed by Bede, that in the reign of Marcus Antonius Verus and his brother Aurelius Commodus, while Eleutherus was bishop of Rome, that
<PB N="62" REF="710"/>
Lucius king of the Britons sent an epistle to this pope, requesting his con∣version to christianity might receive the sanction of his holiness; that he soon reaped the fruit of his pious sollicitation; and that his subjects preserved the faith inviolate in peace, till the reign of Dioclesian.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Though some authors deny that ever any such prince existed, be∣cause he is not mentioned by the Greek and Latin authors who have recorded the transactions of those times, the contrary opinion is supported by some antient coins found in Cumberland and Durham, exhibiting a representation of a cross, with the letters LVC; and Monsieur Bauterue gives us the print of another, re∣presenting a man's head; and on the reverse a boar and a star, the inscription LVCIO. These circumstances indeed amount to no more than a bare proba∣bility; and that representation of the cross, on a medal struck so early as the reign of Commodus, smells strong of monkish imposition.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="33" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>We do not find that the christians in Britain were molested in the exercise of religion till the reign of Dioclesian, who being of a jealous disposition, and fearing that the progress of christianity would interfere with his authority, raised a dreadful persecution against all the professors of this doctrine: a large share of the calamity fell upon Britain, in which the celebrated St. Alban suffered martyrdom, in the manner related by Bede; and this was also the fate of a great many others, among whom Aaron and Julius are particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>This persecution raged in the beginning of the fourth century, and ceased when the government of Britain fell into the hands of Constantius Chlorus, who was favourable to the Britons, and not only encouraged them to come forth from the woods and caves in which they had lurked in the preceding reign, but als<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> permitted them to rebuild their churches, and renew the rites of the christian worship, which they enjoyed without disturbance until they were in∣fected with the Arian heresy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>That the church was established in this island, soon after the be∣ginning of the fourth century, plainly appears from the history of the council of Arles, to which three British bishops subscribed, by the names of Eborius, Restirutus, and Adelfius de civitate coloniae Londinensium. The two first were the prelates of York and London, and the last is by Usher supposed to have been bishop of Colchester, though in all probability he ruled the diocese of Lincoln, which was called Colonia Lindi; and this last word, by a mistake in the transcriber, converted into Londinensium. The decrees of this council were sent by the subscribing bishops, to the pope at Rome; but, far from addressing him as the sovereign of the church and vicar of Jesus Christ, they give him no other ep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thet in their letter than that of Dear brother: after having observed that they were all united in one bond of charity and love, they say they were at the des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of their pious emperor assembled at Arles, where they should have been glad to meet their brother the bishop of Rome; but, since they could not enjoy that comfort, they had sent an abstract of their canons, which he might publish through his whole diocese.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. As the British bishops assisted at this assembly, we cannot doubt but that they were also summoned to the succeeding council of Nice, which was convoked by Constantine, who could not be supposed to overlook his own countrymen on such an occasion; though we do not know the precise number of those who went thither, nor indeed of those who were established in Britain.
<PB N="63" REF="720"/>
We shall only observe, that all the prelates were conveyed, at the emperor's charge, to this council; which, among other decrees, established the right of ecclesiastical election and jurisdiction in the bishops, as well as the authority of provincial synods; and exempted metropolitans from the jurisdiction of the bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch. Nor, indeed, is there any one instance in those days, of a pope's consecrating British bishops, summoning them to coun∣cils, hearing their causes, receiving appeals, or exercising any legatorial autho∣rity within the British dominions.</P>

<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">

<P>The bishops of Britain were likewise present at the council of Sar∣dis, convened on account of Athanasius, who had been condemned by the east∣ern bishops. It was at this period that the Roman see began to gain ground, and some decrees of the council seem to favour its usurpation. Yet even these very degrees prove, that it had no original superiority; otherwise to what purpose were they now made? Besides, this council, called Sardica, was guilty of divers unwarrantable practices; nor was it ever deemed occumenical by the christian church.</P>
<P>As for the council of Ariminum, held in the middle of the fourth century, it was infected with Arianism; but for the honour of our country, it appears from the fragments of Hillary, that the Gallican and British bishops assembling at Pa∣ris, after the council of Ariminum, renounced the decrees of that heretical as∣sembly, and confirmed the doctrines of the Nicene faith. Let it also be re∣membered, for the glory of that pure and primitive church, that three of the British prelates, assisting at this council, were obliged to accept of the empe∣ror's allowance, because they were not able to defray the expence of their own maintenance, and too conscientious to live upon their brethren.</P>

<P>Though our bishops were extremely orthodox at this juncture, Britain was not altogether devoid of free thinkers; for, in the course of this ve∣ry century she produced the noted Pelagius, whose real name is said to have been Morgan. He was a man of acute discernment, and great subtlety in reasoning. His doctrine, which at first got footing in Gaul, was thence imported into this country, where it met with a favourable reception, and in all probability was the more readily embraced, as the author of it was a Briton, and a person of un∣blemished morals, and as it contained nothing repugnant to common sense, or the fundamental principles of the christian religion <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">He maintained that man might be righte∣ous without the assistance of grace, which was bestowed in proportion to his virtue; that man could arrive at a state of perfection, in which he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e no longer subject to passion or to sin; that there is no original sin; and that infa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dying before baptism will not be damned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the progress of this heresy alarmed the Gallican church to such a degree, that they sent over two eminent bishops to reclaim those who had im∣bibed such dangerous errors, and to confirm the rest of the nation in their ad∣herence to the true faith. These venerable missionaries were joyfully received by the clergy, and a public disputation ensued at Verolam, where the heretics<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. i. c. 17.</NOTE> were confuted, to the unspeakable satisfaction of all orthodox believers.</P>

<P>AFTER the departure of the Romans from this island, the Britons, like an helpless family de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rived of their parent and protector, resigned them∣selves to their fate with a listlessness of despondence, that denoted their degene∣racy from the valour of their ancestors. Far from practising the lessons they had received from Gallio, they aggravated their misfortunes with unavailing com∣plaints, which served only to augment and propagate their despair; and when
<PB N="65" REF="740"/>
they were driven to the necessity of making immediate efforts for their preserva∣tion, they acted with such sloth, stupidity, and distraction, as entirely defeated the purposes of their labour. The Romans had long ago deprived them of their princes, destroyed the power and independency of their clanships, abolished their old laws, customs, and religion, gradually dissolved the ties of subordi∣nation and attachment, by which their ancient dynasties subsisted; and altered the whole form of their constitution. All those who had been concerned in the adm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nistration were foreigners, by whom they were now deserted; so that they found themselves in the condition of a ship deprived of her pilot, exposed to the mercy of the next tempest that may chance to blow. All their warriors had been transported into foreign countries, where they shed their blood in the cause of strangers, while ruin poured over their own country, which their valour might have saved. In a word, they had no chief of influence and capacity suf∣ficient to unite their councils, regulate their designs, and exert that authority which alone could oblige them to take proper measures for the safety of the common-weal. They were destitute of artists, and even of materials for the fa∣bric of weapons to annoy the foe, and so accustomed to range over their forests, heaths, and mountains, that when cooped up in forts and castles they drooped and languished like captives in confinement, and seemed to lose all sense of glory, and all spirit of opposition.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>This defection was no secret to their enemies, whose views and ambi∣tion dilated accordingly. The union of the Picts and Scots, which was for∣merly the casual junction of petty clans, without order, discipline, or precon∣certed design, had now become a powerful confederacy of two warlike nations. Fergus, whom the Scotish writers call the second of that name, had arrived, from Denmark, in Braidalbin, with a great multitude of his countrymen, who were formerly expelled from Britain <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Giraldus Cambrensis says, that in the reign of Neil Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gaillac, six sons of Maud, king of Ulster<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sailed from Ireland with a large fleet to the north parts of Britain, where they settled with the Scots who followed them in the expe∣dition; and Usher is of opinion, that the eldest of those princes was Reuda, from whom this colony derived the name of Dalre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dini. They settled long before this period, in Cantire, Knapdale, and Lorn, to the north west of the frith of Clyde and castle of Dunbritton, which was the strongest fortress of the Britons inhabit∣ing Strathcluyd; and were occasionally rein∣forced from their native country, so as to be∣come six powerful clans, who probably joined the Picts, and fought as their allies, under their own independent chieftains, without being sub∣ject to any supreme sovereign, until they were all united under the monarchy of Fergus, the son of Ere. <BIBL>Top. Hibe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Dist. 3.</BIBL></NOTE>; and to him resorted an infinite concourse of people from Ireland, who transported themselves in their curroghs, or small boats to Argyle, which was the country first possessed in Britain by those adven∣turers. Far from being molested or opposed in this migration by the Picts, it had been previously concerted with those people, who foresaw in such a junction the conquest of the whole island, or at least the recovery of the province called Valentia, lying between the walls of Antoninus and Severus, which had former∣ly belonged to them and their allies. They had (as we have already observed) united their forces, and on divers occasions committed terrible depredations on the Britons; but had as often been repulsed by the valour of the Romans: and Fergus had actually lost his life in one of those engagements, leaving a minor to succeed him on the throne; so that, in all probability, nothing of moment would have happened during the minority of this prince, had not the departure
<PB N="66" REF="750"/>
of the Romans, and the well-known imbecillity of the southern Britons, en∣couraged them with the hopes of an easy conquest.</P>
<P>Elevared with these conceptions, they took the field in vast numbers, and con∣sidering the Britons as their assured prey, spread themselves all over Lothian, in which they met with no oppos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion. Having then divided the spoil and the lands, according to the previous agreement and disposition they had made, they penetrated into England, and renewed their attacks upon the wall, which was so poorly defended by the Britons, that, instead of using battering rams or other military engines for effecting a breach, they pulled down the inactive de∣fenders with iron hooks, and then undermined the fortification at their leisure. Having thus opened to themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es a passage, they ravaged the whole country with impunity, while the Britons fled before them to the woods and mountains; and as the la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds could not be cultivated in such times of danger and distress, a dreadful famine ensued, so that their condition became truly deplorable.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>In this emergency they had recourse to Aetius, the celebrated general of Valen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inian, who had with great difficulty, by the dint of vast abilities, both as a politician and an officer, prevented his master's empire from being over-run and destroyed by the Huns and other barbarians, whom he had routed in several<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 447.</NOTE> c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters.</P>
<P>This gleam of success encouraged the Britons to hope that some regard would be paid to their address, which is said to have run in this miserable strain: <Q>“To Aetius; thrice consul, the groans of the Britons.—The barbarians drive us to the sea. The sea drives us back to the barbarians; and between both, we have the wretched alternative of being murthered, or drowned!”</Q>—Such, however, were the calamities of the Romans themselves, surrounded by myri∣ads of savage nations threatening to swallow up their empire, that they could yield no assistance to the unhappy Britons; who finding themselves totally aban∣doned, began to collect courage from despair. Some of them indeed were so ab∣ject as to throw themselves upon the mercy of the enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whom they sub∣mitted; but by far the greatest part, who had retired to their mountains and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orasses, became inured to hardships, which steeled their bodies, while they sti∣mulated their revenge. Convinced of the mischiefs that flow from disunion, they endeavoured to erect an authority under which they might act with more vigour and unanimity: but, those among them who had any sort of title to this pre∣heminence, were so factious, tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bulent, and contentious, that no sooner was a general or chief elected, than he fell a sacrifice to the ambition of his rivals. Nevertheless, they made several successful sallies upon their invaders, who were a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tually repulsed by those efforts of resentment and despair; and had they known how to maintain and improve the advantages they gained, they would have had no occ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion to call in auxiliaries to their assistance. But, an extraordinary abundance, succeeding the famine by which they had so grievously suffered, they indulged themselves in riot and debauchery; so that their minds bec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me ener∣vate, and they degenerated into a total profligacy of manners, which, instead of<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de. l. i.

<P>Such a relaxation in their morals could not fail of being attended with neg∣lect, disorder, and national timidity: but, these were not the only mischievous consequences of their luxury and abundance; they were visited with a terrible pes∣tilence,
<PB N="67" REF="760"/>
by which great numbers perished; and this calamity, added to the other circumstances that concurred to enfeeble the nation, their watchful neighbours seized the opportunity of, renewing their hostilities and incursions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>In order to oppose the progress of these people, the Britons pitched upon Vortigern as their general and sovereign; a prince who is said to have raised himself to the supreme command by the murder of his predecessor Constantine, brother to the king of Armorica.</P>
<P>Whatever the arts may have been which paved the way to his elevation, he was certainly possessed of very few good qualities, and had probably recommend∣ed himself to a degenerate age by his immorality and extravagance. He was originally chieftain of the Silures settled in Radnorshire; and had acquired some reputation by his warlike atchievements against the enemies of his country: though his martial genius by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> means appeared at this juncture, when, instead of exerting the natural stre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gth of the kingdom, which, if properly applied, would have been sufficient to secure it from the designs of the enemy, he placed his dependence upon foreign auxiliaries. By his weakness or knavery, he be∣trayed his country into the hands of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xons, who had, for a century and a half, infested the coast of Britain to such a degree, that the Roman emperors, from the reign of Dioelesian, maintained a considerable military force, under the count of the Saxon shore, on purpose to secure this island against the descents of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rer.

<P N="5">V. Vortigern. exclusive of his fear, was influen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by other motives to sollicit the assistance of those rovers. He had been concerned in the murder of some Roman deputies, who were left in Britain after the departure of Gallio; and he was afraid of being deposed and punished for this outrage, should that people triumph over the barbarous nations, and reclaim the British province: besides, he dreaded the interest and pretensions of Ambrosius, a young prince descended from a Roman family, which had given sovereigns to some parts of this island, and now residing in Armorica, to which he had fled from the villainy of Vor∣tigern, by whom his father had been assassmated. These were sufficient induce∣ments<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gildas. Nennius Hist.

Having thus artfully prepared their minds for the proposal, he summoned them to a general council, on pretence of deliberating upon the necessity of the state, and there managed their passions with such dex∣terity, that they invested him with full power to invite the Saxons into England, and assign to them the isle of Thanet for their habitation.</P>

<P>The Saxons consisted of independent clans, observing the same form of government, though not subject to a monarch or single superior, except in war, when they obeyed a general of their own election: but the government was car∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed

Those brothers had formerly, in the course of their naval expeditions, landed in Britain, and been hospitably received by Vortigern, who, perhaps, took that opportunity of concerting with them the plan of their future operations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 452.</NOTE> Be that as it will, they, in consequence of the solemn invitation received from that prince, arrived with an inconsiderable number, not exceeding fifteen hundred men, and landed at Ebs-flete in the isle of Thanet, where they did not long remain inactive. Vortigern being hardly pressed by his enemies from the north, at that very juncture the Sax<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns jo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned his army, which was not a little inspirited by the arrival of such auxiliaries, and marched against the Scots and Picts, who had advanced as far as Stamford in Lincoln∣shire: a battle ensued, in which the darts and lances of the enemy were found unequal to the axes and scymitars of the Saxons and the Britons, who obtain∣ed a complete victory, and recovered all the booty which the vanquished had acquired.</P>
<P>After this action, the Saxons returned to the place appointed for their resi∣dence, and were supplied with food and raiment at the expence of Vortigern, who would have had no cause to repent of their arrival, could he have kept their number from increasing. But their own country was so populous and barren, and the fertile lands of Britain so agreeable and alluring, that, in a very little time, the brothers were reinforced by five thousand of their countrymen, who arrived in eighteen vessels, with their wives and families. These were aug∣mented by daily sresh supplies to such a formidable number, that the Britons be∣gan to see the danger of the step they had taken; and after having expostulated with their mercenaries on the breach of the contract, which restricted them to a certain number, desired them, in a very peremptory manner, to go in quest of another habitation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>At the same time they loudly exclaimed against the tyrant Vortigern, for having introduced such an insatiable crew into their country; and Hengist, who was endowed with a great share of cunning and discernment; did not fail to profit by this spirit of discontent and disaffection. He expatiated to that prince, on the danger to which he was exposed from the hatred of his subjects, the claim of Ambrosius, and the very neighbourhood of the enemy; he repre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented the necessity of maintaining his government by means of foreign auxilia∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; he insinuat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself into his confidence and esteem; and lastly, demon∣strated that the handful of Saxons under his command, could be of little service to him, in case of domestic troubles or invasion.

The infatuation of the
<PB N="69" REF="780"/>
British king is said to have been encreased by his passion for Rowena, daughter of Hengist, whose beauty captivated his heart, at a banquet to which he was in∣vited for that purpose. We are told by Nennius, that he not only married this young Saxon lady, though he had another wife alive, but even purchased her consent, by putting her countrymen in possession of the fertile plains of Kent, which lay favourable for their marine expeditions.</P>
</DIV4>

<P>The Saxons being by this time strong enough to avow their ambi∣tious designs, industriously sought occasion to quarrel with the Britons, pretend∣ing that their pay was not regularly advanced, nor their provisions furnished in sufficient quantity, according to the stipulations of their contract. They there∣fore demanded that those grievances should be immediately redressed, otherwise they would do themselves justice; and in the mean time they engaged in a treaty with the Picts, that they might be in a condition to cope with the whole power of the British nation. This alliance was effected by the means of those Saxons who had settled in<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Northumberland was settled by the Angli, who lived between Jutland and the Saxons, but universally deserted their ancient habitation, to partake with their countrymen of the fertile pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vinces of Great Britain.

What part Vortigern acted on this occasion is uncertain; but, in all probability, he remain∣ed in a state of neutrality, owing to the importunities and influence of his Saxon wife. For this reason he was grown into such contempt with his subjects, that they transferred their allegiance to his son Vortimer, the fruits of his first marri∣age, and taking up arms under the banner of this active prince, defeated the Saxons at Derwent, before they could reap any benefit from their northern alli∣ance. The next battle was fought at Aylesford in Kent, with equal obstinacy on both sides, Horsa being killed by Vortimer, whose brother Cautigern had fallen by the hands of that Saxon chief; and both armies claimed the victory, though neither had reason to boast of their success. The remaining part of the campaign produced nothing but slight skirmishes; and the season being far advanced, Hengist made a voyage to his own country, to negociate a reinforcement that might enable him to take the field in the spring, with a good prospect of advan∣tage. At the same time the Britons had recou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to their friends in Armorica, who sent over Ambrosius at the head of some troops to their assistance.</P>

<P>Vortigern was by this time become a contemptible partisan of the Saxons, and so immersed in vice and debauchery, that St. Germanus, de∣puty of the Gallican church in Britain, reprimanded him severely for his adulte∣ry and dissolute course of life, which, as he took no pains to reform, he was so∣lemnly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nenn.

<P>Immediately after the death of Horsa the sole command of the Saxons center∣ed in Hengist, who now assumed the title of king of Kent, and perhaps was complimented with the regal power by the general assembly, as the reward of his

<P>Tho' this relation seems to be copied from Witichindus, a Saxon histo∣rian, who says, such a scene was acted in Germany, not long before that period, between the Saxons and Thuringians, a massacre of the same kind might have happened in two different countries; and indeed the knowledge of the first might have suggested the same expedient to Hengist, had he thought himself in such a dangerous situation as could in any shape have excused a measure of such baseness and barbarity. But, at this conjuncture, he was under no necessity to take perfidious methods of ensuring his success: Vortimer, the most formida∣ble of all his opponents, was dead, and the sovereign rule among the Britons had returned to Vortigern, a weak irresolute prince, despised by the majority of his subjects, who were, at the same time, divided among themselves: while the Saxon king had all the reason in the world to expect considerable succours from his alliance with the North Britons. Let us therefore, rather than suppose him guilty of such an enormous treachery, conclude, that he confided in his own strength and the imbecillity of the Britons, whom he afterwards routed in the battle of Cruan-ford or Creyford, near Dartmouth, having slain four thousand of their men, and among these some of their best officers.</P>

<P>Ambrosius, being rid of all rivalship, resolved to regulate the per∣plexed affairs of his dominions: for this purpose, he convoked a general assembly of the princes and nobles at York, where measures were concerted for re-establish∣ing the churches and restoring the tranquillity of Britain. Then he marched with an army to London, which in all likelihood still remained in the hands of the Saxons, whom he expelled, and from thence made a progress to Win∣chester and Salisbury, where he restored the British interest and dominion: it was on this expedition that he was solemnly crowned at Stonehenge; and this part of the country was the place of his residence and burial, as appears from the word Ambresbury, which is the name of a village in the neighbourhood of Salisbury plain.</P>
<P>The tranquillity which Britain now enjoyed was owing rather to the weakness than the pacific disposition of its enemies; for, no sooner did Hengist and his son Esca find themselves in a condition to recommence hostilities, either in con∣sequence of having received a reinforcement from Saxony, or of civil dissen∣sions among the Britons, than they took the field again, and laying waste the country, compelled the inhabitants to fly before their arms: perhaps they were

<P>This excellent prince, who was a sound politician as well as a consum∣mate warrior, foreseeing a very troublesome opposition, should the Saxons settled in Northumberland extend their possessions so as to be able to unite oc∣casionally with their brethren of Kent, contrived a very effectual expedient to keep those northern invaders employed at home, by projecting a plan of alliance with the Scots, independant of the Picts, who were the stanch friends and con∣sederates of the Saxons. Those two nations had already begun to be infected with mutual jealousy and distrust, and many disputes had happened between them about the division of the lands and plunder which they had ravished from the Britons; so that their friendship was in the wane, when Ambrosius made his proposals to the Scots, who found them too advantageous to be rejected. He ceded to them the lands between the friths; and they engaged to harrass the northern Saxons with incessant irruptions. They performed their part of the contract with incredible alacrity and perseverance, because they found their account in pillaging a rich industrious people by surprize; and this alliance with Ambrosius, but especially the cession of the Regnum Cumbrense, was productive of a long<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> war between the Scots and Picts, which ended in the extirpation of the latter, and even in the extinction of the name; while the Britons underwent the same fate from their Saxon conquerors <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">At this period Merlin, the famous British prophet and inchanter, rendered himself famous in Britain.

Thus he laid the foundation of the kingdom of the South Saxons, which afterwards included the forest, together with the greatest part of Surrey: but, this monarchy was not established without great difficulty and bloodshed; for, the Britons would not part with their possessions till after an obstinate opposition, in the course of which they sought several battles with various success, particularly that of Maer-credes-burn, where they were commanded by Ambrosius, who, though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

After the death of Hengist, Aella being reinforced by a body of his countrymen from Germany, undertook the siege of Andred-ceaster, which proved a very tedious and hazardous enterprize. The Britons exerted all their courage and activity for the preservation of this important place, and harrassed the besiegers to such a degree, by throwing missiles at a distance, attacking them by surprise, and retreating suddenly to their woods, through which they could not be pursued, that the Saxon general found it impracticable to reduce the town, un∣til he had divided his army into two bodies, one of which was employed to co∣ver the besiegers: then he carried on his attacks with redoubled fury, and was

so much exasperated at the obstinate defence made by the besieged, that when at last he took the place by assault, he ordered the garrison and inhabitants to be put to the sword, and burned the town to ashes. Having thus extended his conquests to the frontiers of Kent, which was now peaceably occupied by Esca, the son of Hengist, he assumed the title of King, after having resided fourteen years in the island, and reigned with great reputation<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><P>He died after a reign of thirty-two years, leaving his dominions to his son Cissa, who ex∣tended the limits of his sovereignty, and reduced an old Roman station, the Regnum in the Iti∣nerary of Anto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which being rebuilt and fortified, derived from this prince the name of Chichester.

<P>From this period there is an interval of five years, during which we find no transaction of historical authenticity; but, this was succeeded by a very remarkable event, namely the arrival of a Saxon chief called Cerdic and his son Cynric, who, with a body of troops, embarked in five ships, arrived at a place since known by the name of Cerdicshore, which Camden supposes to be Cerdic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, near Yarmouth in Yorkshire; but Matthew of Westminster more judiciously places it on the western coast, in the neighbourhood of Dorset and Hants, which with some of the adjoining counties formed the scene of his con∣quests. He was opposed on the very first day of his landing by the Britons, who attacked him with their usual impetuosity, but were repulsed towards night; and as they did not appear next day, he extended his quarters along the shore. They did not, however, lay aside their design of distressing this invader, but harrassed him in an unintermitting war of five and twenty years, in the course of which he must have abandoned the footing he had gained, unless he had been powerfully assisted by his countrymen already settled in Britain, and sup∣plied with strong reinforcements from Germany. One of these was conducted by Porte, with his sons Bieda and Megla, who made their first descent at Port∣land or Portesham, near Abbotsbury in Dorsetshire, and sustained a vigorous at∣tack from the natives, commanded by a young nobleman, who lost his life in the engagement.</P>

<P>Mean while Cerdic made such progress in his conquests, that he seems<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

But, whosoever he might be, certain it is, he assembled the whole

strength of the kingdom, while Cerdic, in order to oppose such united force, de∣manded and received succours from Esca king of Kent, Aella king of Sussex, Porte, who had settled in Hampshire, and all the Saxon colonies in Britain. Thus reinforced, he formed his army into two divisions, one of which he led in person, giving the command of the other to his son Cynric, and advanced against the Britons, in order to terminate the war by one decisive battle. The British monarch, far from declining the trial, attacked his division in person with such irresistible impetuosity, that the Saxons were broke and routed with great slaughter; when Cynric perceiving the Britons pursuing without order, and fatigued with the action, charged them in flank with such vigour that they were obliged to face about in their own defence.

<P>It was at this period that the celebrated Arthur appeared with such dignity upon the stage, and revived the drooping spirits of his countrymen. This prince, of whom such miraculous exploits are recorded, is of such obscure original, that some authors suppose him to be the son of this Nathan Leod; others alledge his father was Uther Pendragon, brother of Ambrosius: but he is generally thought to be of Cornish extraction, and son of Gurlois king of that province: this is the opinion of the Welsh authors, who say he was born at Tin∣dangel, and sovereign of that county alone, while other historians affirm, that his dominion extended over all the Britons. Both these allegations may be true, if we suppose his hereditary power was confined to Cornwal, and that he was elected to the supreme command, like his predecessors, who reigned over all the Britons without exception. If we embrace this conjecture, we cannot help giving credit to Malmesbury, who affirms that he had served as general under Ambrosius; and surely, the Britons could not pitch upon a more proper person for the sovereign sway, than a prince of Arthur's heroic genius, who had been trained to war in their armies, and in all probability was at hand to collect their scattered forces, and take immediate measures for repairing the damage they had sustained. In this station, he exerted himself with such bravery and conduct, that, according to Nennius and the most authentic historians, he worst∣ed the Saxons in twelve successive battles; though these seem to have been in∣considerable skirmishes, in which the British prince acquired more glory than ad∣vantage; for the scene of the war was con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned to Lincolnshire and part of Wales; and the Saxons, notwithstanding all those checks, prosecuted the war with such vigour and perseverance, that Arthur was sain at last to conclude a treaty, by which he yielded to Cerdic the counties of Hants and Somerset, which<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> were afterwards erected into the kingdom of Wessex <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The detail of this hero's supposed atchieve∣ments<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>offry of Monmouth, is an extra∣vag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt ill con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved romance, more worthy of the invention of a Welsh bard, like Taliessin, than of the pen of an authentic historian.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The Britons being now driven to despair, collected their whole force in order to revenge, at one blow, all the calamities they had suffered from this Saxon prince and his father; and advancing as far as Banbury castle near Marlborough, divided their army into nine bodies, of which they formed three regular lines, having the horse and archers upon the wings, in the manner of the Romans. In this order they were attacked by Kenric and his son Ceaulin, at the head of their Saxons armed with swords and maces, who, notwithstanding all their boasted valour, and the advantage they had in point of weapons over the arrows

<P>After this encounter, Ceaulin's forces, under the command of his brother Cutha or Cuthol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, advancing as far as Bedford, fought the battle which decided the fate of Mercia; for the Britons being defeated, had no alternative but that of submitting quietly or abandoning their country.

<P>This defeat, and the arrival of Cerdic, who formed the Mercian kingdom about this period, obliged the Britons to retire beyond the Severne, in order to wait for another opportunity to attack the Saxona with some prospect of success; and such an occasion very soon occurred. The ferocious disposition of Ceaulin rendered him as odious to his own subjects, as he was detested by Ethelbert, king of Kent, who had not laid aside the hope of retrieving the former importance of his family. He therefore fomented the dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontent of Ceau∣lin's subjects, until it broke out in an open rebellion, headed by his own nephew Ceolric, son of the brave Cuthulf, lately deceased, and even engaged the Bri∣tons and Scots in his consederacy, by flattering them with the hope of revenging themselves upon the tyrant. They joined forces therefore, and advancing to Wod∣nesburg, or Wantborough in Wilts, gave battle to Ceaulin, who being def<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated, fled from his dominions and died in exile, while his kingdom devolved to Ceola, and Ethelbert was declared chief of the Saxon confederacy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>This prince, who had very early in li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e displayed his ambition, was by this time distinguished for his great capacity, and soon rendered himself for∣midable by his power to the other Saxon potentates. He married Bertha, daughter of Cherebert, king of Paris; an alliance, which while it gratified his pride, added lustre and importance to his character at home; so that he was en∣abled to exercise a kind of tyrannical dominion over the Saxons, who were set∣tled to the southward of the Humber. On the death of Crida, king of Mercia, he seized that kingdom as lord paramont, though Widda, the son of the late king, still survived; but finding this act of violence had produced murmurs and dis∣contents among the other Saxon princes, he thought proper to restore it, after it had continued three years in his possession, though he still rese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved a sort of su∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riority over Widda's administration.</P>

<P><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This and the following transactions are ex∣tracted from an old manuscript history of the church of Landa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which contains also a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious detail of the ceremony of the oath and the abso∣lution.</NOTE> Among all the instances of ecclesiastic authority exercised over the British princes in those days, we find no example of a king's being dethron∣ed, and his place supplied with another, by the apostolical power of the clergy; on the contrary, the following incident plainly proves that they did not conceive themselves to be vested with any such prerogative. Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant, and Frioc his uncle, two petty princes of Wales, had, according to the fashion of the times, solemnly sworn in presence of St. Oudoceus and his clergy, that if ever the one should murther or betray the other, the offender should not have it in his power to commute his crime for gold or silver, but resign the government of his king∣dom, and end his days in pilgrimage. This oath was soon violated by Mor∣cant, who murdered his uncle; and then desired he might buy off the penalty from the church of Landaff. The case was debated in full synod at Landaff; and he was absolved on promise of fasting, praying, and giving alms; that the government might not suffer by his absence, as they had no power to create a new king. This decree not only implies the limited power of the clergy, but is a sure mark of the independency of the British church, which thus proceeded to exert the last stroke of sacerdotal authority without the sanction of Rome, or any pretended superiority of ecclesiastic jurisdiction, to which no delinquent ever dreamed of appealing from the censure of our own prelates.</P>

<P>The princes of those days must have been extremely barbarous and brutal: for we find there was another synod held at the same place, by the
<PB N="82" REF="910"/>
same prelate, upon a similar subject. A certain prince, called Guidnorth, flew his own brother; and, being excommunicated by the clergy, suffered under the sen∣tence three whole years, at the expiration of which he had recourse to Oudoceus, who sent him in pilgrimage to Samson, archbishop of Dole, in Bretagne, where he thought the prince might comfortably accomplish his penance, as an intima∣cy sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted between Samson and Theleaus of Landaff; and as Guidnorth would be perfectly at his ease among people who spoke his own language, and owned themselves of British extraction. This royal penitent, however, thought the term prescribed for his pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance was too tedious, and returned to Britain before it was expired, in hope of prevailing upon Oudoceus to allow of commutation; and although that good prelate died before he could obtain his consent, he pur∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased absolution of his successor Berthguin for a valuable consideration. Be∣sides these co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncils held by Oudoceus, St. David assembled a synod at a place called Vittory, in which the acts of the council of Brevy were confirmed, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Girald.

<P>The christian religion, if we may believe Gildas, never suffered more persecution than it underwent in Britain, from the barbarity of the Saxon pagans, who burned all the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies and churches to the ground from sea to sea, and stained the altars with the blood of the clergy, after having massacred all those whom they found in the exercise of the christian religion. We must, however, read with caution the writings of a British author, who seems to have been rancorou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y prejudiced against the enemies of his country. It has been a constant remark in all ages, that no quarrel rages to such a pitch of cruelty and outrage, as that which is inflamed with an ingredient of religion. The Saxons were considered, not barely as enemies and invaders of the Britons, but as impious pagans and idolaters, who came to destroy the faith, and seize the lands of the clergy. These were such aggravations of hostile intent, that even when the Britons found themselves altogether unable to cope with the intruders, the priests would not allow them to submit; but wound them up to an enthusiastic fury, which prompted them to rush upon the swords of their enemies; and all that perished by their own madness, were accounted martyrs to their religion.</P>

<P>We do not find that those who submitted and lived among the conquerors, were molested on the score of religion: on the contrary, it appears from St. Gregory's letter to Theoderet and Theobald, kings of the Franks, that the Saxons, inf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uenced (without doubt) by the example of those peaceable Britons, discovered a desire to become christians; but that the church of the Britons, from motives of hatred and aversion, refused to encourage them in those lauda∣ble sentiments, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to instruct them in the principles and doctrines of the true faith: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, it was this pious disposition which induced that pope to send over Augustin to complete the work of their conversion. Before his elevation to the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icate, he chanced one day to pass through the slave market, where observ∣ing some young men, of engaging aspects, standing ready to be sold to the best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idder, he inquired about their country, and finding they were English pagans, was seized with an emotion of pity, which did not arise from the circumstances <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their slavery, but from the thraldom of their souls, which were under the do∣minion of the devil. The good man was so much melted by this consideration, that he resolved to deliver the whole nation from the tyranny of Satan, and with that view he actually embarked in a ship for Britain, when his pious inten∣tion
<PB N="83" REF="920"/>
was frustrated by his popularity in Rome; for his des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn was no sooner made public, than the citizens presented a re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstrance to pope Benedict, re∣questing that Gregory might not be suffered to absent himself from his evange∣lical functions in that city; and he was recalled accordingly.</P>

<P>He did not however lay aside his apostolical design; for, when he succe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Pelagius in the papal chair, he ordered a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k called Augustin, and others of the same brotherhood, to undertake the office of missionaries in Britain. They obeyed his hol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness, though they had no great stomach to the enterprize; but their terrors wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d so strong, before they had performed one half of the journey, that they sent back A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gustin with a petition to the pope, begging they might be excused from a mission that must necessarily expose their lives to the most imminent danger from the prejudice and barbarity of such a ferocious nation.

<P>At the same time, he recommended them strongly to Aethercus, arch∣bishop of Arles, desiring that he would assist them with all manner of accom∣modations in their journey; and he sent letters of the same purport to the King and Queen of the Franks, by whom they were supplied with interpreters, who greatly facilitated the success of the mission <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>Britain, even in this age, produced a num∣ber of men eminent for piety and learni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g; the most remarkable of whom were Dubri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius, St. David, the two Samsons, both archbishops of York, and both translated from thence to the archbishopric of Dole in Britanny; the second i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to have been of royal birth, and to have carried abroad with him many records relating to his see, which never could be recovered.

<P>IN order to make the reader acquainted with the genius of the Saxons, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettled in England, and whose history begins as it were at this period, it will be necessary to give a succinct acount of their civil and rellgious government, as well as of the particular customs by which their character is distinguished and ascertained.</P>
<P>Their government was aristocratical; for, though the people were consulted in all affairs of very great consequence, or fundamental points of constitution, and their sentiments expressed in a very tumultuary manner, the authority re∣sided in a few noblemen, who were no other than chieftains of distinct tribes, united for their mutual advantage. Of these a certain number was chosen, to su∣perintend the administration of justice, and in time of war one of that number was elected general or king, but his power expired at the return of peace. We are not to look for a settled constitution among the Saxons, who first landed in Britain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> They were bold, illiterate adventurers, who enli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted as volunteers with comman∣ders of approved valour, under whose conduct they hoped to gain an agreeable settlement, or reap a plentiful harvest of plunder. Though they retained the manners and customs of their own country, it is not to be supposed they would adhere to the established forms of government in a military expedition, during which they were obliged to contrive new regulations according to the emergency of their affairs, the character of their leaders, and the inconstancy or caprice of their own disposition. When they acquired settlements in Britain, they formed new societies, and would have naturally adopted the constitution of their own country, had not divers circumstances concurred to shew them the expediency of altering the system of government. Their leaders had gained an accession of power, in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse of their military command; and the soldiers, inured to rapine and irregu∣larities, could not be restrained within proper bounds, by any civil institution weaker than that of regal authority. Nor without such a power to unite, con∣troul, and command the petty chiefs as well as the commons, could the necessary measures have been taken for the preservation of their colonies in a strange country, surrounded by implacable foes, who exerted their utmost vigilance, courage, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ivity for their destruction. These confiderations, reinforced by the mot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves of private interest and ambition, induced the communities of the Saxon adventurers in England, to invest particular persons with the kingly pre∣rogative, under such restrictions, however, as formed a mutual compact, ren∣dering the ties of allegiance and protection equally binding and reciprocal.</P>

<P>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore this establishment of sovereign authority, the Saxons assembled upon certain days to deliberate upon public affairs; and they generally met in arms. The assembly being convened, silence was commanded by a priest, who seems to have had great authority on such occasions: then, some person eminent for military virtue, quality or eloquence, stood up and harangued the multitude on the subject of their meeting; and his speech was either condemned by a tumultuous noise, or applauded by the clattering of their javelins. The
<PB N="87" REF="960"/>
common business of these councils was to appoint chiefs for presiding in their several divisions, shires, streets, and villages; and each of these presidents was assisted by an hundred commoners by way of assessors <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hence we derive our hundred courts in England; in which the centenarius or hundre∣darius anciently presided as judge, and all the best men of the county were his a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ors and jurors.

<P>Though those consultations were held by the chiefs and people in com∣mon, every individual was not admitted to the council, which consisted of such only as wore armour, and no man was entitled to this privilege until he had, by the consent and determination of the council, been formally armed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relation or godfather with a shield and lan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; so that this ceremony seems to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. de Mor.

<P>The children succeeded to the inheritance of their fathers, without will: but after their settlement in Britain, they found it convenient to alter this institution; as all the property accruing from conquest was personal acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion, and there∣fore alienable.

They seem to have paid their devotions to Venus under the denomina∣tion of Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, who presided over the sixth day; and Tuesday derived its name from Tuysco, whom they cultivated as the founder of their nation. They likewise worshipped a goddess, whom they termed Eoster, and to her they dedi∣cated the month of April, during which the wind commonly blows from the East, consequently favourable to them when they set out on their marine ex∣peditions. But their principal patroness was Hartha or Earth, whose residence was in a vehicle covered with a sacred vestment, and placed in a consecrated grove, in a certain island of the ocean. This ark was sometimes carried about by cows, and attended by a priest, who alone was permitted to touch the vehi∣cle.

They were so infatuated in their attachment to games of chance, that a man, after having lost all his effects, very often played away his liberty, and allowed himself to be sold for a slave.

<P>§ VIII. We have already seen that Augustin and some fellow-labourers were dismissed by Gregory bishop of Rome, in order to convert those ignorant and boisterous Saxons, who had been so much occupied in tumults of war and necessary regulations touching their civil government, that hitherto they had found no time nor opportunity to consider the difference of religions, much less to be influenced, dazzled, and convinced by the truth and purity of the Christian doctrine; for, the number of individuals, who had already embraced the faith, was but inconsiderable when compared to the bulk of the nation. As this was certainly the case, Augustin would in all probabi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity have found his mission very troublesome and hazardous, if he had not met with a powerful patroness in Bertha, consort of Ethelbert king of Kent, who had already made an impression on the mind of her h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sband, by her virtuous conduct, benevolence, and discretion, manifested in a course of thirty years which they lived together. By the articles of her marriage, she enjoyed the free exercise of her religion, and was attended by a venerable prelate called Luidhard, who officiated in a church dedicated to St. Martin, which had been built by the Romans near the walls of Canterbury. The exemplary conduct and powerful preaching of this pri∣mitive bishop, co-operated with the queen's learning and zeal, in giving a fa∣vourable idea of the Christian religion to Ethelbert himself, as well as his courtiers, who by this time had even discovered a desire of being converted; so that the vineyard was well prepared when Augustin landed in the isle of Thanet<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Upon his first landing he sent one of his interpreters to the Kentish king, declaring he was come from Rome with offers of eternal salvation; and in the mean time he and his followers lay in the open air, that they might not, by entering a Saxon house, subject themselves to the power of heathen necro∣mancy. The king immediately ordered them to be furnished with all necessaries, and even visited them in the isle of Thanet, though he did not declare himself a convert until after they had fixed their residence in Canterbury, where, by their sermons in St. Martin's chapel, the austerity and innocence of their man∣ners, and certain miracles, which had an effect upon the vulgar, they had gained a great number of proselytes, and prepossessed the whole kingdom in their fa∣vour. Then the king openly espoused the Christian religion; and Augustin, who had received episcopal ordination from the primate of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, erected Christ-church into a cathedral. The heathen temples being purified and hallowed, were converted into places of worship, and the churches which had decayed were repaired; a seminary for learning was opened, the abbey of St. Augustin founded; and this apostle being now in possession of the see of Canterbury, endeavoured to extend his authority, and constitute himself me∣tropolitan over a number of suffragans. With this view he had recourse to

Nevertheless, his nephew Ceolric, by whom he was vanquished and dispossessed, still retained Sussex as part of his conquest. Not that the South Saxons submitted quietly to the yoke; on the contrary, they made divers attempts to recover their indepen∣dence. They revolted against Ceolwulph, king of Wessex, who reduced them to obedience. Their next effort met with better success: for, during the exile of Cenowalch, king of Wessex, which had fallen under the dominion of the Mer∣cian king Penda, they seized this opportunity of investing one Adelwalch with the regal authority. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The kingdom of Wessex was so weakened by the invasion of Penda, who possessed it three whole years, that Cenowalch, after his restoration, could not undertake the enterprize of dethroning the new king of Sussex; for he himself was attacked by Wolphur, king of Mercia, who worsted him in divers encounters, and afterwards penetrating into Sussex, defeated Adelwalch, whom he took prisoner in the battle; and made himself master of that kingdom and the isle of Wight. The captivity of the vanquished king turned to his ad∣vantage, inasmuch as he was converted by his conqueror, who not only set him at liberty, but made him a present of the isle of Wight, which he had subdued. This seems to have been given as an addition to his own kingdom, in which he re-assumed the sway after Wolphur's death, and ruled peaceably until his domi∣nions were again invaded by Ceadwalla, a prince of the West Saxons, against whom he took the field, and a battle ensued, in which he was defeated, and slain. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Yet even after the death of Adelwalch, the conqueror met with a strong op∣position from Authun and Berthun, two of his generals, who had just returned from an expedition into Kent; and before he could make himself master of the throne of Sussex, the king of Wessex dying he returned to that kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. l. iii Ann.

<P>The other transactions that distinguished the reign of those two Saxon prin∣ces, shall be related in the history of those kingdoms which they conce n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; we shall only observe that Cinegil's conversion was effected by the sermon and exhortations of an Italian monk called Berinus, reinforced by the political con∣siderations of an advantageous alliance with Oswald king of Northumberland, who pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed the Christian religion, and married Kiniburg daughter of the Wessexian prince. His brother or son Quinchelm did not immediately follow his example, but being afterwards seized with a dangerous distemper, embraced the true faith, and died immediately after his baptism. Cinegils survived him about seven years, and then resigned his breath, after a glorious reign, in which he and his colleague had acquired the reputation of great and virtuous princes. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>His successor was his own son Cenwal, a weak prince, who inhe∣rited nothing of the father but his crown. He married the sister of Penda king of Mercia, whom he repudiated without any cause assigned, and then re∣nounced the Christian religion. Penda, incensed at the outrage offered to his sister, invaded the dominions of this licentious prince, whom he routed, and obliged to fly for refuge to the East Anglian court, where he was, during a residence of three years, reformed by the pious admonition of An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as the East Anglian monarch, and afterwards re-established on the throne which Penda had possessed in his absence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">In all probability Penda set up his cousin Cuthred, the son of Quinche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, as the rightful heir of the crown; and this pretender was so powerfully supported, that Cenwal was fain to come to a composition, and purchased a renun∣ciation of Cathred's claim, with three thousand hides of land, which were granted to that prince, near Ashton, in Northamptonshi e.

<P>The Britons encouraged by the intestine commotions of Cen∣wal's kingdom, and the damage he had sustained from the arms of Penda, assembled an army and entered his dominions: Cenwal, advancing with his forces to oppose them, was attacked at a hill called Pene in Somersetshire, with such fury that his Saxons began to give ground; but disdaining the thoughts of being worsted by an enemy, whom they had so often defeated, they re∣collected all their courage and resolution, and returning to the charge with re∣doubled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.

Though the Britons were thus effectually quelled, he found himself still embroiled with the Mercians, whose king Wulphur seems to have inherited his predecessor's enmity to Cenwal, over whom he seems to have gained the advantage in the battle of Pontesbury in Shropshire; for, he ravaged the country as far as Ashton, and in the course of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At her decease the nobles divided the kingdom among them∣selves, though it appears that this aristocracy was not of long duration; for, in the course of the year that succeeded Saxburga's death, we find the kingdom possessed by Es<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, descended from the famous Cerdic.

<P>He was succeeded by Centwin son of the late king Cinegils, who obtained several victories over the Britons, whom he repelled even to the western shore; and his success obliged their king Cadwallader to go in person, and demand suc∣cours of the king of Armorica; that prince afterwards made a journey to Rome, where he died.</P>

<P>Towards the latter end of Centwin's reign, he conceived a jealousy of his kinsman Ceadwalla, a prince of great hopes, who had won the affec∣tions of the people, and acquired a popularity which Centwin thought dange∣rous to his throne. He therefore ordered him to quit the kingdom; and he retired into Sussex with a numerous train of attendants in arms, so as to give umbrage to Adelwalch sovereign of that country, who assembled a body of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 686</NOTE> troops to expel that adventurer, and (as we have already observed) lost his life in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e attempt.

<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever happiness the conduct of his youth might have promised to his subjects, certain it is he was savage and cruel almost beyond example. After having terminated the war against Authun and Berthun, to his own ad∣vantage, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e invaded and ravaged the country of Kent; and afterwards attacked the isle of Wight, which had depended upon the kingdom of Sussex, ever since Wulphur had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stowed it upon Adelwalch. Arwalt brother of Authun was at that time governor of the island, which he attempted to defend, but being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retire and leave the inhabitants at the mercy of the victor, who behaved upon this occasion with such brutal barbarity as must render his name infamous to all posterity. Being apprehensive that the people of the isle of Wight would take the first opportunity of withdrawing their necks from his yoke, he resolved to exterminate them on pretence of their being idolators; and actually executed this cruel massacre upon all the inhabi∣tants, except two hundred famil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which with their lands and effects he pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nted to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prime minister Wilfred, bishop of Selsey, who accepted of the donation with a view to convert those poor souls to Christianity. Two sons of Arwalt made shift to escape to Stoneham, in Hampshire, where they for some time concealed themselves from the cruelty of this tyrant; but at last they were
<PB N="97" REF="1060"/>
discovered and put to death, after the abbot of Reodford, now Redbridge, had been permitted to make them proselytes to the christian religion, of which Ceadwalla's conduct must have certainly given them a very sublime and favour∣able idea. For, tho' he had not yet formally abjured paganism, he affected great devotion and zeal for the church, and even bestowed upon it a tythe of all the spoils and plunder he had made: a very effectual atonement, in consideration of which the clergy gave him absolution for all the villanies he could perpetrate.</P>

<P>Kent likewise felt the inhumanity of his disposition, when he took vengeance on that country for the death of his brother Mollo. At length he set out for Rome, to receive baptism from the hands of the pope, who could not refuse that favour to such a munificent benefactor of the church. He was ac∣cordingly christened by Sergius II. who bestowed upon him the name of Peter; and dying soon after his baptism, was buried in St. Peter's church, where his tomb is distinguished by an inscription, signifying his name, age, quality, and time of his decease.</P>

One of the first steps he took after his elevation to the supreme authority, was to compile a body of laws, which served as the groundwork of those afterwards published by Alfred: he likewise convoked a ge∣neral council of the clergy; in which it was determined that all the churches, monasteries, and places of religious worship, which had gone to ruin or decay, should be forthwith rebuilt and repaired; and indeed the monkish histori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> have been so engrossed with his pious benefactions, that they have given a very confused detail of the other incidents in his reign.

<P>But that which dignified his character, in the eyes of the clergy, above all his military exploits, was his munificence to the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch, and the ab∣dication of his kingdom, to which he was per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uaded, partly by his own con∣science, and partly by the pious suggestions of his wife Ethelburga.

For the maintenance of this college and the adjoining church, he assigned as a fund the famous tax of Peter Pence, which, though at first an elemosynary donation, was in the sequel claimed by the popes as a legal revenue. He re-visited his own country, in order to establish this imposition, and take leave of his wife Ethelburga, who retired into the monastery of Berking: then returning to Rome, he assumed the habit of a monk, and died in con∣tempt and obscurity.</P>

<P>Having thus revenged the murder of their king, and performed his funeral obsequies at Winchester, they filled the vacant throne with his son Brithric, who was a prince of a pacific disposition, and picqued himself more upon making his people happy under a well regulated administration, than in acquiring a less solid reputation for military exploits. Notwithstanding this meekness and moderation, he could not help conceiving an ungenerous jealousy from the great qualities of Egbert, a prince of the blood, whose amiable character had won the affections of the people. He no sooner discovered the dangerous predica∣ment in which he stood, than he retired to the court of Offa the Mercian king, where meeting with a cold reception, on account of a match which was at that juncture concluded between Brithric and Offa's daughter Edburga, he made a voyage to France, where Charlemagne received him with great hospitality, and on different occasions, honoured him with singular marks of esteem.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Northumberland was divided on the south from Mercia, by the river Humber; the Irish sea bounded it on the west; it was washed on the east, by the German ocean; and extended to the north a considerable way into Lothian. It comprehended the provinces now called Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland, Yorkshire, and the bishopric of Durham; and its chief towns were York, Durham or Dunelm, Carlile, called by the Romans Luguballia, Hexham or Hagulstadt, and Lan∣caster.
<PB N="102" REF="1110"/>
This extent of country, amounting to one hundred and sixty miles in length, and about one hundred at its broadest part, was formerly divided into two provinces, called Deira and Bernicia, and these were at one time two inde∣pendent kingdoms, the first consisting of the southern parts, and the other beginning at the north side of the wall built by Severus. But this division did not take place t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the death of Ida, who founded the monarchy, and be∣queathed Bernicia to his son Adda, while his other son Alla succeeded to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>We know nothing of the first four kings that succeeded Adda, except their names, whic hwere Clappa, Theodulph, Freothulph, Theodric, and Edelric, who mounted the throne in his old age, and associated his son Ethelfrid as his coad∣jutor<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This prince having married Acca daughter of Alla king of Deira, seized upon that kingdom at the death of his father-in-law, though he had left an infant son called Edwin.</P>

<P>Ethelfrid, after his father's decease, became very powerful and ter∣rible to his enemies the Scots, who made frequent incursions into his territories, not only for the sake of plunder, but also in compliance with the sollicitations of the Britons, with whom the Scottish king Aidan had engaged in an offensive and defensive alliance. It was probably at their instigation that this monarch, even in his old age, invaded the territories of Ethelfrid, who engaging him at Degrasten, when his men were loaded with plunder, an obstinate battle ensued, in which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chan. l. v.</NOTE> though Aidan was defeated, the Northumbrian king's brother Theobald, and a great number of Saxons, were slain. Whether Ethelfrid resented the beha∣viour of the Britons, who had persuaded Aidan to invade his dominions, or was instigated by the remonstrances of Augustin, whose jurisdiction had been re∣jected by the British bishops, he advanced at the head of his victorious troops to besiege Chester, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was occupied by the Britons, who resolved to stand battle; and in the mean time brought out above twelve hundred monks<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>While Ethelfrid thus aggrandized himself at the expence of his ene∣mies, Edwin his brother-in-law wandered from place to place, in quest of assist∣ance that might enable him to retrieve his inheritance; and though he could find no prince that would run the risque of incurring the resentment of the usurper in his behalf, he was hospitably received by Redwald king of East Anglia, who sympathized with his distress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and conceived an affection for his character. But, he had not long enjoyed the happiness of this retreat, when Ethelfrid sent an embassy with the offer of an alternative to Redwald, importing that he should either deliver up the refugee, in consideration of a certain sum of money to be pa d for his head, or bear the brunt of a bloody war, in quality of Edwin's protector.</P>

<P>Redwald, allured by the bribe, and intimidated by the menaces of such a formidable monarch, for some time wavered between his glory and convenience; but was at length determined by the suggestions of his conscience, reinforced with the mediation of his queen, in favour of the young prince, to whom he

In these sentiments he assembled his forces without de∣lay, in hopes of falling upon Ethelfrid before he should be prepared for his reception; and dividing his army into three separate bodies, gave the command of the first to his son Reyner, with order to advance and take possession of a certain pass, while he himself followed at a small distance, and the last division was brought up by Edwin. But Reyner giving way to the impetuosity of his cou∣rage, left his father too far behind to be properly sustained; and Ethelfrid, who had already taken the field, encountering him near the river Idel, in Nottingham∣shire, he lost his life, and his troops were routed with great slaughter. Redwald enraged, but not dispirited by the loss of his son, advanced with the remaining part of his army, and attacked the Northumbrians, fatigued with action and disordered in the pursuit; and here the battle was renewed with equal ferocity on both sides, till the troops of Ethelfrid being overpowered by the number of the East-Anglians, headed by Redwald raging like a lioness robbed of her young and animated by the example of the gallant Edwin, could no longer withstand the shock, but fled with great precipitation. Ethelfrid seeing his men give way, notwithstanding all his efforts to rally their broken battalions, and scorning to outlive the disgrace of an overthrow, rushed furiously into the midst of the ene∣my, where he fell covered with wounds, after having performed miracles of per∣sonal valour.</P>

<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The victorious Redwald marched directly into Northumberland, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 617. Hen. Hunt.</NOTE> he met with no opposition; for Ethelfrid's three sons Anfrid, Oswald, and Oswy, had fled for refuge into Scotland: he, therefore received the submission of the Northumbrians, without exception. Far from using the rights of a conqueror to their prejudice, he generously established Edwin in the possession of both kingdoms, though his claim had been limited to Deira alone, and con∣tented himself with the glory of such a generous expedition.</P>
<P>Edwin being thus unexpectedly raised, from the condition of an hopeless fugi∣tive to the possession of two powerful kingdoms, employed the first years of his reign in civilizing his subjects, who were savaged by the continual wars and ravages which had so long prevailed between them and their neighbours of North Britain. He not only enacted wise laws and regulations for punishing rapine, and restraining the ferocity of the common people, but ordered these institutions to be executed with such punctuality, that in a little time, peace and order reigned throughout the whole kingdom <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">We are told by Bede, that he ordered wells to be m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de and supplied with brass cups or lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, in the most dry and desart parts of his kingdom, for the accommodation of thirsty tra∣vellers; and that a woman with an infant in her arms might have walked over the whole king∣dom without fear of violence.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii.</NOTE></P>

<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>After the death of Redwald, who had been raised to the supreme power over all the kings of the heptarchy, Edwin, who always respec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> him as a benefactor, openly declared his design of possessing that dignity; and no prince disputed his pretensions but Quinchelm, king of Wessex, who by this opposition brought upon himself a war which endangered his dominions, and
<PB N="104" REF="1130"/>
compelled him at last to sue for peace. This contention being terminated by the treaty, he was vested with the sovereign command; and the Britons, whom he threatened to invade, consented to pay a tribute, rather than incur the effects of his indignation.</P>
<P>Thus aggrandized by a chain of successful events, part of which he owed to fortune, and part to his own superior talents, he began to extend the authority with which he had been lately invested, and pretended to ex∣ert an absolute dominion over all the other kings of the heptarchy. He had formerly been married to a sister of the Mercian king; but she dying, he now resolved to espouse Ethelburga, sister to Eadbald king of Kent, a princess of great merit, who would have doubtless rejected any match, howsoever advantageous, with a pagan, had not she been animated with the zeal of converting him and his subjects to the christian religion. Before she would give her con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, how∣ever, it was solemnly stipulated that she should have the free exercise of her own worship, and be attended by bishop Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus, who propagated the gospel among the Northumbrian infidels, and was instrumental in the conversion of Edwin himself. After he had defeated Quinchelm, and ravaged the country of Wessex with great severity, he returned to his own kingdom, and began to discover signs of uneasiness touching the religion he professed: the queen, assisted by Paulinus, had not failed to prepossess his mind in favour of christianity; but, he still re∣tained scruples which they had not been able to remove, and this uncertainty produced disquiet and perturbation. While he thus hesitated between the true faith and idolatry, his determination was influenced by the conduct of his prime minister Coisi, who was at the same time chief priest of his ancient religion. This pontif, being a man of moderation and good understanding, joined the queen and Paulinus, declared in favour of Christianity, and with his own hands de∣molished the idols which he had formerly adored. Such a remarkable instance of conviction had a wonderful effect upon the king, who was soon after bap∣tized, with al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his court, at York, of which he created Paulinus bishop.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>His new religion did not seem to teach him humility; for, he grew every day more and more absolute and imperious, and on solemn occasions or∣dered a globe to be carried before him, to denote the union of the heptarchy un∣der his sovereign command. His ambition and insolence of power excited the jealousy and resentment of all the Anglo-Saxon princes; and in particular in∣flamed the indignation of Penda the Mercian king, who was naturally fierce and impatient, and longed passionately for an occasion to shake off the dominion of the Northumbrian monarch. Nor did he long wait for an opportunity: Cead∣walla king of the Britons, whom he had distressed and saddled with a tribute, conferred with Penda upon their mutual disgrace in submitting to the sway of a prince, who was in no respect their superior; and finding their sentiments agree upon the subject, resolved to dispute his preheminence. With this view they immediately joined their forces, and advanced as far as Hatfield, in the west-riding of Yorkshire, where they found Edwin ready to give them battle. The engagement began with desperate fury on both sides; and though the con∣federat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s had greatly the advantage in number, they in all probability would have yielded at last to the capacity of Edwin and the discipline of his troops, had not an accident deprived him of that cool deliberation and presence of mind, which he had hitherto preserved. His son Offrid fell at his feet transfixed with
<PB N="105" REF="1140"/>
an arrow; and this spectacle filled his breast with tumults of rage and distraction. Without regarding the posture of his men, or the disposition of the battle, he rushed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 633.</NOTE> singly into the thickest body of the enemy; and his retreat being cut off, was immediately dispatched by a multitude of weapons. When their king disappeared, the Northumbrians were seized with consternation, and abandoned the field of battle, leaving a compleat victory to the allies, which they prosecuted with the utmost inhumanity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Northumberland being in no condition to resist their arms, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣vaged the whole country with fire and sword; and the British prince, who pro∣sessed christianity, acted like a savage beast of prey thirsting after human blood. Effrid the son of Edwin dreading the sanguinary disposition of this brutal mon∣ster, surrendered himself to the king of Mercia, who received him at first with some decree of humanity, and afterwards ordered him to be butchered in his pre∣sence: As for queen Ethelburga, she fled with Paulinus to her brother the Kentish<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.

<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>The Northumbrians, driven to despair by the barbarity of their con∣querors, resolved to perish sword in hand, rather than fall tamely the victims of such inhuman tyrants; and, in order to make a last effort to retrieve their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ber∣ty, the people of Deira chose Osrick, a relation of Edwin, for their king; while the Bernicians placed upon their throne Anfrid, the son of Ethelfrid, who, after his father's death, had fled with his brothers Oswald and Oswy into Scotland, where all three had embraced the Christian religion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 633.</NOTE></P>
<P>These two kings were no sooner established on their thrones, than they re∣turned to their pagan worship; though they did not long survive their apostacy. Osrick having rashly presumed to besiege Ceadwalla in York, the British prince made a furious sally, routed the besiegers with great slaughter, and left their new king lying dead upon the spot; then he marched against the sovereign of Ber∣nicia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. l. i.</NOTE> whom he attacked by surprize, and made a terrible carnage, in the midst of which Anfrid lost his life.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>These victories were attended with horrible cruelties and all species of op∣pression, exercised against the Northumbrians, by Ceadwalla, who now treated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Their groans reached the ears of Oswald, still an exile in Scot∣land, who formed the generous resolution of relieving the distress of his country∣men, tho' at the extreme hazard of his life; for that purpose he collected an hand∣ful of men, and marched against the tyrant, who looking upon him with in∣finite contempt, went forth to meet him in full assurance of victory. Oswald, being informed of his approach, intrenched himself in an advantageous post at Halidown, and erecting a cross in the front of his camp, commanded the whole army to fall upon their knees, and implore the assistance of heaven. Animated by this act of devotion, they waited with fortitude for the assault; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadwalla, advancing at the head of his troops, in order to force their intrenchments, re∣ceived an arrow in his heart, which instantly put an end to his life. This acci∣dent overwhelmed his forces with consternation: confusion ensued; then the Nor∣thumbrians taking advantage of their disorder, sallied from their camp, and fell upon them with such vigour, that they were entirely routed. A defeat in
<PB N="106" REF="1150"/>
which Oswald thought the hand of the Lord was so manifest on his side, that he called the place on which the battle was fought Heossenfelt, or Heaven's field.</P>

<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. iii.</NOTE> By this great victory, Oswald was put in possession of the two Northum∣brian kingdoms, to both which he was heir by his father Ethelfrid, and his mo∣ther Acca, who was Edwin's sister. He began his reign with the establish∣ment of excellent regulations; so that the people soon forgot the calamities they had undergone. Being a prince of natural capacity, cultivated with pro∣per education, he took effectual measures for softening and polishing the manners of his rude Northumbrians; and lost no opportunity of propagating Christianity, and promoting the interests of the church. His learning was ex∣tensive, and his charity unlimited; insomuch that it was his constant practice to send food to the poor from his own table; and he frequently ordered the silver dishes that contained it to be broken and divided among the necessitous. Such virtue could not fail to win the affections of his people: the clergy revered him as a saint, and the other Saxon princes raised him to the supreme command of their confederacy. The tranquillity and happiness of his reign was interrupt∣ed by the unquiet spirit of Penda the Mercian king, who, impatient of Oswald's character and superior station, resolved to destroy that prince, as the great obsta∣cle to his ambitious designs. He therefore suddenly assembled his forces, and began his march for Northumberland, where he hoped to find his rival unpre∣pared. This was really the case with Oswald, who nevertheless advanced against him with the small number of troops that were at hand, and lost his life in the battle that ensued, at a place which thence took the name of Os∣westre.</P>
<P>The victor used his good fortune with all that insolence and barbarity which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 642.</NOTE> was peculiar to his character: he ordered the body of Oswald to be cut in pieces, and exposed upon poles in the middle of the field; then he laid waste the whole country of North<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mberland; and undertook the siege of Bambury, which was built by Ida. But meeting with more resistance than he expected, he desisted from the enterprize, and directed his march towards East Anglia, which he hoped to subdue by the terror of his arms.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>His retreat afforded breathing time to the Northumbrians, who saw<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 643.</NOTE> no safety but under the shadow of regal authority; and therefore the Bernici∣ans filled their throne with Oswy the brother of Oswald, while the Deirians pre∣sented their crown to Oswin the son of Osrick, who had been defeated and slain by Ceadwalla.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>A very good understanding subsisted between these two princes, while they dreaded a fresh invasion from Penda; but, as soon as he was engaged in other wars, Oswy resolved to make himself master of his brother's whole suc∣cession. Oswin, who was a prince of mean parts and great devotion, endea∣voured by divers pacific proposals to divert Oswy from his purpose; and these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roving ineffectual, he was obliged at last to have recourse to arms: but, before the armies came in sight of each other, he was so shocked at the prospect of shedding christian blood, that he resolved to retire into a convent, and in the mean time withdrawing privately from his troops, he repaired to the house of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, l. iii.</NOTE> count, whom he believed a faithful adherent; and that traitor betrayed him to Oswy, who cruelly deprived him of his life. Yet this ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>barous homicide did not answer his expec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion; for, the Deirians detesting the action, and dreading
<PB N="107" REF="1160"/>
the government of such a bloody tyrant, immediately chose a successor to Oswin in the person of Athelwalt, son of the illustrious Oswald, a prince better calculated than his predecessor, for wielding the sceptre of Northumberland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>As he knew the disposition and claim of his uncle Oswy, he re∣solved to support his own pretensions by means of alliances, and gladly listened to the proposals of the East Anglian king, and Penda, who, though turned of seventy-eight, retained his enmity to the Northumbrians, and projected a league against Oswy, in which Athelwalt readily engaged. The king of Bernicia, alarmed at this alliance, omitted no step which he thought could avert the storm, and even offered a sum of money to Penda, provided he would desist from his enterprise. But finding the confederates deaf to all his proposals, he began to make preparations for his own defence; and obliged himself by a vow to found twelve monasteries, and make one of his daughters a nun, in case God should maintain his cause against such powerful enemies. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. l. i.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The opposite armies met on the banks of the Aar, in Yorkshire; but by that time Athelwalt reflecting that he should, in all probability, become a prey to the conqueror, whether victory should declare for Penda or for Oswy, he resolved to stand neuter during the engagement, that he might be in a con∣dition to defend himself from the designs of the victor. Penda and the East Anglian king, without suspecting his intention, attacked the Bernicians with great fury: but their forces perceiving Athelwalt wheeling off with his Nor∣thumbrians, concluded themselves betrayed, and giving ground immediately, their two chiefs were slain in endeavouring to rally and bring them back to the charge. Immediately after this battle, which was fought at a place called Win∣field, Oswy penetrated into Mercia, which he subdued without opposition, the sons of Penda being obliged to fly for refuge into another kingdom: this con∣quest he enjoyed about three years, during which he was elected chief of the Saxon confederacy, station which had remained unfilled since the death of his brother Oswald; but, at length his officers exercised such severities in Mercia, that the natives took to their arms, and driving the Northumbrians out of the kingdom, placed Wolpher, the son of Penda, upon the throne.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Oswy, however, soon consoled himself for this loss, with the ac∣quisition<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 670.</NOTE> of Deira, in which he succeeded Athelwalt, who died without issue. But this reunion of the kingdoms was not of long duration; for, Oswy be∣stowed Deira upon his natural son Alfrid, and died in peace, after a reign of eight and twenty years, the beginning of which had been full of trouble, and stained by the criminal effects of his amb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion: but he afterwards compound∣ed with heaven, by the religious performance of his vows, and erecting a mo∣nastery on the spot where Oswin was murdered; and the venerable Bede ranks him among the best and most illustrious princes of the Saxon heptarchy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was succeeded in the double dignity of Saxon monarch and king of Nor∣thumberland, by his son Eg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rid, under whom Deira and Bernicia were again united; for the death of Oswy was no sooner known to the Deirians, than they revolted against Alfrid, who retired into Ireland, and devoted his time to study, until he should find a favourable opportunity to retrieve his fortune.</P>

<P>Egfrid was a prince of great activity and ambition. Being invaded by Wolpher, king of Mercia, he compelled him to retire to his own dominions, with considerable loss. By the persuasion of his wife Ermenburga, he expelled
<PB N="108" REF="1170"/>
bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>op Wilfred from his see, on account of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>idious pride and dangerous influence of that p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ela<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The sentence was executed by the archbishop of Can∣terbury and three other bishops; and Wilfred appealed to the pope, who de∣creed in full synod that he should be restored to his see; but Egfrid set the pope and his decree at defiance. This enterprising prince resolving to make a con∣quest of Ireland, sent an army into that island, under the command of one Bert∣frid, who ravaged the country, plundered and destroyed churches and monas∣teries, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naffacred the inhabitants without mercy or distinction. This con∣duct ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sperated the Irish to such a degree, that though at first they were dis∣posed to submit, they had now recourse to their arms, which they used so ef∣fectually, that the invader was fain to reimbark his army, after having sustained considerable damage Egfrid, disappointed in this quarter, turned his arms to∣wards Scotland, in direct violation of the treaty he had concluded with the Scottish king Eugenius, and in conjunction with the Picts, wasted that country as far as Galloway with fire and sword. But Eugenius was prepared for his re∣ception, and found means to detach the Picts from his interest, then attacked him with such impetuosity, that his army was cut in pieces, and himself so wounded that he could scarce escape to his own dominions. Next year, in order<NOTE PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chanan, l. v.</NOTE> to be revenged upon the Picts for their treachery, he advanced into their coun∣try, and the enemy fled before him, until he was drawn into an ambuscade, among marshes, woods, and mountains; then they fell upon him with great fury, and he lost his army and his life together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The regal power now devolved to Mollo-Ethelwald, although he was not of the blood royal, and his election was productive of calamities, which ended in the ruin of the kingdom; for, no sooner did the Northumbrians disregard the royal family in the choice of their king, than every powerful nobleman thought himself as well intitled to the throne as another; and began

This prince, in order to secure his authority, by the destruction of that faction which had supported his predecessor, made use of very slender pretences for putting to death three principal noblemen, who had opposed his election; and this violence, far from answering his expectation, served only to forward the machinations of his enemies, by furnishing them with a pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible pretext for revolting.

<P>During the reign of Ethelred, the Danes made a descent upon Nor∣thumberland, where they burned the monastery of Lindis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arne.

<P>Ethelred still giving way to his jealousy and revenge, continued to devise means for compassing the death or exile of his most formidable subjects; and at length ventured to banish Ardulph, one of the first noblemen of the kingdom; an act of violence that produced an open rebellion and civil war, which raged two years, with various success, until the revolters, tired of such a tedious process, had recourse to the expedient of assassination, which freed them from the tyran∣ny of Ethelred, but could not prevent the crown's falling into the hands of Os∣bald, who had been a stanch adherent of the deceased king.

His death occasioned an open insurrection, coun∣tenanced and conducted by a nobleman called Aldrick, who being vanquished and slain, the kingdom enjoyed a little respite. But, the malecontents increased daily to such a degree both in number and power, that Ardulph thought him∣self happy in accomplishing his escape from his own dominions, and took refuge in the court of Charlemagne, where the English always met with a favourable reception.

<P>THE kingdom of Mercia was separated from Northumberland by the river Humber, and extended westerly to the Severne; it was parted by the Thames on the south from the kingdom of Kent, Sussex, and Wessex; and bounded on the east by Essex and East Anglia. The extent of it amounted to about one hundred and sixty miles, and its greatest breadth to an hundred. The principal towns were Lincoln, Nottingham, Warwick, Leicester, Coven∣try, Lichfield, Northampton, Worcester, Gloucester, Derby, Chester, Shrews∣bury,
<PB N="114" REF="1230"/>
Stafford, Oxford, and Bristol; in a word, it was the fairest and most considerable of all the kingdoms that composed the Saxon heptarchy, and owed its origin to Crida, who died in the first or second year of his reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 584</NOTE> At his death it was seized by Ethelbert king of Kent and chief of the Saxon confederacy, who afterwards restored it to Wibba son of Crida, as we have seen in the history of Kent.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> This prince, after a reign of nineteen years, left the kingdom to his son Penda, whom Ethelbert prevented from succeeding immediately, by giving the crown to Cearlus or Cheorl, cousin-german to the late king, whose reign of nine years is marked by no transaction of consequence. As he died without issue, the crown devolved upon Penda, already in the fiftieth year of his age, and it was not without reason he had been set aside by Ethelbert; for, he was the most tur∣bulent prince of his time, as the reader must by this time have perceived in the detail we have given of his wars with the other kingdoms of the heptarchy. We shall only observe upon this occasion, that his disposition seems to have been cruel, from his propensity to war, the dreadful ravages he committed, and the torrents of blood which he shed. He occasioned the death of five christian kings, and seems to have despised that religion; though we do not find that he prohibited the exercise of it in his dominions, or took the least offence at the conduct of his son Peada, who married the daughter of Oswy king of Northumberland, em∣braced the christian religion, and brought a great number of missionaries into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. iii.</NOTE> Mercia, where they preached the gospel with great success.</P>
<P>We have already related the manner in which he lost his life in the eightieth year of his age, leaving five sons, namely Peada, Wolpher, Ethelred, Mero∣wald, and Mercelin, besides two daughters called Cineburga, and Cinis∣wintha.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>After his defeat and death, Oswy the conqueror made himself master of the kingdom of Mercia, which he kept three years, permitting, however, his son-in-law Peada to enjoy the little kingdom of Leicester, which his father had erected into a sovereignty; but, this unhappy prince being afterwards poi∣soned by his own wife, her father Oswy took possession of his principality, and retained it in his hands, together with the rest of the Mercian kingdom, until it was wrested from him by the gallantry of Wolpher. The reign of this king was almost as tempestuous as that of his father; for, he was continually at war with his neighbours, though his enterprizes did not always succeed. Certain it is he reduced the isle of Wight, and afterwards bestowed it in a present upon Adelwalch, king of Sussex, whom he had made a prisoner, and converted to the Christian religion. In all probability he subdued the king of Essex, inas∣much as we know he disposed of the bishopric of London in favour of one<NOTE PLACE="marg">William of Malmesbury.</NOTE> Wina. We have already related how he fought an obstinate battle with Escuin, king of Wessex; and all that remains to be said of this prince, is, that after a reign of hurry and action, he bequeathed the crown to his son Kenrid, but he was supplanted by his uncle Ethelred.</P>

<P>This prince having successfully usurped his nephew's kingdom, dis∣membered it of Hereford, which he erected into an independent sovereignty, in favour of his brother Merowald, who dying without issue, left it to his young∣est brother; and when he died childless, it reverted to the kingdom of Mercia. As for Ethelred, he was a prince of a warlike genius, though not so ambitious
<PB N="115" REF="1240"/>
as his father and brother. His first exploit was in the kingdom of Kent, which he ravaged without opposition. Then he turned his arms against Egfrid, king of Northumberland, whom he defeated in battle, and compelled to give up Lindsey, which had been wrested from his predecessor. At last a peace was concluded between those two princes, through the mediation of Theodore, arch∣bishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 67<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of Canterbury, and Ethelred paid a sum of money to the Northumbrian king, in consideration of the death of his brother Escuin, who was slain in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede. l. iv.

<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>About this period, the states of Mercia, with their king's consent, di∣vided their country into the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ive dioceses of Worcester, Litchfield, Leicester, Lindsey or Cednacester, and Hereford: and Ethelred seemed to enjoy the tranquillity of his situation; when his queen Ostrithe was assassinated by the nor∣thern Mercians, who hated her because she was sister to the king of Northum∣berland; but, her husband was not exempted from the suspicion of being ac∣cessary to the murder, because he took no steps to discover and punish the as∣sassins. Whether his conscience upbraided him as the perpetrator or contriver of this barbarous action; or his mind was really captivated by the pleasures of private devotion, he resigned his crown to his nephew Kenrid, and became a monk in the monastery of Bardney, of which he was afterwards abbot. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. l. i.</NOTE></P>
<P>Kenrid, having reigned four years, followed the example of his predecessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This princess, instead of complying with the pro∣posal, persuaded her nephew and lover to renounce the vanity of the world and go to Rome, where they received the frock and tonsure from his holiness. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Kenrid was succeeded on the throne by his kinsman Ceolred, a prince of greater talents and activity, who supported a severe war against Ina, king of Wessex, with whom he fought a bloody battle at Woodensburg, in Wiltshire, in which neither side could claim the victory, though both sustained great da∣mage. Ceolred, far from imitating the devotion of his predecessors, treated the monks with infinite contempt, and even violated some privileges of the clergy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 716.</NOTE> no wonder then that his character was aspersed, and his life treacherously taken away by poison; the effects of which were so violent, that he died in a deliri∣um, which supplied the honest monks with a pretence to say, he gave up the ghost, blaspheming and conversing with the devil. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist.

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>He was succeeded by Ethelbald, grandson of Eoppa, who was Penda's brother. This was one of the most illustrious princes who reigned in Mercia, and was chosen chief of the Saxon confederacy, after Ina king of Wessex had ab∣dicated his crown. But his ambition increased with his power, and he seemed to consider that as an absolute sovereignty, which was no other than a privi∣lege of presiding at general assemblies, and of commanding the united forces of the Anglo-Saxons, whenever they should take the field against the common ene∣my. Ethelbald, in assuming an authority to which he had no claim, incurred the jealousy and hatred of the other Saxon princes, and the kings of Wessex and Nor∣thumberland engaged in a league to humble his insolence. Ethelbald being apprised of their alliance and intention, assembled his forces, and invaded Northumber∣land, from whence he returned loaded with plunder. In the mean time his own do∣minions were attacked by Ethelhard, king of Wessex, who had already routed a bo∣dy of his troops commanded by his son Oswald; so that he advanced in order to

Having established himself securely on the throne, he glowed with the ambition of rendering his name famous for military exploits, and marched into Kent, whose king Aldric he vanquished and slew with his own hand at O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford.

<P>He was in the sequel engaged in a war with Alcmun, another king of Kent, whom he reduced to obedience. He gained the advantage over Kinewulph, king of the West Saxons, near Bensington or Benson, which fell into his hands. He invaded and ravaged Northumberland; and his success alarmed all the princes of the heptarchy, who began to take measures for their own preservation. The Britons, taking the opportunity of these dissensions, made sudden inroads upon the English, which, as they were unexpected, were successful. Offa, in whose territories they had gained some footing, compromised matters with the Saxon princes; then turning his arms against those invaders, not only com∣pelled them to abandon the conquests they had made in Mercia, but even drove them out of part of their own country on the other side of the Severne, and settled it with English colonies, for whose defence he raised a strong ram∣part,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> provided with a deep ditch, extending eighty thousand paces, from the mouth of the river Dee to the confluence of the Wye and the Severne.</P>

But all his glory was tar∣nished by the murder of Ethelbert, king of East Anglia, whom he had invited to his court on pretence of making him his son-in-law, and there, at the insti∣gation of his wife Quindrida, assassinated the unhappy prince, in violation of the most sacred rights of hospitality.

<PB N="117" REF="1260"/>
the tax of Romescot over all Mercia and East-Anglia; so that the alms originally intended for the support of the English college, was now converted in∣to a tribute for the pope's use: because it was payed on the festival of St. Peter ad Vincula, it acquired the name of Peter's Pence; and was constantly levied, to the disgrace of this nation, until Henry VIII. abolished the shameful impo∣sition.</P>

He no sooner ascended the throne than he assembled an army, and marched against Egbert-Pren king of Kent, though the cause of the quarrel is unknown; and not only defeated and took that prince prisoner, but even ordered his eyes to be put out, and placed another king upon his throne, which was thus rendered dependent upon the Mercian sovereign. Kenulf died, after a glorious reign of four and twenty years, leaving a young son named Kenelm, and two daughters called Quendrida and Burgamida.</P>

He was indeed consecrated as such at Arles, to which he made a voyage for that pur∣pose; and at his return to Britain he sent Laurentius, with a monk called Peter, to make the pope acquainted with the success of his labours, and desire his opi∣nion and direction touching certain points relating to the behaviour of the bishops and clergy. His holiness having considered and replied to the questions, which with their answers may be seen in Bede's history of the church, sent over Meli∣tus, Paulus, Justus, Melinus, and Rufinianus, to assist him in converting the Saxons; at the same time he transmitted directions about erecting sees among the new converts, and a pall for Augustin, which is an undyed piece of woolen cloth, laid upon St. Peter's tomb by the pope's own hand, and worn over the shoulders, by metropolitans when they officiate. Augustin was likewise permitted by his master to convert the pagan temples into christian churches, after due purification, and to institute anniversary festivals of saints and con∣secrations, upon which the good people should build booths, around those places of worship, kill oxen, eat, drink, and be merry with moderation. A very singular indulgence, judiciously granted to the English, who were used to good chear, and would not have at first relished the practice of fasting and other mortifications.</P>

<P>As for Ethelbert he was become so zealous a convert, that he be∣queathed his own palace to the church and retired to Reculver, that Augustin might be more at his ease in Canterbury. Notwithstanding all these favours, and the princely magnificence in which he lived, his pious apostle could enjoy no content while the British clergy, lived independent of his authority, and un∣subjected to the see of Rome.</P>
<P>He employed all his art and industry to sound and soothe their prelates into a conformity with the Roman church; and at last they consented to a conference, which was held at a place since called Augustin's Ac, in Worcestershire, where they found his behaviour so arrogant, his pretensions so high, and his merit so small, that they rejected his proposal, of giving up their independency, even though he confirmed the claim of the Roman church by miraculously restor∣ing to sight a Saxon convert of his own tutoring, who in all probability was not blind. That they might not, however, incur the charge of obstinacy, they desired another conference, resolving to deliberate upon an affair of such consequence; and Augustin agreeing to the proposal, they consulted a venera∣ble<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii. c. 2.</NOTE> hermit, who told them they might look upon Augustin as a man of God, if he was of a meek and lowly spirit, and behaved with that humility, which ought to distinguish the followers of Christ. Persuaded that this was the real criterion of true holiness, they, by the advice of this sage counsellor, de∣layed appearing at the place of appointment, until they knew he was arrived, and then entering, they were received with all the state and haughtiness of a Roman emperor. He did not even rise from his seat at their approach, but, in∣sisted in a peremptory manner, that they should keep the festival of Easter, and administer the sacrament of baptism, after the manner of the Roman church. Far from being convinced by his arguments, and assured by his insolence that his call was not from above, they stedfastly persisted in refusing to conform with the
<PB N="120" REF="1290"/>
Romish church, and to pay any other obedience to the bishop of Rome, than that which one Christian owes to another in meekness and charity: at the same time they declared that the administration and supremacy of their church was under<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelman.</NOTE> God, vested in the bishop of Kaerleon. Augustin, incensed at this declaration, threatened, since they refused to live in unity with him and his brethren, that they should be delivered into the hands of their enemies; and in all likelihood exe∣cuted his menaces, by instigating the king of Northumberland to destroy their seminary, and put them all to the sword, as we have seen in the history of that kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The archbishops of Canterbury not only endeavoured to extend their jurisdiction over the British church, but also to reduce the Scottish clergy to the dominion of the pope. Theodore, a Greek, having been promoted to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> see of Canterbury, held a synod at Harford, where, among other particulars in the book of canons, to be diligently observed, he insisted upon their keeping Easter, according to the literal direction, on the Sunday after the fourteenth day of the moon in the first month. This was a stroke aimed at the Britons and Scots, who celebrated that festival by another rule, and two bishops from Icolm∣kill had prevailed upon the Northumbrians to adopt their usage in this respect, though they had been converted by Roman missionaries. Oswy, king of that country, considering the difference as a subject of great importance, pro∣posed a conference at Whitby in Yorkshire, between Colman, one of the Scottish prelates, supported by several monks of his nation, and Wilfred, who had already brought over the queen to his opinion.

<P>We have observed that Sebba, king of the East Angles, became a monk under the direction of Walder, bishop of London; during his retirement he expended a large sum of money in pious uses, and was of such delicacy of dis∣position, that finding his last hour approaching, he desired that no person should be allowed to see him die, but the bishop and two of his own domestics, left he should in his last agonies betray the weakness of human nature; but he preserved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Lutherius, bishop of the West Saxons, dying about this period, his place was filled with Heddi, consecrated by Theodore, who exerted his au∣thority even to the deposition of bishops, in the case of Winfred bishop of the Mer∣cians, whom he removed from his see, appointing Sexwulf as his successor. To this prelate Putta bishop of Rochester fled for shelter, when Kent was in∣vaded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

During the reign of Egfrid in Northumberland, Wilfred archbishop of York had acquired such influence over the mind of the queen, that her husband had recourse to his mediation, by which he hoped to over∣come a fanatical delicacy in this princess, that deprived him of the conjugal rites. Wilfred, instead of arguing her out of this ridiculous scruple, seems to have applauded her conduct; for, she received the veil from his hands, and reti∣red
<PB N="122" REF="1310"/>
into a monastery, from whence she afterwards fled to Ely from the importu∣nities of her husband.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Her inflexible obstinacy cured him of his passion, and he married Ermenburga, a princess of a very different complexion, who confirmed the king in his resentment against Wilfred, whom he was resolved to humble for his arrogance and presumption: but the power and interest of this prelate was so great, that he would not venture to attack him openly, until he had effected a rupture between Wilfred and Theodore, who at Egfrid's request, erected several new bishoprics in the diocese of York, without the consent of the bishop. Wil∣fred, enraged at this innovation, exclaimed bitterly against the metropolitan and the king, and demanded the revenues which had been converted to the mainte∣nance of the new prelates. The king insisted upon the rectitude and legality of the steps he had taken, and Wilfred appealed to the decision of Rome, whi∣ther he went in person, and presented a servile petition to the pope and council assembled for the purpose. In return for the gross incense he offered to Pope Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tho, he obtained a decree for being reinstated in his bishopric, on pain of excommunication to all those who should oppose his restoration. Wilfred im∣mediately returned to England, in full confidence of recovering all that he had lost. When he delivered his credentials to Egfrid, that prince summoned a general council of the clergy and laity, who asserted their independence of Rome; and Egfrid, finding himself supported by the opinion of his subjects, sent Wilfred to prison, where he lay a whole year, until his release was obtained by the in∣tercession of the abbess Ebba, a lady of the royal family. But, this favour being granted on condition that he should immediately quit the kingdom, he re∣tired to Mercia, from whence he was driven by king Ethelred, who dreaded the displeasure of the Northumbrian monarch. He was also obliged to leave the country of the West Saxons; and then took up his habitation among the South Saxons, where, as we have formerly observed, he acquired great influence and power.</P>
<P>Perhaps it was in consequence of his success, that Theodore invited him to a conference, in which all differences were compromised, and the archbishop of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede.

<P>Tho' now turned of seventy, he made another journey to Rome, where he was again acquitted in full synod, and furnished with letters of recom∣mendation to the kings of Mercia and Northumberland.

After the death of this prince, he endeavoured to introduce himself under the reign of Eadwulf, who rejected his proposals and expelled him from his dominions. Nevertheless, he had by this time retrieved his interest in that kingdom to such a degree, that immediately after the revolution which ensued, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found himself as much fa∣voured by the new ministry as he had been detested by the former king.</P>

<P>The archbishop of Canterbury thinking it was now high time to accommodate matters with a priest of such interest and aspiring ambition, con∣voked a council near the river Nid, now in Scotland; and there it was decreed that John bishop of Hexham should be translated to the see of York, vacant by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede, l. ii.</NOTE> the death of Bosa; and that Wilfred should not only succeed to the bishopric of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In the course of the same year there was a synod at Alne, convoked at the instance of Egwin bishop of Worcester, who by a grant from the pope had built a monastery at Evesham, the privileges of which we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed by this council. This is the prelate who is said to have been the occasion of introducing image-worship into England, by a vision of the virgin Ma∣ry, who commanded him to set up her image in his cathedral. But, the charters brought in support of this assertion, have been clearly convicted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>From the council of Nid, however, the Roman power continued to gain ground every day in the British church. Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborn, wrote a book against the British manner of celebrating Easter; a performance which made a number of proselytes; and one Egbert, an Englishman, persuaded the monks of Jona, one of the western isles of Scotland, to adopt the Romish Easte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

These came on pretence of reforming the discipline of the English church, and executing the partition of the metropolitanical power of Canterbury. A sy∣nod was accordingly held in Northumberland, and gave assent to all the articles which had been already prepared by the legates: these were in effect little more than a confirmation of canons, which had formerly received the sanction of the

The decrees of this synod were afterwards con∣firmed by another council convened at Calcluith, which was more frequent and full than the other; and Adulph received the pall from Rome, without Lam∣bart's daring to murmur, for fear of being impeached of treasonable practices.

<P>Lambart was succeeded in the archbishopric of Canterbury by Athelard, who had been bishop of Winchester; a man of learning and influ∣ence among the nobility, who had well nigh prevailed upon Egser, son and successor of Offa, to restore the see of Canterbury to its former power and pre∣rogatives, when that prince was taken off by an untimely death. He carried his point, however, in the succeeding reign of Kenulf, who being willing to deliver himself from the power of a metropolitan, lent an ear to the remon∣strances of Athelard, and even recommended his cause to the pope in a sub∣missive letter, which the archbishop delivered with his own hand. His request was granted, and he obtained a restitution of all that had been dismembered from his see: while Adulph was, at the intercession of Alcuin, allowed to pre∣serve the pall, though deprived of the power of consecrating bishops, or exer∣cising<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

Kenulph had quarrelled with Wulfrid about the manor of Leonesham, which the prelate at length consented to give up, on condition of his being restored, by the king's intercession, to his metropolitan rights, of which he had been deprived by the pope: otherwise he should be possessed of his lands again. Kenulf died before he could perform his part of the agreement, and his daughter, the abbess, occu∣pied the lands that were now claimed by the archbishop.

<P>WE have already observed that the pacific Brithric was no sooner<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> dead, than the West-Saxons sent a deputation to Egbert; in conse∣quence of which, he returned and mounted the throne of Wessex, and began to reign over a people both rich and powerful, in whose affluence and affection he foresaw his own future greatness. He had, in all probability, already planned the union of the heptarchy; but before he would impart the least hint of that design to the other Saxon nations, he resolved to humble the Britons in such a
<PB N="128" REF="1370"/>
manner, that they should be in no condition to interfere with the execution of his grand project. Mean while, in order to aver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the suspicion of the Saxons, he acted as mediator in all the differences subsisting between the princes of the heptarchy, and in particular effected a reconciliation between Eardulf, king of Northumberland, and Kenulf, king of Mercia, who had taken the field against each other, and were on the eve of terminating their quarrel by the sword.</P>
<P>These good offices employed with such moderation, the prudence he manifest∣ed in his own government, and his known capacity in the affairs of war and peace, raised his character to such a degree of reputation, that he was considered as the father of the English kings, and chosen chief of the Saxon heptarchy.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus established himself in the good opinion of his countrymen, he assembled an army, and marched against the Britons of Cornwall, whom he<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Weft. An.

The rapidity of his success alarming Beornulf, king of Mercia, whose dominions lay contiguous to his conquests, that prince took the opportunity of his absence to invade his kingdom; confiding, perhaps, in an alliance he had formed with the Britons, against the dangerous power and ambition of Egbert.</P>

<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>This enterprising monarch was not sorry to hear that the Mercian king had furnished him with an handle to recover the provinces which Offa had wrested from the West-Saxons, and even to break the power of that kingdom, which was the chief obstacle to the execution of his vast designs: he therefore advanced against Beornulf, who met him at Ellandine, now Wilton, with a numerous army composed of lusty young men, who looked with contempt upon the diminutive meagre followers of the West-Saxon monarch. A battle imme∣diately ensued, and was fought for a long time with doubtful success; but at last the conduct and discipline of Egbert prevailed, and the Mercians were de∣feated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> with terrible slaughter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The victor, instead of pursuing Beornulf immediately into his own country, detached his son Ethelwulf, Alstan, bishop of Sherborn, and Wulf∣heard, one of his eoldermen, with a body of troops into Kent, the people of which paid a very unwilling obedience to Baldred, whom they considered as no more than the Mercian deputy. And indeed that prince justified their contempt of his administration, by flying to the other side of the Thames, without having<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. Sax. ad An. 823.</NOTE> made any opposit on to the invaders, whom he left in full possession of the king∣dom. The East-Saxons and part of Surry belonging to them, or to the Mercian monarch, dissatisfied with the nature of their subjection to a people by whom they were oppressed, readily submitted to Egbert; and the East-Angles sent ambassadors to crave his protection and assistance against that nation, whose yoke they resolved no longer to bear.</P>

<P>Beornulf, instead of running the risque of another overthrow from Eg∣bert, marched to the other extremity of his dominions, in order to quell this revolt of the East-Angles, by whom he was cefeated and slain: though the Mercians, even in this emergency, would not give up the kingdom of East-An∣glia, which had been acquired by persidy and murder; but, laying aside their intestine animosities, united in conferring the sovereign power upon a kinsman of their late king, called Luduan, who having collected a body of forces, ad∣vanced

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The Mercians, not yet totally humbled by the successive calamities which had befallen them, still refused to submit to the dominion of Egbert, but raised to the throne one Withlaf, their eolderman, who could not withstand the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

His misfortunes, however, excited the compassion of the conqueror, who in the course of the suc∣ceeding year restored him to the government; which, nevertheless, he held as<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 827.</NOTE> a vassal and tributary. Thus Egbert's humanity and interest happened to coin∣cide: for, the Mercians bore their subjection the more easily, as they were still indulged with that form of government to which they had been so long attached; and ruled by a prince of their own choosing, who was a man of some parts and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulf.</NOTE> great popularity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Egbert, having thus provided for the tranquillity of Mercia, was at leisure to prosecute his war with the Britons, who were unable to oppose such a general at the head of a veteran army, inured to conquest, especially as they were weakened by their own intestine divisions, particularly the war between Conan Tindaethwy prince of Guyneth and his younger brother Howel, who claimed Anglesey as his share of their father's inheritance<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">The custom of Gavel kind still prevailed among the Britons, by which, though the eld∣est succeeded to the honours of the father, all the rest claimed equal shares of the inheri∣tance.</NOTE>. Egbert, therefore, over∣ran the whole country without opposition; so that now he saw himself, either by conquest or voluntary submission, master of all the kingdoms on the south side of the Humber, and resolved to extend his dominion on the north side of that river. The Northumbrian kingdom had been for a long time distressed by civil wars and usurpation, which had destroyed all order, and weakened the kingdom to such a degree that they were in no condition to withstand such an invader as Eg∣bert, to whom they submitted when he had penetrated with his army as far as Dore in Yorkshire. By this submission all the seven provinces of the heptarchy<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> were united under his government; yet, in order to give a stronger sanction to his power, he summoned a general council of the clergy as well as laity at Win∣chester, where he was solemnly crowned king of Britain; and this ceremony was no sooner performed than he issued an edict for abolishing all distinctions among the Saxon kingdoms, and commanding that the united heptarchy should<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>He had now attained to the summit of glory; and saw the whole ex∣tent of South Britain subjected to his sway, and all the people enjoying in peace the fruits of his prudent administration. But this tranquillity was soon inter∣rupted by the descent of the Danes, who had already made some inconsiderable attempts upon different parts of the kingdom. They were a people com∣posed of different nations, inhabiting the countries of Jutland, Sweden, Den∣mark, and Norway, though they used the same language, customs, and hea∣thenish rites; and were prompted to undertake naval expeditions, by the plenty of wood and other necessaries for ship-building, which their country produced,
<PB N="130" REF="1390"/>
the poverty of the soil, the redundancy of their numbers, and the example of the Saxons, with whom they seem to have had one common origin; for, they nearly resembled that race in the ceremonies of their superstition, the make of their bodies, their insensibility of danger, their enterprizing courage, their savage∣ness of manners, their familiarity with the sea, their rapine, and cruelty of dispo∣sition. That there was, at least, a mixture of Saxons among them, appears from the testimony of the most authentic historians, who tell us, that a great number of Saxon pagans fled before the arms of Charlemagne into Jutland and other northern countries, where they settled, and in all probability first taught the natives to build ships, and gather the harvest of a pyratical navigation. This con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cture is justified by their constant practice during a series of years, of confining their ravages and depredations to the sea-coasts of that emperor's dominions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>We have already taken notice of their landing in small numbers, at different parts of this island, in quest of plunder; but those were inconsi∣derable attempts, in comparison with their invasions during the reign of Egbert. As the English had utterly neglected their naval power since they settled in Britain, the Danes, who succeeded them in the empire of the sea, found no difficulty in landing upon the isle of Sheppy in Kent, which they<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 831.</NOTE> ravaged, and returned to their ships laden with plunder, without having sus∣tained the least interruption. This success encouraged them to try their for∣tune next year at the mouth of the Tyne, where having received a small check, they hoisted sail, and cruising along the coast, made a descent at Charmouth in Dorsetshire, where they landed to the number of fifteen thousand men. Egbert was no sooner apprised of their appearance than he marched against them at the head of a small body of troops, which he thought sufficient to chastise a band of pilfering pyrates; but, notwithstanding the impetuosity of his attack, by which they were at first disordered, they gave him such a warm reception, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 83<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> he might have been entirely defeated, had not the approach of night prevented the completion of their victory, and enabled him to retire unmolested, after hav∣ing lost a great number of men, and among others two principal officers called Dudda and Osmund, with the bishops Herefrith and Wigen.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Yet far from being deterred from renewing hostilities, they within two years after this adventure equipped a great naval armament and landed in Corn∣wal, where being joined by the Britons, they advanced towards the borders of Devonshire, with a view to penetrate into the territories of Egbert, who gave them battle at Hengsdown hill near Kellington, where they were totally routed, and almost their whole united army cut in pieces. By this great victory he entirely wiped off the slight stain which had stuck to his reputation since the action at Charmouth, and death soon put his fame beyond the reach of fortune; for, he died in full glory, after having reigned six and thirty years, with such ability and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>He was succeeded by his son Ethelwulf, who had been educated in a cloister, and actually taken orders, during the life of his elder brother; but, that prince dying, Pope Leo granted him a dispensation to quit the monkish habit, and marry.

<PB N="131" REF="1400"/>
of personal courage in his father's expeditions against the Danes; but, he still retained an indolence of spirit, and an inclination for the repose of a monastic retreat. This, however, he could not expect to enjoy upon a throne, especially at a juncture when he was kept in continual alarms by the Danes, a bold, va∣liant, and indefatigable enemy.</P>

<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>In the very first year of his reign a body of those enterprizing pyrates arrived at Southampton, in three and thirty ships; they had scarce begun to ravage the country, when they were attacked and routed by Wulfheard, one of Ethel∣wulf's best generals, who died immediately after his success. Nay, before the troops could be dismissed, intelligence was brought that the Danes had made a descent at Portland, whither the army was ordered, under the command of Edelhelm, who attacked the invaders with great intrepidity, and at first disorder∣ed their battalions; but they rallied and returned to the charge with such fury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>In the course of the succeeding year, they landed at Romney, and defeated Herebert, an e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lderman, who was sent to oppose their progress; then penetrat∣ing farther into the country, they wasted Lindsey, East Anglia, and Kent, with great barbarity; and next year London, Canterbury, and Rochester, met with the same fate. Upon these occasions, their sole design was to obtain plunder, and they were generally opposed by the militia of the country in which they landed; so that they seldom or never found themselves under the necessity of withstanding the whole united force of the realm, as they always reim∣barked with their spoil before the people whom they pillaged could be proper∣ly sustained.</P>

<P>At length, however, they resolved to make a settlement in the fertile<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The landing of such a numerous body could not fail to alarm the indolent Ethelwulf; and the steps they immediately took for securing a settlement, effectually roused him from his lethargy. He assembled his forces without delay, and advanced in person against those inter∣lopers; but, as if the spot had been unfortunately ominous to his family, he was, after a very obstinate engagement, obliged to leave the enemy in possession of the field, though, even at this time, they did not think proper to maintain the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Sax.</NOTE> footing they had gained <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">It was about that period, (if we may be∣lieve the Scottish historians) that the difference began between the Scots and Picts, which ter∣minated in the extirpation of the Pictish nation. This people had routed the Scots under their king Alpin, and treated the dead body of that prince with great indignity. A circumstance, which exasperated his son and successor Ken∣neth to such a degree, that his kingdom had no sooner recovered the loss they had sustained in the last battle, than he marched against the e∣nemy, where, reinforced with a body of Nor∣thumbrians, and having obtained a compleat victory, he ordered all the men able to carry arms to be put to the sword, and the rest to be expel∣led the kingdom. Such a total extirpation re∣flects very little honour on the memory of Kenneth, and the account of it has all the air of a romance. That the Picts were utterly sub∣dued, and their kingdom seized by the victor, is not to be disputed; but that they were not utterly exterminated, or even wholly united with the Scots, so as to lose their name and language, appears from the silence of the Eng∣lish historians, who would not have failed to take notice of the entire destruction of such an antient and warlike people: besides, Asse∣rius Menevensis, as we are told by Mr. Innes, who lived near this period, far from mentioning this event, says the Picts were harrassed by the Danes in the year 875; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, Ethelred, in his chronicle, and his cotemporary Ingulphus, af∣frm, that the Picts constituted part of the army of Constantine king of Albany at the battle of Brunford, against A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helstan king of the Saxons, in the year 937.

<P>The battle of Okely, tho' it did not deter the Danes from renewing their descents, at least supplied Ethelwulf with leisure and opportunity to in∣dulge his natural inclination for the conversation of monks, and the duties or rather bigotry of devotion. His confidence was shared between two prelates of very different characters: these were Swithin bishop of Winchester, and Alstan bishop of Sherburn. The first by soothing his natural indolence, en∣deavoured to detach him from the vanities of the world, and discoursed of no∣thing but the joys of paradise; while the other, animated him by proper incen∣tives, to support the glory of his family, and take measures to secure his realms<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 853.</NOTE> against invasion: thus they ruled the heart of the king by turns. When the Danes alarmed the country, he was directed by the councils of Alstan; but, in time of peace, he gave himself wholly up to the suggestions of Swithin, who inspired him with such veneration for the church and the clergy, that his mu∣nificence to both degenerated into the most excessive profusion.</P>

<P>In order to manifest his devotion to the pope, he sent his son Alfred, then a boy just turned of five, to receive confirmation from the hands of his holiness, who is said to have anointed him as a chosen vessel, and prognostica∣ted his future greatness; and not satisfied with this testimony of his zeal, he un∣dertook a journey in person to Rome, where he was received with particular marks of distinction by pope Leo IV; and in his turn gave that pontif the most substantial proofs of his submission and regard. He rebuilt the English college, which had been reduced to ashes; engaged to extend the romescot or St. Peter's pence over his whole kingdom, and saddled himself besides with a yearly tribute of three hundred marks, two thirds of which were appropriated for defraying the expence of tapers for the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul; and the remain∣der for the pope's own private occasions. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Asser.

<P>While Ethelwulf thus imprudently gratified the dictates of his su∣perstition and love, he seemed wholly to neglect the interest of his kingdom, which he had left exposed to the insults of a rapacious enemy, without even ap∣pointing a regency to govern the state in his absence. The Surrymen and inha∣bitants of Kent, commanded by Alcher and Huda, attempted to drive the Danes from the isle of Thanet, where they had made a kind of settlement; and in that hope attacked them with great intrepidity; but the victory, after a very bloody engagement, declared for the Danes, and the two English noblemen lost their lives in the battle. After this advantage the Danes became more and more dangerous and enterprising, and bishop Alstan fearing the nation would be ruined by the indolence, mismanagement, and mad superstition of a weak mo∣narch, who had already given away a tythe of all the lands to the clergy; Al∣stan, I say, being moved by these considerations, and, in all probability, piqued at the ascendancy which his rival had gained over Ethelwulf, engaged, together with Eanwulf, earl of Somerset, in a conspiracy with the king's son Ethelbald, who had been a male-content, since the death of his elder brother Athelstan, be∣cause he did not succeed that prince on the throne of Kent. Thus prepared with disgust and ambition, he was easily persuaded to adopt the measures pro∣posed by Alstan, who represented that the old king was in his dotage, that the kingdom was left naked to invasion; that Ethelbald was injured and dishonour∣ed in being denied the succession of his brother; and that in all probability, should this new marriage produce any children, they would be preferred to the issue of the first marriage, in complaisance to a young wife, and the power and interest of her father. These suggestions not only reconciled Ethelbald to the expedi∣ency of preventing his father's return, but likewise had a great weight among the nobility and people; so that a strong faction was formed before Ethelwulf had the least intimation of their design.</P>

Every thing now seemed to threaten a civil war, when some of the principal noblemen and prelates, foreseeing that such intestine commotions would expose them to inevitable ruin, threatened as they were by invaders, interposed their good offices, and effected an accommodation, in con∣sequence of which Ethelwulf ceded to his son Ethelbald the antient kingdom of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enev.

<P>The authority which Egbert had reserved over the kingdoms of Mer∣cia, East-Anglia, and Northumberland, had been lately much diminished by the intrusion of those savage pyrates, which obliged the kings of Wessex to concen∣trate their whole power for the defence of their own dominions; so that those three kingdoms began to withdraw themselves by little and little from the supremacy of Egbert's successors. The Northumbrians, as being the most remote, shook off their dependance entirely, and suppressing their former animosities, elevated Osbert to the throne, with the universal approbation of the people. By this union the kingdom would soon have been rendered as flourishing as ever; had not an unforeseen accident revived their former dissensions, and involved them in a gulf of confusion and calamity, from which they could not be extricated.</P>

The English monarch complained of this descent, as an infraction of the treaty; but was given to understand that the different bodies of Danes were independent of one another; and their several armaments fitted out at the expence of different companies of adventurers; so that any agreement made with one of those bands, could have no effect upon the operations of the others. Alfred, thus reduced to the necessity of repelling force by force, assem∣bled his troops without delay, and took the field with such confidence and ala∣crity, that Halden thought proper to sue for peace, and a treaty was concluded in the most solemn manner; the English king swearing upon the relics of the saints to observe it punctually, and the Danish general taking an oath to the same purport upon the bracelet, which was the most sacred object of the Danish adoration. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Asser.

Alfred equally incensed and concerned at the perfidious conduct of those pyrates, whom no ties of saith could restrain; and seeing the manifest advantage they had over him, in the convenience of their ships, by which they could not only receive supplies from their own country, but also transport themselves from one place to another occasionally, with such ease and expedition; resolved to provide himself with a navy, for the security of his coasts, and having invited artists from foreign countries, carried his plan into execution with such amazing diligence, that in a few months he was in possession of a powerful navy, composed of large vessels superior in strength and burden to the small Danish transports, and man∣ned with hardy Frisians, whom he had engaged in his service. With these, being reinforced by a sufficient number of troops, and supplied with all sorts of ne∣cessary stores and ammunition, he put to sea and attacked the Danish fleet, consisting of an hundred and twenty ships, bound for Exeter with men and pro∣visions, and destroyed their whole armada, while his army blocked up the town by land. This was such a decisive stroke, that the besieged, despairing of relief, had recourse to negociations, and Alfred consented to a peace, on condition, that they should give hostages, ratify the treaty by oath, and depart from his kingdom immediately. These proposals they willingly embraced, and retired forthwith into Mercia, in order to wait for an opportunity to recommence hosti∣lities with some prospect of success.</P>

<P>The West-Saxons were no sooner rid of this enemy, than visited by another, in the person of the famous Rollo, who landed on the coast; but ei∣ther finding the English prepared to give him a warm reception, or unwilling to interfere with the conquests of his countrymen, he re-imbarked and turned his arms against France, which he harrassed incessantly, until he made himself master of Normandy, where he fixed his habitation. As for the Danes, who

As they were well acquainted with the heroic valour, capacity, and fortitude of that prince, they prepared for this expedition with the utmost secrecy, and having assembled a prodigious army, poured in upon the kingdom like a deluge.

In order to prevent such depredations for the future, the English monarch equipped a strong fleet, with which he attacked and destroyed sixteen Danish ships in the port of Harwich; and protected the coast of his realm from those enterprizing free∣booters: at the same time he repaired the decayed castles on the sea side, and built a number of new fortifications, so as to cover his whole country from insult and invasion, except by one avenue, which he could not shut. This was the river Thames, through which the Danes had free access to his dominions, while they continued in possession of London. He therefore invested that city, which being weakly garrisoned, was easily reduced; and then having augmented its fortifications, and embellished it with a number of new edifices, he delivered it in charge to his son-in-law Ethelred, or rather bestowed it upon him as a fief<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>That he might be the better able to extend his charity and munifi∣cence, he regulated his finances with the most perfect oeconomy, and divided his revenue into a certain number of parts, which he appropriated to the diffe∣rent expences of the state, and the exercise of his own private liberality and de∣votion. Nor was he less an occonomist in the distribution of his time, which he divided into three equal portions, allotting one to sleep, meals, and exercise; and devoting the other two to writing, reading, business, and prayer. That this division might not be encroached upon through inadvertency, be measured them by tapers of an equal size, which he kept continually burning before the shrines of relicks. These were his constant companions wheresoever he travelled; and lest the tapers should be affected by the wind or other accidents, he con∣trived horn lanterns, in which they were equally consumed. But nothing de∣serves<NOTE PLACE="marg">Asser. vit.

He had invented a kind of galley wrought with oars, of such a construction, as rendered it an over∣match for any ship of war known at that period of time. Of these he had an hundred and twenty, which not only scoured the seas of the piratical Danes, and covered his coasts from invasion, but protected the commerce of his subjects, which flourished to a great extent: insomuch that the nation abounded with wealth, and all the richest commodities of India; from whence were imported

<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>The happiness and peace which the people of England enjoyed under the parental sway of this excellent prince, having lasted twelve years without interrup∣tion, was at length invaded by new alarms. The Danes, under Hastings, having sustained two terrible checks from Eudes, and Arnold, kings of France and Ger∣many, resolved to try their fortune once more in England, not with a view to make a settlement, but in hope of enriching themselves with plunder; for this purpose, they equipped three hundred vessels, which they divided into two fleets, and one of these, consisting of two hundred fail, bent its course towards Kent, where the adventurers landing, surprised Appledore. The other entered the river Thames, under the command of Hastings, who made himself master of Milton, and he and his colleague seemed to vye with each other in acts of rapine and barbarity. Alfred was at that time in East Anglia, settling the affairs of the kingdom upon the death of Guthrun: and he no sooner received intelligence of the invasion, than he exacted a new oath of allegiance from his East An∣glian subjects, Danes as well as English.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Having taken this precaution, he quitted that country, in order to march against the enemy; but his back was no sooner turned, than the East Anglian Danes declared in favour of their countrymen, and joined Hastings, in hope of sharing his good fortune. Alfred in the mean time assembled his troops, and advanced against that body of the invaders who ravaged the county of Kent; but, being informed in his march, that another swarm had lighted upon Wessex, he changed his route, in order to face those who had pe∣netrated into the heart of his own country. They had already invested Exeter, but being apprized of his approach, they raised the siege with precipitation, and retired to their ships. Their next attempt was upon Chichester, in which mis∣carrying, they failed to Beamflete, and joined Hastings, who being thus rein∣forced, ventured to make an incursion to the borders of Mercia, while Alfred was at a distance.</P>

<P>The English troops, taking the advantage of his absence, found means to beat up his quarters at Beamflete, where they found his wife and chil∣dren, who had been baptized; these being conveyed to Alfred, he sent them back to the Danish general, with a message importing that he did not make war upon women and christians.</P>

<P>Hastings, unwilling to wait for the king's return from the west, marched with great diligence as far as Shropshire, in his way to Wales, where he expected to be joined by the Britons.

<P>There they raised a fresh body of troops, and being reinforc∣ed by their countrymen of Northumberland, set out again for Wales, and marched with such expedition, that they arrived at Chester, where they fortified themselves, before the English forces could come up. As the season was too far advanced for the undertaking of the siege, they were allowed to winter in

<P>Towards the latter end of the year, they advanced to the borders of Mercia, and erected two forts at Hertford on the Ley, for the security of their ships which they had brought up that river. Here they were attacked by the Londoners, who were repulsed. But Alfred, approaching with his army, and viewing the nature of their situation, turned the course of the stream; so that their vessels were left on dry ground: a circumstance which terrified them to such a degree, that they abandoned their forts, and flying towards the Severne, were pursued by Alfred as far as Quatbridge, where they intrenched themselves for the present, until they found an opportunity of retiring into Northumber∣land, where their friends supplied them with ships, in which they imbarked for Normandy in a miserable plight, after having remained in England three years, during which they had undergone a series of misery and mischance, harrassed, hunted, and diminished one half in their number, by diseases, famine, and the sword. After their departure, Alfred found no difficulty in reducing the East<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Sax. An.

<P>Having once more re-established the peace of the country by the ex∣pulsion of those invaders, he resumed the character of the legislator, in order to fi∣nish the plan of government in the execution of which he had already made such confiderable progress. He divided the whole kingdom into counties, the counties into hundreds, and these last into tythings, so denominated because they consisted of ten freeholders, who were pledges to the king for the good behaviour of each other. He complied an excellent body of laws from the scripture, the in∣stitutions of other nations, and the collections or digesta of his predecessors Ethelbert, Ina, and Offa. He was author of that inestimable privilege peculiar to the subjects of this nation, which consists in their being tried by their peers; for he first instituted juries, or at least improved upon an old institution, by spe∣cifying the number and qualifications of the jurymen, and extending their power to trials of property as well as criminal indictments. He invented the expedient of giving bail and surety, in order to exempt individuals from unmerited impri∣sonment; he appointed public fairs and markets, to prevent the clandestine sale of stolen cattle; he abolished the civil jurisdiction of thanes or coldermen, who acted in the double capacity of generals and judges, in their respective shires, and substituted in their room shire-reeves, who acted as deputies to these counts or eoldermen. Justices were like likewise appointed; but the original extent of their power is not exactly known. And lastly, he ordained that original writs should be granted by the proper officer, without any special petition to the king; by which form, the plaintiff was provided with the immediate means of prosecu∣tion and redress.</P>

<P>But, no regulation of Alfred redounded more to his honour and the advantage of the kingdom, than the measures he took to prevent rapine, murder, and other outrages, which had so long been committed with impunity. Every tything-man was bound for the good behaviour of his own family, his neighbours, and guests; and obliged, in case of any breach of the peace, or other crime, to have the offender forthcoming, or if he fled, to purge himself of all suspicion of being an accomplice. Every one who did not enter himself in one <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 897</NOTE>
<PB N="148" REF="1570"/>
of these tythings, was held as an outlaw; and could not be received in any hun∣dred or borrough, without a certificate from the tything to which he belonged. One of the ten freeholders presided over the other nine, by the name of tything∣man, headborough, or borsholder; and summoned them occasionally to de∣termine small disputes in the neighbourhood.</P>

<P>Alfred, notwithstanding his great capacity, did not fail to consult the sages of his realm, upen every affair of importance. All his resolutions with respect to public affairs, passed through three different councils; the first of which was composed of the king's particular friends and favourites, in which every measure was prepared for the second coun∣cil, consisting of the bishops, counts, viscounts, judges, and some of the principal thanes, afterwards distinguished by the name of barons. The third, was the general assembly of the nation, called in the Saxon language Wittema∣gemat, the members of which owed their admission to their own quality or of∣fices, independent of the king's pleasure or appointment.</P>

<P>Occupied as he was in this great work of laying the foundation of the English constitution, his attention stooped even to the minutest circum∣stance of his people's conveniency. He introduced the art of brick-mak∣ing, and built his own houses of those materials, which being much more durable, sightly, and secure from accidents, than timber, his example was followed, first, by his nobles, and afterwards by the subjects in general, who vyed with each other in expressing their reverence and affection for this illustri∣ous monarch. He was, doubtless, an object of the most perfect esteem and ad∣miration; for exclusive of the qualities which distinguished him as a warrior and legislator, his personal character was amiable in every respect. He had made considerable progress in the different studies of grammar, rhetoric, philoso∣phy, architecture, andgeometry, was an excellent historian, and acknowledged to be the best Saxon poet of the age <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">He himself translated the Pastoral of Gre∣gory I; Boetius de consolatione; and Bede's ecclesiastical history. His fame was so exten∣sive, that the pope, in honour to his character, granted new privileges to the English college at Rome; and he was presented with a number of relicks, by that pontif, as well as by Abel pa∣tr arch of Jerusalem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And what rendered his erudition the more valuable and surprising, was the gross ignorance of the times, concerning which he himself complained, that from the Humber to the Thames, there was not one priest who perfectly understood the divine service; nor one to be found between the Thames and the sea, capable of translating the easiest latin book.</P>
<P>In a word, he adhered to the wisest maxims of government, calculated for the happiness of his people, of whom he was at the same time the father and the king: his public character acquired the veneration of all his neighbours; his private life betrayed no blemish or imperfection; and he was certainly one of the best and greatest monarchs that ever exercised the functions of sovereign power. What wonder then that the English nation should bitterly lament his death, which happened in the fifty-second year of his age <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">By his wife El<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>witha, he had several chil∣dren, some of which, and among these his eldest son Edmund, died before him.

<P>When his son Edward ascended the throne, England was inhabited by almost an equal number of Saxons and Danes. These last were in possession of Northumberland and East Anglia, from which the greatest part of the English families had been expelled. The Saxons occupied all Wessex, comprehending the country to the southward of the Thames, and the ancient kingdom of Essex; and Mercia was in a manner divided between the two nations. The Danes being no longer over-awed by the superior qualities of Alfred, and thinking themselves able to cope with the English power, resolved to seize the first opportunity of shaking off the Saxon yoke; and they were soon furnished with a plausible pretence. Ethelwald, the eldest son of Ethelbert whom Alfred succeeded, was persuaded to claim the crown by the right of primogeniture, though contrary to the will of Ethelwulph, which he pretended to set aside as illegal: but the English were so warmly attached to the family of Alfred, that he could find no Saxon of any consequence, who would espouse his cause; and therefore he had recourse to the Danes, by whom, in all probability, he had been at first excited.</P>

<P>Having assembled a small body of adherents, he surprised Win∣burn, a strong place in Dorsetshire, which, however he was not able to main∣tain: for, Edward marched against him with such expedition, that before he could provide for his defence, he was obliged to quit the town with great precipitation, and fly into Normandy, from whence he was conveyed to Northumberland, where the Danes acknowledged him as sovereign of England; and their example was followed by their countrymen of East-Anglia. As he could not be too di∣ligent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton. Flor. Wig∣horn. Chron.

<P>Notwithstanding this treaty, which was concluded at Ickford, in Bucks, the peace of the kingdom was incessantly disturbed by the Northumbri∣ans and Danes of Derby, Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln, and Stamford, who joined their forces, and ravaged the adjacent country. At length Edward, in∣censed at these bostilities, equipped a fleet, in order to infest their commerce and their coasts; and they supposing that the greatest part of his army was em∣barked, invaded his territories with a strong body of forces, in full confidence of pillaging with impunity. But in their return they were attacked at Teten∣hale, in Staffordshire, by the West-Saxons and Mercians, who defeated them in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>This calm was not of long continuance; for a body of Danish horse, from Northampton and Leicester, marching suddenly into Oxfordshire, surprized and defeated a body of Edward's forces at Hokenorton, and returned to their settlements loaded with booty. Another squadron, encouraged by their success, penetrated into Bedfordshire; but the country being by this time alarm∣ed, they were routed and cut in pieces. These were but the preludes to a more formidable invasion of Danish free-booters from the southern parts of Britany, commanded by Otar and Rohault, who entering the river Severne, plundered the Welsh and English indiscriminately, and took Cumeleac, bishop of Erchen∣field, prisoner, who was ransomed by Edward for forty pounds.</P>
<P>Hitherto they had only sent small detachments on shore to plunder the coun∣try; but at length they landed their whole force, and advanced towards Erchen∣field: but their progress was stopped by the militia of Herefordshire, Gloucester∣shire, and some neighbouring towns and counties, which assembling in arms, marched against the invaders, whom they routed with great slaughter, losing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>Edward having freed his country from those barbarians, march∣ed into Buckinghamshire, and raised a fort on each side of the Ouze, to over∣awe the Danes who were settled in that neighbourhood. This expedient had such a good effect, that Thurkytel, a Danish earl of great property in those parts, and all the principal noblemen, submitted to the English monarch; so that his right was recognized by all the Danes of Buckingham, Bedford, and Nor∣thampton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Having re peopled Bedford with English, and fortified Maldon, he granted free liberty to all the Danes to depart from the kingdom, if they did not choose to live under his administration; and Thurkytel, with all his adherents, took the advantage of this indulgence; a retreat which greatly strengthened the administration of Edward, who likewise owed great accession of power to the death of his sister. That celebrated heroine had left one daughter, called Elf∣winna, heiress to the whole county of Mercia, the property of which had been vested in her father by Alfred the great: and as this alienation from the crown was very prejudicial to her uncle Edward, she began to fear he would take the first opportunity of re-annexing it to his domains. In this apprehension she re∣solved to strengthen her possession by a match with Reginald, chief king of the Danes in England, and actually engaged in a secret treaty for that purpose: but her uncle being apprised of her intention so detrimental to his interest, took possession of the principal cities of Mercia, exacted an oath of allegiance from the inhabitants, and carried the young lady into his own dominions. Thus, he became master of that populous country, including the city of London, which though originally belonging to the kingdom of Essex, was now become the capital of Mercia. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>The Danes were not the only enemies that disturbed the repose of Ed∣ward.

They accordingly landed in that country, and meeting with no resistance, advanced as far as Chester, before Edward was in a condition to op∣pose their progress. At length, however, assembling his forces, he divided them into two separate bodies, with one of which he marched against the invaders, whom he overtook at Sherwood, where a desperate battle ensued. The leaders of both armies fought in person at the head of their troops; and Leofred, the Dane, charging the royal standard with incredible fury, the king was in great dan∣ger of being taken and slain; when his son Athelstan, springing forwards to his

Griffith had in another division been attacked, routed, and slain by Edward's generals: so that nothing was wanting to compleat the fortune of the day; though the king's glory was a little fullied by the death of the prisoner Leofred, whom he ordered to be beheaded in cold blood.</P>

They erected a fort at Thamesford, in Bedfordshire, from whence they made incursions into different parts of the country, which they ravaged with their usual barbarity. But their fortification in this place, as well as the town of Colchester, which they possessed, was taken by Edward, who ordered all whom he found in arms to be put to the sword. This severity, by which a Danish prince and two noblemen had lost their lives, exasperated the rest of that people to such a degree, that the insurrection became ge∣neral; and assembling a numerous army, they undertook the siege of Maldon, from which they were obliged to desist, after having sustained great damage from the salli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the garrison.

<P>He was succeeded in his throne by his eldest son Athelstan, a prince every way qualified for wielding the sceptre of a great empire: he had been
<PB N="153" REF="1620"/>
knighted by his grandfather<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton tells us, that Athelstan was the son of a concubine c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled Egwina, the daugh∣ter of a shepherd, who having in her infancy dreamed that the moon shone out of her belly so as to illuminate all England, was educated in a genteel manner at the expence of a matron who had given suck to Edward. The young maiden became remarkable for her beauty and other accomplishments; and one day, when the king visited his nurse, he chanced to cast his eyes upon Egwin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and was so captivated by her charms, that he would not leave the house until he had obtained her consent to gratify his passion. Athelstan wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the fruit of this amour, as well as a second son called Alfred, and a daughter named Editha. Though this story is credited by William of Maimesbury and others, it is more likely that Egwina, though of humble parentage, was really the wife of Edward; for∣asmuch as we find Alfred the great honouring Athelstan with the order of knighthood, as his own presumptive heir; which surely would not have been the case had he been a bastard. Be that as it will, Edward had two other wives, namely, Elfleda, daughter of earl Elshelm, by whom he had Ethelwald, who died immediate∣ly before his father, and Edwin; and Edgiva, by whom he had Edmund and Edred, who af∣terwards reigned, and two daughters, the eld∣est of whom was a nun, and the other married to Lewis, prince of Guienne.

<P>His election, however, gave umbrage to a few noblemen, who per∣haps had some scruples about his legitimacy; and they engaged in a conspiracy to remove him from the throne, in favour of his brother Edwin. Athelstan be∣ing apprized of their design, immediately apprehended the chief conspirator, whose name was Alfred; but, the proof being defective, he was sent to Rome to purge himself by oath, in presence of the pope: he accordingly took the oath at the altar, but was immediately seized with a violent fit, in which he expired; and this the pontif considered as a judgment of God for his perjury. He there∣fore, in his letter to Athelstan, concluded that the deceased was certainly guilty; and desired to know, whether or not he would allow him christian burial. Athelstan, very well pleased to find himself rid of such a dangerous subject, consented to his being interred with the usual ceremony, and in the mean time confiscated his estate, which he bestowed upon the monastery of Malmesbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

Wishing to attach this prince to his interest, that his reign might not be disturbed by the continual incursions of the Danes, like that of his father, he not only pardoned his revolt, but gave him his sister Editha in marriage, though he was then a man in years, and had two sons full grown by a former wife. Sithric survived his nuptials but a few months; and his eldest son Guthred, disdaining to hold a precarious sceptre de∣pendent upon the will of Athelstan, seized almost all the forts of the kingdom, and prohibited his subjects from paying the tribute to the English monarch.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="46" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>Athelstan, alarmed at this rebellion, assembled his troops, and en∣tered Northumberland so suddenly, that Guthred with his brother Anlaf, and Inguald, king of York, had scarcely time to secure their persons by a precipi∣tate flight; so that the English king made himself master of the whole country without opposition, except the castle of York, which he could not immediately reduce. He did not however enjoy his conquest in tranquillity, while he had reason to believe the three fugitive princes had any chance of returning to excite fresh troubles in Northumberland. The fate of Inguald is not known; but Anlaf escaped into Ireland, and Guthred fled for protection to Constan∣tine, king of Scotland. Athelstan immediately sent deputies to this prince, desiring he would deliver the person of Guthred into his hands; otherwise he would go in quest of him at the head of an army. Constantine, piqued at this insolent message, yet afraid of incurring the displeasure of such a war∣like monarch, agreed to meet Athelstan at Daker, for which place he accord∣ingly set out, accompanied by Owen, king of Cumberland; but, in the mean time, gave Guthred an opportunity to withdraw from his court.</P>
<P>Athelstan admitted the excuses of the Scottish king, though not a little con∣cerned at the escape of the Dane, who made an unsuccessful attempt upon the city of York, and then turned pyrate on the high seas, till at length being weary of such a boisterous and infamously precarious life, he surrendered himself to the English king, who allowed him a pension for his subsistence. This he enjoy∣ed for some time; but at last conceiving some disgust, he made his escape from the place of his residence, and was never heard of afterwards. Athelstan, at this conference with the two kings, is said to have exacted homage from the both; and notwithstanding all the allegations of the Scottish writers, who so vehement∣ly deny this act of submission, in all probability it was imposed upon Constantine, who seems to have retained an implacable resentment against the English mo∣narch from this period. Be that as it may, such homage, extorted from a weak prince, by fear and compulsion, can never affect the independency and freedom of the nation.</P>

<P>Constantine returned to his own country, very much chagrined at the behaviour of Athelstan; while Anlaf, informed of his discontent, repaired to his court from Ireland, and artfully inflamed his resentment and ambition, by inveighing against the insolence and dangerous power of the English king, and representing the practicability of conquering Northumberland, by means of the succours he should be able to bring from Ireland. The Scottish prince ea∣gerly embraced his proposal, for the execution of which they began to make pre∣parations without delay; and in the mean time, prevailed upon Howel king of Wales to make a diversion in their favour. Athelstan, who had returned to Wessex, broke their measures by his diligence and activity; for so soon as he
<PB N="155" REF="1640"/>
received intelligence of a commotion in Wales, he began his march for that country, and obtained a compleat victory over Howel, whom he punished for his revolt, by augmenting the tribute which he annually payed to England.</P>

<P>This war being happily terminated, he advanced into Scotland, in order to take vengeance upon Constantine, for having sent a body of aux∣iliaries to Howel. As Anlaf had not yet arrived with his reinforcement from Ireland, the Scottish king was in no condition to oppose the English army, which drove him from one end of the kingdom to the other; and at last compelled him to deprecate the wrath of Athelstan with great humility. He obtained his request from the English monarch, who at the same time restored all the places he had taken in that kingdom, hoping, by this act of generosity, to conciliate the affection of Constantine, and detach him from the interest of the Danes. But, all this indulgence seemed rather to inflame than mitigate the rancour of Con∣stantine, who became more and more impatient to revenge this mortification, which his pride sustained from the triumph of Athelstan's generosity: that prince was no sooner returned to his own dominions, than he renewed his deli∣berations with Anlaf; and these confederates exerted all their industry and power<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Mean while, Athelstan began to be disquieted by jealous thoughts, arising from the popularity of his brother Edwin, who was accused by a certain nobleman of having been concerned in the conspiracy of Alfred. This charge had the greater appearance of truth, as Alfred's rebellion had been raised on pre∣tence of setting Edwin upon the throne; and in all probability, Athelstan was not very sorry to find a pretext for destroying such a dangerous competitor in the affection of the public. Tho' the unhappy youth protested, with all the appear∣ance of truth and candour, that he was entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge, he was convicted on the testimony of this corrupted evidence; and Athel∣stan, being afraid of taking away his life by a public execution, ordered this unfor∣tunate young prince to be turned adrift with one servant, in a crazy vessel destitute of sails, oars, and provision. Edwin finding himself thus exposed to the dangers of the deep and horrors of famine, leaped overboard into the sea, in which all his misery was extinguished with his life, while his attendant resolved to depend upon providence, and saw himself with his boat cast ashore by the billows on the coast of France. This cruel sentence was no sooner executed than the king repented of what he had done: his jealous fears being now removed, he re∣viewed the character of Edwin in the light of an amiable brother, and detested the wretch on whose evidence that young prince had been exposed to the most terrible death. This perfidious nobleman one day stumbled in presenting the cup to Athelstan, but recovering a firm footing, by means of his other leg, "See (said he) how one brother assists another." This remark was construed into raillery or reproach by Athelstan, who forthwith ordered him to be put to death, as a sacrifice to the manes of Edwin; and endeavoured to expiate his own guilt by severe penance and benefactions to the church <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">He did seven years penance, and built the monasteries of Middleton and Michelness, in the county of Dorset, ordering continual masses to be said for his own pardon, and the repose of his brother's soul.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE></P>

<P>During these transactions at the English court, Constantine and An∣laf were busily employed in making preparatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for the execution of their pro∣ject; they formed a confederacy with the Irish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Welsh, and Northumbrian Danes, and conducted their motions with such secrecy that Anlaf had entered the Humber with a fleet of six hundred sail, and overspread the whole country, be∣fore Athelstan received the least intimation of his design. But, the fortress garrisoned with English troops, retarded the progress of the confederates, un∣til he could assemble his army, at the head of which he marched against them with incredible dispatch. They had directed their route to the northward, in order to conquer Bernicia for the Scottish king; but understanding that Athelstan was on his march to attack them; they resolved to spare him part of the trouble, by meeting him on the way, and the two armies came in sight of each other at a place called Bruneford. A battle, however, did not immediately ensue, be∣cause both armies were so formidable and so advantageously posted, that neither chose to hazard an attack, until the inattention or misconduct of either side should afford an opportunity. During this pause Anlaf is said to have entered the English camp as a musician, and played so ravishingly as to attract the notice of Athelstan, who ordered him to perform in the royal tent, and rewarded him with a liberal present. In his retreat he was known by a common soldier, who allowed him to pass, and then informed the king of the discovery he had made. Athelstan chid him for allowing him to retire, but applauded the man's fidelity, when he told him he had once taken the oath of allegiance to that prince, and therefore would never be concerned in any particular attempt against his person. The king shifted his quarters that very day, and the same spot of ground was occupied by a bishop newly come to the camp, who lost his life in consequence of choosing that situation; for, in the middle of the night, Anlaf at the head of a chosen band, attacked the English encampment, and penetrating to this place, slew the prelate and all his attendants, on the supposition that the king still resided in that quarter. Athelstan, whose tent was removed at the distance of a mile from this scene of blood, taking the alarm, drew up his forces in order of bat∣tle, and at day-break the two armies were fairly engaged. They fought all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> day with equal bravery on both sides; 'till at length the chancellor Turketul, at the head of a select band of Londoners, bore down all before him, and unhorsed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

six kings of Ireland and Wales, and twice that number of counts and gene∣rals, lost their lives in this engagement; so that Athelstan, after this victory, met with no opposition in reducing the Scots, the Danes of Northumberland, and the Welsh, whose tribute was again augmented. After he had settled the affairs<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

He employed learned men to finish a transla∣tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 941:</NOTE> of the Bible into the Saxon language; and notwithstanding his piety and beneficence to the church, it appears from some fragments of his laws still ex∣tant, that his intention was to reduce the clergy, as well as the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of his subjects under his dominion, by abolishing those exemptions and sanctuaries which served only to encrease their insolence, and enable them to protect the worst of criminals. That he was highly respected by foreign powers, appears from the great matches he procured for his sisters, one of whom, the widow of Charles the Simple, found a happy retreat in his dominions with her son, who was afterwards distinguished by the name of Outre Mer or Ultra Marine, from his having been educated at the English court.</P>
<P>Athelstan, after the reduction of the Scots, Danes, and Britons, and the re∣treat of Anlaf, who returned to Ireland, enjoyed some years of respite from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 94<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ann.

<HEAD>§ LIII.</HEAD>
<P>Although the Danes were subdued, they were not yet reconciled to the English yoke, from which they resolved to free themselves with the first con∣venient opportunity. They considered the accession of young Edmund as a favourable conjuncture, and Anlaf did not fail to improve this disposition, with a view to acquire the crown of Northumberland: but, conscious of the impor∣tance of such an enterprize to be undertaken against the whole power of Eng∣land, he had recourse to the assistance of Olaus, king of Norway, who sup∣plied him with ships and men, with which he invaded Northumberland, and was admitted into York, by means of a correspondence which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had carried on with the principal inhabitants. The example of the capital was followed by a great many other places; the English garrisons were expelled or massacred, and the whole country received him as its sovereign. Not contented with the possession of Northumberland, he advanced into Mercia, where his reception was alike favourable, and his countrymen in that kingdom assisted him in re-takingsome places which had been wrested from them by Edward.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="54" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LIV.</HEAD>
<P>Edmund, though scarce turned of eighteen, far from being dispirit∣ed by the rapidity of Anlaf's progress, assembled his troops, and advanced against
<PB N="158" REF="1670"/>
the enemy, whom he found at West-chester, where an obstinate battle was fought with equal fury on both sides, until night parted the combatants; and the archbishops of Canterbury and York interposing their good offices, an ac∣commodation was effected, on condition that Anlaf should possess all the coun∣try lying to the north of Watling-street, which divides England from North-Wales, to the southern extremity of Kent. From this cession one would be apt to imagine that Edmund had been worsted in the battle; and that he con∣sented to this treaty with no other view than that of gaining time, until he should be in a condition to make himself amends, for the damage he had sus∣tained. <NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ng.</NOTE></P>
<P>Anlaf was no sooner established in peaceable possession of Northumberland, than he laid severe taxes upon his subjects, in order to discharge the debts which he had contracted with the king of Norway, by whose assistance he had acquired the crown; and by these impositions he lost the affection of his subjects. The inhabitants of Deira revolting, set up Reginald, the son of his brother Guthred, who being crowned in York, began to make preparations of war against his uncle; so that the kingdom was immediately divided into two factions, breathing against each other defiance and destruction.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="55" TYPE="section">

<P>Edmund, looking upon this as a favourable opportunity for retrieving the dominions he had ceded, began his march towards the north, and arrived upon the frontiers of Northumberland before the two kings had the least inti∣mation of his approach. Thus surprised, before they were in a posture of de∣fence, they were obliged to abandon the island, and Edmund made himself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Sax. M.

The homage which the Scottish kings in the sequel payed to the English monarch for these territories, was in all probability the foundation of the English claim to the sovereignty of all Scotland; though, by the same way of reasoning, the kings of England were afterwards vassals of France, be∣cause they did homage to the French king for the dutchy of Normandy.</P>

<P>Edmund's attention was not intirely engrossed by the operations of war. He likewise employed his study to improve the civil policy of his king∣dom; and the laws which he enacted evidently prove how much he had the hap∣piness of his subjects at heart. Observing that pecuniary mulcts were very insuf∣ficient penalties for restraining thieves and robbers, who have generally very little to lose, he ordained that the eldest member of the gang should be hanged upon conviction; for, theft had never before been punished with death in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> England. The kingdom would in all probability have flourished in every branch of culture under a prince of such excellent talents, had not he been cut off in the flower of his age by a very unfortunate and extraordinary accident. While he sat at table with his nobles, celebrating the feast of Augustine, at Pukelkirk in Gloucestershire, he espied among the croud a notorious felon called Leof,
<PB N="159" REF="1680"/>
whom he had banished for theft and rapine: he immediately commanded his sew∣er to seize the presumptuous thief, who had thus intruded himself even into the royal presence; but perceiving that this officer was not able to manage the de∣linquent, he himself started from table, and pulled him to the ground by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 946.</NOTE> hair of the head. Leof, knowing that an ignominious death awaited him, drew forth a dagger which was concealed under his cloaths; and while the king lay upon him, sheathed it in the bosom of his prince, who immediately expired. The death of the murderer, whom the noblemen immediately hewed in pieces, was but a poor atonement for the loss of such a valuable king thus cut off in the flower of his youth, after he had reigned about six years, during which he had given such specimens of his extraordinary courage, ability, and regard for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE two sons of Edmund by his wife Elgiva, being infants, his brother Edred ascended the throne with the unanimous suffrages of the nobi∣lity and clergy; and immediately after his elevation he marched into Northum∣berland to quell the commotions which his brother's death had excited among the Danes of that province, who were still watching an opportunity of with∣drawing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.</NOTE> themselves from the English government. As they found Edred in their country before they had taken any effectual measures to maintain their in∣dependency, they were obliged to submit to the terms which he was pleased to propose; and their example was followed by Malcolm king of Scotland, whom
<PB N="161" REF="1700"/>
they had engaged to assist them in their revolt. He had no sooner returned to his own dominions after this expedition, than the Danes, ever impatient of the Saxon yoke, resolved to make another attempt to retrieve their liberty; and re∣called Anlaf from Ireland with such secrecy and diligence, that this prince had reduced the most considerable places in Northumberland, before Edred could assemble his troops to oppose his progress. Indeed Anlaf made such good use of his time, that he was too firmly established on the throne of Northumberland, to be attacked with any prospect of success, and therefore Edred left him for the present in quiet possession of his conquest. But, his own tyrannical disposition produced such discontent among his subjects, and excited such a powerful faction against him, that he was fain to relinquish his throne, which they filled<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 952.</NOTE> with a nobleman called Eric. Nevertheless one party still continuing attached to the exiled Anlaf, the kingdom, as usual, was divided into desperate factions, and Edred took this opportunity to reduce it under his power: with this view he marched into Northumberland, which he found in anarchy and confusion; and at his approach Eric fled for refuge into Scotland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>The Danes finding themselves thus deserted by their prince, and desti∣tute of all means of opposition, implored the clemency of Edred with the most abject submission and solemn vows of future fidelity. These he credited, and even restored their king Eric to the throne, on certain restrictions; and having as he thought appeased the troubles of Northumberland to the intire satisfaction of the people, he set out from York on his return to Wessex, marching without much circumspection, among a people whom his generosity had laid under such obligations. But, the ungrateful Danes perceiving the negligence and disorder in which the English proceeded, assembled and armed themselves in private; then fell upon Edred's rear so suddenly, that nothing but his own personal valour and conduct could have saved his whole army from being cut in pieces. In∣censed at such a flagrant proof of their perfidy and ingratitude, he marched back into the heart of their country, which he resolved to destroy with fire and sword, and their ruin would have been inevitable, had they attempted to act in their own defence. But, in this extremity, they once more humbled themselves before the conqueror, laying the blame of what had happened upon Eric, whom they put to death as a victim offered to the indignation of Edred, who being appeased by these submissions and apologies, reinforced with a round sum of money, for∣gave<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>These tumults were succeeded by a profound calm, during which Edred's superstition took the lead of his other passions, and manifested itself in an impli∣cit obedience which he payed to Dunstan abbot of Glaston, who not only acted as his ghostly director, and in that quality gave him corporeal discipline with his own hand, but also acquired such influence over him in temporal affairs, that nothing either in church or state was executed without his advice and concurrence. It was by his counsel that almost all the benefices of the kingdom were bestowed upon monks, and the secular clergy totally neglected and set aside. Though this partiality raised up a number of enemies against him, which was not diminish∣ed by the pride and insolence of his behaviour, it secured the whole body of monks in his interest, and that indefatigable race took all opportunities of sound∣ing
<PB N="162" REF="1710"/>
his praise, and representing him as a prophet and apostle. These encomi∣u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s repeated on all occasions made an impression on the minds of the ignorant vulgar, and he was in a fair way of acquiring an absolute authority both in church and state, when he was checked in the middle of his career by the death<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nelm.</NOTE> of the king, who died of a quincy in the tenth year of his reign. Feeling his end approaching, he sent for Dunstan, who happened to be absent, in order to settle his spiritual affairs, as well as some temporal concerns unknown to every body but the abbot, who conscious of having in his hands certain large sums, for which he had not yet accounted, protracted the time on various pretences, un∣til the king had expired, and then appropriated the money to his own use: an acquisition which enabled him to live with great splendour and magnificence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Thus died Edred, who degenerated from the virtues of his predecessors in no∣thing but his blind attachment to this insolent and rapacious abbot. He was the first of all the Saxon monarchs, who assumed the title of king of Great Britain; a circumstance that favours the opinions of those who affirm that the king of Scotland held his crown as a fief depending upon England. Though he had two sons called Bertfred and Elfred, who were of age at his death, he was succeeded by his nephew Edwy, son of Edmund, who was elected monarch by the suffrages of the nobility and clergy. This elective power was in all pro∣bability a privilege which they retained when they first submitted to monarchical government; and a very wise precaution to prevent the mischiefs that attend the administration of an infant king.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Edwy, who ascended the throne at the age of fourteen, was a prince of great personal beauty, and a very amiable disposition; but, he looked upon Dunstan in a very different light from that in which he had been considered by his predecessor. On the very day of his coronation, he conceived a disgust at that officious abbot, for an affront, which a young prince could not easily forgive. Edwy having withdrawn from the tiresome ceremony of the day, to enjoy the conversation of a young lady called Athelgiva, of whose beauty and rare accomplishments he was deeply enamoured; Dunstan no sooner perceived his absence, than he rushed furiously into the apartment to which he had retired, and dragged him forth in the most outrageous manner, after having rebuked him for his effeminancy with all the bitterness of ecclesiastical rancour. Such an unmannerly and unseasonable insult could not fail to inspire the young monarch with resentment; and the nobles, who were scandalized at the overbearing pride and profusion of the abbot, improved this disposition by inveighing against his avarice and presumption, and insinuating that he had embezzled the treasure belonging to the late king, which he now squan∣dered away in purchasing a dangerous popularity. In consequence of these re∣monstrances, the king demanded restitution of the sums which Edred had com∣mitted to his charge; and Dunstan replied they had been expended in pious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, according to the king's direction. As the council did not think proper to urge him farther in this affair, they resolved to reverse and annul every step he had taken in favour of the monks, and immediately deprived them of all the be∣nefices they possessed, filling their places with the secular clergy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>This step not only mortified Dunstan exceedingly, as it lessened his credit among the people; but excited such a clamour among the monks, as might have been expected during the most severe persecution that ever raged against the christian religion. Among those that exclaimed the loudest against
<PB N="163" REF="1720"/>
this innovation, were the friars of Malmesbury; and in consequence of the noise they made, the king expelled them from the monastery, which was filled with secular priests. Dunstan, conscious to himself of having produced this dis∣turbance, quitted the kingdom, and retired to a monastery in Flanders, to wait for some favourable change, that might enable him to return with safety. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Huntingdo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The exile of this reputed saint, added to the sufferings of the monks, were hollowed in the ears of the people, as such flagrant instances of the king's impiety, that all the ecclesiastical part of the kingdom espoused the cause of their apostle and his brethren; and Odo, archbishop of Canterbury, was so far transported with the spirit of fanaticism, that he pronounced a formal divorce between Edwy and Athelgiva, that he might wound the king in the most ten∣der part. Ecclesiastical censures were of such consequence in those days, that the king could no longer, with any regard to his own safety, maintain his amorous correspondence, but was obliged to surrender his mistress to the pe∣nance of the church; and that unrelenting prelate ordered her to be branded in the face, and then exiled to Ireland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Not contented with having taken such unmanly vengeance, this tur∣bulent bishop, and the other adherents of Dunstan and his monks, first created malecontents by the most scandalous calumnies invented against Edwy, and then instigated them to open rebellion, under the pretence of dethroning such an un∣worthy king, and transferring the crown to his brother Edgar, who being an ambitious prince, of very insinuating qualifications, willingly lent his name, in∣terest, and personal activity, towards the success of this enterprize. Having put himself at the head of the rebels, and secured the greatest part of Mercia in his interest, he repaired to Northumberland and East-Anglia, where he found<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 957.</NOTE> the Danes very well disposed to concur in any scheme for involving the English in civil troubles and confusion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Thus strengthened, his faction became so powerful, that in a little time Edwy found himself abandoned by all his subjects, except the West-Saxons, and being unable to quell the rebellion, he retired for shelter to the city of Gloucester; while the states of Mercia assembling, deprived him in a formal manner of the sovereign power, and elected Edgar king of that realm, com∣prehending all the country to the northward of the Thames, except the antient kingdom of Essex. As the monks had been principally concerned in this elec∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Sim. Dun. An. Ch. 959.</NOTE> they did not fail to give it the sanction of a miracle, which consisted in a voice from heaven, commanding the assembled nobles to bestow the crown up∣on Edgar. After the ceremony of his coronation, a treaty was set on foot with his brother Edwy, who yielding to the torrent of misfortune, consented to a partition, which deprived him of the best part of his dominions; but the mor∣tification of seeing himself thus stripped of his territories, and the monks tri∣umphing in his disgrace, threw him into a deep melancholy, which conducted him to the grave, after he had survived or rather lingered out a painful existence, two years beyond the aera of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Edgar had no sooner mounted the throne of Mercia, than Dunstan returned to England, and recovered, at the court of this prince, all the influence he had possessed in the preceding reign. He was immediately promoted to the see of Worcester, and his supposed sanctity shining out with double splendor, after
<PB N="164" REF="1730"/>
the eclipse he had undergone, the king affected to be entirely guided by his directions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>Edwy dying without issue, the whole kingdom was re-united under Edgar, who, though in the prime of his youth, had already given undeniable proofs of a shining genius, and the most solid understanding. He had manifest∣ed his ability in making himself master of his brother's dominions, and he af∣terwards demonstrated the extensiveness of his capacity, by keeping his subjects in submission and his enemies in fear, without straining the regal authority, or engaging in any martial enterprise. But, he awed his neighbours by taking such measures for the defence of his kingdom, as disabled them from invading it with any prospect of success. He divided Northumberland into two govern∣ments, and constantly maintained a strong body of forces in the northern pro∣vinces, that they might be at hand to quell any insurrection that should happen among that turbulent people: and, in order to secure his dominions from the descents of foreign Danes, he equipped a very strong fleet, amounting to three thousand five hundred vessels, divided into different squadrons, and stationed in such a manner that they were continually cruising round the island, which was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Wigorn. G. Malmes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Mat. Westm.</NOTE> thus effectually covered from insult. Such wife precautions could not fail to establish peace and tranquility among his people, which in order to fix beyond any possibility of interruption, he engaged Kenneth, king of Scotland, in his in∣terest, by ceding to him the whole country of Lothian, extending from the Tweed to the Forth; for which, and the northern counties already bestowed upon Malcolm, that prince certainly did homage. It was in all probability owing to this cession and treaty, which secured the Scottish king as an ally, that Maccuse, king of Man and the isles, some toparchs of Galloway, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 959.</NOTE> princes of Wales, submitted so peaceably to the government of Edgar. These were the princes who visited the court at Chester, and rowed his barge down the river Dee, while he himself sat at the helm; a circumstance which some his∣torians have considered as an act of homage, whereas it appears to have been no more than a compliment or frolic, acted in an excursion of pleasure, that could admit of no serious consideration or consequence.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding all his vigilance and care, in maintaining the peace of his subjects, it was still interrupted by two domestic evils, namely, an infi∣nite number of wolves that came down from the mountains of Wales <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stroy∣ing the sheep and alarming the neighbourhood; and corrupted civil magistrates, who oppressed the people by a partial distribution of justice. In order to free the country from the first of these plagues, Edgar changed the tribute of the Welch into three hundred wolves heads, to be yearly payed in lieu of money and cattle; and published a general amnesty for all crimes committed before a certain term, provided the criminals would produce an appointed number of wolves tongues, according to the nature of the crimes they had committed: an expedient so effectual, that in three years the species of that animal was ut∣terly destroyed in England. With respect to the magistracy, as it was a mat∣ter of far greater importance, he enacted a law, by which every magistrate con∣victed of having pronounced an unjust decision, was mulcted in a sum of money, if it proceeded from ignorance; but if a wilful abuse, he was rendered incapa∣ble of holding that or any other office in the kingdom. And the king himself
<PB N="165" REF="1740"/>
made a yearly circuit through the different parts of his dominions to redress the injured, and take cognizance of the guilty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The great qualities of Edgar were certainly very commendable; but in all probability his praises would not have been so loudly sounded, had not the monks found in him a zealous patron, and munificent benefactor. He is said to have founded forty monasteries, and to have repaired and embellished a much greater number, which he endowed, not with liberality, but profusion, alienating the crown lands for the support of those idle and pernicious drones.</P>
<P>All these benefactions were suggested by Dunstan, who not only enjoyed the see of Worcester, but was also made administrator of the vacant bishopric of Lon∣don. He had, by this time, acquired such reputation among the people for his sanctity and miracles, which the monks did not fail to attest and exaggerate, and gained such an ascendancy over the mind of Edgar, that he reigned absolute master in military, civil, and ecclesiastical affairs. Brethelm, bishop of Bath, a very worthy and pious prelate, but no favourer of the monks, being elected to the see of Canterbury, at the death of archbishop Elfin, the king re∣solved to procure that dignity for his favourite, and assembled a general coun∣cil, in which he harangued against the inability of Brethelm, and recommend∣ed Dunstan so warmly, that the former was sent back to his original diocese, and the other elevated to the archbishopric of Canterbury. As this election was not altogether canonical, it was found necessary to demand the pope's confirma∣tion, and Dunstan immediately set out for Rome, on pretence of receiving the pall. The pope, who was well informed of his great credit at court, and his zeal for the interest of the Roman church, not only confirmed his election, but also created him his legate in England, with a very extensive authority. He then returned in triumph, and promoted his relation Oswald to the see of Wor∣cester, and hat of Winchester was given to Ethelwold, his intimate friend: so that this triumvirate acting in concert, governed the king and the whole church of England. Dunstan being now too firmly rooted in his power to dread the efforts of his enemies, resolved to execute the grand project he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim. Dun. Ingulph.</NOTE> formed in favour of the monks.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>These industrious emissaries let slip no opportunity of inveighing against the luxury and libertinism of the secular clergy, who certainly did not lead the most regular lives; and the minds of the people being thus prepared, the king asse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bled a council, and in a studied oration declaimed against the ir∣regularities of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> priests, their riots, their amours, and debauchery; then addressing himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dunstan and his confederates, conjured them to take some effectual methods for reforming such enormous abuses. As this speech was evi∣dently levelled against the secular clergy, the friends of that body would not ven∣ture to oppose the king's inclination, and the triumvirate of bishops took the first opportunity of expelling the seculars from all the churches and convents under their jurisdiction and influence.

His brother Edwy had been reviled and even excommunicated as an impious wretch, for carrying on a simple intrigue with the fair Athelgiva, whom some historians suppose to have been his wife, though the marriage was within the degrees of consanguinity prohibited by the canon law. We have al∣ready seen how that poor lady was branded by the fanatic Odo, and trans∣ported to Ireland, though he had no legal power to inflict corporal punishment on the meanest subject. On her return she was ham-strung by the same au∣dac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous prelate, while her unhappy lover, unable to protect her from such bar∣barity, or even to revenge her wrongs, was publicly calumniated as a tyrant and an adulterer, and even deprived of the best part of his dominions by the arts and instigations of those ecclesiastical traitors. But Edgar, whose passions were more irregular, indulged them with impunity, even to unpardonable ex∣cess: he committed a rape upon a nun, by whom he had a daughter named Editha, who afterwards distinguished herself for her great piety, in conse∣quence of which she was canonized. For this sacrilege, which in Edwy would have been unpardonable, all the penance which Dunstan inflicted, was a slight censure, which delayed the coronation of Edgar, who nevertheless enjoyed his pleasure without controul, deflowering the daughters of his subjects, and snatch∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>His first wife was Elfleda, surnamed the Fair, daughter of a noble∣man called Ordmer, by whom he had Edward his immediate successor; and he afterwards married Elfrida, the beauteous heiress of Devonshire, whose story is too remarkable to be passed over in silence. This young lady had been edu∣cated at home, under the inspection of her father Ordung count of Devon, who had no other child; but, notwithstanding her retired life, the fame of her beauty and accomplishments reached the ears of Edgar, who employed his favourite Ethelwald to visit the father on some pretext, which would afford an opportu∣nity of seeing the daughter, that he might certainly know whether or not her beauty really justified the report he had heard. Ethelwald no sooner saw the fair Elfrida than his own heart was captivated; and, in order to detach the king intirely from this subject, he described her in such a manner as divested Edgar of all curiosity to be further acquainted with her person. Having weaned the king's thoughts from Elfrida, he took occasion to represent to his majesty the advantages he himself should reap from such a profitable match, and having obtained permis∣sion to demand her in marriage from the father, succeeded in his suit. Soon after he had thus accomplished his aim, some courtier, who owed him a grudge, ex∣plained the whole mystery to Edgar, who, though extremely incensed at the trea∣chery of Ethelwald, dissembled his resentment, until he should have an opportu∣nity of investigating the truth by the evidence of his own senses. He accord∣ingly found some pretence for hunting or travelling near Ethelwald's house, and declared his intention of visiting the lady who had been the subject of so much conversation. He was then fully convinced of Ethelwald's prefidious dealing; yet he still disguised his indignation, and in a little time the favou∣rite was found murdered in a wood. The suspicion fell immediately on the king, because he took no steps to discover the perpetrators of the murder, but, as soon as decency would permit, married the widow, by whom he had Edmund, who died in his infancy, and Ethelred, who lived to reign in the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> order of succession.</P>

<P>The term of his penance being expired, he was solemnly anointed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He extended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> his liberality to men of learning and genius; his court was hospitable and mag∣nificent, and generally filled with a concourse of foreigners, who were charmed with his elegance and politeness: and from the tranquillity of his reign, he ac∣quired the denomination of Edgar the Pacific <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tho' he was small in stature, and of a slender m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, he possessed an uncommon share of per∣sonal strength and agility, and was very dexte∣rous at all the exercises of the times. Nor was his pacific reign owing to any defect in point of courage, as he demonstrated on different oc∣casions. Kenneth, king of Scotland, while he resided at his court, is said to have ridiculed the diminutive stature of Edgar, one night while he was intoxicated with liquor. His unman∣nerly jest being reported to the king, he made some pretence to walk along with Kenneth in∣to an unfrequented place, where giving him to understand that he was informed of the con∣tempt he had expressed for his person, he de∣sired him to draw his sword, and he would con∣vince him of his mistake, if he thought courage depended upon the muscles of the body. Ken∣neth, struck with this instance of magnanimity, begged pardon for the rudeness of his behaviour, which he imputed to his intoxication: and Ed∣gar admitted of his apology. The Scottish his∣torians deny the truth of this circumstance, as if they thought it derogated from the courage of Kenneth; though it rather redounds to the ho∣nour of his memory, as it proves he had sense and candour to make reparation for the offence he had given.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Immediately after the decease of Edgar, Elfser duke of Mercia, sworn enemy to the monks, expelled them from all the benefices in his country, which he filled again with secular priests; some other noblemen followed his example in different parts of the kingdom, but the duke of East Anglia and many other persons of the first rank adhered to Dunstan and his party, which was like∣wise espoused by almost the whole body of the commons, who looked upon that prelate as a saint and apostle. This diversity of sentiments produced a con∣test concerning the succession; for, Elfrida the queen dowager, a woman of an ambitious spirit, had by her emissaries circulated some doubts about the validity of Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, in hope of raising her own son Ethelred to the throne; and as the other was supported by Dunstan, all that prelate's enemies declared for the son of Elfrida. Tho' by these means, there was a very powerful faction formed in his favour, the archbishop, confiding in his great popularity, arose from the assembly of the states while they were delibe∣rating upon the choice of a successor to Edgar, and taking prince Edward by the hand, conducted him to the church, where he was anointed and consecrated
<PB N="168" REF="1770"/>
in the twelfth year of his age, amidst a vast concourse of people, who testified their joy in loud acclamations. Whatever inclination the opposite party felt to controvert this irregular way of proceeding, they would not run the risque of dis∣obliging the multitude, but left Edward in quiet possession of the crown, while his mother in-law Elfrida retired to Corf castle in Dorsetshire, which was as∣signed as her dower, and there in secret hatched schemes for his destruction.</P>

<P>Dunstan, having thus secured the continuance of his own power and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> interest, exerted all his endeavours to maintain the monks in the benefices which they had acquired in the preceding reign, and even employed the king's authority in their behalf. But, as little regard was paid to the declaration of a minor prince, intirely under his direction and influence, he had recourse to miracles, which more effectually answered his purpose. His proposals in council were seconded by a speaking crucifix, and a vision of St. Andrew; and at a mixed assembly composed of the laity and clergy, who had met at Calne in Wiltshire, the debates running high against the monks, the whole roof of the house fell down, and crushed a number of people to death, while the beam under which St. Dunstan's chair was placed, continued firm and immoveable, and defended the holy bishop, who sustained no damage, though every other person in the assembly was either killed or wounded.

<P>Besides these ecclesiastical affairs, no transaction of consequence dis∣tinguished the reign of Edward, which lasted but four years, and was con∣cluded in a very tragical manner. The king returning one day from the chace in Dorsetshire, rode up singly to the gate of Corf castle, to pay a compliment to his mother-in-law Elfrida, who invited him very courteously to alight; and finding him in a hurry to begone, insisted upon his drinking a cup of wine as he sat on horseback; the young prince complied with her request, and as he swallowed the liquor, was stabbed in the back by one of her domestics tutored for the purpose. Edward, finding himself wounded, clapped spurs to his horse, but he fainted with loss of blood, and his foot being entangled in the stirrup, as he fell, was dragged a considerable way, when the horse made a stop of his own accord before the door of a poor old blind woman; there the servants of Elfrida, sent by their mistress to know the issue of her treason, found the unhappy prince quite dead, and terribly defaced by the flints over which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

They threw the body into a well, where in a few days it was found, and interred at Wareham, from whence it was afterwards transported to the monastery of Shaftesbury, where it is said to have performed a great many miracles; and Edward was canonized as a saint and martyr. As for Elfrida, she was seized with horror and remorse for the inhuman crime she had com∣mitted; in order to attone for which, she founded two monasteries at Ambres∣bury in Wiltshire, and Worwell in Northamptonshire; in the last of which she<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. l. i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> endeavoured to expiate her guilt by a life of penance and mortification.</P>

<P>Edward being thus basely murdered, Dunstan is said to have offered his interest to Edgitha, the natural daughter of Edgar, who was, by this time, ab∣bess of the convent at Wilton; but, she was too conscious of the defect in her
<PB N="169" REF="1780"/>
own title, and too much terrified at the deplorable fate of her brother Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 979.</NOTE> to accept his offer; he therefore, having no other pretence to reject the preten∣sions of Ethelred, crowned and consecrated that prince at Kingston, in the twelfth year of his age. But, this ceremony he performed with such malevo∣lence as plainly evinced the rancour of his heart; for, in the very act of placing the crown upon this young prince's head, he prophecied that his reign should be cursed with the misery and slaughter of his subjects, because he had succeed∣ed to the crown in consequence of his mother's guilt, to which this inocent youth was so far from being accessary, that he bewailed his brother's death with all the bitterness of sorrow, and thereby incurred his mother's displeasure and ha∣tred. Had Ethelred inherited the spirit of his father, Dunstan's prophecy would in all probability have been falsified: but, he was a prince of very mean parts, though very amiable in his person; his education had been neglected be∣fore his accession to the throne, and now that he found himself vested with the regal power, without knowledge or resolution, he was involved in a labyrinth of perplexity, which was increased by his natural timidity, indolence and distrust. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor.

<P>Such being the disposition and inexperience of the prince, nowon∣der that the reins of government were relaxed, and all the necessary precautions for the security of the kingdom, entirely neglected. The principal nobility who had been intrusted with the government of different counties, perpetuated the administration in their families, assumed the name of dukes, exercised an inde∣pendent authority in their own districts, and disregarded that union upon which alone the safety and welfare of the nation could depend. The regulations of the militia were no longer observed: the English gave themselves up to effemi∣nate pleasures, and hired mercenaries to do the drudgery of war; and these hirelings were generally Danes, who had no interest but that of plundering the people whom they were employed to protect. Thus the Saxons exposed them∣selves, with the utmost temerity, to the designs of their most inveterate ene∣my; and the government, as if it had conspired against the nation, suffered its chief bulwark the navy to decay and perish, for want of maintenance and repair. The Danes, who were settled in England, still retained their old desire of free∣ing themselves from the English yoke, and, in all probability, encouraged their countrymen to make a descent at this favourable juncture, when the government was weak, and the kingdom defenceless.</P>

<P>Accordingly, a body of those pyrates arrived in seven vessels, and having<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Their motions were so sudden, from one part of the coast to the other, that it was altogether impracticable to secure the country from their depredations, and there was such a languor in the administration, that they were not opposed with that vigour and alacrity which they dreaded in the former reigns. In a word, the country was exposed to the most cruel calamities of war for a series of years, during which the people were robbed, ruined, and murdered with impu∣nity; for, whenever the enemy were worsted, they retired to their ships, and all the advantage which the English derived from their victory, was the recovery of their own effects, and a very small respite, until the army retreated, or the

<P>As Ethelred paid very little regard to the monks, and had more than once made their leader Dunstan feel the weight of his regal power, they second∣ed the efforts of the Danes, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omenting the spirit of discontent and disaffec∣tion, and exciting civil dissensions, which disabled the administration from tak∣ing effectual measures to repulse the enemy, who were moreover encouraged and joined by numbers of their own countrymen settled in England. The people at length began to be undeceived with regard to the sanctity of Dunstan, and even to discredit his pretended power of working miracles, because he nei∣ther could maintain his own interest in the state, nor avert those calamities which afflicted the nation. They saw with indifference the contempt which Ethelred manifested for the archbishop, especially in a quarrel with the bishop of Rochester, whose cause Dunstan espoused with such violence of zeal, that the king compelled him to purchase his forbearance with one hundred pounds of gold; an exaction for which he denounced a bitter curse against his ma∣jesty, and conceived such chagrin and mortification, as in all probability short∣ened the period of his days. He and his two colleagues, the bishops of York<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<P>After the Danes had for ten years successively pillaged the coasts of England, they discontinued their ravages, and the people enjoyed a respite of two years; so that they began to hope the enemy had turned their arms against some other quarter of Europe. But, these hopes were fatally frustrated; for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghorn. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ron. Sax.</NOTE> when they least expected such a visitation, Justin and Guthmund, two Danish generals, landed with a strong body of forces at Sheppeswick, in Essex; and while they were employed in pillaging, Brithnot, duke of East-Anglia, advanc∣ed with his troops, in order to surprize them: but they gave him such a warm reception, that he was defeated; and meeting with no further opposition, they advanced into the heart of the country, in which they committed the most<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 991.</NOTE> horrible excesses. In this extremity Ethelred allowed himself to be persuaded by Siric, archbishop of Canterbury, to buy a peace with a sum of money; and the expedient succeeded so far, that the Danish generals retired; but, at the same time, it encouraged other adventurers of that nation to try the like experiment. Accordingly a fleet of those free-booters appeared in the course of the ensuing year upon the coast of East-Anglia; but, on this occasion, Ethelred took a more wise and manly method of treating the enemy: he assem∣bled a great number of ships from all parts of the kingdom, at London, where he ordered them to be well manned and supplied with munition of war: then bestowing the command of this armament upon Alfric, duke of Mercia, directed him to block up the Danish navy in the harbour in which it lay at anchor: but, the scheme was defeated by the treachery of Alfric, who deserted to the Danes, and gave them notice of the danger; so that they put to sea imme∣diately, and escaped. The king was so much incensed at the traitor, that he
<PB N="171" REF="1800"/>
commanded the eyes of his children to be put out; yet was weak enough to receive him into favour again, and give him another opportunity to re∣peat his treason. His motive for acting in this perfidious manner, was the desire of being revenged upon the king, for having exiled him after the death of his father, on account of some misconduct or treasonable practices, for which Ethelred, who was his relation, had pardoned and restored him to his possessions. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Hitherto the Danish invasions had been no other than petty enter∣prizes, atchieved by private adventurers: but, now Swein and Anlaf, kings of Denmark and Norway, allured by the success of their subjects, resolved to have a share of the spoils of England. For this purpose they equipped a nu∣merous fleet, and sailing up the Humber, ravaged Lindsey, and wasted the greatest part of Yorkshire. A body of troops was assembled to oppose them, and put under the command of three counts, who being of Danish extraction, betrayed their trust, and betook themselves to flight in the very beginning of the engagement; so that the English were routed, and the country became a prey to the conquerors. Here the victors fixed their winter-quarters, and in the spring sailing towards the Thames, entered that river without opposition; then landing their troops, made several attempts upon London; but meeting with more resistance than they had expected, they desisted from that enterprize, and penetrated into the provinces of Kent, Hampshire, and Sussex, which they laid waste with fire and sword. As they threatened to over-run the whole king∣dom in the same manner, Ethelred, being destitute of all means of opposition, had recourse to his former expedient, and promised to pay a considerable sum of money within a specified time, on condition that they would immediately put a stop to hostilities, and quit the kingdom, as soon as they should receive the tri∣bute. The proposal was embraced, and the two kings retired to Southampton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 994.</NOTE> from whence Anlaf came to visit Ethelred, who persuaded him to be baptized: he had no sooner declared himself a christian, than he promised upon oath, that he would never molest the country of England again, and he kept his word<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor.

<P>Those two princes set sail together for Denmark, though with ve∣ry different intentions; those of Anlaf were not more pacific, than Swein's were savage and hostile towards the English king. He left a fleet at Southampton, commanded by an officer who had orders to press the payment of the money; and if that should be delayed, to right himself with the sword. He accordingly demanded the immediate execution of the treaty, in the most peremptory man∣ner; and as Ethelred found great difficulty in raising the money, he construed the delay into a refusal, and resolved to renew the war. Finding the country ad∣joining to his quarters in a posture of defence, he sailed round the Land's end of Cornwal, and entering the river Severne, made a descent upon Wales, which he desolated with the utmost cruelty; then he penetrated into Dorsetshire, which met with the same deplorable fate, and defeated the troops that were raised for the defence of the country. Having ruined and pillaged whole provinces without further opposition, they re-imbarked, and sailed back to the coast of Kent, where an effort made by the inhabitants to check their progress, served only to incense them to a greater degree of barbarity and revenge, which they gratified with the most inhuman brutality; and what compleated the misery of England,

<P>The nation was then upon the verge of ruin, when it was delivered for the present by the dangerous situation of Richard II. duke of Normandy, who, being threatened by the king of France with the loss of his dominions, called the Danes over to his assistance. By this accident Ethelred gained a re∣mission of some months, during which, however, he does not seem to have taken any measures for the protection of his subjects: for the Danes, after hav∣ing secured Richard in his dukedom, returned to Britain, which they found as defenceless as before. They again ravaged Wales, over-ran Wessex, reduced Exeter, and filled the country with such consternation, that the inhabitants fled before them, and the king was seized with a panic that prevented him from taking the field in person, or forming any resolution in behalf of his subjects. The Danes proceeded without let or molestation, until they had subdued the Isle of Wight, together with the counties of Hants and Dorset, where they established magazines, and from whence they made irruptions into the neigh∣bouring districts. While the southern parts of the kingdom were thus ravaged by the foreign Danes, the northern provinces were occupied by the English breed of the same nation, who, instead of fighting in defence of what was now their country, joined their countrymen, and contributed to its destruction.</P>

<P>Ethelred seeing his realm reduced to this miserable situation, obeyed the dictates of his fear and despondence, and sumittted to pay thirty thousand pounds to those invaders; a sum that was raised by a tax distinguished by the name of Danegelt. In consideration of this tribute, the main body of Danes retired to their own country; though a good number chose to fix their habita∣tion in England, where being supported by the natives of the same race, they became extremely insolent and oppressive, living at their ease upon the labour of the English, who were by this time so dispirited by their past misfortunes, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Ethelred finding by experience how little he could depend upon his own subjects in such calamitous conjunctures, resolved to strengthen his hands by an alliance, from which he promised himself assistance and security. The duke of Normandy had hitherto favoured the Danes, who were indeed his own countrymen, in all their expeditions to England; and as his ports were exact∣ly opposite to the British coast, those pyrates found great convenience in being able to run across the channel occasionally, and secure their plunder by return∣ing to the Norman harbours. Ethelred, on the supposition that they would not only be deprived of this advantage, but also diverted from attacking his do∣minions, if he could form a strong connexion with Richard, sent ambassadors to demand of that duke his sister Emma in marriage; and the Norman willing∣ly subscribed to the proposal. The lady was brought over to England, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>02.</NOTE> the nuptials were solemnized with great splendour; and in all probability Ethel∣red might have been benefited by the alliance, had not he defeated all the pur∣poses of the match by contriving and executing a most execrable and impolitic plan, which intailed upon him the hatred of the Normans, and the revenge of the Danish monarch.</P>

<P>Of himself he was weak, fearful, and indolent; therefore we are to suppose that he was instigated on this occasion by the advice of his favourite

counsellors, Huna, general of his army, and Edric Streona, duke of Mercia, whose villainy and misconduct had in a great measure contributed to the distress of the nation. These unprincipled traitors industriously stimulated the king's re∣sentment against the Danes, who lately fixed their residence among the English, by exaggerating the pride and insolence of those people, and representing in ag∣gravated colours the outrages they daily committed, through meer wantonness of oppression. Having roused his resentment, they likewise interested his fear, by alarming him with feigned discoveries of a conspiracy those Danes had form∣ed to deprive him of his life; and, while his passions were in a fermentation, proposed that he should anticipate their design by making a general massacre of all the Danes in England, except those possessed of East-Anglia and Northumber∣land, who were too numerous to be mastered by the few English residing in those countries.</P>

<P>They found means to draw such an agreeable prospect of the con∣sequences which would attend this inhuman sacrifice, that the impotent prince agreed to the proposal, and measures were instantly concerted for carrying it into execution. The orders were so distinct, and circulated with such secrecy, that the miserable victims never dreamed of the horrible vengeance that hung over their heads, and on St. Brice's day, the time fixed for the massacre, they were all butchered by the vindictive Saxons, without distinction of age or sex. It was not so much a sacrifice to liberty, as a feast of carnage to gratify revenge, for the slaughter was attended with circumstances of the most savage cruelty. The ruffian Edric distinguished himself in this scene of blood, by an action for which his memory must always be held in horror and detestation. The peace with Swein, king of Denmark, had been principally effected by the mediation of his sister Gunilda, who had embraced the christian faith, and married count Puling, an English nobleman; so that she considered England as her native country, and voluntarily offered herself and family as hostages for her brother's punctual observance of the treaty. From that day she lived under the eye of Edric, who from meer wantonness of barbarity, devoted this unfortunate prin∣cess to death among the undistinguished crouds of her countrymen. He com∣manded her husband and children to be butchered in her presence, and herself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wallingford. Hunting. G. Malmesb. Chron.

<P>Some of the Danes, more prudent than the rest, instead of flying to churches and altars, which the English polluted with their blood, took refuge on board of a vessel, and, hoisting sail for Denmark, carried the news of the massacre to Swein, who was determined to take vengeance on the perpetrators, even before he was made acquainted with the fate of his beloved sister. But when he heard the particulars of her deplorable catastrophe, he was transported with the most furious indignation, and swore he would never sit down in peace, until he should have revenged such a horrible outrage, with the ruin of the English nation. He forthwith began to make preparations for the performance of this dreadful oath. He ordered all the men at arms within his kingdom to assemble at a certain rendezvous, and invited all soldiers of fortune from every country, with promise of ample rewards in the plunder or property of England. At the same time he employed an infinite number of artificers in equipping a very powerful navy; and as the whole nation was animated with a surprising

This consummate tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor advanced into Hampshire, to which Swein had by this time penetrated; and the two armies were already in sight of each other, when Alfric pretended to be taken suddenly ill, and or∣dered his troops to retire, without hazarding an engagement; a retreat which permitted Swein to pillage Wiltshire, without opposition, and burn and destroy Wilton, and Salisbury, which was the scene of his sister's murder.

A y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar being elapsed since the conclusion of the treaty, Swein sent a numb eof ship to demand another sum equal to that which he had received;

pretending that it was an annual tribute, which the English had obliged them∣selves to pay. Ethelred and his council, alarmed at this insolent demand, and foreseeing no end to the imposition, resolved to employ that money in a more ef∣fectual<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1007.</NOTE> manner for the protection of the kingdom, and ordered ships to be built with all possible dispatch in all the harbours and docks of England; every three hundred and ten hides of land being obliged to furnish and maintain one vessel: so that, in a very little time, he was master of a larger fleet than had ever be∣longed to any of his predecessors. Yet, this powerful armament, which rendez∣voused<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

Brightric, transport∣ed with the rage of disappointed resentment, put to sea immediately with four∣score ships, in pursuit of the fugitive, and was overtaken by a tempest that drove the greatest part of the fleet ashore, where it was burned by Wulfnoth.

<P>Mean while the Danes did not fail to take the advantage of those disorders: two fleets of those pyrates arrived in the spring, under the command of three generals, who joining their forces in Kent, ravaged the country, and then in∣vested Canterbury, which would have fallen into their hands, had not the inhabi∣tants redeemed themselves with a large sum of money. While these freebooters were employed in pillaging Kent, Ethelred assembled an army which he headed in per∣son, and took possession of a strong post, with a view to intercept the enemy in their return to the sea-side. As the troops were superior to the Danes in number, advantageously posted, and in good spirits, in all probability this effort might have been attended with success, had not the treacherous Edric Streon pre∣vented the action, by dissuading the king from exposing his life to the hazard of a battle against an enemy of such approved valour and experienced cruelty. Alarmed by these artful insinuations, the timorous Ethelred allowed the Danes to pass along quietly with their booty, which they did not immediately convey to Denmark, but fixed their winter-quarters in the isle of Thanet; from whence they made divers incursions into the neighbouring country, and made repeated attempts upon London, from which, however, they were always repulsed.</P>

<P>The reader will doubtless be amazed at the infatuation of this unhappy prince, who not only employed the worst of traitors in the first offices of the kingdom, even after he had suffered by repeated instances of their per∣fidy; but consented to impoverish his country by raising such exorbitant sums, which far from satisfying, served only to whet the avarice of those invaders, and encourage the rest of their countrymen to engage in the like enterprizes. Scarce had the English begun to taste the happiness of their deliverance, when Swein entered the Humber with such a powerful armament as threatened the whole kingdom with desolation. He saw not the least shadow of opposition in making himself master of Northumberland, East Anglia, and all the country to the northward of Watling-street; but not contented with these conquests, he took hostages from the principal towns, and leaving the government of the province he had subdued to his son Canute, he made an unsuccessful attempt upon London; from whence he marched into Wessex, which he plundered at his lei∣sure, for there was not the face of an enemy to be seen. Resolved to reduce Lon∣don, he began to make preparations for the siege of that city; but, while he was thus employed, the unhappy Ethelred, seeing there was no safety for him in his own kingdom, retired privately to the isle of Wight, from whence he sent his two sons into Normandy, with their mother Emma, in order to prevail upon Richard to afford him refuge in his dominions. That prince, though he knew his sister had been unworthily treated by Ethelred, sacrificed his resentment to his magnanimity, and invited the English monarch to his court, where he met with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

As for the inhabitants of London, they thought themselves at liberty, by the king's abdication and retreat, to provide for their own safety; and as the place was not in a condition to sustain a siege, they sub∣mitted to the king of Denmark, who had by this time subjected all the rest of the kingdom; and Swein was proclaimed king of England, in which there<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The first act of sovereignty he exercised, was in laying an insup∣portable tax on the people; but he did not live to see it exacted; for, in a few months after the surrender of London, he called an assembly of his principal of∣ficers at Gainsborough, and died suddenly before the council broke up. The monks pretended he was mortally wounded by the spirit of St. Edmund, because he threatened to lay under contribution the monastery in which that monarch was interred; but in all probability he was poisoned by those honest ecclesiastics, who began to perceive that he would pay very little regard to their privileges and exemptions. After his death, the Danes proclaimed his son Canute king of England; but, in spite of all the menaces and intrigues of those invaders, the English recalled Ethelred, and promised to stand by him with their lives and for∣tunes,
<PB N="177" REF="1860"/>
in opposition to the Danes, whose dominion they could not endure. At first he suspected their fidelity, but sent over his son Edmund to sound their in∣tentions; and that prince met with such a favourable reception, that the fa∣ther returned to England amidst the joyful acclamations of the people, who took the oath of allegiance anew, and he on his part promised to amend his administration.</P>

<P>Such was the ardour of the English to shake off the Danish yoke, that they flocked to his standard from all quarters; and in a little time he found himself at the head of a numerous army, with which he marched directly to Lindsey against Canute, who had agreed with the inhabitants of that country for horses to mount his cavalry. He was so surprized at the sudden approach and activity of Ethelred, who had hitherto been dilatory even to a proverb, that he retreated to his ships with precipitation, and set sail for Denmark, leav∣ing his friends at Lindsey to the mercy of the English monarch, who destroyed their habitations, and punished their persons with the utmost severity. Canute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Sax.</NOTE> before he directed his course towards his own country, touched at Sandwich, where he sent ashore all the English hostages, without their hands and noses; a barbarous mutilation which no provocation could justify. It was not so much the fear of Ethelred's arms that induced him to leave the kingdom at this juncture, as the ambition of his own younger brother Harold, who at his fa∣ther's death had attempted to ascend the throne of Denmark, which Canute was not at all disposed to give up for the uncertain prospect of succeeding in his designs upon England.</P>

<P>Ethelred no sooner saw himself delivered from the Danes, than he re∣lapsed into his former indolence and misconduct. He imposed exorbitant taxes, against which the subjects loudly exclaimed; and was guilty of such acts of op∣pression, that the people began to despair of his promised reformation. Morcart and Sigeferth, two noblemen of Danish extraction, who had been always faithful to his interest, were now sacrificed to his avarice. During the session of a general council at Oxford, Edric the execrable duke of Mercia, and son-in law to the king, employed assass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s by whom they were murdered; and Ethelred imme∣diately confiscated their estates for his own use, as if they had been fairly con∣demned in the ordinary course of law; while Sigeferth's widow Algitha was shut up in a cloister; though to this confinement she afterwards owed her elevat∣ed fortune. Edmund the king's eldest son chancing to pass by the monastery in which she was immured, had the curiosity to visit the lady of whose beauty he had heard a very favourable report, and became so enamoured of her charms that he married her without his father's consent. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Dun.</NOTE></P>

<P>The calm enjoyed by England after the retreat of Canute, was of very short duration: that prince having secured himself in possession of his pa∣ternal crown, resumed his design upon this country; and when he was least ex∣pected, landed with a numerous body of forces at Sandwich. Ethelred him∣self being indisposed, his son Edmund and the traitor Streon Duke of Mercia took the command of the army, and the prince was in a very little time con∣vinced of the treachery of his brother-in-law. But, as he durst not punish him upon the spot, lest he should incur the hatred of the Mercians, among whom Edric had great influence, and the displeasure of his father, who could not be persuaded that the duke carried on a treasonable correspondence with the enemy,
<PB N="178" REF="1870"/>
he divided the army into two bodies, that he might have the opportunity of act∣ing separately from such a persidious miscreant, who finding himself thus baf∣fled in his favourite aim, which was to betray Edmund, pulled off the mask, and openly declared for Canute. If his defection had affected only his own im∣mediate vassals, Ethelred would have been a gainer by his desertion; but he car∣ried off a considerable body of troops, and forty ships of the navy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>Such an accession of power to Canute enabled that prince to exe∣cute all his projects without the least difficulty; and the English people joined him in crouds, rather than be involved in the ruin of Ethelred, who was at length persuaded by his son to put himself at the head of his army, in order to strike some decisive blow, by which alone he had any chance of retrieving his affairs. The presence of the king and the popularity of Edmund had still such influence among the English, that great numbers repaired to the royal standard; and as they were now actuated by a furious kind of despair, the Danes might have had cause to rue the encounter: but this opportunity was lost by the shameful cowardice of Ethelred, who, pretending to have discovered a design of betraying his person to the enemy, retired precipitately to London; and the Mer∣cians refusing to serve when the monarch was no longer in the field, the army was so weakened by their secession, that Edmund could not pretend to ha∣zard a battle with the Danes.</P>

<P>In this emergency he retired to the north, where he joined Uthred count of Northumberland, who had married his sister Elfgiva, and ravaged the provinces which had declared for the Danes. But Canute did not leave his friends long exposed to these hostilities; for, having subdued the greatest part of the southern counties, he marched to their assistance, and at his approach Ed∣mund and Uthred retired into Lancashire. Even there they found themselves so hard pressed by the enemy that Uthred submitted to the Danish king, who allowed him to enjoy his government; but afterwards ordered him to be put to death, and appointed a Danish governour in his room.

But the rest of the

<P>Canute, taking advantage of his absence, sailed up the river Thames, in hope of reducing the city of London, which was the chief resource of Edmund; and from which he had been formerly repulsed by the valour of the inhabitants. He now turned the river into a new channel on the Surry side, and surrounded the whole city with his works; but he still met with such a warm re∣ception, that he was once more obliged to desist from his enterprize, and march∣ed into the country of Wessex, where he hoped to find Edmund unprepared for his reception. The two armies met at Penne in Somersetshire, and a battle en∣suing, Edmund obtained the victory: so that Canute was obliged to retreat to Winchester, until his army could be recruited; and while he remained in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Florent.

<HEAD>§ XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>Edmund's army being considerably reinforced in consequence of the advanrage he had gained, he marched after Midsummer to the relief of that city, and was followed by Canute, strengthened by the men of Hants and Wilt∣shire, and a great number of English under the comand of the traitor Edric, and two noblemen called Algar and Almar. Edmund, at the head of an army levied in the counties of Cornwal, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset, waited for him, at a place called Sceorstan on the borders of Worcester; and there the battle began with great fury. The two opposite princes were well matched in courage, conduct, and experience; and both armies were nearly equal in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1016.</NOTE> strength, though the Danes had a manifest advantage in point of discipline. Never was battle fought with more obstinacy and perseverance. It lasted until night parted the combatants, and next day was renewed with fresh vigour. At length the Danes seemed to flag; and the victory would, in all probability, have declared for Ironside, had not their drooping courage been revived by a strata∣gem of the perfidious Edric, who, cutting off the head of one Osmer, who re∣sembled that prince, and exposing it on the point of a spear, called aloud to the English to quit the field, for Edmund was slain. This contrivance would have answered his purpose, in dispiriting the Saxons and animating the Danes, had not Edmund immediately lifted up his beaver, and shewn himself to his soldiers. Having taken this necessary precaution, he rode up towards the treacherous Edric, and darted a javelin at him with such force, that though it missed the traitor, it pinned his next man to the soldier that stood behind him, and both fell breathless on the field. This gallant atchievement, and indeed his whole behaviour during the battle, inspired his army with such vigour, that it required all the conduct and intrepidity of his antagonist to keep his ground, until the second night suspended the dispute. But, Canute foreseeing that he should not be able to maintain a third shock, retired privately, by the help of a dark night, and returned to his ships that were still in the Thames, in order to renew the siege of London. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

<P>Edmund, sensible that he was in no condition, after two such engagements, to march immediately to the relief of that city, beleaguered by such a number of Danes, retired into Wessex, to repair the damage he had sustained;
<PB N="180" REF="1890"/>
and in this interval Edric assailed him with such professions of sorrow and contrition, and promises and oaths of future fidelity, that the unwary prince, believing h m sincere, took him again into favour, thinking by such an acquisition to weaken the hands of his enemies. He had no sooner received the necessary reinforcements than he began his march towards London, and compelled the Danes to raise the siege. Part of their army embarked on board of their ships, and the rest advanced up the river to Brentford, where the gallant Edmund<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Malmes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> passing the river in the very face of their troops, attacked and routed them with great slaughter. After this action he returned to Wessex, and Canute seized that opportunity to renew his attacks upon London; but as he could never block it up entirely, and the citizens defended themselves with extraordinary valour, all his attempts miscarried. Thus baffled he embarked his troops, and sai ing into the river Orwel, that divides Essex from Suffolk, laid the country under contributions; from thence they directed their course to the mouth of the Medway, and landing their horse, ravaged the whole county of Kent, until Ed∣mund being informed of these devastations, passed the river Thames again at Brentford, and attacking them at Ottenford, drove them before him into the isle of Sheppey. Perhaps this day might have put an end to the war, had not the traitor Edric found means to dissuade the victor from continuing the pur∣suit; so that the Danes accomplished a retreat to their ships, and were wafted over into Essex, where they recruited their forces.</P>

<P>Then they reinvaded Mercia, wreaking their vengeance upon every thing belonging to the adherents of Edmund, who now resolving to strike a decisive blow, advanced against them with a strong army, and overtook them at Ashdown, in Essex. Here the battle joined with great impetuosity, and the English king made such extraordinary efforts of personal bravery, that victory was on the point of declaring in his favour, when the infamous Edric gave way with the whole wing which he commanded; a circumstance that pro∣duced such disorder and consternation among the English, that all the endea∣vours of Edmund proved ineffectual to restore the fortune of the day: his ar∣my was totally defeated; and this overthrow was the more unfortunate, as the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.

<P>This stroke, severe as it was, did not extinguish the hopes, or subdue the fortitude of Edmund, who retired to Gloucester, almost without attendants; but, he was so much beloved and admired by his subjects, that they exerted their utmost power and faculties in supplying his wants: so that in a very little time he was enabled to take the field against his conqueror, who had already marched into that part of the country, to prevent him from retrieving his affairs. Those two great princes were again in sight of each other; but no longer so forward, as they had been formerly, to engage. They knew that another battle must be decisive, because the vanquished would be without resource; and there∣fore they were very cautious in managing this last stake. During this pause Ed∣mund is said to have proposed, that he and Canute should decide the dispute in single combat, in order to spare the effusion of blood; and Canute replied to the proposal, that if the business was only to manifest his personal courage, he would willingly accept the challenge; but he apprehended it would be a very
<PB N="181" REF="1900"/>
unwise and impolitic step in him, who was a man of small diminutive stature, to risque his life and kingdom upon the issue of a duel, with a person of Ed∣mund's robust make and uncommon agility. However, as his antagonist had expressed an inclination to spare the effusion of blood, he was ready to open conferences on the subject of peace, and would leave the articles to the deter∣mination of the principal officers of both armies. This proposition was eagerly embraced by Edmund, and an equal number of commissioners being appointed on each side, they assembled on the little island of Alney, in the Severne; and after a short conference, a treaty of peace was concluded, and the kingdom di∣vided between the two competitors<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Huntingdon and Matthew of Westminster relate, that the noblemen of each army, wearied with incessant war and fatigue, declared open∣ly, that as Edmund and Canute wanted to reign singly, they ought to fight singly, and decide the contention between themselves. The kings being informed of these clamours, agreed to fight in single combat, and the island of Alney was appointed for the lists. There they met in ar∣mour, while their respective armies lined the op∣posite sides of the river, and a most furious en∣counter ensued. At last the Dane, finding his strength exhausted, defired a parley, and pro∣posed a partition of the kingdom; to which Ed∣mund consented, and then throwing away their swords, they ran into each other's embrace, to the equal joy and astonishment of both armies. The articles of the treaty were immediately spe∣cified and confirmed, and the two kings parted in amity.</NOTE>. All the country to the southward of the Thames, together with the city of London, and part of the antient kingdom of Essex, was assigned to Edmund; and all the rest of England was allotted to Ca∣nute. This division was approved by the two kings, who ratified the peace by oath and the exchange of armour: then the Dane retired to his own dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim. Dunelm. Wallingford. Rudborne.</NOTE> Edmund did not survive this convention above a month; for, his brother-in∣law Edric, fearing that his ruin would be a necessary consequence of this treaty, completed his treachery by suborning two domestics to murder the king at Oxford. Thus fell the gallant Edmund by inglorious hands, before he had reigned a full year; though in that short period he had exhibited repeated proofs of the most undaunted courage, invincible fortitude, consummate prudence, and sublime generosity. The execrable Edric was the first person who carried the tidings of Edmund's death to Canute, making a merit of what he had done for his service <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The manner of his death is variously re∣ported; some authors alledge that the two servants, hired for that purpose, thrust a sharp iron into his fundament, while he was easing na∣ture; others say the fact was perpetrated by Edric's own son; while a third set affirm he was taken off by poison. Be that as it will, he left by his wife Algitha, two sons called Ed∣mund and Edward; and a natural son of the name of Edwy, who was afterwards put to death by Canute's order.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE Dane was shocked at the barbarity of the murder; but he dis∣guised his sentiments, because he had further occasion for the traitor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and even promised to exalt him above all the nobility of the kingdom; an aequi∣vocal expression, which was literally verified, in a manner widely different from Edric's expectation. In the mean time Canute resolved to make himself master of the kingdom of Wessex, without paying any regard to the title of Edmund's two sons, or that of his brothers, who resided in Normandy: but as he would not seize it in quality of a conqueror, he assembled the states at London, after his emissaries had tutored the individual members in private, and claimed the succession by virtue of the treaty concluded in the isle of Alney, which he pre∣tended to interpret in a sense implying, that the survivor should inherit the do∣minions of the deceased, without any regard to the children of either. The states of Wessex, dreading the prospect of another war, and yet unwilling to in∣jure the right of their own royal family, insinuated to Canute, that they would willingly consent to his reigning over them as guardian to Edmund's eldest son: but he refused to accept the crown on such precarious terms, and openly demanded in the assembly, of those who had been present at the treaty, whether or not any thing had been stipulated in favour of Edmund's children? When those noble∣men replied, that their names had not been mentioned on that occasion, he in∣terpreted this silence into a confirmation of his claim; and there was no person present who had honesty and courage enough to oppose such a palpable usurpa∣tion. They unanimously acknowledged his title. He was immediately pro∣claimed king of all England. The Danish and English noblemen took the oath of allegiance, and he was afterwards crowned with great solemnity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig.</NOTE></P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after his coronation, he divided England into the four great governments of Mercia, Northumberland, East-Anglia, and Wessex. The first he conferred upon the infamous Edric Streon; the second he gave to Erick; the third was bestowed upon Turkell; and he reserved Wessex to himself, without appointing either duke or count of that province.</P>
<P>As he very well knew that a number of English noblemen repined in their hearts at his accession to the throne, and that the people in general were strongly attached to the race of Cerdic, his first aim was to ingratiate himself with his new subjects by popular measures; and to take the first opportunity of removing those who were the most likely and capable to disturb his government. With that view he affected to declare that he would make no difference between Danes and English in his favours and administration; and then published an edict importing, that the old laws should be observed in every province, as they were in the time of the Saxons; excepting however the provinces of the north, which were almost wholly peopled with Danes, who had been long governed by the laws of their own original country. This appearance of justice and impartia∣lity had great weight with the people, who looked upon them as happy omens
<PB N="184" REF="1930"/>
of peace and satisfaction; and every mouth was filled with the praises of this equi∣table prince, who seemed to have nothing in view but the welfare of his subjects.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Canute having so far succeeded in his scheme, resolved to rid his hands of the two royal infants, believing, that while they lived he should never possess the throne in peace. He would not venture to take away their lives in England, though the traitor Edric would have gladly undertaken the task, be∣cause their death would have been naturally laid to his charge; and such a sus∣picion might have sapped the foundations of his government. He therefore, on pretence of sending them to travel, committed them to the care of a trusty Dane, who had orders to take some effectual method to prevent them from re∣turning to England.</P>

<P>This minister, less barbarous than his master, compassionating the situ∣ation of those hapless orphans, instead of carrying them to Denmark, according to the instructions he had received, conveyed them to the king of Sweden, whom he had made acquainted with Canute's intentions. That prince, what∣ever abhorrence he conceived of this inhuman design, was unwilling to incur the displeasure of Canute, by entertaining them at his court; he therefore sent them to Solomon, king of Hungary, from whom they met with a very hospi∣table reception. Edwin died at this court, but Edward married the queen of Hungary's sister Agatha, daughter of Henry II. emperor of Germany, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> whom he had Edgar Athelin, and Margaret, afterwards queen of Scotland. There still remained in England two sons of Ethelred II. one legitimate, the other a bastard; though both were known by the name of Edwy. Even these Canute looked upon as obstacles to his interest, and banished from the kingdom; the first however he afterwards recalled, on pretence of bestowing upon him marks of his favour, and then found means to deprive him of his life.</P>

<P>But he could contrive no scheme for the destruction of Edmund's bro∣thers, Alfred and Edward, who resided with their uncle Richard II. duke of Normandy, and might be one day enabled by that prince to assert their title to the throne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In order to avert that danger, he endeavoured to engage Richard in his interest, by demanding in marriage his sister Emma, the mother of the young<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1011.</NOTE> princes, and offering his own sister to the Norman. Richard and Emma assent∣ed to the proposal; and the double marriage was celebrated accordingly, to the unspeakable chagrin of the two princes, who never could forgive their mo∣ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">William of Malmesbury. Flor. Wig. Chron. Sax.</NOTE> for espousing the inveterate enemy of her first husband, and much less for defrauding them of their right, by subscribing to a marriage-contract, which set∣tled the succession of the crown upon the issue of the marriage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>Canute having taken these precautions, to establish himself firmly on the throne of England, thought nothing was now wanting to render his authority ab∣solute, but the death of some noblemen, whom he dreaded for their power, or hated for their dissaffection. The principal of these were, the dukes of Mercia and East-Anglia, and the count of Northumberland He knew Edric Streon to be an infa∣mous traitor, upon whose fidelity he could not rely, and therefore doomed him as the first victim to his own security. With respect to this wretch, his interest and equity in a very little time chanced to coincide; for, Edric was rash enough to tell him in public, that he had not been rewarded according to his services; and in particular made a merit of having taken away the life of Edmund, in
<PB N="185" REF="1940"/>
consequence of which Canute had ascended the throne. He had no sooner pro∣nounced these words, than Canute regarding him with a stern look, <Q>“Since, said he, thou hast owned thyself guilty of that execrable treason, thou standest self∣convicted, and shalt immediately suffer the punishment thou hast deserved by such an atrocious crime.”</Q> So saying, he ordered him to be beheaded on the spot; then his body was thrown into the Thames, and his head fixed upon the highest part of the tower, that his promise to Edric might be literally ful∣filled. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Huntingdon.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after this execution, a pretence was found for banishing Eric, count of Northumberland; and Turkil, duke of East-Anglia, fearing his turn would be the next, thought proper to anticipate his sate by going into vo∣luntary exile. Several other noblemen of less consideration were sacrificed to the king's jealousy, and their offices filled with his own creatures; and now be∣ing secure from all check or controul, he ventured to saddle the nation with a tax, for raising eighty thousand pounds, to pay off the arrears of the Danish ar∣my, the greatest part of which was sent back to his own country. Howsoever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Chron. Sax.</NOTE> grievous this tax might be, the English chearfully contributed towards an im∣position that would be the means of freeing them from such disagreeable guests; and their acquiescence in the king's pleasure was in a good measure owing to their comparing the present tranquillity they enjoyed, with the miseries of war they had so lately undergone.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Canute, having thus provided for the peace and security of the king∣dom, resolved to visit his own country, where his presence was necessary to pro∣secute a war which had broke out between the Danes and the Vandals. He ac∣cordingly set sail with a body of English troops, commanded by earl Goodwin, and accompanied by all the noblemen whom he thought the most likely to raise disturbances in his absence. He arrived in Denmark at a very critical conjunc∣ture, when the Vandals had actually penetrated into his country; and taking the field without delay, advanced in order to give them battle. But during the night that preceded the day fixed for the engagement, Goodwin, at the head of the English troops, charged the enemy with such impetuosity, that they were totally routed with great slaughter; and Canute in the morning found a victory before<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb. An. Ch. 1020.</NOTE> he knew any thing of a battle. This exploit endeared the English to his affection, and raised Goodwin to such a degree in his favour, that he gave him in marriage Thyra his own sister-in-law, and maintained him in all the power and splendour of the ducal dignity, at a time when he strove to reduce in others that exorbitant authority which had been wrested from the crown in times of trouble and confusion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb.

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>This war being happily finished, he returned to England, and hence∣forth made no distinction between Dane and Saxon, in the distribution of his favours. Justice was administered with the utmost partiality, and the people enjoyed peace and affluence under his equal administration. Yet, in order to re∣commend himself still more warmly to the affection of his English subjects, he built churches at all the places which were distinguished by the slaughter of the Saxons during his struggle for the crown: he erected chantries, in which conti∣nual prayers were said for the souls of the slain, repaired some monasteries which had suffered by the Danes, and founded a new convent at Bury, in honour of St. Edmund, who had been murdered an hundred and fifty years before this period, by his ancestors, and was highly reverenced all over England. He con∣voked
<PB N="186" REF="1950"/>
the states at Winchester, where Thurketyl was outlawed for having been concerned in the murder of St. Alfage; and many other popular laws were enacted. Those of Edward I. were translated into Latin for the use of Den∣mark; and Canute redoubled his industry in taking every step that could ren∣der him agreeable to the English nation. About this period, understanding that Anlaf or Olave king of Norway was despised and hated by his subjects, because he restrained them from the exercise of rapine, to which they had been so long accustommed; he, in order to take advantage of their discontent, sent over large fums of money to corrupt the noblemen, and raise a strong party in his fa∣vour: but before he could bring his project to bear, his own dominions in Denmark were invaded by the Swedes. Alarmed at this attempt, he set sail for that kingdom, and engaged Ulf and Eglaf, the two Swedish generals, who de∣seated him in a pitched battle; so that he was fain to return that same year to England. He succeeded better, however, in his designs upon Norway, whither he sailed with a powerful fleet, and took possession of that kingdom, while<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1030.</NOTE> Olave fled for refuge into Sweden. About two years after his expulsion he made an attempt to recover his crown; but being deserted by part of the forces he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Sim. Dunelm.</NOTE> had assembled, and overpowered by numbers, he lost his life in the battle of Stucklastad.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>As for Canute, notwithstanding all the pains he had taken to establish his authority, a conspiracy was formed against his life, by one Hacum, a Danish nobleman, who had married his niece; but it was happily discovered, and the traitor sent into banishment. This danger was succeeded by another, which had like to have been attended with very important consequences. The dukedom of Nor∣mandy having devolved to Robert, son of Richard II. he resolved to espouse the in∣terest of his cousins Alfred and Edward, the sons of Ethelred, who still resided in that country; and actually sent ambassadors to demand of Canute the inheri∣tance of those princes. His embassy being disregarded, he equipped a powerful fleet, in order to invade England; but his ships were so damaged and dispersed by a storm, that the enterprize miscarried; though he still continued to make prepa∣rations for a second trial. Canute being informed of his intention, and well acquainted with his great power, thought proper to temporize, and make pro∣posals of accommodation. He even offered to resign some part of Wessex to the princes, during his own life; and found means to protract the negotiation, until Robert undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The expedition to England was therefore postoned 'till his return, which never happened, and his dukedom devolved to his bastard son William, who afterwards mounted the English throne, under the name of the Conqueror.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1031.</NOTE> This storm being blown over, Canute devoted his chief attention to works of piety; and as he had founded his power in blood, he set out on a jour∣ney to Rome, where he hoped to obtain a full absolution for all his sins. Even in the execution of this religious scheme, he did not forget the interest of his people, but purchased an exemption from toll and duties in savour of the Eng∣lish merchants and pilgrims, through all the dominions that lay in his way. He likewise obtained from the pope some privileges for the English college in Rome, and a mitigation of the expence incurred by metropolitans in the article of the pall, as well as certain favours and immunities for the pilgrims of his country, who went to visit the tombs of the apostles. Having made sumptuous presents
<PB N="187" REF="1960"/>
to his holiness and the churches of that capital, he returned by the way of Den∣mark, and on the road sent Livignus, abbot of Tavistock, the companion of his travels, with a letter to the English nobility, exhorting all sheriffs and ma∣gistrates to administer justice impartially, in particular to protect the poor from oppression; and see the church-dues regularly payed to the clergy. Nor did his conduct belye his professions; for, when he arrived in England, he ordered all the Saxon laws to be inviolably observed; forbad markets, fairs, and other secular assemblies on Sunday, and enjoined all christians to come thrice a year and receive the eucharist. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesh.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The last military expedition he undertook, was against Malcolm II. king of Scotland, who while he possessed the county of Cumberland as heir appa∣rent to the Scottish throne, had refused to contribute towards the Danegelt raised by Ethelred; and bravely replied, that he was ready to pay the enemy with steel but not with silver. This answer incensed Ethelred to such a degree, that he employed against him the armament which had been prepared against the Danes, in wasting the country of Cumberland; but, that quarrel was compromised. When the Danes over-ran England, Malcolm refused to do homage or pay tribute to their kings, whom he considered as usurpers; and he had defeated divers ar∣mies of that kingdom, who had landed in Scotland, with their families, to make settlements in the country: at length a peace had been concluded between him and Canute, which was inviolably preserved by the Dane till such time as he found it convenient to forget the articles. Malcolm's grandson Duncan, a prince of slender abilities, was now prince of Cumberland, as heir apparent of the Scottish crown; and he refusing to pay homage to Canute, the Danish ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, after his pil∣grimage to Rome, assembled an army, in order to reduce Cumberland by force of arms. Malcolm, in behalf of his grandson, advanced with another to give him battle, and a furious engagement would have ensued, had not the prelates and noblemen of both armies interposed their mediation, and effected a peace; by which it was agreed, that Duncan from the time being, and all his successors princes of Scotland, should hold Cumberland according to the original tenour, and do homage for that fief to Canute and his successors kings of England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.

<P>After this accommodation Canute met with nothing to disturb his tranquillity. From his conquests he derived the surname of Great; but, he merited that epithet much more by the virtues he manifested during the paci∣fic period of his administration. Though he had shed an ocean of blood, and trampled under foot all laws divine and human, in making his way to the throne, he was no sooner established in the regal authority, than he seemed to change his disposition, and became conspicuous for his justice, piety, and moderation, so as to acquire the love of his subjects and the esteem of mankind<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Huntingdon relates an instance of his beha∣viour in private life, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gued his good sense and abhorrence of flattery. One day, while he walked on the sea shore, accompanied by his courtiers, who offered the grossest incense of adulation, and even compared his power to that of the Dei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, he ordered a chair to be placed upon the beach, while the tide was mak∣ing; and sitting down, commanded the sea to re∣tire; but being in a little time surrounded with water, he rose up and chid his flatterers for having bestowed upon him those encomiums which were due to God alone. From that mo∣ment he never would wear the crown, but or∣dered it to be placed upon the head of a cruci∣fix in the church at Winchester.</NOTE>. In this hap∣py<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1035.</NOTE> situation, he lived several years, and at length resigned his being at Shaftes∣bury,
<PB N="188" REF="1970"/>
in the nineteenth year of his reign, leaving by his first wife, who was daughter to the earl of Northampton, two sons called Swein and Harold; and by Emma, who survived him, another named Hardicnute, and a daughter called Gunilda, who was married to Henry III. emperor of Germany.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>Canute, before his death, had established his son Hardicnute on the throne of Denmark, and given Norway to Swein; but, as he had not mentioned a successor for the kingdom of England, a contest ensued among his children, and the English prelates and nobility were divided into three parties. But the chief dispute lay between the partizans of Harold and Hardi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nute; the first was espoused by all the Danes settled in England, while the English declared for Hardicnute as the son of Emma. The contention was carried on with such heat, that a civil war had well nigh been the consequence: but, at last it was terminated by an agreement, importing that the country to<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

Harold perceiving that this noble∣man acted with unbounded authority and influence, as administrator of his bro∣ther's kingdom, resolved to bring him over to his interest; and succeeded in the attempt by means which are easily conceived, when we know that Harold had seized all his father's treasure.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>Goodwin, being thus engaged in his cause, managed his talents for intrigue with such address among the West Saxons, that they looked upon them∣selves as neglected by Hardicnute, and began to turn their eyes upon his bro∣ther Harold. Emma, being informed of these transactions, and finding herself incapable of supporting the interest of Hardicnute, had recourse to dissimula∣tion, and affected to withdraw herself intirely from worldly affairs, visiting churches and monasteries, and employing all her time in exercises of de∣votion. By this conduct, she thought she had effectually lulled the suspicion of Goodwin, who, though he still governed the kingdom, in the name of Har∣dicnute, employed all his arts in private to strengthen the interest of Harold. Her design was to bring over the sons of Ethelred from Normandy, on pre∣tence of a visit to their mother, in hope that the affection of the English would by their presence be revived in favour of the race of Cerdic. When she expressed a desire of seeing her children, Goodwin immediately perceived her drift, and gladly consented to gratify her intention, with a view to recommend himself still more strongly to Harold by the murder of those princes. Emma, who little dreamed of any such inhuman design, wrote a letter of invitation to her sons, whom she encouraged with the hope of recovering their inheritance; and they accordingly arrived with a train of a thousand Normans.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The hearts of the English were warmed by the appearance of those princes, descended from their own glorious monarchs, whose memory they held in the utmost veneration; and they received them with such cordiality as alarmed the traitor Goodwin, who therefore hastened the execution of his treacherous design. He had seemingly been the most eager of all the noblemen in doing honour to the sons of Emma; but that princess, whose maternal fondness rendered her wary and circumspect, never allowed them to visit together, but still retained
<PB N="189" REF="1980"/>
the one under her own eye, while the other was entertained by the noblemen in the country. Goodwin, finding it impracticable to entangle them both at once in his snare, resolved to perpetrate his treason upon Alfred the eldest, whom he arrested with all his followers in the castle of Guilford, by virtue of Ha∣rold's order. Upon this occasion he is said to have tampered with the prince, by offering him his interest, on condition he would marry his daughter; and that Alfred having rejected the proposal with some expressions of disdain, he was so in∣censed at the affrent, that he ordered the unhappy prince's eyes to be put out, and massacred six hundred Normans, by whom he was attended. He then conveyed him to Ely, where he was confined to a monastery, in which he languished for some time in misery and pain, and then expired. Edward being apprized of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> brother's fate, was by the care of his mother sent privately back to Normandy; and Goodwin finding himself hampered in the execution of his schemes, by the presence of this ambitious and intriguing princess, found means to impeach and convict her of treasonable practices against the state; so that she was banished from the kingdom, and took refuge with Baldwin earl of Flanders, who gene∣rously assigned the city of Bruges for her abode and subsistence.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Goodwin, being now absolute master in the kingdom of Wessex, and Hardicnute still delaying his departure from Denmark, that infamous mi∣nister surrendered his power into the hands of Harold, who was proclaimed and crowned king of all England. This prince, who was surnamed Harefoot from his agility, no sooner mounted the throne than he laid a tax upon the peo∣ple for the equipment of a navy to prevent invasions; and in all probability this imposition would not have produced so much discontent, had it not been in∣tended to prevent the success of Edward, whom the English considered as the true heir to the crown. Not but that the son of Edmund residing in Hungary had the advantage over him in proximity of blood, yet he was at too great a distance to have any correspondence or party in the kingdom; and indeed the English would have elected any prince of the most slender pretensions, rather than be governed by Harold, whose brutal character they detested, and whose authority was founded intirely on the interest of Goodwin and his associates. Normandy was too much divided during the minority of William to afford any considerable succours to Edward, whose genius was by no means enterprizing; and therefore the English had recourse to Hardicnute, their countryman by birth, whom they conjured to come and take possession of the throne, promising to support his claim with their lives and fortunes. That prince seemed at length to wake from his lethargy, and fitting out a fleet of sixty ships, set sail on pre∣tence of visiting his mother at Bruges, where while he resided, he was blessed with the news of Harold's death. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl.

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Danes as well as English unanimously joined in making a tender of the crown to Hardicnute, who, at his arrival in England, was re∣ceived with the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, and earl Goodwin dis∣tinguished himself as the first nobleman who did him homage. The ceremony of his coronation was scarce performed, when, impatient to give his mother a con∣vincing proof of the detestation in which he held his brother Harold, by whose order her son Alfred had been destroyed, he ordered the body of the deceased king to be dug up, decapitated, and thrown into the Thames, where it was found by some fishermen, and privately interred in the church-yard of St. Clements,
<PB N="190" REF="1990"/>
which was the Danish burying-ground. Hardicnute's next act of sovereignty was the imposition of a grievous tax for the payment of his navy, which was the more intolerable as the nation was threatened with a famine. This measure pro∣duced universal murmurs through the whole kingdom; and the inhabitants of Worcester raised an insurrection, in which two of the collectors lost their lives. The king, being informed of this outrage, ordered Goodwin duke of Wessex, Leoffric duke of Mercia, and Siward count of Northumberland, to assemble a body of forces, and revenge the insult, by destroying the town, and extermi∣nating<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Dunelm.</NOTE> the inhabitants; an order which was literally obeyed. These were marks of a cruel disposition; though it must be owned that Hardicnute was a pious son and an affectionate brother to Edward, whom he invited to his court, and entertained with the most cordial hospitality. It was also at this juncture that he celebrated the nuptials of his sister and Henry III. emperor of Germany, with incredible magnificence; though that lady found herself extremely unhappy, from the jealousy of her husband, and afterwards obtained a divorce.</P>

<P>By this time the Norman interest triumphed at the English court, in the presence of Edward and the interest of Emma, who had not yet for∣got the tragical death of her eldest son. It was doubtless with a view to gratify her resentment, and pay court to Edward, who would in all proba∣bility one day mount the throne, that Alfric archbishop of York accused Good∣win of being an accomplice in the murder of prince Alfred; and Edward de∣manded justice accordingly. Goodwin found means to evade the danger of this impeachment, by appealing to the avarice of the king, whom he presented with a magnificent galley curiously carved and gilded, and manned with eighty sol∣diers cased in rich armour, with magnificent swords and lances, and each of them a golden bracelet, weighing sixteen ounces, on his arm. By virtue of this present, he was permitted to purge himself by oath, and readily swore he had no<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.

<P>Hardicnute did not long enjoy the crown, which indeed he was unworthy to wear. He was a slave to all his passions, and particularly addicted to feasting and drinking, which he indulged to beaftly excess. These debauches at last cost him<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>41.</NOTE> his life; for he died suddenly in consequence of over-eating himself at the wedding of a Danish lord, celebrated at Lambeth; and his death, far from be∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>Edward, who chanced to be in England at the time of Hardicnute's death, was advised by his friends to have recourse to the assistance of Goodwin, who alone was able to support or defeat his pretensions. By this time indeed, Goodwin had engrossed such power and influence in the kingdom, as no sub∣ject had ever possessed. Besides the dignities of duke of Wessex, earl of Kent, and high treasurer, vested in his own person, his eldest son enjoyed the govern∣ments of Oxfordshire and Herefordshire; and his great wealth, interest, and al∣liances, had rendered him more than a match for any faction that could be raised to oppose his designs. It was therefore a salutary advice, in pursuance of which, Edward, who a few months before had prosecuted him for the murder of his brother, now sollicited his interest in the most humble supplications, and promised to be entirely ruled by his directions. Upon these terms Goodwin espoused his cause; and after having obtained his promise that he would marry
<PB N="191" REF="2000"/>
his daughter Egitha, employed his interest so effectually in his behalf, that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1043.</NOTE> was proclaimed king of England, and crowned by Edsi, archbishop of Canter∣bury. What facilitated this event, was the national hatred between the English<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig. Hoveden.</NOTE> and Danes, which at this time was increased to an implacable degree of rancour, by the insolence of Hardicnute's followers, who had committed such outrages of all sorts, that the people were no sooner apprised of the king's death, than they took to their arms, and butchered or expelled all the Danes who had ac∣companied him to England. Goodwin seized this favourable opportunity of con∣voking an assembly of the states, in which with an eloquence peculiar to himself, he expatiated upon the miseries which that people had entailed upon the nation; and when their minds were properly warmed, he presented Edward, as a descen∣dant of their antient kings, whose claim would be supported by the whole power of Normandy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul.

<P>His remonstrances had the desired effect, and united all the suffrages in favour of Edward, surnamed the Confessor, a prince of very mean parts, who had neither capacity to rule, nor resolution to maintain his authority. His con∣tinual attachment to trifles, his want of discernment, and timorous disposition, enabled his officers and domestics to impose upon his weakness, and encouraged the governors of provinces to render themselves absolute and independent. Earl Goodwin in particular, gradually usurped such a share of power and autho∣rity, that he was more considered than the king himself; and no doubt, the narrowness of the king's genius was one of the concurring motives which in∣duced him to support his claim; because he knew his own credit would rise in proportion to the incapacity of Edward, under whose name he accordingly ma∣naged the whole kingdom. Not but that he hated Goodwin in his heart, both as the murderer of his brother, and the controuler of his own authority; and this doubtless was the cause of his aversion to the accomplished Egitha, whom he delayed to wed, under various pretences, until he durst no longer defer the performance of his promise, lest he should incur the resentment of her father; and even after the nuptials were solemnized, he never consummated the mar∣riage. As he had not courage enough to avow his sentiments, he affected to<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmesb.</NOTE> heap favours on his father-in-law; and this impolitic dissimulation increased the power and credit of Goodwin, by convincing the people that he was beloved by his sovereign.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward, notwithstanding his titles of Saint and Confessor, which he acquired by his attention to the formalities of religion, was a stranger to the christian virtues of charity and forgiveness, as well as to that natural affection which usually springs from the ties of blood. He had entertained a grudge against his mother, since the day she espoused her second husband; and all the efforts she made in the sequel to raise him to the throne, and screen him from the practices of his enemies, had not been able to destroy the impression, or even conquer his desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of revenge, which he now resolved to gratify. With∣out paying the least regard to her quality he repaired to Winchester, where she resided, and, stripping her of all her treasures and effects, left her nothing but a very moderate pension for her subsistence; so that, in her old age, this daughter of a prince, and widow of two great kings, was reduced to extreme poverty, by the cruelty of her own son. Edward was not yet satisfied with the unnatural<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>set.</NOTE> vengeance he had taken; but afterwards is said to have ordered her to be tried,
<PB N="192" REF="2010"/>
for having carried on a scandalous commerce with Alwin, bishop of Winches∣ter. Robert the Norman, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, was her accu∣fer; and as he could not prove his allegations by evidence, he insisted upon her proving her innocence by undergoing the fiery ordeal. She accordingly walked blindfold, over twelve burning plowshares, without being hurt, to the astonish∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of a multitude of spectators.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the midst of these laudable avocations, Edward was alarmed with an account of mighty preparations making by Swein, king of Norway and Denmark, to assert his title to the crown of England, in right of his father Canute. The country was immediately put in a posture of defence, by the care of earl Goodwin, assisted with the endeavours of Leoffric, duke of Mercia, and Siward, earl of Northumberland; and Gunilda, niece of Canute the Great, was obliged to abandon her family and leave the kingdom, lest she should hatch some conspiracy in favour of her countrymen. But, this cloud was dispelled by a war that broke out between Swein and Magnus, son of Anlaf, late king of Norway; in consequence of which rupture Swein's armament was otherwise<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. m. Dunelm.</NOTE> employed. Magnus not only recovered the crown of his father, now known by the name of St. Olave, but afterwards invaded Denmark; so that Swein was fain to sollicit the king of England for succour. Goodwin advised Ed∣ward to send fifty ships to his assistance; but this proposal was so warmly opposed in council by Leoffric and Siward, that no step was taken in favour of Swein, who was driven from his kingdom, though he recovered his throne after the death of his enemy. The troubles of Denmark, however, did not hinder the pyrates of that country from infesting the English coasts. A body of these adventurers arrived at Sandwich, in five and twenty vessels, and ravaged the country, from whence they not only carried off the plunder, which they found, but even the people themselves, whom they sold as slaves in foreign markets. They after∣wards cruised upon the coast of Essex, pillaging the country, and spreading ter∣ror and consternation wheresoever they moved, until earl Goodwin, and the other two noblemen above-mentioned, assembled a body of forces, and repulsed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h 1046.</NOTE> them to their ships with great consternation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>These enemies had no sooner disappeared, than another adventurer alarmed the coast. This was no other than Goodwin's son Swein, who had been obliged to leave the kingdom for having carried off an abbess, of whom he was enamoured. He had retired to Denmark, in full confidence of obtaining his pardon, through the intercession of his father; but whether Good∣win was willing that his son should suffer for the offence he had committed, or the king was inexorable with regard to an outrage offered to religion, the young count found himself disappointed in his expectation; and resolved to be reveng∣ed on his country for the inflexibility of the king. With this view he equip∣ed eight vessels, and committed depredations on the English merchants and the coasts of the kingdom, which he plundered and burned without mercy. Good∣win fearing that these violences might incense the king against him and his fa∣mily, and furnish a handle to his enemies, prevailed upon count Beorn, son of Ulphon, by Estritha, sister to Canute the Great, to employ his good offices with Edward, in favour of his rebellious son; and that nobleman obtained his pardon, upon certain conditions. Then he repaired to Swein, in order to make him acquainted with the success of his negociation, and persuade him to submit
<PB N="193" REF="2020"/>
to the king's pleasure; when that brutal pyrate, supposing the count's intention was to betray him into the hands of justice, slew his benefactor with his own hand, and ordered his body to be thrown into the sea. This barbarous murder retarded the accommodation; but the king afterwards pardoned this ruffian, not∣withstanding the complication of his crimes; so much was he afraid of incurring the displeasure of Goodwin. Indeed there was another reason which concurred with this motive for taking off the outlawry of Swein at this juncture: another fleet of Danish freebooters had arrived on the coast, and were actually joined by the traitor's squadron; which reinforcement rendered them so formidable to England, that it was no wonder Edward used this expedient for weakening their power. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rog. de Hov.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>No part of Edward's conduct gave more offence to the English no∣blemen, than his partiality in favour of the natives and customs of Normandy, where he had been educated. The Norman language became so fashionable at his court, that it was spoke by every person who studied to insinuate himself into the king's good graces. The government of several important fortresses, and many posts of great honour and advantage, were bestowed on those foreign∣ers; and some of their ecclesiastics were preferred to English bishoprics. Among these was Robert, a monk of Jumieges, first elected bishop of London, and then translated to the see of Canterbury. This prelate, with some learning, possessed a great fund of cunning and insinuation, by which he gained an ascen∣dancy over Edward, and counterballanced the credit of Goodwin, who loudly complained of being misrepresented to the king by the meddling priest, and re∣solved with the first opportunity to deprive his majesty of such an officious coun∣sellor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> In a word, those two courtiers hated one another with the utmost ran∣cour, and each in secret projected plans for the destruction of his rival; when an accident happened which reduced the earl to the brink of ruin, and furnish∣ed the king with an opportunity of manifesting his hatred to that insolent no∣bleman.</P>

<P>Eustace, count of Boulogne, who had married Edward's sister Go∣da,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1051.</NOTE> arrived in England to visit his brother-in-law, who received him with great honour and affection; and having tarried some days at his court, set out for Dover in his return to France. A servant, whom he had dispatched before him to bespeak lodgings in that city, happened to quarrel with the townsmen, and a fray ensued, in which he lost his life. The count and his attendants attempting to revenge his death, the inhabitants took arms; and both sides engaging with great fury, Eustace and his retinue were obliged to retire, after having lost about twenty of their number, and slain an equal number of the English. The count, exasperated at this insult, returned to the court at Gloucester, and demanded justice of the king, who forthwith ordered Goodwin, in whose government the tumult had happened, to march with a body of troops, and chastise the offenders with fire and sword.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The earl, thinking he had now found an opportunity of recom∣mending himself to the English nation, and of being revenged on the Norman archbishop at the same time, flatly refused to obey the king's command; ob∣serving that the English subjects were not used to be condemned unheard; and that the equitable way of terminating this affair would be a legal trial, in con∣sequence of which the guilty might be punished by law: that, as earl of Kent, it
<PB N="194" REF="2030"/>
was his duty to protect the people whom he was ordered to punish; and that the resistance they had made was in their own defence, against an insolent fo∣reigner, who ought to be surrendered to justice, and suffer for the mischief he had done. Edward, though shocked at this audacious remonstrance, dissembled his wrath, because he wanted the sinews of vengeance: the archbishop and his Norman friends did not fail to blow the flame of his resentment; but they were in no condition to support him against the power and interest of Goodwin, should he come to an open rupture with that nobleman. He therefore dispatch∣ed em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssaries, in whom he could confide, to duke Leoffric and count Siward, to inform them of Goodwin's insolence, and desire their immediate presence and assistance, to humble the pride and presumption of that dangerous subject, who dared to brave the royal authority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>This step was not taken so secretly, but that it reached the ears of Goodwin, who resolved to be beforehand with the king; and with the assistance of his sons raised a strong body of forces, on pretence of marching against the Welsh, who had erected a petty fort on the frontiers of Herefordshire. Having thus anticipated Edward, he pulled off the mask, and sent deputies to that prince, demanding that he would without delay deliver up Eustace, and his at∣tendants, to justice, and expel all the Normans from the kingdom; otherwise he would prosecute him with all the rigour of war. Edward, by this time, back∣ed by the Mercian and Northumbrian forces, made a suitable reply to this trea∣sonable declaration; and a civil war must have been the consequence, had not Siward and Leoffric prevented matters from being brought to extremity, and set on foot a negociation, by which it was agreed that the disputes should be ju∣dicially determined before the assembly of the states at London. Mean while Ed∣ward's army was reinforced from different quarters by all the nobility who hated Goodwin; and at the appointed time the earl's two sons marched to Southwark with a numerous body of West-Saxons; but their men deserting continually, they retired before the determination of their cause, and Goodwin and his five sons were condemned to banishment.</P>

<P>The earl himself, with Swein and Toston, retired to Flanders, while Harold and Leofwin took refuge in Ireland; and Edward, in order to satiate his revenge upon the whole family, not only bestowed their honours and employ∣ments upon other noblemen, but also confined the queen in the monastery of Warewell, after having stripped her of all her jewels and effects. Goodwin and his sons did not tamely bear their exile and disgrace; but finding means to equip a good number of ships at Bruges as well as in Ireland, their squadrons joined near Portland, and, sailing along shore, were reinforced all the way by soldiers from the country, and ships from the Cinque-ports, until entering the Thames, they advanced to London, where the king was provided with a strong fleet and army for their reception.</P>

<P>But both sides consisting of English, they were unwilling to imbrue their hands in the blood of their countrymen; and the bishops and nobility again interposing, effected an accommodation. Goodwin and his sons obliged themselves to give hostages, to be kept in Normandy as pledges for their good behaviour, in consideration of being restored to their honours and estates; and the king consented that a l foreigners should be expelled the kingdom. To this article Edward assented with great reluctance, at the press∣ing
<PB N="195" REF="2040"/>
intreaties of Stigand, bishop of Winchester, who, in a very little time, reap∣ed the happy fruits of his success: for, immediately after this agreement, Ro∣bert, archbishop of Canterbury, retired to Normandy; and, being banished by a sentence of the general assembly of the states, as an incendiary and principal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1052.</NOTE> cause of the late troubles, Stigand was promoted to his see. The queen was honourably released from her confinement: Goodwin was formally impeached by the king for the murder of his brother Alfred, and acquitted; his family were restor∣ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb.

Swein, however, the most profligate libertine of his age, in order to expiate his guilt in the treacherous murder of his kinsman Beorn, undertook the voluntary pe∣nance of going barefoot as a pilgrim to the holy land, and was slain in his re∣turn by the Saracens.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The tranquillity of England being restored by this reconciliation, the king was visited by William the Bastard, duke of Normandy; during whose residence at the English court, Edward took all opportunities of manifesting his gratitude for the favours and protection he owed to that prince in his adversity. It must have been at this juncture, that he made his will in favour of William, if any such deed ever existed; for it cannot be supposed to have been made during<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1053.</NOTE> his residence in the Norman court, while his elder brother Alfred was alive, and the throne of England occupied, so that he must have had a very faint prospect of succeeding to the crown; it is not at all unlikely that Edward, who had no issue of his own, and very little affection for Edgar Atheling, the grandson of Edmund <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ronside, and who in his heart detested Goodwin, should bequeath his throne to an active prince, his friend and kinsman, who would prevent its falling a prey to the exorbitant power of that haughty nobleman; yet no such will was ever produced, although William made it a pretence for seizing the English crown.</P>

<P>Goodwin's power increased every day to such a degree that his arro∣gance became quite insupportable, and the more grievous to Edward, as he had found means to banish from court every person in whom that weak prince reposed the least confidence. This tyranny however at last expired with the life of that im∣perious nobleman, who was suddenly deprived of the faculty of speech as he sat at dinner with the king at the palace of Oldiham, and being carried into an apartment of the palace, died in three days, during which he continued speechless and insen∣sible. This was probably no other than an apoplectic fit, the effect of age and infir∣mity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig.</NOTE> tho' the monkish writers imputed it to the judgment of heaven, affirming that the king having dropped some hint of suspicion against the earl as an ac∣complice in the murder of Alfred, Goodwin exclaimed, "May this morsel be<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Thus, though Goodwin was no more, his power, interest, credit, and connexions, still survived in the person of Harold, who was not so proud, insolent, and haughty, as his father, and behaved to the king with appearance of respect and submission. By this conduct he hoped to efface the impressions of hatred, which the king preserved against his family: but, nothing could conciliate the affection of Ed∣ward,
<PB N="196" REF="2050"/>
who detested the son as much as he had ever hated the father, and dreaded him more, because Harold had made himself more popular by his honest deal∣ing and affability; for the same reason the king still wore the mask of dissimulation.</P>

<P>Timorous as this prince was in his disposition, he found him∣self so far happy, that his dominions were not exposed to the calamities of war, though he was not a little alarmed about this period, by Macbeth, usurper of the Scotish crown, who threatened to invade Cumberland. That bloody tyrant had murdered his lawful king Duncan, who had loaded him with favours, and now wanted to destroy that prince's son Malcolm Canmore, who possessed Cumber∣land, as eldest son and he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r apparent of the king of Scotland. Macbeth having rendered himself odious to his subjects by his cruelty and oppression, the greatest part of the nobility sollicited Malcolm in secret, to mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> against the usurper, and promised to declare for him as soon as he should cross the borders of the kingdom. This young prince had recourse to Edward, who supplied him with a strong body of forces, commanded by Siward earl of Northumberland; and they advanced against the us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rper, who gave them battle, and was defeated after a very desperate engagement, in which Osborn the son of Siward lost his life. When the count understood that he was slain, he asked if his wounds were before, and being answered in the affirmative, "Well then (said he) I can give him a soldier's burial." Macbeth after this action retired to the highlands, where he was deserted by his subjects, and at last taken and slain; so that Mal∣colm<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Siward did not long survive this glorious expedition; he was that year seized with a distemper at York, which reduced him to the grave.

<P>His government was bestowed upon Harold's brother Toston, by which the family of Goodwin gained a great accession of power; though Harold, not yet satisfied with his good fortune, projected the ruin of his own brother-in-law Alfgar, because he resented the king's conferring upon that no∣blemen the offices which he had formerly possessed.

He retired into Ireland, where he found means to raise a body of forces, which he transported into Wales, where he was joined by Griffith prince of that country; and these associates making an irruption into Herefordshire, defeated Raoul de Mantes, governor of that county: but they were afterwards routed by Harold, who of his own accord had assembled his vassals to check their progress.

<P>Harold's behaviour in this expedition, added to his insinuating manners, extended and increased his popularity to such a degree, that the peo∣ple began already to talk of him as the most proper person to succeed the king upon the throne of England.

Edgar Atheling, and his daughters Margaret and Christina. The appearance of a son of their beloved Edmund Ironside, detached the English intirely from the interest of Harold, and united all their affection in favour of their own royal line; but prince Edward died soon after his arrival, leaving his pretensions to his son Edgar, who was too young, weak, and inactive, to avail himself of his title. The same year was distinguished by the death of Leoffric duke of Mercia, who was a nobleman possessed of many excellent qualities <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">No lady of the age was more celebrated for her beauty and virtue, than this nobleman's wise Godina, of whom it is reported, that in order to redeem the inhabitants of Coventry from a tax imposed by her husband, she under∣took to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e naked through the city; such be∣ing the condition of their exemption, stipulated by the caprice of her lord.

<P>Whether this nobleman was desirous of engaging William duke of Normandy in his interest, not knowing the private agreement between king Edward and that duke; or he wanted to effect the release of his brother Ulnoth and his nephew Hacun, who had been delivered as hostages for his father's good behaviour, and sent into Normandy, where they still resided; he resolved to make a voyage to the continent, and asked the king's permission to sollicit the duke in person for the liberty of his relations, whom, as Edward pretended, he had refused to release. The king, though incessantly importuned on this sub∣ject, lent a deaf ear to his intreaties, because he was afraid that Harold would in a personal interview with William, discover the agreement he had made with that prince, relating to the succession, and embroil him with his own subjects at his return. Harold, finding the king inflexible, resolved to take that liberty which Edward would not grant, and embarked for Rouen, without giving the king the least intimation of his design; but he was driven by stress of weather into one of the ports of Picardy, and immediately arrested by order of the count de Ponthieu. In this emergency he wrote an account of his misfortunes to Wil∣liam duke of Normandy, who demanded him from the count in such a peremp∣tory manner, that he was set at liberty, and proceeded to Rouen, where he was received with great hospitality; tho' the duke resolved to make his advantage of this visit. He took occasion to communicate to Harold his designs upon the crown of England, and the secret contract between Edward and him upon that subject; and as he was not ignorant of Harold's views, gave him to understand that he expected he would resign his pretensions. The earl, who had never suspected any such collusion between the king and the duke, finding himself in the power of the latter, thought proper to dissemble his sentiments; and after having owned with an appearance of candour, that he had once entertained such views before the arrival of prince Edward from Hungary, now faithfully promised to contribute h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s whole interest in behalf of William, whose daughter he demanded in mar∣riage,
<PB N="198" REF="2070"/>
as a proof of his attachment. The duke was extremely well pleased with his frank manner of deportment, though he obliged him to confirm his promise by oath, in presence of the states of Normandy and some holy relics, by which he imagined the obligation was rendered inviolable: then he was betrothed to William's daughter, who was too young for the consummation of marriage, and they parted to all appearance extremely well satisfied with one another.</P>
<P>He no sooner returned to England, however, than he forgot his oath, and redoubled his endeavours to baffle the designs of William, by taking all opportunities of increasing the national prejudice against the Normans; of strengthening his own party among the nobles; and of recommending him∣self more and more to the favour and affection of the people: while Edward, who plainly perceived his aim, took no pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns to counteract his projects, having<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dun <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> no connexions that he valued above his own peace and tranquillity, which he determined if possible to preserve.</P>

<P>Immediately after this transaction, Harold had occasion to for∣tify himself in the esteem of the English, by repelling the Welsh, who had re∣newed hostilities under their prince Griffith, and rendering them tributary to the crown of England. Nevertheless they seized the first opportunity of repeat∣ing their incursions; and after having ravaged the country, retired with their booty to mountains and fastnesses, which they deemed inaccessible to heavy arm∣ed soldiers. Harold, seeing no end to these depredations, but in the destruction of the whole race, marched against them with a body of light-armed troops, which pursued them among their hills and ferretted them out of their retreats, while his cavalry scoured the plain country; so that the enemy finding themselves in danger of being utterly exterminated, slew their gallant prince Griffith, and sent his head to Harold, as a token of their submission: upon which they were forgiven, and acknowledged the authority of Blethyh and Raywallon, whom Ed∣ward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Sim.

<P>Nor was Harold's equity and moderation less conspicuous than his martia accomplishments.

<P>While Harold, in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is manner, took long strides towards the succession, Edward's attention was engrossed by the dedication of the cathedral at Westminster, which, together with an adjoining monastery, he built in the place where an old church had stood, that was founded by king Sabert, or ra∣ther converted into a Christian church, from a temple in which the old Saxons had worshipped Apollo. That this ceremony might be performed in the most solemn manner, he convoked a general assembly of the states at London; and was taken dangerously ill before they were dismissed. He had made a vow to go on a pilgrimage to Rome; but as he afterwards found it inconvenient as well as disagreeable to his subjects to leave the kingdom, he obtained a dispensation from the pope, absolving him from this obligation; but he thought he could not employ the money he had raised for his journey to a better purpose than that of building the cathedral and monastery of Westminster, to which he granted, by charter, the privilege of a sanctuary and other valuable exemptions, which were confirmed by the assembly of the states; and the church was consecrated to St. Peter. This was the last transaction of Edward, whose indisposition had greatly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulphus.</NOTE> increased before the consecration was finished; he then was confined to his bed, and lay in a delirium for three days, at the expiration of which, he recovered the use of his reason; recommended his queen as a virgin to the good offices of the nobility; desired some provision might be made for the servants who had followed him from Normandy; and directed that his body should be buried in the new church of Westminster: then receiving the sacrament, he resigned his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

<P>Thus died Edward, whose mental qualities did not at all answer to the dignity of his person. He was weak, indolent, and irresolute, and the attach∣ment to his own ease tended in a great measure to the tranquillity of his reign; for had he been active in his resentment, the nation must have been exposed to the calamities of a civil war, from the measures he would have taken to gratify his hatred towards Goodwin and his family. He seems to have been void of natural af∣fection, and indeed of every other passion that kindles any warm emotion in the human heart. He was equally free of pride and ostentation, moderate in his appe∣tites, complacent in his deportment, charitable to the poor, and extremely punc∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in the performance of all religious duties: so that he acquired among the vul∣gar the title of Saint and Confessor, by which epithet he was afterwards canonized. His continence, so much extolled by the monkish writers, seems to have been the effect of constitutional frigidity. His prophecies and revelations are no other than the dreams of superstition; and as for his curing scrophulous tumours and ulcers by the touch, the sensible part of mankind is by this time very well convinced that neither he who exercised this apostolical function, in imitation of the French kings, nor any of his successors, ever contributed to the recovery of one patient, by any inherent personal virtue derived from heaven. The passive humanity, or rather easiness of his disposition, appears from some private incidents
<PB N="200" REF="2090"/>
of his life, which are very often more characteristic, than those transactions of importance, which are the effects of counsel and deliberation. One day, while he reposed himself upon a couch, a page who little dreamed that he was in the apartment, finding an iron chest open, filled his pockets with the silver it con∣tained; but, not satisfied with his first booty, he had recour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to it again, when the king thinking him perhaps too unconscionable, "Boy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>said he very deli∣berately) you had better be satisfied with what you have got; for if Hugolin, my chamberlain, should come in, you will lose the whole, and be severely whipt into the bargain." Another day being at the chace, in which he delighted, a forward peasant crossed the hounds and spoiled his diversion; upon which he rode up to the clown in a great passion, exclaiming, "By God's mother! fellow, I would be revenged on thee, were it in my power."

There is great disagreement among the authors who have writ the history of this period, touching the manner in which Harold ascended the throne. Some alledge that the citizens of London, with Harold at their head, visited Edward in his last moments, and extorted his nomination of this earl, even after he declared that he had already appointed William, duke of Normandy, for his successor; and others affirm, that after Edward's death, finding there was a dispute among the nobles about the succession, he seized the crown, which he placed upon his own head, and intimi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated the assembly to such a degree, that they gave their suffrages unanimously in his favour.</P>

He paid great de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence to the clergy, without shutting his eyes to the irregularities of that order, severely chastising the guilty, while he bestowed marks of his favour upon the innocent, by confirming their charters, and extending their immunities.

with some ships by his father-in-law the count of Flanders, landed in the Isle of Wight, which he laid under contribution. Then he pillaged the coast until he arrived in Lincolnshire, where he was encountered by Edwin and Morcar, who routed his troops, and obliged him to take refuge in Scotland, in hope of being joined by Harold Harfager, king of Norway, whom William, duke of Normandy, had instigated to ravage the English coast, and keep the king in play, until he should have completed the armament which he was then prepar∣ing to assert his title to the English crown.</P>

<P>The duke of Normandy, though well informed of all these po∣pular transactions of Harold, would not desist from the enterprize he had pro∣jected, but carried on his preparations with unremitting vigour, and in the mean time, to give some colour of justice to his attempt, he sent ambassadors to demand that Harold would relinquish the crown in his favour, and to denounce war in case of a refusal. To this peremptory demand Harold replied, that William had no sort of right to the crown of England; for, granting that the late king had disposed of it in his favour, such a disposition (if any such there was) could not take place, inasmuch as it was diametrically opposite to the laws of the kingdom, which restricted kings from bestowing their crowns according to their own caprice, especially to strangers. With respect to himself, he had been fairly elected by those who had a right to confer the sovereignty; nor could he yield the crown to any other, without betraying the confidence reposed in him by his subjects. As to the oath, which he accused him of having vio∣lated, it was extorted from him by compulsion, while he was in the power of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he duke; and therefore null and void, according to the law of nations. Finally, he gave him to understand, that he knew how to defend his right against any person by whom he should be invaded.

<P>Duke William, in order to raise the sums necessary for defraying the expence of such an important enterprize, convoked an assembly of the Norman states, of whom he demanded subsidies. But they flatly refused to comply with his proposals, on pretence that Normandy was already exhausted of men and money by the late wars; and that they were not obliged to serve in fo∣reign expeditions, in which the interest of Normandy was not immediately con∣cerned. William, disappointed in this quarter, was advised to borrow money of particular persons; and this method succeeded beyond his wish. The indivi∣duals among the noblemen and merchants seemed to vye with each other in con∣tributing towards the armament; and among others, William Fitzosberne un∣dertook to equip forty vessels at his own expence. At the same time he had re∣course to some of the neighbouring princes, who advanced money on the con∣tingency of having lands assigned to them, at the conquest of England; and in order to give the greater sanction to his undertaking, he obtained the approba∣tion of the pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by promising to hold the kingdom as a fief of the holy see. That pontiff not only provided him with a consecrated standard; but also issued a bull, excommunicating all those who should attempt to interrupt the duke in the execution of his design.

<P>It was at this juncture that the politic Norman engaged the king of Norway to make a diversion in his favour, by invading the north of England. Accordingly Harfager arrived with a fleet of two hundred sail at the mouth of the Humber, where he was reinforced by Toston, and sailing up the river<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id waste the country of Yorkshire. The earls of Mercia and Northumberland assembled a body of raw undisciplined troops to oppose their progress; but they were routed at Fulford, and York fell a prey to the enemy! Mean while Harold being apprised of Harfager's descent, began his march at the head of a royal army to check the career of the invaders; and the two ar∣mies meeting near Standford bridge, since known by the name of Battle-bridge, a furious engagement ensued, in which Harfager and Toston were killed, and almost all their forces cut in pieces. Those who escaped, owed their safety to the personal prowess of a brave Norwegian, who singly defended a bridge over the Derwent, for three hours, against the whole English army, during which time he slew forty of their best men with his battle ax, until he was slain by an arrow. Harold pursuing his victory, made himself master of a great many<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The fame of this victory did not contribute so much to the confidence which his subjects reposed in his valour and capacity, as his unseasonable parsimony hurt him in the opinion of his army: for he reserved to himself the whole booty, which was very considerable, with a view to convert it to the maintenance of the war against the Norman: and though this was a laudable design, formed in fa∣vour of his subjects, whom he was loth to burthen, it produced great dissatisfac∣tion among his troops, a great number of whom deserted the service.</P>

who had seized the crown to which he had no right, in direct violation of the oath he had sworn at the Norman court. But, he made not the least mention of Edward's will, which might have had some small weight among the people; whereas the reasons he assigned were so frivolous, that no Englishman would enlist under his banner.

<P>Harold was at York when he received the news of this invasion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and forthwith began his march for London, where, upon reviewing his army, he found it very much diminished by the battle with the Norwegians, and the sub∣sequent desertion: but, all the nobility had assembled about his person, to of∣fer their services on such an interesting occasion. While he remained in this city, waiting for some troops that were on the march to join him from diffe∣rent parts of the country, William sent ambassadors to him with another inso∣lent message, demanding he would surrender the crown which he had so persi∣diously usurped; and Harold retorted his arrogance by another embassy of the same nature, to which the duke made no answer. The English monarch hav∣ing assembled all his forces, advanced against the Norman army, and encamp∣ed within seven miles of Hastings, where they were posted. While they re∣mained at such a small distance from each other, on the eve of a decisive battle, the spies of Harold brought such a report of the strength and discipline of the Normans, that the principal officers of the English army began to doubt of their success. And Harold's brother Gurth advised the king to defer the battle; repre∣senting that the Normans would be distressed by the delay, and in all probability obliged to leave the kingdom, at the approach of winter; whereas the English army would daily increase: but, if he was determined to risque an engagement, he intreated Harold to retire, that in case the troops should be defeated, he might be in a condition to attack the victors with a fresh body of forces. The king re∣jected this advice with disdain, declaring, he would, by his personal behaviour, convince his subjects he was worthy of the crown they had set upon his head; and affirming that the Normans were not more formidable than the Norwegian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he had so lately conquered.</P>

<P>The duke of Normandy perceiving that Harold was determined to give him battle, advanced a little way, and took post in an advantageous situ∣ation, where he could have room to draw up his army in order of battle; and at this juncture he abated a little of his former pride and ferocity. Conscious of the greatness of that stake which he was going to hazard, he sent a monk to Harold, offering to refer their dispute to the determination of the pope; to quit the kingdom, provided he would do him homage for the crown; or to decide the quarrel in single combat. To these propositions Harold replied, that he was not so simple as to submit to the arbitration of the pope, who had already declared himself a party; that he scorned to hold the crown of England depend∣ent on any prince whatever; nor would he put his kingdom on the issue of a single combat, in which, though he should obtain the victory, he could reap no solid advantage. He therefore told the messenger that God would next day decide between him and his adversary.</P>
<P>That night was spent in feasting and mirth by the English, who seemed con∣sident of success; while the Normans were employed in prayer and preparation
<PB N="204" REF="2130"/>
for the battle. Next day, being the 14th of October, and the anniversary of Harold's birth, both armies appeared fronting each other, in order of battle. The vanguard of the English was composed of Kentishmen, in consequence of a pri∣vilege they enjoyed since the beginning of the Saxon heptarchy; and Harold commanded the main body on foot, as much exposed as the meanest of his soldiers. The Normans were formed in three lines, the first of which was com∣manded by Montgomery and Fitzosberne; Geoffrey Martel conducted the se∣cond; and the duke headed the body of reserve, that he might occasionally sustain those who should need his assistance. The number of the Normans amounted to sixty thousand, including the archers and a strong body of cavalry armed cap-a-pee. The English were not so numerous, and consisted mostly of infantry armed with the target, battle-ax, spear, and scymitar.</P>

<P>The Normans began the battle, advancing while they sung the bal∣lad of Orlando, and letting fly a shower of arrows, which discomposed the English, who were not accustomed to such missiles; nevertheless, they immedi∣ately closed their files, and gave the Normans such a warm reception, that they were obliged to retire a little and take breath. They repeated the attack, but could make no impression upon the English phalanx; and, in a word, the battle was fought with equal valour on both sides, from seven in the morning till the afternoon, before an inch of ground was lost or won on either side, not∣withstanding the various efforts and undaunted courage of both chiefs, who ex∣hibited repeated proofs of martial conduct, and animated their men by their presence, admonition, and example. At length William put in practice a strata∣gem to which his army had been regularly trained; he ordered a retreat to be sounded, and immediately his lines gave way, with such appearance of confu∣sion, that the English believing them routed, forsook their ranks, and pursued with equal impetuosity and disorder. The duke of Normandy seeing their im∣penetrable column broke into small detachments dispersed about the field, or∣dered another signal to be made, at sight of which his men formed again in an instant, and, surrounding the detached bodies of the English, made a terrible slaughter. Harold, enraged to see the victory thus wrested from his grasp, ran about the field with the utmost agility, rallying his men and reduc∣ing them to order, and at length took possession of a rising-ground, where he was joined by such a number of the fugitives, that he soon found himself in a condition to make head against the enemy. The Normans advanced to attack them, and were repulsed. Had Harold taken this opportunity of retiring, he might have saved himself and the greatest part of his army, and, in all pro∣bability, the Norman would have been glad to make peace on equal terms: but, he could not bear the disgrace of leaving the field of battle to his adver∣sary, and resolved to maintain his post till next day, when he would try his fortune in another engagement.</P>

<P>William perceiving the night approaching, and unwilling to leave the battle undecided, made another desperate effort to dislodge the English, and in this attack Harold was shot dead with an arrow that pierced his brain.

Yet a good part of the English ar∣my,
<PB N="205" REF="2140"/>
favoured by the darkness, was saved by the conduct of Morcar and Edwin, who had fought with great courage, until the king and his two brothers were slain; and then seeing the toops broken and dispirited, had yielded to the fortune of the day. In this long and bloody engagement, which decided the fate of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.Ch. 1066.</NOTE> England, the victor lost six thousand men; but a much greater number of the vanquished were slain. William having thus attained the accomplishment of his wish, ordered his whole army to kneel and return thanks to heaven for the victory they had obtained: then he directed a tent to be pitched in the middle of the slain, and there he passed the remaining part of the night. In the morning his soldiers were employed in burying their dead countrymen, while the peasants of the neighbourhood were permitted to perform the same office to the English, who had lost their lives in the battle. Harold's body was so mangled and defaced that it could not be discovered, until a lady, whom he had kept as a mistress, distinguished it by some private mark, known to herself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

Being thus recognized, it was sent, together with the bodies of his bro∣thers Gurth and Lewin, to their mother Githa, by whom they were honoura∣bly interred in the abbey of Waltham, which Harold himself had founded <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">During the battle, which was fought near Heathfield, in Suffex, at a place since called Battel, the duke of Normandy had three horses killed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder him; and was frequently in mani∣fest hazard of his life.

During this reign, however, Withlaf, the tributary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This deed was confirmed by Egbert, and seems to have been the only ecclesiastical transaction of his reign: but his successor Ethelwolf, who was entirely governed by the clergy, and left the administra∣tion to Swithin, bishop of Winchester, extended his complaisance to the church

<P>The reigns of Ethelbald, Ethelbert, and Ethelred I. are very barren of all ecclesiastical matter, except the destruction of monasteries by the Danes, which the historians of those days have described in very pathetic terms; regret∣ting in particular the three famous convents of Croyland, Ely, and Mederhamstede, in which the monks were maffacred and the libraries burned. We have already observed, that the cruelty of the Danes was so inveterate against every person ap∣pertaining to the culture of the christian religion, that those few monks who escaped their barbarity, either quitted the kingdom, or had recourse to other em∣ployments for a livelihood, when they found themselves deprived of the reve∣nues upon which they formerly subsisted; so that Alfred the Great, when he triumphed over those invaders, could find no monks in England, and was obliged to replenish the monasteries he built with ecclesiastics invited from fo∣reign countries. This great prince, who contributed so much to the resto∣ration of learning and religion, enacted ecclesiastical as well as civil institu∣tions. The first part of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese is little more than a transcript of the Deca∣logue, omitting the second commandment, because repugnant to image-wor∣ship, which had by this time gained footing in England.

<P>Among those learned strangers who assisted Alfred in his great work of restoring the lustre of the church, and reviving the arts and sciences, the principal were these: Johannes Scotus Erigena, an Irish Scot, who had studied at Athens, and in other foreign countries, and made himself master of the Greek and oriental tongues. He then repaired through Italy to France, where he acquired an eminent degree of favour and familiarity with Charles the Bald; and the fame of his talents extending to England, he was invited hither by Al∣fred, whom he instructed in the liberal arts, and whose friendship he enjoyed notwithstanding his opposition to the doctrine of transubstantiation, which ren∣dered him obnoxious to the see of Rome. Towards the latter part of his life<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> he opened a scho l in the monastery of Malmesbury, where his scholars mur∣dered him with their penknives, though we are ignorant of the occasion. An∣other foreigner, for whom Alfred conceived a very early affection, was one Grimbald, who entertained him so hospitably in his journey to Rome, that he afterwards created him abbot of Winchester. He was a learned divine, well skilled in music, and distinguished himself for his talents in oratory. The first abbot of the new abbey, founded in the isle of Athelney, was a native of old Saxony, and almost all the monks, priests, and deacons, were foreigners. Not but that his own country produced a number of men, who distinguished them∣selves by their piety and erudition; namely, Asser Menevensis, a monk of St. David's, so attached to his retirement, that all the caresses and favours of Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed could not prevail upon him to forsake it entirely, though he consented to
<PB N="207" REF="2160"/>
live one half year with the king, who promoted him to the bishopric of Sher∣born, and bestowed upon him many other marks of his particular regard: yet, he must not be confounded with his name-sake and uncle Asserius, archbishop of St. David's, who wrote part of Alfred's life. John, the monk, belonging to the same monastery, to whose instruction the king owed his knowledge of the Latin tongue. Werefred, bishop of Worcester, who had been driven by the Danes into banishment, from whence he was recalled by Alfred, who employed him to translate Gregory's dialogues. Plegmund, archbishop of Canterbury, and Dunwulf, bishop of Winchester, who is said by some authors to have been the very cowherd whom Alfred served in disguise: that prince it seems disco∣vered in him a genius far above his station in life, which he exalted in propor∣tion to his merit.</P>

<P>But of all the ecclesiastics who dignified the court of Alfred, Neotus or St. Neot, was the most remarkable for his learning, piety, and example. In being descended from the blood royal of the East-Angles, he was respected as a prince as well as a prelate; and is said, by his personal authority and admonitions, to have restricted the sallies of Alfred's youth. He was bu∣ried at St. Guerer's church, at Gainsbury, in Cornwal; and such, by that time, was the general opinion of his sanctity, that he supplanted the Cornish saint, and gave his own name to the church, which was thenceforward called Neot∣stow. The palace of earl Alric, in Huntingdonshire, was afterwards converted into a monastery, and dedicated to this saint, whose body was translated thither; though not suffered to remain in this place neither; for, in the reign of king John, his bones were removed from this St. Neods, to the abbey of Croyland. This ecclesiastic, and the greatest part of those abovementioned, taught together in the university of Oxford, which was regulated and endowed by Alfred, who frequently assisted in person at their exercises, until some disputes arose between the native and foreign professors, and then Grimbald retired to the monastery at Winchester, which the king had lately founded. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE></P>

<P>Alfred's successor Edward imitated the virtues of his father in found∣ing the university of Cambridge, as well as in a number of benefactions to the church: yet his reign is remarkable for a very particular exertion of the autho∣rity of the Roman see. Pope Formosus, being informed that the bishopric of Wessex had been seven years vacant, sent over a bull, excommunicating the king and all his subjects, which being publicly read at a general assembly of the states, by Plegmund, archbishop of Canterbury, the vacant sees were im∣mediately filled, and three new bishoprics erected in Wessex. Then Pleg∣mund set out for Rome, where the sentence was revoked, and at his return to<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> England he consecrated seven prelates in one day. Plegmund was succeeded in the see of Canturbury by Athelm, bishop of Wells, who crowned Athelstan, at King∣ston upon Thames; and during the reign of this prince was held the synod of Greatly, in which, besides the political constitutions already mentioned, Athel∣stan ordained, that all his own domaines should pay tythes to the church; and a poor Englishman be maintained from the product of every two farms in his possession. After the death of Athelstan, Odo, bishop of Sherburn, was pro∣moted to the see of Canterbury. He was a Dane by extraction, though born in East-Anglia, and disinherited by his parents on account of his attachment to the Christian religion. His sufferings recommended him to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="208" REF="2170"/>
a nobleman called Adhelm, who persuaded him to take orders; and by his in∣terest he was raised to the see of Sherburn. Edmund, the successor of Athelstan, importuned him to accept of the archbishopric of Canterbury, which, however, he for some time refused, from a scruple of conscience, believing that translations were unlawful. When this objection was removed, by producing the example of Miletus and Justus, he was seized with a more ridiculous qualm, suppos∣ing no person but a monk could be qualified for an archbishopric; so that the king was obliged to send commissaries to France, to prevail upon the abbot of Fleury, to admit him into his society. After his elevation this bigotted priest published a body of canons, in which he denounces excom∣munication against all violators of the church's property and exemptions; declares that those who refuse to obey the discipline of the church, are more wicked than the soldiers who crucified Christ; that it is the duty of kings, princes, and other persons in authority, to obey with great humility the arch∣bishops and bishops, who keep the keys of heaven, and possess the power of b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding and loosing; and that all the laity should be scrupulously exact in paying the tythes to the clergy.</P>

<P>In the reign of Edmund, a great synod was convoked at London, in which bishops were enjoined to repair their churches, and the king required to establish funds for their support. In the course of the following year, another assembly enacted constitutions for the advancement of the christian religion, and the maintenance of concord among the people. Here also churches and royal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Cone.</NOTE> palaces were made places of sanctuary; and it was ordained that no mulct for breaking the peace, or satisfaction for murder, should be forgiven. About this period the famous Dunstan began to signalize himself in the church and state. He was by birth a West-Saxon, descended of a noble family, and educated at Glastonbury, under a learned Irish monk, who instructed youth in that monas∣tery. Having made extraordinary progress in his studies, he was recommend∣ed by Adhe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, archbishop of Canterbury, to king Athelstan, who took him under his protection, but no sooner perceived his ambitious views and meddling disposition, than he discarded him from his court. It was then that Dunstan retired in disgust from the world, and conceived that affection for the monks which he so cordially expressed in the whole course of his future grandeur. Ed∣mund, at his accession to the throne, invited him from his retreat, and made him his confessor; but he was for some misdemeanor dismissed from this office, which however he regained by d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of interest, and acquired amazing influence under this monarch and his brother Edred. The monastic life was at the same time dignified by an illustrious member in the person of Turketyl, who was an excellent soldier and sound politician, and quitted the office of chancellor to em∣brace the life of a recluse, at Croyland, of which he was made abbot, after having received the habit, together with the episcopal benediction and pasto∣ral staff. He was no sooner established in this ecclesiastical office, than he resigned the monastery, with all its deeds, to Edred, who afterwards re∣stored them to Turkytel and his monks, in a full assembly of the states at London, when he exempted them from all service and incumbrances, and con∣firmed all the former privileges of the monastery, except that of its being a sanctuary, which the abbot wisely refused.</P>

<P>Dunstan being promoted to the archbishopric of Canterbury, exerted all his power and influence to re-establish the monks in possession of the monaste∣ries which were occupied by the secular clergy; and if Edred had lived a little longer, he would probably have accomplished his aim: but that prince dying before he could wholly execute his project, his successor Edwy frustrated all his endeavours, and not only stripped the monks of their benefices, but also expelled them from the monasteries of Abingdon and Malmesbury. We have already ob∣served how the clamour raised by the monks on this occasion, cost Edwy the best part of his dominions; and mentioned the steps which were taken in the succeeding reign by Dunstan, to expel the secular priests, in their turn, on pre∣tence that they did not lead a life of celibacy, according to the institutions of the councils and see of Rome. Yet, notwithstanding all his credit and eagerness of affection for the monks, it was not in his power to re-establish them in the monasteries of the north, which had been deserted above two hundred years; insomuch that the order was scarce known in the province of Northumberland.</P>

<P>In the reign of Edward a body of canons was composed from the capitularies of Charlemagne, providing for the punctual payment of tythes and Peter-pence, the observation of Sunday, and the punishment of corrupted judges. These were followed by another set, by which it appears that priests took young students to serve a kind of clerkship, before they were admitted to holy orders; for, one of the canons forbids any priest to take a student without the consent of his former tutor. There is another, obliging every priest to learn some occupation, as an handicraftsman: and the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t enjoin all ecclesiastics to learn the creed and pater-noster; to have the host always in readiness, and burn it carefully when it grows stale, so as that the ashes may be put under the altar. There is likewise a prohibition against the marriage of priests; a strong in∣junction upon all christians to abstain from eating blood; and the collection conc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udes with penitentiary canons, by which it appears, that delinquents were allowed either to buy off their penance, or do it by proxy.</P>

<P>Oswald, bishop of Worcester, being preferred to the see of York, invited several foreign monks to settle in England, twelve of whom he sent to Ramsey, in Huntingdonshire, where Alwin, duke of East-Anglia, had founded a religious house; and among other immunities, specified in the charter, that no bishop should demand any entertainment, or exact any contribution from the monks of that society. At the death of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgar, we have seen how the ejected secular clergy renewed their claims under Alfgar, duke of Mercia, who drove the monks from their possessions in his government, while they were supported by another party of the nobility in the interest of Dunstan. In the course of this contest several councils were assembled, at which an Irish bishop called Be∣ornelm, undertook the cause of the secular priests, and offered to dispute in public on the subject: but Dunstan declined the challenge, on pretence that he was old and infirm; and that it would be impious to admit any dispute on a subject, which had been determined by the miraculous interposition of heaven; for, as we have formerly observed, a crucifix was heard to speak in favour of the monks; and now this decision was confirmed by the terrible accident of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Osborne Vit.

<P>Dunstan was succeeded by Ethelgar, originally a monk of Glastonbury; and after him the archbishop's see was occupied by Siricius from the same semi∣nary, who had before been preferred to the see of Ramsbury, in Wiltshire. This is the prelate whose memory is branded for having advised king Ethelred to purchase a peace of the Danes; tho' it must be observed that no part of the Danegelt was le∣vied by the clergy. Under the reign of this prince, a mission was sent from Eng∣land, at the request of Aulaf, king <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Norway, to convert his subjects and the Swedes to the christian religion.

<P>Alfric, archbishop of Canterbury, was succeeded by Alfage, who was of noble extraction, and had been a monk of Deerhust in Gloucestershire; he was afterwards abbot of a society at Bath, from which, by the favour of Dun∣stan, he was preferred to the see of Winchester, which he possessed about two and twenty years. Before his elevation to the see of Canterbury, the fame of his sanctity had spread all over Europe; so that when he went to Rome for the pall the pope received him with uncommon marks of esteem and affection. While he possessed the archbishopric, several councils were held, consisting of temporal and ecclesiastical powers, assembled to remedy the disorders both in church and state. We have already related the catastrophe of this prelate, who was barbarously murdered by the Danes, because he either could not or would not pay the exorbitant ransom they demanded; however he by his death ac∣quired a place in the martyrology; and was succeeded in the see of Canterbury by Living, formerly bishop of Wells, who was taken and maltreated by the Danes, from whom he escaped, after a confinement of seven months, and retired to the continent, where he remained until the troubles had subsided. His suc∣cessor was Agelnorth surnamed the Good, son of Agilsper, and abbot of Can∣terbury, at the time of his predecessor's decease. He had great weight and influence with king Canute, who owed great part of his popularity to this archbishop's advice. A great many ecclesiastical laws were enacted in this prince's reign for the honour and advantage of the church; in particular, a body compiled and enacted at Winchester, confirming, in the strongest terms, the respect due to sanctuaries, and impowering priests to purge themselves of all crimes laid to their charge, by saying mass and taking the sacrament, though the evidence against them should be never so strong.</P>

<P>Whatever pains he might have taken with his royal pupil, he could

not persuade him to comply with the character and genius of the English nation; for, not contented with introducing the manners, customs, and language, of the Normans, he preferred Robert, one of his Norman followers, to the see of Canter∣bury; and two other chaplains successively to the bishopric of London. By which partiality he involved himself in such perplexity and distress, that he was fain to purchase his own ease by suffering these foreigners to be expelled: but, be∣fore this expulsion, one Herman, a Fleming, being promoted to the see of Wilton, was not contented with this provision, but a vacancy happening in the abbey of Malmesbury, sollicited the king for its being added to his bishopric; and the king granted his request, together with an order importing that the abbey should be dissolved in three days. One of the monks, being apprised of this decree, implored the patronage of earl Goodwin, who was pleased with an opportunity to oppose foreign influence at court. He therefore represented to Edward the injustice of his order, and desired he would forthwith recall his grant: Edward dreading his resentment, and perhaps convinced by his remonstrance, immediately complied with his request; and the Fleming left England in great displeasure. But, not relishing the austerities of a monastic life, which he had in his passion embraced, he returned to England during Goodwin's disgrace, and prevailed upon Edward to unite the sees of Ramsbury and Sherburn in his favour.</P>

<P>When Robert, with all the rest of the foreigners, were expelled, the see of Canterbury devolved to Stigand, which he held without resigning the bishopric of Winchester, already in his possession. He had been formerly bishop of Elman, in Norfolk, and ejected in consequence of a quarrel with one Grimkettle; but he found means to retrieve his interest, and be established in the see of Selsey, while his brother Ethelmar was made bishop of the East-Angles. At this period a revolution happened in the see of Crediton in Devon∣shire, which was removed to Exeter, under a Lorrainer called Leoffric, a man of great learning and quality, who was highly honoured and esteemed by Edward and his queen. He ejected all the monks from the monasteries of St. Peter, and in their room introduced canons, who are together at one table, sle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in one apartment, and were provided with food and raiment by a steward of the the bishop's appointing. King Edward being disquieted with some scruples, touching a vow he had made in his distress to visit Rome, which the kingdom was very averse to his performing; he, by the advice of his conncil, sent Alured bishop of Worcester with an embassy to the pope, desiring that his holiness would quiet his conscience, by absolving him of the vow, as the welfare of his subjects did not permit him to undertake the journey in person. Leo IX, who then filled the papal chair, hearing the circumstances explained, complied with the king's request; but, by way of commutation, enjoined him to distribute in alms a sum equal to what he might have expended in his journey; and to found a new monastery, the charter of which he confirmed before hand. Mean while Egilric resigned the see of Durham to his brother Egilwin. He found a great treasure in laying the foundation of a church dedicated to St. Cuthbert; and was so enriched by this accident, that he laid aside his episcopal function, and amused himself in carrying on works of convenience for the emolument of the country.</P>

to Rome, for the confirmation of the privileges bestowed upon this new foundation. The persons nominated for this service were Aldred archbishop of York, Goodwin's son Toston, Giso bishop of Wells, and Walter bishop of Hereford. Pope Nicholas II. received all these deputies with great honour, ex∣cept Aldred, who holding the sees of York and Worcester together, without any dispensation from the pope, was tried and convicted of simon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and divested of his character and jurisdiction. The embassadors being dismissed by his holiness, had scarce lost sight of Rome, when they were set upon and robbed by banditti: a circumstance which obliged them to return to the city, that they might be equipped anew for their journey. Toston took this opportunity of demanding that the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe would indemnify him for the damage he had sustained. Find∣ing no redress, he gave his holi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess to understand, that he suspected him of being concerned in the robbery; and would therefore, at his return to England, prevail upon the king to stop the payment of Peter p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, until he and his fellow-travel∣lers should be reimbursed.</P>

The proposal was embraced, the accommodation effected, and Nicholas sent two legates to assist Aldred in con∣secrating Wulfstan bishop of Worcester; because Stigand archbishop of Canter∣bury was looked upon as an usurper by the see of Rome, inasmuch as he had ta∣ken possession during the life of Robert the Norman, and not yet received the pall from his holiness. Stigand, nevertheless, performed his metropolitanical functions, without paying any regard to the disapprobation of the pope, because he found himself considered and revered as an archbishop by the king and people of England. Nor would he suffer this consecration of Wulfstan to affect his au∣thority; for, he obliged Aldred to declare before the king and council, that he re∣nounced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelman. G.

<P>Together with this short sketch of the English ecclesiastical history, it will not be improper to give a brief abstract of the transactions of the Welsh church during the same period. In or near the reign of Alfred, seven synods were held at Landaff, though the dates of them are very uncertain. In the first, king Tudor was excommunicated for periury and murder. The second, assembled by bishop Berthguin, pronounced the sentence of excommunication against king Clolti, for the same offences. The third passed the like censure upon Gurcan, for the crime of incest with his own mother-in-law. Bishop Cerenhir convoked the fourth synod, by which king Howel was stigmatized for murder and perjury. The same prel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te presided in the sixth, and proceeded in the same manner against Conbli, for the same offences. The seventh was held by Civeillianc, against king Brochvail, who had in some shape incurred his displeasure; and all these kings, who were no other than petty toparchs, made very humble submission, underwent severe penance, and payed heavy fines to the church, before they obtained absolution. Besides these, there was another council convened at the same place, on account of some ravages committed against the church by king Nougu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who submitted to the censure of the synod. A subsequent assem∣bly was called to deliberate upon the violation of a sanctuary, from which the

magistrate had taken by force a deacon guilty of persidious murder. They vigo∣rously supported the rights of the church on this occasion, and compelled the civil power to deliver up the criminal. The last convocation was held by Gucan, whom Dunstan had consecrated bishop of Landaff; in order to denounce excom∣munication against Arthmail, who had murdered his own brother. The criminal submitted to the jurisdiction of the synod, and purchased his pardon with a large sum for the benefit of the clergy.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>BY the defeat of Hastings the English were not only deprived of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1606.</NOTE> their king, but also the flower of their nobility, and left without any feasible scheme or determination by which they could take measures for repairing the loss they had sustained. Harold's brothers were slain, his children had escaped into Ireland, and Edgar Atheling, though beloved by the people as the offspring of their ancient kings, had neither spirit, capacity, nor inclination, to take the helm of government in such a tempestuous season. Count Morcar and his brother Edwin were still alive indeed, and had retired to Lon∣don with the remains of the army; but, their authority was not sufficient to ex∣ecute such measures as were necessary for the preservation of the common-wealth; the diversity of opinions arising from different motives of interest, terror, and de∣spair, produ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a dreadful anarchy of perplexity and consternation.</P>

<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile this distraction prevailed at London, the conqueror considered that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss of a battle might astonish, but would hardly terrify the English into submission; as they had still considerable resources of men and arms, with which
<PB N="216" REF="2250"/>
they would in all likelihood try their fortune again in the field; that if he should be defeated in his turn, he had no place of retreat in which he could find refuge un∣til he should be reinforced from Normandy; and that the party which he had in England might foment divisions in the state, which would operate for his interest, provided he should give them time to practise on the minds of the people; where∣as, should he advance immediately to London, they would unite from the sense of their common danger, before they could find leisure to consult their different views and conjectures. Urged by these reflections, William, instead of marching directly to London, invested Dover, which was strongly fortified by art as well as nature, and provided with a numerous garrison, reinforced by those who es∣caped from the battle; so that it might have made a vigorous desence: but, such was the consternation diffused among them by the success of his arms, that they surrendered in a few days; and he ordered the fortifications to be repaired<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and augmented.</P>

<P>Having tarried about a week in this neighbourhood, in order to ani∣mate the workmen by his presence, he began his march for London; and ad∣vancing in person, with a small body of horse, at a considerable distance from the rest of the army, he is said to have been met by the Kentishmen with boughs in their hands. When he halted to observe this moving forest, they suddenly threw down their branches, and appeared to be a strong body of men, armed with an intention to dispute his passage: while he considered this phenome∣non, the deputies of the Kentishmen approached, and made a tender of their sub∣mission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.</NOTE> provided he would not infringe their privileges. William granted their demand; and they took the oath of allegiance, and retired. But, even after this impediment was removed, he could not proceed with much expedition, because a dysentery prevailed in his army, and he himself was seized with the same dis∣temper, which not a little retarded his march.</P>

<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>By this time Morcar and Edwin had assembled in London almost all the remaining nobility of the kingdom, to deliberate upon measures to be ta∣ken in the present emergency, both for settling the government of the nation, and raising an army to oppose the Normans. The two brothers proposed that Edgar Atheling should be placed upon the throne; and this motion was warmly seconded by archbishop Stigand and the Londoners, who were extremely rich and powerful; but the greatest part of the clergy favoured the designs of the Nor∣man, either because they looked upon him as a devout prince, under whom the church would flourish, or dreaded the curses and resentment of the pope, who had already declared in his behalf. They could not, however, with all their arts, prevent Edgar from being proclaimed king of England; though they had inte∣rest enough to prevent his levying such an army as could support his authority against such a powerful rival. The excercise of his sovereignty was therefore of very short duration.</P>

<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>William continued advancing in three divisions, by three different routes; and his men were ordered, if they should meet with any resistance, to de∣stroy the country with fire and sword. Accordingly, slight pretences were made handles for committing terrible outrages, at which the duke connived, on the supposition, that such severity would intimidate the English, and facilitate their submission. As he approached the capital, in this manner, the terrors of the people waxed stronger and stronger, and the clergy employed all their industry and insi∣nuation
<PB N="217" REF="2260"/>
to dissuade them from making a resistance, which would only serve to exasperate the victor; whereas they might expect the confirmation of their liberty and privileges in the way of negotiation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>These remonstrances, added to the nearness of the danger, had such weight with the citizens of London, who had more at stake than any other sub∣jects of England, that their courage began to flag, and they earnestly expressed a desire of accommodation. Morcar and Edwin, with a view to animate their party, took the opportunity to sally out from London upon William, who arrived in the neighbourhood of that city at the head of his first division. They resolved to attack him before he could be sustained by the rest of his army, and hoped to find him fatigued from his march: but the Norman was too vigi∣lant<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1066.</NOTE> to be so surprized; and gave them such a warm reception, that they were fain to retire with great precipitation. This check dispirited the friends of Ed∣gar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Pictav.</NOTE> and furnished the clergy with fresh arguments in favour of the measures they had proposed; so that they soon made a multitude of proselytes to their opinion, while Edwin and his brother, perceiving Edgar's cause desperate, re∣treated with their forces to the northern provinces.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>By this time the advanced parties of the Normans had burned the sub∣urbs on the Surry side of the river, by the command of William, whose army passing the Thames at Wallingford, was now as far as Berghamstead in their march to London; so that the nobles and prelates, assembled at London, would no longer delay to seize the only opportunity they would have to plead the merit of a voluntary submission. They accordingly went forth, attended by the magis∣trates of London, and meeting the duke at the head of his troops, made a so∣lemn tender of the crown. He received them with great courtesy, and after having taken time to deliberate upon the proposal, accepted the offer they had made, and assured them they should have no cause to repent of their choice: he did not think proper however to trust himself in the city of London, but established his head quarters at Berking, in Essex, until a fort could be built in the city to overawe the inhabitants. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward Atheling, encouraged by the report of his affability, went thither to renounce his pretensions, and implored the protection of William, by whom he was graciously received. Morcar and Edwin having no further pre∣text for keeping aloof, sollicited his forgiveness, and disbanding their troops, went to receive his commands; and their example was followed by all the lords and corporations of the kingdom. The Norman, having thus acknowledged the power of election in the people of England, in deigning to receive the crown as a present, was immediately proclaimed king, and appointed the day for his coronation at London. Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, lying under a sen∣tence of suspension by the pope, to whom William owed great obligations, this prince, in order to avoid any objection that might be made with respect to the in∣formality of his consecration, desired that the ceremony might be performed by Aldred, archbishop of York, who, upon that occasion, addressing himself to the English, assembled in great numbers, asked if they chose William, duke of Normandy, for their king; and was answered in the affirmative with loud ac∣clamations. The bishop of Constance having put the same question to the Nor∣mans, and received the like reply, Aldred set the crown on his head; and then
<PB N="218" REF="2270"/>
the Norman took the accustomed oath, importing that he would protect the church and its ministers, govern his people with equity, enact just laws, and cause<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> them to be punctually observed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>The first act of sovereignty he exercised after his coronation was the seizure of Harold's treasure, which he found amassed at Winchester. Part of this he distributed among the principal officers of his army; part was given to churches and monasteries; and a large share sent to the pope, either to discharge a debt, which he owed to his holiness, or as a mark of his gratitude for the coun∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nance<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul. Pict.</NOTE> of that pontiff, to which he in a great measure owed his success. He be∣gun his reign with such moderation as afforded a happy omen to his subjects. He exhorted his principal officers to treat the English with humanity, and respect them as brothers; he issued orders through his army, forbidding his soldiers to attempt the chastity of the women, or commit the least outrage against the inha∣bitants, under the severest penalties; and he published an edict, confirming all the privileges of the people, and all the promises he had made in their behalf. This specimen of his equity had a wonderful effect among the English, who vied with each other in testifying their loyalty and esteem, by presenting him with great sums of money, which helped him to defray the expence of the conquest: nor could they blame his conduct, when he divided among his followers the lands of all the noblemen who had appeared in arms against him, as well those that fell as those that survived the battle. This was looked upon as a common act of justice, especially as he at the same time confirmed the rest in the possession of their estates. Among these, he distinguished with particular marks of favour, Ed∣gar Atheling, called the darling of the English, whom he not only allowed to retain the earldom of Oxford, but affected to caress on all occasions, as the ne∣phew of his benefactor Edward. On other English noblemen he conferred posts of importance, both in Britain and Normandy, and projected matches between his officers and the ladies of England, while he provided English husbands for<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Paris.</NOTE> the Norman heiresses, as if his intention had been to unite the two nations.</P>
<P>He granted a new charter to the city of London, confirming the privileges which the citizens enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor; he preserved the Saxon laws and constitution; he made a progress into the provinces of Mer∣cia and Wessex, to confirm by his presence and personal deportment, the great idea which the people had conceived from his fame. As the country was in∣fested with robbers, who found shelters in the woods, he exerted himself in ex∣terminating those banditti. He made excellent regulations for the security of the subjects from violence and rapine; and, as another instance of his piety and mode∣ration, founded an abbey on the spot where Harold had fallen, to which he gave the name of Battel, and there ordered mass to be said for the repose of Ha∣rold's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. Ib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> soul.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">

<P>In the midst of those popular transactions, he did not neglect to take thenece ssary precautions for preserving his conquest. The Tower of London, and the other forts he had erected at Norwich, Winchester, Hereford, Hastings, and Dover, were provided with strong Norman garrisons, and the citizens of London, as well as the other natives of the realm, whom the Saxon laws obliged to appear once a year in arms, furnished at their own expence, were now disincumbered of this unnecessary burthen. These steps were taken with the more expedition, as he longed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o revisit h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s native country, and manifest to his own natural
<PB N="$$9" REF="2280"/>
born subjects, the importance of his conquest. Having therefore no reason to ap∣prehend any disturbance in his absence among the English, whose affection he had taken such pains to conciliate; he left the regency with his brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux, and William Fitzosberne; and that he might neglect no means that sound policy dictated, he resolved to carry along with him all the English noblemen, from whose power or inclination he could ap∣prehend a revolt or insurrection. The chief of these, were Edwin, and Mor∣car, Waltheof, son of the renowned Siward, and Edgar Atheling, together with Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, whom he affected to treat with all the exterior marks of the most profound respect: indeed his pretence for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmefb. de Gest.

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>With this train of honourable captives he set sail for Normandy, where he was received by his natural subjects with marks of excessive joy and admiration;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1067.</NOTE> and he passed his Christmas at Frescamp, where he was visited by an ambassador with a numerous retinue, sent by the king of France to congratulate him upon his accession to the English throne. He received this embassy with great state and magnificence, calculated to dazzle the eyes of the sender, and spent the whole winter in Normandy in feast and rejoicing. Notwithstanding all the precau∣tions<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Pictav.</NOTE> he had taken to secure the tranquillity of his new kingdom, murmurs, discontent, and at last open insurrection, were excited in it, by the tyranny and oppression of the regents, who acted as if they had been ordered to provoke the English to a rebellion, which might furnish the conqueror with a pretence for de∣priving them of their liberty and constitution. Odo and Fitzoberne took all oppor∣tunities of fleecing the people who were subjected to their government; and this oppression was rendered the more intolerable by the insults they underwent in at∣tempting to obtain redress. The inhabitants of Kent, who were more immediately exposed to these outrages, having repeated their complaints and remonstrances to no purpose, at length had recourse to Eustace, count of Boulogne, who was at that time at variance with the Norman, and glad of an opportunity to lessen his interest in England. He therefore agreed to land a body of troops in the neighbourhood of Dover, while Hugh de Montfort, the governor of that for∣tress, was absent, with part of the garrison; and these being joined by the Kentish∣men, attacked the castle, which they hoped to surprize; but the Normans were upon their guard, and received them so warmly that they were soon forced to re∣tire<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>This miscarriage did not deter Edric surnamed the Forrester from seek∣ing redress of his grievances, in his own valour and conduct. He was nephew to the infamous Edric Streona, who had so often betrayed the interest of Ethelred and Edmund Ironside, and possessed a considerable part of the counties of Salop and Hereford. He had accompanied Edwin and other noblemen to London, when they swore allegiance to William, from whom he had met with a very gracious reception; but in the absence of the conqueror, his lands were conti∣nually ravaged by Richard Fitzscrope and other officers belonging to the Nor∣man
<PB N="2$$" REF="2290"/>
garrisons of that district, lying under the particular government of William Fitzosbern. Edric, who was brave, vigilant, and enterprizing, did not allow them to make such encroachments with impunity: on the contrary, he commonly lay in ambush, and attacked the pillagers in their return; so that they lost a conside∣rable number of men in these incursions. At length Edric, seeing no end to these insults, resolved to retort their depredations; and being joined by a body of Welch, entered Herefordshire, and wasted the country as far as the Lugge, from whence<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> he returned in triumph, with a considerable booty. Besides this adventure, infur∣rections were raised in other parts of the country, and were with great difficulty suppressed by the joint forces of Odo and the earl of Hereford: such was the re∣sentment of the nation against the rapacious Normans, that Earl Coxo was slain by his own vassals, because he would not head them in open rebellion; and great numbers of those foreigners were set upon and cut off by bands of people that rendezvoused in woods and forests.</P>

<P>William, being informed of these commotions, left the government of Normandy to Queen Mathilda and his eldest son Robert, and arrived in England time enough to prevent the execution of a scheme, which the English had form∣ed to deliver themselves from the Norman yoke. They had already taken the resolution to massacre all those strangers on Ashwednesday, during the time of divine service, at which all the Normans would certainly assist unarmed, as peni∣tents, according to the discipline of those days; but William's arrival broke all their measures, and the chiefs of this conspiracy retiring to the north, fortified the city of Durham, and set his power at defiance.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edwin, the most powerful and popular nobleman in England, he attached to his interest by promising to give him his daughter in marriage; and he had raised such a number of fortresses in different parts of the kingdom, that he no longer dreaded the tumultuous and transitory efforts of a dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntented multitude. In these sentiments, he determined to treat them as a co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quered nation, especially as in so doing he should be able to erect an abso∣lute tyranny, to which he was disposed by nature and inclination; to indulge his avarice, and at the same time gratify his followers, who expected to receive ex∣traordinary recompence, in proportion to the extraordinary success which their arms had enabled him to enjoy.</P>

<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The first signal of his arbitrary power was manifested in renewing the odious tax of Danegeit, which had been abolished by Edward the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fessor; a step which produced murmurs and discontent through the whole kingdom, and induced archbishop Aldred to exhort the king to remit an exorbitant imposition, which could not fail to be attended with fatal consequences. William signified his displeasure at the freedom of this remonstrance; and, far from complying with the advice, ordered the Danegelt to be levied with extraordinary rigour. These proceedings intimidated all that part of the country which was a witness of his great power, and immediately subject to the terrors of a standing army;
<PB N="221" REF="2300"/>
but, the more remote provinces of Cornwal and Devonshire, revolted in defence of their independency, and the city of Exeter refused to admit a Norman garrison. William, incensed at this instance of their presumption, began his march im∣mediately from London, though the winter was far advanced; and was met at some distance from the city by the magistrates, who made a tender of submission, and delive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed hostages, as pledges of their obedience; but the populace renounced the conduct of their magistracy, and raised a tumult, in which the gates were shut against the king, who, provoked at this outrage, commanded one of the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tages to be deprived of his eyes, in the view of the mutineers, and then investing the place, began to carry on his advances in form. The people, terrified at these approaches, sent another deputation to implore his mercy, and surrendered the town at discretion; so that he had an opportunity of manifesting his clemency, by pardoning the rebels and protecting the city from being plundered. He took a more effectual method to prevent future insurrections, by building a citadel, in which he placed a strong garrison under the command of Baldwin de Molis, on whom he likewise bestowed the government of the country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>From hence he repaired to Winchester, where he kept his Easter. The queen Mathilda arriving at this city immediately after the holidays, was solemnly crowned by archbishop Aldred; and before the expiration of the year delivered of a son called Henry, who afterwards ascended the throne.</P>
<P>William, loth to part with the sums which he had raised by the Danegelt, and being teized with the importunities of his Norman dependents, sent com∣missaries into every county, to take information of all those freeholders who had served under Harold, at the battle of Hastings, and consiscated their estates, which were given to Norman officers: this was perhaps the most unjust inquisi∣tion that ever any tyrant set up; and therefore increased the dissatisfaction of the En∣glish to such a degree, that they were ripe for a general insurrection. The peo∣ple, on this occasion, naturally turned their eyes upon the two brothers Edwin and Morcar, from whose valour alone they expected deliverance from the Nor∣man oppression. These noblemen felt for the distresses of their country, and were by this time very well disposed to act for its relief, inasmuch as they plainly saw that William doubted their fidelity, and even refused to perform the promise he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d made to Edwin. Notwithstanding their great power and interest in England as well as in Wales, the prince of which, called Blethwyn, was their ne∣phew, they would not run the risque of an open rupture with such a formidable prince as William, until they had first sollicited succours from Swein, king of Denmark, and actually received assurances of a reinforcement from Malcolm, who at that time occupied the Scottish throne. These precautions being taken, they assembled their forces in Yorkshire, and openly declared their design of de∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oning a tyrant whose aim was to enslave and oppress the nation.</P>

<P>William immediately put himself at the head of his army, and be∣gan his march to the north, building, as he advanced, strong castles at Notting∣ham and Warwick, the command of which he bestowed upon William de Pe∣verell, and Henry de Newburg, whom he afterwards created earl of Warwick. Mean while, the two earls, Morcar and Edwin, who expected strong reinforce∣ments from all parts of the kingdom, finding themselves disappointed in their hope, and in danger of being abandoned by the troops already assembled, who exhibited evident marks of fear and consternation as the king approached, re∣solved
<PB N="222" REF="2310"/>
to make their own peace; or, if that should be impracticable, to retire in∣to another country. They accordingly had recourse to the clemency of the con∣queror, who did not think proper to reject the advances of two such powerful and popular noblemen, and therefore pardoned them without further hesi∣tation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id ibid.</NOTE></P>

<P>Nevertheless he continued his march to York; was met by the citizens, who made their submission, and presented the keys of their city, in which he built a citadel, and secured the place with a Norman garrison. At the same time Archillus, the most powerful nobleman of Northumberland, who had been concerned in the revolt, was pardoned, in consideration of delivering his son as an hostage for his future fidelity; and Egelwin, bishop of Durham, having obtained grace for himself and that city, was employed as a mediator to effect an accommodation with Malcolm, king of Scotland. This prince was actually on his march to join Morcar and Edwin, when he received the over∣tures for a treaty of peace, which was immediately concluded; and then he sent ambassadors to do homage to William for the kingdom of Cumberland, which he held of the English crown.</P>

<P>The king, in his return from this expedition, ordered strong castles to be built at Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge, for the security of these counties; a precaution the more necessary at this period, as they were infested by the incursions of the famous Hereward le Wake, lord of Brunne, in Norfolk, who returning from his travels, and finding his patrimony in the hands of the Normans, assembled a hardy band of his vassals, at the head of whom he ejected and slew the intruders, and ravaged the neighbouring country from motives of revenge. The march of William towards the north, and the discontent that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>These commotions happening on the back of one another, seem to con∣firm the conqueror's suspicion and hatred of the English; whom he there∣fore resolved for the future to rule with severity and circumspection. He order∣ed a great number of individuals to be imprisoned, without any cause assigned, for no other reason than to prevent their engaging in conspiracies; and those who dreaded the same treatment, determined to anticipate his caution, by with∣drawing from the kingdom of their own accord. Gospatrick and Merleswain, two noblemen in the north, inspired with this apprehension for themselves as well as for Edgar Atheling, persuaded that prince to accompany them to Scot∣land, to which he accordingly retired by sea, with his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, Margaret and Christina; and there they met with a very hospitable recep∣tion from Malcolm, who married the eldest sister, by whom he had Mathilda<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Wig. Hoved.</NOTE> or Maud, grandmother of Henry II. king of England, in whom the Saxon was united with the Norman blood. Malcolm's generosity and marriage drew a great number of the discontented lords into Scotland, where they formed projects for delivering their country from the Norman yoke. They carried on a close correspondence with all the malecontents who remained in England: some
<PB N="223" REF="2320"/>
of their number repaired to Denmark, where they importuned Swein for assis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ance, and others had recourse to the Irish, who seemed very well disposed to succour them in their endeavours: but their chief hope rested upon Malcolm, who had already interested himself so warmly in their behalf. Had all those negociations been carried on with vigour and unanimity at the same juncture of time, and the English agreed in the choice of an enterprising chief, who had importance enough to maintain his precedency, perhaps William might have been obliged to renounce his conquest; but the individuals were undetermined, jealous, and independent of each other; consequently their councils were dis∣tracted, and their allies unresolved.</P>

<P>William was not ignorant of these machinations, and suspecting the Northumbrians, whom he knew to be a restless people, would not long remain quiet after the retreat of his army, he detached Robert de Cumin, with seven hundred soldiers, to take possession of Durham, in order to maintain the peace of the county, of which this general was appointed governor. Notwithstand∣ing the caution he received from bishop Egelwin, who advised him to be upon his guard against the animosity of the inhabitants, he permitted his men to range about the city in small parties, and commit all manner of insults and rapine, and even to make incursions into the adjacent country, which they plundered at will. These violences incensed the Northumbrians to such a degree, that they assembled in great numbers, and, breaking into the city, slew all the Normans that sell in their way; then they attacked the archbishop's palace, in which Cu∣min was lodged, but meeting with such a vigorous resistance from the gover∣nor and his attendants, that they could not force the gates, they set fire to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

<P>The people of York, animated by the success of this enterprize, fell<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Soon as William received this in∣telligence he ordered his forces to march, and advanced with such expedition, that the besiegers had scarce any intimation of his approach, until he was in sight of their works. An engagement immediately ensued, and they were routed with great slaughter; for he was so much incensed, that he granted no quarter to the vanquished. Here he staid a week, during which another for∣tress was erected, and then he retired to Winchester; yet, he was no sooner de∣parted, than the inhabitants attacked both castles, and were repulsed.</P>

<P>The nation being thus unsettled, and every day threatened with fresh commotions, William sent his queen back to Normandy; and a good number of his Norman officers, tired with the fatigue of the service, and inti∣midated by the prospect of continual wars and desolation, desired they might be dismissed to their own country; rejecting the offers of considerable re∣wards and preferments, rather than encounter the dangers that must have at∣tended their stay in England. Amongst those who deserted their master in this emergency, were Hugh de Grentemesnil and Humphrey de Tolleul, governors of Winchester and Hastings, whose lands William confiscated out of resentment for their desertion; nor could he ever be prevailed upon to restore their heirs to the dignities thus forfeited. The effects of the negociations carried on by
<PB N="224" REF="2330"/>
English malecontents, now began to appear. The sons of Harold made ano∣ther attempt from Ireland, and landed in the northern parts of Devonshire; but were so vigorously attacked by Bryan, son of Eudo, count of Bretagne, that they were fain to re-imbark by night, with the loss of seventeen hundred<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor.

<P>In a little time after this attempt, the Danish fleet appeared on the eastern coast of England, under the command of Osbern, brother to Swein, whose two sons, Harold and Canute, were on board. Their forces landed up∣on different counties, where they met with divers repulses, till at length arriv∣ing at the mouth of the Humber, they were joined by Edgar Atheling and the discontented lords, with a fleet of ships and a body of land forces from Scot∣land; and sailing up the river together, were still further reinforced by the inhabitants of Yorkshire and Northumberland, commanded by Gaius, Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius, and Archillus. All these forces joined, amounted to a considerable army, with which they advanced to besiege York, the garrison of which was commanded by Mailet, who ordered the suburbs to be burnt down, that they might not af∣ford lodgments or materials to the enemy. The wind being very high when this order was put in execution, the flames communicated themselves to the ci∣ty, which was totally reduced to ashes; and the Danes taking advantage of the consternation and perplexity that such an accident must have produced, entered the castle pell-mell, and put all the Normans to the sword. The whole city, with the cathedral and monastery of St Peter, perished by this conflagration, and of three thousand Normans, divided in the two forts, none but Mallet, his wife, and children, and some of the principal officers, were spared; these the Danes took prisoners, and carried to their ships in the Humber, together with a very considerable booty; leaving an English garrison in the place, under the com∣mand of count Waltheof, son of the renowned Siward.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>When William was informed of this disaster, he swore by the splendour of God, that he would not leave a Northumbrian alive; and when he arrived on the borders of Yorkshire, he began to put his menaces in execu∣tion, committing terrible ravages, and destroying every thing that fell in his way. By this time the Danes had taken possession of a strong post, between the Ouse and the Trent, from whence he saw it would be a very difficult enterprize to dislodge them; he therefore had recourse to a more easy expedient; and sent private emissaries, with an offer of a large sum to Osbern, and permission to pillage all the sea-coast, provided he would desist from other acts of hostility, and retire in the spring. These terms were embraced, and he returned in the spring to Denmark, where his brother Swein punished him severely for having so perfidiously deserted his allies. After this capitulation, the king advanced against York, the siege of which he immediately undertook, and having made some progress in his operations, ordered an assault to be given. The attack was very furious: but the place was defended so vigorously by the English and Scots, that the Normans were repulsed with great slaughter; the valiant Waltheof planted himself in the breach, and with his battle-ax cleft down the assailants as fast as they advanced. This worthy son of old Siward, count of Northumber∣land, behaved with such vigilance, conduct, and intrepidity, in the defence of the place, that William began to despair of reducing it, when famine compelled the governor to capitulate. The king, who had been eye-witness of his extra∣ordinary
<PB N="225" REF="2340"/>
merit, not only granted him honourable terms, but afterwards bestow∣ed his own niece Judith upon him in marriage, and created him successively count of Northampton, Huntingdon, and Northumberland. He, at the same time, received Gospatrick into his favour, and found him a faithful and serviceable adherent in the sequel; but he punished the rest of the officers and soldiers of the garrison with great severity, and mulcted the inhabitants in a very large fine.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The city being properly secured with Norman garrisons, he gave a loose to his vengeance against the Northumbrians, and ravaged the country in such a cruel manner, that there was not a house left standing between York and Durham. He did not even spare the churches and other public buildings. This desolation was attended with the most shocking misery: the wretched people, deprived of habitation and subsistence, wandered about in distraction and despair, seeing their tender infants perishing by famine and cold, and their friends and neigh∣bours falling in heaps, after having endeavoured to prolong their lives by devouring<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmesb. Sim. Dun.</NOTE> dogs, cats; vermin, and even feeding upon human carcases. From such scenes of horrour and distress, great numbers of the common people fled into Scotland, and settled in the lowlands, which they greatly improved with agriculture; abun∣dance of the better sort, whose estates were confiscated, or whose minds were averse to the Norman sway, retired also to that country, where they were kindly re∣ceived by queen Margaret and her husband Malcolm, who assigned lands for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lesley de ori∣gine &amp; gest.

<P>Rebellion multiplied like the Hydra's heads; one revolt was no sooner quelled in one place, than two fresh commotions began in other parts of the country. When William set out on the northern expedition, the people in∣habiting the counties of Somerset and Dorset, rose in arms, and besieged Monta∣cute; but were defeated by the justiciary Geoffry, bishop of Coutance, who marched against them with the forces of London, Hants, and Wiltshire: at the same time Edric the Forrester invested Shrewsbury; which, however, he could not reduce; and the people of Devonshire and Cornwal undertook the siege of Ex∣eter, which they were obliged to raise, by the bravery of the garrison, assisted by the inhabitants.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Against the Welsh and Cheshire men, who still kept in a body under Edric, the king began his march from York across the country; and in the course of his route through fens, marshes, woods, and over mountains, the army was so much fatigued, that the soldiers of Anjou, Maine, and Bretagne, desired to be dismissed. Willliam, however, encouraged them to proceed, and they arrived at Chester, where he made overtures of accommodation to Edric, whose valour he admired; and that nobleman complying with his proposals, ever after enjoyed a great share of his confidence and esteem. This was a more effec∣tual step towards the pacification of Mercia, than that of building castles at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Wig.</NOTE> Chester and Stafford, which being finished and supplied with garrisons, he marched to Salisbury, where he dismissed all his troops with suitable rewards, except those who had murmured in his march, and these he detained forty days after the rest were disbanded, by way of punishment for their mutinous behaviour: thence he repaired to Winchester, where he was crowned by Ermenfroy, bishop of Sion, assisted by John and Peter, two cardinals sent over as legates from the pope.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>All the sources of rebellion being now exhausted by policy or war, William, in order to prevent their filling again, resolved to depress all English∣men
<PB N="226" REF="2350"/>
of power and credit in such a manner as to render them incapable of raising any considerable disturbance against his reign for the future. With this view he suddenly deprived them of all their offices, baronies, and fiefs holding of the crown, and distributed them among the Normans and other strangers who had followed his fortune. But, as these bore a small proportion in point of number to the English who were stripped, he loaded his countrymen with bene∣fits before he could dispose of all the lands taken from the natives. He bestowed upon his uterine brother Robert, the county of Cornwal, comprehending two hundred and eighty-eight manours, besides five hundred and fifty-eight, which he possessed in other provinces. His next brother Odo was created count palatine of Kent and high justiciary of England, with above four hundred fiefs in diffe∣rent provinces. William Fitzosbern's services were compensated with the whole county o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hereford. William's nephew, Hugh Loup, was presented with the county palatine of Chester, to be held with all the rights of regality, as inde∣pendent of the crown. His son-in-law Alain Fergeant, duke of Bretagne, was put in possession of all the estates formerly belonging to count Mor∣car, with the same rights of regality. To Roger de Montgomery he gave first of all the towns of Arundel and Chichester, and afterwards the coun∣ty of Salop. Walter Giffard obtained the county of Buckingham; and that of Surry fell to the share of William Warren. Eudes, count of Blois, re∣ceived the lordship of Holderness. Raoul de Guair, of Bretagne, was cre∣ated count or earl of Norfolk and Suffolk, and lord of Norwich. Henry de Ferrieres was complimented with the castle of Tutbury. And Geoffry, bishop of Coutance, justiciary of England, possessed two hundred and eighty manours, which he bequeathed at his death to his nephew Robert de Mowbray. All these possessions were held by the same tenour as the estates in Normandy, where the feudal law preva led in full force; subject to the same forfeitures, and descend∣ing in the same order of succession. Thus was laid the foundation of what is cal∣led the common law of England, the terms and proceedings of which, so far<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Gloss <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acy.</NOTE> as it relates to tenures and estates, are evidently derived from the language and customs of the Normans.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>In this manner was England delivered into the hands of foreigners: and we may well suppose that the Norman lords would parcel out those lands in copyholds or inferior fiefs to their own countrymen. The barons exercised all kinds of jurisdictions within their own manours; they held courts, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> they administered justice to their own vassals: the disputes arising between the tenants of different baronies were decided in the county or hundred courts, and the suits between barons were cognizable only in the king's tribunals. The judges and lawyers were Normans, consequently the pleadings were carried on in the language of that country: so that the English could expect very little redress, when they complained of the oppression and insults they underwent<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>q Sp <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</NOTE> from their foreign superiors. Although, upon a representation of the hard∣ships, suffered in this respect by the people, made by Guismund, afterwards carcinal and bishop of Aversa, William consented to allow them the benefits of some of the old laws relating to forfeitures, fines, and amerciaments, in cri∣minal matters, and the rates of reliefs and mortuaries due to superior lords, those laws were easily wrested or evaded to answer the purposes of oppression. Nay, to such slavish restrictions were they reduced, that all persons whatsoever of the
<PB N="227" REF="2360"/>
commonalty in towns and villages, were commanded on pain of death to put out their fires and candles on the ringing of a bell, which was thence dis∣tinguished<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Moulin.</NOTE> by the appellation of couvre feu or cover fire, since corrupted into curfew; a regulation which, though it had been practised at Caen in Normandy, for the prevention of riots, conflagrations, and other mischievous accidents, was, by the free independent spirit of the English, construed into the most despo∣tic exertion of arbitrary power, and resented accordingly.</P>

<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The severity of the conqueror's plan was not confined to the nobi∣lity and the commons, but extended also to the clergy, whose charters he vio∣lated without scruple, paying no manner of regard to the imprecations which former kings had denounced against those of their successors who should attempt to infringe or annul the exemptions which they granted to bishops, abbeys, and churches. He ordained that church-lands, as well as others, should be subject to military service, and furnish a certain number of horsemen in time of war; and if any ecclesiastic refused to comply with this ordinance, he was removed from his benefice, which was given to a stranger: besides, he lodged almost his whole army at free quarters in monasteries. By these means he maintained his troops, without diminishing his own revenue, and at the same time kept a neces∣sary watch over the conduct of the monks, who were very apt to intermeddle in politics. He executed another project, which was still more provoking to that venerable body, and intailed upon him the secret curses of the people. Being informed by his emissaries that many families had deposited their plate and money in monasteries, he ordered all those religious houses to be searched, and seized upon every thing that was valuable, pretending it belonged to the rebels; he did not even spare the shrines of saints and the sacred vases on this occasion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Not yet satisfied with these measures for the humiliation of the clergy, he resolved to depress some bishops and abbots, whose wealth and credit he looked upon with jealousy and disquiet. That he might proceed, however, in a judicial form on such important affairs, he directed the pope's two legates to assemble a council at Westminster, in which Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, was deposed for having intruded himself into that see, of which his predecessor Robert had not been canonically deprived. Agelmar, bishop of Elmham in East-Anglia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> Algeric of Durham, and some other prelates, disagreeable to the king, met with the same fate; while others to whose conduct he could take no ex∣ception, were banished or imprisoned without form of process, and their places filled with strangers from different climes. Lanfranc, an Italian, and formerly abbot of a monastery in Caen, he promoted to the see of Canterbury; Thomas, a canon of Bayeux, was created archbishop of York; the dioceses of Winchester, Elmham, and Selsey, were bestowed upon three of his own chaplains, and the abbeys from which the English were expelled, supplied with Norman superiors; nevertheless, it must be owned that these places were filled with persons of dis∣tinguished merit. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rog. de Hov.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>William, in order to maintain those encroachments on the liber∣ty of the nation, found it necessary to support a large standing army, which could not be subsisted without great oeconomy, aswell as an immense revenue: he there∣fore, among other regulations, erected the court of exchequer, for auditing and passing the accounts of all officers employed in collecting the crown revenue; for determining all actions relating thereto, and punishing the exactions and
<PB N="228" REF="2370"/>
irregularities of the collectors, as well as the delays and defaults of payment in the subject. His revenue, exclusive of the old demesne lands set apart for sup∣plying his houshold with all sorts of provision, consisted in a land tax called Danegelt, a quit-rent out of all the lands of England, wardships, reliefs, and fines, livery of hereditary lands, assignation of dower, licenses of marriage, leave to sue in the king's-court, mulcts and forfeitures for marrying without li∣cence, and other mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emeanors, and other pecuniary penalties, by which all sorts of crimes were punished; tolls and customs for passage, pontage, freedom of fairs and markets, protection and liberty of buying and selling, and duties laid upon merchandize. Besides these general branches, he received occasional aids due from the fees of those who held of the crown by knight's-service; and occasionally levied taillage upon socage tenants, and trading towns: so that his revenue amounted to about four hundred thousand pounds a year, every pound being really equal to that weight of silver, consequently the whole to be estimated at twelve hundred thou∣sand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. Vital.</NOTE> pounds of the present computation; a sum, which considering the difference of prices between that period and the present time, was equivalent to twelve millions of money of modern estimation. How rich and powerful then must this king have been, who, over and above this vast income, constantly main∣tained sixty thousand knights, by quartering them upon monasteries or assigning lands for their subsistence!</P>

<DIV4 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>This standing army was more grievous to the subject than all the other impositions combined: and far from taming them into abject sub∣mission, served only to render them desperate, and excite them to enterprizes that should end either in liberty or destruction. A new conspiracy was formed under the auspices of Frederic, abbot of St. Alban's, for driving the king and Normans out of the country; and the scheme was executed with such conduct and secrecy, that a considerable army was assembled before William received the least intimation of their design. Edgar Atheling, arriving from Scotland, put himself at the head of this insurrection, and was proclaimed king of England in all the places that favoured their intention. The Norman was extremely disturbed by this bold enterprize, which seemed to be the prelude of a general revolt; and he im∣parted the subject of his disquiet to Lanfranc, the new archbishop of Canterbury, who advised him to treat the English with less severity, and commence a negotia∣tion with the rebels before the flame should spread itself all over the kingdom. William accordingly proposed a conference with the chiefs of the mal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>contents at Berkhamstead, where he heard with great temper the recapitulation of all their grievances, and not only promised to redress them, but swore upon the evangelists he would reestablish the laws of Edward the Confessor. The male∣contents, satisfied with this condescension in a prince of his character, dismissed their troops, and returned to their own homes; and the king no sooner understood they were dispersed, than without paying the least regard to his oath, which he considered as an extorted obligation, ordered a great number of those who had taken up arms, to be apprehended, and some of them were put to death, some im∣pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned and banished the realm. Edgar returned to Scotland, others fled for refuge to Ireland, Denmark, and Norway, and the abbot of St. Alban's retired to the isle of Ely, where he soon died of grief and disappointment. William im∣mediate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eized the effects of his monastery, which he would have ruined in∣tirely,

<P>While the tyranny of William intimidated one part of the nation into unresisting slavery, it exasperated others into efforts of revenge. A good number of these desperate adventurers retired to the isle of Ely, which being surrounded by a morass, they thought they should be able to defend themselves from William's power. Thither he two brothers Morcar and Edwin re∣paired from court, where they found themselves exposed to the most imminent danger from the king's jealousy; though Edwin was afterwards killed by his own attendants, in his journey towards Scotland, which he undertook with a view to engage Malcolm in the cause of the revolters. Egelric and Egelwin, bishops of Durham and Hereford, together with many other persons of distinction, joined the malecontents of Ely, who chose for their general the valiant Here∣ward de Wake, who had, since his return to England, never ceased to harrass the Normans, and was esteemed the bravest soldier and most expert warrior of his age. This nobleman being invested with the chief command, and justly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph. Hoveden.</NOTE> supposing that the place would soon be attacked by William, employed all his skill and attention in augmenting and improving the defences, and laying in a sufficient store of provision for a tedious siege. The king, who was well ac∣quainted with Hereward's capacity, ordered his troops to march immediately, in hope of surprizing him before he should be prepared for opposition; but he found such precautions already taken, that he retained no hope of reducing the place by any other way than that of starving the besieged; and therefore he converted his operations into a blockade. This, however, was a very tedious method of proceeding, as Hereward was plentifully supplied with provision, and the more vexatious to William at this juncture, as he was apprized of an irruption into the northern provinces made by Malcolm, king of Scotland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>At length he contrived a scheme which succeeded to his wish: he seized the lands belonging to the abbey which stood within the isle, and distri∣buted them among his courtiers; an alienation that raised a prodigious clamour among the monks, who importuned their abbot Thurstan to make peace with the king, so as that their manours should be restored. The abbot, thus incited, sent a private emissary to William, with a promise of delivering the isle into his hands, together with a thousand marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilver, provided he would reestablish him in possession of the lands he had taken away. The king complied with this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> advantageous proposal, and the monks found means to admit his troops into the island, so as to surprize the besieged. Hereward, finding himself betrayed, cut his passage through the Norman troops, sword in hand; but the rest were obliged to surrender at discretion. Some were punished with the loss of their eyes, others had their hands cut off, and a few were committed to close prison; among these last was Morcar and Egelwin, bishop of Durham, though the lat∣ter, for having excommunicated the king, was afterwards starved to death at Abingdon. The monks themselves did not escape unpunished, notwithstanding<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paris. Mart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hoved.

<P>During these transactions, Malcolm ravaged the northern provinces with great barbarity, pillaging, burning, and destroying the open towns and vil∣lages,
<PB N="230" REF="2390"/>
and butchering, without distinction of age or sex, all those miserable wretches whom he deemed unfit for the purposes of slavery. Gospatric, gover∣nor of Northumberland, finding himself too weak to oppose the progress of Malcolm by giving him battle, endeavoured to make a diversion by entering the kingdom of Cumberland, in which he committed the like excesses; so that they seemed to vye with each other in acts of cruelty and depredation. William, alarmed at these hostilities, had no sooner quelled the revolt at Ely, than he began his march for Scotland, whither Malcolm had, by this time, retired with a pro∣digious booty. After the English army had sustained incredible fatigues in such a long and troublesome march, the king arrived on the borders, and advancing into Northumberland, found Malcolm in possession of a very advantageous post, from whence he could not attempt to dislodge him, without incurring the most imminent danger. William therefore incamped in his neighbourhood; and the two armies lay facing one another for several days, during which both generals seemed unwilling to begin a battle, which, in all probability would be attended with the most important consequences, inasmuch as they were pretty equally matched in courage, number, and discipline. These considerations produced a treaty, for the performance of which hostages were given by Malcolm, who like∣wise<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Sax. Ing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lph.</NOTE> did homage for his possessions in Cumberland. Nevertheless, in his re∣turn through that county, he fortified Carlile for his own use; and bestowed the earldom of Northumberland upon Waltheof, after having taken it from Gospa∣tric, on pretence of his having carried on a correspondence with the rebels; that nobleman, thus deprived of his possession, retired to Scotland, where Malcolm cre∣ated him earl of Dunbar. Edgar Atheling, in consequence of the treaty concluded between England and Scotland, renounced his claim to the throne, and in the course of the ensuing year repaired to Normandy, where he was graciously received and restored to his honours by the king, who settled upon him a mark per diem for his subsistence; though such was the simplicity of this darling of the English, that he afterwards resigned his pension for a fine horse belonging to William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Philip, king of France, who envied the prosperity of William, and became jealous of the power of such a formidable vassal, resolved to cooperate with the English malecontents, in hope of seeing the conqueror still expelled from his new kingdom. During these troubles, he invaded Normandy, even without a previous declaration of war; at the same time Fulk, count of Anjou, spi∣rited up a revolt in the county of Le Maine, which William had formerly annexed to his dominions; the town and citadel of Le Mans was taken, and the Normans driven out of the country. To quell these commotions, the conquerer raised an army of English, amounting to fifty thousand, and leaving his own countrymen to guard the kingdom, landed with the others in Normandy. These being joined by a reinforcement of Normans, he took the field against the French and the revolters, and having reduced the province of Le Maine, and gained several advantages over the enemy, Philip thought proper to make advances towards an<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Sax.</NOTE> accommodation, and a peace was concluded at Bruyeres. While William resided in Normandy, Gregory VII. otherwise known by the name of Hildebrand, the most insolent pontiff that ever possessed the see of Rome, summoned him by a nuncio to do homage for the kingdom of England, as a fief of the Roman see, and to pay up the arrears of romescot or St. Peter's penny, which had been
<PB N="231" REF="2400"/>
for some years neglected. To this peremptory demand William replied that he held<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The king's long absence gave rise to a conspiracy in England, hatch∣ed by persons whom he least of all suspected of disaffection. Roger the younger son of Willian Fitzosbern, who succeeded to the English estate and earldom of Hereford, had either by way of compliment to his sovereign, or in compliance with some obligation of the feudal law, sollicited William's consent to the mar∣riage of his sister with Ralph de Guair, earl of the East-Angles. This favour was requested, and flatly refused by the king before his departure from England; but as the parties had agreed upon the articles, the ceremony was performed, and the nuptials were solemnized with great magnificence at Exning in Suffolk, where a great number of barons, bishops, and military officers, were assembled on this occasion, and among the rest Waltheof, the new created earl of Northumberland. As the parents of the new-married couple were well ac∣quainted with the character of William, who would never forgive this trans∣action, undertaken in direct opposition to his will, they took the opportu∣nity, while the guests were warmed with wine, to introduce that subject of conversation; they inveighed against the severity of William's government; they observed that, by means of his excessive impositions, he took away with one hand what he had given with the other; that this tyranny extended even to their domestic affairs, seeing he controuled them in the disposal of their sisters and daughters. They affected to express compassion for the English nation, which he had so cruelly inslaved; they inveighed against the reserve and haughtiness of his disposition; and lastly, expatiated upon the disgrace of being subjected to the arbitrary power of a bastard and usurper. By these insinuations the guests, al∣ready intoxicated with the fumes of the entertainment, were inflamed to such a degree of temerity, that they unanimousy resolved to take arms and oppose the king's return; and in the mean time determined to sollicit the assistance of Swein, king of Denmark, the professed and inveterate enemy of the Norman. Next day, when Waltheof began to reflect cooly upon the danger in which he had em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arked, he plainly perceived that whatever should happen, he must be a loser, because he and his country would suffer by the change of one arbitrary monarch for a number of petty tyrants, in case they should succeed; and he being the only Englishman engaged in the conspiracy, would be the chief aim of William's ven∣geance, provided their scheme should miscarry, as he could not help thinking it would; besides, he was influenced on this occasion by motives of gratitude to the king, who had honoured him with particular marks of confidence and favour.</P>

<P>In consequence of those suggestions, he communicated the particulars of the conspiracy to Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury; and, by the advice of that prelate, took shipping immediately for Normandy, where he made a full discovery of the plot to the king, and met with a gracious reception. William, though he had not yet intirely appeased the troubles of his hereditary dominions, no sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ived this intelligence than he set sail for England, where he found the dis∣turbance

already suppressed by the diligence of his brother Odo, whom he had left regent of the kingdom. The two chiefs of the conspiracy had taken the field with their followers, as soon as Waltheof disappeared. Roger attempted to cross the Severne, but was prevented by Wulstan, bishop of Worcester, and Ur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, high-sheriff of the county. Ralph advanced into the neighbourhood of Cambridge, and being defeated at Fagadun by Odo, and Geoffry the justiciary, the right foot of every prisoner was cut off by way of punishment. He himself escaped to his castle at Norwich<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which was immediately invested; but despair∣ing of pardon, in case he should fall into the king's hand, he found means to steal away into Denmark.

<P>William, on his return to England, had forfeited this nobleman's honours and estate in England; and condemned Roger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earl of Hereford, his own kinsman, to close imprisonment. The rest of the conspirators were either hanged, blinded, or deprived of their hands: but the fate of Waltheof was universally regretted. Notwithstanding the candour with which this noble earl had acted in this affair, and the intercession of Lanfranc, who plead∣ed his cause with the king, he was brought to his trial, upon the information of his own wife Judith; and being an Englishman possessed of a great for∣tune, and qualities that excited the jealousy of the Conqueror, he was convict∣ed of treason, and privately beheaded without the walls of Winchester. His body was at first thrown ignominiously into a ditch, where it lay a fortnight, flightly covered with earth, and was then removed to the chapter-house, at Croy∣land, where it was honourably interred. This was the last Englishman who main∣tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1075.</NOTE> any considerable power or influence in the nation. He was tall and well-proportioned; of undaunted courage and incredible bodily strength; de∣vout, generous, charitable, and exceedingly beloved: his popularity was such, that a private execution was thought necessary. He was not only bewailed by his country, but considered as a martyr, and miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb: while his widow was universally abhorred, and ended her days in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ph.

<P>The Conqueror having re-established the peace of his government, and extinguished the last embers of rebellion with blood, crossed the sea again, in order to execute his vengeance upon Ralph de Guair, against whom he marched into Bretagne, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eged the city of Dal, which, however, he could not reduce, before the king of France sent forces to its relief. When he heard of their approach, he raised the siege, and retired with such precipitation, that he left all his baggage and his tents standing. Seeing little probability of succeeding in these attempts against Hoel, count of Bretagne, who was Ralph's
<PB N="233" REF="2420"/>
protector, he set on foot a negociation with him, and a treaty was afterwards concluded at Bayeux; the principal article of which imported, that his daughter Constance should be given in marriage to Alain Fergant, Hoel's el∣dest<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Immediately after the consummation of this marriage he returned to England, where nothing remarkable happened; and he now seemed to enjoy some repose from the incessant troubles that had hitherto agitated his reign, when, all of a sudden, he was involved in family-disquiets. His eldest son Ro∣bert, surnamed, from his short legs, Gambaron, or Courtes-huses, had called upon his father, after the conquest of England, to perform the promise he had made, to leave him in possession of Normandy, as soon as the conqueror him∣self should be master of this kingdom. This promise he had made in the French council, while he was in Paris solliciting succours for his expedition from Philip; and afterwards, in a dangerous fit of illness, he renewed the promise, declared Robert heir to his hereditary dominions, and as such the barons of Nor∣mandy and Main did him homage. After having been crowned king of Eng∣land, he had delayed performance, on pretence of the numerous revolts among the English, and the invasions with which he was threatened by the Scots and Danes; but all these objections being removed, and the kingdom totall# reduc∣ed to submission, when Robert reminded him of his promise, he flatly told him he would not undress himself before he went to bed; and therefore he must wait till his decease. The son, though ambitious, brave, and enterprising, maintained such filial respect for his father, that, perhaps, he would have taken no s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep to disturb his tranquility, had not he been instigated by Ivo and Alberic, sons of Hugh de Grente Mesnil, who, having been deprived of their father's English honours and estate, were enemies to the conqueror, and let slip no opportunity to kindle a dissension between him and his eldest son. They represented to Ro∣bert, whose temper, though mild, was yet inflammable, that his father's refusal was not only an injury, but a flagrant affront; and that his intention was to share his Norman dominions between his other two sons, William Rufus and Henry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who had engrossed his whole favour. At the very time, while his mind was irritated by this remonstrance, his brothers happened, whether by accident or design, to behave rudely in his presence, and besprinkled him with some wa∣ter, which they pretended to throw at one another in jest. This boyish insult provoked Robert to such a degree, that he drew his sword, and mischief would have ensued, had not the father, who was in the neighbourhood, immediately interposed. But, he could not allay the animosity, which from this moment pre∣vailed in his family. Robert and his confederates withdrew to Rouen, in the middle of the night, hoping to surprise the castle; but his design was defeated by Roger de Ivry the governor. Thus the flame broke out, and the young Nor∣man nobility in general declared for Robert; while the king took measures for suppressing the insurrection, by giving orders to seize and punish all the parti∣sans of his rebellious son, some of whom were apprehended and imprisoned, and the rest, who fled, were deprived of their estates. The nobility of Bretagne, Anjou, and Maine, interested themselves in this quarrel, some declaring for the son, and others adhering to the father, and a sort of piratical war was maintain∣ed three or four years, with some intervals of accommodation. It was in one of these that William crossed the sea to England; and in his absence hostilities
<PB N="234" REF="2430"/>
were renewed in Normandy. Philip, king of France, envying the power and glory of William, fomented the division in secret, encouraged Robert with magnificent promises of support, and in the mean time, assisted him with the means to keep the war alive; Robert likewise received private supplies from his own mother, whose favourite he was, and he found other resources in the friend∣ship of the Norman lords, by whom he was exceedingly beloved.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="44" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>William, not a little anxious and perplexed by these domestic trou∣bles, levied a strong army of English, and transpor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed it to Normandy, where Robert being in no condition to withstand such a reinforcement, added to the Normans, who still espoused his father's cause, he demanded a safe retreat of Philip, who, being unwilling to engage himself openly in a war with the king of Eng∣land, prevailed upon the Vidame Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to admit him into Gerberoy, a strong fortress in the Beauvoisis. In this place Robert was joined by a great number of French noblemen, who went thither, with their vassals, to signalize their cou∣rage under the command of a prince who was counted one of the best soldiers of his time, and from thence they ravaged all the Vexin Norman and the Pais de Caux.</P>
<P>With a view to stop these incursions, William began his march in the depth of winter, and invested Gerberoy, the siege of which he carried on with vigour about three weeks, during which many sallies were made, and a number of signal adventures in chivalry atchieved. In one of those actions, Robert perceiving an officer of the English army, fighting on horseback with remarkable prowess and impetuosity, ran at him with his lance, wounded and dismounted him at the first encounter. The next blow would, in all probability, have put an end to his life, had not the vanquished cavalier lifted up his beaver, and displayed the individual countenance of his own father. Robert, shocked at this outrage which he had unknowingly committed against the laws of nature, immediately fell upon his knees, craved pardon with tears in his eyes, and remounted his father with his own hands; William, stung with shame and indignation, instead o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> granting the pardon he requested, is said to have cursed him with great bit∣terness. Be that as it will, he forthwith raised the siege, and returned to Rouen, where he was prevailed upon by the importunities of his queen, seconded by<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></NOTE> Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, and some Norman barons, to be reconciled to his rebellious son, whom, however, he would not trust in Normandy after his de∣parture, but brought him over to England on pretence of sending him to com∣mand an army against the Scots, who had by this time invaded England.</P>

The Scots having succeeded so well in their first incursion, were encouraged to repeat the invasion, especially as the whole county of Northumberland was involved in the utmost confusion and discord, occa∣sioned originally by the murder of Walcher, bishop of Durham. This prelate had, at the death of Waltheof, purchased the earldom of Northumberland of the king; and being a man of an easy, indolent disposition, suffered his officers to oppre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the people: he was chiefly governed by Leofwine, his chaplain, and Gi∣selbert, his kinsman and deputy, who, among other outrages, assassinated Le∣gulph, a wise, devout, and charitable nobleman, who had often advised the

bishop to discard such evil counsellors. Walcher was extremely concerned at the murder of a person whom he esteemed so much; but the perpetrators of it had gained such an ascendancy over him, that instead of surrendering them to justice, he endeavoured to compound the matter by making some satisfaction to the relations of the deceased. With that view he appeared at a county-court held at Gateshead; where the people were so incensed at his attempt to screen such atro∣cious murderers and oppressors, that they fell upon them without form of tri∣al, and hewed them in pieces; then turned their swords against the bishop, who was slain with all his followers. Thus aroused, they marched to Durham, and invested the castle; but, in a few days, were obliged to raise the siege, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1080. Flor. Wig.

Odo, chief justiciary of the kingdom, was detached with a body of troops to quell this insurrection; but, before he arrived, the mutineers had dispersed, and the principal authors of the massacre quitted the kingdom.

At his return to court, finding his father still cold and indifferent, he set out upon his travels, attended by some of his Norman adherents, and having made the tour of Europe, at last fixed his residence at the court of France, where he remained till his father's death. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>We have already seen in what manner the king had fleeced the Saxons, to gratify his own avarice; and now he thought it was high time to make his advantage also of his Norman subjects, among whom he had parcelled out all the lands in the kingdom. That he might exactly know what impositions they could bear, he resolved to procure the most minute information touching the value of his own demesnes, as well as the lands which his tenants held in ca∣pite: for this purpose, he appointed commissioners to repair to the different counties, and make a general survey of the kingdom, by the verdict of juries sworn in every hundred, wapentac, or county, who specified the extent and va∣lue of all the arable land, pasture, meadow, and wood, possessed by every indi∣vidual; and this description included the numbers of freemen,<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Socmen were tenants who held by no ser∣vile tenure, but payed their rent as a soke or sign of freedom.—Borders, or Bordarii, were cottagers, who supplied the lord of the manor with poultry and eggs.

<P>Having taken these measures to gratify his avarice, his next care was to indulge another passion no less pernicious to his subjects. He loved the chace with such fury of desire, that he depopulated the country in Hampshire, to the extent of thirty miles; turning out the inhabitants, destroying all the villages, houses, plantations, and even churches, that stood within that tract, which was reserved for the habitation of wild beasts, and distinguished by the name of the New Forest. In the time of the Saxon kings, all noblemen with∣out distinction, had a right to enjoy this diversion in countries and forests where the game abounded: but William, either with a view to gratify his own passion for hunting, without participation, or in hope of raising money from trespasses, appropriated all those forests to himself, and published very severe laws<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A person convicted of having killed a deer, hare, or wild boar, was punished with the loss of his eyes: whereas he might have atoned for murder, by a moderate fine.</NOTE> to prohibit his subjects from encroaching upon this part of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prerogative. The depopulation of the country was not more severely felt by the commons, than thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> restrictions were resented by the nobility, both Normans and English, who looked upon them as an intolerable grievance, which deprived them of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

But he paid very little regard to their murmurs, while he derived such advantages from their transgression; for they were so much addicted to hunting, that they chose to undergo all the pecuniary penalties, rather than be deprived of that ex∣ercise.</P>

<P>This was one of the few instances, in which he made no difference between Saxon and Norman. In other respects, his partiality for his native coun∣try seemed every day to increase. Though he could not, with any decency, abo∣lish the laws that were ascribed to his old friend Edward the Confessor, he in∣troduced divers alterations in the manner of administering justice. He prohi∣bited the bishops from assisting as usual at county-courts, or shire-gemots, and assigned to them a separate tribunal, on pretence of distinguishing between ci∣vil and ecclesiastical affairs; but in reality with a view to deprive the prelates of their share of the mulcts and amerciaments. He instituted new tribunals, some of which were ambulatory and followed the court, to the great inconvenience of the parties; and in these courts the proceedings were carried on in the Norman lan∣guage, for the attainment of which he erected schools in all the towns and bur∣roughs of the kingdom, commanding all parents to send their children to these seminaries, under severe penalties. He ordered the laws to be published in the Norman tongue; and at court no other was ever heard. William's intention was to supplant the Saxon with his own vernacular language; but all his efforts miscarried; the mixture of the two produced a third, which was different from either, and yet had affinity with both. The English were not only robbed of

<P>Odo, bishop of Bayeux, the king's uterine brother, after having re∣sided fifteen or sixteen years in England, amassed so much treasure that he re∣solved to purchase the papacy. In the mean time he bought a sumptuous pa∣lace at Rome, in which he proposed to live till the death of the present incum∣bent, that he might be at hand to secure the succession. He took all his mea∣sures with the utmost secrecy, and even persuaded Hugh, earl of Chester, to∣gether with a great number of his adherents and tenants, to follow him into Italy, where he would improve their fortunes under the shadow of St. Peter's chair. Having concerted all his measures for the execution of this project, he took the opportunity of the king's absence to equip a vessel at the Isle of Wight, where he proposed to embark: but while he was detained by contrary winds, William received intimation of his design, and resolving to prevent the exportation of so much treasure from his dominions, crossed the sea in person, and surprised him just as he was stepping on board: when he ordered his atten∣dants to arrest Odo, they were afraid of attaching the person of a prelate; so that William was obliged to seize him with his own hand. Odo appealed to the pope, who, he said, was the only person upon earth, who had power to try a bishop; and the king replied, that he did not seize him as bishop of Bayeux, but as earl of Kent, in which capacity he should give an account of his admi∣nistration. Mean while he confiscated his effects, and ordered him to be trans∣ported to Normandy, and imprisoned in the castle of Rouen, where he remain∣ed till the death of the conqueror, notwithstanding all the efforts of pope Gre∣gory, who soothed and threatened William by turns in his behalf. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Immediately after this transaction, William lost his queen Mathilda, who died of a lingering disorder, after having been his consort three and thirty years; and he was so exceedingly afflicted at her death, that he ever after ab∣stained from his usual recreations. In the midst of his sorrow at this event, he was alarmed by an insurrection in Le Maine, the nobility of which had been al∣ways averse to the Norman government. Hubert vicomte de Beaumont, disgust∣ed by some treatment he had received from the conqueror, retired to his castle of Susanne, which, in those days, was counted impregnable, and from thence made incursions into Le Maine, ravaging the country and surprising de∣tached parties of the Norman garrisons. The king marched immediately to his fortress, which he found so strong, that he did not think proper to besiege it in¦form; but erected a fort in the neighbourhood, in which he left a garrison, to check the viscount's incursions, under the command of his son-in-law Alain Fregnant, who was at first superior to the enemy. Hubert, however, in the sequel, was joined with such a number of friends and allies from France and Burgundy, as enabled him to insult the Normans at the very gate of their fort, and maintain the war for three years, during which he obtained several advan∣tages over William's troops, and at length obtained a complete victory. The king finding it impracticable to reduce him by force, offered to be reconciled to him if he would return to his duty; and Hubert, being furnished with a safe conduct, repaired to England, where he was graciously received by the Con∣queror, who re-established him in the possession of all his father's estate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">O d.

<P>Perhaps this war would not have continued so long had not William's presence been necessary in England, to provide against an invasion with which he was threatened by the king of Denmark. The English refugees in that country had assured Canute, that their countrymen wanted nothing but an op∣portunity to shake off the Norman yoke; and that prince believed this was a fa∣vourable conjuncture for the conquest of England, to the crown of which he had some pretensions. He therefore equipped a powerful armament, and Wil∣liam being apprized of his design, brought over an army of foreigners from the continent, because he could not confide in the fidelity of his English subjects. At the same time he imposed a tax of six shillings upon every hide of land, which was three times the amount of the ordinary Danegelt, and supposing the Danes would make their descent in the north, he ordered the whole province of Northumberland to be laid waste, that they might find no subsistance at their arrival. Canute being informed of these precautions, desisted from his enter∣prize; and William hearing he had laid aside the design, disbanded his forces: but the money raised for their maintenance was never restored.

<P>William found no difficulty in saddling his subjects with any in∣cumbrances they could bear: he was now as absolute as a Persian emperor; and had nothing to do but speak and be obeyed. The Normans knew their possessions depended entirely upon his pleasure; and the English were so effectu∣ally crushed, that almost every nobleman of that nation was executed, impri∣soned, or exiled. Those very few who still breathed their native air, and en∣joyed habitations of their own, were so much exposed to the watchful jealousy of the king, that their liberty and lives existed on the most precarious tenure. Edgar Atheling, though there was nothing formidable in his talents, and nothing enterprising in his genius, was still the object of William's fear and suspicion, because he saw that prince, even in the low state of dependency to which he had reduced him, caressed by his subjects, on account of his birth, as well as of the amiable qualities of his mind and person. Edgar, with the small share of discernment he possessed, could plainly perceive the dangerous predicament in which he stood, and therefore desired permission to go and serve as a vo∣lunteer against the infidels in Palestine. Nothing could be more agreeable than this request to the conqueror, who not only applauded his zeal for the christian religion, but supplied him with money to defray the expence of his voyage; and he departed without delay, accompanied by two hundred English gentlemen, who, having lost their estates in England, resolved to try their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE> fortune abroad.</P>

<P>William being thus rid of all apprehension of rivalship, and still eager to augment his own power and territory, revived the pretensions he had to the Vexin Francois, which had been ceded to his father by Henry, king of France, as a recompence for the assistance he had granted to that prince in his distresses. When the Duke of Normandy died in the Holy land, Philip, the successor of Henry, took advantage of William's minority, and the troubles which broke out in Normandy, to seize and appropriate to himself this territory, which the hurry of the conqueror's more interesting affairs had hither∣to

Perhaps as he was now in the decline of life, and much incommoded by corpulency, he might have allowed his title to lie dor∣mant for the rest of his reign, had it not been roused by several petty inci∣dents, which irritated the two monarchs against each other. Henry, the youngest son of the conqueror, is said to have quarrelled at chess with Lewis surnamed the Gross, Philip's eldest son, whom he wounded with the board, during a visit to the French king, who then resided at Confians St. Honorine, from whence Henry and his brother escaped by the swiftness of their horses. Philip resented this violence, though his own son had been the aggressor, and ordered his troops in garrison at Mante to cross the Eure and ravage Norman∣dy: so that William resolved to retort these depredations; but, in the mean time, he began, by the advice of his physicians, to undergo a course of medicines for the reduction of his unwieldy bulk. Philip, being made acquainted with this circumstance, scoffingly asked one day in public, if the good woman of England was still in the straw: and this sarcasm being reported to William, he sent a message to the French king, giving him notice that he would soon be a-foot; and at his churching present him with such a number of lights <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the custom of those days, in which women presented wax tapers at the al∣tar, upon their being churched after lying∣in.</NOTE>, as would make his kingdom too hot for his residence.</P>

<P>In order to perform this promise, he levied a strong army, and enter∣ing the Isle of France, destroyed and burned all the villages and houses without opposition: then investing Mante, which he took by assault, the town was plun∣dered, and with all the churches and monasteries reduced to ashes. Before the flames were extinguished William entered in triumph, and his horse chancing to place his forefeet on some hot ashes, plunged with such violence, that the ri∣der was thrown forward, and bruised upon the pummel of the saddle to such a<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmesh. Ord. Vital. An. Ch. 1086.</NOTE> degree, that he suffered a relapse, and was obliged to return to Rouen. There he was attended by Gilbert, bishop of Lysieux, and Goulard, abbot of Jumi∣eges, the most skilful physicians of the time; but notwithstanding all their en∣deavours, his distemper gained ground; and they at last gave him to un∣derstand that his end approached. Finding he could no longer enjoy the fruits of his usurpation, he resolved to compound with heaven for all the blood he had shed, and the injustice he had committed; and distributed great part of the treasure he had amassed, in alms to the poor, and benefac∣tions to churches and monasteries, particularly to those of Mante, which he had so lately destroyed. Then he settled his last will, in which he bequeath∣ed Normandy and Le Maine, to his eldest son Robert, whom he hated; but he saw there was no other method to preserve the peace of his hereditary domi∣nions. To Henry he left five thousand pounds sterling and his mother's join∣ture, without one acre of territory; and though he would not pretend to esta∣blish the succession of England, which he had usurped and oppressed in such a cruel manner, he expressed his wish that the crown might devolve to his favour∣ite son William, whom he immediately dispatched with letters to archbishop Lanfranc, solliciting that prelate's interest in his behalf. To the abbey of St. Stephen at Caen, he presented his crown and sceptre, the precious stone cha∣lice, the golden candlestics and other regalia used at his coronation; and gave
<PB N="240" REF="2490"/>
order for releasing the earls Morcar, Roger, Siward son of Beorn, and Wulnoth brother to Harold, who had been an hostage and prisoner since the reign of Ed∣ward the Confessor. He was not so favourably inclined towards Odo, bishop of Bayeux; for when his brother, count of Mortain, interceded in his behalf, William observed, that he should do an injustice to mankind, in setting at li∣berty that prelate, whom he knew to be a turbulent, ambitious churchman, cruel, vindictive, profligate, and rapacious: nevertheless, he yielded to Robert's importunities, and ordered the bishop to be enlarged, though he prognosticated abundance of mischief as the consequence of his liberty. The conqueror, when he had thus regulated his temporal affairs, was conveyed in a litter to Hermentrude, a village near Rouen, where he might settle the concerns of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1087.</NOTE> soul without noise or disturbance; and there he resigned his breath, in the sixty∣first year of his age, after having reigned two and fifty in Normandy, and one and twenty in England.</P>

<P>His body was deposited in a church at Caen, which he himself had founded; and, his two elder sons being absent, Henry superintended the funeral, which was far from being magnificent, and attended with a very remarkable incident. The corps being carried into the church of St. Stephen, and the service begun, one Ascelin Fitz-Arthur, a Vavasor, pressing through the crowd, and standing upon a high stone, called with a loud voice to the prelates that were in attendance, forbidding them to inter the body in that place, which was the area of his father's house, unjustly seized by the conqueror, whom he now sum∣moned before the divine tribunal to answer for that act of oppression.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM RUFUS was overtaken by the news of his father's death, while he waited for a favourable wind at Witsand; but this event he thought proper to conceal in England, until he had taken measures for securing the crown. Perhaps he might have found more difficulty in ascend∣ing the throne, had Robert been present to avail himself of his right of primo∣geniture; for William was hated both by Normans and English, on account of his ferocious disposition. However, he owed his sudden elevation to the credit of Lanfranc, and the attachment of Eudes, high treasurer, who not on∣ly made sure of Dover, Winchester, Pevensey, Hastings, and other fortified places, but also delivered into his hands the riches of the Conqueror, amounting to sixty thousand pounds sterling in money, besides plate and jewels to a great value. Part of this treasure he distributed among the churches and monasteries, according to the late king's intention and devisal, in order to attach the clergy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel. Brcmpton. Hoved. E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mer.</NOTE> to his interest, and part he bestowed in largesses upon the soldiery. As it was found necessary to anticipate any designs that might be formed by Robert's par∣tisans, the archbishop of Canterbury exerted all his influence in favour of Wil∣liam, and having previously sounded the individuals, assembled the majority of the bishops and nobility at Westminster, where the ceremony of his coronation
<PB N="243" REF="2520"/>
was performed, about eighteen days after his father's death. In the beginning of his reign, the English nation began to believe themselves happily disap∣pointed in their expectation of Rufus, who had hitherto discovered a most bru∣tal disposition; for he now seemed to pay the utmost regard to the councils of Lanfranc, which were mild and wholesome, and altogether calculated for the advantage of the nation. This conduct however was no more than a cloak, with which he disguised, for the present, all the bad qualities of his father, which he possessed without any of his virtues, except courage, if a savage ferocity deserves that appellation.</P>

<P>Robert received the tidings of his father's decease at Abbeville, from whence he forthwith repaired to Rouen, and took possession of Normandy with∣out opposition. This prince was the reverse of William in every thing but courage, in which and military capacity he yielded to no warrior of his time. He was open, generous, and humane, even to an excess that became criminal and pernicious; for he impoverished himself to gratify the avarice of his adhe∣rents, and bestowed the most considerable governments of the province upon noblemen whose fidelity he had reason to suspect. Morcard and Ulnoth, whom Henry had detained in prison, notwithstanding the Conqueror's orders, Robert immediately enlarged, together with Duncan, the natural son of Malcolm, king of Scotland, who had been taken in the course of the war between the two nations.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Odo, bishop of Bayeux, became his chief counsellor; but not con∣tented with the favour of the duke of Normandy, he repaired to England, in or∣der to sollicit the restitution of his estate in that country, which William had confiscated. He not only succeeded in this suit, but also ingratiated himself with William Rufus, whom, he nevertheless, resolved to depose. He took um∣brage at the credit of Lanfranc, whom he mortally hated for having advised the Conqueror to prevent his journey to Rome; and he longed to raise Robert to the throne of England, because in this event he laid his account with being prime minister. He communicated his design to some Norman lords, who had estates upon the continent as well as in England, and thought they held them on a very precarious tenure under different sovereigns, whereas an union of the two countries under one king would secure their property in both. This considera∣tion, added to the right of primogeniture and the liberality of Robert, easily determined them in his favour; while the English noblemen, who were so de∣pressed and desperate in their fortunes, saw nothing but advantage to themselves in such a change; and therefore willingly engaged in the conspiracy. Odo's in∣trigues being attended with such success, he sent an account of his negociation to Robert, assuring him that nothing was wanted but his presence, and a body of Norman troops, for the recovery of the English crown, from which he had been so unjustly excluded. Robert was extremely well pleased with this intel∣ligence, in consequence of which he borrowed a sum of money from his brother Henry, on a mortgage of the Contantin; then assured his uncle he would not fail to be in England with all expedition, and in the mean time desired he would prepare his friends for an open revolt. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE></P>

<P>The conspirators of England trusting to this assurance, began forth∣with to put themselves in motion. Bath, Berkley, and Bristol, were secured by
<PB N="244" REF="2530"/>
the bishop of Coutance and his nephew Mowbray. Roger Bigod rose in Nor∣folk; Hugh de Grentesmesnil made himself master of the strong places in Leicestershire. The county of Worcester was occupied by Roger de Montgo∣mery, William bishop of Durham, Bernard de Newarck, Roger Lacy, and Ralph Mortimer; and, in a word, such steps were taken for Robert's interest in different parts of England, that in all probability William would have been dethroned, if Robert's indolence had not defeated all their measures. That prince, instead of employing his money in levies to support his friends in Eng∣land, squandered it away in idle expence and unrequited benefits; and procrasti∣nated his departure until the opportunity was lost: while William exerted him∣self with incredible activity to sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the confederacy, before his elder brother could arrive.</P>

<P>Lanfranc advised him on this occasion to conciliate the affection of the English; and he accordingly amused them with magnificent promises, to ease them of their burthensome tolls and taxes, and allow them free liberty of hunting. Cajoled by these professions, which were void of all sincerity, the English in general continued firmly attached to his interest, and the Londoners raised an army of thirty thousand men for his service. All the prelates and clergy, influ∣enced by the archbishop, adhered to his cause; and Lanfranc found means to detach some of the most powerful conspirators from the enterprize they had undertaken. So that, in a little time, Rusus was enabled to send a strong squa∣dron of ships to sea, while he marched at the head of his English army, against his uncle Odo, who had fortified himself at Pevensey, in hope of being relieved by the arrival of the duke of Normandy. The king invested the place and carried on his attacks with such fury, that the bishop, afraid of its being taken by assault, began in a few days to capitulate; but could obtain no terms, until he undertook to put William in possession of Rochester, to which the principal conspirators had retired, under the command of Eustace, count of Boulogne. The bishop being conducted to the gate of Rochester, in order to persuade the governor to surrender, the count perceived in his countenance how much his heart was at variance with his tongue, and took him prisoner without ceremony, as a traytor who had betrayed the confederates. William, thus baf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the craft of the bishop, undertook the siege of that city, which was so<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1088.</NOTE> vigorously defended, that he began to despair of success; when an infectious d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stemper having crept into the place, made such havoc among the garrison, that the chiefs were fain to surrender on condition of being allowed to retire with their horses only, though without any prospect of retrieving their forfeited estates. Odo found a welcome reception in Normandy, and governed that dutchy as prime minister to Robert, who, instead of repairing into England with a strong body of Norman forces, according to the original design of this con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piracy, had indulged his natural sloth at Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and sent over a single ves∣sel<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

After the reduction of Rochester, the king marched towards Durham, to chastise the bishop, who had embarked in the plot; and that city being immediately taken, the prelate was banished, together with all those who had taken up arms in the execution of this project.</P>

<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The suppre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on of this revolt confirmed the government of William Rufus, who, far from performing his promises to the English, by whose valour
<PB N="245" REF="2540"/>
and fidelity his throne was established, gave a loose to his arbitrary nature, which he had hitherto bridled, and loaded them with the most grievous impositions. Nay, in the very article of hunting, instead of abating the rigour of the law, he made a new act, by which a man convicted of killing a deer was punishable with death; and introduced the method of lawing or maiming dogs, by which the people were effectually debarred of that diversion. Archbishop Lanfranc saw with regret these examples of his tyranny and breach of faith; upon which he took the liberty to remonstrate in the most gentle manner, and in particualr to remind him of the promise he had made: but William was incensed at the freedom of his expostulation, and from that instant the prelate's interest declin∣ed; though he did not long survive his disgrace; and, when he died, was re∣gretted by both nations, as a priest of extraordinary merit. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Such was the credit of Lanfranc, that William, rather than run the risque of incurring his displeasure, had, as we have already observed, put a re∣straint upon his behaviour; but now being rid of that troublesome censor, he in∣dulged all his vicious appetites, and oppressed the people with intolerable exac∣tions, in which the clergy bore their share of oppression. He ordered a new sur∣vey to be taken of all the lands and property of the kingdom; and wherever he found them undervalued in the Doomsday-book, he raised the proportion of taxes accordingly. The inventor and executor of all these grievances was one Ralf Flambard, son of a presbyter of Bayeux, who had raised himself to a place in the great council, as well as to the favour and countenance of the king, by making himself subservient to that prince's tyranny and rapaciousness; but, in proportion as he acquired the protection and friendship of the king, he attracted the odium and resentment of the people; and at length a scheme was formed for his destruction. One Gerold, a bold enterprising man, decoyed him into a boat, on pretence of bringing him to the house of Maurice, bishop of Lon∣don, whose chaplain he had been; and conveyed him on board of a ship, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> weighed anchor immediately, and put to sea. Two men were provided to assas∣sinate this unpopular minister; but before they could perpetrate their purpose, the ship had well nigh perished in a storm; a circumstance which, in those superstitious times, was looked upon as an interposition of heaven in Ralf's be∣half. He did not fail to make the most of this occurrence, and being endow∣ed with a great share of eloquence and insinuation, prevailed upon Gerold to set him safe on shore; he immediately sent for a guard from the next station of soldiers, and, returning in triumph to London, resumed his place in the king's favour and affection. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>The miscarriage of this conspiracy against the minister, did not deter the subjects so much, but that sevèral prelates and noblemen, incensed at Wil∣liam's arbitrary proceedings, engaged in another design against the tyrant: but this project was frustrated almost as soon as hatched, by the minister's gaining over some of the principal accomplices, and banishing others, one of whom was Ivo Tai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ebois, upon whose credit all their hopes of success had depended.</P>

<P>This plot seems to have owed its original to the resentment of the clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingulph.</NOTE> whom the king fleeced without justice or remorse; inventing a new method of amassing money, which had never been practised by any of his predecessors. He not only seized the annates or first fruits of vacant benefices, but kept them in
<PB N="24$" REF="2550"/>
his own hands for a series of years together; and after he had pillaged a diocese in this manner, sold it to the best bidder, without the least regard to the morals or capacity of the purchaser. At the death of Lanfranc, he appropriated the temporalities of the archbishopric to his own use, for the term of four years; and acted in the same manner with respect to the see of Lincoln, and all others that chanced to be vacated during his reign; without regarding the complaints which were made to the pope by the clergy. Indeed this was a very favourable conjuncture for his exercising these acts of oppression with impunity, because the church was divided by a schism, and Urban II. too much engrossed by his pro∣ject<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> for a crusade, to intermeddle in such disputes.</P>

<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>William's avarice was insatiate and his revenge implacable; not con∣tented with having defrauded Robert of his birthright, he now resolved to de∣prive him of what he possessed. He was a stranger to the ties of natural affection, and hated his brother for the attempt he had made upon the English throne. Finding his government firmly established at home, he began to make prepara∣tions for invading his father's hereditary dominions, and landed in Normandy before his brother had the least intimation of his design; he therefore found him altogether unprovided for his reception, and took St. Valery, Albemarle, and some other places, without the least resistance. In this emergency Robert had reccurse to the king of France, who marched in person at the head of an army to his assistance; but he reaped very little advantage from these allies. William found means to detach Philip from the duke's interest, and that monarch retired, leaving Robert more than ever exposed to the calamities of war; for he had trusted so much to the French succours, that he took no other measures for his own defence. William continued to make himself master of one place after ano∣ther, and even carried on a secret negotiation with Conon, governor of Rouen, who promised to put him in possession of that city; and the duke was on the brink of destruction, when he prevailed upon his younger brother Henry to use those arms as his friend, which he had actually taken up as his enemy. That prince was incensed against Robert, because he had seized the Contantin, which was mortgaged to him for the money he advanced towards the English expedition; and even refused to pay the debt. Henry had assembled some troops to do him∣self justice; but the duke imploring his assistance, and promising faithfully to dis∣charge the obligation, he espoused his quarrel, entered Rouen unexpectedly, seized Conon, whom he ordered to be thrown headlong from the top of a tower, and took possession of the city for his elder brother. William thus baffled by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1091.</NOTE> union of Robert and Henry, made advances towards an accommodation; and peace was concluded, on condition that Robert should cede to the king the county of Eu, Fescamp, Cherbourg, and all the other places which he had reduced on the coast of Normandy; that William should assist the duke in subduing the province of Maine, which had revolted; restore the confiscated English estates of<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or. de Wor.

<P>How pleased so ever the king and the duke might be with the articles of this treaty, Henry was extremely disgusted, inasmuch as no regard was paid to his interest; and Robert did not seem inclined to keep his promise touching the payment of the money he had borrowed. Incensed at these instances of disrepect, he resolved

to take satisfaction by force of arms, and accordingly made himself master of Mont Michel by surprise. Robert, unwilling to lose a place of such importance, prevailed upon William to aid him in reducing the castle, which was situated on an inaccessible rock washed by the sea, and twice a day quite surrounded with the tide. While the two brothers lay before this fortress, which they could besiege no other way but by a blockade, William taking the air one day a horseback, at some distance from the camp, perceived two horsemen riding out from the castle, and obeying the dictates of his impetuosity, attacked them with great fury; but, his horse being killed in the first encounter, overturned and lay upon him in such a manner, that he could not disengage himself. His antagonist, while he remained in this situation, had lifted up his hand in order to deprive him of his life, when he exclaimed in a menacing tone, "Hold, villain, I am the king of England." The two cavaliers were immediately seized with veneration and awe, and helping him up, accommodated him with one of their horses. William springing into the saddle; "Follow me (said he to his conqueror) I will reward thy valour; and thou shalt henceforth be my knight." Mean while the siege advanced very slow∣ly, and indeed the place seemed to be impregnable; when Henry, being reduced to a great scarcity of sweet-water, desired his brother Robert would send him a sup∣ply, and conquer him by arms rather than by thirst. The duke, whose generous temper he was well acquainted with, complied immediately with his request, by allowing the garrison to fetch as much water as they found necessary; and at the same time he sent a pipe of wine for his brother's own drinking. Rufus did not at all approve of this generosity, which he ascribed to the folly of Robert, who justified his conduct by observing that the quarrel between them and Henry was not such as ought to destroy the bands of natural affection, and that they might yet live to have occasion for a brother's assistance. After a tedious siege the castle was at last surrendered; and Henry retired to Bretagne, from whence he wandered about for two years, almost destitute of attendants, and sometimes in want of subsistence. At this period too, Edgar Atheling, who had returned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ibid.</NOTE> from Palestine, was ordered to quit Normandy, and forbid to enter England at his peril; so that he withdrew into Scotland, where he always met with a favourable reception.</P>

<P>During William's absence from his kingdom, Malcolm the Scottish monarch invading England, ravaged the county of Northumberland; and the people of the north, complaining loudly of their being exposed to such cala∣mities, from the king's leaving his dominions, Rufus returned with all expedi∣tion, and prevailed upon Robert to accompany him in his campaign against the Scot. The troops being immediately assembled, they advanced against the enemy, who retired as they approached as far as Scot-water, where they received a message from Malcolm, importing that he had nothing to offer to William except a bat∣tle; but, he was ready to do homage as prince of Cumberland to Robert, as the eldest son of William the Conqueror. This address occasioned a council of war, in which it was judged expedient to offer propositions of peace, as the army was greatly diminished, and dispirited by sickness, fatigue, and scarcity of pro∣vision, and the fleet dispersed and mostly destroyed by a tempest. Robert, there∣fore, repaired with a few attendants to the Scottish camp, where he was hospitably entertained; and Malcolm assured him that his army was raised with a view to make a diversion in his favour when he was at variance with William; but now

Thus, by the mediation of Robert, peace was con∣cluded between England and Malcolm, who was confirmed in the possession of Cumberland, for which he did homage, and received an annual gratification of twelve marks of gold.

While he took these measures for paving the way to the conquest of Normandy, he exercised his authority at home, in devising new taxes upon corporations, by which he filled his coffers, and intailed upon himself the hatred and curses of the people, Normans as well as Saxons; for he spunged them without distinction.</P>

<P>They at length flattered themselves that heaven had heard their prayers, as the king was seized with a dangerous distemper at Gloucester.

He even promised to amend his life, and correct the errors of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s government, should he have the good fortune to recover his health. The bishops in attendance did not neglect this precious opportunity of exhorting him to fill the vacant bene∣fices; and he was so meekened by the apprehension of death, that he immediately complied with their admonitions. Robert Bloet, one of his counsellors, was promoted to the bishoprie of Lincoln, and the see of Canterbury was bestowed upon An∣selm, abbot of Bec in Normandy, who chanced to be at the English court, and could hardly be prevailed upon to accept the dign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty under the reign of such an arbitrary prince; but, before he would allow himself to be consecrated, he insisted upon the king's restoring all that he had wrested from the church of Canterbury since the death of Lanfranc; and Rufus promised faithfully to make restitution.</P>

profligacy with redoubled relish; his government was the exertion of the most des∣potic power, manifested in all shapes of extortion and violence. Justice was banished from the tribunals, which were filled with venal and corrupted judges, who pur∣sued no other aim than that of enriching themselves with the spoils of the people. All governors and persons in office seemed to have been appointed for plunder∣ing, not protecting the subject; the public money stuck to the hands of those who managed it; all honours and rewards were engrossed by panders, parasites, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Huntingdon.

<P>William's insolence and perfidy were felt by all mankind, so far as they were concerned with him either as friends or enemies. Malcolm, having by his ambassadors demanded the performance of the articles in the late treaty, touching the lands of Cumberland to be ceded in his favour, he desired the Scot∣tish king would come in person to his court of Gloucester, where he should have justice. Malcolm went thither accordingly, and was received in a very im∣perious manner by Rufus, who gave him to understand that he must submit his cause to the determination of the English peers: a tribunal which the Scot rejected with disdain, proposing in his turn that the dispute should be determined by the nobility of both kingdoms assembled on the borders, according to antient custom. William would not submit to this equitable proposal; the treaty was renounced, and Malcolm returned to his own country, glowing with indignation at the indig∣nities he had undergone.</P>

<P>Tho' this prince left several children of his own, his brother Donald mounted the throne, and expelled all the English whom the late king had so remarkably favoured; among which number was Edgar Atheling, who re∣tired to England with his nephews the sons of Malcolm. Donald's next care was to assemble an army and revenge his brother's death: in the latter end of summer he made an irruption into England, and laid waste the country with fire and sword. Rufus, being informed of these ravages, sent a body of troops against him, under the command of Duncan, natural son of Malcolm, who then resided at the English court, and had been knighted by Robert, duke of Nor∣mandy. As he advanced, Donald withdrew into Scotland, but was so closely pur∣sued, that he was obliged to hazard a battle, though greatly inferior in number to the English, by whom he was routed, and compelled to fly to the western isles for shelter. Duncan, by means of this victory, ascended the throne with the consent of the people; but, as he retained an English guard about his person, the Scots were so incensed at this mark of his partiality to foreigners, that they surprized and put them all to the sword. Duncan, who thought this conspiracy was aimed at his own person, fled with great precipitation; but was recalled by his sub∣jects, and replaced upon the throne, on condition that he should not for the future bring any strangers into Scotland: he was afterwards murdered by Malpeit, earl<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.</NOTE> of Merns, at the instigation of Donald, who resumed the reins of government.</P>

<P>William Rufus, being freed from a very powerful and dangerous ene∣my in the person of Malcolm, found himself at leisure to invade the territories of his own brother Robert, who, tired of the frivolous excuses he made for delaying the execution of the treaty, at length sent over ambassadors to insist upon the immediate performance of the articles, or in case of his refusal to fulfil them without loss of time, to denounce a war against him as a perjured prince. Wil∣liam, instead of complying with this peremptory demand, rejected it with disdain, and invaded Normandy with a powerful armament: however, that he might have some colour for the hostilities he intended to commit, he proposed an interview with Robert, to whom he made some proposals that the other did not think equi∣table. A second conference was opened in presence of all the barons, who had witnessed and sworn to guarantee the treaty; but, this proved as fruitless as the former, because William went over, not with a design to effect an accommoda∣tion, but to make a conquest of the dukedom. Hostilities immediately com∣menced, and several towns were reduced by Rufus, who began to congratulate himself on the near prospect of adding Normandy to his other dominions, when the king of France, unwilling to have such a troublesome neighbour, marched with an army to the assistance of Robert, and the scene was immediately changed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>We have already seen how Robert Fitzhamon, earl of Gloucester, had taken possession of Glamorganshire, after having slain the ungrateful Testyn. At the same time Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, reduced Montgomery; and his son Arnulph, having obtained a grant of Pembrokeshire from the king, took possession, and built the castles of Pembroke, Cardigan, and other fortresses, to secure his acquisition. The Welch, however, exasperated at these encroach∣ments fell upon them in all quarters, and expelled the Normans from all these settlements but Pembroke castle, which they could not reduce: they took Mont∣gomery by assault, and put the garrison to the sword; then over-running the coun∣ties of Chester, Salop, and Hereford, they ravaged and burned the whole coun∣try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Powel.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>These devastations brought over William from Normandy, who marching directly against the invaders, entered their country, and repaired the castle of Montgomery; but the Welch, instead of hazarding a battle, retired to their woods and mountains, from whence they surprised his parties occasionally, and put them to the sword; so that he was obliged to return with disgrace. He afterwards repeated the attempt with the same want of success, and perceiving that he should never be able to subdue them by the operations of a regular campaign, he ordered the wardens of the marches to encroach upon them by degrees, and maintain their intrusions with strong castles. Indeed his second expedition was relinquished on account of receiving intelligence of the revolt of Robert Mowbray, who, being elated with the victory over the Scots at Al∣newick, obtained by his forces, thought the king could never sufficiently re∣compence him for this important service. William, whose soul was a stranger to gratitude or liberality, paid very little regard to his merit.; and Mowbray re∣solved to take vengeance upon him for his neglect, by removing him from the throne, and setting the crown upon Stephen, count of Albemarle, the Con∣queror's nephew. In this design he had found means to engage a great number of malecontent noblemen; and their measure; were kept so secret, that the king did not receive intimation of the plot, until he had entered Wales.</P>

<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">

<P>He forthwith changed the object of his enterprize, and directed his march against Mowbray, who had fortified the castle of Bamburg. In his rout he must have fallen into an ambuscade prepared by the revolters, had not Richard de Tunbridge, who was concerned in the scheme, repented of his trea∣son, and warned William of the danger. When he arrived at Bamburg he found it impregnable, from the nature of it's situation; and, turning the siege into a blockade, erected a fortress called Mauvoisin, or Bad neighbour, so near it as to prevent supplies of provisions from being carried to the besieged; and hav∣ing furnished this new fort with a strong garrison, retired with the rest of his ar∣my. In the course of this blockade, Robert formed a scheme for surprising Newcastle; but his motions were so narrowly watched by the troops in Mauvoi∣sin, that instead of carrying his point, he was forced to fly to the monastery of St. Oswin, at Tinmouth, in which he and all his officers were taken, after a des∣perate

Morel, his kinsman and confidant, still defended Bamburg, until Robert being brought before the gate with a message to the governor and Mowbray's countess, who was in the place, importing that his eyes should be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Morel saved his life by making a fuil discovery of the conspiracy, in consequence of which a great number of unhappy people were punished with great severity. Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury, purchased his pardon with the sum of three thousand pounds: Ro∣ger de Lacy making his escape into France, his lands were confiscated and be∣stowed upon his brother Eu, who had continued faithful to the king; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

The lists were accordingly enclosed, the day and judges appointed: the duel was fought at Salisbury, and the count being vanquished, it was decreed that he should lose his eyes, and be deprived of his virility. His kinsman William de Alderi being convicted at the same time, was sentenced to be hanged; and declared at the place of execution, that as he hoped for mercy at the hands of God, he was entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge; and he was credited by the majority of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> nation.</P>

<P>William had no sooner destroyed the roots of this conspiracy, than he found himself involved in a disagreeable quarrel with Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, who was too scrupulously attached to the immunities and dignity of the church; and was indeed a prelate of a very haughty disposition. He ac∣knowledged Urban II. as lawful pope, though he knew that the king inclined towards Clement; and a law had been enacted during the preceding reign, to prohibit all persons from acknowledging any pope without the king's consent. Anselm pretended that the king had no right to intermeddle in church affairs: but William, far from subscribing to this doctrine, began to treat him so roughly, that he des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed permission to retire to Rome: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s request was at first denied, but afterwards granted; though Rufus, in order to mortify the prelate, sent an offi∣cer to search his baggage, after he was on board, and seize all his money, on pre∣tence of the law which forbad the exportation of silver. Immediately after An∣selm's departure, he appropriated to his own use the temporalities of the see, which he enjoyed all the remaining part of his life; while the exasperated pre∣late<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.

<P>Urban's attention was too much engrossed with the execution of the crusade, to interest himself in such unimportant disputes. His scheme was to rescue the Holy land from the dominion of the Saracens; a romantic scheme, with which he was infected by a fanatic friar, known by the name of Peter the Hermit.

who glowed with ambition to distinguish himself in an expedition upon which the eyes of all Europe were turned. As he wanted money to defray the ne∣cessary expence, he had recourse to his brother William, of whom he proposed to borrow ten thousand marks of gold, on a mortgage of his dukedom. Ru∣fus lent a willing ear to his proposal; but his kingdom being already too much exhausted by unconscionable exactions, he bethought himself of another expe∣dient, which succeeded to his wish. He applied for a loan to the richest of his subjects, secular as well as ecclesiastic; and his request having all the air of a commandment, they generally complied, though not without murmur∣ing. A few people, who pleaded poverty, were compelled to find what was demanded of them; and many ecclesiastics, on pretence of indigence, melted down the plate of their churches and monasteries, in order to supply his occa∣sions. Having in this manner amassed the necessary sum, he made a voyage to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.</NOTE> Normandy, of which he took possession for the term of five years, according to the agreement with his brother, who, being thus supplied, set out on the crusade to Asia Minor, and was present at the reduction of Nice, Antioch, and Jerusalem, on which occasions he signalized his valour, conduct, and mi∣litary skill, above all the princes that embarked in the expedition.</P>

<P>Immediately after the duke's departure, William, as mortgagee of Normandy, demanded of the king of France, the French part of the Vexin, which, he pretended, was an appurtenance of the dutchy; and Philip's refusal was attended with a war, which produced no remarkable transaction, and was in a little time terminated by a treaty. Rufus, on his return to England, made ano∣ther attempt upon Wales, in full resolution to exterminate all the males of that nation; but he was again foiled, and obliged to desist from his design. The next expedition he undertook was of a more laudable nature: at least, if he did not personally engage in the undertaking, he permitted Edgar Atheling to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>He gave orders for rebuilding London-Bridge, which had been de∣molished by torrents; for surrounding the Tower with a strong wall and ram∣part; and for erecting the structure of Westminster-hall, which, though one of the largest in Europe, he, on his return from Normandy, affected to despise as a petty bed-chamber. During his residence on the continent, he had endea∣voured ineffectually to recover Le Maine by force of arms from Helie de la Fleche, who had seized that province, on pretence of some agreement with Ro∣bert before he set out for Palestine. The Manceaux declared for La Fleche, and guarded their passes in such a manner, that William could not enter their country; so that a kind of pyratical war was maintained, until William's general, Robert Belesme, had the good fortune to take Helie in an ambus∣cade. The king having secured this enterprising officer at Rouen, raised a great army of Bretons, Flemings, Burgundians, Normans, and English, in hope of reducing the province, without farther opposition: but, he met with a formidable antagonist in the person of Fulk Rechen, count of Anjou, of whom Helie held the county in vassalage, and was obliged to have recourse to an expedient, which he had practised with success on other occasions. In a word, he purchased a treaty of peace, by which he was restored to the posses∣sion of Le Maine, in consideration of setting Helie at liberty, with all the pri∣soners he had taken. The town of Mans was immediately surrendered to Wil∣liam, and the nobility of Le Maine took the oath of allegiance: Helie offered his service to the king, who was at first inclinable to engage such an active warrior in his interest, but he was dissuaded by Robert, count of Meulan, his chief counsellor, who perhaps was jealous of Helie's talents; and this last seeing his offer rejected, told William that since he had no occasion for his ser∣vice, he could not blame him for attempting to recover the possessions he had lost. The king replied, that he might act as he should think proper, and granted him a safe conduct to La Fleche, which he fortified without delay. Not that he committed any act of hostility while Rufus tarried in Normandy; but when he returned to England, Helie seized the very first opportunity to re∣new the war.</P>

<P>Having first secured the favour of the Manceaux, he appeared with some troops before Le Mans, and provoked the Norman garrison to make a sally, in which they were routed; then entering the city pell mell with the fugi∣tives, he was received with loud acclamations by the inhabitants; though the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

A courier dispatched by Robert de Belesme with an account of this surprisal, found William hunting in the New Forest; and he no sooner re∣ceived the intelligence, than calling aloud to his attendants, "You that love me, follow me;" rode directly to the sea-side, near Dartmouth, where he found a vessel ready to sail. But, the weather being very stormy, the ship∣master scrupled to weigh anchor, until he was compelled to put to sea by Ru∣fus, who encouraged him, by observing that he had never heard of a king's be∣ing drowned. Next morning he arrived at Barfleur, whence he posted to Bon∣neville, where he assembled his troops, and marched to the relief of his garri∣son
<PB N="255" REF="2640"/>
in Le Mans, with such expedition, that Helie was obliged to raise the siege, and retire to Chateau de Loir. William invested Majol, in hope of taking the place by assault, in which he received such a blow from a stone, as had well nigh deprived him of his life.

<P>About this period, the crusards took the city of Jerusalem, where they committed horrid barbarities; and, intending to erect it into a kingdom, offered the crown to Robert, duke of Normandy, who declining that dignity, they elected Godfrey, count of Bouillon, whose valour and conduct had greatly contributed to the success of the enterprize. William, duke of Guienne, ani∣mated by the example of so many princes, and the glory which they had already acquired, resolved to take the cross, and conduct a strong reinforcement to the Christians in the Holy land: but, as this scheme could not be executed without a considerable expence, which his revenues could not desray, he had recourse to the king of England, who agreed to advance a sum of money, on the same terms which had been embraced by his brother Robert. He had actually raised the greatest part of this supply, with which he intended to cross the sea, and in person take possession of the borrower's dominions, when his voyage was pre∣vented by an accident that was not much regretted by his subjects.</P>

<P>Just as he mounted his horse, in order to take the diversion of hunting in the New Forest, he is said to have been warned by a monk from go∣ing abroad that day, inasmuch as he (the monk) had dreamed a strange dream that seemed to presage his majesty's death. Rufus, smiling at his su∣perstition, ordered him to be paid for his zeal, and desired him to dream more favourably for the future. He was attended by Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, famous for his archery, who always accompanied him in those excur∣sions; and to whom he that afternoon gave two arrows out of his own hand. Towards sun-set they found themselves separated from the rest of the retinue, and the king alighted to wait for their taking post at their different stations, when a stag passing, he shot and wounded the animal, yet not so mortally but that he fled, and William followed, in hope of seeing him fall. As the sun beamed in his face, he held up his hand before his eyes, and stood in that pos∣ture looking at the wounded deer, when another starting from a thicket, Tyrrel let fly an arrow, which either glanced from a tree or the horns of the stag,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1100.</NOTE> and struck the king into the heart. He dropped dead instantaneously, and the innocent author of his death, terrified at the accident, galloped away to the sea-side, where he found a vessel, in which he was conveyed to the con∣tinent. William's body being found by some countrymen passing through the forest, was laid a-cross a horse and carried to Winchester, where it was next day interred in the cathedral under the tower, without ceremony or the least<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesb.

<P>Thus fell William, surnamed Rufus, from his red hair and florid complexion, after he had lived four and forty years, and reigned near thirteen, during which he oppressed his people in every form of tyranny and insult. He was equally void of learning, principle, and humanity; haughty, passionate, brutal, profligate, and ungrateful; a scoffer at religion; a scourge to the clergy; vain-glorious, talkative, rapacious, lavish, and dissolute, and an inveterate ene∣my

In return for this instance of their loyalty he took all opportunities to fleece and enslave them; and at one time imprisoned fifty of the best families of the kingdom, on pretence of killing his deer: so that they were compelled to purchase their liberty at the expence of all their wealth; though not before they had under∣gone<NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> the fire ordeal.

<P>Had Robert been in Normandy when William died, he would in all probability have mounted the English throne without opposition, according to the stipulations of the treaty concluded between the two brothers, and ratified by the principal noblemen of both countries: but, instead of returning home immediately after the reduction of Jerusalem, he lingered by the way in Apulia, where he married Sybilla, daughter of William, count of Conversana, a lady renowned for her beauty and qualifications; and while he indulged himself in the enjoyment of his amiable bride, whose fortune he lavished away among his fol∣lowers, he lost the opportunity which never afterwards occurred. The English nation was divided between affecti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and interest; they loved Robert for his good nature and generosity, but they dreaded his indolence and profusion; and justly concluded, from the fame of his expensive living in this last crusade, that on his return he would be absolutely destitute of all means to make good his pretensions. On the other hand, Henry was a native of England, born after his father's accession to the throne; a circumstance which had weight with some people: but the great advantage which this prince had over his brother was being on the spot, to take the first and most necessary measures for the support of his pretensions. He was employed in the same diversion, and in the same forest which proved fatal to William, when he heard of that prince's death; and rode full speed to Winchester, where he demanded the keys of the royal treasury, which were in the hands of William de Breteuil, eldest son of William Fitzosbern, formerly earl of Hereford. That nobleman had just arrived from the New Forest, where he too had been hunting; and, informed of the
<PB N="257" REF="2660"/>
king's catastrophe, hastened home to take care of his charge, which he flatly refused to resign, telling Henry the sceptre of England belonged to his brother Robert, for whom he would reserve the treasure and his allegiance, according to the oath he had taken. The dispute was on the point of producing bloodshed, when Robert, count de Meulant, and a great number of the late king's atten∣dants, coming up, espoused the cause of Henry, and compelled Breteuil to sur∣render the treasure, with part of which they in all probability hoped to be re∣warded for their service. He was immediately proclaimed king, after a very tumultuary election, influenced by the populace, which denounced vengeance upon all those who should dare to dispute his succession; and he forthwith began to exercise the regal authority, in preferring William Giffard to the see of Win∣chester. Then he and his partisans set out for London, where he was anointed and crowned in Westminster-abbey, by Maurice, bishop of London, after he had taken the coronation oath; and this ceremony was finished in sixty-six hours after the death of the late king: so much was Henry afraid that Robert might arrive unexpectedly, and anticipate his design.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>As the people had too much reason, during the two last reigns, to think that a king is very apt to forget or disregard his coronation oath, Henry, for the farther satisfaction of his subjects, granted that same day a charter, con∣firming their privileges, and redressing some grievances under which they laboured. By this deed, which was authenticated in the most solemn manner, and tran∣scribed into a great number of copies dispersed all over the kingdom, he esta∣blished the churches in possession of all their immunities, and exempted them from all the hardships they had sustained from the tyranny of Rufus, especially that of being kept vacant for the king's use, and afterwards put up to public sale, without any regard to merit or capacity. He abolished the excessive fines which used to be exacted from the heirs of noblemen for the livery of their lands; and at the same time exempted the vassals of noblemen from the same imposition; he permitted all the vassals of the crown to dispose of their children in marriage, ac∣cording to their own pleasure, except to the king's enemies; widows were invested with the same privilege, without being obliged to pay for licences from the crown; he granted the wardship of minors to the mother or nearest relation; he sup∣pressed the duty of moneyage, paid once in three years, in consideration of the king's preserving the value of the coin unaltered; he remitted all fines, mulcts, and debts in the exchequer, arising from vexatious prosecution; allowed the ba∣rons to bequeath their personal estates by will; and regulated the division of ef∣fects belonging to those who died intestate, among their wives, children, and nearest relations; he mitigated the security given by persons charged with felony or misdemeanour; pardoned all murders and other offences committed before his coronation; exempted the lands possessed by the military tenants of the crown from gelds, talliages, and benevolences; he restored the laws of St. Edward, and forgave all rapine and depredation, provided the offenders would make im∣mediate restitution. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>In pursuance of the same laudable scheme of reformation and redress, he expelled from court all the ministers and instruments of his brother's debauchery and arbitrary power, and published a severe edict against delinquents, adulterers, denouncing rigorous penalties for such trans∣gressions, and death itself to be inflicted upon such as should be found guilty of
<PB N="258" REF="2670"/>
peculation. He abolished the odious curfew; made an example of his brother's wicked minister Ralf Flambard, who being by this time raised to the see of Durham, was stripped of his dignity and revenue, and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where, however, he was plentifully maintained on an allowance of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. Vital.</NOTE> two shillings a day, the common appointment of state prisoners. As Henry had been greatly obliged to the citizens of London, in his acquisition of the crown, he gratified them with a charter of very ample privileges; and, in order to crown the satisfaction of the people, he recalled Anselm archbishop of Canter∣bury, who was become extremely popular in England, through the influence of the monks, by this time settled in almost all the benefices of the kingdom. That prelate accepted the invitation with transport, especially as the king hinted that he should have the chief direction of affairs, and landed at Dover, to the inexpressible joy of the whole nation; but Henry was a little confounded when he refused to do him homage, adhering to the canons of the council of Bari, which forbad eccle∣siastics to receive investitures from the laity, or to pay them homage on any account. The conditions therefore of their living together in a good understanding were, that the king should relinquish the prerogative of investing bishops and abbots, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmer.</NOTE> in every thing relating to the church, pay implicit obedience to the pope. Henry, though shocked at the insolent proposals of this arrogant priest, who wanted to curtail his authority, was forced to temporize, because not yet firmly esta∣blished on the throne; for he knew that Anselm, by throwing his interest into the scale of Robert, might keep the balance in suspence, and perhaps make the other end preponderate. He therefore proposed that agents should be dispatched to Rome, with a remonstrance to the pope, desiring his holiness to dispense with the canons about investitures, as such laws were diametrically opposite to the customs of the nation; and that in the mean time Anselm should enter into possession of his see. This expedient was approved, and a kind of truce concluded, until the deputies could obtain an answer from the Roman pontiff.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Henry's interest was concerned in another view to maintain the favour of the archbishop. He had acquired the reputation of a debauchee from the prosecution of promiscuous amours; and he resolved by one step to retrieve his character, and strengthen his title to the throne. Maude, daughter of Mal∣colm III. by Margaret, sister to Edgar Atheling, had been brought from Scotland by her uncle, and educated in a nunnery at Winchester, under the eye of her aunt Christian. This princess did the king propose to marry; but as she had wore the veil, though not a prosessed nun, it was necessary to use the credit of the archbishop, who assembling a council at Lambeth, took cognizance of the affair in a judicial manner, and declared Maude free from any ecclesiastical restrictions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. Ibid.</NOTE> so that the marriage was celebrated without further hesitation; and both king∣doms were extremely well pleased with the event.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions Robert, duke of Normandy, arrived in his dominions, and resumed the reins of government without opposition; for, although they had been mortgaged to the late king William, Henry did not choose<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1101.</NOTE> at this conjuncture to claim that part of the succession. But Robert, far from thinking himself obliged by this forbearance, made no secret of his resentment against his brother, who had supplanted him in his absence; and loudly declared he would take the first opportunity of doing himself justice. He was confirmed in this resolution by the bishop of Durham, who had escaped from the Tower;
<PB N="259" REF="2680"/>
and several Norman noblemen undertook to support his pretensions; he even found means to raise a considerable party among the English, and began to make preparations for invading England. Henry could plainly perceive that his sub∣jects fluctuated in their inclinations between him and his brother; and that they made a wide distinction between Robert in Palestine and Robert in Normandy. In this emergency he had recourse to Anselm, who employed all his credit in fixing him upon the throne; he convened the principal noblemen, Normans as well as English, and expatiated with such eloquence and energy upon the cala∣mities of a civil war, and the sincerity of Henry's intention to make his people happy, that they seemed intirely satisfied, and determined to be quiet. Never∣theless it was no sooner known that Robert was ready to embark, than the majo∣rity of the lords declared for him, and part of the fleet followed that example.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="40" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XL.</HEAD>
<P>This defection facilitated his descent at Portsmouth, where he was joined by a great number of his brother's subjects, who promised to risque their lives and fortunes in his service; and assured him that Henry in a little time would be abandoned by the whole nation. Mean while the king exerted himself in assembling his troops, and the archbishop employed his eloquence and emissaries so effectually in representing the impiety of violating oaths, especially that of al∣legiance to a king, who had made such concessions to his people, that the whole army became staunch to their cause, and a number of noblemen and officers who wavered, were by these harrangues confirmed in their fidelity to Henry. The king's forces thus assured, advanced from Pevensey towards Portsmouth, and the competitors were soon in sight of each other; though both equally unwil∣ling to hazard a battle, because Robert found himself disappointed in his expecta∣tion of being joined by the English, and Henry did not know how far he could confide in his soldiers, though he foresaw that his own perdition must be the con∣sequence of his defeat. Anselm took this opportunity of offering his mediation, which was reinforced by all the noblemen and prelates in both armies; and after some debate a treaty of peace was concluded, on condition that Robert should quit his claim to England, in consideration of Henry's paying him annually the sum of three thousand marks, and giving up the Cotantin, with all that he possessed in Nor∣mandy, except Danfront, which he could not cede without breaking the oath he had taken to the inhabitants when they received him into the place; that the adherents of each party should be restored to the lands and honours they formerly possessed, whether in England or in Normandy; and that if either prince should die without issue, the survivor should succeed to his dominions. This treaty be∣ing signed and ratified, the armies on each side were disbanded, and Robert, having lived two months in the utmost harmony with his brother, returned in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Sax.

<DIV4 N="41" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLI.</HEAD>
<P>Henry, having established himself in the throne by virtue of this ac∣commodation, could not without resentment remember those by whom his crown had been brought into such jeopardy; and though he had executed the articles of the treaty even so as to permit the restoration of Flambard to the see of Dur∣ham, yet he resolved to punish every person of importance, who had joined his bro∣ther; and that punishment took place as soon as he could find other pretexts for ex∣ercising his revenge. Robert de Belesme, earl of Arundel and Shrewsbury, was the chief aim of his indignation; him therefore he beset with spies, who took such advantages of his unguarded expressions and impetuosity of temper, that they
<PB N="260" REF="2690"/>
soon found matter for an accusation, consisting of five and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orty articles, which was delivered into his hand one day while he attended at court. He desired that he might be indulged with time to prepare an answer; but, instead of employ∣ing it for that purpose, he fortified his castles, and put himself in a posture of defence.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="42" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>The king immediately ordered him to be proclaimed a traitor, and marched at the head of an army to besiege his castle of Arundel, the commander of which desired leave to send for orders to his lord, that he might know whether he should defend or deliver the fortress. The king indulged him so far, and left a sufficient number of troops to block up the castle, ordering the bishop of Lin∣coln to besiege Tikehill, while he himself advanced into Shropshire, the greatest part of which belonged to Robert de Belesme. Here he attacked Bridgenorth, counted the strongest place in England, and well supplied with men, ammuni∣tion, and provision. The garrison consisted of a body of Welsh, under the com∣mand<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1102.</NOTE> of Roger Fitzcorbet, Robert Nevil, and Ulger Grosvenor, who made such a vigorous defence, that Henry began to deem it impregnable; but the success, which he could not obtain by his arms, he owed to the interest of William Pantolf, governor of Stafford-castle, who being related to the com∣manders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. Vital.</NOTE> in Bridgenorth, prevailed upon them to surrender the castle. While Henry was employed in this siege, the principal nobility of England offered their mediation in favour of Robert; but the king would listen to no terms of accom∣modation. Having reduced Bridgenorth, he directed his march towards Shrews∣bury, and while he approached the place, the earl seeing his affairs desperate, ac∣knowledged his crime, and surrendered at discretion, submitting himself to the mercy of the king, who upon his delivering up Arundel and the rest of his castles, granted him his life and a safe-conduct to Normandy; but he confiscated his vast estate, and his brothers were involved in his disgrace.</P>

<P>Roger, earl of Lancashire, Arnulph de Montgomery, lord of Pem∣brokeshire, Robert de Pontefract, and Robert de Malet, were likewise divested of ther estates, and banished the kingdom. Hugh de Grentesmesnil thought to save his fortune by mortgaging it for fifteen years to the king's favourite, Robert count de M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulant, while he himself went on a pilgrimage to the Holy land; but M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulant refused to restore it in the sequel: so that it was for ever lost to Hugh's posterity. By these arbitrary measures Henry quelled the exorbitant power of the noblemen, among whom the lands of England had been distributed by the con∣queror with such profusion, that two or three of them united were almost an overmatch for the whole power of the crown; whereas, by parcelling out their forfeited estates among a great number of his needy adherents, Henry rewarded their attachment, while he enabled them to serve him more effectually, and sub∣stituted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogdale'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Baronage.

<P>All the nobles in the land were more easily managed than the arch∣bishop of Canterbury alone; that prelate, who was a true monk and bigot to the power of Rome, had conceived two projects, which could not be executed without great difficulty; the first was to establish celibacy among ecclesiastics, and the second to hinder bishops and abbots from receiving the investiture of their benefices from the king. The agents sent to Rome returned about the time of the treaty between the two brothers, and brought an answer from the pope, in∣sisting upon the execution of the canons against lay investiture. Nevertheless,
<PB N="261" REF="2700"/>
the king refused to part with his prerogative; and Anselm refused to consecrate the bishops whom Henry had appointed. This dispute produced a quarrel, which would have been attended with the immediate privation of the archbishop, had not his services been so recent and popularity so great, that it would have been dangerous to treat him as an outlaw. All hope of accommodation, however, being destroyed by the obstinacy of the parties, Anselm resolved to carry his complaints in person to pope Paschal II. by whose direction he had in all probability engaged in this enterprize. He was accompanied by the prelates, who had quitted their benefices rather than acknowledge the king's supremacy; and Henry at the same time sent ambassadors to defend his cause before the pope; these were Hebert and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1103.</NOTE> Robert, bishops of Norwich and Litchfield, together with William de Warelwaast, an ecclesiastic of profound learning. Notwithstanding the capacity and eloquence of these advocates, the pope refused to abate a tittle of his pretensions, and even threatened to excommunicate Henry, whom he found as tenacious of his prerogative; when a temperament was proposed and admitted, and both parties agreed, that the bishops and abbots should do homage to the king, and that he should recede from the right of bestowing the investiture of benefices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>This dispute with the court of Rome did not divert Henry's atten∣tion from his own interest in other particulars. One of his chief aims was to re∣duce the exorbitant power of the nobility; and he became immensely rich by the confiscation of the barons who had declared for his brother. Among these William de Warenne, earl of Surry, retiring to Normandy, and complaining to the duke of the great estate he had lost in his cause; Robert, who had a great share of knight-errantry in his composition, came over immediately to England, with eleven followers, in order to persuade his brother to make restitution. Henry pretended to take umbrage at this visit, assembled a council extraordi∣nary, to deliberate in what manner he should be treated, and sent a formal mes∣sage to know the cause of his arrival in England. When he expostulated with the king about the confiscation of the earl of Surry, Henry upbraided him in very harsh terms with a breach of their treaty, in granting to Robert de Be∣lesme his father's demesnes in Normandy; and Robert began to find himself in a very ticklish situation. The count de Meulant, Henry's prime minister, hinted to him, that he had no other way of escaping the danger, than that of relinquishing his annuity; and when Robert made a present of this pension to the queen, Henry's countenance cleared up, the earl of Surry was restored to his honours, and Robert returned to his own dominions, cursing his own rash, un∣premeditated conduct. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>In the course of the succeeding year, Henry exhibited another fla∣grant proof of his own avarice, and hatred to those whom he knew or believed to be favourers of his brother's interest. William, count de Mortmain, and earl of Cornwal, his own cousin german, claimed the earldom of Kent, as heir to Odo, bishop of Bayeux, who had accompanied the duke of Normandy in his expedition to the Holy land, and died at Palermo in Sicily. This demand was made of Henry at the very time of his being threatened with the last inva∣sion; and the king had amused him with a favourable answer, until the storm was blown over, that William might not be provoked to join his brother: the earl accordingly observed a strict neutrality; but when he repeated his claim af∣ter the peace, Henry not only mortified him with a flat denial, but also called
<PB N="262" REF="2710"/>
him to account for some lands, which he affirmed William illegally possessed. He therefore in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a process against him; and the justiciaries, after a formal tri∣al, divested him not only of the lands in question, but also of his earldom and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 110<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> whole fortune in England.

<P>While he thus rebuked his brother for maladministration, and assumed the protector of the oppressed Normans, he saddled his own subjects with an exorbitant imposition, on pretence of maintaining the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

Having assembled a numerous army, and amassed great sums of money for the purposes of corruption, he set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail for Normandy, and made himself master of Caen, and several other towns, while Robert re∣mained inactive, and unable to traverse his intrigues, or stop the progress of his arms. The duke of Bretagne and the count of Anjou allowed Henry to put garrisons into some of their frontier places, rather than make himself master of the whole dutchy, because they perceived that no peace could be made, except to their prejudice. Among these the bishop of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z was the most indefatigable in∣cendiary; he had been expelled from his diocese by the two rebellious counts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The campaign was opened with the siege of Tenerchebray, belonging to the count de Mortagne, who had by this time espoused the cause of the duke; and as the place was strongly fortified with soldiers and provision, it sustained a siege until Robert was in a condition to march to its relief, with reinforcements he had received from Mortagne, Bellesme, the king of France, and some Norman noblemen, who detested the selfish disposition of Henry, and were of conse∣quence averse to his government. Thus supported, Robert resolved to give his brother battle; and when the two armies were in sight of each other, some monks employed their mediation to prevent the effusion of blood; but, as Henry insisted upon the duke's renouncing the government of his dominions in∣tirely, and one half of the revenue, the proposal was rejected with disdain, and a battle immediately ensued. Robert charged the main body of the English with such impetuosity, and was so well seconded by the count of Mortagne, that they were broken and gave g ound; but Robert de Bellesme, who commanded one of the wings, was at the same time put to flight by the count de Maine, and the king advancing with a fresh body of horse to sustain the center, the English and Bretons rallied immediately, and Robert's little army, weakened by the de∣feat of Bellesme, and overpowered with numbers, was entirely routed, in spite of all his efforts and acts of personal valour. Though he saw his forces defeated he would not quit the field, but chose rather to be taken prisoner than turn his back upon the enemy; this was likewise the case with the count de Mortagne, and Edgar Atheling, who had lived with Robert since his return from Palestine, in the intimacy of friendship, produced from the similarity of their characters. This prince, however, fared much better than his friend; for he was set<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1106.</NOTE> at liberty as a person of no consequence in England, where he died of a de∣crepid old age; whereas the unfortunate duke, after having influenced the in∣habitants of Rouen and Falaise to receive the conqueror, was sent into England, and kept close prisoner in different parts of the kingdom, till at length, after a mise∣rable captivity of eight and twenty years, death set him free, at Cardiff in Gla∣morgansh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">He is said to have been deprived of his vision by a red hot copper bason applied to his eyes.

<P>The first step he took after his arrival, was extremely agreeable to his subjects; this was the reformation of some abuses which had crept into the regula∣tion and oeconomy of his court. By the feudal tenure, the tenants, on the crown demesnes, were obliged to furnish the king and his retinue with all necessaries and provisions when he travelled, under the inspection of the steward of the household, who attended him in his progress. Henry's followers made use of this pretext to commit all sorts of outrages; they wasted the country through which they passed; burned or sold publicly the superfluous provisions they found in their lodg∣ings, washed their horses with the liquors they could not consume, insulted their landlords, violated their wives and daughters, and acted with such brutality, that the people hearing of the king's approach, deserted their habitations, and re∣tired to the woods with their families and effects. To remedy these disorders, Henry published an edict, by virtue of which the persons convicted of such of∣fences were punished with the loss of eyes, or hands, or some other member; and this law being vigorously executed, soon redressed the grievance. At the same time he enacted another decree against coiners, who had long adulterated the currency, under the protection of the nobles, for whom they worked privately in their houses, to which the officers of justice had no access: by this edict it was ordained that false coiners should, upon conviction, lose their eyes and their verility. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

He therefore assembled a synod to deliberate upon mea∣sures for the better observation of the canons against the marriage of priests, and the former penalties being found ineffectual, it was decreed that all married priests should put away their wives, on pain of being immediately suspended, and excommunicated, should they afterwards officiate in divine service. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul.

<P>Anselm, after having established these regulations, employed his in∣terest in erecting the see of Ely, from part of the diocese of Lincoln, which

He had hoped to elude these marks of submission by obtaining a pall from Rome; but Anselm, being apprised of his intention, desired the pope to delay the pall, until Thomas should have obeved the dictates of his duty; and in the mean time he inhibited all the bishops of England from assisting at his consecration. Anselm, however, did not live to see the success of his letter to the pope; but in a few days after his death, Ulric, a Roman cardinal, arrived in England, with a pall for the church of York, to be disposed of at the pleasure of Anselm. The intervening death of the archbishop of Canterbury gave rise to a dispute upon the subject; and the king summoning a court of prelates and barons, it was determined, after some debate, that Thomas should, under his hand and seal, make solemn profession of canonical obedience to the primate of Canter∣bury and the see of Rome.

<P>The pleasure Henry derived from this alliance was not a little damped at hearing that Lewis the Gross, and Fulk, count of Anjou, had re∣solved to estabish his nephew William, the minor son of Robert, in the possession of his father's dominions. Henry, after the surrender of Falaise, had committed this young prince to the care of Helie de St. Saen, who treated him with such regard and affection, that his uncle began to fear he might in time form a party in his behalf. He therefore detached Robert de Beauchamp, with a party of horse, to seize the young orphan, and convey him to a place of security; but he was concealed in such a manner, that the design miscarried. Helie, being at this time deprived of his town, thought he was now at liberty to espouse Wil∣liam's interest openly; and he engaged a number of Norman noblemen in his cause. Robert de Bellesme became his warmest partisan; Fulk, count of An∣jou, promised to give him his daughter in marriage; and Lewis the Gross, who had succeeded his father Philip on the throne of France, undertook to support him in the recovery of his father's dominions.</P>

In consequence of this treaty, the young prince of Normandy was obliged to quit the court of Anjou; and after having wan∣dered as a fugitive from one country to another, solliciting succours from diffe∣rent princes, he was hospitably received by Baldwin, count of Flanders, who promised to indulge him with his protection and assistance <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

<P>The affairs of Normandy being settled, the king returned to England, and in the spring resolved to fill the see of Canterbury, after a vacancy of five years, during which Ralf, bishop of Rochester, had performed the functions of primate, by the appointment of the prior and monks of Canterbury. A<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At this period too he imposed a grievous tax upon the kingdom, in order to maintain a war against Lewis, king of France, with whom he had been always at variance since that prince's accession to the throne.

His ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew Thibaud, count of Blois, son of his sister Adela, having received some insult or injury from the French king, Hen∣ry excited him to vengeance, and even supplied him with a strong reinforcement.

He accordingly raised an army, in order to recover William's inheritance, and being joined by the count of Flanders, with a strong reinforcement, entered the dukedom, and commenced hostilities; tho' not before he had formally demanded of Henry that he would renounce his usur∣pation, and release his vassal Robert, whom he unjustly detained in prison.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1118.</NOTE> Henry, in the mean while, made great preparations at the expence of the Eng∣lish, to repel these invaders of the Norman dominions, and crossed the sea with all possible expe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition. Being joined by the duke of Bretagne, and the count of Blois, he began his march against the enemy, and advanced with such diligence, that Lewis was almost surprised, and retreated with some precipi∣tation. He seemed on this occasion to be intimidated by the power and pre∣sumption of the English king; for he purchased a peace with the cession of Gi∣sors, and Henry returned immediately to his British dominions, in order to prevent the reception of the abbot Anselm, who was so well pleased with Eng∣land at his last visit with the pall for the archbishop of Canterbury, that he em∣ployed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Notwithstanding the treaty concluded between France and Eng∣land, Henry's back was hardly turned, when Lewis surprized Gisors, and wasted the adjacent country without opposition. Henry received advice of this invasion, without seeming to take any step towards the defence of his Norman territories; and his tame forbearance on this occasion was so surprising, that
<PB N="269" REF="2780"/>
one of his nobles took the liberty to observe, his reputation would suffer from his philosophy, when Henry replied very calmly, he had learned from his father, that the best way of dealing with the French was to let them spend their first fire. Perhaps he was perplexed in his own mind, because he knew not whom he could trust in Normandy. He had seized the persons of some whose fidelity he suspected, and among others Hugh de Gourney, and Henry count D'Eu, who were not released until they had surrendered their castles, and who were no sooner out of his power, than they took up arms against him. As he would not venture to employ the Normans, who, for the most part, were dis∣affected to his person, he had been obliged to carry on the war with the help of the English, and some Bretons he enlisted in his service; and he met with several checks, which served to increase his caution. Evreux had been sur∣prized by Amaury de Monfort, whom Henry attempted in vain to bribe over to his interest: the French had taken L'aigle; and the king, in attempting to recover it, had like to have lost his life: the count of Anjou had worsted Henry as he advanced to the relief of Alençon, which the count had invested, and afterwards reduced: Baldwin, count of Flanders, had ravaged the whole country as far as Rouen, where the king lay with his troops, afraid to give him battle; so that he had great reason to dread the issue of another war. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Nevertheless he seemed to wake all at once from his lethargy, and assembling a strong body of forces, transported them, together with a great sum of money, to the continent, where his affairs, in a little time, took a more favour∣able turn. Baldwin died of a wound he received in the face with a lance. En∣querrand de Chaumont, an enterprising warrior, who had kept all the country as far as Rouen in continual alarms, was taken off by a natural death; and Fulk, count of Anjou, who had joined Lewis since the last treaty between Henry and him, was now again attached to the king of England, by means of a large sum of money, and the consummation of the marriage between young William and the count's daughter.</P>

<P>Thus freed from such a triumvirate of formidable enemies, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Henry's forces advancing with great expedition, came up with the French so unexpectedly, that they had scarce time to draw up their first line before the battle begun. Nevertheless they behaved with great gallantry, under the com∣mand of duke Robert's son William, who charged the van of the English with such impetuosity, that they fell back upon the main body, commanded by the king in person, whose utmost efforts could not sustain the attack. While he exerted all his endeavours to rally his troops, he was singled out by a brave Nor∣man knight, called William Crispin, who discharged at his head two such fu∣rious strokes of a sabre, as penetrated his helmet and wounded him severely; at the sight of his own blood, which rushed down his visage, he was enraged to a double exertion of his strength, and retorted the blows with such interest that his antagonist was unhorsed and taken prisoner. Had the valour of young William been properly seconded, the French would certainly have obtained a complete victory; but instead of forming from their line a march in a regu∣lar manner, they no sooner saw the success of the Norman prince, than they rushed forward in confusion, and the rear of the English advancing to the att∣ack

The prince went on board a new ship belonging to Thomas Fitzstephen, whose fa∣ther had carried over the Conqueror in his first expedition against Harold; and the young nobility, to the number of three hundred, crouded into the same vessel where they caroused with the utmost intemperance; the mariners were indulged with wine to extreme intoxication, and the master himself had exceeded the bounds of sobriety, when the prince proposed that he should make an effort to come up with the king, who was considerably a-head. Fitzstephen immediately clapped on all his sail, and being incapable of directing the pilotage, she ran upon a sunken rock, called the Catte raze, with such violence, that she was shattered in pieces. Before she parted in the middle, they found means to hoist out the boat for the prince's preservation, and he had already made some way towards the shore, when hearing the shrieks of his natural sister Maude, countess of Perche, he returned to the wreck, and took her in; but such a number of people leaped into the boat at the same time, that she sunk, and every soul on board of her perished. All those that remained in the ship met with the same fate, except one Bartoud, a butcher of Rouen, who seizing the mast, floated till morning, when he was taken up by some fishermen; Geoffry, son of Gilbert de Craigle, laid<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1120.</NOTE> hold on the same timber, but being a weakly youth, could not resist the cold, and dropped off before day-light. Thomas, the ship-master, after having been some time under water, swam up to the butcher, and enquired into the prince's fate, when being told that he had perished; "I will not (said he) outlive the prince," and immediately disappeared. The shrieks of those unhappy people were heard by Roger de Coutances, and many other persons on shore, and the same noise reached the king's ship, though three days passed before he was made<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord. Vital. Mat. Paris. Knyghton.</NOTE> acquainted with the fatal accident. When the news were brought to him at Southampton, he fainted away, and was never seen to smile from that moment to the day of his death. The English nation sustained no great loss in the death of a profligate prince, who had on several occasions expressed his aversion for them, and even declared that he would one day make them draw the plough like oxen; but the case was different with Henry, who not only lost a son whom he loved with the warmest affection, but in his death saw all the pains he had taken to establish the succession intirely frustrated, and the prospect of Norman∣dy's reverting to the son of Robert, a promising young prince, who was already the darling of the Normans.</P>

The monks of Canterbury threw themselves at his majesty's feet, intreating that he would not deviate from the antient practice, but prefer one of their order; and when their request was rejected, they held out two days, until being threatened by the bishops with excommunication, they elected, out of four nominated for their choice, William de Corboil, prior of the canons of Chiche, who was con∣firmed by the king, approved by the prelates, and consecrated at Canterbury by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He had made such progress in his endea∣vours, that the whole country was on the point of revolting, when Henry arrived with a strong army from England, in consequence of the intelligence he had re∣ceived. His first undertaking was the siege of Audemer, which he reduced; then he added some new fortifications to the castles of Caen, Rouen, and Arques, and reinforced the garrisons. These vigorous steps and precautions overawed the Normans, though Robert de Mellent and the count de Montfort his associate still kept the field with a body of forces, unt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l at last these two noblemen fell in∣to an ambuscade, and were made pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oners.

The coin was debased to such a degree that a pound<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At this period the rights and independency of the English church were invaded by the pope, who, notwithstanding the promises he had made Henry at their interview in Gifors, no sooner found himself established in the papacy by the captivity and submission of Gregory the antipope, than he resolved to exercise the authority of the Roman church to its full extent, and sent cardinal de Crema as his legate a latere into England. That prelate was honourably re∣ceived at his arrival by the archbishop of Canterbury, in whose place he officiated at divine service, sitting in the highest feat and wearing the pontifical habit, to the amazement and indignation of the English people. As he was directed to in∣quire into a controversy which had arisen between the archbishop of York and the Scottish bishops, who refused to acknowledge the supremacy of that see, he made a progress into the north as far as Roxburgh, where he had a conference on the sub∣ject with David, king of Scotland: at his return to London, he assembled a general council, in which he presided on a throne raised above the English archbishops; and enacted among other laws, a very severe canon against the marriage of the cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, against which he declaimed with great intemperance, affirming it was a crime of the deepest dye for a man to consecrate the body of Christ immediately after leaving the arms of a strumpet; an epithet which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estowed on the wives of the clergy.

Henry, after a fruitless expectation of three years, despaired of having issue by his second marriage; and therefore resolved to settle the succession upon his daughter Maud, the empress, who had returned to England on her husband's death, and was very much beloved by the people on account of her being descended from the Saxon kings. She was likewise very agree∣able to the Normans, who, as they could not have a prince of their own nation to rule over them, found it would be their interest to adopt the government of a princess, grand-daughter of the Conqueror, to whom they owed all their possessions in England. Henry, pleased to find the affections of the nation united in favour of his daughter, convoked an assembly of all the immediate vassals of the crown, comprehending David, king of Scotland, as prince of Cumberland, and Stephen, count of Boulogne, the king's own nephew; in presence of whom Henry declared Maud presumptive heiress of his crown, and as such she was recognized by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sim.

<P>The untimely death of this young prince, who had already ex∣hibited repeated proofs of extraordinary courage and ability, entirely dispelled the fears of Henry. He made peace with Lewis; entered into a league with Thierry of Alsace, who succeeded to the county of Flanders, and married Henry's daughter-in-law Sybilla; while the Normans, seeing no hope of being delivered from his yoke, began to be reconciled to his dominion. Indeed he took some pains to reconcile them to his government. He extended his forgiveness to all those who implored his mercy; and attached several men of influence and cre∣dit to his interest, by acts of kindness and generosity: among others releasing Mellent and Fitz-Gervaise from the prisons in which they had been confined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The former of these accompanied him to England, where he became a great favourite, and served the king with uncommon zeal and fidelity. It was at this period that Henry altered the revenue of his demesne lands, the rents of which had been hitherto paid in kind. The tenants were so impoverished with taxes, and other hardships, from the nature of their tenure, that they took all opportunities of meeting him in his progress, and presenting their ploughshares as useless imple∣ments. A dreadful famine ensued; and the king at last appointed commission∣ers to examine the estates, and fix a certain prince in money to be annually paid in lieu of the corn, provision, and service, which had been usually exacted.

To this last Henry had formerly inclined, out of oppo∣sition to the French king, who protected the other; but Innocent found means to cajole him in such a manner, that he obtained his friendship and declaration in favour of his pretensions. After this conference the king returned to England with his daughter Maud, between whom and her husband some misunderstanding had arisen: and during her residence at her father's court, another general as∣sembly of the states being convoked at Northampton, the barons renewed their oath to the empress, whom they now acknowledged as the apparent heiress of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>SO weak is human foresight, that some of the measures which Henry took to secure the succession of his crown to his daughter, contributed to her ex∣clusion. In order to strengthen the interests of his family, he had heaped favours upon Stephen, the third son of the count de Blois, by Adela, daughter of the Conqueror. He caressed him at his court, and not only bestowed upon him the honour of Eye and all the great estate of Robert Malet, but he had also effected a match between him and Maud, daughter and heiress of Eustace, count de Boulogne, by Mary of Scotland, sister to king Henry's first queen. In right of this lady Stephen succeeded to the county of Boulogne, besides a vast estate in England, which had been given to her ancestors at the conquest. Henry thinking he could not do too much for his own nephews, who would undoubtedly support the interest of the empress against all opposition, created Stephen's younger brother Henry, abbot of Glastonbury and bishop of Winches∣ter; so that the two brothers were by far the most powerful subjects in the king∣dom. Stephen, conscious of his own importance and popularity, which was very great, could not resist the temptation of appropriating the crown to him∣self, instead of securing it to Maud, whose title he had so solemnly sworn to maintain. He reflected upon the ease with which Henry had supplanted the absent heir of blood, and he resolved in this particular to follow his example. In matters of less importance he might have obeyed the dictates of his gratitude and duty to his benefactor, and respected the oath he had taken; but Henry himself, and many other princes of that age, had manifested by their whole conduct, how little they were restrained by the ties of religion and morality, when a crown was the object in view. He therefore, in his uncle's life-time, began to form a party among the English noblemen, while his brother employ∣ed all his influence to prepossess the clergy in his behalf. The endeavours of both succeeded even beyond their expectation. The English had been accustom∣ed to see the heir of blood excluded from their throne; they loved the person and character of Stephen; did not much relish a female reign, which they had never experienced; and both Normans and English saw the blood of the Con∣queror<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

He was likewise insulted by the inhabitants of Canterbury, who shut their gates against him; but far from being discouraged by these repulses he proceeded to London, where he was received with great honours by the citi∣zens, who saluted him as king. Thence repairing to Winchester, his brother, who was bishop of that see, prevailed upon William de Pont-del Arche to de∣liver up the late king's treasure, amounting to one hundred thousand pounds in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Gerv. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng.</NOTE> money, besides plate and jewels. This enabled him to conciliate the minds of the soldiery, and make suitable presents to the nobility and prelates; and his brother having engaged Roger, bishop of Salisbury, in his interest, nothing was wanting to his coronation, but the consent of William, archbisnop of Can∣terbury, whose right and office it was to perform that ceremony. He being a conscientious primate, who scrupled to commit a flagrant breach of the oath he
<PB N="279" REF="2880"/>
had taken to the empress; Hugh Bigod, steward of the late king's houshold, who was not quite so squeamish, removed his scruples, by swearing that Henry had, upon his death-bed, disinherited Maud, who had disobliged him, and appointed Stephen his heir. This objection being surmounted, the archbishop complied, and placed the crown upon his head at Westminster, in a very thin assembly of barons, who took the oath of allegiance to Stephen, qualifying their perjury to∣wards<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Stephen, notwithstanding all his advantages and popularity, resolved to secure the favour of the nation, by some extraordinary concession; and there∣fore, over and above his promise of ruling with equity and moderation, for which his brother of Winchester interposed his word and credit, he assembled a general council of the barons at Oxford, when he solemnly swore of his own free motion, that he would not retain vacant sees and benefices in his hands, but<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>After having paid the last honours to the corpse of Henry, which was brought over from Normandy, and interred with great magnificence in the ab∣bey of Reading, he raised a body of Breton and Flemish soldiers, to defend his government from any attempts that might be made in favour of Maud; and as he could refuse nothing to the nobility who had so readily concurred in exalting him to the throne, he granted a general license to all noblemen and military te∣nants<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.

<P>It was not without great reason he took precautions for his own safety. He was elected rather by a cabal of prelates and noblemen, than by a general consent of the nation; in which there was a great number of noblemen who waited only for a proper opportunity to manifest their attachment to the em∣press. She had already been proclaimed by her uncle David, king of Scotland, who had overrun the provinces of Cumberland and Northumberland, reduced all the towns and fortresses in the north, except Bambury, and compelled the gentry and inhabitants, as far as Durham, to swear allegiance to Maud, and give hostag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for their fidelity. Stephen was no sooner informed of these pro∣ceedings than he marched against the Scot; and the two armies met in the neighbourhood of Durham. Both princes seemed more inclined to a negocia∣tion than a battle; and proposals being exchanged, they concluded a treaty, importing, that David should restore all the places he had taken, except Car∣lisle, which he retained as part of Cumberland, and for which David's son Hen∣ry did homage to Stephen, who presented this young prince with the earldom
<PB N="280" REF="2890"/>

<P>This northern storm being overblown, all the kingdom enjoyed undi∣sturbed repose, except the boundaries of Wales possessed by the English, which were infested by the incursions of the natives, who commited terrible outrages<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor Wigors. Cout.</NOTE> until a peace was concluded; and then they submitted to Stephen. His throne being now to all appearance established, Robert, earl of Gloucester, the late king's natural son, arrived in England. He was the most virtuous, ac∣complished, and popular nobleman in the kingdom, and a zealous adherent to the interests of the empress. He had remained in Normandy after his father's death, to execute his will, and confirm the Normans in their attachment to his daughter. But finding how easily Stephen had mounted the throne of England, and how satisfied the people were with his government, he resolved to tempo∣rize, and at his arrival took the oath of allegiance to Stephen, but with this express stipulation, that he should be no longer bound by it, than the k ng continued to rule according to the promises he had made. Robert did not at all doubt that the obligation would soon be void, and then he might with a safe con∣science take measures in behalf of his sister. This method of qualifying was adopted by all the other noblemen who had hitherto kept aloof; and Stephen having procured the pope's confirmation of his title, in order to settle the squeamish consciences of some pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, who had hitherto witheld their homage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Huntingdon.

<P>To demonstrate his good will in this particular, he granted a charter at Oxford, confirming the immunities of the church, disclaiming all simo∣niacal promotions; referring the persons and estates of ecclesiastics to the cognizance of spiritual courts only; securing the free enjoyment of all the pos∣sessions belonging to the church at the death of the Conqueror; promising restitution of what had been alienated, and renouncing all profit arising from va∣cant<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

Nor was he more scrupulous in performing the promises he had made to the laity; for, instead of granting free liberty of hunting, he prosecuted the nobility on the forest laws<NOTE PLACE="marg">H.

<P>Geoffry of Anjou, the husband of Maud, as soon as he could assemble his troops after the decease of the king, had entered that dutchy, and made himself
<PB N="281" REF="2900"/>
master of several towns by the assistance of William de Talevas, count of Pon∣thieu; but an irreconcileable grudge subsisting between the Normans and the Angevins, the nobility of Normandy assembled at Newbourg, and offered the dutchy to Theobald count of Blois. To this prince, Robert, earl of Gloucester, delivered Falaise before his departure, in hope of promoting a contention between the brothers, which might be advantageous to the empress. The Norman no∣blemen understanding that Stephen was in quiet possession of the English throne, and being unwilling to lose the estates they possessed in England, sent Theobald home in great indignation, and offered their service to Stephen. But far from being unanimous in their proceedings, the dutchy was divided into factions, which produced a civil war and universal desolation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Stephen, finding his presence would be necessary to quiet these dis∣turbances, set sail for Normandy, and being joined at La Hogue by the count de Blois, visited Lewis the young, king of France, with whom a treaty was con∣cluded, on condition that Eustace son of Stephen should marry the French king's sister Constance, and be invested by his brother-in-law with the dutchy of Norman∣dy. Then Stephen, assembling his forces, resolved to attack the count of Anjou, who had taken several places, and retired to Argentan, after having made an un∣successful attempt to surprize Caen; but when the king had advanced as far as Lisieux, a quarrel broke out between William d' Ypres, earl of Kent, and Renaud de St. Valery, about the chief command: the Boulonnois and Flemings in the army espousing the cause of William, and the Normans declaring for their countryman Renaud, a battle ensued, and a great deal of blood was shed on both sides. Whether Stephen on this occasion favoured the foreign troops, in which he placed his chief confidence, or his favourite William d' Ypres was so detested by the Normans that they would not serve under his command; certain it is, they abandoned his army; nor could Stephen, who overtook them at Ponteau de Mer, prevail upon their leaders Hugh de Gournay and young William de Warenne to return to their duty. Perplexed therefore in his own mind, and sus∣pecting the fidelity of all his Norman subjects, he was fain to purchase a truce for two years with Geoffrey Plantagenet, with an annuity of five thousand marks for him, and another of two thousand for his own brother Theobald de Blois, in lieu of his pretensions to the dutchy. Notwithstanding this accommodation, the civil war still continued to rage among the Norman nobility; but Stephen, leaving William de Roumara and the viscount Roger to appease these troubles, returned to England; while Robert, earl of Leicester, who had followed him into Normandy, stayed behind, partly because he did not care to trust himself in England with Stephen, who had already betrayed his jealousy of Robert's con∣duct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ger. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wig.

<P>Stephen was recalled to England, to quell a conspiracy, which had been formed for massacring all the foreigners, expelling the Normans, and fixing the crown upon the head of David, king of Scotland, the next lineal heir of the Saxon kings. This project was the effect of despair, to which the English were driven by the licentiousness and oppression exercised by the foreign mercenaries, who plundered and burned the towns and villages, and imprisoned, tortured, and even murdered the wretched people with impunity, under chiefs who had built and erected castles for the purposes of rapine. Nothing could exceed the misery
<PB N="282" REF="2910"/>
of England at this period, when free-born Englishmen became the prey of such petty tyrants, saw their effects pillaged, their limbs loaded with shackles, their wives and daughters violated, their habitations burned, and their families perishing with hunger. In such a dreadful situation, no wonder they took some desperate resolution, against a foreign usurper, to whom they were bound by no ties of conscience or gratitude. Nigel, bishop of Ely, was the first friend of Ste∣phen who detected the plot, and communicated the particulars to the prelates and nobility; and Stephen was no sooner informed of the disign than he returned<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1138.</NOTE> to England with great expedition. Some of the conspirators were taken, con∣victed, and executed; while others retired from the kingdom before they were accused, and the more powerful stood in their defence, treating with the Scots and Welsh for assistance. The sons of Robert Beauchamp, hearing the king had given part of their inheritance to Hugh le Poer, as a portion with the daughter of Simon Beauchamp, whom he had married, fortified the castle of Bedford, which was immediately invested by Stephen, who finding it too strong to be easily re∣duced, had recourse to the mediation of his brother, the bishop of Winchester, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

</DIV4>

<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while David, king of Scotland, having been formally refused possession of Northumberland, to which he laid claim, invaded the northern parts of England; and Stephen marching with a strong army to oppose his progress, the Scots retired to Roxburgh, where the king finding them too advantageously posted to be attacked with any prospect of success, and discovering some treachery among his followers, retreated to the south, without having hazarded an action. The Scots were then at liberty to waste Northumberland with impunity; they took Norham, and dividing into different detachments, ravaged the whole country, committing every where the most ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>barous outrages. At length, when the sum∣mer was far advanced, their scattered parties joining, they advanced as far as Bag∣gamoor, about two miles from Northallerton in Yorkshire, where they were met by an English army, under the command of William, earl of Albemarle, accom∣panied with Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pec, Roger Mowbray, Robert de Bruce, Bernard de Baliol, Walter de Gant, and all the northern barons. In a sort of a wheel-car∣riage they had erected a long pole, at the top of which was a cross, and under this a banner, from whence the battle that ensued acquired the name of the bat∣tle of the standard. Around this ensign the English were drawn up in a firm compacted body, the front being composed of pikemen and archers intermixed, to receive the first shock of the enemy. There was a dispute in the Scottish army about the manner in which they should begin the attack: David and his princi∣pal nobility were of opinion they should charge with their heavy-armed troops and bowmen; but the men of Galloway, who had no other than slight offensive weapons, insisted upon the privilege of forming the van; and the dispute grow∣ing warm between Alan de Percy and the earl of Stratherne, the king, in order to prevent a mutiny, ordered the Gallovidians to take their post, and begin the battle. The second line was composed of the borderers and lowlanders, com∣manded by the prince of Scotland, under the direction of Eustace Fitzjohn, an English nobleman, who had been oppressed by Stephen, and joined the Scots from resentment. The body of reserve consisted of the highlanders and Mur∣raymen, commanded by the king, attended by a body guard of English and Nor∣man knights. The Gallo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idians marched up to the attack with three huzzas,
<PB N="283" REF="2920"/>
and charged the English lancemen with such fury that they gave ground; but they were sustained by the second line; and the assailants, having no defen∣sive armour, were galled in such a manner by the English arrows and push of pike, that their first fire being exhausted, and their two chieftains Ulgerick and Donald slain, they turned their backs and fled with great confusion. The prince of Scotland then advanced to the attack with such impetuosity that he bore down all before him, and even penetrated to the rear of the English, who, ter∣rified at his success, began to fall into disorder, and gave way, when their total defeat was prevented by the stratagem of an old soldier, who cutting off a man's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, erected it on the point of his spear, and calling aloud, "Behold the head of the Scotch king," rallied the troops and renewed the battle. The Scots, con∣founded at this apparition, and dispirited by the flight of the Gallovidians, fought no longer with alacrity, but began to give ground on all quarters: nor could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rieval de Bel.

<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The fugitives, seeing the royal banner still displayed, were convinced of their king's being alive, and crouded around him in such numbers, that he was able to form a considerable body, with which he retreated in good order to Carlile, where he was on the third day after the battle, joined by his son. The prince, finding himself with a few soldiers in the heart of the English army during the engagement, had thrown away his badges of distinction, and mixed with the enemy, until he made shift to escape through bye-ways to his father, who was disconsolate at his being missing; and therefore thought himself happy in his return. David lost some thousands, not in the battle, but in the retreat of scattered parties, who, instead of joining the royal banner, endeavoured to escape into their own country, and were massacred by the inhabitants of the country through which they marched. Stephen was so well pleased with this victory, that he conferred upon William of Albemarle the additional title of Yorkshire, and bestowed the earldom of Derby on Ferrers, by whom the other had been so strong∣ly reinforced. David was not so weakened or dejected by his defeat, but that he besieged the castle of Werk; which he reduced by famine, nor would he be per∣suaded to make peace with Stephen, by all the remonstrances of the pope's legate Albericus, bishop of Ostia, sent to England by Innocent II. to exercise a legatine jurisdiction, and visit all the monasteries and cathedrals in the kingdom. All that Albericus could obtain of David, was a suspension of hostilities for some months, during which, however, Stephen's queen Maud, who was David's niece, employed her good offices so effectually that a treaty of peace was next year concluded at Durham, on condition that all the county of Northumberland should be ceded to Henry, prince of Scotland, except New-Castle and Bamburgh, in lieu of which he should enjoy certain lands in the southern parts of the kingdom. Hostages be∣ing given for the performance of the articles, the barons of Northumberland did homage to the Scottish prince, who attended queen Maud to Nottingham, where she was met by her husband. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<P>During these northern transactions, Stephen had been employed in quelling divers insurrections in different parts of the kingdom. He had heaped such extraordinary favours upon his minister William d' Y pres and other foreign∣ers, as gave great umbrage to the English nobility, who took no pains to hide their discontent, and their murmurs attracted the jealousy of the king, who upon
<PB N="284" REF="2930"/>
slight furmizes seized their persons and estates. Others, to avoid the like treat∣ment, put themselves in a posture of defence; and among the rest Robert, earl of Gloucester, to whom the late king had granted the castles of Dover, Ledes, and Bristol, which Stephen now resolved to reduce. The first was surrendered by Walchelm, the governor, at the persuasion of Gilbert Strongbow, who was for this piece of service created earl of Pembroke; Ledes was besieged and taken; but all the king's attempts upon Bristol proved ineffectual. Robert, think∣ing it now high time to pull off the mask, sent letters from Normandy to Stephen, upbraiding him with breach of faith and perjury towards Maud the empress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1139.</NOTE> and denouncing war against him as an usurper. To this defiance the king made no answer, but ordered Robert's estates to be confiscated. Geoffrey de Talebot was driven out of Hereford, to which he had retired; Shrewsbury was taken by storm, and Arnulf de Heslin the governor put to death, with ninety persons of the garrison; others, terrified by Stephen's success and severity, sub∣mitted; but Paynel still holding out in Ludlow, the king marched from Not∣tingham against that fortress, attended by the prince of Scotland, who in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The garrison made such a vigorous defence that he was obliged to turn the siege into a blockade, by raising two forts in the neighbourhood; then he returned to Oxford, where he took a step that recovered his interest with the clergy. From the letter he had received in such outrageous terms from Robert, earl of Gloucester, he concluded that the storm which had been long gathering was ready to burst; and that all the persons of distinction in England, who had been attached to the late king, were concerned in the con∣spiracy against his crown. One of the most powerful of these was Roger, bishop of Salisbury, who had been raised by Henry from a simple cure in Nor∣mandy to the see of Sarum, and such a share of that king's confidence that he in a manner governed the whole kingdom, and acquired vast wealth and influ∣ence, which he afterwards employed against the daughter and heir of his be∣nefactor, in favour of an usurper, by whom he was neglected. At length, he incurred the suspicion of Stephen, because he had, in consequence of the general permission, fortified old Sarum, and built the castles of Sherburn, Malmesbury, and the Devizes; while his nephew Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, erected those<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> of Newark and Sleford. The king, therefore, at his return to Oxford, invited and required his presence at court, on pretence of consulting him in some affair of consequence: he accordingly went thither, accompanied by his two nephews the bishops of Lincoln and Ely, and was immediately taken into custody with Alex∣ander until they should deliver up their castles. Nigel, bishop of Ely, who lodged in the suburbs, made his escape to the Devizes, which William d'Ypres was sent immediately to besiege; but, the place making a stout resistance, Ro∣ger was brought in person before it, and threatened with death, should they re∣fuse to surrender. This expedient produced the desired effect. Nigel capitulated for his own liberty, and Stephen taking possession, found a treasure amounting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ord.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>This exploit excited a general clamour over all the nation: and Ste∣phen's brother Henry, bishop of Winchester, who was invested with a legatine power, thinking it incumbent upon him to vindicate the privileges of the clergy,
<PB N="285" REF="2940"/>
summoned the king to attend a synod which he convened at Winchester, in order to take cognizance of this affair. Stephen sent thither some earls, together with Aubrey de Ver, an eloquent orator, who undertook to justify the king's con∣duct, by observing that the bishop of Salisbury had raised a sedition at Oxford, in which a knight of Bretagne had lost his life and many subjects been grie∣vously wounded, even under the eye of their sovereign; that he secretly favoured the enemies of the government, and intended to declare for the empress on her landing in England; that he was seized not as a bishop but in quality of the king's servant; that the castles were not taken by force, but given as a composition for the penalty incurred by raising the tumult at Oxford; and that his treasure had been embezzled from the exchequer of the late king, consequently belonged to his successor. With respect to the bishop of Lincoln, nothing was laid to his charge but his being concerned in the fray at Oxford, which was purposely raised about lodg∣ings, by Alain, count of Dinan, that the king might have a pretence for arrest∣ing the bishops. To these articles Roger made such a distinct and substantial an∣swer, that Henry insisted upon the restoration of the castles; and the session was, at Stephen's request, adjourned till next day, when Hugh, archbishop of Rouen, af∣firmed that no bishops were allowed by the canons to maintain castles; and Au∣brey de Ver representing in very strong colours the mischiefs that might accrue to the members of the synod from the king's resentment, in case they should ex∣communicate Stephen, or appeal to Rome, as Henry had threatened to do, they broke up without proceeding to any sentence, and Stephen kept the castles he had thus acquired; while Roger died of grief and vexation, and the whole kingdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>It was certainly the most impolitic step he could have taken, at such a juncture, when he was threatened with such a dangerous invasion from abroad. The truce with Geoffrey Plantagenet being expired, that prince marched into the Contantin, the greatest part of which he reduced to his obedience; Robert, earl of Gloucester, put him in possession of Caen and Bayeux; and he proceeded with long strides towards an intire conquest of Normandy. To facilitate this enter∣prize, Robert resolved to attend Maud into England, where a great number of partizans were ready to rise at her arrival. To prepare for her reception she sent over Baldwin de Redvers, who landing at Wareham took possession of Corfe castle, which was immediately invested by Stephen: but, hearing that the empress intended an immediate descent, he raised the siege in order to re∣duce some places that lay in her way from the sea-coast to Gloucestershire, in which the greatest number of her friends had acted. He was employed in the siege of Marlborough, when he received intelligence that Maud and her bro∣ther had landed at Arundel, and were admitted into the castle by Adelais, wi∣dow of the late king, now married to William de Albeney, earl of Sussex.</P>

<P>Thither Stephen immediately marched, and found that Robert, earl of Gloucester, had already set out with twelve knights for Bristol, leaving the empress with her stepmother, who at the king's approach, sent an apology for having received her daughter-in-law in the way of hospitality, and protested that she had no design to encourage an insurrection. Stephen, considering the strength of Arundel castle, which was deemed impregnable, and that it would be more easy to maintain the was in one place than in two different provinces, not only admit∣ted the excuses of the queen-mother, but also allowed Maud to join the earl of

The earl of Gloucester, with the assistance of this gallant nobleman, who had great possessions in Herefordshire, and the counties of Gloucester and Brecknock; and Brian Fitz-Comte, lord of Overwent and Abergavenny, was enabled to raise a body of ten thousand men to support the cause of the empress; while the clergy disposed the minds of the people in her favour.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Stephen, with a view to suppress this commotion before his enemies could assemble their forces, took the field immediately, and forming the block∣ade of Wallingford, by means of two forts erected to over-awe the garrison, he invested Troubridge, which was so bravely defended by Humphry de Bohun, that after his soldiers had suffered innumerable hardships and fatigues, he was fain to raise the siege, and retire to London, leaving a strong garrison in the Devizes, to oppose the excursions of the enemy, who had by this time destroyed his forts before Wallingford, and burned Worcester. Stephen now saw the bad effects of allowing every petty nobleman to fortify castles. There was scarce a parish in the kingdom without some strength of this kind, which served as a refuge to villainy and oppression, by which the people were impoverished, and the collectors of taxes set at defiance: so that the king had no other way of fill∣ing his coffers, but that of clipping and adulterating the coin, and setting up to sale all the posts, places, and benefices of the nation. At the same time he stuck at nothing to make himself master of the forts belonging to those noble∣men whom he suspected of disaffection. He made no scruple of arresting them without any cause assigned, and compelling them to redeem their liberty, by delivering up their strong holds; a species of tyranny in which he was encou∣raged and assisted by his brother, the bishop of Winchester, who aggravated in∣justice with a scandalous breach of hospitality, by inviting a number of noble∣men<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>The earl of Gloucester, by his vast power and credit, had engaged a great number of the nobility in Maud's interest; and others, whom he could not bring over, he prevailed upon to be quiet. He effected a match between his bro∣ther Reginald and the daughter of William Fitz-Richard, a powerful noble∣man in Cornwal, who delivering the king's castles, and the greatest part of the county, to his son-in-law, Reginald, otherwise called Renaud de Dunstanville, was created earl of Cornwal by the empress. Stephen was no sooner apprized of this transaction, than he marched thither with all expedition, and recovering some of the fortresses, left count Alain with a body of troops for their defence,

and narrowly avoided Robert, who had laid a scheme for intercepting him in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gest. Reg. Steph.</NOTE> his return.</P>

<P>The whole kingdom was now become a scene of mischief, misery, and confusion. Every province, town, and individual, declaring for one or other of the competitors. Neighbours, and even families, were divided into fac∣tions; and the whole country was filled with rapine, cruelty, and bloodshed. The barons assumed separately a sovereign power, oppressed the people, and even coined money in their own castles. Maud was obliged to connive at the violence and irregularity of her friends, to secure their adherence; and as Stephen could not pay his foreign mercenaries, they were allowed to live at free quarter, and commit the most terrible outrages. In this deplorable anarchy, every moderate person in the kingdom sighed for peace; and Henry, bishop of Winchester, proposed a treaty. The conferences were opened in the neighbour∣hood of Bath, and the empress seemed willing to refer the dispute to the arbi∣tration of the bishops; but Stephen refused his assent to this proposal, because he expected no justice or impartiality from a set of people whom he had so mor∣tally offended. The bishop of Winchester requested the mediation of the French king, and Stephen's elder brother Theobald, count de Blois, and going over to the continent for that purpose, brought back propositions to which the em∣press took no exception; but Stephen, after having procrastinated his answer for a considerable time, at length rejected them entirely, and the war was renewed with various success. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malmesh.</NOTE></P>

<P>The earl of Gloucester had taken Nottingham; and his son-in∣law Ralf de Gernons, earl of Chester, surprised the castle of Lincoln, in which he proposed to spend the Christmas holidays, with his wife and his half brother, William de Roumara. The inhabitants of the town, who favoured Stephen, giving that prince to understand how easily he might surprize three enemies of such consequence, he put himself at the head of his troops, and marched on Christmas-day with such diligence, that the castle was invested before Ralf had the least intimation of his approach: he found means however to break through Stephen's guards in the night, and repairing to the earl of Gloucester, made him acquainted with the situation of his daughter, and begged he would lose no time in marching to her relief, as the castle was in no condition to sustain a siege.</P>

<P>Robert immediately assembled his troops, and took the route to Lincoln, with his son-in-law, at the head of his vassals and some auxiliary Welch forces, and resolving to strike a decisive blow, passed a rivulet and morass, which Stephen deemed imprac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icable, and gave him battle without hesitation. The infantry, commanded by himself in person, composed the center; the horse were formed into two wings, one of which consisted of those who had been de∣prived of their honours and estates by Stephen; and the other was made up of Ralf's vassals, under his own conduct; while the Welch, who were unprovided with defensive armour, constituted a separate body, posted at the extremity of the line. Stephen drew up his army in the same manner; one wing of Flemish and Breton c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>valry, commanded by William d'Ypres and the earl of Albemarle; the other, composed of Bretons and English, under count Alain of Dinan, Wal∣leran de Mellent, Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, Simon de Seules and William de Warenne, earls of Northampton and Surrey; and the king himself on foot,
<PB N="288" REF="2970"/>
in the center. William d' Ypres began the battle by attacking the Welch, who were easily routed: but the earl of Chester seeing them disordered in the pursuit, charged them in flank, and broke them intirely, so as that they never rallied. At the same time the English on the other wing of Gloucester's army, fired by their wrongs, threw away their lances, and fell in sword in hand among Ste∣phen's cavaliers, who did not stand the first onset, but fled in the utmost confu∣sion. Stephen, being thus left naked to the right and left, was surrounded by the enemy; and though he acted the part of an able general, and for a long time sustained the battle against extraordinary odds and efforts, he was at length obliged to yield to the adverse fortune of the day. He fought with inconceiv∣able fury, until his battle-ax was broke to pieces; then drawing his sword he defended himself against a whole multitude, foaming with rage to see himself abandoned by his soldiers: in this unequal fight he shivered his sword to pieces, and still fought with his truncheon, until he received a blow with a stone, which felled him to the ground; yet he started up again upon his knees; but before he could rise, a knight called William de Kaines, springing forward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1141.</NOTE> and seizing his crest presented the point of his sword, and threatened to put him instantly to death, if he would not surrender. Notwithstanding the extremity to which he was reduced, he refused to yield to any person but the duke of Glou∣cester, who, being near the spot, came up and took him prisoner, together<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.

<P>Immediately after this decisive battle, William Peverel surrendered the castle of Nottingham to the empress; those of the Devizes and Bedford were yielded to her at the same time; and the earl of Warwick and all England abandoned the captive king, except the city of London and the county of Kent, in which William of Ypres his favourite, and some other partizans, still adhered to his queen, and son Eustace. Such barons, as still preserved their allegiance, entered into the corporations and common-council of London, and prevailed upon them to form an association in favour of the king. Though the greatest part of the kingdom had declared for Maud, she found still an obstacle to her ascending the throne; and that was Henry, bishop of Winchester, invested by the pope with legatine power, which placed him at the head of the clergy, whose resolutions, on such an occasion, would have a great influence on the people and the nobility. In order to detach this prelate from his brother's interest, she vi∣sited him at Winchester, and promised to be guided wholly by his counsels, and even to leave the vacant bishoprics to his disposal. These were temp∣tations which he could not resist. He promised to abandon his brother, and devote himself entirely to her service; as a proof of his sincerity, he swore allegiance to her in private, though it was a conditional oath, binding him no longer than she should continue to act according to her promise. Next day he received her with great solemnity in the cathedral church, where he ex∣communicated all the partisans of Stephen, and offered absolution to all those who should forsake him, and espouse the cause of the empress. Henry's exam∣ple was followed by the archbishop of Canterbury, who did not however take the oaths to Maud, until he had obtained the consent of the king, whom he vi∣sited<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>The legate having undertaken to bring the clergy over to Maud's interest, assembled a general council at Winchester, and before the opening of the session conferred with every member in private, to prepare him for the de∣claration he intended to make. The council being assembled, he pronounced a studied harangue, in which he observed, that the tyranny, bad faith, and misconduct of Stephen, were the real sources of all the troubles that afflicted the nation. He owned that he himself had engaged his word for him, when the circumstances of affairs made it necessary to raise him to the throne: but he had been grievously mistaken in his opinion of the man, and it was with unfeign∣ed sorrow he found himself obliged to renounce that engagement. He remind∣ed them of the first oath he had taken to the empress; and said it was more righteous to obey the order of God almighty, who had declared in favour of that princess, than to sacrifice his duty to the interests and ambition of a carnal brother, whom he had done all that lay in his power to reclaim, though with∣out effect; that the judgment of heaven having overtaken him whom they had chosen, they ought to make atonement for their fault, in restoring the crown to the lawful heiress; and that, after having deliberated with the principal members of the clergy, upon measures for putting a stop to the calamities of the nation, he had, by virtue of the apostolic power with which he was invested, thought proper to acknowledge Maud, daughter of the late king Henry, queen and so∣vereign of England.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>All the members, who had not been privately closeted, were in∣finitely surprised at this declaration; but as no individual would venture to ex∣press his dislike, the legate interpreted their silence into approbation, and gave them to understand, that he had summoned the Londoners to this council, where they promised to appear. Next day the deputies from that city ar∣rived; but, far from approving of the new election, they demanded, in the name of their constituents, that the king should be set at liberty. The legate replied, that it ill became the citizens of London to associate with those barons who had so basely abandoned their king in battle; and whose sole aim was to involve the country in fresh troubles. The deputies demanded a categorical answer, which however they could not obtain; and therefore they protested against the transactions of the council. A chaplain belonging to Stephen's queen presented a letter to the legate from that princess; but as he did not choose to communicate the contents to the assembly, he restored it to the bearer, who read it aloud. The purport of this address was to demand her husband's en∣largement; but it met with no regard from the audience; and the session was concluded with the sentence of excommunication denounced against all Stephen's adherents. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Nothing was now wanting to complete the triumph of the em∣press, except the concurrence of the city of London, which was at length ob∣tained by the endeavours of her brother Robert, who had been hitherto her chief director and support. During this negociation she resided at St. Alban's, where she was visited by her uncle David, king of Scotland, who had come to assist at her coronation; and, as soon as she understood that her party had prevailed in the capital, she set out for that city, where she was received as sovereign. Having exacted the oath of allegiance from the citizens, she began to prepare
<PB N="290" REF="2990"/>
for her coronation; and in this interval Stephen's queen implored her generosity and mercy in behalf of that unfortunate prince, who, in consideration of obtain∣ing his liberty, offered to renounce all pretensions to the crown, to leave the kingdom, or even spend his days in a monastery; nay, he proposed to bind himself by oath, and give hostages for the performance of his promise. These proposals were rejected with great disdain, and the empress forbad Mathilda, in a very insulting manner, to trouble her with such sollicitations for the future.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The request of that unhappy princess had been seconded by Hen∣ry, bishop of Winchester, who thought himself intitled to some degree of fa∣vour with the empress; but he found himself disappointed in his expectation. He had asked the counties of Boulogne and Montague, for Stephen's son Eu∣stace, and met with a peremptory denial, which was so opposite to the profes∣sions of Maud before her election, that he perceived he had nothing to hope from her good-will or condescension. He therefore deemed himself acquitted of his engagement, and began to project schemes of revenge, which she herself facilitated by her pride and imperious conduct. Instead of conciliating the af∣fections of her subjects by affability and popular concessions, she affected to treat them as slaves born for her service. She intailed upon herself the hatred of the Londoners, in rejecting their remonstrance, when they entreated her to miti∣gate the severe laws of the Norman princes, and revive those of the Confessor; a favour with which she ought in policy to have indulged her people, unfollicited. The citizens did not fail to murmur at this instance of her haughty and inflexi∣ble disposition; the nation began to pity the distress of Stephen and his family; they recognized and trembled at the spirit of the Conqueror, which manifested i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self so early in the deportment of his grand-daughter; and they heartily repent∣ed the steps they had taken in her favour.</P>

<P>The bishop of Winchester in secret fomented their discontent, and finding it ripe for tumult, directed his nephew Eustace to take the field, under the auspices of William d' Ypres, who assembled a body of Kentishmen for his service. With these he advanced into Surrey, and blocking up London on the side of Southwark, sent detached parties to make excursions on the other side of the river, and ravage the country to the very suburbs. In order to co-ope∣rate with these proceedings, the Londoners, instigated by the bishop's emissa∣ries, formed a conspiracy for seizing the person of the empress, who being ac∣cidently informed of their purpose, retired with great precipitation, attended by her uncle David, her brother Gloucester, and Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, whom she had by this<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

Though her person escaped, her furniture was plundered by the populace, and her character treated openly with the most inde∣cent rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oach. While she hastened to Oxford, in order to assemble an army, the bishop retired to Winchester, where he fortified his palace, and took mea∣sures with the disaffected party for augmenting the forces of his nephew; though he did not yet openly declare himself an enemy to the empress. He could not, however, with all his caution, elude her sus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icion; and her brother Robert visited him at Winchester, on purpose to found his sentiments: he could plainly perceive that prelate was estranged from his sister's interest; and indeed be had no reason to expect any other consequence from the rude, ungrateful manner, in which she had slighted his mediation, and rejected his request.</P>

<P>Being now convinced of his disaffection, she repaired suddenly to Winchester, with a flying party of horse, and alighting at the king's castle, sent a message to him announcing her arrival, and desiring to see him directly, that she might consult him about some affairs of the last importance. The bishop, who at once perceived her drift, returned an ambiguous answer, that he was getting ready as fast as he could; but instead of going to the palace, he forthwith quitted the town, and assembled his friends, who were prepared to join him on the first notice. The troops of Kent and the militia of London being already in the field under the command of Stephen's queen and his son, directed by William d'Ypres, they marched forthwith to Winchester with such expedition, that Maud's uncle David and her brother, with the earl of Hereford, and a few troops assembled in a hurry, had scarce time to reinforce her in the castle before she found her∣self besieged. Henry was joined by a number of young nobility, flushed with<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmesb.</NOTE> spirits and ambition, who seized this opportunity of retrieving the reputation they had lost in the battle of Lincoln, and executed Henry's resentment against the inhabitants of Winchester, who had exhibited some marks of affection for the empress. In order to punish them for this unlucky attachment, their good bishop ordered wildfire and combustibles to be thrown by engines from his castle upon the town, so as to produce a conflagration, that reduced great part of it to ashes, and among other buildings, consumed a nunnery and twenty churches within the walls, and in the suburbs the abbey of Hyde, from which, however, the bishop reserved for his own use a massy golden cup studded with stones, the gift of King Canute, and three royal diadems, with stands of the purest Arabian gold, adorned with jewels, and curious workmanship. While the holy legate thus rained fire and destruction on his flock, William d' Ypres acted the same tragedy at Andover, and burned the nunnery of Warewell, to which some of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contin.

<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' the castle of Winchester was now closely besieged by an army amounting to sixty thousand men, David, king of Scotland, and Robert, earl of Gloucester, made such a vigorous defence, that after the assailants had carried on their operations above six weeks, they retained very little hope of reducing the be∣sieged by force of arms; the pious bishop therefore had recourse to a stratagem, by which he turned religion to good account. On the eve of Holy rood day, he ordered peace to be proclaimed in the town, and the gates to be set wide open, inviting all persons foes as well as friends to celebrate that great festival of christianity without fear of interruption. Though earl Robert did not altogether depend upon the pre∣late's sincerity, yet as their provision was quite exhausted, and famine must have compelled them to surrender in a few days at discretion, he resolved, with the consent of David, to make an attempt for conveying the empress to a place of safety. With this view he committed her to the charge of her brother Reginald, earl of Cornwal, supported by the best part of the garris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, with direction to make the best of their way towards the Devizes, while he himself followed with a choice party of two hundred men, to amuse the enemy, in case they should attempt to in∣tercept her. With this guard the empress set out on horseback, and had not proceeded a great way when William d' Ypres began the pursuit. The earl of Gloucester and David interposed, and made such a gallant defence that Maud ac∣complished her escape to the castle of Lutgershal in Wiltshire; which finding un∣provided and indefensible, she was obliged to disguise herself in man's apparel, and ride forward to the Devizes, where she arrived so fatigued that she could not prose∣cute
<PB N="292" REF="3010"/>
her journey without some repose. Mean while the king of Scots made his escape to his own country, by the fidelity of David Oliphant; and Robert, earl of Glou∣cester, having retarded the enemy a considerable time, was at length overpowered at Trowbridge, and taken prisoner. A body was immediately sent in pursuit of the empress, who finding no safety at the Devizes, and understanding the whole adjacent country was in possession of the enemy, allowed herself to be inclosed in a bier, which passed along unfuspected, and conveyed her to Gloucester, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hagul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tad.

<P>Robert was no sooner in the hands of Stephen's party than they exerted all their endeavours to debauch him from the cause of his sister; they offered him the government of the whole realm, under Stephen, if he would em∣brace the interest of that prince; and, finding him deaf to their promises, threatened to send him beyond sea, and commit him close prisoner in Boulogne. He was equally unmoved by their menaces and flattery, and bore his captivity with the most heroic fortitude. Then they proposed that he should be exchanged for Stephen; but this proposition he rejected as an unfair exchange, unless they would at the same time release all the persons of distinction they had taken; so as to make up the difference between his rank and that of Stephen. This expedient, how∣ever, was rejected by William d' Ypres, who would not part with the prospect of ransom. At length, as Robert was the soul of his sister's cause, she agreed that he should be exchanged for Stephen, whom nevertheless she would not release un∣til his queen surrendered herself as an hostage for the liberty of Gloucester. This precaution being taken Stephen was dismissed, and arrived at Winchester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Malmes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> where he had an interview with Robert, whom he endeavoured in vain to seduce. This nobleman on the contrary, no sooner recovered his freedom than he applied himself with redoubled diligence to the re-establishment of his sister's affairs: while the legate convoked a council, in which, after Stephen had made a speech, complain∣ing of his imprisonment and the infidelity of his subjects, the bishop made an aukward apology for the inconsistency of his own conduct, by imputing it to the necessity of the times. He said the empress had not only broke the stipulations she had made with him before her election, but likewise formed designs against his life and dignity; and concluded with a sentence of excommunication denounced against all disturbers of the peace, who favoured the cause of the countess of Anjou. Howsoever shocked the ecclesiastical members of this assem∣bly were at this instance of the bishop's arrogance and inconsistency, there was no person present who would venture to express his sentiments, except a lay deputy sent thither by Maud, who in the name of that princess loudly taxed him with perjury and rebellion; affirming that she had come to England by his invitation, and detained Stephen in prison in consequence of his advice: a charge to which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<P>Maud mean while held a council at the Devizes, in which it was resolved that the count of Anjou should be invited to come over and take the ma∣nagement of his wife's affairs; but he declined the invitation, until he should have a conference with the earl of Gloucester, who at first refused to leave the king∣dom at a juncture when his presence was so necessary; but at length yielded to the importunities of his sister and her friends; and leaving her at Oxford, was accompanied in his voyage by a number of young noblemen, whom he carried along with him as pledges for the fidelity of their parents. He em∣barked
<PB N="293" REF="3020"/>
at Wareham, and after a dangerous passage arrived at Caen, where he was met by Geoffrey Plantagenet, who among other objections to his crossing the sea mentioned that of his being obliged to stay and reduce some castles in Normandy. Robert assisted him in subduing these fortresses, and still he found other excu∣ses; so that the earl perceiving him altogether averse to the voyage, prevailed upon him to send over his eldest son Henry, whose presence would animate the English to exert themselves in supporting his mother.</P>

<P>About the time of the earl's departure from England, Stephen had been seized with a dangerous fever, which reduced him to the brink of the grave; but, as soon as he recovered, he assembled a body of troops, and marching to Wareham, burned the town, and made himself master of the castle; then he di∣rected his march to Oxford, and arrived at that place so unexpectedly that he entered the city before any measures could be taken for its defence, and immedi∣ately invested the castle, in which the empress was cooped up with no other gar∣rison than her ordinary guard and the officers of her household. The noble∣men, who had engaged to defend her in her brother's absence, immediately assembled their forces, and advanced as far as Wallingford, to give battle to Ste∣phen; but he would not quit the city of Oxford, which was too well fortified for them to besiege with any prospect of success. Robert, being apprised of Maud's danger, embarked immediately for England, with her son Henry and four hun∣dred men at arms, and landing at Wareham invested the castle without delay, in expectation that Stephen would raise the siege of Oxford castle, and march to its relief; but that prince was so intent upon having the empress in his power that he would not interrupt his operations for one moment; so that the castle of Ware∣ham capitulated. From thence the earl marched to Cirencester, which he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Maud, taking advantage of this relaxation, came out at a postern gate, attended by four knights dressed in white, that they might not be easily distinguished from the snow, and crossing the river upon the ice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gest.

There she was visited by her brother and son, at sight of whom she forgot all her cares and distresses; and this young prince's education was committed to Robert, who conducted him to Bristol, where he continued four years under the tuition of the best masters. Mean while the castle of Oxford was surrendered to Stephen, who found himself extremely disappointed and chagrined at the escape<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Stephen opened the campaign in the spring with an expedition into the western counties, which his foreign mercenaries ravaged with great inhumanity; then he made an unsuccessful attempt upon the castle of Wareham, and marching from thence to Wilton, resolved to erect a fortress to hinder the excursions of the garrison of Salisbury. While he superintended this work,
<PB N="294" REF="3030"/>
the earl of Gloucester came upon him so suddenly that he had scarce time to draw out his forces, which were attacked in three different places, and routed after a slight opposition. Stephen himself had undergone such a rough trial of captivity, that rather than run the risque of being taken, he quitted the field before the action, with his brother the legate, leaving his plate and furniture a prey to the victor, who took a great number of prisoners, and among the rest<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.

<P>This officer's captivity was one of the greatest consequences of the victory, inasmuch as the castle of Sherburn was given up for his ransom; and about the same time Henry de Tracy, who had hitherto kept alive a party for Stephen in Devonshire, despairing of seeing that prince firmly settled on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Geft. Reg. Stephen.</NOTE> throne, made his peace with the empress, who now saw herself in possession of the whole kingdom of Wessex, except Hampshire; while her antagonist had only a precarious footing in other provinces, exclusive of the city of London, which continued staunch to his cause. That part of Wales inhabited by the English, and the counties lying on the side of the Severne, had declared for Maud, and obeyed her government. The bishopric of Durham and the three northern counties possessed by David, king of Scotland, acknowledged her sovereignty. William, earl of Yorkshire, who adhered to Stephen, was balanced by Alain, earl of Richmond; while Ralf, earl of Chester, Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, and the noblemen of East-Anglia, maintained a sort of independent regality within their several districts, though they were contented to recognize Stephen for their sovereign. The seat of the war therefore was chiefly confined to Berk∣shire and the parts adjacent, and carried on in sieges and blockades of castles, or slight shirmishes of detached parties; for Stephen was by this time disabled from<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Newb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig.</NOTE> assembling a royal army. His interest likewise sustained a rude shock in his bro∣ther's being deprived of his legatine power, which, upon the accession of Celestin II. to the pontificate, was given to Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, upon whose authority Henry, though his suffragan, had insolently encroached. The empress about the same time was afflicted with the loss of a faithful and conside∣rable adherent in the death of Milo, whom she had created earl of Hereford, a title that now devolved to his son Roger, who, though a nobleman of courage and fidelity, wanted the weight and experience of his father.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Stephen seems to have been infected with the rage of building castles; for he seldom attempted to take one fortress without building another, and the governors he appointed very often set up for themselves; so that he not only multiplied tyrants to oppress the country, but raised so many bulwarks against his own interest. He was also very much addicted to jealousy; and once his suspicion was aroused, he never waited for conviction, but took immediate steps for his own interest and convenience, without any regard to gratitude or justice. Geoffry de Magneville, a nobleman of great parts and vast possessions, he had created earl of Essex, and appointed governor of the Tower of London; but Stephen, giving ear to the suggestions of Geoffrey's enemies, who represented him as a secret favourer of the empress, caused him to be arrested at St. Alban's, on pretence of a tumult raised on purpose, and refused to release him until he had given up the Tower, as well as his own castles of Walden and Pleshy, near Dunmow in Essex. Whatever were Geoffry's sentiments before this injury, he now commenced the professed enemy of Stephen, and made a tender of his ser∣vices
<PB N="295" REF="3040"/>
to the empress, who confirmed his title, and appointed him hereditary high∣sheriff of London, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire. To approve himself worthy of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1144.</NOTE> these favours, he assembled a body of his friends and vassals, with which he de∣stroyed the city of Cambridge, and converted the abbey of Ramsey, into a garrison; then he retired to the fens, from which Stephen in person attempted to dislodge him, though without success. He was afterwards joined by Hugh Bigot, who declared for the empress; and these two noblemen ravaged the whole country, making excursions even to the neighbourhood of London, upon the citizens of which Stephen's chief dependence rested: at length Geoffrey was accidentally killed by an arrow at the siege of Burwelle castle: and Stephen marching against Bigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gest.

<P>This prince pursued the same perfidious and impolitic conduct with regard to Ralf, earl of Chester, who had made his accommodation, and assisted him with his forces on several occasions since his imprisonment. Notwithstand∣ing these proofs of his sincerity and attachment, he could not overcome the sus∣picion of Stephen, whose jealousy was founded upon his omitting to resign some royal castles that were in his possession. He therefore took the first opportu∣nity of Ralf's being at court, to demand immediate restitution of these fortresses; and upon the earl's desiring a little time to consult his friends upon the subject, he was charged with high treason and taken into custody. His adherents no sooner understood his situation, than they took to their arms, and attacked some places belonging to Stephen; but they were at last obliged to deliver the castles, as the ransom of Ralf, who was stripped of every thing but the county palatine of Chester. He was so incensed at the injury he had sustained, that notwithstand∣ing the oath which he was compelled to take to Stephen, before he obtained his release, he forthwith assembled his forces, and declaring war against the tyrant, surprized, attacked, and reduced a number of his castles, wasted the country about Lincoln, and blocked up the fort of Coventry, which was one of those he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1146.</NOTE> had been compelled to surrender. In this expedition he was joined by his nephew Gilbert, earl of Clare, whom Stephen had disobliged by detaining the castles which he had delivered as pledges for the restitution of those possessed by his uncle. These two noblemen employed the whole force and attention of Stephen, whom they worsted in several encounters, till at last they had the misfortune of being de∣feated, though not so depressed but that they still disabled him from making any advantage of Maud's leaving the kingdom; an event which might other∣wise have conduced to his re-establishment on the throne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

He was certainly a nobleman of great virtue, influence, and ability, who by his personal merit and importance, united a va∣riety of different interests in behalf of his sister, and kept them at a due dis∣tance from encroachment upon her authority and prerogative; whereas, he was no sooner removed, than many individual adherents followed their own inclina∣tions, built castles, oppressed the people, and breathed nothing but resentment and

<P>Her friends did not desist from action at her departure; because by this time Stephen had rendered himself odious to the whole nation, and the no∣bility knew how little they could depend upon his faith. Perhaps he might have profited by the absence of Maud, notwithstanding the enmity of those no∣blemen whom he had so outrageously injured, had not he involved himself in a quarrel with the archbishop of Canterbury, which had very unfavourable con∣sequences for his interest, and the kingdom in general. He and his brother Henry were exa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perated at pope Eugenius III. for having bestowed the legatine power upon Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, whom they detested; and the chapter of York perceiving that the animosity was equal on both sides, took this opportunity of complaining to his holiness, that William, the nephew of Stephen, had been intruded into their see by royal authority, without a cano∣nical election: that prelate was therefore deprived in the council held at Rheims, in Champaign. The pope having summoned Theobald of Canterbury, with the bishops of Worcester, Bath, Exeter, and Chichester, to attend at this council, Stephen, at the instigation of his brother, forbad the metropolitan to leave the kingdom, hoping, that if he should forbear to go thither, he would be suspend∣ed or deprived for contempt of the pope's order; and resolving, if he should leave England, notwithstanding the prohibition, to seize his revenues, and treat him as an outlaw. Theobald understanding that the ports were guarded to pre∣vent his voyage, embarked in an open boat, and arriving safely on the continent, proceeded to the council; and after it broke up returned to Canterbury, where he found his revenues sequestered by order of the king, who went thither and commanded him to depart the kingdom. During his exile this prelate, in let∣ters<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1148.</NOTE> which he wrote to several churches in England, threatened them with an interdict to commence at a certain day; and the monks of St. Augustine peti∣tioning the pope to prevent it, were ordered to obey the archbishop's commands. Theobald, arriving in Suffolk, was honourably received and protected by Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, and, at the appointed time, published the interdict against all the churches which acknowledged Stephen. Divine service immediate∣ly ceased in all the parts subjected to that king, while it was celebrated as usual in all those which obeyed the empress; a distinction that produced a very sen∣sible effect among the people. The monks of St. Augustine, who revolted against this ordinance, were excommunicated by the archbishop, and sent agents with a remonstrance to the pope, who would not admit them to an au∣dience, until they had undergone discipline and received absolution, which was granted to them in the name of the archbishop: then they were sharply rebuked for their misconduct, and ordered to obey Theobald, who was at the same time directed to punish them severely; an injunction with which he complied, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

Geoffrey Plantagenet's son Henry was now turned of six∣teen, and his father resolving to put him in possession of Normandy, sent him to Carlisle, in order to be knighted by David, king of Scotland. With a view to animate his mother's party, he landed in England with a great retinue of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The multitude of people, assembled on this occasion, alarmed the inhabitants of York, who communicated to Ste∣phen their apprehension that a scheme was formed against their city, and thi∣ther the king immediately marched with a body of forces: but no hostilities were committed on either side; for Stephen did not think proper to involve him∣self in a new war, if it could be avoided; and the confederates were not yet ripe for action.

<P>Eustace, the son of Stephen, being about the same time knighted by his father, now made his first essay in arms, and ravaged the lands of some noblemen attached to the empress; while the king extorted a large sum of mo∣ney from the people of the northern counties, and returned to the neighbour∣hood of London; from whence, by means of light excursions, he kept alive a praedatory war. He seemed to delight in besieging and surprising castles; and in some of these attempts he succeeded; but investing the castle of Worcester, belonging to his old friend the count de meulant, he met with such a vigorous resistance, that he was obliged to desist from the enterprize, and burned the town in revenge. During these transactions Henry sailing from Scotland to the continent, assumed the reins of government in Normandy, against the express command of Lewis, king of France, who, as sovereign of that fief, pretended to bestow it upon Eustace, his own brother-in-law. He therefore invaded the province and invested the castle of Arques; and Henry advanced to give him battle; but being dissuaded from fighting with his own sovereign lord, he drew off his troops, and undertook the siege of Tourne, by way of making a diver∣sion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry having taken possession of Anjou, Touraine, and Mayne, resumed his project upon England, and at the same time espoused Eleanor, queen of St. Lewis, whom her husband had repudiated after their return from the crusade, during which he was dissatisfied with her behaviour. Henry by this marriage annexed to his dominions almost all the provinces of France lying be∣tween the Loire and Pyrenees; and Lewis taking umbrage at his greatness, en∣gaged in an alliance against him, with king Stephen, Theobald, count de Blois, and Geoffrey of Anjou, who was for some reason become a professed enemy of his brother. Henry was just ready to embark at Harfleur for Eng∣land, with his uncle Reginald, earl of Cornwal, who had been sent to him with an invitation from the English nobility; when he received intimation, that Lewis, king of France, Eustace, the son of Stephen, and Robert, count de Perche, had invaded his Norman dominions, and invested Neumarché, while Geoffrey was employed in raising an insurrection in Anjou.

Stephen, incensed at their presumption, ordered them to be locked up in an apartment, and en∣deavoured to terrify them into compliance; but all his menaces proved ineffec∣tual. The archbishop found means to escape from the place of his confine∣ment, and, crossing the Thames in a boat, travelled with great expedition to Dover, where he embarked for France.

Robert, earl of Leicester, came to offer his service in person to Henry; Gundreda, countess of Norwich, put him in possession of her strong castle; Reading, and above thirty other fortresses, sub∣mitted without resistance. Then he besieged the fort which Stephen had raised to block up Wallingford, and took it by assault, before the king could march to its assistance. Not, but that he advanced with great expedition, and the two armies lay several days encamped within a quarter of a mile of each other. While they remained in this situation, a treaty was set on foot, by the interposition of William, earl of Arundel, and some other noblemen, and they parted without fighting, in hope that the articles would soon be settled. It was not without reluctance that Henry consented to this negociation, which he was afraid would be protracted to the detriment of his Norman dominions; and Eustace, son of Stephen, exerted all his endeavours to prevent an accommodation; but, lucki∣ly for the kingdom, death removed this worthless young prince, who died<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joan.

That Stephen should reign dur∣ing life, and justice be administered in his name; though nothing of consequence should be transacted without the advice and concurrence of Henry, who should succeed him on the throne, and in the mean time receive hostages for the deli∣very of the royal castles at his decease; and that Stephen's son William should inherit all the lands his father possessed in England and Normandy before he as∣cended the throne, together with the estate of William de Warenne, whose daughter he had married, and seven hundred pounds a year in the county of Norfolk, for which he should do homage, and give pledge for his fidelity to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's Foe∣dera.</NOTE> Henry.</P>

<P>This accommodation, to the observance of which an oath was taken by all the nobility and prelates, filled the whole kingdom with unutterable joy, and the two princes entered London together, with the utmost pomp and mag∣nificence: indeed it was a most happy event to the nation, which had been so long a prey to all the miseries of a civil war; nor was it less fortunate for Ste∣phen, who now found himself a king in reality. Henry having received the ho∣mage of the Londoners, as heir apparent to the throne, the king and he parted to spend the Christmas holidays in different places; but they soon met again at Oxford in a great council of the nation, when all the nobility and bishops took the oath of allegiance to Henry, with a reservation of obedience to Stephen<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Nevertheless Henry did not ex∣press any resentment, and the king and he set out together for Dover to receive Theodoret, earl of Flanders, and his dutchess, who had arrived in England. During their residence in this place, a conspiracy is said to have been formed against Henry's life, by the Flemings, who had settled in great numbers under the protection of William d'Ypres, earl of Kent; and Stephen's son William is supposed to have been the author of this infamous design. But, that prince's leg being fractured by a fall from his horse on Barham Downs, their measures<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on. Norm.

His voyage to Normandy was occasioned by an invasion of the king of France, who had entered his Norman dominions and taken Ver∣non; but being baffled in his attempt upon Vernueil, and seeing Henry, at the head of a strong army in the field, ready to oppose his progress, he thought proper to accept of peace, on condition of restoring Vernon and Neumarché, and receiving two thousand marks of silver to defray the expence of fortifying these two places. After this peace Henry gradually resumed the demesnes of his dut∣chy, which his father had alienated to engage the Norman barons in his interest; and these measures he pursued in such a manner, that the tranquillity of his do∣minions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

Stephen was a prince of great courage, fortitude, and activity; and might have reigned with the appro∣bation of his people, had not he been harrassed by the efforts of a powerful com∣petitor, which obliged him to take such measures for his safety, as were incon∣sistent with the dictates of honour, which indeed his ambition prompted him to forego in his first endeavours to ascend the throne. His necessities afterwards compelled him to infringe the charter of privileges he granted at his accession; and he was instigated by his jealousy and resentment to commit the most flagrant outrages against gratitude and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound policy. His vices as a king seem to have been the effect of the troubles in which he was involved; for, as a man, he was brave, open, and liberal, and, during the short calm that succeeded the tempests of his reign, he made a progress through the kingdom, published an edict to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

The people were too much fatigued with the calamities of the last reign to engage themselves in any faction that might rekindle civil dissension, and therefore their whole zeal was united in favour of Henry, who had already exhibited proofs of his valour and capacity. Six weeks elapsed since the death of Stephen before this young prince came over to take possession of the throne: but at length hav∣ing settled the affairs of his Norman dominions, and conferred with his mother touching the tenour of his conduct, he set sail from Harfleur in December, and next day landed at Hurst Castle, from whence he proceeded to Winchester, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>After having taken all these precautions to strengthen his own hands and reestablish the public tranquillity, he chose for his council, persons the most eminent for their wisdom, both of the clergy and laity: among others Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas Becket, archdeacon of the same church lately made high chamberlain, and Robert, earl of Leicester, high justiciary of the kingdom. At the head of his privy council was his mother Mathilda, who, though residing on the continent, directed all the deliberations of consequence from that sagacity which she obtained by long experience and vicissitude of for∣tune. By the advice of these counsellors, he convoked a general assembly or parliament, in which some regulations were made for the interest of the realm; the ancient customs and laws of Edward the Confessor, adopted by his grand∣father Henry I. were restored; and a charter granted under the great seal, con∣firming to the church, the barons, and vassals, all the customs, donations, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Another extraordinary council was summoned at Wallingford, where the members swore allegiance to Henry and his two sons William and Henry as eventual successors, though then in the state of infancy; and other laws were enacted for the benefit of the people. The kingdom immediately assumed a new face, agriculture and manufacture returned with security, and every individual seemed to enjoy the happy effects of the new government. Nevertheless Henry found it impracticable to rule so as to avoid the discontent of all his subjects. Several no∣blemen resented the proclamation for demolishing the castles, and among these the chief was William le Gross, earl of Albemarle, who had vast possessions in the north, where he had acted, during Stephen's reign, with sovereign power; he was already deprived of the title of York, which he had received from that prince, and perhaps his resentment partly influenced him in refusing to deliver up the castle of Scarborough, which he had rendered almost impregnable. But the king marching into Yorkshire, he at length submitted. Henry had another design in going northward, which was to punish William Peverel for having poisoned Ralf, earl of Chester. The murderer, conscious of his crime, and dreading the justice of the law, had already turned monk in the monastery of Linton; but, thinking himself unsafe in the protection of the habit, he fled from the country

at the approach of the king, who seized all his castles and estate, as the forfeiture of a felon. It was about this period that Henry, bishop of Winchester, quitting the kingdom without leave, Henry ordered all his castles to be levelled with the ground, though he could not secure the prelate's treasure, which he had found means<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Gerv. Mat. Paris.</NOTE> to convey to the continent, with the assistance of the abbot of Cluny. From the northern counties, Henry directed his march to the frontiers of Wales, where Hugh de Mortimer had fortified his castles of Bridgnorth, Clebery, and Wigmore; and prevailed upon Roger, earl of Hereford, to join him in his re∣volt, rather than part with his fortresses of Hereford and Gloucester. This no∣bleman, however, was reclaimed by the remonstrances of his kinsman, Gilbert Foliat, bishop of Hereford, who procured the king's pardon in his behalf; and Hugh, after having seen his three castles reduced by the royal forces, was fain to sue for mercy, which he obtained in consideration of giving up all the crown<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> demesnes that were in his possession.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch 1156.</NOTE> All opposition being now eradicated, and England enjoying the most profound tranquillity, Henry made a voyage to the continent, in order to quell a new insurrection which his brother Geoffrey had raised in Anjou. This revolt was altogether as unsuccessful as the first; for the king reduced and retained his castles, though in lieu of these he gave him lands in the open country, assisted him in keeping possession of Nantes, the people of which had chosen him for their sove∣reign, and allowed him a very considerable annuity, in consequence of his sub∣mission. The king having quieted this disturbance, and received homage from the nobility of Guienne, he returned to England, and raised a great army, in order to make a conquest of Wales, and marched into F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>intshire against Owen Guy∣nath, prince of North Wales, who lay incamped at Besingwerk. When he under∣stood the English were advancing through a wood called Coel Eulo, he suddenly attacked their van with such fury, that several officers of distinction were slain, and the whole division would have been cut in pieces had not the king come sea∣sonably to their succour: the disorder among the English was in a great measure owing to the cowardice of the earl of Essex, who threw away the standard, and fled with great precipitation, crying aloud the king was slain. An instance of misconduct for which he was afterwards accused of high treason by Simon de<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowel's Hift. of Wale<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Montfort, who proving him guilty by vanquishing him in single combat, he was shorn a monk, and confined to the monastery of Reading. Henry, find∣ing how dangerous it was to march precipitately through unknown woods and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

By this method he continued his march without further disturbance to Snowdun, where Guynath and his barons finding themselves unable to oppose his progress, sued for peace, swore fealty, delivered hostages, and restored all the castles and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

In this expedition he was visited at Chester, by Malcolm, king of Scotland, who did him homage for the county of Huntingdon, and perhaps upon compulsion next year at Carlisle for his whole kingdom; inasmuch as the Scot quitted him in disgust, without<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>On his arrival in his foreign dominions, he had a conference with Lewis VII. of France on the river Epte, which separated their territories, and there agreed upon a match between young Henry and Margaret daughter of Lewis, both infants. Thence Henry accompanied the French king to Paris; and the young princess being delivered into his hands, he committed the care of her education to Robert de Newbourg, justiciary of Normandy. Such was the mutual confi∣dence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE> that reigned between the two princes on this occasion, that Henry was created grand seneschal of France; a title of which he availed himself in his de∣signs upon the county of Nantes, which he claimed as heir to his brother Geoffrey. He was the more able to undertake an enterprize of this kind, as he possessed all the territories that surrounded Brittany, and acted as guardian to the young count of Flanders left under his tuition by count Thierry, when he departed on his expedition to Jerusalem. Conan, count of Brittany, had taken possession of Nantes on the death of Geoffrey, who had no title to the country, but the sub∣mission and choice of the inhabitants, after they had relinquished their allegiance to their natural sovereign. Conan, notwithstanding his title, which was un∣questionable, submitted to Henry upon being summoned to surrender the inheri∣tance of Geoffrey; because he foresaw that opposition or non-compliance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould bring upon him the resentment of a powerful king, and infallibly deprive him of the earldom of Richmond, which he possessed in England, of more value than the country in dispute; he therefore ceded it to Henry, whose next care was to settle all differences subsisting between him and the princes contiguous to Normandy; yet before he quitted Brittany he agreed with Conan upon a match between that prince's daughter Constance and his son Geoffrey, who was now in the cradle: a marriage in consequence of which Geoffrey became duke of Bretagne upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>Henry, not yet satisfied with this addition of Nantes, the extensive do∣minions he formerly possessed, and the prospect of his son's succeeding to Brittany, resolved to revive his queen's pretensions to the county of Tholouse, in right of her grandfather William, count of Poitiers, who married Philippa, heiress of William IV. count of Tholouse. These dominions had been alienated to Ray∣mond de St. Gilles, the younger brother of William, for a certain consideration, and the count of Poitiers afterwards confirmed the sale for a sum of money; but Lewis the young when he married Eleanor sole daughter and heiress of William IX. count of Poitiers, pretended that the first alienation to Raymond de St. Gilles, was no other than a collusion between him and his brother; and that the con∣firmation was an imposition upon the simplicity of the count de Poitiers: he therefore alledged that the whole transaction was null and void; and that Eleanor ought to enjoy the inheritance of her grandmother Philippa, upon restoring the sum which the count of Poitiers had received for the confirmation of the pre∣tended sale. Raymond V. then count of Tholouse, in vain pleaded prescription, which was a weak plea against the power of the French king, who threatened to make his pretensions good by force of arms. Nevertheless, after a long negotia∣tion, the difference was terminated by the marriage of count Raymond with Con∣stance, the sister of Lewis, and widow of Eustace, the son of king Stephen. In

<P>But now that she was married to Henry, the same rights devolved to that ambitious prince, who accordingly claimed the country; and Raymond plead∣ing the sale and prescription, he resolved to reduce it by the power of his sword.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> To defray the expences of this important enterprize, he raised a very considerable sum of money, by taxing every noble fief in Normandy and his other foreign domi∣nions; he allowed his tenants to commute their personal service in the expedition for a certain pecuniary consideration, known by the name of Scutage; and this amounted to a large collection with which he enlisted a strong body of mercenary soldiers. Leaving commissaries to levy these volunteers during the winter, he came over to England, and passed the Easter holidays at Worcester, where he and his queen approaching the offertory, laid their crowns upon the high altar, vowing they would never wear them again; so that an end was put to the solemn coronations on great festivals, which had hitherto taken place. Henry's design, in coming to England at this juncture, was to raise from his English subjects such a scutage as he had established abroad; and this being levied he hasted over to Guienne, ac∣companied by Malcolm, king of Scotland, whom he knighted on this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> St. Thom.</NOTE> William, count of Boulogne, and a great number of English nobility, who wanted to signalize their courage, and served as volunteers at their own expence.</P>

<P>He was joined on the continent by the troops of William, lord of Montpelier, and Trincavel, viscount of Bezieres and Nismes. Raymond Be∣renger, count of Barcelona, sent him a reinforcement in consequence of a treaty by which Richard, the king's second son, was affianced to the count's daughter; and stipulating that this young couple should be put in possession of Guienne as soon as they should be of age to consummate the marriage. Thus prepared, Henry attacked Cahors, the capital of Quercy, which he soon compelled to sur∣render; then invading the county of Tholouse, he reduced a great number of places; so that the capital was almost wholly blocked up, when the king of France, the count's brother-in-law, marched to his succour with a small body of troops, and threw himself into the city. Henry was not a little astonished at this act of hostility from a prince with whom he had lately contracted an alliance and intimacy of friendship: and as it was deemed in those days a breach of honour and duty in a vassal to fight against his sovereign, he would not assault a place de∣fended by the king of France in person, notwithstanding the advice of chancel∣lor Becket <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitzstep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens, in his life of Becket, says that prelate had seven hundred knigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that besides these he maintained at his table, for forty days<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twelve hundred horsemen, each of whom received of him three shillings a day to provide for his horses and squires; and that the number of all his dependants amounted to four thousand men able to carry arms.</NOTE>, who importuned him to take Lewis prisoner; an exploit which he might have easily atchieved before the rest of the French army could advance.</P>

<P>Influenced by this punctilio, he left a body of troops, to maintain the footing he had in that country, under the command of the count of Barcelona, and the viscount of Bezieres, and took the route to Normandy, which had been inva∣ded by Robert, count de Dreux, and Henry, bishop of Beauvais, brother to Lewis, who detached them upon that expedition to divert the king from the siege of Tholouse. Henry, having refreshed the troops after their long march,

fell into the Beauvoisis, took and destroyed the strong fortress of Gerberoy, and reduced several towns and villages to ashes. Simon de Montfort, count of Evreux, surrendered his castles to Henry, and they were secured with strong garrisons, which made excursions to the neighbourhood of Paris, ravaging the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>When this accommodation was ratified, prince Henry, now in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Lewis, incensed at this ab∣rupt manner of proceeding, persuaded Theobald, count of Blois, whose sister Adela he had lately married, to fortify Chaumont for the convenience of making incursions into Tourraine: but Henry marching thither, reduced the fortress, and committed it to the care of Hugh d'Amboise. At the same time, he put a strong garrison into Fretteval and Amboise, secured the castles of the count d' Evreux, and gave orders for repairing all the fortifications on the frontiers of his territories towards France; while he himself retired to Mans, where he proposed to spend the winter. The next campaign was opened by Lewis, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dicet.

To oppose these incursions Henry took the field; and, in the course of their motions, the armies were more than once in sight of each other; but neither of the kings caring to hazard a battle, they agreed to a cessation of arms, during which some overtures were made for a peace, and these terminated in a temporary accommodation: Gisors, Neafle, Neufchatel, and the other places allotted to Margaret as her dowry, being committed by way of sequestration to the hands of Totes de St. Omer and Ro∣bert<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The correspondence being renewed between the two kings, they com∣municated their sentiments to each other on the subject of the schism, which had happened at the death of pope Adrian; and agreed to acknowledge Alexander III. as his lawful successor.

<P>A perfect reconciliation being effected between those two princes, Henry with his queen repaired to Barfleur, where they took shipping in the begin∣ning of the year, and arrived in England, which they found in great tranquillity.

As for the Welch they had made inroads upon the English, during Henry's absence, and surprised the earl of Gloucester and his countess, at the castle of Cardiff; so that Henry was incensed against him, and they were obliged to surrender some castles, and give hostages of the first quality, in order to ap∣pease<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Henry had hitherto reigned without the least disturbance or opposi∣tion; but now he involved himself in a dispute with Becket, who had lately succeeded to the archbishopric of Canterbury; and this contest was productive of infinite anxi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty to the kingdom, and even interrupted all the measures of his administration. Thomas Becket was the son of a burgher in London, educated in the schools of that city, though he afterwards studied some time at Paris, and, on his return, became clerk or accomptant in the sheriff's office. He was recommended by archdeacon Baldwin, as an understanding young man, to Theo∣bald, archbishop of Canterbury, who took him into his family, and bestowed upon him the benefices of St. Mary le Strand, Otteford, in Kent, with a pre∣bend in London, and another in Lincoln. Thus provided, he set out for Bo∣logna, where he studied the canon and civil law, which last was, at that time, in great request all over Europe; and finished his studies at Auxerre, in Bur∣gundy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit S. Tho</NOTE> Being so well qualified to transact business in the court of Rome, he was sent thither by Theobald on several negociations, which he managed with
<PB N="309" REF="3180"/>
such ability and success, that his patron ordained him deacon of York; and he was elected archdeacon of Canterbury immediately before the death of Ste∣phen. At the accession of Henry to the throne, he was, by Theobald's recom∣mendation, appointed chancellor; a post of the greatest profit, power, and dignity in the realm: at the same time he had a vast number of ecclesiastical preferments; was created constable of the Tower, to which place was annexed all the knights service, with the honour of Eye, and the castle of Berchamstede, including near three hundred knights. His revenues were immense. His expence incredible. He kept open table for persons of all ranks. The most costly dainties were purchased for his entertainment. His houses were adorned with the richest furniture. His apartments glittered with gold and silver plate; the very bridles of his horses were of silver, and nothing could exceed his equipage in mag∣nificence. He retained a prodigious number of knights in his service; and the nobility sent their children to be educated as pages in his family: Prince Hen∣ry was committed to his care and tuition; and the king went frequently to see the pomp of his entertainments. He employed two and fifty clerks in keeping the accounts of vacant prelacies, and his own ecclesiastical preferments; and every day he received presents of horses, vestments, plate, or money. When he crossed the sea, he was always attended by five ships; and in his embassy to Paris, concerning the marriage of the princess Margaret, he appeared with a thousand persons in his retinue, displaying such wealth and grandeur, as amaz∣ed the spectators. He diverted himself in hawking, hunting, chess-playing, and tilting, at which he was so expert, that, while he served in Normandy, he un∣horsed a French nobleman of approved valour, and carried off his courser in triumph. Thus, Thomas lived as chancellor Becket, but when, contrary to the advice of Maud the empress, he was promoted to the archbishopric of Can∣terbury, his whole conduct took a new turn; his disposition seemed to undergo a total change: he now practised all the severities of church discipline, and at his consecration appeared to imbibe that spirit of turbulence and presumption, which descended like an inheritance in the succession of that primacy.</P>

<P>Thomas being, by the king's command, elected archbishop of Canterbury, ordered the day of the consecration to be kept as the folemn festi∣val of the Holy Trinity, contrary to the practice of all other nations, who ce∣lebrate this feast according to the proper computation; and he sent the seals to Henry, who had not yet left his foreign dominions. The king took umbrage at this insolent resignation, implying a refusal to give him any farther assistance in the affairs of state; and when that prelate went to court at his return, Hen∣ry received him with a remarkable coldness of civility. This misunderstanding was increased by Becket's conduct when he returned from the council of Tours, where pope Alexander had received him with extraordinary honours, and granted all the privileges he desired. Here a canon was enacted against the usurpation of ecclesiastical estates by the laity; and, in consequence of this arti∣cle, he, at his arrival in England, demanded of the king the castle of Rochester, and the manors of Saltwode and Hethe, as belonging to the church of Canter∣bury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<PB N="310" REF="3190"/>
Tunbridge, in the possession of Roger, earl of Clare, great-grandson to Richard Fitz-Gilbert, to whom it had been granted by William the Conqueror, for a valuable consideration of lands to an equal extent in Normandy. This grant had been confirmed by the archbishops of Canterbury; but Becket pretending that his predecessors had no power to alienate the property of the church, sum∣moned Roger to do him homage. This claim equally alarmed and disobliged the nobility, and the king had great reason to take umbrage at his proceedings; when he bestowed the church of Eynesford, in Kent, upon a creature of his own, afferting, that it was the prerogative of the archbishop, to fill all vacant<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Coll.</NOTE> churches in the manors of his military tenants, as well as of the monks of Can∣terbury. The agents of Laurence, to whom he had given the church of Ey∣nesford, being expelled by William, lord of the manor, who possessed the ad∣vowson, Becket immediately excommunicated the expulsor, though he held of the crown, and was entitled to the benefit of an act passed in the reign of the Conqueror, importing, that no military tenant of the crown should be excom∣municated without the knowledge of the king. This presumption was an addi∣tional cause of disgust to Henry, who, in a letter to the archbishop, desired William might be absolved, and received a flat refusal. After some altercation, however, he at length complied, with a very ill grace, rather than incur the pe∣nalties of a law, the breach of which amounted to high treason. These were the preludes to an open rupture between the king and archbishop.</P>

<P>During the preceding reign, a great number of idle and illiterate persons had, in order to enjoy the protection of the church, received holy orders, by the indulgence of the bishops, who ordained all that presented themselves; and as these, having no benefices, belonged to no diocese, consequently were sub∣ject to no jurisdiction, they committed the most flagrant enormities with impu∣nity. Though the canons condemned pluralities, one clergyman frequently pos∣sessed seven churches and prebends, bestowed by the indulgence of prelates, who had also introduced the practice of commuting for penance; so that the most scandalous crimes were excused for money, and all ecclesiastical discipline neg∣lected. Before the death of Theobald, the king had complained of these disor∣ders to the bishops, who paid no regard to his remonstrance; because they had laid it down as a maxim to give no satisfaction to the crown touching the irre∣gularities of the clergy. Thus exempted from punishment, the offenders open∣ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">G Newberg. i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p ft. S.

<P>A gentleman of Worcestershire being murdered by a clerk, who had de∣bauched his daughter, the king insisted upon the assassin's being tried in the secular court; but Becket would not allow him to be tried by the civil jurisdiction; and committed him to the bishop's prison. Another who had stolen a silver chalice out of a church in London, was demanded by the king, and denied by the arch∣bishop, who nevertheless punished the delinquent severely, because his crime af∣fected the church, and was deemed unpardonable sacrilege. Yet even on this occasion he encroached upon the civil power, by ordering the priest to be branded in the face with an hot iron; whereas the ecclesiastical court had no right to in∣flict corporal punishment: so that it was a flagrant invasion of the royal autho∣rity, and such a dangerous precedent as not only incensed the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but alarmed the whole nation. Henry's friends suggested, that if Becket should proceed in

<P>The king did not require much stimulation to put a stop to this tyranny and injustice, which was so enormous, that, in a very short space of time, above an hundred persons had been murdered by ecclesiastical ruffians, who were screened from the penalties of the law. He therefore assembled the bishops at Westminster, where after having enumerated the disorders arising from the corruption of the spiritual court, in which the penalties of every crime were commuted for money; and expatiated upon the barbarous murders, which had been so frequently com∣mitted by clerical assassins, he desired that one of his judges should assist at the trial of every infamous offender before the archdeacons; and that every murderer should be degraded from the priesthood, and delivered over to the secular arm. Becket retired with the prelates to deliberate upon this proposal, which appeared highly reasonable to his brethren, who exhorted him to comply with the king's desire; but he entrenched himself behind the papal decrees and canons: affirm∣ing, that it was contrary to the law of God, and the institutions of the church, for a delinquent to undergo a double judgment for one offence; that they were forbid to be concerned in sentences of blood; and therefore he would never con∣sent to expose any criminal ecclesiastic to capital punishment. Henry being ap∣prized of their obstinacy, demanded if they would observe the customs of the crown, and the laws of the kingdom; and the archbishop answered in the name of the rest, that they would obey them in all points that did not interfere with the rights of their order. Henry, dissatisfied with this evasive answer, insisted upon their engaging simply, without qualification and reserve, to obey the laws of the realm; and they persisting in their refusal, he went away in the evening, fired with indignation. Though Becket had resigned the office of chancellor, as inconsistent with his sacerdotal function, he still retained the honours and castles with which he had been intrusted while he filled that station; and now that the king plainly perceived his intention was to raise the ecclesiastical power on the ruins of the royal authority, he deemed it highly imprudent to leave those places of strength in the hands of such an ambitious prelate, to whose vio∣lence of temper and affected popularity he was no stranger: he therefore de∣manded the restitution of the castles; and, they being surrendered, quitted Lon∣don without taking the least notice of the assembly. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>The bishops, alarmed at his abrupt departure, pressed the metropoli∣tan to appease the king by complying with his desire: but he resisted all their importunities, until he was assailed by Robert de Melun, his own domestic chaplain, and Philip, abbot of Eleemosina, who was sent over by the pope in quality of legate a latere, to compromise the differences between the king and the archbishop. These prelates represented to him the danger which might ac∣crue to the church from the resentment of Henry, in such strong colours, at the same time urging the desire of the pope, who had exhorted him to pacific measures, that he was at lengt' prevailed upon to visit Henry at Wodestoke, where he promised, upon the faith of an honest man, to observe the laws and customs of the kingdom, without prevarication. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>That this compliance, with that of the other bishops, might be au∣thenticated in the most solemn manner, Henry issued writs for assembling the prelates and nobility at Clarendon. But, in the interim, Becket altered his re∣solution,
<PB N="312" REF="3210"/>

Moved by such insinuations he came into the royal presence, and engaged upon oath to observe the laws of the kingdom, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

<P>These constitutions restraining the papal authority in England, and limiting the ecclesiastical jurisdiction within proper bounds, were extremely dis∣agreeable to the pope, who, out of the sixteen, condemned ten, as repugnant to the canons of the church. The archbishop himself had no sooner made his re∣treat from Clarendon, than he repented of having given his assent to such un∣priestly articles. He exclaimed against them as dangerous encroachments upon the church's prerogative; concerted measures with the bishops for opposing the execu∣tion of them; and prescribed for himself a quarentine of penance, during which he abstained from the altar, until he had sol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icited and obtained ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olution from his holiness.

<P>By this time the difference between the king and Becket had pro∣ceeded almost to extremity, and the archbishop, dreading a legal prosecution for opposing the laws of the land, resolved to quit the kingdom, and actually em∣barked at Rumney; but, after having made two unsuccessful efforts, was driven back by a contrary wind. Mean while the king, apprehensive of his escaping to the continent, immediately commenced a suit against him, on an appeal of a nobleman called John Mareschal, who had sued in the arch∣bishop's court, for an estate at Mundeham, belonging to the see of Canterbu∣ry; and being, as he apprehended, unjustly cast, evoked the cause by a writ of appeal into the king's court. The archbishop was summoned to appear, but
<PB N="314" REF="3230"/>
instead of coming in person he sent four of his knights with a letter of excuse, pretending sickness; and a certificate from the sheriff, specifying the defects in John's title and appeal. His excuse was rejected as meer pretence; his messen∣gers were taken into custody, for offering falshoods to the court; and orders sent to the sheriff to make out a writ for summoning him to appear before the great council at Northampton. There he was tried, and found guilty of a contempt of the royal authority and a breach of allegiance, in refusing to appear upon the appeal of John Mareschal; and though he insisted upon the candour of his own proceedings, and the injustice of the appellant, who, he alledged, had made oath upon a hymn book, instead of the evangelists, he was adjudged to have forfeited all his goods and chattels; and the sentence, after some debate, was pronounced by the bishop of Winchester.

<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>Besides this conviction, the king exhibited another charge against him, for having embezzled three hundred pounds he had received of the ho∣nours of Eye and Berckhamstede. In answer to which impeachment, he alledged that he had laid out a greater sum in the repairs of the royal castles; and wanted to wave the prosecution, because he was not cited to the council on that account: but, the king denying his first allegation, and demanding immediate judgment, he agreed to refund the money, and gave security for the payment. Next day an∣other suit was commenced against him at the instance of the king, for the sum of one thousand marks, which he had borrowed of his majesty; and he was at the same time required to give an account of the revenues of the archbishopric, and all the sees and abbeys which had fallen vacant, and been managed by him while he filled the post of chancellor. He observed, as before, that as he had not been summoned on this account, he did not come prepared for such a reckoning; but that he would give satisfaction on that subject at a proper time and place. This answer was not deemed satisfactory; and the king insisted upon his finding se∣curity to refund the sums he should be found guilty of having appropriated to his own use. As he was accused of having embezzled two hundred and thirty thousand marks, he could find no-body in court that would undertake for the payment; but, in order to gain time, he desired leave to consult his suffragans and clergy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>This request being granted, he assembled the prelates at his own house, and consulting them upon the emergency of his affairs, was advised by the bishop of Winchester to make a composition with the king for a large sum of money, with which he would supply him for the purpose. Two thousand marks were offered and refused: then their consultation being renewed, the more moderate bishops proposed that he should resign his archbishopric, and implore the king's mercy; but others exhorted him to shield himself with the ecclesiastical privi∣leges, and plead that his being elected archbishop of Canterbury, discharged him from all civil actions he might have incurred before his elevation, and all the debts he had contracted as chancellor. This strange plea he adopted, as the most flattering and conformable to his own violent and haughty disposition: but the consultation was opened again next day, which being Sunday he did not stir abroad; and on Monday he complained of the cholic, by which he was
<PB N="315" REF="3240"/>
hindered from appearing in court. This being the case, Henry sent all the earls to visit him, and he promised to make his defence on the morrow in a judicial manner. He had by this time resolved to plead his ecclesiastical privilege, because indeed it was not in his power to account for the treasure he had em∣bezzled; and with a view to interest the people in his behalf, he attempted to fascinate their eyes and judgments with the trompery of pomp and ostentation. He in the morning celebrated the divine service appointed for the festival of St. Stephen the martyr, beginning with "Princes sat and spake against me." He officiated in his pall, to render the ceremony more striking, and proposed to walk barefoot to court in his pontificals, carrying the cross of Canterbury, as if the church had been threatened with a persecution: but, being diverted from this extravagant design by the remonstrances of the clergy, he laid aside his pall and mitre; and mounting a-horseback in his vestments, proceeded to the king's court, with the cross carried before him. Alighting at the castle-court, he took the cross in his own hand, and advanced into the king's chamber, where he sat down, holding up the sacred implement as a banner, to the amazement of all the spectators, and the unutterable shame of the bishops, one of whom told him that he seemed to come prepared to set the whole nation in a flame.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The king, who sat in an inner room, ordered by proclamation the prelates and nobility to attend him, and complained loudly of Becket's in∣tolerable insolence in entering his court in such a presumptuous manner, as if he came to bid him defiance. The whole council joined in condemning this in∣stance of his pride as an unpardonable insult upon his majesty: the prelates gave the king to understand, that Becket had in the morning reproached them with having concurred in the sentence by which his goods and chattels were forfeited; that he had appealed to the pope against the sentence; and inhibited them, by virtue of the papal authority, from sitting in judgment upon him for the future, in any part of his conduct previous to his primacy. The king was extremely provoked at this appeal in a civil cause, which struck at the very basis of his regal authority; and ordered his barons to enquire of the arch∣bishop himself, whether or not he had actually made an appeal so contrary to the oath of fealty he had taken at Clarendon. Becket replied, that a sacerdotal oath always implied a reservation of obedience to God, his own ecclesiastical dig∣nity, and the episcopal honour of his person; that, as he had been dismissed freely from his secular charge, and promoted to the see of Canterbury, he was not obliged to give account of any previous transaction; that he had no security to offer; that he had laid an inhibition on the bishops for his own safety; and that he had appealed and did again appeal to the pope, putting his own person and the church of Canterbury under the protection of his holiness. The king, being made acquainted with this insolent answer, conjured the bishops by their homage and fealty to deliberate with the barons upon the sentence that should be pronounced against such a contumacious offender; but, they begged leave to acquiesce in the inhibition, as they knew the violence of Becket, and saw him prepared with his cross to denounce against them the sentence of suspension or excommunication. Henry, in consequence of the dangerous predicament in which they stood, consented to their sitting and deliberating apart from the ba∣rons; and when they had maturely considered the case, they sent a message to the archbishop, complaining of his having laid them under the necessity of con∣travening
<PB N="316" REF="3250"/>
the constitutions of Clarendon; by one of which they were expresly bound to fit in judgment with the king's barons: they reminded him of his having been the first who swore to those constitutions; and appealed to the pope for the redress of the grievance to which he had subjected them by his unjust prohibition, which, nevertheless, they would for the present ob∣serve. He told them in answer, he would plead against their appeal at the court of Rome; that neither he nor they were bound by the constitutions of Clarendon, because their o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th implied a salvo for their ecclesiastical dignities; and those constitutions had been condemned by the pope, whose example they ought implicitly to follow.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while the king ordered the earls and barons, assisted by some high sheriffs of counties, to give judgment against Thomas Becket, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, who was declared guilty of perjury and treason. Then the earl of Leicester, one of the justiciaries of the kingdom, advancing to Bec∣ket, at the head of the earls and barons, told him, it was the king's pleasure that he should either come before his majesty's court, and acquit himself of the crimes laid to his charge, or submit to his sentence, which he was ready to pro∣nounce. The archbishop starting up, said, when he was promoted to the see of Canterbury, he conceived himself freed from all engagements to the court; and therefore would not answer to any charge that related to his former conduct: that he being their father, they ought not to judge their parent, nor would he hear their sentence; inasmuch as he had disowned all courts of judicature but that of the pope, to whom he appealed, and under whose protection he would now retire. So saying, he walked with his cross to the door, which was imme∣diately opened at his desire, but in passing through the castle-yard, he was hooted along as a perjured wretch and a traitor, and retorted these reproaches with great virulence upon some persons of distinction, whom he branded with the epithets of liars and secundrels. He called earl Hammelin, the king's natural-brother, an impudent bastard, and reminded another nobleman of his kinsman's being hanged for felony.</P>

Thus protected he rode unmolested to the convent of St. Andrew, from whence he sent three bishops to ask a license and safe-conduct for his departure; but, Henry deferring his answer till next day, he was afraid of being arrested, and retired privately in the night, attend∣ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit S.

<PB N="317" REF="3260"/>
and three of his own chaplains, to accuse Thomas before the pope, and sollicit his deposition; at the same time he wrote letters to Lewis, king of France, and Philip, count of Flanders, expatiating upon Becket's insolence and treason, and desiring they would not countenance the fugitive, or allow him to reside within their dominions. But these remonstrances had no effect; for Philip received him with great hospitality; and as Lewis hated Henry ever since his perfidious prac∣tices with the knights templars, whom he had persuaded to betray their trust, he took this opportunity to shew his disrespect, in visiting the archbishop at Soissons, and assuring him of his protection. Nor did Henry's embassy succeed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. S.

These deputies were on the road home∣wards, when they descried about three hundred horse attending Becket to Sens, which he entered in triumph, surrounded by the cardinals who went forth to meet him on horseback: the inhabitants of the place received him with loud acclama∣tions, and the pope, rising up at his approach, embraced him with marks of the warmest affection.</P>

<P>The report of this reception was very disagreeable to Henry, who perceiving how little satisfaction he should receive from the pope, resolved to do himself justice; and with the advice of his nobility assembled at Marlborough, ordered the revenues of the see of Canterbury to be sequestered, together with all the churches, rents, and chattels of the clergy that adhered to the archbishop; a proclamation was issued for banishing all the kinsmen and domestics of Becket, and his relations, being summoned to his palace at Lambeth, were compelled to promise upon oath, that they would leave the kingdom with the first fair wind, and repair immediately to the place of the archbishop's residence, that he might be mortified at the sight of his friends in distress, and exhaust his wealth in their maintenance: an illiberal and inhuman act of tyranny and re∣venge, which luckily failed of producing the desired effect; for all of them were absolved of their oath by the pope, and provided for in different churches and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>Becket acquired such favour and influence with the pope, that he ventured to tell him in confidence, he had not been canonically elected, but in∣truded into the see by the regal authority; he therefore made a formal resignation to his holiness, who in consideration of his extraordinary merit and sufferings on account of his attachment to the papal power, restored him to his archbishopric, and till such time as he could recover possession, recommended him to the abbot of Pontigny, where he was entertained at the expence of the monastery: but, he had scarce taken up his residence in this retreat, when reflecting that almost all his pre∣decessors had been monks, he was seized with the desire of taking the habit, and wrote on this subject to the pope, from whom he received it, hallowed by the pa∣pal benediction. Alexander, to crown all these favours, annulled the sentence by which Becket's goods and chattels were forfeited, pretending that an inferior could not judge a superior, especially such a prelate as the archbishop, who had

As Alexander was invited to return to Italy, the king imagined he should be able in an interview with that pontiff to efface the bad impressions he had received of his character from Becket; and he repaired to Normandy for this purpose: but<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>The king, perceiving the ascendancy which Becket had gained over Alexander, resolved to prepare for the worst consequence that could result from such influence, and before he quitted Normandy, enacted three several constitutions to be observed in all his dominions in England as well as upon the continent, pro∣viding among other regulations that no appeals should be made to the pope or archbishop, on pain of imprisonment; that the lands belonging to the adherents of Alexander and Becket, should be confiscated; that the clergy who resided abroad, tho' in possession of livings or estates in England, should be summoned to return within three months, and in case of disobedience forfeit their benefices; that if any person should bring into England letters of interdict from the pope or archbishop, he should be punished as a traitor, with the loss of eyes and castration, if a secular clergyman; by the amputation of the feet, if a regular; by hanging, if a laic; by burning, if a leper; that all bishops, abbots, ecclesiastics, or laymen, obeying such interdict, should with all their kindred be immediately expelled the realm; that all the ports of England should be strictly guarded, and no person be allowed ingress or egress, without licence from the king or chief justi∣ciary; and that Peter-pence, tho' carefully collected, should not be issued from the exchequer, without a particular order from the king. The bishops of London and Norwich having published in their dioceses, an interdict laid on the lands of Hugh Bigot, earl of Norfolk, and a sentence of excommunication, which the pope had fulminated against that nobleman, the king ordered them to be prose∣cuted for contempt of the statutes of Clarendon, which were sent to all the justices in England, that all the nobility and people of the kingdom might swear to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

Being summoned to appear before the council, and give an account of their faith, they seemed equally ignorant and obstinate; and refusing to engage in any dispute for the defence of their tenets, for which however they professed themselves ready to suffer martyrdom, they were de∣clared heretics, and delivered over to the secular arm. The king ordered them to be scourged and branded with a red hot iron, and by a proclamation forbad all persons to admit them into their houses, or supply them with the necessaries of life; so that every individual of those poor fanatics perished by cold and famine. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duet.

<P>Henry could not be too cautious in taking steps to anticipate the resentment of Becket, whose violence of temper was hardly restrained from the most rancorous measures of revenge by the authority of Alexander, who dreaded that if matters should be brought to extremity against the king or king∣dom of England, Henry would join his new ally the emperor of Germany, who patronized Guy de Crema the antipope; and he was not yet so firmly established in the papal chair, as to set such a conjunction at defiance. Influenced by these considerations, he strongly recommended temperance to the archbishop, who was not without great difficulty and address witheld from proceeding to the ex∣tremity of church censure. He raised a terrible clamour in all places by his let∣ters
<PB N="320" REF="3290"/>
and emissaries, asserting that his cause was the cause of God; and that Christ was judged in his person before a lay tribunal, and crucified again in his s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferings. He wrote insolent letters to the king himself, affirming that he derived all his power from the church; that priests were exempted from human laws; and that the secular being subject to the ecclesiastical power, Henry ought to part with the ancient customs and regalities of his crown. He obtained a grant of the primacy of all England from the pope, who writ in his favour to the English bishops, ordering them to procure a restitution of all the benefices belonging to Becket's clergy, on pain of excommunication, without benefit of appeal. Alexan∣der's affairs were no sooner in a prosperous condition, than he allowed the arch∣bishop to follow the most extravagant dictates of his resentment. Accordingly that surious prelate repaired to Soissons, watched all night at the shrine of St. Drausius, a ceremony which was supposed to render the probationer invincible; and thence hied him to Vezelai, resolved to thunder out a sentence of excommuni∣cation against the king of England and his ministers. Hearing, however, that Henry was dangerously ill, he contented himself with sending a letter to that monarch, threatening him with the censures of the church, if he would not im∣mediately repent and make reparation to the clergy whom he had injured; at the same time he denounced excommunication against the ministers by name; all that were concerned in sequestring the revenues of the see of Canterbury; that obeyed, favoured, or executed the constitutions of Charendon, which he annulled; and he absolved all the prelates and barons from the oath they had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>This censure, ratified by the pope, was very little regarded, be∣cause Becket's character was so universally known; but Henry was so incensed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1167.</NOTE> at his presumption, that he wrote to the chapter of Cistertians, at Pontigny, threatening to seize all their estates throughout his dominions, if they should continue to maintain Becket in their abbey; so that he was obliged to quit the convent, and returning to Sens, was hospitably received by the king of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</NOTE> from whom he received an honourable allowance in the monastery of St. Colombe. Notwithstanding the pains that were taken to guard the ports of England, the bishop of London, while he was at the high altar celebrating the festival of St. Paul, received from an unknown hand a packet, containing authentic copies of Becket's letters, and a bull of legation granted to him by the pope, which he ordered the bishop to notify to all the prelates of the realm, with injunctions to re-establish all his clergy in their benefices, within two months, on pain of excommunication, without benefit of appeal. This mandate, confirmed by the pope's authority, laid the bishop under great difficulties, because by refusing to execute the order, he should incur the censure of disobedience: but he was soon rid of his fears by the success of John de Oxford and the other agents, who had been sent to make the pope acquainted with the appeal of the Eng∣lish bishops and clergy, and beg the protection of his holiness. They had per∣fuaded Alexander that it would be very practicable to effect an accommodation between the king and the archbishop; and he was so pleased with the argu∣ments they used on the subject, that he suspended all the effects of Becket's cen∣fures, and sent two cardinals with legatine powers into Normandy, to labour at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist.

<P>During these transactions a war broke out between Henry and Lewis king of France, whose minds had been irritated to a mutual animosity by the affair of Becket; and now the king of England falling upon the territories be∣longing to the count d'Auvergne, who had rejected his arbitration in a dispute with his own nephew, the king of France espoused his cause, and invaded the Vexin Normand. Henry, marching to the defence of that country, opened a conference on the subject of a treaty with Lewis; but, the French nobility being averse to an accommodation, the war was renewed with great fury on both sides, until the two monarchs, unwilling to subject their dominions to such cruel ravages, agreed to a truce, during which the king of England marched into Brittany, and reduced Guiomar, viscount of Leon, who had re∣volted. While he remained in this country he received the tidings of his mo∣ther's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Gerv.</NOTE> death. That princess had, in the latter part of her life, acquired a great character for prudence, charity, and devotion. She was convinced of her son's equitable intentions in his dispute with the archbishop; she justified his zeal for the customs and prerogatives of the crown; but she disapproved of the written constitutions, which she imagined might have been omitted without any preju∣dice to the regal authority.</P>

<P>These her sentiments, in all probability, induced the pope and Becket to sollicit her mediation, which she had promised to employ; but this being an∣ticipated by her death, the dispute was left to the address of William de Pavia, and Otho, the two legates a latere, sent by the pope with full power to negoci∣ate an accommodation. At least when they departed from Rome, they were in∣vested with such power; but, in consequence of Becket's complaints, importing that they were attached to the king, and that he would not adhere to their deci∣sion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After a tedious journey they arrived at Caen in Normandy, where they found the king, with a good number of his prelates, in full hope of seeing the dispute terminated by a sentence that would confirm the constitutions of Cla∣rendon: but Henry was not a little chagrined, when they gave him to under∣stand that the archbishop was exempted from their decision. Nevertheless, as the pope had in a letter exhorted Becket to make hearty advances towards a peace, the legates met him at Planches, between Gisors and Trie, where they assured him of the king's pacific disposition, advised him to make his submission, and desired to know upon what terms he was willing to treat: they proposed, that in order to re-establish the peace of the church, he should resign his see, pro∣vided the king would give up the constitutions: but he rejected the expedient, renounced their arbitration, and declared he would enter into no treaty of accom∣modation, until he and his clergy should be restored. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitz Stephens Vit.

<P>The legates, despairing of success, returned to give an account of their negociation to the king, and the term of the appeal made by the bishops being almost expired, they took this opportunity of renewing it, and received appellatories from the cardinals, who signified to Becket at the same time, that he should not pass any censure upon the king, prelates, or realm of England, without the pope's express direction.

<P>The legates were equally unsuccessful in executing the other part of their commission, which related to a peace between the crowns of France and England, which in order to promote they set out for Paris, where their pro∣posal met with insurmountable difficulties. The barons of Poitou and Guienne, being disgusted at Henry, who had invaded some of their privileges, listened to the suggestions of Lewis, who inflamed their discontent, and encouraged them to revolt with promise of assistance. A good number of them having engaged in a private treaty with that monarch, and even given hostages that they would not lay down their arms without his consent, broke out in open rebellion and ravaged the country; though the truce between the two crowns was not yet ex∣pired. Henry, putting himself at the head of his forces, marched against the rebels, took their castles, destroyed their towns, and reduced them to such a low condition, that nothing hindered their submission, but their engagement to the king of France. In order to remove this obstacle, Henry having garrisoned the castles, and committed the government of the country to his queen and Patrick<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1168.</NOTE> D'Evereux, earl of Salisbury, went to hold a conference with Lewis between Mante and Pacey, in hope of establishing a peace, or at least of renewing the truce, which was well nigh expired. At this congress he loudly complained of the French king's having debauched his subjects, and insisted upon his re∣storing the hostages of the Poitivins: but, Lewis peremptorily refused to comply with this demand, and all that he could obtain was a further cessation from hostilities. In the mean time the barons of Poitou had again revolted, and slain the earl of Salisbury in a treacherous manner; and Henry had just begun his march towards that country, with a view to take vengeance on Guy de Lusignan and the other accomplices in that murder, when he was obliged to suspend his indignation, and turn his arms against the barons of Brittany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

Eudo, viscount of Porhoet, a nobleman of an ambitious and turbulent disposition, who claimed the government of the whole province, had been expelled by Hen∣ry, and took refuge in the French court, where he was encouraged to form a conspiracy against the government of the king of England. He accordingly prevailed upon several lords of Brittany to engage in the design. A treaty was con∣cluded with France, and hostages were given, as in the case of Poitou; so that a universal rebellion ensued. Henry no sooner received information of this revolt, than he entered Brittany with his forces, took and demolished Eudo's fortresses, reduced and ravaged all the country of Porhoet, Dinan, and St. Malo; pro∣ceeding with great rapidity of conquest, until he was obliged to give the king of France a meeting at La Ferte Bernard, where he hoped to renew the truce, if a solid peace could not be effected. But, as the French knew the nobility of Le Maine were ripe for an insurrection, to which they had been instigated by the Bretons, this interview proved ineffectual, and the war was renewed.</P>

<P>Henry finding himself exposed to the efforts of so many enemies, re∣solved to gain over one of the most troublesome, namely, Matthew, count of Boulogne, who having claimed the county of Mortagne, and met with a refusal, had, in the course of the preceding year, equipped an armament of six hun∣dred vessels, for an invasion of England; though he was baffled in his attempt by the vigilance and conduct of Richard de Luce, chief justiciary and guardian of the realm. This difference Henry thought proper to compromise, by allow∣ing him a very considerable pension, in consequence of which he engaged to reinforce the king with a body of auxiliary knights. Being denied a passage by land through the territories of John, count of Ponthieu, he was obliged to transport his troops by sea; and Henry, resenting the refusal, entered John's do∣minions, ravaged the country, and reduced above forty towns to ashes. Mean while the king of France making a sudden incursion into Normandy, retorted these devastations; but, as Henry advanced against him, he retired, though not so speedily but that the king of England fell upon his rear, and took a good number of prisoners. The war was carried on in slight incursions and skir∣mishes; for though the two kings commanded their respective armies in person, and were equally famed for courage and military skill, they industriously avoid∣ed a general engagement. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist.

<P>The emperor and princes of Germany offered to make a diversion in favour of Henry, by invading France with a powerful army; but, as they ex∣pected he would declare for the antipope Paschal, in consideration of these suc∣cours; he chose to confide in his own strength, rather than run the risque of embroiling his dominions still farther, by incurring the resentment of Alexander, with whom he still kept measures, and from whom he had obtained a dispen∣sation for the marriage of his son Geoffrey with Constance, heiress of Bretagne. Though the emperor and Henry differed in opinion or politics with regard to the pope, that difference did not retard the celebration of the marriage between his daughter Maud and the duke of Saxony. Queen Eleanor repaired to England, in order to make preparations for the departure of that princess, who was sent into Germany with a prodigious sum, levied for her portion by a general tax,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Gerv.</NOTE> and a fine exacted from the Jews permitted to reside in the kingdom. The earnest sollicitations of Lewis, and the importunities of Becket, at length prevail∣ed upon pope Alexander to allow this rancorous prelate to denounce his censures against the king and realm of England; and a day was appointed for excommuni∣cating Henry, and laying the nation under an interdict, if, in the mean time, the king should refuse to restore the archbishop and his clergy. Becket, accord∣ing to this bull of permission, when the time arrived, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against some of the king's ministers, notwithstanding the se∣cond appeal, and without form of law or citations; and Ralf, archdeacon of Landaff, was sent to Rome to procure absolution for the persons thus cen∣sured. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit.

<P>About this period two nuncios from the pope arrived at Danfront in Normandy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where they presented letters from his holiness to the king, pressing him to restore Becket, and referring him to the bearers for a further explanation of his desires. Henry, having conferred with these representatives, assembled his pre∣lates at Bayeux, where he declared that out of regard to the pope, he would be reconciled to Becket and his clergy; but, in return for this condescension, he
<PB N="324" REF="3330"/>
expected that the nuncios would absolve his ministers that were then present, and even cross the sea to give absolution to those that remained in England. Af∣ter some dispute they were prevailed upon to comply, on condition that the re∣conciliation should take place within a certain limited time; and in this agree∣ment, which was committed to writing, the king inserted a salvo for the dignity of his kingdom. The archbishop's partizans took exceptions to this clause, and the nuncios desired it might be expunged, otherwise they retracted their promise. Routrou, archbishop of Rouen, proposed, that another should be substituted in its place, importing, that Becket should be restored to his see, and the clergy retrieve their benefices in as full a manner, as that in which they had enjoyed them before their privation; and Henry agreed to this amendment, provided his salvo should remain. Becket's friends insisted upon its being removed, and the nuncio's finding both parties inflexible, departed without having succeeded in their negociation. The prelates wrote to the pope in favour of the clause, in de∣fence of which the king sent Reginald de Salisbury and Richard Barre to the court of Rome, with orders to demand that the pope would absolve those whom Becket had excommunicated, and prevent such censures for the future, otherwise he should be obliged to provide for his own honour and security in an∣oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Mean while supposing that the instances of the French court were the chief obstacles that retarded an accommodation with Alexander, he exerted all his endeavours to subdue the revolted barons, from whose insurrection Lewis hoped to derive great advantages, and their confederacy being altogether dis∣solved by Henry's activity, and the departure of Guy de Lusignan for Jerusa∣lem, of which he was created monarch, the king of France became more tractable, and in a conference at Montmirail, the two monarchs adjusted all their diffe∣rences. Henry had by this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime made over Normandy, Le Maine, and Anjou, to his eldest son Henry; Poitou and Guienne, to his son Richard; and Bre∣tagne, to Geoffrey; who held it as a fief depending upon Normandy, and swore fealty to his elder brother. Lewis, as sovereign of all these fiefs, confirmed this disposition, and young Henry did homage to his father-in-law, and his young son Philip Augustus, for Anjou, Maine, and Bretagne, having taken the oaths for Normandy on a former occasion. Richard, contracted to Adelais, another princess of France, did homage for Guienne; Henry himself was restored to the office of high<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steward, which had been hereditary in the counts of Anjou; and on Candlemas-day served the king of France at table in that capacity. As the king of England was not restrained by any article of this treaty, from chastising the revolted barons of Poitou and Guienne, he marched into those counties, destroyed their castles, and reduced to obedience the counts of Ango<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesme and La Marche, together with all the lesser nobility of those pro∣vinces. Then returning to Normandy, he built the strong fortress of Beauvoir en lions: drew broad and deep trenches on the frontiers of his Norman domi∣nions, to prevent the depredations of his neighbours; erected fisheries in the ri∣ver Mayenne; and ordered high banks to be raised along the north-side of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> Loire, to keep that river within its channel.</P>

<P>When the treaty was ratified at Montmirail, Lewis endeavoured to mediate a peace between Henry and Becket, and several conferences were held upon the subject, in which the archbishop, being on the spot, was prevailed
<PB N="325" REF="3340"/>
upon to avoid mentioning the constitutions of Clarendon, as they were already condemned by the pope. The prelates had well nigh persuaded him to throw himself at the king's feet, and refer the terms of reconciliation to his royal plea∣sure; but when he was introduced for this purpose, he clogged his submission with his old salvo of the honour of God and the liberty of the church; and Henry was so incensed at this reservation, that he told him he would allow of no such evasive subterfuge. Then turning to the king of France, he inveighed severly against his pride, arrogance, and ambition; and to vindicate himself from the aspersions which the other had thrown upon his character, offered, in the hearing of all the spectators, to restore him to the see of Canterbury, which he should possess with all the privilege and authority, that was ever vested in the greatest prelate that ever enjoyed that archbishopric, provided he would pro∣mise to pay to Henry such regard as the most powerful prelate had at any<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1169.</NOTE> time paid to the most insignificant monarch of England. The king of France, together with his prelates and nobility, could not help applauding the can∣dour of this proposal, which they exhorted Becket to embrace. But he refused to part with a tittle of his salvo; and several French noblemen made no scruple of condemning his pride publicly, and exclaiming, that since he rejected such reasonable terms, he deserved no protection, and ought not to be suffered to live within the dominions either of England or of France. The two kings parted at night, without taking the least notice of the archbishop; and Lewis for some days neglected to visit or supply him with provisions: but this seems to have been a dissembled disgust; for he soon readmitted him into his former place of friendship and familiarity. Henry sent the bishop of Seez and Geoffrey Ridel to expostulate with the French king, upon his countenancing a man who had rejected such reasonable propositions; when Lewis replied, that as the king of England seemed so much attached to the customs of his ancestors, so would he adhere to that right of hospitality, which he inherited with his crown.</P>

<P>Becket, presuming upon the friendship and support of that monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit. S.

While the nuncios were in Normandy, he had consented to their suspending the excommunication of Geoffrey Ridel, Nigelde Sackeville, and others of the king's ministers, on con∣dition that the peace should be completed before the time fixed for their depar∣ture. Gratian set out for Italy; and he being entirely in the archbishop's inte∣rest, made such a representation to the pope, that this pontif, being moreover irritated at the king's menacing letter, wrote to Becket, that if he and his clergy should not be restored before the beginning of Lent, he might exercise his le∣gatine powers without restriction. Becket did not fail to make use of this li∣cence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. S.

He like∣wise issued an interdict upon the province of Canterbury, to take place with the other sentence, in case the king should not make him ample satisfaction before Candlemas; and the bishops of London and Salisbury were comprehended in this censure.</P>

<P>The bishop of London expecting some such sentence, had lodged an ap∣peal before it was issued; but finding it denounced notwithstanding that pre∣caution, he summoned his clergy to join him in a new appeal, and the arch∣bishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

At the same time the king wrote a letter to Alexander, desiring him to annual those rash irregular sentences; and he defrayed the expence of the bishop's journey to Italy, whither he forthwith bent his way, in order to justify his appeal. When he endeavoured to pass through Burgundy, in which Becket had many zealous partizans, whom he attached to his interest during his residence at Pontigny, the roads were beset by those adherents, who resolved to intercept the bishop; so that he was obliged to change his route, and travel through Provence, and over the Alps, to Milan, where he received a letter from the pope, containing an order for Routrou, archbishop of Rouen, to give him absolution. He therefore re∣turned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> S Tho.</NOTE> to Normandy, and was absolved on the festival of Easter.</P>

<DIV4 N="51" TYPE="section">

<P>Alexander acted the more moderately on this occasion, as he perceived the interdict had produced very little effect in England, and the sentences of ex∣communication were utterly disregarded: he knew Henry to be a prince of great authority and resolution, beloved by his subjects, and tenacious of his preroga∣tive; and he began to fear that should matters come to extremity, the see of Rome might lose all the power and influence she had acquired in England. He, on these considerations, made fresh efforts towards a reconciliation of the king with the archbishop, and employed the bishop of Bellay and the prior of the Carthusians to persuade Henry to a restitution; but all their endeavours prov∣ing ineffectual, he sent a commission to Simeon, prior of Montdieu, and Ber∣nard de Corilo, of the order of Grandmont, to labour at an accommodation; and they were furnished with two letters to the king, to be used occasionally. In the first, his holiness exhorted him to restore the archbishop, and in hope of that restoration, suspended the censures of Becket, whom he likewise inhibited for the present, from denouncing any new sentences against Henry or his subjects: and the other, to be delivered in case the first should produce no effect, contained menaces of allowing Becket to exert all his ecclesiastical power without restriction.</P>

<P>The conferences were opened again at Montmirail, in presence of the king of France, attended by his lords and prelates, who seconded the delegates in persuading Becket to humble himself before Henry, and sue for a reconcilia∣tion. He accordingly made a kind of submission, though qualified with the old exceptions; but Henry still insisting upon his absolute promise to observe the old customs, he refused to comply, and the negociation was interrupted. Both sides persisted in the same resolution at the second meeting, when the pope's comminatory letter was delivered to Henry, who said he would consult the bishops of England upon the subject, but fixed no day for an answer; so that all prospect of accommodation disappeared. As pope Alexander had ex∣acted a promise of Becket, that he never would incur any new obligations, when he absolved him of his oath to observe the constitutions of Clarendon, and as he offered at this last conference to swear to the observance of the antient customs, with the same saving clause that was allowed in the oath of sealty taken by prelates at a coronation, the audience in general disapproved of Henry's inflexibility, and the archbishop of Rheims, with several French prelates, ad∣vised<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p S.

<P>The king, perceiving that his conduct had turned to his prejudice, sent agents to Rome to sollicit a further respite from ecclesiastical censure, until other measures could be taken for the pacification; and the pope granted his request: but Henry, being uncertain of their success, sent orders in the mean time to England, to inforce the regulations which had been lately made to pre∣vent the bad effects of an interdict. He prescribed a certain day, before which all the English clergy abroad should return, and after that term made it crimi∣nal to appeal to the pope or the archbishop, or to obey any of their man∣dates: he decreed, that if after this term any person should be found bring∣ing into England letter, mandate, or interdict, from either Alexander or Beo∣ket, he should be punished as a traitor to the king and kingdom. But if, not∣withstanding this precaution, an interdict should be conveyed into the realm, all persons observing it should be banished, with their kindred, and forfeit their estates: and the sheriffs of counties were directed to exact by themselves and their deputies, an oath from all the subjects in the kingdom, above the age of fifteen, that they would observe these regulations.</P>

<P>By this time Henry was heartily tired of the dispute, and resolved to recal the archbishop, without insisting upon his oath or promise to conform with the customs which had produced such anxiety to both; for he imagined he should be better able to deal with that haughty priest in his own kingdom, than while he enjoyed the immediate protection of foreign potentates. In these sentiments he pretended to make a kind of pilgrimage to St. Denis, hoping he should find an opportunity to broach his proposal in an interview with the king of France, at Montmartre, in the neighbourhood of Paris. According to his expectation, in conversing with that prince and his prelates, the discourse turning upon the liberties of the church, as not at all incompatible with the royal au∣thority, the bishops interceded for the restoration of Becket, to which Henry ex∣pressed no aversion. That this favourable disposition might not be lost, they prevailed upon the archbishop, who was in an adjoining apartment, to prefer a petition, specifying all his demands, touching the restoration of himself and his clergy; and as some disputes arose, touching the vacant benefices which had been filled in his absence, the king offered to present him with a thousand marks to defray the expence of his return, and submit the cause to the determination of the French peers, the Gallican church, or the university of Paris. Lewis and all the nobility, French as well as English applauded the proposal; and Becket consented to wave his other demands, provided the king would grant security for the performance of the agreement. When they expostulated with him upon the indecency of requiring security from his lord and sovereign; he said, he would be satisfied with a kiss of peace: with which, however, the king refused to indulge him, alledging he had sworn in his wrath, that he would never kiss the archbishop, even though a reconciliation should be effected.</P>

He did not fail, however, to dispatch John of Oxford, dean of Salisbury, and the archbishops of Rouen and Seez, on an embassy to the pope, with an account of what had passed at the conference, and an assurance of his readiness to restore the archbishop; nay, in order to remove the only remaining objection, he proposed, that his eldest son should, in his stead, give the kiss of peace, which Becket so eagerly desired; Alexander approved of the expedient, and, in order to take the advantage of this happy disposition in Henry, he forthwith sent a commission, empowering Routrou, archbishop of Rouen, and Bernard, bishop of Nevers, to execute the treaty. They were instructed to admonish Henry to grant the kiss of peace to Becket, as the pope absolved him of the rash oath he had made; but, should he still decline that condescension, they were directed to persuade the archbishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar. Ch. 1170.</NOTE> to accept the kiss of his son Henry; the peace was not to be retarded, even though the king should delay the payment of the thousand marks; but, if within forty days after they should have communicated their commission, and the pope's monitory letter to his majesty, he should retract his promise he had made, they were directed to lay an interdict, without appeal, on all his foreign<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron Ger.</NOTE> dominions.</P>

<P>Mean while the king assembled the states of Bretagne at Nantes, where they swore fealty to him and his son Geoffrey; and, having settled the affairs of Normandy, set sail for England, in which he arrived, though not be∣fore he had been well nigh shipwrecked in a violent storm. During his absence of four years, the sheriffs of counties had continued in office, and the attention of the people being wholly engrossed by the ecclesiastical dispute, their conduct had not been inspected; consequently the revenue was embezzled and the sub∣jects oppressed. To redress these grievances, Henry convoked a great council at Windsor, in which the kingdom was divided into circuits, and commissioners were appointed to make a progress through these divisions, and take security from all sheriffs, their bailifis, and other officers, that they would appear at an appointed day before the king, and give an account of their management. They were likewise impowered to examine into all frauds, extortions, and misde∣meanors of those sheriffs and their officers, who, in those days, were employed to levy the most considerable branches of the revenue: they accordingly appear∣ed, and, having undergone the inquisition, were for the most part turned out of their offices.</P>

<P>The day on which these delinquents were punished, was distinguished by another great solemnity.

He came over from Normandy for this pur∣pose, and was crowned in the church of Westminster-abbey, in the midst of a more numerous assembly than had ever appeared on the like occasion. After the ceremony the Scottish king and his brother did homage to the young king, and all present swore fealty to him, saving that which was due to their lord the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cti a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nas.</NOTE> king his father. Roger, archbishop of York, who was likewise legate for Scot∣land, officiated in crowning this young prince, who was of a proud insolent disposi∣tion, of which he could not help exhibiting marks at the banquet that succeeded the solemnity. The king served the first dish with his own hands, saying to his

Young Henry, instead of making a proper reply to this compli∣ment, turned towards the archbishop of York, and, in a low voice, observed, that there was nothing strange in seeing a great king's heir served by the son of a petty count.</P>

<P>The king seems to have been very careful in keeping his design secret, till the very day of execution; as if he had been apprehensive of some opposition; for the nobility and prelates imagined they were assembled for no other purpose, than that of trying the sheriffs; and the young prince was igno∣rant of his father's intention, until he arrived in England, two days before the coronation. Not but that a general report prevailed, of the king's having formed such a scheme, though it was not supposed he had fixed any time for the execution of it: Becket had writ to the archbishop of York, and the other English prelates, forbidding them to assist at the coronation, and the pope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at his desire, had confirmed the inhibition. Some of these mandates were actually brought over into England; but such was the severity of the law, that no person would deliver them according to the direction. Becket, understand∣ing they had miscarried, sent an order to the convent of Christ-church, to issue out, by virtue of the papal authority, the like inhibition upon all the suffra∣grans of the church of Canterbury; to enter a protest in favour of its rights, and make an appeal for prevention of the intended injury: but this order was utterly disregarded. Then Becket sent his own inhibitions, confirmed by the pope, to Roger, bishop of Worcester, at that time residing in Normandy, who undertook to deliver them, and had reached Dieppe in his way to England, when the queen and Richard du Hommet, justiciary of the Norman dominions, suspecting his design, on account of his attachment to Becket, sent an order for∣bidding him to embark, and laid an embargo upon all the shipping in the har∣bour. The archbishop, baffled in all his schemes, had recourse to the king of France, who resolved to send a caveat to queen Eleanor, against the corona∣tion of prince Henry, unless his daughter should be crowned at the same time; otherwise he would immediately declare war against England. But this project could not be executed in time to prevent the ceremony. Becket was extreme∣ly mortified, when he found it impracticable to hinder this coronation, which he hoped would never take place until the prince should first swear, that he would maintain the liberties of the see of Canterbury, and reverse the constitu∣tioons of Clarendon; and, in the first transports of his wrath, he wrote a letter to pope Alexander, affirming, that the young king had not only omitted the usual oath for preserving the liberties of the church; but even swore that he would maintain the constitions of Clarendon. The pope was so incensed at this represen∣tation, that he forthwith supplied Becket with sentences of suspension and excom∣munication against all the English prelates who had assisted at the solemnity: but the pope was undeceived by Gilles, bishop of Evreux, who attended at the coro∣nation, and attested that Henry had taken an oath in favour of the church; and that the constitutions were not once mentioned on the occasion. The letters of sus∣pension were qualified accordingly, and though granted against the archbishop of York, and the bishops of London and Salisbury, never took effect in England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ep.

prince had no sooner settled the affairs of his kingdom, than he crossed the sea, and in a conference at La Ferté in the Pais Chartrain, compromised his dif∣ference with the king of France, who had expressed great resentment, and even denounced war against him for the affront put upon his daughter, in omitting her coronation when her husband received the crown. The king of England made proper satisfaction for this supposed insult; and while the princes were employed in estab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishing a solid peace between the two crowns, the legates visited B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cket at Sens, and prevailed upon him to wave the kiss, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estitution of the mean profits of his see, and accompany them to the conference. The ceremo∣nial of the interview being regulated, Lewis absented himself, that Henry's ge∣nerosity might appear more free and unconstrained; though count Theobald and the greatest part of the French nobility were present at this extraordinary reconciliation. When Becket approached, the king advanced to meet him in the most gracious manner; and notwithstanding the ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our and violence with which that prelate had persecuted him so long, he, to the amazement of all the spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta∣tors, talked to the archbishop with great ease, familiarity, and seeming kindness, as if they had never been at variance. After the first salutation, they conferred with the archbishop of Sens apart, and then retiring by themselves, passed the greatest part of the day in private discourse. All material points being adjust∣ed, Becket attended Henry on horseback, and, as they rode together, pro∣posed, that the king should make satisfaction to the church of Canterbury, whose right had been invaded by the archbishop of York, who had officiated at young Henry's coronation. Though his majesty was of opinion that he had a right to chuse the prelate who should perform that ceremony, yet, in order to manifest h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s inclination for peace, he promised that the see of Canter∣bury should have satisfaction: nay, as the queen of young Henry was not yet crowned, he assured the archbishop he should perform that ceremony, at which he might likewise place the crown on her husband's head, as a right inherent in the see of Canterbury. Becket, transported at this instance of the king's con∣descension, alighted instantly, and threw himself at the feet of his sovereign, who, leaping from his horse at the same time, lifted him from the ground, and helped him to remount. He, at the same time, extended his royal grace to the clergy who had attended Becket in his exile; but, when the bishop of Lisieux proposed that the archbishop should likewise forgive those who adhered to the king, he evad∣ed the request by fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>volous distinctions, which might have produced mischievous consequences, had not Henry, to avoid the revival of animosity, put an end to the conference, and invited the archbishop to accompany him directly to Nor∣mandy, where he would make suitable provision for him and his retinue. This invitation he declined, pretending it would be indecent to part so abruptly with the king of France, and his other benefactors; though the real reason was a re∣solution he had taken to wait in France, until he should be certified that his agent<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S.

But at length his constitution triumphed over his disease; and when his health was re-established, he went on a pilgrimage to
<PB N="331" REF="3400"/>
St. Mary of Roque-Madour in Quercy. As this indisposition occasioned a delay in signing the powers necessary for Becket's agents, that prelate, dreading the sincerity of the king, sollicited the pope to denounce his ecclesiastical censures; and Alexander issued his bulls accordingly, reviving the former sentences of excommunication and interdict against the kingdom of England, as well as Henry's foreign dominions, to take place if full satisfaction should not be given to the archbishop within thirty days after the commonition. The king, in order to avert these troublesome censures, proposed another meeting with Becket at Amboise, where every remaining obstacle was removed by the mediation of the French king; and the archbishop agreed to receive the kiss of peace from young Henry. His agents were immediately impowered to take possession of the arch∣bishopric; and his clergy were restored to their benefices: but, as six dioceses were vacant, the king resolved to supply them with prelates well affected to his person and government before the return of Becket, who had formed a scheme to fill those vacancies with his own creatures. In order to prevent such a dan∣gerous accession of power, in a priest of his character, Henry ordered the bi∣shops of York, London, and Sarum, to repair into Normandy, with six deputies from each chapter of the vacant sees, that proper persons might be chosen for such important offices. Geoffrey Ridel, archdeacon of Canterbury, whom Becket looked upon as h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s bitterest enemy, was promoted to the see of Ely, though he died before his consecration; Reginald, son of the bishop of Salis∣bury, was elected in the diocese of Bath; and the other vacancies were filled with prelates who had no great devotion to the archbishop.</P>

<P>Another quarrel was kindled between France and England, by Hen∣ry's purchasing of Henry de Vienne, Montmerail, and the castle of St. Agnan in Berry, which was an appanage of the dutchy of Guienne. This step gave great umbrage to Theobald, count de Blois, who had a claim to those places; and the king of France supported his pretensions at the head of an army, with which he invaded Auvergne. Henry had advanced with a body of troops to take<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. de Monte.</NOTE> possession of Bourges; but finding himself anticipated by the French forces, agreed to a truce with Lewis. While he was employed in this expedition, Bec∣ket arrived at Rouen, where he found John of Oxford, dean of Salisbury, ap∣pointed to attend him into England. Embarking at Witsand with a favourable wind, he arrived at Sandwich, where, in consequence of the king's order, he was exempted from examination, by Gervase de Cornhill, high sheriff of Kent; and Reginald de Warenne, who, in quality of itinerant justiciaries, guarded that port, with a number of armed officers. They treated the archbishop and his clergy with great respect, to which Becket was not intitled by his behaviour; for, upon hearing that the king intended to fill the vacancies, he had dispatched a person before him with letters to the archbishop of York, and the prelates of London and Sarum, to notify the suspension of the first, and the excommunica∣tion of the other two; censures under which they remained a whole year, though in the mean time, they pursued their voyage to Normandy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist.

<P>Nothing could exceed the insolence with which this ambitious arch∣bishop conducted himself from his first landing: instead of retiring quietly to his diocese, with that modesty which became a man just pardoned by the king for crimes of the deepest dye, he promulgated his legatine powers; treated the king's officers with contempt and indignity, and, on pretence of a visitation,

made a progress through Kent, in all the splendour and magnificence of a so∣vereign pontiff, while the towns, through which he passed, welcomed him with solemn processions and hymns of thanksgiving. He had brought over three fine horses, as a present to the young king, who re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided at Wodestoke, for which place he set out in full assurance of a gracious reception. But that prince being informed of this ridiculous parade, calculated to dazzle the eyes of the vulgar, after he had broken the conditions of his reconciliation, violated the laws, and insulted the royal authority from the first hour of his arrival, sent Jocelin de Lovain, brother to the second queen of Henry I. and ancestor of the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy fa∣mily, to defire he would immediately return to his diocese. Becket had, by this time, advanced as far as Southwark, attended by all the knights that held of his see, and a great number of armed followers, to support his legatine authority, which he exercised in suspending or depriving the clergy, and excommunicating the laity who had adhered to the laws of the kingdom in opposition to the papal decrees. He did not think proper to dispute the young king's order, which, however, he did not scruple to say he should have disobeyed, had it not been for the near approach of Christmas, which he desired to celebrate at his own church in Canterbury: nevertheless, he would not return directly, but in order to ma∣nifest his contempt of the royal authority, went to his manor of Harrow in Mid∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sex, where he sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d several days.

<P>Advice of these proceedings being brought to Henry, during the festival of the nativity, which he kept at Bures near Bayeux, with his prelates and barons, he was so provoked at the unparallelled arrogance of Becket, that he could not help breaking forth into acrimonious expressions against that turbu∣lent prelate, whom he had raised from the dunghill, to be the plague of his life and the continual disturber of his government. He is said to have declared he should never enjoy a quiet hour while Becket should be alive, and lamented that he had no friends about him, otherwise he should not have been so long exposed to the insults of a babbling priest. Whether he actually used this expression in the first transport of his wrath, or his sentiments were misinterpreted by his do∣mestics, certain it is, four barons or knights of the houshold, namely William de Tracey, Reginald Fitzu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, Hugh de Moreville, and Richard Brito, engaged in a mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th to revenge the king's quarrel, withdrew from court, took ship∣ing at different ports, and met next day at the castle of Saltwode, within six miles of Canterbury. Mean while the king suspecting their design, by the privacy of their departure, dispatched messengers to overtake, and forbid them, in his name, to commit any violence; but the conspirators had already taken shipping, and the king's orders arrived too late in England, to prevent the execution of their design. Henry, having taken this precaution, summoned a council to de∣liberate upon measures for restraining the furious conduct of the archbishop, whom some of the assembly advised him to prosecute and put to death as a tray∣tor; but this proposal he rejected, though it was resolved to take Becket into

custody. William de Magneville, earl of Essex, Saier de Quincy, and Richard du Hommet, were cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged with this commission; and the last of these noble∣men crossing the sea to England, sent deputies to Winchester, with an account of this resolution to the young king, who was desired to send privately from court a body of knights to arrest the archbishop, while he should keep watch on the sea coast to prevent his escape. All these steps, however, were rendered unnecessary by the dispatch of the four barons, who being joined by twelve other knights at the castle of Saltwode, belonging to Ralf de Broke, they proceeded sorthwith to Canterbury. The assistants were intended to keep the citizens quiet, while the barons, entering the palace, secured the great gates, and seized two or three of the knights belonging to the family; these they committed to the charge of their followers; then they advanced to Becket's apartment, and expostulated warmly with him about the rashness and insolence of his conduct. He asserted, that the spiritualities of his see were derived from the pope; that he held nothing of the king but the temporalities; and upbraided three of them with their ingratitude to him who had retained them in his service while he enjoyed the post of chancellor. These reproaches provoked them to such a de∣gree, that they resolved to deprive him of his life, and retired to put on their armour. During this interval he might have escaped, but he either presumed too much on his sacred character, or aspired to the glory of martyrdom. Not∣withstanding the intreaties of the monks, who apprehended mischief, he deter∣mined to assist at vespers, and passed through the cloister of the convent into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vit. Pref.

<P>The circumstances of the murder, which were extremely barbarous, the place in which it was perpetrated, and the fortitude with which he resigned himself to his fate, conspired to inhance his character in the opinion of the vul∣gar, who now lamented him as a saint, whom they had before detested as a trai∣tor. The doors of the church being left open by the assassins, the people rushed in to see the body, and dipping their fingers in his blood, crossed their foreheads with great devotion, believing themselves sanctified by the blood of a holy martyr. The monks had laid it upon the high altar; but hearing that the murderers intended to return and throw it into some indecent and unhallowed place, they buried it privately in a stone coffin, near the spot on which he suf∣fered; but it was afterwards, by order of pope Honorius II. taken up with great solemnity, and deposited in a sumptuo <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shrine, at the expence of arch∣bishop Langton. As for the perpetrators of the fact they retired to the castle of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, belonging to Hugh de Moreville, where they remained a whole year secluded from all society; but, tired at last of solitude, and commanded by the king to submit to the pope's judgment, they went to Rome, and were ordered to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

He received the advice of this unlucky affair at Argentan, and, foreseeing all the mischie∣vous consequences of it, could not help breaking forth into a most bitter lamen∣tation: nay, so much was he affected with the news, that he shut himself up three days in his chamber, and refused all manner of sustenance and comfort. At length his nobility and prelates were with difficulty admitted, and representing the necessity of taking some steps to prevent the mischiefs that might redound from this melancholy event, he appointed ambassadors to vindicate his character at the court of Rome. They departed immediately, and, after a very dangerous and fatiguing journey, arrived at Frascati, where they found two of Becket's adherents sol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting against the king; and the pope so incensed, that it was with the utmost difficulty they could obtain an audience. Maunday Thursday being the festival on which the pope denounces ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esiastical censures, the ambassadors were afraid, that he would excommunicate the king by name, and could find no other expedient to avert the sentence, than that of swearing before a full con∣sistory, that the king would stand to the pope's judgment. Thus appeased, Alex∣ander contented himself with fulminating the sentence against the actors, aiders, abettors, advisers, and approvers of Becket's death, and all that harboured or re∣ceived the murderers: but the bishops of the embassy, with all their intreaties and remonstrances, could not prevent his confirming the interdict, which had been laid upon his Norman dominions. All the benefit they reaped from their negociation, was a suspension from further proceedings, until the pope should send two legates into Normandy to examine into the particulars of Becket's death, and take cognizance of the king's humiliat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on: even this was purchased at the expence of forty thousand marks of silver, and five thousand of gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brady.</NOTE> which Henry was fain to defray, rather than incur the resentment of the pope, at a juncture, when his subjects were on the point of renouncing their allegiance.

<P>He was now indeed obliged to exert all his policy and address in avoiding a war with his neighbours on the continent, and in protracting the mission of the legates, until the novelty and horror of Becket's death should gradually diminish and decay. He thought it would be necessary to divert the attention of his people from this melancholy subject, by engaging in some spe∣cious enterprize that would captivate their fancy, and enhance his own reputa∣tion. He foresaw that nothing could answer these purposes more effectually than a conquest of Ireland; a design which he had formed in the beginning of his reign, and towards the execution of which he had obtained a grant of that island from pope Adrian IV. under pretence of propagating the gospel, and cor∣recting the vices of the inhabitants. He now resolved to embark in this expe∣dition, which appeared the more easy, as several private adventurers had already made great progress in that country. The original pretext for this war, was that the Irish had taken some natives of England, and sold them for slaves: but the motives that induced Adrian, who was himself an Englishman, to in∣dulge Henry with the brief, was, exclusive of a national partiality, the pros∣spect of adding to the power and revenues of the Roman see; for it was expresly stipulated, that he should establish the tribute of Peter-pence over all the island.</P>

<DIV4 N="67" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The conquest of Ireland was facilitated by its own intestine divi∣sions. The inhabitants lived in septs or clans under different chieftains; and a number of these owned the sovereignty of a superior, who extended his autho∣rity over a large district. The country was antiently divided into five such kingdoms; namely, Ulster, Meath, Munster, Leinster, and Connaught; and of the five princes who ruled these divisions, he that was most distinguished for his valour, wisdom, and power, was, by the others, elected and acknowledged king or monarch of Ireland; who enjoyed the same preheminence of rank and prerogative of presiding in the general assembly, as had been formerly vested in the monarch or chief of the Saxon confederacy: but, besides these principal so∣vereigns, a great number of lesser potentates in Ireland assumed the appellation of king, which, in their language, implied no more than lord or superior. Ire∣land was never subdued by the Romans, though it agreed to pay tribute to that people, for the conveniency of trade with different parts of the empire. It was invaded by Egfrid, king of Northumberland, who was obliged to desist from his enterprize with precipitation and disgrace. The Danes afterwards made descents upon the country: though they were generally repulsed, until the famous Tur∣gis landed with a powerful army, and subdued the greatest part of Connaught, Ulster, Meath, and Leinster. That prince triumphed about thirty years; but was at last slain by Melachlin, king of Meath, in the isle of Lochvair, and the greatest part of his forces, dispersed in different provinces of the country, were cut off by the natives. The next descent was made by Aulaf and his two bro∣thers, from Norway, who transported a strong body of forces to Ireland, and built the cities of Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, as capitals of three dis∣tinct kingdoms, comprehending a small extent of territory along the sea-side, which they fortified with castles, and maintained with occasional supplies from Norway and the western isles of Scotland. The native Irish kings possessed an

<P>Such was the situation of the Irish, when Dermot Macmorrogh, king of Leinster, carried off Dervogill, daughter of Melachlin, prince of Meath, and wife of Tigernac O Rourke, lord of Breany, who being joined by O Connor, king of Connaught, and monarch of Ireland, marched against the ravisher, routed his forces, and compelled him to take refuge in England. Henry being at this time in Guienne, Dermot went thither, and offered to hold his kingdom of the English crown, if he should recover it by the king's assis∣tance. The proposal was relished, and Henry having other employment for his own forces, granted letters-patent, allowing any of his English subjects to assist the Irish prince. Dermot returning to Bristol, agreed to bestow his only daugh∣ter Eva in marriage upon Richard, surnamed Strongbow, lord of Strigal and earl of Pembroke, and to declare him his successor, in consideration of a body of forces which the earl furnished for his restoration. He at the same time con∣tracted for succours with Robert Fitzstephens and Maurice Fitzgerald, whom he promised to gratify with the city of Wexford, and the two adjoining districts, though at that time in the hands of the Easterlings: then he retired privately to Ireland, and concealed himself during the winter in the monastery of Ferns, which he had founded.</P>

<P>In the succeeding spring, Robert Fitzstephens, with his nephew Meyler Fitzhenry, Milo Fitzdavid, and Hervey de Montmerency, landed in Bannogh Bay, in the county of Wexford, with sixty knights, and three hundred archers, and being joined by Maurice de Prendergast with a small reinforce∣ment, and afterwards by the troops of Dermot, they advanced to the siege of Wexford; which was soon reduced. The Irish king made it over immediately to Robert and Maurice, with the territories, according to promise; and bestowed two other districts near the sea, betwixt Wexford and Waterford, on Hervey de Montmerency, from whom they devolved to the house of Ormond. Dermot's next expedition was against Donald, king of Ossory, who was routed and sub∣dued by the valour of the English. Roderic, monarch of Ireland, alarmed at these conquests, sollicited all the petty kings of the island to join their forces, and stop the progress of these invaders; but, in the mean time, endeavoured by a negociation to prevail upon them to leave the country. Failing in this attempt, he concluded a private treaty with Dermot, to whose son he agreed to give his daughter in marriage: but a new reinforcement arriving from England, under the command of Maurice Fitzgerald, he renounced his engagement, and
<PB N="337" REF="3460"/>
undertook the siege of Dublin, which in a little time capitulated, and was left in possession of Asculf, the Danish prince, to whom it belonged.</P>

<P>Dermot not contented with the recovery of his lands in Leinster, resolved to reduce Connaught also to his obedience; but Robert and Maurice being consulted on the subject, advised him to wait for the arrival of further suc∣cours; and to remind Richard Strongbow of his promise. That nobleman, though prohibited by Henry to embark in this expedition, sent over Remond le Gros with ten cavaliers and seventy archers, who landed at Dundevil, in the neighbourhood of Waterford, where they were immediately attacked by a body of three thousand Danes and Irish, whom they defeated with great slaughter, by the assistance of Henry de Montmerency, who came accidentally with a party of his followers to visit Remond. In about three months after this action, Rich∣ard in person made a descent, with two hundred knights and half that number of archers, near Waterford; which he took by assault, and there he found Reynold, prince of the Danish inhabitants, and Malachias O Phelan, lord of Decies. In this city Richard's marriage was solemnized with Eva, and he and his wife declared successors of Dermot, whose son was, at that time, hostage with Roderic, for performance of the treaty which the father had concluded with that prince. From Waterford the earl advanced to Dublin, which he likewise took by storm; while Asculf, with a great number of the inhabitants, escaped by sea to the Orkneys: then they ravaged the country of Meath, till the approach of winter, when leaving Miles Cogan with a garrison in Dublin, Strongbow re∣turned to Waterford, and Dermot retired to Ferns.</P>

<P>These conquests alarmed Henry, king of England, who took um∣brage at the success of Richard, already too powerful by his possessions in Wales, his connections and alliances. A proclamation was therefore published, command∣ing all the subjects of England to return to their own country, and forbidding any further succours to be sent into Ireland. In consequence of this order Rich∣ard dispatched Remond to Normandy, with letters full of expressions of duty and submission to the king, and offers to resign into his majesty's hands all the conquests he had atchieved. By these concessions he retrieved the favour of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern.

Asculf having assembled a considerable body of forces in Norway, the Orkneys, and Hebrides, transported them in threescore ships to the mouth of the Liffy, and made an attempt upon Dublin; but, he was de∣feated and taken by Miles Cogan, who ordered him to be put to death, for hav∣ing reviled him in abusive language. Mean while Roderic was employed in making great preparations for the expulsion of the English. He levied a numerous army in his own territories and those of his neighbours, and was reinforced with a strong body of auxiliaries, by Godred, king of Man and the Western Islands; with these he invested Dublin, into which Richard had thrown himself with a small supply of forces. The place was blocked up in such a manner, that the besieged could receive no provision; so that famine must have ensued, had not Strongbow made a sally one morning, and fallen suddenly upon the enemy with such fury, that they were immediately routed with great slaughter. Then Richard marched to the relief of Robert Fitzstephens, who was besieged in

In his progress through Wales, he had received the submission of Rese, and the sons of Owen Guineth, among whom a civil war had broke out, from the contest about the government. This quarrel produced such mischief and effusion of blood, that Madoc, one of the brothers, resolved to abandon his native country, and, having equipped a few ships, sailed with his adherents to the north of Ireland, in quest of some new habitation; then steering westward, arrived at an unknown land, which was in all probability the coast of America. There he formed a settlement, and returning gave such an advantageous account of the country, that a great number of families were per∣suaded to follow his fortune; and with these he set fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l again in ten ships for his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Powel's Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Wales.</NOTE> infant colony.

<P>But to return to Henry: he was no sooner landed in Ireland, than the natives submitted; and as for Strongbow, he had, in obedience to the king's order, conveyed by Hervey de Montmerency, returned to England and met the king at Newenham, in Gloucestershire, when he resigned to his majesty all the possessions, in Ireland, which he held in right of his wife or by conquest: and Henry reconvey∣ed to him, as a fief of the crown, the whole province of Leinster, except the city of Dublin, with the adjacent countries, and some maritime towns and castles. In Richard's absence Tigernack O Rourke had made another attempt upon Dub∣lin, and been defeated by Miles Cogan: and this was the last effort of the Danes and Irish to maintain their independency; for when the king landed, the whole country submitted. He had sent Robert Fitz-Bernard before him to take posses∣sion of Waterford, where Richard now did homage for his province of Leinster. There too, Dermot Maccarty, king of Corke, swore fealty, and delivered hostages for the payment of an annual tribute. After a fortnight's stay at Waterford, Henry marched to Lesmore and Cashel, and received the submission of Donald, king of Os<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory; Malachias or Melachlin O Phelan, king of Decies; Reynald, prince of Waterford, and Donald O Brian, king of Thomond or Limerick.

<P>All the bishops of Ireland had repaired to Waterford, at Henry's landing, to welcome him on his arrival, and take the oath of allegiance; for they expected from his piety, wisdom, and justice, a full reformation of the disor∣ders and immoralities, which their influence alone could not eradicate. The common people among the English, under the Saxon government, had been used to sell their children as slaves to the Irish; and this practice, though con∣demned by the ecclesiastical canons, was still carried on after the Norman conquest, to the great scandal of Christianity. The Irish bishops therefore, supposing this infamous traffic had drawn upon the English the judgement of God, in the Norman conquest, and that Ireland, for encouraging it, was now enslaved in its turn, assembled a synod at Armagh, where, with the general con∣sent of the nobility, all the English slaves were ordered to be set at liberty; a law, by which they effectually made their court to their new master. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry, that he might in some measure answer the expectations of his new subjects, convoked a general council of the clergy at Cashel, where Christian, bishop of Lismore, presided as the pope's legate in that kingdom; and Ralf, abbot of Buldewas, the archdeacon of Landaff, and some of the king's chaplains assisted at this assembly, in order to promote a perfect con∣formity between the churches of England and Ireland. Several canons were accordingly enacted for executing the design, forbidding polygamy, ascertaining the rites of baptism and burial, and all divine offices; providing for the pay∣ment of tythes, and the exemption of the clergy from secular service and impo∣sition; and impowering individuals to make wills, and divide their personal estates among their wives and children. These constitutions, comprehending some other regulations for the security of peace and property, were confirmed by the royal authority, and transmitted to Rome, with an instrument signed by all the prelates of Ireland, acknowledging Henry and his heirs as their kings and lords for ever. Alexander, foreseeing his own advantage in this conquest, re∣cognized the title of Henry, and confirmed the grant of his predecessor Adrian;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. Bened.

<P>The winter he passed in Ireland was so stormy, that, for several months, all correspondence with England was interrupted, till the king re∣moved from Dublin to Wexford, where he received advice that the cardinals Albert and Theodin had waited for him in Normandy, till their patience was quite exhausted; and then they threatened to excommunicate him for the mur∣der of Becket, in case he should not come over immediately, and clear himself of that accusation. At the same time he was informed of a dangerous conspi∣racy against his government, both in England and Normandy, as well as of en∣deavours, which had been used to alienate the affections of his own children.
<PB N="340" REF="3490"/>
Though he had proposed to pass the summer in Ireland, and make an expedition into Connaught, when the roads should be practicable, he no sooner received those alarming advices, than he ordered his troops to embark with the officers of his houshold, and set sail from Waterford to England, while he only kept three ships for himself and his attendants, as he could not cross the sea in person until he should have taken measures for securing his conquests, as well against the attempts of the Irish princes, as from the ambition of Richard Strongbow, whom he still beheld with an eye of jealousy. With this view he had detached Remond le gros, Miles Cogan, William Macarel, and others, from the earl's interests, and committed the governments of all the fortified places to persons of known fidelity. He granted the hundred of Offaly to Robert Fitzstephens; Waterford was entrusted to Robert Poer; Wexford to William Fitz-Aldhelm; and Dublin to Hugh de Lacy; with sufficient garrisons under their command. He likewise granted a patent to John de Courcy, for attempting the conquest of the north of Ulster, the only part of Ireland which had not yet submitted to his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern.

<P>This disposition being settled, as well as the circumstances of the time would permit, he embarked in the morning at Wexford, and landed that same day at Portsinan, near St. David's, in Pembrokeshire; and as it was his interest to give immediate satisfaction to the legates, he passed through England without halting, till he reached Portsmouth, from whence he carried the young king with him into Normandy. His first conference with the cardinals at Gor∣ham, passed in compliment and ceremony; but next day, when they met at Sa∣vigny, in presence of the archbishop of Rouen, and a great number of prelates and nobility, the legates insisted upon such unreasonable terms, that the king withdrew in a great passion, declaring he would return to finish the conquest of Ireland, and they might do what they pleased with their legatine commission. The cardinals pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceiving his fortitude and resolution, were fain to abate in their demands, and desired another conference might be appointed at Avranches, where, after much altercation and debate, it was at last agreed, by both parties, that the king should pay to the knights templars, a sum of money sufficient for the subsistence of two hundred knights, to be employed one year in the de∣fence of the Holy Land: that he himself should take the cross, and serve in per∣son against the insidels, either in Palestine or Spain, if the pope should insist up∣on the performance of this article; that he should not interrupt the free course of appeals to Rome, in ecclesiastical causes; nor enforce the observance of evil customs, introduced since his accession to the throne; that he should restore all the lands which had been ahenated from the see of Canterbury, since the exile of Becker; and that he should re-establish all persons who had suffered for their adherence to that bishop, in full possession of their estates. To the performance of these conditions, Henry and his son swore in the cathedral of Avranches; and the father, of his own accord, protested upon oath, that he was in no shape a willing accessary to the death of Becket, which had overwhelmed him with grief and anxiety; but as the archbishop had been murdered, in consequence of the displeasure he had expressed at that prelate's proceedings, he would perform the penance prescribed. He was then led out of the church by the legates, and,
<PB N="341" REF="3500"/>
falling upon his knees, received absolution, which was no sooner granted, than they re-conducted him into the cathedral, without subjecting him to the disci∣pline, and obliging him to shift his clothes, or undergo any penitential ceremo∣ny. The young king swore he would fulfil the penance, in case his father should die before the completion of it; and both princes promised they would adhere to pope Alexander and his successors, as long as they should own them for christian and catholic kings. This treaty of accommodation was signed and sealed by the legates, who notified the articles to the archbishop of Tours and his suffragans, that the kingdom of France might be informed of all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>THE cardinals, having so happily succeeded in compleating this re∣conciliation between his holiness and Henry, resolved to exert them∣selves in effecting another between that prince and Lewis king of France, who resented Henry's non-performance of the promise he had made to crown his daughter Margaret together with her husband. In consequence of their media∣tion, the young king and this princess were sent over to England, with the arch∣bishop of Rouen, who anointed and crowned her with her consort, in the church of St. Swithin at Winchester, being assisted in the ceremony by the bishops of Evreux and Worcester. Some time after this solemnity, the young king and queen returned to Normandy, from whence they set out on a visit to the king of France, at the earnest request of that monarch, who was extremely fond of his daughter.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Henry's affairs were now in a most flourishing condition: he had in∣creased the revenue of Normandy, which obeyed him without repining: he had made an acquisition of the kingdom of Ireland; was master of all Bretagne by the death of Conan, whose daughter had espoused his son Geoffrey: he had formed an alliance with Alphonso, king of Castile, to whom he had given his daughter Eleanor in marriage: he had projected a match between his youngest son John, and Adelais daughter of Humbert count of Savoy: he was delivered from all his ecclesiastical troubles, by his reconciliation with the pope; and he was beloved by all his subjects, who lived happily under his administration. But his happi∣ness was now poisoned by domestic disquiet. His son Henry was a weak, vain, ambitious prince, who affected a popularity which he acquired by the most pro∣fuse largesses. His extravagance and excesses involved him in want and diffi∣culties, which his settled appointments did not enable him to overcome: he found himself hampered by the oeconomy, and eclipsed by the superior impor∣tance of his father; he longed to reign without restra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt; and his heart renounced the ties of natural affection. This disposition was industriously cultivated by his favourites and sycophants, of which the chief were Hugh de St. Maure, and Ralf de Faye, the uncle of queen Eleanor, who, in all probability, acted in this particular as the emissaries of the French king, jealous of Henry's power and prosperity. During the young king's residence at that court, every artifice was used to inflame his discontent, and irritate him against his father. Lewis ob∣served that he was no more than the shadow of royalty; that his power was even more circumscribed than that of a private nobleman; that his appointments were meanly parsimonious; that the restrictions imposed upon his authority, were not
<PB N="344" REF="3530"/>
only inconveniences, but insults upon his understanding; and that he was in∣titled to the independent government of the kingdom, ever since the ceremony of his coronation. When he had thus wrought upon the passions of the young prince, he undertook to superintend his conduct, and instructed him with regard to the measures he should take for his own glory and advantage. Thus tutored he returned to Normandy at the desire of his father, who began to be uneasy at<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. G. Neub. Hoved. Rob. de Monte.</NOTE> his staying so long in a place, where he knew designs were often hatching to his prejudice; and immediately after his arrival, he demanded that the old king would resign to him the absolute government of England or Normandy: a pro∣posal with which the father refused to comply.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning of the succeeding year, the king, with Eleanor and his eldest son, proceeded to Limoges, where they were met by Raymond, count de St. Giles, who came to do homage for the county of Tholouse; and Humbert, count of Savoy, to finish the treaty of marriage between prince John and his daughter Adelais. The portion of this young princess consisted of very consi∣derable demesnes in La Bresse, Dauphiny, Savoy and Piedmont; and the king agreed to bestow upon John, besides a large sum of money, the castles of Lou∣dun, Mirebeau, and Chinon. This alliance would have proved very advan∣tageous to the king of England, had it not been prevented by the death of the princess: but it was upon this occasion, that young Henry first expressed his discontent, by flatly refusing to join in the grant of those castles to his brother. The father now, for the first time, discovered his son's aversion to his person and government, and imputing it to evil advice, removed Asculf de Hilaire, and some other young knights from his communication: a step which served only to hasten his retreat; for, when the court returned to Chinon, he privately withdrew into France, where Lewis had promised to espouse his quarrel. The king, extremely concerned at his disappearing, sent ambassadors to the French king, desiring that he would not countenance a rebellious son against his father, and offering to submit all Henry's pretensions to his arbitration: but the propo∣sal was rejected with disdain; and Lewis, in a taunting letter, affirmed that he had resigned all his right to the crown of England, at his son's coronation. Young Henry's retreat was the first overtact of a conspiracy, which seems to have been formed during the father's residence in Ireland. A great number of Norman barons, who, upon the late inquisition, had lost estates, which they possessed by defective titles, now expected to recover their lands, and followed young Henry to the court of France: others more considerable staid at home, but openly declared in his favour, and surrendered their castles for his service. Guy and Geoffrey de Luzignan, with a number of the lords in Anjou and Guienne, followed their example; and an insurrection was raised in Brittany by Ralf de Fougeres and Eudo, viscount Parhoet, father-in-law to the late duke Conan. These troubles were encouraged by queen Eleanor, who, as well as Richard and Geoffrey, had by this time embarked in the rebellion, not instigated by jealousy of her husband's amour with the fair Rosamond, daughter of Wal∣ter de Clifford, a baron of Herefordshire, as some historians have alledged, but inflamed with resentment at the king's leaving her no part of the administra∣tion of her own native possessions on the continent; and influenced by her partial fondness for her own offspring. Rosamond must have been by this time in the wane of her beauty, inasmuch as the younger of the sons she bore to
<PB N="345" REF="3540"/>
Henry was now turned of twenty years of age. Eleanor's second son Richard had already given specimens of a turbulent disposition, and thought himself entitled to the administration of Poitou, because he had received the in∣vestiture of that county; and Geoffrey, though but fifteen, had the same claim to Bretagne: but at present they acted under the immediate direction of their mother, who not only persuaded them to escape into France, and join Henry, but attempted to follow their example. She disguised herself in man's apparel; but, before she could accomplish her retreat, was taken in that disguise, and committed to close prison, where she was kept many years, as the principal cause of all this disturbance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>Henry finding himself beset with enemies in this manner, abandoned by his own wife and children, threatened with the vengeance of Lewis, king of France, who professed himself the patron of the confederacy, surrounded with insurrections in all parts of his dominions, and even exposed to the risque of assassination; he summoned all his fortitude and resolution to oppose such a torrent of misfortune; sent ambassadors to interest the pope in his behalf; filled the see of Canterbury with Richard, prior of Dover, a prelate of a mild disposition, whom the pope afterwards consecrated and invested with the primacy; and took into his service twenty thousand soldiers of fortune, called Brabantins and Banditti, who subsisted upon plunder, and were ready to engage in the service of any prince who could pay them punctually. They were generally natives of France, Germany, and the Low Countries, who, having served under different banners, were inured to danger, fatigue, and military discipline, and so habituated to war, that they could not resume the employments and avocations of peace. Perhaps this was as wise a step as he could take at a time of general defection, when he could not trust his own subjects; for, by this time, the contagion had spread into England, where the earls of Chester and Leicester had pub∣licly avowed their attachment to young Henry: several barons, to whom he had committed the charge of strong fortresses in Normandy, had betrayed their trust; and therefore he garrisoned the rest with part of his mercenaries, and kept a body of the same troops ready to march wheresoever their service should be more immediately required.</P>

<P>The king of France, summoning all his prelates and nobility to Paris, took a solemn oath in their presence, importing, that he would assist young Henry and his brothers with all his power, until the father should be expelled from the throne of England; the nobility incurred the same obligation; and the princes swore, in their turns, that they would never agree to a peace with their father, until it should have first been approved by the king of France and his barons. Henry, being furnished with a new seal by the direction of his father-in-law, disposed of the crown demesnes with a lavish hand, to several princes who espoused his quarrel. To the count of Flanders he granted lands to the amount of a thousand pounds a year, with the castles of Dover and Ro∣chester, reputed in those days the keys of the kingdom; Kirketon in Lindsey, with the county of Montague in Normandy, were given to the count of Bou∣logne: Theobald, count de Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, was gratified with a considerable annuity, the castle of Amboise, all Henry's possessions in Touraine, with a release of all his own and his father's claim to Chateau-Renaud: William, king of Scotland, as a member of this confederacy, was indulged with a grant of all Northum∣berland

<P>The storm, which had been brewing so long, was seen to burst at once in Normandy, Guienne, Anjou, and Bretagne, where the different parties of the revolters ravaged the country for some time, without controul; while the old king lay still at the head of his army, to observe the nature of the commotion, and see where the greatest effort would be made by the enemy. Philip, count of F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anders, with his brother Matthew of Boulogne, marching through Picar∣dy, invested Aumale, which was treacherously surrendered by the governor to him: they reduced Neufchatel, and over-ran the county of Eu, in which Mat∣thew being mortally wounded with an arrow, the brother retired to his own country to regulate the affairs of his succession, disordered by this accident. During these transactions the French king, at the head of a great army, invaded Normandy on the side of the Pais Chartrain, and undertook the siege of Ver∣nueil, which was gallantly defended by Hugh de Beauchamp and Hugh de La∣cy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE> who had come over to the king's assistance, with Richard Strongbow and a select body of knights, from Ireland. The town was well fortified and popu∣lous, and the inhabitants sustained several assaults with undaunted resolution, till at last, reduced to extremity by want of provisions, they demanded a truce for three days, that they might send an account of their situation to the king of England, and they delivered hostages for surrendering the place in case he should not march to their relief before the expiration of that term.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Henry, who was encamped at Conches, being apprized of this agree∣ment, immediately began his march, and though inferior in point of number to the French, resolved to hazard an engagement. He had advanced as far as the castle of Breteuil, when he was met by the archbishop of Sens, and the counts of Dreux and Blois, who, in the name of the French king, proposed a treaty of peace between him and his sons, and agreed to a truce for the next day, when the articles should be adjusted at a conference with Lewis and the English princes. Henry, suspecting no deceit, retired towards Conches, and, advancing again next morning to the place appointed, instead of meeting with the French king, beheld Vernueil in flames. This being the day fixed for the surrender of the place, it was delivered to Lewis, who allowed it to be pillaged and burnt, and carried off the hostages. Having acted in this cruel and treacherous man∣ner, he retreated with such precipitation, that his provision and baggage fell into the hands of Henry, who pursued his forces, and had the good fortune to cut in pieces part of his rear: then he entered Vernueil, the damage of which he re∣paired; next day he took Danville, a castle belonging to Gilbert de Tillieres, in which he found a great number of knights and gentlemen; and being no longer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Benedict.

<P>From thence he sent a detachment of Brabantins towards Bretagne, where Ralph de Fougeres was joined by the earl of Chester and some other lords, who had reduced several castles, and infested the borders of Normandy. The troops of Henry being accustomed to dispatch, made such hasty marches, that the rebels were almost surprized at Fougeres, from whence they fled with great

precipi∣tation, leaving behind an immense booty. They afterwards united all their forces, and gave battle to the Brabantins, who defeated them in the field, took above twenty barons prisoners, and immediately invested the castle of Dol, to which the rest fled for refuge. Henry was no sooner informed of this circum∣stance, than he set out for the place, and found the town already taken; and though the castle held out a few days longer, it was at last surrendered by Ralf de Fougeres, who, with about an hundred knights and barons, were committed to close custody. <NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>Such a blow could not fail to ruin their scheme in Brittany, where all, who had taken arms, submitted to Henry's mercy; and the fame of his success, re-established his affairs in other parts of his dominions. Some of the adherents of the young princes, disappointed in their sanguine hopes, and ap∣prehensive of being ruined by the revolt, advised them to make proposals of peace, to which Henry lent a willing ear. Conferences were opened near Gisors, between the kings of France and England, at which the young princes assisted, with a great number of prelates and nobility. Henry offered to settle upon his eldest son half of the revenue of England, with four places of strength in that king∣dom: or should he chuse to reside in Normandy, half the revenue of the dutchy, the whole of Anjou, with six castles. He proposed, that Richard should have half the revenue of Guienne, with four castles; that Geoffrey should be put in possession of Conan's territories in Bretagne, provided the pope would grant a dispensation for his marriage with the heiress; and he declared that, if this pro∣vision should not be thought sufficient, he would refer the dispute to the arbitra∣tion of the archbishop of Tarentaise and the pope's legates; reserving to himself, however, the administration of justice, with all the other branches of the regal prerogative. Lewis, whose interest it was to see the empire of Henry dis∣membred, began to start difficulties, and the young princes rejected these reason∣able proposals, chiefly at the instigation of Robert Blanches-Mains, earl of Lei∣cester, who was one of the first projectors of this rebellion. He had come over from England with William de Tancarville, to succour the revolters with a large sum of money borrowed on his estate; and became the most virulent partisan of the whole faction. He, upon this occasion, broke out into the most opprobri∣ous invectives against the king, to whom he had lately renewed the oath of allegiance, and even laid his hand upon his sword, in order to excite a tumult; which put an end to the conference. The king and his sons parted with great animosity: the latter became more and more attached to Lewis, who, about this period, knighted Richard in the seventeenth year of his age; and this cam∣paign<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.

<P>William, king of Scotland, in order to co-operate with the other confe∣derates, invaded the northern counties in England, where his troops committed the most barbarous outrages. After having made an unsucces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful attempt upon Carlisle, he ravaged Northumberland, and penetrated as far as Yorkshire, from whence he carried off a vast booty, and a great number of captives. He was pursued into his own country by Richard de Lacy, and Humphrey de Bohun, constable of England, who followed him with a good army, burned Berwick, and wasted Lothian; but being informed of a descent in Suffolk, by the earl of Leicester, with a numerous body of Flemings, they agreed upon a truce with

<P>This cessation from hostilities was employed in preparing for a vigo∣rous renewal of the war.

<P>The truce with Scotland having expired, William, at the head of a numerous army, reinforced with a body of horse and foot from Flanders, made an irruption into Northumberland, where his Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lovidians committed horrible cruelties upon men, women, and children, laity as well as clergy, some of whom they massacred even at the altar. David, earl of Huntingdon, was detached into Leicestershire, to encourage an insurrection in that country; while William re∣mained in the north, where he reduced several strong holds, and levied contri∣but ons. During these transactions, Roger de Mowbray made excursions from his castle of Kenard-Ferry over all Lincolnshire; until his progress was stopped by Geoffrey the king's natural son, now promoted to the see of Lincoln.

In this emergency, Richard de Lacey, guardian of the realm, sollicited the assistance of Rese, prince of South-Wales, who marched against earl Ferrers, and besieged his castle of Tutbury in Staffordshire, while Richard himself took the field with a numerous army, in order to oppose the young king and Philip, count of Flanders, who had assem∣bled a formidable body of forces at Gravelines, with a view to invade England.</P>

<P>Henry the elder, having by this time quelled the insurrections in his foreign dominions, summoned all the Norman nobility and governors of fortresses to meet him at Bonneville, in order to deliberate upon measures for the security of his frontiers, while he should be in England. Richard, elect of Winchester, had gone over, at the request of the lords justices and the chief nobility, to represent the necessity of his immediate return; and he had no sooner given proper directions for the defence of his frontiers against a projected invasion of the French king, than he proceeded, with the two queens, the earls of Chester and Leicester, and some other prisoners, to Barfleur, where he em∣barked for England, and that same evening arrived at Southampton.

He walked barefoot from St. Dunstan's church without the city walls, to Christ church; submitted to the discipline of the monks, who scourged him severely; spent a whole day in fasting and prayer; watched all night near Becket's tomb; made a grant of fifty pounds a year to the con∣vent, for a constant supply of tapers to burn at his shrine; and having received absolution, repaired to London, where he was next day agreeably surprized with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Girald.

<P>William, king of Scotland, had besieged Prudhaw castle, until the English army under Ralf de Glanville, with a great number of other noblemen and Yorkshire barons, advancing to its relief, he thought proper to relinquish the enterprize, and retreat to Alnwick. There deeming himself secure from any attack, he detached the earl of Fife, Angus, and Richard de Moreville, consta∣ble of Scotland, to ravage the adjoining countries, while he himself retained scarce any troops but those of his houshold, for the defence of his own person. Ralf de Glanville being informed of this circumstance, proposed to some of the principal barons, that they should surprize William with four hundred horse; and the atchievement was undertaken by Robert d'Estouteville, Bernard de Ba∣liol, William de Vesei, and Geoffrey of Lincoln, who set out on this expedition with great secresy. They refreshed themselves at Newcastle, where they resumed their march at the dawn of day, and being concealed by a thick fog, arrived in the neighbourhood of Alnwick, where they found William in an open plain, attended by an hundred horse, and so secure from any apprehension of an enemy, that he mistook them for a detachment of his own army.

<P>This exploit was of infinite consequence to the re-establishment of Henry's affairs.

The enterprize at Alnwick was celebrated with public re∣joicings all over the kingdom; and Henry, in order to improve the advantage, before his enemies should recollect themselves from the consternation occasioned among them by this unlucky event, marched immediately to the castle of Hun∣tingdon, which surrendered at discretion: then he advanced against Hugh Bigot, who submitted to the king's mercy, delivered his castles, paid a thousand marks, gave hostages, and took the oath of allegiance anew. The king having put gar∣risons in the forts, repaired to Northampton, where the bishop of Durham made his submiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and resigned his fortresses of Norham, Durham, and Northal∣lerton.

While the citizens gave themselves up to feast∣ing, mirth and jollity, and their cavaliers crossed the bridge to the south side of the river, where they divert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves in tilts and tournaments, in sight of the enemy; a few priests who did not chuse to mix in the entertainments of the day, ascended an high tower, in order to indulge their curiosity with a prospect of the French camp. They were at first surprized at the unusual silence that prevailed over all their quarters; but, in a little time, perceiving detachments moving from different places to a general rendezvous, they began to suspect some treachery, and were soon confirmed in that conjecture, by discovering among them a number of ladders, and other implements for an assault. They imme∣diately rang the alarm bell, which happened to be in the very place from whence they made these observations. The citizens, snatching up their arms, ran di∣rectly to the walls; and the horsemen, exercising on the other side of the river, repaired to their posts, with all imaginable expedition, though they were almost too late; for the enemy hearing the bell, had hastened their attack, applied their ladders; and some of the soldiers had actually mounted the walls, before the defendants could take their stations.

<P>This treacherous scheme, was, in all probability, concerted to an∣ticipate the diligence of Henry, who, being apprized of the danger that threatened his favourite capital, had immediately assembled his troops, and landed already at Barfleur with his Brabantins, reinforced by a thousand Welsh auxiliaries. He carried over with him the king of Scotland, the earls of Chester and Lei∣cester, and some other considerable captives, and securing them at Caen and Falaise, advanced to Rouen, which he entered in triumph on the Sunday that suc∣ceeded the perfidious attempt of the French. He forthwith ordered the gates to be thrown open, and the intrenchments between the city and the enemy's camp to be filled up, so as to form a road of sufficient breadth to admit a front of two hundred men, that he might have room enough to attack the besiegers. He made some successful sallies: his Welsh troops intercepted a great convoy of provisions designed for the French camp: and Lewis was overwhelmed with con∣sternation; for he found himself in the midst of an enemy's country, destitute of supplies, surrounded with woods and mountains, and exposed to the vigilance of an active monarch, at the head of veteran troops accustomed to victory. In this distress, he had recourse to artifice and negotiation. He sent the archbishop of Sens, and the count of Blois with overtures of peace; and though Henry had been duped on a former occasion, by the insincere insinuations of these very ambassadors, he was so averse to war, and unwilling to act against Lewis, whom he considered as his lord and superior, that he agreed to their proposal of a con∣ference to be held at Malauny, and a truce in the mean time, which they confirmed by oath in the name of their sovereign. On the faith of this agree∣ment, Lewis retreated through the forest, unmolested, towards the place ap∣pointed; but, instead of waiting for the conference, decamped at midnight, and marched homewards with such expedition, that next day, when his departure was known, it was with great difficulty that the Brabantins overtook the strag∣glers of his rear, who were cut in pieces. In a few days, however, the two ambassadors returned to Rouen, and, after having made an apology for their
<PB N="352" REF="3610"/>
king's retreat, proposed another conference at Gisors, where a truce was con∣cluded, after they had agreed upon a final <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meeting at a place near Amboise, in order to adjust the articles of a solid peace, which could not now be established on account of the absence of prince Richard, who was employed in attacking his fath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r's castles in Guienne. One of the articles of this truce imported that Henry sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld be at liberty to reduce this rebellious son, who should have no assistance from Lewis or his brother. Thus left to his own efforts, he was hunted by his father from place to place; and finding himself abandoned by the French king, he repaired to Poitiers, where he humbled himself before his parent, who par∣doned his unnatural conduct, and received him with all the warmth of paternal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Thus Henry, by his admirable prudence, unshaken fortitude, in∣vincible courage, and amazing activity, triumphed at last over all his enemies, after having defeated a conspiracy, perhaps the most dangerous and perplexing that ever was formed against any prince of Christendom: and no part of his con∣duct shone with so much splendour, as the magnanimity and moderation he manifested in his behaviour towards those who had exerted all their endeavours for his destruction. Far from offering hecatombs of the vanquished to justice or revenge, and deluging the land with the blood of his rebellious subjects, after the flames of civil war had been extinguished, his generosity and greatness of soul disdained such cruel victims; his compassion operated in behalf o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tressed offenders; he did not lay aside the father to exert the judge, but in his judgment remembred mercy. There was not one scaffold moistened with the blood of a nobleman; there was not one gibbet occupied by a rebel of plebeian rank. He released above nine hundred knights without ransom; he bestowed a new grant of a yearly pension upon the count of Flanders, who gave up the con∣ventions he had made with young Henry; and he readmitted his own undutiful children into his favour, as if they had never transgressed. When the princes of Galloway shook off the Scottish yoke, and asserted their independency<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had from the dictates of sound policy, supported them in their revolt; and Roger de Hoveden the historian, who was one of his chaplains, had been sent to treat with Gilbert, and the other chieftains of the country, who offered an annual tribute of money, cows and hogs, for his protection and a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance, in rescuing them from the dominion of the Scots; but, when Henry heard how barbarously that prince had put his own brother Uchtred to death, he broke off all connexion with such inhuman people, and compromised his difference with William, king of Scot∣land.</P>

<P>These treaties being concluded and ratified, Henry had an interview with the king of France at Gisors, where all matters in dispute between the two crowns, were settled to their mutual satisfaction. The fortresses erected during the war were now demolished, and the castles of Anjou and Poitou secured with strong garrisons; but the king still found his eldest son sullen, and averse to a hearty reconciliation. He seemed to doubt his father's sincerity; and re∣fused to obey when he was summoned to court: perhaps his father-in-law en∣couraged<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1175.</NOTE> and infused these suspicions. Conscious of his own ingratitude and misconduct, he could not believe himself heartily forgiven, and gave out that there was an intention to confine him to close prison. He would not release the prisoners he had taken, without ransom; and plainly demonstrated, both by his words and actions, that he wanted nothing but power to renew the rebellion. Henry was shocked at his unnatural disposition, and sent several messages to convince him of his paternal tenderness. At length he seemed to be satisfied, and coming to Bures, fell upon his knees, imploring the king's forgiveness. He was joyfully received; took the oath of allegiance, at his own earnest request; was allowed to make a short visit to the court of France, and, at his return, accompanied his father to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duet.

<P>At Westminster they found Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, presiding in a synod, which enacted several canons for facilitating and inforcing the payment of tythes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reforming the morals and habit of the clergy, and regu∣lating presentations, rites and ceremonies. In this assembly, the king's letter, notifying his reconciliation with young Henry, was read in presence of that prince, who took the oaths of homage and allegiance, and publicly renounced all assistance from the king of France and his brothers, the prelates and monks of England, Normandy, and Guienne, provided he should ever deviate for the future from his filial obedience. Upon this occasion, the dispute was renewed between the archbishops of Canterbury and York touching the privileges of the two fees. Richard had obtained the primacy of all England, and a lega∣tine power within his own province. Roger of York was vested with the same authority over Scotland, and pretended to the right of carrying his cross erect within the jurisdiction of Canterbury. They envied and took all occasions of mortifying each other. Richard excommunicated the clergy of a chapel be∣longing to the province of York, for contempt of his orders. He suspended the dean of Waltham; and appointed an abbess at W nchester in spite of the nuns, who had the right of election. The archbishop of York appealed to the pope, from some of his censures and claims. Cardinal Hugozun was sent over to ter∣minate these disputes. Richard was fain to retract his censures, and resign his pretensions. Godfrey, bishop of St. Asaph, relinquished his see, because it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. J. Abb.

That of Norwich, and twelve abbeys being now also vacant, the king issued writs, requiring the chapters and convents to send depu∣tations to Oxford at a certain day, to fill up those vac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncies, and in the mean time he visited the marches of Wales.</P>

of the marches in a mutual oath, to assist each other in case they should be at∣tacked by the Welsh, who did not own his royal authority. From hence Henry repaired to Wodestoke, where he held his court: the delegates of Nor∣wich chose John de Oxford for their bishop; the vacant abbeys were supplied, and the election of Geoffrey, the king's natural son, to the see of Lincoln was confirmed. The king, at this juncture, seems to have suspected a conspiracy against his life; for he published a proclamation, forbidding all persons to enter his court without permission, and those who belonged to it, or came upon leave or summons, to remain after sun-set, or approach it before sun-rise. Another ordinance was published at the same time, to prevent people from carrying bows, arrows, or pointed daggers, on the English side of the Severne. Four knights, with their accomplices, were tried, convicted and hanged for the murder of one Gilbert, a forester.</P>

<P>Henry proceeding to Nottingham, punished all transgressors of the game laws, which he restored to their full vigour; demolished the castles belonging to the noblemen who had been concerned in the late rebellion, and advanced to York, in consequence of an appointment with William, king of Scotland, who had been set at liberty in the beginning of the year.

<P>The peace with Scotland being firmly established, Henry returned to Windsor, where he convoked a council, to deliberate upon the affairs of Ire∣land, which were re-involved in confusion. Richard Strongbow, Robert Fitz∣stephens, and some others of the first adventurers, had been called over to assist the king, and done signal service both in England and Normandy. In their absence, the Irish, provoked by the depredations of the soldiers left under the command of Harvey de Montmorency, and encouraged by the weakness and diminished number of their oppressors, revolted in many places; so that the whole country was thrown in confusion. Henry having triumphed over his enemies, sent Richard back to Ireland, with the title of guardian, and a grant of Wexford and Wicklow, as a recompence for his services. Raymond le Gros was, at his own desire, joined with him in the commission; and this colleague had no sooner taken possession of his post, than he made an incursion into the country of O Phelan, from whence he carried off a great boo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. This was con∣veyed by sea to Waterford in a fleet of ships, which, in their voyage, obtained a compleat victory over an armament equipped by the Easterlings of Corke. He himself marched by land with the rest of the plunder, amounting to four thousand head of cattle, and defeated Dermot Maccarty, prince of Desmond, in an engagement near Lismore. After these successes, he was, by the death of his father William Fitzgerald, obliged to cross the sea into Wales; and at his departure, the command reverted to Harvey de Montmorency. This officer
<PB N="355" REF="3640"/>
prevailed upon Strongbow to undertake an expedition into the country of Lime∣rick; but a reinforcement of four hundred Easterlings, recruited at Dublin for that service, were, in their march to join him, surprised and cut in pieces by Donald Obryen, prince of Thomond; so that the earl was forced to retire, in all haste, to Waterford, where he was in a manner besieged.</P>

<P>The Irish, elevated with this advantage, ran to arms in all quarters: Roderic, king of Connaught, passing the Shannon at the head of a numerous army, ravaged the country of Meath; while the English, abandoning the small garrisons of Trim and Dulcke, retired to Dublin, without daring to face the natives in the field. Richard, alarmed at these proceedings, wrote a letter to Raymond, to whom he promised his sister in marriage, if he would return im∣mediately with all the succours he could raise. The proposal was embraced, and Raymond embarking with thirty knights, one hundred horse, and thrice the number of Welsh archers, arrived at Waterford, from whence he accompanied the earl to Wexford, where his marriage with the fair Basilea was consummated. Then he marched into Meath, compelled Roderic to retire, and repaired the castles which had been dismantled. The king of Connaught, dreading a visit from this enterprizing commander, in his own territories, sent the archbishop of Tuam, and two other clergymen, as ambassadors to the English monarch, to sue for peace and renew his submission. To these Henry granted an audience at Windsor, where a treaty was effected, on condition that Roderic should own the king of England as his liege and sovereign, and pay every tenth hide of the cattle within his dominions; and that all his Irish subjects, holding under Roderic, should, on payment of the same tribute, be confirmed in their possessions. Roderic<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern. Expug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Bened. Abb.</NOTE> was, by virtue of this submission, secured from the attacks of Raymond, who marched against Donald, prince of Thomond, passed the Shannon in the face of the enemy, and reduced Limerick by assault. The fame of his exploits excited the envy of Montmorency, who insinuated to the king, that Raymond har∣boured a design of conquering the kingdom for himself; and Henry, who was never deaf to suggestions of this nature, sent over four commissioners, two of whom were ordered to return immediately with Raymond, and the others directed to remain in Ireland, and watch the conduct of Strongbow. These commissioners having arrived in Ireland, and signified their orders, Raymond be∣gan to prepare for his departure, and was just ready to embark, when Richard received advice that Donald, prince of Thomond, had invested Limerick; and that the garrison, being very ill provided, stood in need of immediate relief. Richard would have begun his march without loss of time; but the troops re∣fused to serve under any other commander but Raymond, who, with the leave of the commissioners, undertook the expedition. In his route he was joined by a body of Irish, under Murchard and Donald, kings of Kilkenny and Ossory, while the prince of Thomond, being apprised of his motions, raised the siege, and advanced to meet him at a narrow pass, which he fortified with trees and trenches. Raymond forced his way through these difficulties at the first onset, routed the enemy, and entered Limerick in triumph. The princes of Con∣naught and Thomond submitted to the victor, swore allegiance to king Henry, and gave hostages for their fidelity. Then Raymond marched to the assistance of Dermot Maccarty, prince of Desmond, who was in danger of being deposed by his own son Cormac O Lechan: the English general advancing towards Corke,

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Richard Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, had been dangerously ill for some time, and now dying at Dublin, without male issue, his daughter Isa∣bel became heiress of all his possessions in Leinster. His sister Basilea carefully concealed his death, until she could send advice of it to her husband Raymond, who finding it absolutely necessary to repair to Dublin, to assume the reins of government, and draw thither the greatest part of the forces, in case an insurrec∣tion should ensue, had no other chance for preserving Limerick, but that of leaving it in the hands of Donald, prince of Thomond, as a vassal of the Eng∣lish crown, from whom, however, he exacted hostages, and a new oath to de∣fend the place, and restore it to the king upon demand. Instead of regarding this obligation, however, Raymond had scarce passed over the bridge, when the other part of it was broken down, and the city fired in four different places. The commissioners, in consequence of Richard's death, returned to England, to make the king acquainted with the alteration of affairs. Henry appointed William Fitzaldhelm and John de Courcy procurators, or justices of Ireland, and they were accompanied by Robert Fitzstephens and Miles Cogan. Fitz∣aldhelm being the first in commission, and seneschal, Raymond, at his arrival in Wexford, surrendered to him the government, cities, forts, and garrisons of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions, Henry's attention was chiefly employed in regulating the civil policy of England. He summoned a great council at Northampton, where the constitutions of Clarendon, with regard to laymen and criminal matters, were amended and confirmed; and some of the old Saxon laws revived: further measures were taken to prevent murder, robbery, clipping and coining, and to punish incendiaries<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and harbourers of convicted criminals; it was decreed that they should lose the right hand as well as the foot; and that rustics should not escape, though acquitted by the water ordeal, but be banished the king∣dom, notwithstanding this trial, provided they were reputed guilty in the opinion of the neighbourhood. That justice might be duly administered, the realm was di∣vided into six circuits, and to each of these three justices were assigned; that they might make a yearly progress, and determine pleas of the crown and civil causes. They were upon this occasion enjoined to enquire into all disseisins, since the king's last return to England; to administer the oath of fealty to all noblemen, knights, freeholders, and husbandmen; to prosecute to an outlawry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb. Hoveden.

<P>To this council of Northampton the king of Scotland was sum∣moned, with several abbots of that kingdom, to acknowledge their subjection to the English church; but this they refused to profess, and asserted their own in∣dependence. Roger, archb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop of York, produced instances of such subjec∣tion to his see, payed of old by the bishops of Withorne and Glasgow, and bulls of divers popes, establishing and confirming the primacy of York over all the sees of Scotland: but he was warmly opposed by the archbishop of Canter∣bury, who insisted upon their being subject to his church, though he could ad∣vance no plausible argument to strengthen his claim; and Henry put an end to
<PB N="357" REF="3660"/>
the dispute, by allowing the Scottish prelates to return to their own country, without having acknowleged the primacy of either. Another quarrel was re∣vived between the two metropolitans, in their contest for precedency, which Richard claimed as the undoubted right of his church, by an antient and invariable custom; while Roger pretended to it, from the priority of his consecration, according to a constitution of Gregory the great. At a synod held in the chapel of St. Catherine, in Westmin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, by Huguezun, the pope's legate, Roger, entering the place before his rival, took possession of the seat on the cardinal's right-hand; but Richard coming, refused to sit on the left-hand. The most virulent altercation ensued, though the king was present; and the suf∣fragans of Canterbury proceeding to immediate action, Roger was pulled from his place, thrown down, trampled under foot, and treated with other indigni∣ties. Huguezun was scandalised at this violence and indecency, in consequence of which the synod immediately broke up, and, supposing the outrage to have been preconcerted by the archbishop of Canterbury and his dependants, sum∣moned him to answer for it before the pope, to whom Roger also appealed. But Richard with a sum of money appeased the legate; and the king called another council at Winchester to compromise the difference between the two prelates, who agreed to refer the dispute to the arbitration of the archbishop of Rouen, and some other foreign prelates, and to wait five years for their decision. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>Henry's ecclesiastical troubles were no sooner pacified, than his do∣mestic disgusts revived. His eldest son still retained his jealousy and aversion to his father's government; and this was fomented by the parasites, who had insinuated themselves into his confidence. He could not reside with any pleasure in Eng∣land; and therefore, on pretence of devotion, desired to make a pilgrimage to James of Compostella: the old king endeavoured to divert him from his pur∣pose; but, finding him inflexible, granted the permission he desired, and he was already at Portsmouth, waiting for a fair wind, when his brother Richard arrived from the continent, to sollicit succours for maintaining war with the ba∣rons of Guienne, who refused to part with their castles, according to Henry's orders. The king immediately sent for his eldest son to Winchester, where he persuaded him to postpone his pilgrimage, and assist his brother in the reduction of Guienne, towards which he supplied Richard with a large sum of money. The two princes set sail together; but no sooner arrived at Barfleur, than Hen∣ry and his queen repaired to the court of France, leaving the burthen of the war upon Richard's shoulders. This young prince levying a strong body of forces in Guienne, defeated the Brabantines in a pitched battle, between S. Megrin and Bouteville; then advancing into the Limousin, reduced the castle of Aixe, and the city of Limoges, and returned to Poitiers, to hold a council with his bro∣ther Henry, about the further operations of the campaign.</P>

<P>The two brothers undertook the siege of Chateauneuf, but Henry, after having stayed about a fortnight in the camp, returned to Poitiers, and took into his family and service a number of French and Norman knights, who had been the professed enemies of his father. These necessarily instigated him to renounce his duty and allegiance by another revolt; and one Adam de Cher∣chedun, his chancellor, wrote an account of their conduct to be forwarded to the king; but his letters being intercepted, young Henry would have put him to death, had not he claimed the privilege of an ecclesiastic, which was assert∣ed by the bishop of Poitiers. This, however, could not screen him from the
<PB N="358" REF="3670"/>
most painful and ignominious punishment. He was ordered to be stripped <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tark naked, with his hands tied behind him, and scourged through the streets of Poitiers: he underwent the same shameful discipline in all the towns, through which he passed in his way to Argenton, where he was kept in close prison, un∣til the king, hearing of his misfortune, sent four knights of his houshold, to bring him safe into England. Mean while Richard prosecuted the war with vigour; and after having taken divers fortresses, invested Angoulesme, which was defended by the count in person, and his son, the viscounts of Li∣moges, Ventadour, and Chabannois. The siege was carried on with such vigour, that in six days they were fain to capitulate, and surrender at discretion; and Richard sent them over to his father, who remitted them to his custody, until he himself should cross the sea into Normandy.</P>

<P>While Richard gathered laurels in the war of Guienne, the old king thought he could not employ himself better, than in taking precautions for the defence of his government, against the machinations of his eldest son, with which he was well acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted. He took into his own possession all the castles belonging to his barons, and committed them to the care of his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

He gave his daughter Eleanor in marriage to Alphonso, king of Castile, and bestowed the other, whose name was Jane, upon William, king of Sicily, to whom cardinal Huguezun had made a very advantageous report of her beauty and merit. This legate came over into England, to absolve Henry of the vow he had taken to go on a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lgrimage to the Holy Land; and he was ordered by the pope to exercise his legatine power in a visitation of the churches in England, and by insisting upon the execution of the stipulations made at Henry's absolution, after the mur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of Becket. The king had consented that no clergyman should be called to answer before a lay judge, for any crime or transgression, except those of the forest laws, and in case of lay fees which owed service to the sove∣reign or lord paramount: he had promised, that no prelacy should be kept va∣cant longer than one year; and exempted the clergy from the hardship of de∣ciding their right by duel; a privilege which he had already granted to the laity, by the institution of the grand assize. Hitherto the murderers of clergy∣men were only punished with excommunication; but now the king enacted a law, ordaining that the murderers of ecclesiast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cs should be tried in his court, before the justic ary of the realm, in presence of the bishop of the diocese or his official; and besides the usual punishment incurred by those convicted of murder∣ing laymen, forfeit for themselves and their heirs, all their real estates and lands<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to.

In return for these concessions in behalf of the clergy, the pope gave up the pretended exemption, insisted upon by Becket when he refused to plead in the king's court; and in a bull dated at Frascati, expresly declared, that all causes about estates and possessions belonged to the cognizance of the royal tribunal.</P>

<P>Huguezun having finished his visitation in England, set sail for Normancy on the same errand; and in less than a month after his departure, cardinal Vivian arrived at Dover, with the character of legate in Scotland, Ire∣land, and the neighbouring islands: he was sent over at the request of the Scottish bishops, who, in order to avoid all subjection to the church of Eng∣land, had put themselves under the pope's protect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.

Vivian, terrified at this peremptory message, took the oath accordingly, and being furnished by Henry with a pass, and letters of recommendation to the bishops and abbeys in his way, he continuedhis jo urney towards Scotland. He met the king of that country on his way to Henry's court, with Gilbert, lord of Galloway, whom he had redu∣ced, and now brought along with him, to do homage and swear fealty to the king of England. He, at the same time, paid a thousand marks of silver, either by way of present, or fine for the death of his brother; delivered his son Dun∣can as an hostage for his future behaviour, and was received into the protection of Henry, who re-established him in the possession of all his territories. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

W. de Cahaines, vass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to the earl of Leicester, who was still in disgrace, pretending to hold his barony of the king, whose favour he hoped to acquire by this pretence, the earl was brought to answer the allegations, and behaved with such modesty and sub∣mission, that Henry restored to him all the lands he had formerly possessed: at the same time, he indulged Hugh, earl of Chester, with his whole estate, except the castle; and bestowed upon William de Albiny, the earldom of Arundel or Sussex. With the pope's consent, he converted the college of secular clergy at Waltham cross, into an abbey of canons regular, and deposed the abbess of Am∣bresbury for her incontinence. He supplied Philip, count of Flanders, with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>The next measure of importance pursued by Henry, was an in∣quisition into divided fiefs, their tenures in capite and services; which was made by all the sheriffs and bailiffs of the kingdom, and the report delivered into the exchequer. He then issued orders to all the earls, barons, and knights of the realm who held of him in capite, to meet him at London, with their horses and arms, in order to be transported into Normandy, where they should serve a whole year at their own expence. In all probability, he foresaw a rupture with France; but, this not happening so soon as he expected, the rendezvous was postponed.

The king assembled all his prelates, earls, and barons at London, to examine the merits of this extraordinary appeal; and the facts being fairly stated on both sides, he awarded to each party the territories which the other had usurped; and the determination being approved by both kings, he dismissed the ambassadors with magnificent presents. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.</NOTE></P>

In one of these assemblies at Oxford, he exacted another oath of allegiance from Rese ap Griffith, and David ap Owen, princes of South and North Wales, and the principal nobility of those countries, and bestowed his natural sister Emma in marriage upon David, with the terri∣tory of Ellesmere: at the same time, he created his youngest son John lord of Ireland, and distributed among his noblemen the lands of the Irish who had lately revolted, in consequence of the depredations they suffered from the Eng∣lish.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned Abb</NOTE> Meath was given to Hugh de Lacy, the kingdom of Corke divided be∣tween Miles Cogan, and Robert Fitzstephens; and Limerick was bestowed upon Philip de Braouse: he retained, however, in his own hands, the cities of Dub∣lin, Corke, Waterford, and Wexford, the governments of which he conferred upon Robert Poer, William Fitzaldhelm, and others in whose fidelity he could confide; and he ordered Hugh Kevelcock, earl of Chester, to assist in subduing the country, where he might have an opportunity to justify by his services, the generosity of the king who had pardoned him for his rebellion, and restored him to his honours and estates.</P>

<P>By this time the mutual jealousy and disgust, subsisting between the kings of England and France, drew towards a rupture.

He had a very good pretext for postponing this alliance, because Lewis had not fulfilled his part of the agreement, in ceding the Vexin to young Henry, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb.</NOTE> city of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urges to Richard. The old king resolved to avail himself of this handle; and delaying the rendezvous of his troops by a proclamation, sent the archbishop of Rouen, with the bishops of Winchester and Ely, as his am∣bassadors to the court of France, to demand the execution of the articles; and that his daughter-in-law Margaret, who had gone thither without his know∣lege and consent, should be re-conducted to Normandy, as her pregnancy was then far advanced. To these demands no satisfactory answer was returned; and all the affairs of the kingdom being settled in an assembly at Winchester, at which William, king of Scotland, assisted, in obedience to a royal mandate, Henry repaired to Stoke, in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth, where his fleet lay ready for the embarkation of his forces. There he was detained by contrary winds, until a messenger arrived with advice from Richard Giffard, whom he employed as an agent in France, that cardinal Peter, elect of Meaux, and le∣gate in that kingdom, had received orders to lay his dominions under an inter∣dict, unless he would immediately consent to the consummation of the marriage between Richard and Alice. He returned immediately to Winchester, where he consulted his prelates and friends upon this subject; and the archbishop of Can∣terbury, with his suffragans, appealed to the pope against this intended sentence of the legate; while a messenger was dispatched to the archbishop of York, desiring he would take the same step in his province, without delay. Thus se∣cured against the bad effects of the papal censure, he embarked at Portsmouth, with his son Geoffrey, and landed next day in Normandy, from whence the young prince set out immediately for Bretagne, to quell some disturbances in that
<PB N="361" REF="3700"/>
province; while his father repaired to Rouen, where he was visited by cardinal Peter. This prelate, having signified the orders of his holiness, proposed an in∣terview between Henry and the French king, who met accordingly at Gué S. Renu, near Nonancourt, where the king of England offered to complete the marriage between Richard and Alice, provided Lewis would cede Bourges to that young prince, and put his eldest son in possession of the country lying be∣tween Gilors and Pontoise, according to the stipulations of the last treaty. The French king refusing to perform these articles, the difference could not be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.

<P>This temporary accommodation being effected, Henry returned to Vernueil, where, in a general council, he enacted an ordinance, exempting the effects of vassals from being seized for the debts of their lords, unless they engaged as sureties, and ordering their rents to be paid to the creditors, in lieu of that distress: a law which in some measure ascertained the liberty of the com∣mons; and which was published in the form of a charter through all his domi∣nions, at home and abroad. He had sent his eldest son to suppress an infur∣rection<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

Then he rescued a rich heiress, the daughter of Ralf de Deols, who had been carried off by the lord of La Chastre, and quelled an insurrection in the Li∣mousin. Thence he repaired to Greissac, in Auvergne, when, in the presence of the French king, the assembled states of that province declared, that their country belonged of ancient right to the counts of Guienne, except the bishop∣ric of Clermont, which was under the patronage of France. Lewis dissenting from this verdict, the dispute was left to the arbitration of twelve referees; and in the mean time, Henry took possession of the castle of Turenne, and received homage and allegiance from the barons and knights of La Marche, which he purchased for six thousand marks of silver, of count Audibert, who had engaged in an expedition to the Holy Land. His next care was to provide for the security of his Norman frontiers, towards which he procured letters of protection from the French king, according to the practice of those times, in which mutual assist∣ance of this kind was never refused by princes who had taken the cross to∣gether. <NOTE PLACE="marg">R. de Monte.</NOTE></P>

<P>At his return to England he knighted his son Geoffrey, with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Young Henry was so fond of such atchievements, that they engrossed his whole attention for three years, during which he consorted with knights only, and courted po∣pularity, at a prodigous expence. Richard was more honourably engaged in opposing the ravages of the banditti, composed of Basques, Navarrois, and other mounta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eers inhabiting the Pyrenees, who infested Guienne, and occa∣sionally joined the barons when they revolted.

He staid but a few days, after having performed his acts of duty, and, at his return, found his son recovering; though he himself was, in his way to St. Denis, seized with an apoplectic fit, which produced a palsy, that hindered him from assisting at Philip's coronation.

She had recourse to young Henry, who then resided in Normandy; and he prevailed upon his father to espouse her quarrel. With this view, the king repaired to his Norman dominions, where he was visited by the queen of France, her brothers the counts of Blois, Chartres, and Sancerre, who promised to be ruled by his counsels, and gave hostages for the performance of that promise; in consequence of which Henry raised a nu∣merous army to support their pretensions. Mean while Philip married Isabel, daughter of Baldwin, count of Hainault, and niece to his governor the count of Flanders; and this princess being crowned at St. Denis, her husband advan∣ced with an army towards the frontiers of Normandy. The king of England, at<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

At this conference, the count of Flanders did homage to the king of England, on the renewal of a former convention, by which he received from Henry, a pension of a thousand pounds, in consideration of his furnishing five hundred knights to serve the king forty days, whenever required.

<P>During Henry's residence at Le Mans, he ordered the officers of the English mint to be prosecuted and severely fined for adulterating the coin, which was new cast, of a different form and true standard: and Ralf de Glan∣ville, chief justiciary of the kingdom, published some of the confessor's laws, or∣daining that the tenants of the church should be sued only in the ecclesiastical court; that churches and parsonage houses should be held as sanctuaries; though, in cases of rapine, the offenders should either make restitution or abjure the country; that wives, innocent of the crimes committed by their husbands, should not forfeit their dower; nor children be deprived of their inheritance for any crime perpetrated by their father, before they were born or begotten. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

Stephen, count of Sancerre, one of Phi∣lip's uncles, took possession of some lands which he retained by force, in con∣tempt of the king's orders, and did homage to the count of Fland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs for the castle of St. Brue, that he might have a title to his protection. Accordingly, when the king expelled his uncle and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used to restore the estate, the count in∣vaded the territories of the count de Clermont, and engaged a number of the French nobility in his faction: he likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollicited the emperor of Germany to make an irruption into the territories of France. Young Henry raised an army to assist his brother-in-law, and the old king resolved to make another voyage to the continent, in order to adjust the difference. But before his departure, he made a will, in which he bequeathed twenty thousand marks for the defence of the Holy Land; and the christians of Palestine being distressed by the arms of Saladin, Sultan of Egypt, he sent immediately five hundred marks of gold, and two and forty thousand of silver for their relief.

of embarking in the crusade, hoping his father, out of his paternal tendernefs, would grant all he asked to divert him from this resolution: but being disap∣pointed in this scheme, he agreed to take an hundred and ten livres a day for his subsistence; and the king promised to pay a year's appointments to an hun∣dred knights of his houshold. Thus satisfied, he and his brothers accompanied their father to Angers, were they swore to maintain perpetual amity with one another; and Geoffrey, having now obtained possession of Brittany by his mar∣riage with Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, did homagé to his elder brother for that dutchy: but when the father proposed the like submisson for Guienne, Richard at first re∣fused to comply with his desire: he was at length, however, prevailed upon to offer homage to young Henry, by whom it was rejected with disdain. High words ensued, and this was the beginning of a quarrel, in consequence of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1183.</NOTE> Richard retired to his province and fortified his castles. As he had ruled with great severity, and debauched the wives and daughters of his barons, they now engaged in a conspiracy against him, and offered their allegiance to Henry, who countenanced their revolt, and, in conjunction with his brother Geoffrey, resolved to drive Richard out of Guienne. With this view, Henry invested it on one side, and Geoffrey on the other, while the barons appeared in open re∣bellion. In this emergency, Richard had recourse to his father, who forthwith raised a numerous army, and marched to his assistance. He entered the town of Limoges, though the castle was in the hands of his eldest son, who, finding it would be impracticable to cope with his father in the field, pretended to submit and reconcile the barons of Guienne with his brother Richard: under pretence of effecting this accommodation, he and Geoffrey held private conferences with tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e revolters, in which they concerted measures for the king's destruction. He was so little apprehensive of their design, that he had dismissed the greatest part of his forces; and while he staid at Limoges in full security, the soldiers in the castle tutored for the purpose, sent a flight of arrows against him, one day while he took the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r on horseback, suspecting no danger.

But, before he could execute his resolution, he was taken ill of a fever at Martel, a castle in Turenne, and apprehending that his life was near a period, earnestly desired to speak with his father. The king, suspecting some treachery<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent a bishop, who found him in extremity, and received his dying request, that his father would forgive all his offences and ingratitude; pay the wages due to his knights and attendants, and deal mercifully with the barons of Guienne. In a few hours af∣ter this communication, he died a penitent; after having exhibited repeated proofs of an ungrateful and unnatural disposition towards an indulgent parent, against whose life he had resolved to draw his sword in battle, on the Monday after he sickened. The king's affection glowed even to a vicious extreme; for, when he was informed of his son's death, he fainted away in three successive

swoons, and poured forth such lamentations as the loss of such an undutiful child could by no means justify. He had more reason to rejoice at his decease, by which a dangerous conspiracy was dissolved: the rebellious troops immediately dispersed, and were pursued by Richard; the castle of Limoges was taken; the nobles of Guienne submitted, surrendering their fortresses, which were razed to the ground; and the peace of the province was re-esta∣blished before the arrival of the king of Arragon, who had marched with an ar∣my<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul.

Henry alledged, that the settlement was void, as assigning lands which belonged to queen Eleanor, whom he now released; and he claimed Gisors as an appendage of Normandy. This dispute produced a long negociation, which at length ended in an accommodation at Gisors, where both kings agreed, that Margaret should relinquish her claim to the dower, in consideration of an annuity amounting to two thousand seven hundred livres; and that Gisors should be given to either of Henry's sons, as the portion of Adelais or Alice, who had been designed for Richard, and educated at Win∣chester. After this accommodation, Henry returned to England, where he was visited by William, king of Scotland, who demanded in marriage Maud, the daughter of the duke of Saxony; and the proposal was accepted, though the marriage did not take place, because the parties were related within the prohi∣bited degrees of consanguinity, and the pope's dispensation could not be ob∣tained. Rese ap Griffith, who had stain Ralf Poer, in revenge for some inju∣ries he had received from that nobleman, and made several incursions upon the English territories, appeared at the king's court in Worcester; excused what he had done, as the effect of the most provoking wrongs; restored the castles he had taken in the king's absence, renewed his oath of fealty, and promised to send his son and nephews, as hostages for his good behaviour.</P>

<P>At the death of young Henry, Richard succeeding as heir appa∣rent to the throne, was desired by his father to resign Guienne to his youngest brother John, who had been brought to Normandy for this purpose; but Rich∣ard desiring time to consult his friends, withdrew privately into his province, from whence he wrote a letter to his father, refusing to part with his possession. When the king returned to England, Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rey and John invaded Guienne, ravag∣ing the country as they proceeded; and Richard, in revenge, made incursions into Brittany: till at length their father commanded them to suspend their hostili∣ties, and come over to England, when they were reconciled, and Richard sub∣mitted to his determination. About this period the archbishop of Cologne ar∣riving in this kingdom, on a pilgrimage to Becket's tomb, proposed a match between Richard and the emperor's daughter, which was actually settled, tho' rendered afterwards ineffectual by the death of that princess; and Henry seized this opportunity of compromising the difference between his son-in-law the duke of Saxony, and this prelate, who not only forgave him for the injuries he had received at his hands, but also undertook to be his advocate with Fre∣derick; at the same time he engaged in his behalf pope Lucius, whom he had

occasion to oblige in a very singular manner. That pontiff, having been expelled from Rome by an insurrection of the people, made application to the different princes and churches in Europe for succour in his distress, and Henry had sup∣plied him with a large sum of money; so that he readily used his good offices, in favour of the Saxon, with the emperor, who next year recalled and restored him to the possession of great part of his territories. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>The next affair that engaged the king's attention, was the va∣cancy of the metropolitan see, by the death of archbishop Richard. Ralf de Glanville, the chief justiciary, and some bishops, were sent to prepare the convent for an election; and the monks pitched upon the abbot of Battel, and four other ecclesiastics, who were rejected by the king, at a council held at Reading. A dispute ensued, between the delegates of the convent and the suf∣fragan bishops, about the right of electing, and divers councils were convened before the matter could be brought to a determination. At length the bishops chose Baldwin, of Worcester, who was confirmed by the king; but, as the monks retired without giving their assent, Henry went in person to Canterbury, and persuaded them to acquiesce in the choice, after they had been indulged with the formality of another election. In consequence of this permission, the delegates assembling in the chapter-house at Westminster, chose Baldwin, sang Te Deum, led him to the altar, saluted him on the cheek, and presented him to the king and his sons, who repeated the salutation of the kiss, which he had received at his first election. Hitherto the forest laws had been very much neg∣lected, through the indulgence of the king; but the subject abused his lenity to such a degree, that in each department of the kingdom, he appointed two gen∣tlemen of his houshold, as verdurers, with full authority over all his foresters, and those belonging to his knights and barons. There was a new assize of the forest, established, cautioning all persons against transgressing the forest laws of Henry I. which he was determined thenceforward to put in execution; though he allowed his earls, barons, and free tenants, to cut wood for their own use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Henry, while at peace with his neighbours, was generally employed in measures for the advantage of his subjects, or of his own family; and no prince was more ungratefully treated by both. His youngest son John, having now attained the age of manhood, was knighted by him at Windsor, in order to be sent into Ireland, that he might make an entire conquest, and enjoy the crown of that kingdom. The Irish affairs had been hitherto left chiefly to the ma∣nagement of private adventurers, who, being disunited among themselves, had not made such progress as he expected from their valour: they seemed to aim rather at independent settlements, than at a national advantage. There was a sort of jealousy between the king's officers and the private proprietors of the con∣quered lands, which much retarded the conquest of the country; for their mutual jars and indifference towards one another, occasioned a relaxation of discipline, and a want of that punctual exertion of authority, which was necessary to repress the inconstant disposition of the Irish. William Fitz-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dhelm, appointed lord justice, had employed himself in nothing but schemes for curtailing the possessions of private adventurers, for his own ad∣vantage: Miles Cogan, governor of Dublin, had made a short expedition into Connaught, but was obliged to retreat with precipitation, after having lost se∣veral
<PB N="368" REF="3770"/>
men in an ambuscade near the Shannon. Philip de Braouse remained in∣active in Limerick: Robert Fitzstephens and Miles Cogan planted seven can∣treds near the city of Corke; and left the other twenty-four in possession of Der∣mot Maccarty, prince of Desmond: but a quarrel happening on account of the death of Miles, and Ralf the son of Robert, who were treacherously mur∣dered by Mactyre, Dermot assembled an army, and invested Corke, which was bravely defended by Robert, until his nephew Raimund arrived with some troops from Wales, and raised the siege. This reinforcement, and another, under the command of Philip Barry and Richard, brother to Miles Cogan, enabled Robert to defeat the Irish in several encounters, until that part of the country was reduced to obedience. Hugh de Lacy settled colonies throughout the whole country of Meath, and bui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a number of castles for their protection: he restored those who had been violently ejected from their possessions, and governed with such equity and resolution, that the people became happy under his administra∣tion; and, laying aside their barbaro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s customs, began to live together in towns and villages. He succeeded Fitz-aldhelm, who was reca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, as sole guardian of the kingdom, and settled Leinster, as he had before cultivated Meath; en∣couraging the arts of peace, and conciliating the affection of the Irish by his ge∣nerosity, affability, and equ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table government. At length he became extremely popular, and marrying the daughter of Roderic O Connor, king of Connaught, king Henry was so alarmed at the alliance, that he sent over John, constable of Chester, and Richard de Pec, to assume the administration, and keep a watch∣ful eye over Hugh's conduct: but perceiving he had nothing in view but the public good, they returned to England, and made such favourable report of his integrity, that he was re-established in the government, and Robert de Shrewsbury joined with him in the commission. During these transactions, no attempt was made to extend the English conquest, but by John de Courcy, a nobleman of gigantic stature, great strength, and the most enterprising courage, to whom Henry had granted a patent for all the lands he should conquer in the unsubdued parts of Ireland, joining him at the same time with Fitz aldhelm in the government. John, leaving the civil power with his colleague, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan his march into the province of Ulster, with two and twenty knights and follow∣ers, and three hundred private soldiers. On the fourth day of his march he ar∣rived at Downe, in which resided king Dunleve, who f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d at his approach, so that he took the town without resistance. The legate Viv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, who at that time held a council in the town, endeavoured to mediate a peace between John and Dunleve, which last promised to pay a trib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, if the other would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ave the country; but his proposal being rejected, he resolved to hazard a battle, and, assembling a body of ten thousand men, advanced to Downe, where De Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lay encamped. The engagement was bloody and severe, and the victory conti∣nued long doubtful: but at length the half naked Irish, yielding to the arms and superior discip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine of the English, were utterly defeated. Nevert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eless they afterwards returned with a stronger army, and were routed in ano∣ther battle; after which the victor erected two castles, for the security of his conquest, at Ferney, in the county of Monag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an. These he committed to the care of Macmahon, the chieftain of a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt who had submitted and sworn fidelity; and Courcy's back was no sooner turned, than he levelled them with the ground. John, incensed at this instance of perfidy, ravaged
<PB N="369" REF="3780"/>
his territories, and drove away his cattle, to an incredible number, in three di∣visions, taking up as many miles in length. In passing thro' deep roads, surround∣ed with bogs and woods, the Irish, who had concealed themselves in ambush, rushed suddenly from the bushes, with such hideous shouts as affrighted the cattle, which turned upon their drivers, and occasioned universal disorder among the English, who were dispersed and mostly cut in pieces. John de Courcy himself was obliged, with a few followers, to fight his way with incredible va∣lour for two days together, until he reached a fort, which served as a rendez∣vous for his scattered party. This was immediately invested by the enemy, who elated with their success, encamped in a careless manner, without watches, guards, or patroles; and John, apprized of their rash security, sallied upon them in the night, when they were half asleep; so that making no resistance, such a carnage ensued, that not above two hundred of their whole number escaped. They ventured two other battles, and were defeated in both, first at Dundalk, and afterwards near the bridge of Ivory: then John married the daughter of Go∣thred, king of Man and the isles; and this alliance depriving the enemy of all hope of succour from that quarter, he, in a little time, completed the conquest of Ulster. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hibern.

<P>King Henry hoping the presence of his son John would unite the Eng∣lish interest, and hasten the reduction of the country, supplied him with four hundred knights, twice the number of horsemen, and a strong body of archers, with whom he began his march to Milford-haven, and there embarking arrived next day at Waterford. Immediately after his landing, he was visited by the most considerable of the Irish nobility residing in those parts, who had lived peaceably under the English government; but, instead of being graciously re∣ceived, they met with the most indecent insults and derision from his giddy fa∣vourites, who laughed at their habit and address, shook them by their long beards, and committed other such outrages, that the natives, who were remark∣ably proud and impatient, retired in the utmost indignation to their own homes, from whence they removed their families and cattle into the territories of Lime∣rick, Corke, and Connaught. The report they made of the insolence with which they had been treated, by the stripling prince and his Norman compa∣nions, had such an effect upon the princes of these dominions, that although they had resolved to submit, they now renounced all thoughts of subjection to the English government. Instead of going to offer their services and submission to John, the petty princes hitherto at variance engaged in a league for their common defence, and the refugees served them as spies and guides to the Eng∣lish quarters, into which they made repeated incursions. At the arrival of the first adventurers, the Irish had no defensive armour, and used no other wea∣pons than short lances, slender darts, and hatchets, managed with one hand: so that they could not stand the shock of heavy armed troops, under∣stood nothing of horse service, and dreaded the arrows, which wounded their na∣ked bodies at a distance. But, by this time, they had profited by their expe∣rience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1185.</NOTE> they had procured some defensive armour and long spears, and cautiously avoiding a pitched battle, formed ambushes in woods and morasses, from whence they sallied out upon detached parties, encumbered by that very equipage which rendered them so formidable in the open plain. The first adventurers were

hardy Welshmen, bred up in woods, bogs, and mountains, and inured to danger and fatigue; but as these were slighted by the young prince, all the mili∣tary expeditions were undertaken by the Normans, who though addicted to lux∣ury and averse to labour, were instigated to action by avarice, and in a little time greatly diminished by those slight skirmishes, in which the enemy always obtained the advantage.

The king, being informed of these circum∣stances, recalled John and his youthful counsellors, and left the management of affairs to John de Courcy, who, keeping his troops in continual action, attacked the enemy in all quarters, and scouring the countries of Corke, Limerick, and Connaught, in a little time compelled them to be quiet.</P>

<P>Immediately before John set out on his Irish expedition, Heraclius, pa∣triarch of Jerusalem, and the great master of the Knights-hospitallers, arrived in England, with letters from pope Lucius, solliciting Henry to go in person to the relief of the Holy Land, which was almost intirely reduced by Saladine. Baldwin IV. who sat upon the throne of Jerusalem, was disabled from acting by an inveterate leprosy; his son was a minor, and a competition between Guy de Lusignan, and Raimund, count of Tripoli, for the management of affairs, had well nigh excited a civil war among the christians. Nothing could prevent the impending ruin of the kingdom of Jerusalem, but the arrival of some power∣ful European prince; and in this emergency, Baldwin turned his eyes upon Henry, to whom he was nearly related. He had begun a progress to the north, when the ambassadors arrived; but no sooner heard of their landing, than he returned to Reading, where he gave them audience, receiving from the patri∣arch the keys of the holy sepulchre, and the royal banner of Jerusalem, which he redelivered to Heraclius, to be kept until he should have consulted the pre∣lates<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and nobility of his kingdom. He accordingly convoked a great council at Clerkenwell, in which the king of Scotland and his barons assisted, and sub∣mitted the patriarch's proposal to their consideration, when, after having duly de∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berated on the subject, they were unanimous in their opinion, that the king, in accepting the crown of Jerusalem, and engaging in an expedition to Palestine, would hazard the safety of his own kingdom. The ambassadors thus disap∣pointed of the father, desired that he would at least send one of his sons to their re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief; and John, throwing himself at the king's feet, earnestly begged he might be employed in that service. But Henry's affection for his children witheld his consent; and indeed he had already projected that prince's armament for the conquest of Ireland. He therefore offered a large some of money for present succour to the chr stian crusades, but deferred taking any other resolution, with regard to that affair, until he should have consulted with the king of France; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r which purpose, Henry set out with the patriarch for Normandy; and the two kings conferring upon the subject at Vaudreuil, agreed to send large supplies of men and money, but neither would go in person.</P>

<P>It would have been a very rash undertaking in Henry, and altogether inconsistent with his usual prudence, to embark personally in such an expedition,
<PB N="371" REF="3800"/>
while his family was divided by dissentions, which, in his absence, would have made his dominions scenes of blood and desolation. Richard had, in the be∣ginning of the year, left England and returned to Guienne, where, forgetting the oath he had lately taken, he fortified his castles, and invaded his brother's territories of Bretagne; so that Henry was now obliged to levy an army to reduce him to obedience: though, in order to prevent the effusion of blood, he had re∣course to an expedient which answered his expectation. We have already ob∣served, that queen Eleanor had been set at liberty; and the king kept a court at Windsor, for her and her daughter the dutchess of Saxony. She was now brought over into Normandy, and Richard ordered to surrender the whole county of Guienne as her inheritance, otherwise he should be compelled to do<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The prince, though rough, violent, and headstrong, loved his mother with the most warm affection, and the subjects of Guienne, respecting her as the heiress of their antient princes, he ceded the whole country with all the fortresses to her officers, and submitting to his father, took up his residence at the English court, where he conducted himself with such seeming duty and moderation, that Henry resolved to trust him again with the manage∣ment of that province. Raimund, count of Tholouse, had imprisoned several merchants of Guienne, and Richard was sent to take satisfaction for the injury: he forthwith raised an army, and wasted the territories of the count, who in vain sollicited the king of France for assistance. Philip's hands were tied up by a treaty which he had lately concluded with the king of England. The annuity of his sister Margaret was confirmed, together with the contract of marriage be∣tween Richard and Adelais, and Philip renounced all claim to Gisors and its de∣pendencies. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved.

<P>Henry, having thus secured the peace of his foreign dominions, re∣turned to England, where, in a council held at Oxford, he proposed to William, king of Scotland, that, as he could not marry Maud daughter of the Saxon, on account of consanguinity, he would espouse Ermengarde, grand-daughter of Roscelin, viscount of Beaumont le Roger, and Constance the natural daughter of Henry I. king of England. The proposal was embraced by William, who, while ambassadors were sent for the lady, returned to his own country, in order to reduce Roland, the son of Uchtred, who, at the death of his uncle Gilbert, had seized the succession of Galloway, to the prejudice of Gilbert's son Duncan, who resided at the English court as an hostage, under the protection of king Henry. This monarch no sooner received intimation of his having usurped his cousin's dominions, and slaughtered all the barons who presumed to oppose his invasion, than he advanced, at the head of a numerous army, to Carlisle, where he was visited by Roland in person, who submitted and swore fealty, on condition of being allowed to possess his paternal estate, and promised to stand to the award of the king's court, with regard to his claim to the dominions of Gilbert. The Scottish king, and his brother David, with the principal nobility of that kingdom, obliged themselves by oath to make war on Roland, should he renounce the fealty he had sworn; and the bishop of Glasgow engaged to subject him to the sentence of excommunication. William's marriage was afterwards solemnized at Wodestoke; upon which occasion, Henry gave a rent of an hundred marks, with forty knights-fees, as a portion to Ermengarde, and, at the same time,
<PB N="372" REF="3810"/>
delivered up the castle of Edinburgh, which he had hitherto kept in his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Mailro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> hands since the treaty of York.</P>

<P>Before the celebration of this marriage, the king of England was de∣prived of his son Geoffrey; a prince of equal pride, dissimulation, and perfidy, who had been deeply engaged in all the unnatural schemes of rebellion which had broke out in the course of his father's reign. He had lately demanded the county of Anjou, and met with a denial, because Richard would not consent to the alienation of that province. Exasperated at the refusal, he retired to the court of France, and agreed to hold Brittany in vassalage of Philip, and shake off all subjection to his father, provided the French monarch would assist him with an army to invade Normandy. But the execution of his perfidious design was anticipated by death: he was unhorsed in a tournament, and bruised in such a manner that he fell ill of a fever and died in a few days, very little regretted by his father's good subjects, among whom he was generally distinguished by the appellation of "the child of perdition," on account of his undutiful disposition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eto Col.

The French king, therefore, threatened to invade the pro∣vince, in case his demand should be rejected; and the English king sent am∣bassadors to terminate the affair in an amicable manner; so that both parties agreed to a truce, which was afterwards prolonged. At the same time, a disturbance was raised in Brittany, by Guiomar de Leon and his brother; but the dutchess Constance being delivered of a posthumous son, who was called Arthur, the Bre∣tons were so pleased with this event, that the rebellion immediately subsided.</P>

<P>A conference being opened at Gué St. Remi, between the kings of France and England, in which cardinal Octavian and Hugh Nonant, the pope's legates, acted as mediators for the establishment of a solid peace, Philip's de∣mands were so unreasonable, that the negociation broke off, and both princes prepared for hostilities. Henry levying a numerous army, divided it into four bodies, commanded by the princes Richard and John, the earl of Albemarle, and his natural son Geoffrey; and these divisions were detached to defend the dif∣ferent quarters of his dominions. The French king had recourse to the arts of perfidy, and tampered with Urse de Fretteval and the count de Nevers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Thus encouraged, that monarch invaded Berry, and laid siege to Chateauroux, and the princes Richard and John marched immediately to the relief of the place. The two armies were in sight of each other, and actually ranged in order of battle, when the legates denounced anathemas against him who should first begin the engagement; and by their mediation, supported by the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms, a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> truce for two years was concluded.</P>

<P>Immediately after this agreement, Richard accompanied the king of France to Paris, where he was caressed in such an extraordinary manner, and such an intimacy ensued between him and Philip, that Henry took the alarm, and suspected something was hatching to his prejudice. In these sentiments, he
<PB N="373" REF="3820"/>
sent several successive messengers to recall Richard, whom he promised to gratify with every thing he could demand in reason; but, instead of complying with the king's request, he went and seized his treasure at Chinon, and thence repair∣ing to Guienne, fortified his castles and set his father at defiance, unless he would forthwith consent to his coronation. Henry had suffered too much by the ex∣periment of that sort which he tried in favour of his eldest son, to repeat it in be∣half of the proud imperious Richard, who seemed so strongly connected with his inveterate foe: he therefore rejected the proposal, and made such remonstrances to his son upon the evil consequences of his attachment to Philip, and his own undutiful behaviour, that he seemed sensible of his errors, submitted and did homage to his father, and promised upon oath, that he would never deviate from his allegiance: yet, in a very little time after this reconciliation, he re∣ceived the cross from the archbishop of Tours, without the king's consent or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.</NOTE> knowledge.</P>

<P>Henry passed the Christmas at Caen, and had already proceeded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In consequence of this information, he proposed another conference, which was held as usual between Gisors and Trie, under a vast elm that shaded several acres of ground. At this interview between the two kings, attended by Richard, the prelates and nobility of both nations, the archbishop of Tyre pronounced such a melancholy account of Saladine's success in the Holy Land, and the miseries of the christians in that country, that the whole audience was affected with the relation, and the two kings laying aside their animosity, agreed to convert their whole attention to the relief of those adventurers. They received the cross from the hands of the archbishop, resolving to go thither in person; and their example was followed by Philip, count of Flanders, and a great numher of the prelates and nobility then present. A plenary indulgence was published in the pope's name, for all that would make a fair confession of their sins, and engage in the crusade. The different nations assumed crosses of dif∣ferent colour; rules were established for preventing riot, luxury, and disorder; the two monarchs resolved to levy great armies for the occasion; and, in order to defray the expence of the expedition, imposed a tax of a tenth upon all rents and chattles belonging to the clergy as well as the laity, an imposition known by the name of the Saladine Tythe, which Henry gave immediate orders for levy∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved</NOTE> throughout his dominions on the continent.</P>

<HEAD>§ LIX.</HEAD>
<P>With a view to raise the same tax in England, and make the ne∣cessary preparations for his crusade, he took shipping at Dieppe, and landing at Winchelsea, summoned a general council at Gedington, where it was resolved to levy a tenth of all rents and moveables belonging to Jews as well as Christians; though every person, whether ecclesiastic or laic, that engaged in the crusade, was exempted from the tax, and even permitted to mortgage his estate. Hugh, bishop of Durham, and some other noblemen, were sent to desire William, king of Scotland, would subject his kingdom to the same imposition, and he seemed very well inclined to the expedient; but his prelates, earls, barons, and free tenants, being convened to deliberate on the subject, absolutely refused to saddle

<P>While Henry was thus employed in taking measures for the relief of Palestine, his good brother Philip, king of France, who had sworn to suspend all hostilities with the king of England, and to protect his territories until the crusade should be finished, disregarding this solemn obligation, began to tamper with the barons of Berry, a good number of whom he debauched from their al∣legiance: Richard, who seems to have acted in concert with him, pretended to quarrel with the count de Tholouse, and made an incursion into his country, in order to afford a pretence to Philip, who being sollicited to assist the count, in∣vaded Berry, and was received without opposition, into the most important towns and fortresses of that dutchy. He made himself master of the greatest part<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e o Col.</NOTE> of Auvergne in the same manner, and then entering Touraine, extended his conquests with surprising rapidity. Henry, alarmed at this breach of stipulations, sent Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, with the bishops of Lincoln and Ches∣ter, as ambassadors to the court of France, to complain of those hostilities, and demand restitution of the places he had taken.</P>

<P>Philip added insult to injustice, and refused an audience to those pre∣lates; so that Henry was obliged to arm in his own defence. Having assembled a strong body of English, reinforced with several thousands of Welsh infantry, he transported them, without delay, into Normandy, where they were joined by the troops of that dutchy: but before he would commence hostilities, he dispatch∣ed the archbishop of Rouen to Paris, with another demand of restitution, or in case of a refusal to renounce all fealty to Philip, in Henry's name, and to de∣clare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. Abb.</NOTE> that the king of England would, for the future, look upon him as his mortal enemy. To this message Philip answered, that he was determined to prosecute the war, until he should have reduced Berry and the Vexin Nor∣mand; and Henry, seeing no prospect of a peace, began his march towards the French territories. Having burned S. Clair sur Epte and some other towns, he adva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced to Mante, where he understood the French army was encamped; but, Philip avoiding a battle, he marched to Ivry, from whence he sent out detachments to ravage the French frontiers; and Danville with Dreux, and seve∣ral other places, were reduced to ashes. The French king, finding himself un∣able to cope with such an adversary, was fain to sue for peace, and offered of his own accord to restore all the places he had taken in Berry. A conference was immediately opened, and continued three days, during which Philip, in all pro∣babillity, took <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrage at the nature of the debates; for the negociation did not succeed; and the king of France wreaked his resentment on the spread∣ing elm, which, being within his territories, he ordered to be cut down, be∣cause Henry delighted in sitting under it's shade. The counts of Flanders and Blois, with several noblemen of France, disgusted at the pride, obstinacy, and unreasonable demands of Philip, laid down their arms, declaring they would never use them against Christians, until they should have returned from Jerusa∣lem; and the French monarch, thus weakened, desired another conference, in order to make a parade of his pacific disposition. This too proved ineffectual, from his insolent demand of the castle of Pacey, as a security for Henry's per∣forming the other articles to which they agreed; a proposal, which very ill be∣came

<P>Though the conference did not produce an immediate accommo∣dation, the parties still negociated by deputies, with such a prospect of success, that Henry sent back his Welch troops, and disbanded the mercenaries, and another interview was appointed at Bon-Moulins, for putting the finishing stroke to the treaty. At this meeting Henry proposed, that instead of protracting a troublesome dispute, they should restore what had been seized on both sides since they took the cross, and conclude at once a solid and equitable peace. This proposition was warmly opposed by Richard, who refused to part with his conquests; and Philip, though he offered to give up the places he had taken, insisted upon his sister's being immediately married to Richard; and required that all the subjects of England, Normandy, and Henry's other dominions, should take the oath of allegiance to that young prince. The king of Eng∣land replied, that the marriage should be immediately consummated, provided Philip would cede Bourges, and perform all the articles of the contract; but, the other demand he absolutely rejected, as an insult upon his authority. Rich∣ard, hearing this refusal, was transported with fury and indignation, and throw∣ing himself at Philip's feet, did instant homage for Normandy, and all the other provinces holding of France, of which he now received the investiture. While Henry sat motionless and confounded at this extraordinary scene, Philip and his new vassal retired, to the amazement of the spectators, who now plainly perceived, that this was a preconcerted scheme between the French king and Richard.</P>

<P>His father soon recollected himself from his confusion; and, in or∣der to prevent the designs of his enemies, marched immediately into Guienne, after having dispatched his chancellor Geoffrey to secure the castles of Anjou against the attempts of the confederates. Cardinal Albano, sent by pope Cle∣ment III. as his legate, to consolidate a peace between the two crowns, excom∣municated Richard, as the chief obstacle to the treaty: and this prelate dying, the pope, uneasy at the delay of the expedition to Palestine, invested the cardinal of Anagni with the legatine power, as well as with instructions to effect a reconciliation between the two monarchs. This new prelate ar∣riving in France, prevailed upon both parties to refer their disputes to the arbitration of him and the archbishop of Rheims, Bourges, Rouen, and Canterbury; and this last was, in the mean time, sent to reclaim Richard with gentle remonstrances. But all his endeavours proved ineffectual: he had been infected with jealousies by his patron of France, and believed, or pretend∣ed to believe, his father designed to disinherit him in favour of his younger bro∣ther. Possessed of this idle conceit, which had no foundation, and confident of his own merit, he rejected all overtures towards a reconciliation, and employ∣ed all his interest in raising up enemies against his father. He debauched from their allegiance, many noblemen of Normandy, Anjou, and Guienne, who took this opportunity of worshipping the rising sun. The turbulent barons of Brittany, who had been concerned in every rebellion against Henry, now de∣clared for Richard, who derived great advantage from a dangerous distemper that seized the king, already broken with infirmities and vexation.

<P>At the expiration of the truce which had been agreed upon in the beginning of the last conference, this conspiracy manifested itself in action, and Richard made some incursions into his father's territories; but these were interrupted by a renewal of the truce, at the instance of the mediators; and Henry derived great hopes of a lasting peace, from the abilities and good-will of the legate. By his interposition another conference was held at La Ferté Ber∣nard, where Philip not only repeated his former demands, but added another condition, namely, that prince John should accompany his brother to the Holy Land, an expedition from which the father was excused on account of his age and infirmities. His pretence for making this proposal was, that John might not take the advantage of Richard's absence to mount the throne at his father's de∣cease: but Philip's real motive for making this unreasonable demand, seems to have been a desire of obstructing the peace, and widening the breach between Henry and his heir, whose jealousy was confirmed by his father's rejecting the proposition. The king of England observed, that Richard had taken the cross without his knowledge; and that if his son had been guilty of an indiscreet ac∣tion, it was no reason that he should commit a greater, in exposing his domini∣ons to the ambition of a foreign invader, in case he himself should die, during the absence of both his children. The legate, who could not help assenting to the justice of his plea, exerted all his eloquence towards a pacification: but finding the French king inflexible, he threatened to lay an interdict upon his do∣minions. Philip heard him with silent scorn; but the furious Richard unsheath∣ing his sword, would have sacrificed the cardinal on the spot, had not the other members of the assembly interposed; and prevented him from executing his frantic purpose. Henry, dubious of the event of this conference, had sent Ralf de Glanville to England, to fetch over all his knights, in whose loyalty he could confide, amidst the defection of his Norman subjects, who dropped away daily at the prospect of his distress: but his enemies did not allow him time to avail himself of this reinforcement.</P>

<P>Immediately after the conference, Philip and Richard retired to No∣gent de Rotrou, where their army was cantoned. There assembling their troops, they advanced with great expedition, and reduced La Ferté Bernard, Monfort, Malestable, Beaumont, and Balon. Then taking the route to Tours, wheeled about unexpectedly, and marched directly to Mans, where Henry was quartered with seven hundred knights, and a small body of forces. Their sudden appear∣ance threw his followers into such confusion, that Stephen de Tours, seneschal of Anjou, setting the suburbs on fire, the flames were allowed to spread over the walls, and occasion a conflagration in the city. Geoffrey de Bruilon endea∣vouring to stop the progress of the enemy, by breaking down a stone bridge built over the Sarte, was attacked, wounded, and taken prisoner; and his men flying in disorder, were pursued by the French to the city, which they entered along with them pell-mell. Henry, seeing it impracticable to rectify the disor∣der
<PB N="377" REF="3860"/>
occasioned by the fire and the enemy, retired with his troops towards Fre∣nelles, leaving thirty knights and twice that number of soldiers in the tower of Le Mans, which, after having been battered three days, was obliged to sur∣render. The king dispatched William Fitz-Ralf, seneschal of Normandy, with William Mandeville, earl of Essex, and Aumale, to defend that province; and ordered his chancellor Geoffrey to march with the bulk of his army to Alençon; while he himself repaired with a small train to Angers, and was in a little time joined by a reinforcement of knights at Savigny. Philip and Rich∣ard, mean while, met with no opposition. A number of towns and castles sub∣mitted at the first summons; till at length fording the river Loire, they invest∣ed the city of Tours, which they took by scalade, while the inhabitants locked themselves up in their houses, not dreaming of resistance.</P>

<P>Conferences had still been carried on at Azay, by the legate, pre∣lates, and nobility of both kingdoms; and the count of Flanders, with the duke of Burgundy, and the archbishop of Rheims arrived at Tours with the articles of peace, which had been settled. These being qualified by Philip, were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1189.</NOTE> by the same ambassadors carried to Saumur, for the approbation of Henry, who was in no condition to refuse any terms which his adversary might have thought proper to propose. He saw his forces diminish daily by desertion, his cities and fortresses given up to the enemy; he suspected treachery on all sides, and as he knew not whom to trust, agreed to ratify the articles. These obliged him to renew his homage to Philip, which he had renounced in the beginning of the war; and to deliver Adelais into the hands of five persons nominated by Rich∣ard, who should espouse that princess after his return from Palestine. He agreed that all his vassals should take the oath of fealty to Richard, before his departure; and to pay twenty thousand marks of silver to the king of France, for defraying the expence of fortifying Chateauroux. Philip, on the other hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ben. Abbas. Duet Coll. G. Brito. Philipiade. G. Neubrig.</NOTE> engaged to restore all that he had taken in Berry; but he was permitted to re∣tain the cities of Le Mans and Tours, with the castles of Trone and Chateau de Loir, until all the articles should be fulfilled.</P>

<P>This treaty was first concluded at Azay, and in a few days after the agreement signed in another conference at the same place, from whence the king, in a very ill state of health, was removed to Chinon. He had been long infirm, and was now seized with a fever, which was supposed to be the immediate effect of vexation. He had formerly seen his children rebel; but now he saw his son his conqueror; he saw himself berest at once of his power, his authority, and faculties; reduced to the condition of a fugitive, and almost of a suppliant in his old age, by the ingratitude of his own issue; and to com∣plete his chagrin, prince John, upon whose fidelity and affection he had reposed himself with full confidence, deserted him in his retreat from Le Mans, and joined his adversaries. This was the severest stroke he had hitherto felt, and doubtless co-operated with his distemper, of which he died at Chinon, two days after the ratification of the treaty. His corpse was conveyed by his natural son Geoffrey to the nunnery of Fontevrault; and next day, while it lay in the abbey church, Richard chancing to enter, was struck with horror at the sight. This indeed was augmented by an accident, which the superstition of the times interpreted into a praeternatural portent. At his approach the blood gushed out at
<PB N="378" REF="3870"/>
the mouth and nostrils of the corpse, to the terror and amazement of all the spectators; and Richard's own savage heart was moved at this phaenomenon.

<P>Thus died Henry, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and thirty fifth of his reign; in the course of which he had, on sundry occasions, displayed all the abilities of a politician, all the sagacity of a legislator, and all the mag∣nanimity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a hero. He lived revered above all the princes of his time; and his death was deeply lamented by his subjects, whose happiness seems to have been the chief aim of all his endeavours. He not only enacted wholesome laws, but saw them executed with great punctuality. He was generous even to admiration, with regard to those who committed offences against his own person, but he never forgave the injuries that were offered to his people; for atrocious crimes were punished severely, without respect of persons. He was of the middle sta∣ture, and the most exact proportion; his countenance was round, fair, and rud∣dy; his blue eyes were mild and engaging, except in a transport of passion, when they sparkled like lightening, to the terror of the beholders. He was broad chested, strong, muscular, and inclined to be corpulent, though he prevented the bad effects of this disposition, by hard exercise and continual fatigue; he was temperate in his meals, even to a degree of abstinence, and seldom or never sat down, except at supper; he was eloquent, agreeable, and facetious<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remark∣ably courteous and polite; compassionate to all in distress; so charitable, that he constantly allotted one tenth of his houshold provisions to the poor; and in a time of dearth which prevailed in Anjou and Le Maine, he maintained ten thousand in∣digent persons, from the beginning of spring till the end of autumn. His talents naturally good, he had cultivated with great assiduity, and delighted in the conversation of learned men, to whom he was a generous benefactor. His me∣mory was so surprisingly tenacious, that he never forgot a face nor a circumstance that was worth remembring. Though superior to all his cotemporaries in strength, riches, true courage and military skill, he never engaged in war with∣out reluctance; and was so averse to bloodshed, that he expressed uncommon grief at the loss of every private soldier. Yet was he not exempted from human frailties: his passions naturally violent, often hurried him into excess; he was prone to anger, transported with the lust of power, and in particular accused of inconti∣nence, not only in the affair of Rosamond, whom he is said to have concealed in a labyrinth at Wodestoke, from the jealous inquiry of his wife, but also in a supposed commerce with the French princess Adelais, who was bred in England as the future wife of his son Richard. This infamous breach of honour and hospitality, if he was actually guilty, is the foulest stain upon his character, though the fact is doubtful, and we hope, the charge untrue. He was educated with high notions of the kingly prerogative, which he maintained with amazing fortitude, against all the artillery of Rome, and all the machinations of treason; for the cause of royalty happened to be connected with the independency of the English church, for which he manifested the most inviolable attachment: yet his exertion of the prerogative never interfered with the liberties of his people, which
<PB N="379" REF="3880"/>
he intrenched with many excellent laws and regulations, that rendered their bur∣thens easy and their property secure. In a word, he was the king, the priest, the father of his country, and one of the most powerful and illustrious monarchs that ever flourished on the English throne <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">By his queen Eleanor he had five sons and three daughters: namely, William, who died in his infancy; Henry, whose history we have recorded; Richard, who succeeded to his fa∣ther's throne; Geoffrey, who died at Paris, as we have mentioned above; and John, surnam∣ed Sans Terre, who ascended the throne after Richard's death: Maude, married to Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria; Eleanor, wife of Alphonsus VIII. king of Castile; Joane, matched with William II. king of Sicily, and, after his death, married to Raimund VI. count of Thoulouse. Henry had likewise by the fair Rosamond, William Longue Espée, created earl of Salisbury; and Geoffrey, bishop elect of Lin∣coln, and afterwards chancellor. There was also one Morgan, a Welshman, provost of Be∣verly, who pretended to be his natural son, by the lady of a knight named Ralf Bloet; but this pretence seems to have been founded on nothing but the man's own vanity and madness.

<P>RICHARD, surnamed Coeur de Lion or Lion's-heart, from his in∣trepidity, succeeded without opposition to his father's throne, and be∣gan his reign with such an act of tyranny and oppression, as must have afforded a very uncomfortable omen to his subjects. His father's obsequies were scarce performed, when he ordered Stephen de Tours, the late king's seneschal, to be arrested and loaded with shackles, until he had delivered up, not only the treasure committed to his charge, but also his own fortune, amounting to five and forty thousand Angeven livres: then he caused him to be divorced from his wife, because she was a gentlewoman, and he of ignoble descent; and declared, he would by his own authority annul all such unequal marriages. This man, however, whom he knew to be a faithful servant of his father, he would not dismiss from his employment; for he continued still to manage the revenue of Anjou; and indeed it must be owned for the credit of Richard's good sense, that he retained in his service all the loyal adherents of the late king; and discarded those who had deserted their master, even in his own favour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1189.</NOTE> These, whether ecclesiastic or laymen, he expelled from his court, and ever after despised as perfidious traitors; and when some barons, who had served him in his last revolt, demanded restitution of their lands and castles, which they had forfeited in former rebellions, he ordered them to be restored according to his promise, but he ejected them the very next day, observing, that those who de∣serted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

<P>The affairs of Guienne and Anjou being settled according to his plea∣sure, he repaired to Normandy, and was, by the archbishops of Canterbury and Rouen, absolved at Seez of the crime he had committed in taking up arms against his father, after having engaged in the crusade. After his absolution he was invested with the ducal sword and banner, and received the homage of all the nobility in the province; upon which occasion he displayed his generosity in divers acts of favour. He bestowed his niece Maude upon Geoffrey, son of Rotrou count de Perche: he gave the daughter of Richard Strongbow in mar∣riage to his favourite William Mareschal; and to Gilbert, the son of Roger Fitz-Rainfray, Eloisa, daughter and heiress of William de Lancaster, baron of Ken∣dal. He confirmed his brother John in possession of the four thousand marks a year in England, and the county of Mortaign in Normandy, which had been been settled upon him by his father, besides the honour of Gloucester, by virtue of his marriage with the late earl's daughter; and gave the royal assent to the election of his natural brother Geoffrey to the see of York, though he afterwards seized his castles in Normandy, which he obliged him to redeem with a consi∣derable sum of money. In a few days after his inauguration, he had an inter∣view, between Chaumont and Trie, with the king of France, who restored the

<P>Having regulated his foreign affairs, he resolved to visit his British do∣minions, which, since his father's death, had been governed by his mother Eleanor, whom he had impowered to publish an act of grace, in favour of all prisoners and transgressors, except such as had turned evidence against their accompl ces, which informers had no benefit of this indulgence. Robert, earl of Leicester, now retrieved his castles, which Henry had kept as security for his good behaviour; and other forfeited barons were indulged with the like restitution. The appenage of prince John was considerably increased by grants of lands and castles, and by marrying the heiress of the late earl of Gloucester, tho' within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, he became master of a ve∣ry considerable part of the realm. All the freemen throughout the kingdom had, by order of the queen-mother, taken the oath of fealty to Richard before his arrival, and now the same was taken by the prelates and nobility at his coro∣nation, which was solemnized in the abbey of Westminster, Ralf de Dueto, dean of St. Paul's, officiating in the room of the bishop of London, because the see happened to be then vacant.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Richard had issued a proclamation forbidding, all Jews to enter the church, during the coronation service, or intrude into the palace while he should be at dinner Notwithstanding this prohibition, which seems to have been in∣tended merely for the prevention of a croud, a few wealthy Hebrews, instigated by cur osity, endeavoured to pass unobserved in the multitude; but were detect∣ed, and roughly repelled. This violence produced a fray, in which several Jews were trodden under foot and slain, as that people were extremely odious at this juncture, when the superstition of the Christians was inflamed by the preaching of monks in favour of the crusade. The populace of London, hearing the king had ordered the Jews to be exterminated, immediately took to arms, and besieg∣ed the merchants of that nation in their houses, after having murdered all the Israelites that fell in their way. The king was no sooner apprised of this tumult than he sent Ralf de Glanville, the chief justiciary, and other noblemen, into the city to quell the disturbance and prevent further mischief; but all their en∣deavours proved ineffectual; and they were obliged to fly for the safety of their own lives. The rabble finding it impracticable to force the strong houses to which the Jews had retired, set them on fire; so that a conflagration began at different corners of the city; and the mob taking advantage of the confusion and terror which they produced, plundered Jews and Christians without distinction. The former perished either by the flames or the fury of an enraged populace; a great number of citizens were burned out of their habitations, and utterly ruined; and the disturbance continued till morning, when the rabble dispersed. Richard ordered the ringleaders of this outrageous tumult to be apprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Neubrig. Bened Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Matth. Par.</NOTE> and tried by the laws of the land: and they being convicted and executed, he published a proclamation, prohibiting such tumults for the future, and taking the Jews under his royal protection. Notwithstanding this precaution, the Jews were afterwards massacred at Lyme, Stamford, and York, though avarice seems to have been more concerned than religious zeal, in those instances of barbar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty; for many gentlemen of the province were concerned in the carnage of

York, who, having been indebted to the Jews, no sooner made an end of but∣chering that unhappy people, to the number of five hundred, than they repaired to the cathedral, where their bonds were deposited, compelled the officer to deli∣ver these obligations, and burned them in the church with great solemnity. The king, incensed at this insult upon his authority, which also affected his revenue, inasmuch as he was heir to the personal estates of usurers, ordered the bishop of Fly, at that time justiciary of the realm, to make severe examples of the guilty: but, before he arrived in Yorkshire, the principal offenders had fled into Scotland; and the citizens of York imputing what had happened to the fury of the ungo∣vernable multitude, the prelate contented himself with depriving the high sheriff and the governor of their offices, and levying fines upon the wealthiest of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>Richard, in the first assembly of his prelates and nobility convened after his coronation, at the abbey of Pupewell, in Northamptonshire, filled up the vacant sees of London, Winchester, Sarum, and Ely; and deliberated upon measures for enabling him to equip a powerful armament against the infidels, who had over-run the Holy Land. Geoffrey Riddel, late bishop of Ely, dying intestate, the king had seized his effects to a considerable value: he found in his father's treasury at Winchester, gold and silver, jewels, and rich utensils, to the amount of nine hundred thousand pounds: but even this vast sum was insufficient for the purposes of his expedition. He sold the earldom of Nor∣thumberland to Hugh, bishop of Durham, for his natural life, and the honour of Sudberg to him and his successors in that see, for ever. He set up to sale the offices of high-sheriffs, keepers of forests, and many other lucrative posts and dignities. He received considerable sums from the barons of Bedfordshire, and the knights of Surry, for disforesting parts of their country, which he had converted into forest-ground. Liberties, charters, castles, and manors of the crown, were given away to the highest bidders; and when some of his friends demonstrated to him the bad effects of such alienation, he told them he would sell the city of London, if he could find a purchaser. Ralf de Glanville, find∣ing him deaf to all honest advice, and squandering away the crown demesnes in such a profuse, unthrifty, and pernicious manner, resigned his place of justi∣ciary, and engaged in the crusade; and his post was filled by Hugh, bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, earl of Essex and Albemarle, the former of these giving a thousand marks for this employment. Besides these expedients<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duet. Coll.</NOTE> for raising money, Richard obtained a bull from pope Clement, impowering him to excuse from the crusade all those whom he should judge necessary to be lest at home for the defence of the kingdom; and a great number of people who had taken the cross in the first transport of enthusiasm, were now glad to em∣brace this indulgence. By these means the king raised a greater sum of money, than any one of his predecessors had been known to possess. The Welch, upon the death of the late king, had, under Rese ap Griffith and his son, reduced several castles, and ravaged the counties of Pembroke and Carmarthen; but this prince afterwards obtained a safe conduct from John, and came to make his submission in the king's court at Oxford; Richard, however, refused to see him, and he returned to his own country meditating revenge. To anticipate his at∣tempt, John was directed to march into Wales with a body of forces;

<P>While Richard was employed in making preparations for carrying his grand design into execution, Rotrou, count of Perche, and other ambassadors, came over to notify the resolution of the French king and his barons, who had sworn in a general council held at Paris, to meet by the close of Easter at the general rendezvous near Vezelay; to which place, Richard and his people were summoned, that the two kings might set out together for the crusade.

A dispute arising at this period, between Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, and the monks of Christ-church, about a college o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secular canons founded at Hakington, the monks complained to the pope, that this new foundation was intended to deprive them of the right of electing the archbishop of Canterbury, and throw that power into the hands of the fuffragans.

He forthwith repaired to Canterbury, with a vast number of his prelates and nobility, and decreed that the new foundation should be demolished: then the cardinal Anagni, legate from the pope, who had been detained a whole fortnight at Dover, by the king's express order, was invited to Cant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbury, and honourably received, though Richard would not allow him to exercise his legatine authority, except in removing the interdict, which Baldwin had laid upon the lands of prince John, when he married the heiress of Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucester.</P>

<P>During Richard's stay at Canterbury, he was visited by William, king of Scotland, who, taking advantage of his impatience to proceed on this expe∣dition to the Holy Land, and his eager desire of amassing money for that pur∣pose, presented him with ten thousand marks sterling, in consideration of his sur∣rendering the castles of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rwick and Roxburg, renouncing the superiority of the k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngdom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Scotland, delivering up the instrument containing the submission of him and all his barons, and receiving<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>William's homage for the northern coun∣ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.

The guardianship of the kingdom he con∣ferred on William Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gchamp, bishop of Ely, a Frenchman of low original, without influence or authority; and with him joined the bishop of Durham, as justiciary in the northern counties.

<P>These precautions being taken, Richard, accompanied by the legate, set sail from Dover, and landed the same day at Gravelines, where he was met by the count of Flanders, who attended him into Normandy. There he prac∣tised a low artifice which disgraced his character, though it answered his purpose of extorting money from his subjects. He pretended to have lost the great
<PB N="385" REF="3940"/>
seal, that he might have a pretence for issuing a proclamation, that no credit should be given to any deed, grant, or instrument, until it should receive the sanction of the new seal, which he ordered to be made for this purpose: at the same time he ordered all persons possessed of such grants to bring them in, that they might be sealed anew, and levied large fines for this indulgence. To crown his avarice, he directed the bishop of Ely, vested with the legatine power, as well as the royal authority, in England, Wales, and Ireland, to oblige every abbey and crown manor to furnish one palfrey and sumpter horse, and every city<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb. M. Paris.</NOTE> in the kingdom to find double the number, for the purposes of the expedition. The queen of France dying in the interim, the rendezvous was deferred till Mid∣summer; but in order to adjust matters in such a manner, as would prevent all disputes, the two kings agreed to a conference at Gué S. Remi, where they, and their prelates, and nobility, mutually swore to maintain peace, and defend each others territories; and, in case either of the princes should die on the expe∣dition, it was determined, that the survivor should succeed to the command of his troops and money, for the advantage of the service. After this interview, Richard sent for his mother Eleanor from England, together with Adelais, the sister of Philip, his own brother John, the two archbishops, and all the other prelates, before whom he exacted an oath of John, and Geoffrey, archbishop of York, importing, that they should not set foot in England for three years, be∣fore the expiration of which he proposed to return from Palestine: but at the request of his mother he released them both from this obligation. His large fleet assembled from different ports of the kingdom, being well manned, victu∣alled, and supplied with stores for the expedition, he, by the advice of his pre∣lates and nobility, enacted a body of regulations for the maintenance of peace, order, and discipline on board, appointing five justiciaries to see them punc∣tually executed, and issued orders for its sailing to Marseilles, where he pro∣posed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>When the time appointed for the rendezvous approached, he received the scrip and staff from the archbishop of Tours, and marched to Vezelay, where he was joined by the king of France. From thence they took the route to Lyons at the head of one hundred thousand men; but finding it ex∣tremely inconvenient for such a vast body to march together, the two kings parted at this city, Philip proceeding to Genoa, and Richard turning off to∣wards Marseilles, where he found a great number of pilgrims, who, having spent all their substance in waiting for a passage, made him a tender of their ser∣vice, and were retained. Having waited a whole week for the arrival of his fleet, he hired three large vessels and twenty gallies, for his houshold, with which he embarked for Sicily, and putting in at Salerno, remained in that place, until he was informed that his fleet had arrived in the harbour of Mefsina. Thi∣ther he immediately followed it, and, finding the king of France lodged in the town, took up his quarters in the suburbs. As he proposed to pass the winter in this island, he seized two strong castles situated on the Fare, one of which he assigned for the accommodation of his sister, widow of the late king of Sicily, and the other he converted into a magazine.</P>

<P>The citizens of Messina alarmed at these proceedings, which seemed to denote a design of conquering the island, took occasion to quarrel with the Eng∣lish,

who happened to be within the city, expelled them with great insolence, shut their gates, manned their walls, and set Richard at defiance. Next day the king of France, accompanied by his own prelates and nobility and those of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1190.</NOTE> the island, repaired to his quarters, in order to compromise the quarrel: but, in the midst of their deliberations, the Messenians made a sally, and after having killed a good number of men and horses, attacked the quarters of Hugh le Brun with great impetuosity. Richard, enraged at this insult, took to his arms immediately, and charging the citizens, not only repulsed them to the gates, but assaulted the city itself with such fury, that notwithstanding the resistance of the inhabitants, reinforced by the French troops quartered within the walls, the place was taken by assault, and the standard of England displayed upon the ram∣parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to Col.</NOTE> The king of France, who had entered the city immediately before the attack, exerted all his vigour in the defence of the place, and shot three Eng∣lish soldiers with a cross-bow from the walls; so that Richard had great cause to complain of his behaviour; nevertheless, his conduct on this occasion was remarkably moderate: far from molesting the French quarters, he quitted the city, and encamped within a fortification which he erected in the suburbs. This condescension, however, could not appease the resentment of Philip, who re∣garded the assault as an affront offered to his dignity; and from this period con∣ceived an implacable rancour against the king of England. This grudge how∣ever be thought proper to conceal for the present, and agreed with Richard in making ordinances to be observed by both armies, for the prevention of gam∣ing, clipping money, and dearth of provisions; as also for the choice of whole∣some victuals, the regulation of markets, and the reduction of immoderate pro∣fit on merchandize. Richard, in order to render providence propitious to the undertaking, granted a charter in behalf of his English subjects who should suf∣fer by shipwreck, giving up in their favour, the right which the crown had to the goods saved in such disasters: at the same time, he put himself in a course<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>The Messinese had smarted severely in their quarrel with the king of England, who had permitted the soldiers to plunder the city; and their king Tancred found himself extremely incommoded by the dispute, in consequence of which an hundred thousand slaves had escaped to the mountains, from whence they made incursions, and ravaged the whole country. The Sicilian prelates had laboured to effect an accommodation, and the king, in effect an usurper, whose crown was disputed by Henry VI. emperor of Germany, in right of his wife Constance, unwilling to incur the resentment of such a powerful prince as Richard, made uncommon advances towards a treaty of peace. This was at length concluded, on condition that Tancred should pay to Richard twenty thousand oúnces of gold, in lieu of legacies bequeathed to Henry of England, by the late king William II. who had married his daughter; that he should bestow one of his daughters in marriage on young Arthur, duke of Brittany, whom Richard had declared his successor, in case he himself should die without issue; and that twenty thousand ounces of gold should be forthwith deposited as her<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bid.</NOTE> fortune, to be restored, provided the marriage should not take effect. As for the inhabitants of Messina, Richard ordered the plunder to be restored; but
<PB N="387" REF="3960"/>
knowing them to be a faithless mongrel race, descended from Greeks, Lom∣bards, and Saracens, he ordered them to pull down their gates, and deliver hos∣tages for their peaceable behaviour: then he built a strong castle upon the top of an high mountain that over-looked the city, distinguishing it by the appella∣tion of Mate-Griffon, or Griffon-Slayer, alluding to the name of Griffons, be∣stowed as a term of reproach upon the inhabitants of Messina. Here while he entertained Hugh, duke of Burgundy, and a great number of French noblemen on Christmas-day, he and his guests were obliged to rise from table and quell a tumult, arising from a quarrel between some English and Pisan sailors: but it was next day renewed, upon a Pisan's murdering an Englishman at church: both sides fought with equal fury, and many lives were lost, before the kings of France and England could advance with their forces, and put an end to the battle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

<P>In a few days after this disturbance, a trifling incident served to de∣note the impetuosity of Richard's disposition. Having rode out to take the air, accompanied by several French and English knights, of which number was William de Barre, famous for his courage and dexterity, the king, who had formerly taken this cavalier in a skirmish near Mante, perceiving a man leading an ass loaden with canes, distributed these among the company, and they began to tilt at one another in the Moorish manner. In the course of this pastime Wil∣liam happened to tear the king's coat; and Richard incensed at the presumption of a man who had formerly broke his parole with him in Normandy, ran at him with great fury; but, instead of dismounting William, his own saddle gave way, and he came to the ground: a circumstance which piqued the king's pride to such a degree, that he ordered de Barre to be gone, and never appear again in his presence. At the intercession, however, of the prelates and nobility, he was permitted to prosecute the voyage to the Holy-Land, where he signalized<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vinesauf.</NOTE> his valour in such a manner, as effectually retrieved the favour of Richard.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while the French king disguised his animosity so well, that the other never suspected his sentiments; but treated him as a particular friend and generous ally. He presented Philip with divers English ships, and half the money he had received from Tancred; and distributed his treasure among the French knights with such profusion, that he is said to have given away in one month more than any of his predecessors had bestowed in a whole year. At length he visited the Sicilian king at Catanea, who received him with parti∣cular marks of honour and respect, and was so pleased with his open, frank de∣meanor, that he made him acquainted with Philip's malevolence. This plainly appeared in a letter from the king of France to Tancred, assuring him, that Richard intended to deprive him of his crown; and proposing that the Sicilian should fall upon him suddenly with his forces, in which case he would second his attempt. The English monarch was confounded at this instance of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfidy; the truth of which he had no reason to doubt, when he saw Philip's signet, and Tancred offered to prove that he received it from the duke of Burgundy. He carefully preserved this evidence, and having been splendidly entertained by the Sicilian monarch, to whom he presented the famous sword of Arthur, celebrated under the name of Caliburne, he returned to Messina with a hearty contempt of his French ally. Philip could not help perceiving a total alteration in his be∣haviour, and sent the count of Flanders to expostulate with him on the subject,
<PB N="388" REF="3970"/>
when Richard delivered the letter into his hands, desiring he would present it to the king of France, who, at sight of it, exhibited signs of extreme confusion; though he soon recollected himself, and pretended it was a stratagem contrived<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1191.</NOTE> Richard had never been affianced to this princess, and never express∣ed the least inclination for the match, except when his intention was to distress his father; for his heart had been captivated by the beauty of Berengaria, daugh∣ter of Sanchez, king of Navarre, and he had already employed his mother Eleanor to make a journey into Guienne, and negociate a marriage between him and that amiable princess. The proposal was immediately embraced, and the contract being ratified, the queen-mother and her future daughter-in-law tra∣velled over land to Naples, having been joined on the road by the count of Flan∣ders: they were thence conveyed to Brindisi, because Messina, being already crouded, could not contain them with their numerous retinue. Philip was perfectly well acquainted with all these transactions, and threatened loudly to renounce all friendship with the king of England; but the dispute was compromised in an∣other treaty; by which Richard was released from all pretended engagements to Adelais, who afterwards married William II. count of Ponthieu, who was the principal hostage given by Philip for his performance of articles. The French king ceded Gisors, Naufle, Neufchatel de S. Denys, and the Vexin Normand, to Richard, and the heirs male of his body; in default of which they should re∣vert to Philip, and in case of his death without issue male, be re-united with the domain of Normandy: they agreed that Richard's eldest son, if heaven should bless him with male offspring, should hold the Norman dominions of Philip in capite; that the English king should pay ten thousand marks of silver, at four different payments; and cede the fiefs Yssadun and Grassay, with all that was claimed in Auvergne by the king of France, who, on his side, should yield to Rich∣ard, Cahors and Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, except the two royal abbies of Figeac and Souillac.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> The treaty being signed and ratified, the king of France took his de∣parture from Messina for the Holy Land, and Richard gave him a short con∣voy with his gal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies; then tacking about to Reggio, took on board his mother and Berengaria, with whom he returned that same evening to the place from whence he had set sail: Eleanor, in a few days, embarked on her return for England, and the princess of Navarre remained with Richard's sister Jane, dowager of Si∣cily, until he could assemble asufficient number of vessels for the transportation of his cavalry. These being procured, and every other necessary prepared, he demolished the fort of Mate-Griffon, and sailed from Messina with above two hundred ships and gallies. In two days the fleet was dispersed in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>storm, and the king obliged to put into the isle of Crete, from whence he steered to Rhodes: while two of his large ships were stranded on the coast of Cyprus, and Roger, his vice-chancellor, drowned, with several knights and their atten∣dants. Those who reached the shore were immediately seized, stripped, and imprisoned by Isaac, stiling himself emperor of Cyprus, who would not suf∣fer a third vessel, having on board the queen of Sicily and Berengaria, to enter the harbour of Limesol. Richard being informed of their distress, advanced to their relief with his gallies, and found them lying at anchor on the open shore, exposed to all the extremity of the weather. Incensed at the barbarity of this in∣solent
<PB N="389" REF="3980"/>
tyrant, he sent a message to demand his pilgrims, with all their effects which had been seized; and, receiving an arrogant answer, immediately landed his men. Isaac did not decline an engagement, in which he was defeated; the town soon capitulated, and the fleet was brought into the harbour. The Cypriots reassembled another body of forces, and, giving battle the next day to Richard, were routed again with great slaughter. This overthrow determined the fate of the island. All the castles and towns admitted the conqueror, and Isaac himself submitted at discretion. The conquest of Cyprus being so easily atchieved, the king espoused Berengaria, who was crowned the same day at Limesol, by John bishop of Evreux, assisted by the archbishops of Apamea and Auch, and the bishop of Bayonne. After this ceremony Richard received the homage of the nobility, and confirmed the laws, customs, and privileges of the Cypriots, who having been oppressed by Isaac, hailed the king of England as their deliverer. Nor was their gratitude confined to empty professions; they presented him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vinesauf. Benedict. Hoveden.</NOTE> with a moiety of their effects; and engaged to send a supply of provisions to the Christians, at the siege of Acon, in which they were at that time employed.</P>

<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Having regulated the affairs of Cyprus, and bestowed the govern∣ment of the island upon Richard de Camville and Robert de Turnham, the king set sail for Acon, whither he had already dispatched the two queens and Isaac's on∣ly daughter, with the best part of his fleet and forces. In his passage he encoun∣tered a prodigious large vessel, equipped by Saladine at Barut, containing fifteen hundred of his choice troops, commanded by seven admirals, and loaden with provision and warlike stores, for the garrison of Acon. This huge un∣weildy ship he attacked and destroyed, and arrived before the place, to the in∣expressible joy of the Christian army, and the terror and dismay of the besieged, which increased, even to despair, when they understood the loss of the vessel, in which all their hopes were centered. The siege, which had hitherto languished, was now carried on with surprising vigour. Richard's courage, liberality, and magnificence, not only engaged the hearts of the soldiery, but totally eclipsed the king of France, who became envious of his glory, and jealous of his great∣ness. Though Richard had shared with him the booty and prisoners taken in the carrack, according to a convention made in Sicily, by which they agreed to divide the spoils of the infidels, Philip was not contented; but laid claim to one half of Cyprus, and the riches there acquired. To this demand Richard replied, that though their agreement related to Palestine only, he would divide his conquest with Philip, provided that prince would act in the same manner towards him, with regard to the dominions and effects of the count of Flan∣ders, and the Castillan of St. Omers, lately deceased, whose effects he had seized for his own advantage. This answer effectually silenced the French king, who dropped his pretensions; and they renewed their agreement about the acquisitions that should be made in the Holy Land, appointing the Knights Templars and Hospitallers as umpires of the partition. By this time the be∣sieged<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gul. Neu∣brig.</NOTE> were reduced to extremity, and Saladine finding it impracticable to raise the siege, allowed them to surrender, upon the best terms they could procure: the capitulation they obtained did not even secure their lives; for they obliged themselves to remain in custody until their heads should be redeemed with two hundred thousand Byzantines, and in failure of this ransom, within a certain time, they were to be at the mercy of the conquerors. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoved:</NOTE></P>

<P>The city being surrendered, and Philip having taken possession of his share, according to the determination of the arbitrators, he desired Richard would consent to his return, as the air of Asia did not agree with his constitu∣tion, and he should certainly die unless rest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to his own country. Under this pretext he harboured the design of making himself master of Flanders, and perhaps of invading Normandy. All the princes of the army exclaimed against his deserting them before the crusade should be finished; but he persisted in his resolution, and renewed his demand upon Cyprus, which he thought Richard would buy off with his consent to Philip's retreat. Accordingly he became so importunate on both subjects, that the king of England granted his request, upon his taking a public oath on the evangelists, that he would abstain from all hostilities against the territories of Richard, and even protect them against all invaders to the utmost of his power. Having thus quieted the apprehensions of his rival, who accommodated him with two of his best gallies, he se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail from Acon, leaving his troops under the command of the duke of Burgundy; and, in his passage through Italy, complained to pope Celestine III. that he could not act in concert with Richard, whose insolence was altogether intolera∣ble: he therefore desired his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness would ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olve him of his original vow, which he had not performed, as well as of the oath he had sworn to the king of England, that he might revenge himself upon that haughty prince.

<P>After Philip's departure, the whole charge of the war devolved up∣on Richard, who found himself in a very perplexed situation, occasioned by the contest between Guy de Luzignan and Conrade, marquis of Montferrat, about the crown of Jerusalem: an accommodation had been effected by the in∣terposition of the other princes, and it was agreed, that Guy should possess the kingdom for life; that the succession should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all to Conrade and his heirs; and that in the mean time they should equally share the revenues. Notwithstanding this pacification, Conrade still maintained a correspondence wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saladine, and avoided a junction with the king of England, who having repaired the fort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi∣cations of Acon, began his march for Joppa, along the sea-coast, for the con∣venience of being supplied with provisions by the shipping. Saladine hovered with his army upon the mountains, ready to attack him with the first favourable opportunity, and at length gave battle to the Christians, as they passed a river in the neighbourhood of Caesarea. Here he was routed with the slaughter of for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y thousand men, chiefly by the valour and conduct of Richard; and he forthwith ordered Caesarea, Joppa, and Ascalon to be demolished. The king of England, howeve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, repaired the fortifications of the two first of these towns, and repeopled them with part of the inhabitants of Acon.

<P>While Richard thus gathered laurels in Palest ne, his kingdom of England groaned under the oppressive administration of William Bishop of Ely,
<PB N="391" REF="4000"/>
whom he had left guardian of the realm. Instead of co-operating with the bishop of Durham as his colleague, he had arrested the person of that prelate, who was obliged to purchase his release by delivering into his hands the castles of Windsor, Newcastle upon Tyne, the manor of Sadberg, with the county of Northumberland; and giving his own son and Gilbert de la Ley as hostages for his quiet submission. Hugh complained of this treatment in letters to the king, who received them at Marseilles, and sent orders to William to restore the places he had wrested from the bishop; but he refused to comply with these instruc∣tions, on pretence of knowing the king's mind better than it could be explained in writing, and he demeaned himself in all respects with the most intolerable pride and arrogance. He exposed every thing to sale with the most shameful venality: he deprived both clergy and laity of their churches, lands, and posses∣sions, with which he enriched his own relations and dependants: he exhausted the king's revenue by m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king purchases for himself; insomuch that he bought every estate that was to be sold: the vacant churches and abbeys he either kept for his own use, or bestowed on his own creatures, among whom likewise he di∣stributed castles and posts, which he extorted from others by dint of menaces and persecution. In his visitation of the religious houses he travelled with a party of fifteen hundred horse, and such a retinue of knights, clergy, servants, min∣strels, dogs and horses, that the convent in which he lodged could scarcely, in three years, recover the damage sustained in one night's entertainment. The nobility truckled to him with the most abject complaisance, expressing the ut∣most ambition to marry his nieces and relations, tho' like himself sprang from the dregs of the people; and even prince John was treated by him with such indig∣nity, that he appealed to his brother for redress. In a word, the civil and lega∣tine<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. G.

<P>Richard, tho' informed of these particulars from different correspond∣ents, while he resided at Messina, was so bigotted to his own choice, that he would not depose this haughty viceroy; but dispatched Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and William Mareschal earl of Strigul, with positive orders to the chan∣cellor, implying that nothing should be done in the administration without their advice, and that of the counsellors whom he had appointed before his departure: but, when they arrived, they durst not deliver their credentials; so that Wil∣liam pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeded in his usual career. Among other acts of arbitrary power, he divested Gerard de Camville of the sheriffdom of Lincolnshire, and commanded him to surrender the castle of which he was hereditary castellan.

He received information of the pope's death, in consequence of which his legatine power vanished so, that he found himself deprived o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the best half of his authority; and, perceiving that the noblemen in his army were well affected towards prince John, he the more willingly lent an ear to proposals of accommodation.

That prelate had appointed him his official in the archdeaconry of Rouen, even contrary to the inclination of the late king, who always regarded Longchamp as a perfidious miscreant. Geoffrey had been for some time elect of York; but Baldwin of Canterbury claiming the prerogative of consecrating the archbishops of that see, and the other refusing to give up its independancy, the suffragans were forbid to perform the ceremonies of conse∣cration, and the temporalities were sequestered in the hands of the chancellor. When queen Eleanor parted with her son Richard in Sicily, the king desired her to solicit pope Celestine for the confirmation of Geoffrey's election: and that pontiff had ordered the archbishop of Tours to perform the office of his consecration, immediately after which he received the pall with a bull of privi∣lege, exempting the see of York from the jurisdiction of all legates, except those who should be sent occasionally into England a latere. Thus confirmed, Geoffrey proceeded for Witsand, in order to embark for England; but, when he reached the castle of Guisnes, he understood that the countess of Flanders had, at the desire of Longchamp, given orders to prevent his passage. As this restriction did not extend to his retinue, they were sent over in a Bologne ship; and he himself going on board of a small English vessel, landed at Dover, where he was immediately taken into custody by the chancellor's directions. He made shift, however, to escape from the party by which he had been arrested, and took refuge in the church of St. Martin, a privileged place belonging to the monks of Canterbury. Here he was invested by a body of Brabantines, who at length dragged him in his pontisicals from the altar, and imprisoned him in the castle, after they had plundered his baggge and sent his horses to the chan∣cellor.</P>

<P>The whole nation exclaimed against this unprovoked violence, offered to the person of an archbishop who was universally beloved. The bishop of Lincoln excommunicated all concerned in the outrage, a sentence which was afterwards confirmed by the rest of the prelates at Reading, where prince John, commonly stiled count of Mortaign, summoned a general assembly. He had likewise espoused the cause of Geoffrey; and the bishops of London, Coven∣try, and Norwich, threatened the land with an interdict, in case of his being de∣tained in prison; so that Longchamp thought proper to set him at liberty, and he repaired with the other prelates to Reading. Here Walter, archbishop of Rouen, read the king's letters appointing him to superintend the election for filling up the see of Canterbury, and with his colleagues to assist William in the administration. As the chancellor had prevented the vacancy from being filled, he refused to admit him and his colleagues into his councils, in dia∣metrical opposition to the king's pleasure; oppressed the people, and, in parti∣cular, treated the archbishop of York with such indignity; he proposed that Longchamp should be deposed from the government, according to the tenour of the king's letters, which he produced; and William, then residing at Wind∣sor,
<PB N="393" REF="4020"/>
was summoned to meet them the next day at Lodbridge, between that place and Reading. William promised to meet them at the appointed rendezvous, and had actually proceeded two or three miles with an armed force, when his heart failing him, he took the road to London and shut himself up in the Tower, the fortifications of which he himself had repaired: but being invested by the nobility and citizens before he could supply the place with a sufficient store of provisions, he endeavoured to engage prince John in his interest by dint of magnificent promises. That expedient miscarrying, he was forced to submit to the judgment of the prelates and nobility, who, after a full hearing, depriv∣ed him of his posts and castles, except those of Dover, Cambridge, and Here∣ford, which he possessed before the king's departure; and the places of chancel∣lor and justiciary were supplied by the archbishop of Rouen, a prelate of uncom∣mon abilities and untainted integrity. William, unwilling to part with the castles which he had usurped, retired to Dover, from whence he endeavoured to make his escape beyond sea, in woman's apparel; but, being detected by the populace, to whom he had rendered himself extremely odious, they treated him with great indignity, and, at last, confined him to a dark cellar. The archbishop of Rouen pitying his condition, sent an order to release him, with a licence to leave the kingdom, in consequence of which he crossed over to Normandy, where he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

<P>He no sooner arrived on the continent, than he sollicited pope Ce∣lestine to renew his legation, and complained in letters to his holiness, and the king, that he had been deprived of the administration by the faction of John, count de Mortaign, who had a design upon the kingdom. The pope, believing his remonstrances, appointed him legate of England, and ordered the bishops of the realm to excommunicate the count and all that were concerned in the pri∣vation of Longchamp. Of these William sent over a list to Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, together with the pope's mandates; which, however, no prelate would execute. On the contrary, the justiciaries seized all the rents of the see of Ely, in the king's name, as some sort of satisfaction for two years royal revénue which he had embezzled. Mean while he found means to purchase John's favours, and resolved to repair to England with his legatine dignity. He accordingly took shipping and landed at Dover, from whence he sent messengers to the queen-mother to notify his legation and arrival. A council was immediately assembled, and John discovered his partiality in such a manner as scandalized Eleanor, who reprimanded him publicly for his attachment to such a villain. It was judged proper, however, to take off the edge of this attachment with a subsidy of two thousand marks from the Exchequer; then the prince viewed the matter in a different light; and it was unanimously decreed that an appeal should be made to the pope against the legation of Longchamp, who was order∣ed to quit the kingdom immediately as a disturber of the public peace. Wil∣liam, being informed of this determination, laid his own diocese under interdict, and returned in great confusion to Normandy, where he exerted all his endeavours<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bened. Abb.

<P>Philip the French king, immediately after his return from Palestine, proposed a conference with William Fitzralph, seneschal of Normandy, and the prelates and nobility of that dukedom; a conference was accordingly held in
<PB N="394" REF="4030"/>
the usual place, where he demanded his sister Adelais, with the castle of Gisors and the counties of Eu and Aumale, which he pretended were ceded to him by the treaty of Meffina. The Normans replied, that they had no orders on that subject, and therefore could not comply with his demand: he threatned to do himself justice by force of arms; and they made preparations for a vigorous defence. Baffled in this project, he tampered with John, count de Mortaign, whom he invited to a conference, offering to bestow upon him his sister Ade∣lais in marriage, and to put him in possession of all Richard's dominions on the continent immediately after the solemnization of the nuptials. John was ripe for any design against Richard, who had declared Arthur his successor, not only in his treaty with Tancred, but in letters to Longchamp, who entred into a ne∣gotiation with William king of Scotland in order to secure this succession. That prelate now changed his party, and employed all his address to corroborate the proposals of Philip, which John embraced without hesitation, and was on the point of crossing the sea in compliance with Philip's invitation; when his depar∣ture was prevented by the remonstrances of the queen-mother, together with the menaces of the justiciaries, who threatened to seize all his lands and castles should he presume to leave the kingdom. At the same time, all the prelates and nobility were summoned to London, where they renewed their oath of fealty to Richard; a circumstance which greatly damped the hopes which John had con∣ceived. The French king, disappointed in this quarter, formed the design of invading Normandy; but his nobility would not join him in such an expedition, contrary to the oath they had taken. The pope had sent Octavian, bishop of Ostia and Jordan, abbot of Fossa Nova, as his legates to compromise the dif∣ference between the archbishop of Rouen and William Longchamp; but the seneschal of Normandy would not allow them to enter the dutchy, which, during the pilgrimage of the king, was exempted from all legatine jurisdiction. Tho' Octavian, at the desire of Philip, excommunicated this officer and all his abettors, and laid the dominions under an interdict; Jordano refused to join in these censures, and for that reason was expelled from the territories of France; but his conduct was approved by the pope, who repealed the sentences, and re∣fused<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The factions of Guy de Luzignan and Conrade divided the Chris∣tians in such a manner, that no effectual service could be performed against the Saracens; and there was no other prospect of union, than that of Conrade's elevation to the throne of Jerusalem; but, as Guy could not be expect∣ed to resign his kingdom without an equivalent, Richard generously pre∣sented him with the crown of Cyprus, which was enjoyed by him and his de∣scendants. This expedient removed all obstacles to an accommodation, and Conrade being perfectly well satisfied with his fortune, resolved to join the cru∣sards without further delay, when he was stabbed in the streets of Tyre by two assassins, who for this purpose had insinuated themselves into his service. They were subjects of a petty Saracen prince, whose territories lay in the mountains of Phoenicia, and who was known by the name of the old Man of the Moun∣tain. He was an artful prince who knew very well how to turn the superstition of Mahomet to his own advantage. As he could not defend himself from the encroachments of his powerful neighbours, by open force, he contrived an ef∣fectual
<PB N="395" REF="4040"/>
method to revenge the injuries he should sustain. He maintained a band of enthusiasts, who implicitly obeyed his orders, tho' hedged with the most im∣minent danger, in full persuasion, that should they die in the execution, Para∣dise would be their recompence. These he dispatched occasionally to murder those princes who had done him wrong: and they pursued their aim with in∣credible fortitude and perseverance; so that all the potentates of that part of Asia, were afraid of giving umbrage to the lord of the mountain. One of his subjects being driven by stormy weather into the harbour of Tyre, was plun∣dered and slain by order of Conrade. The Scheic, or old man, demanded satisfac∣tion, and the blame was laid upon Reginald, lord of Sidon. This charge was examined, and found false by the Scheic, who sent another messenger for redress to Conrade, who not only refused to do justice, but was, with difficulty, restrained from putting the messenger to death. In revenge for this outrage, the as∣sassins were dispatched with instructions to murder the offender, and executed their orders with great deliberation. Being apprehended, they avowed the com∣mand of their lord, who afterwards sent a letter or manifesto to the European<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vinesauf. Neubrig. Rymer's Foe∣dera.</NOTE> princes, explaining and justifying his conduct, and clearing Richard from the imputation of being concerned in this murder, which had been fixed upon his character by his enemies. Conrade was succeeded in the throne by Henry, count of Champagne, who married his widow, and marched to the assistance of Rich∣ard, who had just reduced the strong fortress of Darum, in the plains of Pales∣tine. Thus reinforced, he began his march to Jerusalem, which he resolved to besiege; but, when they approached the city, the siege was judged impractica∣ble, from the difficulty of receiving supplies of provision; and the duke of Burgundy retreated with the French troops to Tyre, from whence he proposed to embark for Europe. The English troops being diminished by continual fa∣tigues and repeated engagements, all hope of making new conquests vanished, and Richard having received divers letters from the regency, solliciting his im∣mediate return to prevent the disorders that threatned his kingdom, he resolved to take his leave of Palestine, in which he had enacted miracles of valour to the terror and admiration of the infidels. Saladine still commanded a vast ar∣my among the mountains, ready to fall upon the maritime towns as soon as the king of England should quit the country; and accordingly Richard, on his arrival at Acon, understood that the town of Joppa was taken, and the castle reduced to extremity. He no sooner received this intelligence, than he order∣ed his forces to march thither by land, while he himself with a handful of troops was transported by sea, and compelled the Saracens to raise the siege, by the terror of his name, and a series of the most daring exploits in which he exposed his person to the utmost danger. As he could not, however, remain in Pales∣tine, with any regard to his own interest, or, indeed, with any prospect of ac∣complishing the great aim of the expedition, he agreed upon a truce of three years with Saladine, on condition that Ascalon should be demolished; that the Christians should fortify Joppa, and inhabit all the places on the sea-coast, while the Saracens should remain in possession of the hilly country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Coll.</NOTE></P>

<P>These stipulations being ratified, and the affairs of Palestine settled in the best manner the circumstance of the times would permit, Richard returned to Acon, where he embarked for Europe. Not caring to pass through France, or the territories of Tholouse, he directed his course to Ragusa, from whence
<PB N="396" REF="4050"/>
he determined to travel incognito through Germany; but, being discovered in a village near Vienna, he was discovered by Leopold, duke of Austria, who, glad of this opportunity to revenge an affront which he had sustained from Richard at Acon, ordered him to be arrested and loaded with shackles, to the disgrace of honour and humanity. His avarice was, in all probability, as much con∣cerned as his revenge in this ungenerous insult; for he expected a share of the ransom, and even stipulated for the sum of fifty thousand marks, when he deli∣vered him to the emperor Henry VI. who received the prize in a transport of joy, tho' the two nations were at peace with one another, and he could not find the slightest pretence for detaining a prince whose person ought to have been held sacred, considering the service he had done to the christian cause in Pales∣tine. Henry looked upon Richard with an evil eye, since his treaty and alliance with Tancred king of Sicily, to whose dominions the emperor laid claim, in right<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Philip of France being informed of Richard's captivity, renewed all his offers to John, count of Mortaign; and sent ambassadors to Canute V. king of Denmark, to demand his sister Ingeburga in marriage, desiring no other portion with that princess, than an assignment of Canute's claim to England, and the assistance of an armament in his endeavours to conquer that kingdom. The proposal was accepted, and the lady married at Amiens to Phi∣lip, who repudiated her the very next day, and a formal divorce was after∣wards obtained on pretence of consanguinity between this princess and Philip's former queen. This affront, in all probability, detached the Danes from the in∣terest of the French king, who derived no assistance from that quarter; tho' prince John embarked in his measures without hesitation, and crossed the sea in order to confer more intimately with his ally. The seneschal and barons of the dutchy, having no suspicion of his designs, invited him to a conference at An∣jou, to consult about his brother's ransom, and the defence of the dominions threatened by the French monarch; but he gave them to understand, that he would not concur in any measures against Philip, unless they would swear feal∣ty to him as their sovereign; and this proposal they absolutely rejected. He forthwith engaged in a treaty with the king of France, who agreed to give him his sister Adelais in marriage, with the county of Artois, which had lately de∣volved to France at the death of the count of Flanders, and John, in return, ceded to him all Normandy north of the Seine, except Rouen and several other places, and did homage for all his brother's foreign dominions; this con∣tract<NOTE PLACE="marg">P.

<P>Philip having found his nobility so averse to this expedition, when it was last proposed, had recourse to a low artifice, by which he persuaded them to assist him in the execution of his scheme. He affected to be afraid of his per∣son, raised a company of life-guards armed with brazen maces, and would not allow any stranger to appear in his presence; having excited the wonder and cu∣riosity of his subjects by this strange alteration in his demeanour, he called an assembly of his peers at Paris, and expressed his apprehensions of being assassi∣nated by the emissaries of Richard, who he affirmed was the projector of Con∣rade's
<PB N="397" REF="4060"/>
death; and, not contented with that murder, had hired assassins in the east to dispatch him in the midst of his court at Paris. The wiser part of the assembly doubted the truth of the imputation, and advised that no hostilities should be committed against the dominions of the king of England, until that prince should return, as he still wore the badge of the crusade; and an inva∣sion of his territories in his absence, would not only scandalize all christian powers, but also subject the invaders to the pope's censure. This opinion was over-ruled by the majority of the council; and Philip entered Normandy at the head of a numerous army. As he and John carried on an intelligence with some barons of the country, he made himself master of Gisors and several strong places, without opposition; the governors not only betrayed their trust, but joined the enemy, who reduced the counties of Eu and Aumale, by trea∣chery, and, advancing to Rouen, summoned the inhabitants to surrender on pain of being put to the sword. The citizens, encouraged by the presence of Ro∣bert earl of Leicester, just returned from Palestine, where he had signalized his valour in a very extraordinary manner, despised the threats of Philip, and obliged him to raise the siege, after he had been repulsed in various assaults. He had met with indifferent success in a negotiation with the emperor, whom he offered to bribe with a large sum of money, if he would deliver his vassal Richard into his hands; but this scandalous contract was opposed by the princes of the empire. The pope threatened to excommunicate Philip, and lay his kingdom under an interdict, if he would not immediately withdraw his troops from Normandy; and John had not succeeded according to his expectation in England. These concurring reasons induced the French king to hearken to the proposals for a truce, which he granted, on condition that he should re∣ceive twenty thousand marks at different payments, to commence after Rich∣ard's release; and, in the mean time, be put in possession of certain castles by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>John had carried over to England a great number of foreigners, and expected a further reinforcement of French and Flemings: at his landing he seized the castles of Windsor and Wallingford; and, pretending his brother was dead, required Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and the other justiciaries, to take the oath of allegiance, and proceed to his coronation. The regency giving no credit to his assertion, he sollicited the nobility for their assistance, fortified his castles, and ravaged the demesnes of his brother. The justiciaries hearing his auxiliaries were ready to embark at Witsand, ordered bodies of troops to march down to the sea-side, and secured the ports in such a manner, that the merce∣naries durst not venture to attempt a descent. They raised another army, with which they besieged and took Windsor. A third body was assembled in the North by Geoffrey, archbishop of York; the castle of Tikehill was invested by Hugh, bishop of Durham; and John, finding himself unable to cope with the power and authority of the regents, was fain to purchase a truce by giving up the castles of Pec and Wallingford. During this cessation, John withdrew into France, and Hubert Walter, bishop of Salisbury, arriving in England with letters of recommendation to the king, was, by the unanimous suffrages of the bishops and monks, elected archbishop of Canterbury. This prelate was left<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Richard had been cruelly treated at his detention by a brutal prince devoid of honour and humanity, and by him delivered into the hands of the emperor, who was a very proper patron to countenance such barbarity and baseness. As the captive prince did not know to what extremities he might be reduced, and what condescensions he might be obliged to make, he wrote to the archbishop of Rouen, to obey no orders that should come from him, if they seemed contrary to his honour and the good of the nation. At last, by the mediation of the princes of the empire, his ransom was fixed in the diet of Worms, at one hundred and fifty thousand marks of silver; and it was determined that he should be set at liberty, on paying two thirds of that sum, and giving hostages for the remainder. Hubert, lately established in the see of Canterbury, had attended the king in Palestine, and hearing of his disaster, visited him in his captivity; by this prelate he sent a commission to raise money for his ransom, and find hostages for the security of the last payment. Every military tenant was, by the feudal law, and the nature of his tenure, obliged to give aid for the ransom of his lord from captivity. This soccage was accordingly raised in England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together with a talliage or hydage upon cities, boroughs and manors, belonging to the crown, or in the king's hands, by escheat. These taxes were assessed by the itinerant justices; but, besides these, great sums were raised from the voluntary contributions of the people zealous for their king's release. The parochial clergy granted one tenth of their tythes; the bishops, abbots, and nobility, freely parted with a fourth of their income; the Cester∣tians gave up all their revenue of wool for one year; the parishes melted down their sacred chalices; and the cathedrals and monasteries sold their plate and treasures to the amount of thirty thousand marks, on a promise of being reim∣bursed after the king's return.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The king of France was very much mortified when he heard of the agreement touching the ransom of Richard; and tampered with the em∣peror to renounce the treaty. He proposed an interview at Vaucoleurs, where he offered to marry the daughter of Henry his uncle, the count Palatine, and to gratify him with a sum equal to the ransom, if he would find some pre∣text for detaining Richard even but another year. Henry was very well in∣clined to this expedient, which, tho' perfidious to the last degree, flattered his avarice, to which he sacrificed every other consideration: but he was afraid of incurring the resentment of the princes by whom Richard was beloved, and con∣tinued fluctuating between different motives equally sordid, until the day fixed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1194.</NOTE> for the deliverance of Richard. This was performed with great ceremony at Mentz, in presence of the German nobility; and the archbishop of Rouen, with the other hostages, were produced when the king was set at liberty. Richard, however, had no sooner taken the road to Cologn and Antwerp, than the em∣peror, who could not bear the prospect of losing the prize which Phi ip of∣fered for his further detention, resolved to take him again into custody, and sent immediate orders for stopping him at the port of Swyne, where he in∣tenked to embark for England. Richard, apprized of the negotiation between Philip and Henry, had sent for ships from England, which he found waiting for him at the mouth of the Scheld, but the wind proving contrary, he would, in all probability, have been taken, had not a friend at the emperor's court sent him advice of his danger. He, upon this notice, went hastily on board,
<PB N="399" REF="4080"/>
and put to sea immediately; and, a favourable gale springing up, he arrived in safety at Sandwich. The emperor, chagrined at his disappointment, exhausted his resentment upon the hostages, who were confined and treated with uncom∣mon rigour; and the king of France was so enraged at Richard's escape, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.

<P>Richard was received by the Londoners with great rejoicings, and such ostentation of wealth, as amazed the German noblemen who accompanied him to England so much that one of the number said he would have paid much dearer for his ransom had the emperor known the affluence of his subjects. John, immediately before his brother's arrival, had sent over from Norman∣dy his chaplain Adam de S. Edmund, with orders to his adherents to fortify his castles, and attack the enemy. This ambassador was so vain of his com∣mission, that he talked openly of the intimate correspondence between his master and the king of France; so that, being apprehended, his papers discovered all the designs of prince John and his confederates. A council being immediately assembled, orders were given by the justiciaries to besiege his castles, disseize him of all his possessions; and the bishops excommunicated him and all his ad∣herents. His fortresses being scattered over all parts of the kingdom, the no∣blemen, and even the bishops levied forces in their different districts to besiege these haunts of rebellion. Marlborough, Lancaster, and St. Michael's mount, were soon reduced; but Nottingham and Tikehill held out till the arrival of the king, who approved of the steps which had been taken, and, after having re∣posed himself three days at London, appeared in person before them, and both castles surrendered at discretion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE></P>

<P>Immediately after the reduction of these sorts, Richard convoked a general council at Nottingham, where he desired judgment against John count of Mortaign, and Hugh Novant bishop of Coventry, one of his abettors. The first forfeited all his possessions, and a process was instituted against the other, both as bishop and high-sheriff of the county. In this council a tax cal∣led Hidage was laid upon every plough-land throughout England; and a day fixed for the second coronation of the king at Winchester. This was per∣formed on pretence of wiping out the stain of captivity; but the real design was to furnish a handle for new<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>modelling the kingdom, resuming the grants, and annulling the sales which had been made before the king's departure. He alledged that the purchasers had already profit enough by their bargains, which were detrimental to the crown; and that subjects ought never to make an advantage of their king's necessities. No body chose to dispute the justice of this resumption. Hugh, bishop of Durham, resigned the earldom of Northumberland; Godfrey, bishop of Winton, gave up the sheriffalty of Hampshire, the castle of Winchester, and the manors he had purchased before the expedition to Jerusalem; and all the other grantees and purchasers follow∣ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden. Dueto Col.</NOTE> their example. William, king of Scotland, chose this unseasonable juncture to sollicit a grant of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lan∣cashire, on pretence that these counties had been enjoyed by his ancestors; and, his petition being refused, he offered fifteen hundred marks for the coun∣ty of Northumberland alone. The king would have embraced the proposal, with a reservation of the castles; but William would not receive it on these
<PB N="400" REF="4090"/>
terms; and went away dissatisfied, tho' not before he had obtained a charter entitling him to a certain sum to defray his expences in coming up to attend<NOTE PLACE="marg">G N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>brig.</NOTE> the great council of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Richard, having received considerable sums from York and o∣ther cities, by way of free-gift and congratulation on his return, and persuaded the Cestertians to part with another shearing, resolved to visit his foreign do∣minions, and oppose the progress of the French king, who had invaded his ter∣ritories in concert with prince John and his rebellious subjects. He accord∣ingly embarked at Portsmouth with a strong body of forces in a fleet of one hundred ships, and landing at Barfleur, proceeded to his palace of Bures, near Bayeux. Next morning his brother John appeared in his presence, and throw∣ing himself at his feet, implored his majesty's pardon, which was granted at the intercession of the queen-mother; tho' no part of his estate was restored 'till the succeeding year, when he obtained the restitution of the counties of Mortaigne and Gloucester, with the honour of Eye, and an annuity of eight thou∣sand livres, in lieu of his other possessions. The king having appointed the ren∣dezvous of his troops at L'Aigle, went thither and advanced immediately to the relief of Vernueil, which was besieged by Philip, to whom he resolved to give battle. But that prince declined an engagement, and retired in the night with precipitation. The breaches were immediately repaired: he directed his march to Montmirail, which the Angevins had already taken and demolished: from thence he repaired to Tours, where he received a free gift of two thou∣sand marks from the citizens; and, marching forward to Loches, took the place by assault. The king of France proposed a conference, and the place was fixed; but, while the English commissioners waited for the French depu∣ties, Philip took the castle of Fontaines near Rouen, and in his retreat surpriz∣ed the earl of Leicester in the neighbourhood of Gournay: he afterwards burned the town of Evreux, and then made a motion to Fretteval. In this place Richard resolved to attack him, and advanced as far as Vendome; but, the French king not daring to stand the shock, retired in great confusion; so that he was overtaken and routed with great slaughter by Richard, and narrowly escaped with his life. All his baggage and treasure, his seal and portable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dueto Col.

<P>Immediately after this victory, the king marched with incredible ex∣pedition into Guienne, against the count of Engoulesme and Geoffrey de Rancone, lord of Pons, who had raised an insurrection in favour of Philip. In sixteen days, he reduced all their towns and castles, and the number of his prisoners amounted to three hundred knights, and forty thousand soldiers; so that the revolters were obliged to submit; and Philip sued for a truce of three years; but as Richard would not agree to such a long cessation, it was concluded for a shorter term,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1194. G. Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brig.</NOTE> to be in force from the latter end of July, to the feast of All-saints in the fol∣lowing year. The king of England employed this interval in regulating his re∣venue, which, he had reason to believe, was mismanaged and embezzled in his absence. The itinerant justices were directed to make a minute scrutiny into the demesnes of the crown, the lands of wards, escheats, and forfeitures, as also into the wealth of the Jews, who were obliged, on pain of forfeiture and impri∣sonment, to deliver true inventories of their estates; and all their pawns, bonds,
<PB N="401" REF="4100"/>
and securities were lodged in a public office, in order to prevent their frauds and exorbitant usury. The same scrutiny was carried on in his foreign dominions. The officers of his revenue in Anjou and Maine were severely fined for their misma∣nagement and corruption. William, bishop of Ely, was deprived of his office of chancellor, and a new great seal being made, all charters were renewed, and the fees produced a considerable sum of money. Though the pope had lent a deaf ear to the remonstrances which were made by the prelates and nobility against the legatine power of Longchamp; his holiness no sooner understood that he was in disgrace with the king, than he superseded his commission, and created Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, his legate over all the realm, notwithstanding the exemption which the late pope had granted to the church of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diceto.</NOTE> York.</P>

<P>Richard, on the very day of his deliverance at Mentz, had dis∣patched Salt de Breuil, with letters to Henry, king of Jerusalem, importing, that he would certainly return to the Holy-Land, before the expiration of the truce with Saladine; and as the war was chiefly carried on in that country with cavalry, he indulged his subjects with the practice of tournaments, which had been for some time forbidden in England; because he foresaw, that this exer∣cise would qualify them for the service of the campaign. These diversions had been prohibited in England and some other countries, on account of the mischiefs which they had produced; for exclusive of accidents, which often befel the combatants, individuals, who entertained private animosity against each other, took this opportunity of deciding the contention, and fought to extre∣mity, because no punishment was adjudged against him who flew his antagonist in the tournament: for, the law supposed that such death was the effect of acci∣dent. It was in an exercise of this kind, that Leopold, duke of Austria, sus∣tained a fall, in which his foot was crushed to pieces, a gangrene ensued, and he suffered amputation without success. Despairing of recovery, he desired he might be absolved of the sentence of excommunication, which the pope had fulminat∣ed against him, for his cruelty and injustice to the king of England. Before he could obtain this favour, he was obliged to release Richard of all conventions made during his captivity; he ordered the money, which he had received for his ransom, to be restored, and the English hostages to be set at liberty. His suc∣cessor was very unwilling to execute these bequests, and allowed his father's corpse to he a whole week unburied, before he would release the hostages: but the clergy refusing to perform the funeral rites, until these articles should be ful∣filled, he dismissed them at last, and made them a tender of four thousand marks to be restored to Richard: but they refused to charge themselves with such a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>During Richard's captivity, the emperor had offered to him the kingdom of Provence, and the countries about the Rhone, which had for∣merly been imperial fiefs, provided he would take the trouble to conquer them from France. Since that period, Henry had marched into Italy, and conquer∣ed Apuglia, Calabria, and Sicily, of which he was crowned king, in right of his wife Constance. Upon his return from this fortunate expedition, he formed a plan for re-uniting to his sway, all the kingdoms and provinces which
<PB N="402" REF="4110"/>
formerly held of the western empire; and, considering Richard as a necessary ally towards the execution of this project, he sent an embassy with the present of a golden crown to that prince, and the proposal of an offensive and de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensive league against Philip, who had provoked the king of England by divers in∣fractions of the truce, and even hired fifteen Saracens to take away his life. Richard had found very little benefit from the pensions he had paid to some German princes for their assistance against France, and was dubious of Henry's sincerity: but that he might not, on bare suspicion, avoid an advantageous al∣liance, he sent the bishop of Ely to found his real sentiments, and adjust the particulars of the treaty. Philip, discovering these transactions, endeavoured to intercept the bishop in his passage; but, failing in the attempt, he declared that this correspondence was a breach of the truce, which he therefore renounc∣ed; and made several incursions in Normandy, where he demolished divers castles, of which he had made himself master by treachery in the beginning of the war. Vaudreuil was on the point of undergoing the same fate, when Richard advanced with an army, and Philip, afraid of contending with him in the field, had recourse as usual to a mean stratagem: he amused the king of England with a conference, while his engineers were privately employed in un∣dermining the fortifications, which tumbled down all at once with a hideous crash. Richard, hearing the noise, was transported with indignation; he started up with fury in his aspect, and putting himself at the head of his troops, at∣tacked the French so suddenly, that they had scarcely time to retreat beyond the Seine. Philip was almost drowned, in passing a bridge which broke down with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>His progress was a little interrupted by the arrival of ambassa∣dors from the king of Castile, who having been routed, and afterwards be∣sieged in Toledo by a vast army of Moors, sollicited the assistance of the chris∣tian powers. Another negociation was begun, between France and England, and the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an of a treaty digested; but as Richard did not know the emperor's real sentiments, he postponed the conclusion of the peace, and, in the mean time, delivered up the princess Adelais, who was immediately married to the count of Ponthieu. The two kings agreed to a conference, in the neighbour∣hood of Verne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il; but Philip, instead of repairing to the place appointed, sent the archbishop of Rheims to amuse Richard, while the French troops took this opportunity of his being at a distance, to ravage part of Normandy, and burn the town of Dieppe, with all the shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the harbour.

and the treaty afterwards ratified at Louviers, in a numerous assembly, composed of the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms.

The limits of France and Normandy were marked by a line drawn from the Eure to the Seine.

<P>During these transactions, the abbot of Caen had found means to persuade the king, that great part of the revenue was embezzled by the officers of the crown: and that it might, by good oeconomy, be doubled without any grievance to the subject. He was accordingly sent over to England with a commission, empowering him to inspect the accounts of all concerned in the revenue; and orders were issued, for all sheriffs and officers to come at an ap∣pointed time with their accounts to London: but he died before the day, to the unspeakable satisfaction of those collectors; nor was his death much lament∣ed by Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, who, upon the abbot's arrival, had desired to resign his post, on account of his age and infirmities; and, at the death of that prelate, offered to retain his office of guardian of the realm. In order to efface the impressions which the abbot's suggestions had made upon Richard, he gave that prince to understand, that he had, in the two last years, remitted to him eleven hundred thousand marks out of England; and the king, struck with the greatness of the sum, was glad to leave the patrimony of the crown to the management of such a good oeconomist. Hubert indeed filled all his posts with dignity and prudence; though he took advantage of Geoffrey's absence to exercise his legatine power in the province of York, which was now deprived of its exemption by pope Celestine, who was incensed at Geoffrey for the little regard he expressed for the see of Rome. That prelate discountenanced all appeals to his holin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, slighted the papal decrees, and adhered to the old laws and customs of the realm. He had imprisoned and deprived several eccle∣siastics who made appeals, and obtained the pope's decrees in their favour. A dispute subsisting between him and his chapter, about the right of electing a dean, he had been summoned to appear at Rome, and answer some articles exhibited against him; and, neglecting this citation, was in disgrace; so that Hubert could not have found a more favourable juncture to exercise his legatine power over Geoffrey's province. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE></P>

<P>Howsoever the archbishop of Canterbury might have usurped in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He totally suppressed the dangerous gangs of robbers, who sheltered themselves in the large forests, that overspread the kingdom, and infested the whole country; but he found greater difficulties in quelling the tumults that arose between the rich and poor citizens of London. The populace was headed by a chief, called William Longbeard, who had been bred to the law; but being an idle, profligate vagabond, he renounced his pro∣fession, accused his elder brother of treason, because he refused to supply his extravagance; and having wriggled himself into the magistracy of London, af∣fected
<PB N="404" REF="4130"/>
to espouse the cause of the poor with uncommon zeal and seeming enthu∣siasm. He stiled himself their saviour; and even went over to Normandy, where he represented to the king, that the poorer sort of citizens were oppressed by an unequal assessment of the taxes, and obtained a mitigation. By these means he acquired a dangerous degree of popularity, and excited frequent tu∣mults against the wealthy Londoners, who were besieged in their houses, and even assaulted in churches. A proclamation was issued out against these distur∣bances; but by this time, above fifty thousand people had engaged in an asso∣ciation, to defend and obey William, who murdered his fellow-citizens with∣out remorse; and provided a great quantity of iron tools to force open the doors of their warehouses. Hubert, afraid of employing the civil power at once against s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a powerful conspiracy, convened a common-hall, and in a speech to the citizens, after having complained of the disorders daily committed within their precincts, and represented the dangerous consequences of such licence and irregu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arity, persuaded them to give hostages, as a proof of their peaceable in∣tention, which would convince the king of the falshood and malice of the re∣ports he had heard to their prejudice. He no sooner gained this point, than he summoned William to appear before the council, and answer to an accusation exhibited against him for murder and sedition; but he came with such a formi∣dable train, that the trial was postponed. Hubert afterwards sent two citizens, with a guard, to apprehend this desperado, who slew one of them, and fought his way with an halbert to the church of St. Mary le Bow, attended by his con∣cubine, and some of his accomplices, who had, by this time, murdered the other citizen. There he was supplied with arms and provisions, and expected to be joined by the populace; but these were intimidated on account of the hos∣tages they had given, as well as by a numerous body of well armed forces, by which the church was immediately invested. William still refusing to submit to a legal trial, Hubert ordered the soldiers to force the body of the church; so that he and his men were obliged to retire into the steeple, from whence he was driven by a smoke of wet straw kindled for the purpose. He was then taken, tried, convicted, and, being drawn at a horse's tail through the streets of London, was hung in chains, with nine of his accomplices. The lower class of people revered him as a martyr, and began to believe reports of his having wrought miracles. The gibbet was stolen as rivalling the cross in sanctity.

<P>Hubert, having quieted these disturbances, held a conference at York with William king of Scotland, in order to settle a marriage-contract which had been proposed between that king's eldest daughter Margaret, and Otho, younger son of Henry the Lion, whom, in consequence of this match, William intended to declare his successor. Earl Patric and the Scottish nobili∣ty opposed this settlement, and declared for the succession of Edward, earl of Huntingdon; alledging, that the crown of Scotland never descended to a daugh∣ter, when the king had a brother alive. William however was resolved upon
<PB N="405" REF="4140"/>
the match, and now stipulated with the archbishop, that Otho should immedi∣ately receive with his daughter the province of Lothian, and be put in possession of the counties of Northumberland and Carlisle by the king of England. But this treaty was broke off by the pregnancy of William's queen, who brought forth a son to inherit his dominions; and Richard, in order to console Otho for his disappointment, bestowed upon him the county of Poitiers, by way of ac∣knowledgment of the services he had done him during his captivity. About<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> this period the archbishop marched against Rees, prince of South Wales, who had burned Caermarthen, reduced several castles, and defeated Roger Mortimer and Hugh de Say, in a pitched battle. Hubert took the field in person at the head of a great army; but the Welch prince would not hazard a battle, so that he could do nothing effectual, but besiege the castle of Guenwynwyn, which at last surrendered upon an honourable capitulation; though Hubert no sooner re∣tired, than the Welch retook it on the same terms. Rees dying in the course of the succeeding year, a quarrel arose among his sons about the succession, and in∣volved the whole country in the miseries of a civil war, till Hubert finding an opportunity to seize Griffith the eldest, effected an accommodation to the satis∣faction of all parties. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gerv.

<P>Mean while Brittany became a scene of confusion. Constance had, after the death of Geoffrey, married Ralf Blundeville, earl of Chester, who had under the late king administered the affairs of that dutchy. He lived at variance with the princess, and his government was so odious to the Bretons, that they drove him out of the country, and he had retired to his estate in Normandy. The king, desirous of effecting a reconciliation between him and Constance, sent for this princess, who was surprised on the road by her husband, and con∣fined in his castle of S. James de Bevron. Richard claimed the guardianship of her son Arthur, now in the ninth year of his age; and certainly had the best title to that office, both as his uncle, and duke of Normandy, of which the dutchy of Brittany was a fief. But Constance, desirous of reserving to herself the charge of his education, recommended him to the protection of some lords who were in the French interest, who conveyed the young prince to S. Paul de Leon, in the Lower Brittany, and sollicited Philip's assistance. Against those noblemen Richard detached Murchadde with his Brabantins, and Stephen de Turnham, at the head of a body of forces raised in Poitou, Anjou, and Le∣maine, who were worsted in a battle fought near Carhaes, in the diocese of Cornouaille. Philip took this opportunity of Richard's being unfurnished of troops, to renew hostilities; and as the abbots of St. Denis, Marmoutier, and Cluny, with the prior of La Charité, had been his sureties for observing the peace, he was no sooner guilty of this infraction, than Richard seized the lands belong∣ing to those convents in England, until they should pay the penalty of fifteen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> thousand marks which they had forfeited. The French king invading Nor∣mandy at this juncture, met with very little opposition, and took Aumale with several other places, while Richard was obliged to act on the defensive, at the head of a small body, till towards the latter end of the campaign, when his af∣fairs assumed a more favourable aspect. The Bretons were fain to submit and give hostages for their fidelity: Constance, being enlarged, was entrusted with the guardianship of her son, after she had sworn to do nothing without the ad∣vice of the king of England; and the long quarrel between Richard and Rai∣mund,

<P>The peace of Guienne being thus secured, the king resolved to strengthen the frontiers of Normandy, and gave orders for erecting a fortress at Andely, through which the French had always found an easy entrance in their in∣cursions. The ground belonged to the see of Rouen, and Richard offered to make reasonable satisfaction to the archbishop; but that prelate, inflexibly de∣voted to the rights of the church, even when they clashed with the public good, rejected the equivalent, appealed to the pope, and laid all Normandy under an interdict. Richard sent agents to Rome to justify his conduct; and the cause being heard, his holiness decreed that Andely should be conveyed to the king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE> for lands of an equal value. In conformity with this decision, he granted to the see of Rouen, three towns and other possessions, to the amount of five hundred livres a year more than the revenue of Andely, the fortifications of which were completed; and this, together with the famous Chateau Gaillard erected at the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Coll.</NOTE> same time, served on that side as the bulwark of Normandy. As a dreadful dearth, and its attendant pestilence, prevailed over all the western parts of Eu∣rope, it was impracticable to bring great armies into the field; consequently the war was maintained in slight incursions. Richard, making an irruption into Picardy, took the town of St. Valery on the Somme, destroyed the castle, seized all the ships in the harbour, and among these, finding five corn English vessels, caused the masters to be hanged as traitors, for supplying the enemy with provision. The castle of Melly in Beauvoisis, was invested by John, count of Mortaign, and Marcaddee, general of the Brabantins; and being taken, was demolished. Peter de Dreux, bishop of Beauvais, and first cousin to the French king, advancing with a body of troops to its relief, fell into an ambush, was routed and taken prisoner. Richard ordered this insolent prelate to be closely confined at Rouen, and even fettered him as a mark of disgrace: and two of his clergy petitioning that he might be used with less severity, the king told them, that he treated the bishop in this manner, by way of retaliation for the repeated injuries he had done him in the east, and during his captivity; observing that, in consequence of Peter's admonitions to the emperor, he himself had been loaded with as many chains as an horse could carry. The bishop sollicited the pope to interceed with Richard in his behalf; but that pontiff de∣clined the office, because he had been taken in arms like a soldier; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

<P>As Philip had taken all occasions to retrench the privileges and crush the exorbitant power of the nobility, a spirit of discontent had diffused it∣self through some of the first families in France, and Richard did not fail to take the advantage of this dissatisfaction. Among these malecont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts the most powerful was Baldwin, count of Flanders and Hainault, a third part of whose territories had been seized by Philip, at the death of his predecessor. With him the king of England engaged in an offensive and defensive league against France, that should subsist for ever, and be obligatory on their descendants. Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hard immediately supplied the count w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th a sum of money, that enabled him to raise a strong body of forces, with which he reduced a number of fortresses, and at last invested Arras. Philip advancing to the relief of the place, the count
<PB N="407" REF="4160"/>
raised the siege, and retired before him, until the French king had penetrated a great way into the country, when he found that Baldwin had very artfully sent detachments to break down the bridges, open the sluices, and take possession of the passes in his rear, so that he could neither be supplied with provision, nor retreat without the most imminent danger. In this emergency, he proposed terms of accommodation to the count, reminding him of his duty as a vassal of France, recapitulated the loyalty and services of his ancestors, and promised to restore all he had taken from Flanders, if he would renounce his alliance with the king of England, the inveterate enemy of the French monarchy. Baldwin, thus cajoled, allowed him to retreat unmolested; but, being afraid of break∣ing with Richard, to whom he had given hostages for the performance of ar∣ticles, he acted the part of mediator, and persuaded the king of England to agree to a conference, at a place between Gaillon and Andely, where, though the two monarchs, mutually exasperated against each other, would not consent to a perfect reconciliation, the prelates and nobility, who bore the bur∣den of the war, interposed their authority so effectually, that a truce for one year was concluded, and the prisoners on both sides were released, for a reasonable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>By this time Richard perceived how little he could depend upon the count of Flanders; and his conduct, on this occasion, was not so much in∣fluenced by Baldwin's persuasions, as by the remonstrances of Hubert, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, whom he had sent for to the continent, to consult about the affairs of England. At that prelate's return, he issued a proclamation, fix∣ing the standard of the currency; and appointing one set of weights and mea∣sures to be used all over the kingdom, under severe penalties; at the same time certain regulations were made for the prevention of frauds in the woollen ma∣nufacture. Then he made a progress to the marches of Wales, changing the governors of the frontier castles; thence repairing to Coventry, he turned the secular canons out of the priory, and restored the monks, who had been ex∣pelled by Hugh Nonant, bishop of that diocese. While he thus exercised lega∣tine power, pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Celestine died, and his successor Innocent III. would never renew his commission. This pontif was prejudiced against the archbishop, by the insinu∣ation of the monks of Christ-church, who suspecting Hubert of a design against them similar to that of his predecessor Baldwin, represented him as an enemy to the papal authority. Innocent, alarmed at their suggestions, ordered them to demolish a chapel he had finished at Lambeth, and resign the post of chief jus∣ticiary, which by the canons was incompatible with the ecclesiastical character.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> In this office he was succeeded by Geoffrey Fitz-piers, who had been justice of the king's court, and inherited the barony of William de Mandeville, late earl of Essex. Under this new justiciary's administration, the assize of the forest was published, re-establishing the severe penalties of the game-laws enacted by Henry son of the conqueror; and a grievous talliage was exacted from the sub∣ject, at the rate of five shillings for every hide or hundred acres of land in the kingdom. This was the severest tax which had been imposed since the reign of William the conqueror; and falling upon the soccage tenants and farmers, pro∣duced great clamour and distress. Then the clergy were subjected to the im∣position; though at first they refused to submit to the authority of the general
<PB N="408" REF="4170"/>
council, but being deprived of the protection of the king's courts, and disabled from recovering debts and forfeitures, they at length consented to pay their proportion of the talliage. After this unpopular transaction Geoffrey marched into South Wales, to raise the siege of castle Payen, in Radnorshire, in which William de Braouse was invested by Gwenwynwyn, lord of Powis, whose kinsman Vaughan had been treacherously put to death by William's contrivance. Gwenwynwyn re∣jecting all overtures of peace, the justiciary set at liberty his professed enemy Griffith ap Rees, who raising his vassals and joining the English, a battle en∣sued, in which Gwenwynwyn was routed, above three thousand of his followers were slain, a great number of his men taken prisoners, and Geoffrey returned in<NOTE PLACE="marg">D ce: Coll.</NOTE> triumph to the capital.</P>

The cause of this competitor was espoused by the French king, who engaged in a league with him against Otho, Richard, the archbishop of Cologne, and the count of Flanders; while these, on the other hand, together with the duke of Louvain, the counts of Braine, Bou∣logne, Guisnes, Perche, Blois, and Tholouse, entered into a confederacy against France, and mutually promised upon oath to reject all terms of peace, except<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> with the common consent of the association.</P>

<P>The truce with Philip was no sooner expired than Baldwin, count of Flanders, invaded Artois, and took St. Omer, while the French king ra∣vaged the frontiers of Normandy, and ordered all his prisoners to be deprived of their eye-sight; a barbarous practice, which provoked Richard to a re∣taliation. The two kings had now taken the field, inspired with personal animosity against each other, and at length they met between Gamages and Vernon. They engaged immediately with great fury on both sides; but vic∣tory soon declared for Richard, who routed his adversary, and pursued him to the very gates of Vernon, from whence he retired to Mante, in order to re∣cruit his forces. The victor improved his advantage by the reduction of seve∣ral castles, and at length took Courcelles by assault: but the French king being ignorant of this event, and having by this time reasssmbled a numerous army, resolved to attempt the relief of that important fortress. For this purpose he began his march from Mante, with four hundred knights, a thousand esquires on horseback, and a large body of militia; but when he had advanced to the neighbourhood of Courcelles, he was attacked by Richard, and, being again de∣feated, fled in great disorder to Gisors. In crossing the river Epte, the bridge being overloaded by the number of fugitives that crouded after him, broke down, and a great number of people, including twenty knights, perished by it's fall; the king himself narrowly escaping with his life. This accident cutting off the retreat of the French forces, they were almost all killed or taken; and among the prisoners were Matthew de Montmorency, Alan de Boussy, and Fulk de Gilerval, whom Richard unhorsed and took by his own personal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brompton.

<P>In consequence of this victory, Marcaddee, with his Brabantins, made an incursion into Picardy, as far as Abbe Ville, where he found an im∣mense booty, and took a number of merchants, who paid large sums for their ransome. Richard erected the fortress of Boutavant in an island of the Seine, and Philip, raising a new army, burned the town of Evreux, and seven villages, in the neighbourhood. Tired, however, of an unsuccessful war, he made over∣tures of peace, and offered very advantageous terms to Richard, who could expect no advantage from hostilities; he sollicited the pope's interposition to∣wards an accommodation between him and the king of England; and Innocent knowing the Christians of the Holy Land could not be effectually relieved, while the war between the two crowns continued, readily complied with his re∣quest, and sent Peter, cardinal of Capua, as his legate to mediate a reconcilia∣tion. Though Richard loudly complained, that the pope had refused to excom∣municate the king of France for having seized his territories, while he was en∣gaged in the crusade, he was pleased with an opportunity to oblige that pon∣tiff, whom he wanted to engage in the interest of his nephew Otho, and con∣sented to the legate's preposal of an interview with Philip. They met between Vernon and Andely, Richard appearing in a boat, and the French king sitting on horseback, on the bank of the river. Here they agreed to accept the me∣diation of the pope, and fixed the time and place for another conference, in presence of the cardinal, prelates, and nobility, of both nations. At this se∣cond meeting they concluded a truce for five years, and the troops on both sides were dismissed. Marcaddee, in marching with his Brabantins to his quarters, was attacked by four French noblemen, at the head of a strong body of forces, and several of his people were slain. Richard, confiding in the truce, had repaired to Guienne, and Philip, taking the advantage of his absence, erect∣ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Richard was not a prince to put up with these indignities: he returned forthwith to Normandy, and sent his chancellor Eustace, bishop of Ely, to demand satisfaction, and declare that he would hold the truce as dissolved, unless Philip would order the new castle to be immediately demolished. The French king disavowed the injury done to the Brabantins, and promised to dismantle the fortress; but Richard insisted upon a final discussion of all disputes. Several conferences were held, and at last both parties signified their approbation of a plan of pacification, proposing that the king of England should give his niece Blanche, of Castile, in marriage to Philip's eldest son Lewis, together with Gisors and twenty thousand marks of silver; that all the other places taken from Richard should be re∣stored; that as an indemnification for Gisors, Philip should convey to the king of England, the right of nomination to the archbishopric of Tours; and that the king of France should promise upon oath to assist Otho with all his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth.

Upon this occasion the French king, with a view to sow the seeds of discord in the royal family of England, gave Richard to understand, that his brother John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad courted his protection in private, and devoted himself en∣tirely to the service of France: in order to confirm the truth of this allegation, he produced a letter in John's own hand-writing, which in all probability he had received in the course of their former correspondence. Richard, giving way
<PB N="410" REF="4190"/>
to the first transport of his passion, ordered his brother's lands to be sequestred, without examining into the truth of the accusation; and John, being informed of the charge, sent two knights to the court of France to defend his innocence, either in court or combat. Philip declined the challenge, and Richard being convinced of John's innocence, re-admitted him farther into his favour than he had ever advanced before; because he had hitherto doubted his fidelity, and even sign fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that doubt, when he pardoned him at the desire of his mother.</P>

After he had de∣spaired of his recovery, he was visited by the archb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop of Rouen, who assum∣ing the privi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege of a gho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y director, exhorted him to put away his three daughters, namely, price, coveto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness, and luxury. Richard replied, with great good humour, that he bequeathed his pride to the Knights Templars; his covetousness to the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans; and his luxury to the prelates. The castle of Chalus being taken, he ordered Bertram de Gourdon, who had shot the arrow, to be brought into his presence, and asked, what injury he had done him, that he should take away his life? The other answered, with great deliberation, that he had, with his own hand, sla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his father and two brothers, and that he should suffer chearfully all the torments which could be inflicted, since he had been the instrument of providence that delivered the world of such a tyrant, who had filled it with blood and carn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge.

The king having settled the concerns of his soul, and given directions about his funeral, expired on the sixth day of April, in the forty∣second year of his age, and the tenth of his reign, leaving only one natural son, called Philip, to whom he had given the castle and honour of Cognac in Guienne; and this son r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venged his father's death by slaying the viscount of L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>moges.

<P>This renowned prince was tall, strong, straight, and well-proportioned. His arms were remarkably long, his eyes blue and full of vivacity. His hair was of a yellowish colour, his countenance fair and comely, and his air majestic. He was endued with a good natural understanding; his penetration was uncom∣mon;
<PB N="411" REF="4200"/>
he possessed a fund of manly eloquence; his conversation was spirited; and he was admired for his talent at repartee. As for his courage and ability in war, both Europe and Asia resounded with his praise. The Saracens stilled their children with the terror of his name; and Saladine, who was an accom∣plished prince, admired his valour to such a degree of enthusiasm, that immedi∣ately after Richard had defeated him on the plains of Joppa, he sent him a couple of fine Arabian horses in token of his esteem; a polite compliment, which Richard returned with magnificent presents. Those are the shining parts of his character, which, however, cannot dazzle the judicious observer so much, but that he may perceive a number of blemishes, which no historian has been able to efface from the memory of this celebrated monarch. His ingrati∣tude and want of filial affection are unpardonable. He was proud, haughty, ambitious, choleric, cruel, vindictive, and debauched. Nothing could equal his rapaciousness, but his profusion; and indeed the one was the effect of the other: he was a tyrant to his wife, as well as to his people, who groaned un∣der his taxations to such a degree, that even the glory of his victories did not exempt him from their execrations: in a word, he has been aptly compared to a lion, a species of animals which he resembled, not only in his courage, but likewise in his ferocity.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE will that Richard made in favour of John to the prejudice of the heir of blood, and so contradictory to his declaration and treaty of Messina, was, in all probability, a sacrifice to the sollicitation of his mo∣ther Eleanor, who could not bear the thoughts of seeing her influence eclipsed by Constance of Brittany, which would have been the case had Arthur suc∣ceeded to his uncle: she had already made her own stipulations with John; and her affections declared for her own son, who had been bred under her eye, rather than in favour of a stranger with whose person she was hardly acquaint∣ed. Arthur was but just turned of twe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve at his uncle's decease. He lived under the tuition of his mother Constance, who, being weak, passionate, and indiscreet, had found it impracticable to form any party in his behalf. Her conduct was so imprudent, that she forfeited the esteem of all those who might have befriended her family. She was suspected of an amorous intercourse with John, and her husband Ralf, earl of Chester, having obtained a d vorce on<NOTE PLACE="marg">I eland. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oveden.</NOTE> that account, she married Guy, a younger brother of the viscount de Thouars. Hered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tary right had been often set aside in England both under the Saxon and Norman government; therefore the people could not be greatly shocked at the ex∣clusion of young Arthur, a foreigner, whom they had never seen, in favour of prince John, who had been educated among them, and who had already se∣cured the greatest men of the kingdom in his interest.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' nobody would espouse the cause of Arthur in England, he was not so little regarded in all the other dominions that belonged to Richard. Thomas de Furnes delivered to him the town and castle of Angers: All the pre∣lates and nobility of Anjou, Touraine and Maine, acknowledged Arthur as their liege lord, and, by an act of their assembly, established him in possession of the go∣vernment. Constance thought proper to put him under the protection of Phi∣lip, king of France, who garrisoned all his towns and castles, sent the young prince to be educated with his son Lewis at Paris; and, without any regard to the truce, invaded Normandy, which he wasted with fire and sword. Mean while John,
<PB N="414" REF="4230"/>
upon his brother's decease, repaired to Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, where the treasure was deposited, and this was immediately delivered by the governor, Robert de Turnham, to∣gether with all the fortresses in his custody. This important step being taken, he dispatched Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and William Mareschal to Eng∣land, to concert measures for securing his succession in that kingdom, with Geoffre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fitzpiers the chief justiciary, and the other noblemen whose interest he<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vet.</NOTE> had bespoke, while he himself staid in Normandy to manage the affairs of his foreign dom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions. The town of Le Mans having recognized the title of Ar∣thur, John advanced with his forces against that city, which, together with the castle, he reduced, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed the walls in terrorem; thus impoliticly dismant∣ling the best frontier town in his dominions. After this exploit, he returned to Rouen, where he was invested with the sword and ducal coronet of Normandy, by the archbishop of that capital, who administred to him the oath usually taken on such occasions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>While John was thus employed on the continent, his two deputies with Geoffrey Fitzpiers, exerted themselves for his interest in England, where they exacted the oath of fealty in his behalf from all citizens, burghers, corporations, and military tenants of the crown: but, at the same time, the prelates and no∣blemen ret red to their cast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which they fortified and supplied, as if they had resolved to maintain their own independency, or, at least, disown the authority of John Lackland count of Mortain Whether they had already formed the design of ascertaining their liberty against the encroachment of the crown's prero∣gative, or dreaded the resentment and vindictive disposition of John, whose trea∣sonable practices they had formerly opposed; certain it is they kept aloof from the justiciary and his confederates, and, had Arthur been in the kingdom, would, in all probability, have supported his title. Hubert and his colleagues perceiving the necessity of removing their doubts and scruples, summoned them to an assembly at Northampton, where they assured them of John's favour and pro∣tection, and expatiated so eloquently upon his generosity and munificence, which were proved by the grants of man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, wardships, and beneficial offices, that they were all won over to his interest, and took the oath of fealty on certain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet.</NOTE> conditions which they stipulated for their own security. At the same time they prevailed with David, earl of Huntingdon, to go and pacify his brother Wil∣liam, king of Scotland, whose envoys they had stopped in their way to John with a demand of Cumb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rland and Northumberland. They assured him that, although they could not allow his deputies to pass, before he had taken the oath of fealty to the new king, they would use all their interest for his satisfaction, if he would wait 'till John's arrival, without raising any disturbances in the mean time.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>He had no opportunity of exercising his patience on that subject; for John, understanding that the way was paved for his peaceable accession to the throne, embarked immediately for England with a strong body of forces, that he might be prepared for all events, and landing at Shoreham, proceeded directly to London. Next day he was crowned at Westminster by Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, in a full assembly of the prelates, earls and barons, and took the accustomary oath to maintain the peace of the church and the peo∣ple; to restrain rapine and other iniquities, and to be governed by equity and mercy in all his decisions. After the ceremony of his coronation, he conferred
<PB N="415" REF="4240"/>
the post of chancellor on archbishop Hubert; William Mareschal and Geoffrey Fitz-piers were invested with the sword, as earls of Pembroke and Essex: in a few days, William de Ferrers was created earl of Derby; Roger de Lacy re∣ceived the castle and honour of Pontefract; and other barons were favoured with distinctions of honour and advantage. The envoys of William king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cart. Antiq.</NOTE> Scotland were amused with general promises of doing justice to their master, whom he invited to his court; and, in hope of an interview with that prince, he repaired to Nottingham. From thence he sent the bishop of Durham to Ber∣wick with his compliments of invitation to William, who, instead of accompa∣nying the prelate to the place of John's residence, gave him to understand, that he expected a compliance with his demand in forty days; otherwise he would do himself justice. In cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence of this declaration the counties of Northum∣berland and Cumberland, with all the castles, were committed to the charge of William d'Estouteville, a great baron of the north, supposed very capable of defending them from invasion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>This precaution being taken for the maintenance of the public peace, John returned to Normandy and assembled an army at Rouen to defend his domi∣nions against the attempts of Philip, who proposed a truce, and both parties agreed to hold a conference during this interval for the determination of all their differences. In the mean time Baldwin, count of Flanders, repaired to Rouen, where he renewed the alliance he had made with Richard, and did homage for the continuance of his pension. He was followed by the other French allies whom the late king had engaged in his interest, to the number of fifteen counts or noblemen, who now visited king John, and their subsidies being paid, swore they would never hearken to an accommodation without his consent; while he, on the other hand, promised upon oath, that he would never conclude a treaty with France in which they should not be included. At the same time he received letters from Otho, desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing he would not make a precipitate peace with Philip, as his affairs began to take a more favourable turn, and he should in a little time be able to assist him with the whole force of the empire. Queen Eleanor, after Richard's death, had done homage to the king of France at Tours for the dutchy of Gui∣enne, of which she then took possession by a previous agreement with her surviving son; but John had never performed the duty of a vassal for Nor∣mandy, nor hinted the least intention of acknowledging the superiority of the French king; an omission which Philip resented so highly, that when the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. de Monte. Rigord. de Philip. Gest.</NOTE> kings met near Gaillon at the conference, he did not behave to the king of England with his usual politeness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and was moreover very unreasonable in his demands. For he insisted upon John's ceding all the Vexin Normand to him∣self, and all Guienne, Anjou, Touraine and Maine, to prince Arthur; conditions which were rejected with disdain. Had John possessed his brother's talents for war, he could not have found a more favourable juncture for distressing Philip, who was at this time greatly perplexed in consequence of a quarrel with pope Innocent. The French king had, in a skirmish near Lens, taken Philip count of Namur, and Peter de Corbeil, bishop elect of Cambray. This last having been preceptor to Innocent, that pontiff sollicited his release, which, however, the king of France refused, on pretence that the pope had not interposed in be∣half of the bishop of Beauvais, who still remained a prisoner in Normandy. The pope's legate laid France and that dutchy under an interdict until both
<PB N="416" REF="4250"/>
prelates should be set at liberty; and when they were exchanged for one ano∣ther, this sentence was removed. But Philip ran the risk of another sentence of this kind, and even of excommunication, in consequence of his divorce from the Danish princess, and his subsequent marriage with Mary, daughter of Ber∣thold duke of Meranie, which were both declared null, tho' Mary had born a daughter, and was now pregnant with a son, whom the father alterwards legi∣timated. Innocent ordered him to put away this princess, and take back Ingel∣burga, on pain of being excommunicated and seeing his kingdom laid under an interdict; and this last sentence was actually pronounced by a council as∣sembled at Vienne in Dauphine. Philip was extremely chagrined at this cen∣sure; and those who obeyed it, whether ecclesiastics or la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, were treated with great severity: but, in spite of all his endeavours, it had such an effect upon his subjects, and he was so apprehensive of an excommunication, that he submit∣ted to the pope's order, renounced his latter marriage, and took Ingelburga again to wife, in a public council held at Nesle by two cardinals delegated for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigord.</NOTE> determining this affair.</P>

<P>The conference between the kings of France and England having proved ineffectual, Philip invaded Normandy, reduced Conches, and then marching into Le Maine dismantled Ballon, one of the strongest fortresses of that country. William de Roches, hereditary seneschal of the dutchy, and general of Arthur's forces, complained of this demolition as an injury to the young prince, and was answered in a haughty manner by Philip, who advanced immediately to the siege of Lavardin. The seneschal, apprehensive of this fort's being treated in the same manner, and plainly perceiving that the French king acted only for his own interest, resolved to effect an accommodation be∣tween Arthur and his uncle, to whom he made very acceptable overtures. John immediately marched to the relief of Lavardin with such an army, that Philip thought proper to raise the siege and retire with precipitation. William had found means to conduct Arthur privately from Paris to Le Mans, which he now delivered up to the king of England; and John, having this capital, together with his nephew and Constance, in his power, sent for Aimery, vis∣count of Thouars, whom he compelled to give up Chinon, of which he was go∣vernor, and resign the post of seneschal of Anjou. Such infractions of the treaty just concluded, could not fail to alarm Constance, who, receiving private inti∣mation that John intended to seize the person of Arthur, retired in the night to Angers with that young prince, the viscount de Thouars, and a great num∣ber<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.</NOTE> of adherents.</P>

<P>Mean while Peter of Capua, the pope's legate, prevailed upon the kings of France and England to conclude a truce, in hope of adjusting the ar∣ticles of a treaty before it should expire. During this cessation, Philip de∣tached Baldwin, count of Flanders, from the interest of John; and the French nobility who were pensioners to the English monarch, despairing of success, made their submission to Philip. This defection, added to the dread of Arthur and the advice of Eleanor, disposed the king of England to a pacification, and Philip, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the terror of the interdict, was in all respects as peaceably in∣clined. With these favourable dispositions, they met between Gaillon and An∣dely, where the conferences were opened, and they soon agreed to a peace on the following conditions: That Evreux should be ceded to France, and the boun∣daries
<PB N="417" REF="4260"/>
be fixed between that city and Neubourg; that the fortifications of Portes and Landes should be demolished; so that there should be no castles left be∣tween Andely and Gamaches: that John should bestow his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iece Blanche, daughter of Alfonso king of Castile, in marriage upon Lewis prince of France, together with Yssoudun, Grassay, Chateauroux; all the fiefs he claimed in Berry, to be put into his hands immediately and enjoyed during life, whether the marriage should or should not be consummated: but, failing issue by Blanche, they should revert to John or his heirs at the death of Lewis; that if John should die without children, the fiefs of Hugh de Gournay, the counts of Aumale and Perche should devolve to Lewis; the king of England should hold of the crown of France, all the dominions on the continent possessed by his predecessors, except the Vexin Normand and the above-mentioned alie∣nations; that he should pay to Philip, the sum of twenty thousand marks for his relief, and the fiefs of Brittany; that Arthur should do homage for this dutchy to John; and that the king of England should grant no aid or assist∣ance in money or troops, to his nephew Otho, without the consent of Philip. The counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Engoulesme, wfith the viscount of Li∣moges, were included in this treaty, which was guaranteed by the nobility of France, England, and Normandy, who swore to take arms against the vio∣lator of these articles. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>In consequence of this treaty, by which John reaped no advantage, but Philip's promise of abandoning the interest of Arthur, Eleanor, in spite of the infirmities of old age, and the severity of the winter season, set out for Castile, and conducting Blanche as far as Fontevrault, committed her to the care of Elias, archbishop of Bourdeaux, who attended her to Rouen; and, immediately after the ratification of the treaty, she was married to Lewis at Portmort near Andely, in the Norman territories, because the interdict still con∣tinued in France. The ceremony being performed, the young princess was conveyed to Paris for her education: John swore fealty to Philip, as lord para∣mount of Normandy, and he himself received the homage of Arthur, for the dutchy of Bretagne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet.</NOTE></P>

<P>In the interval between the agreement and ratification of the treaty, John had come over to England, where, by his own authority, he laid a tax of three shillings a hyde for raising the money he had promised to pay to Philip; and, after having taken this arbitrary measure, he returned to Normandy, from whence, after the establishment of the peace, he marched into Guienne, where he received the homage of Aimery de Thouars, whom Eleanor had gained over to his interest; and the oath of fealty from the counts of Tholouse, Engoulesme, La Marche, Limoges, and all the barons of the country. But his right to this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> dutchy was contested by Otho, who had claimed Guienne and the earldom of York, by virtue of a grant from the late king, and being provoked at the peace with France, sent his brother Henry, duke of Saxony, to take possession of those fiefs, and demand the legacy bequeathed to him by Richard. John rejected both his demands, and pleaded conscience in defence of injustice, by saying that he had restricted himself by oath from assisting Otho, either with money, jewels, lands, or men; a subterfuge, in all probability, suggested by Philip, whom he now consulted on all occasions.</P>

<P>Not but that he sometimes acted from the sudden impulse of his own un∣ruly passions, which, at this period, hurried him into an act of injustice and in∣discretion, that was attended with very troublesome consequences. Isabel, daugh∣ter of Aymar Taillefer, count of Angoulesme, was affianced to Hugh le Brun, count of La Marche; and John, chancing to see the young lady in this expedi∣tion, was so captivated with her beauty, that he demanded her in marriage of her father, who yielding his consent to such an advantageous match, renounced his treaty with the count of La Marche, from whose custody he conveyed his daughter to Engoulesme. John had been long tired of his own wife, and re∣solved to procure a divorce from her, on account of her barrenness; in pursu∣ance of this resolution, he had sent the bishop of Lisieux, and three English noblemen, as ambassadors, to demand the daughter of the king of Portugal in marriage: but now, without paying the least regard to his honour or his in∣terest, he obtained the sentence of divorce from the archbishop of Bourdeaux, assisted by the bishops of Poitiers and Saintes, and was, by the first of these pre∣lates, married to Isabel of Engoulesme. This precipitate marriage incensed the king of Portugal to such a degree, that the safety of the ambassadors was endangered: the pope took umbrage at a match founded upon a divorce which he had not been sollicited to confirm; and the count of La Marche, being rob∣bed of a princess who had captivated his affection, was so enraged at the injury and disappointment, that he devoted his whole attention to revenge, and had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<P>The king of England, in his return from this expedition, visited An∣gers, where he exacted one hundred and fifty hostages from the citizens; and then repaired to England with his fair bride, who was crowned at Westminster, by Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, who had lately held a synod in that place contrary to the orders of the justiciary, and enacted several canons for the refor∣mation of abuses, which had crept into the administration of ecclesiastical affairs. Each of those new regulations concluded with a salvo of the honour and privi∣leges of the church of Rome; a form that Hubert seems to have adopted to ingratiate himself with pope Innocent, who was a pontiff of great resolution and abilities, calculated for extending the papal authority. After having kindled the enthusiasm of the people by the sermons of his emissaries, he, on pretence of re∣lieving the christians of the Holy Land, laid a tax of the fortieth part of all ec∣clesiastical revenues in Italy, Sclavonia, Germany, France, and the British isles, for the maintenance of a new crusade to be undertaken against the Saracens; and sent Philip, a Roman notary, to collect this imposition in England. While the pope thus exercised his power over the clergy, he did not fail to exhort the laity to make a voluntary contribution for the same laudable purpose. The king of France raised the same proportion in his territories; and John not only granted the fortieth part of his revenue for one year, but also authorised the same col∣lection<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.

<P>Immediately after the new queen's coronation, John, who was ex∣tremely desirous of accommodating matters with William, king of Scotland, that, instead of a dangerous enemy, he might become a useful ally, sent a splen∣did deputation of noblemen, to invite that prince to his court at Lincoln, where he proposed to receive his homage. The Scot obeyed the summons, and
<PB N="419" REF="4280"/>
arriving with Roland, lord of Galloway, did homage to John in public upon Bre∣hill, swearing on the cross of archbishop Hubert, that he would be his liegeman, and bear faith to him, of life, limb, and terrene honour against all men, saving the rights of his own crown. This ceremony of submission was, in all probabi∣lity, performed for the counties of Lothian and Galloway, which had formerly belonged to the Cumbrian kingdom, as William, at this time, possessed no fiefs in England; for his claim to the northern counties was not yet admitted, but the examination of that affair postponed to another opportunity, so that the Scottish king retired, not a little dissatisfied, to his own dominions. John had the less to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Heniers. Hoveden. Rad. Niger. Trivet.</NOTE> apprehend from his resentment, as a reconciliation was now effected between him and his natural brother Geoffrey, whom he had disseized of his temporalities, on a supposition that he carried on a correspondence with William, to the prejudice of his government. Having made a progress through the northern counties, he kept his Christmas with great festivity at Guilford, and repaired at Easter to Canterbury, where, in imitation of the ancient kings, he and his queen were crowned at that festival in the cathedral by Hubert, assisted with the bishops of Dublin, London, Rochester, Ely and Norwich. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Diceto.

<P>While John thus revelled in feasting, and the delights of his new marriage, the bad effects of that alliance began to appear in Guienne, where a commotion was raised by the count of La Marche, and his brother Ralf de Yssou∣dun, possessed of the county of Eu in Normandy. John, apprised of these distur∣bances, dispatched orders to Guerin de Glapion, seneschal of Normandy, to ra∣vage Ralf's possessions, and besiege the castle of Dreincourt, which was accord∣ingly invested; but the siege was raised by the king of France, who marched with an army to its relief. The king of England, alarmed at the interposition of Philip, summoned the earls and barons of England to meet him at Portsmouth, well provided with arms and horses, to serve him on the continent: but the no∣bility, sick of those expeditions, in which neither the honour nor interest of their country was concerned, and understanding moreover that the present disturbance was the effect of John's tyranny and oppression, they assembled at Leicester, in order to deliberate upon the king's command, and considering the present service as a grievance and invasion of their privileges, unanimously agreed to refuse attending him, unless he would restore their antient rights. Neverthe∣less, as they had projected no plan of conduct, and chose no chief to command and direct their confederacy, this resolution produced very little effect. John, being informed of their purpose, ordered them to deliver up their fortresses. William de Albiny, the first nobleman to whom he intimated this demand, compounded for his castle of Belvoir, by giving up his son as an hostage; and the rest were excused from this expedition upon paying a certain scutage for every knight's fee, and promising to keep the peace of the kingdom. The earl of Pembroke and the constable of Chester, were sent over to the continent in the mean time, with two hundred men at arms, to repress the revolters: Hubert de Burgh, the king's chamberlain, was left to guard the marches of Wales with a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The first step he took upon his landing, was to appoint a conference with Philip near Andely, where that monarch entered into a friendly expostula∣tion with him, upon the grievances of the barons in Guienne, who had been
<PB N="420" REF="4290"/>
oppressed by John's officers; and some of them, having lost their castles and ap∣plied in vain for redress, appealed to Philip as lord paramount of their fiefs, and received his protection. His remonstrance seemed to make an impression upon John, who promised to do them justice; and he accompanied Philip to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained: from thence he repaired to Chinon, where he was visited by the queen dowager Berengaria, to whom he assigned, in lieu of dower, the city of Bayeux, two castles in Anjou, and an annuity of a thousand marks. He was now at the head of a sufficient force to suppress the insurrection in Guienne, and appease the troubles of that country; but, instead of going thither, he returned to Normandy, and left Robert de Turnham, to re∣duce the revolters. As he discovered no inclination to satisfy the barons, they again complained to the king of France, who reminded him of his promise, and insisted upon doing justice to his vassals, otherwise he should be obliged to es∣pouse their quarrel in a more effectual manner. John renewed his promises, but, instead of indulging the barons with a fair hearing, he sent among them a num∣ber of profligate miscreants, noted for strength and agility, who professed them∣selves his champions, and offered to decide the dispute by duel, according to the practice of the times. The count of La Marche and his brother rejected the challenge, because those champions were not their peers, and appealed from such determination once more to Philip, who sent a very severe reproof, mixed with menaces, to the king of England, reproaching him with perfidy and injustice. John protested, that he would immediately hold a court of barons at An∣gers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Brito. Hoveden.</NOTE> for the redress of the injured, and that, if they would come to London, they should be provided with letters of safe conduct: nevertheless, he still found new pretences to evade his promise.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1202.</NOTE> Arthur, upon the death of his mother Constance, which happened in the course of this year at Nantes, had repaired from Paris to Rennes, in order to take possession of Brittany, and receive the homage of the nobility. He like∣wise supported the complaints of the barons of Guienne, and demanded justice of Philip, with regard to his own pretentions touching that fief, as well as Nor∣mandy and Anjou. The king of France, incensed at the little regard which had been paid to his remonstrances, actually prepared to support the complainants with force of arms; and John, alarmed at his design, not only repeated his assu∣rances of immediate redress, but agreed to surrender the castles of Tillieres and Boutavant, as pledges of his sincerity. When Philip appeared before these fortresses, the governors ordered the gates to be shut against him, declaring they had not received any orders to give them up; and the French king, exaspe∣rated at such a series of collusion, resolved to commence hostilities without de∣lay. John begged a conference in the isle of Goulet near Andely, where the French king insisting upon his ceding the provinces holding of France to prince Arthur, or finding security that he would stand to the award of the French court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diceto. Col. Paris. Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> to which he had been already called; John, whose pride was equal to his indo∣lence, rejected the proposal, and the conference breaking up, summoned Ar∣thur to come and do homage for Brittany.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The king of France immediately invested Tillieres and Boutavant, which he reduced, with divers other castles, and then sat down before Gournay, situated on the river Epte, and counted one of the strongest places on the fron∣tiers of Normandy. Philip, having little hope of reducing it in the usual way of
<PB N="421" REF="4300"/>
carrying on approaches, contrived an expedient which succeeded to his wish. He broke down the banks of a large pool in the higher ground, and the water rushed down upon the castle with such impetuosity, that the garrison and inhabi∣tants were fain to save their lives by a precipitate flight; so that when the tor∣rent subsided, Philip took possession of the town, where he knighted Arthur, now in the sixteenth year of his age, conferred upon him the investiture of Brittany, Guienne, and Anjou, and gave him his daughter Mary, yet an infant, in mar∣riage. The young prince, ambitious of approving himself worthy of these marks of distinction, was furnished with a sum of money and two hundred knights, to attack Guienne; and hearing, as he passed through Poitou, that queen Eleanor was in the castle of Mireleau, he marched thither and took it by assault, his grandmother retiring into a tower, from whence she found means to make John acquainted with her distress. Roused from his sloth at this intelli∣gence, he flew to her relief at the head of his Brabantins, and surrounded Ar∣thur's small body, before they had the least intimation of his approach: they had been reinforced by a small party of Poitevin barons, and too confident of their own bravery, resolved to engage the Brabantins in the open plain. For this purpose, they came forth and attacked John's forces with the utmost intrepidity; but, after a very obstinate and bloody action, they were obliged to yield to the numbers of the enemy, who not only repulsed them to the castle, but entered with the fugitives; and there the battle was renewed with great fury, till at length prince Arthur was totally defeated and taken prisoner, with Hugh count of La Marche, Geoffrey de Lusignan, Andrew de Chavigny, the viscount de Chatillerault, Savary de Maubon, and several other barons, and above two hundred knights. Philip, informed of this disaster, abandoned the siege of Arques, and marched directly to the Loire, in order to support the weakened party of Arthur; there having reduced the city of Tours, he set the houses on fire, levelled the walls, and dismantled the castle, while John, contenting him∣self with his victory, returned to Rouen, and relapsed into his former indolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Marga. M. Paris. Rob. de Monte.</NOTE> which, that he might be able to indulge, he, in a little time, executed a scheme of barbarity, which no person, endued with humanity, can hear related without horror. Instead of improving his victory in the field by activity and address, he set at liberty the count of La Marche, and Geoffrey de Lusignan, the two per∣sons from whose activity and resentment he had every thing to fear, even though they delivered their castles into his hands; the rest of his prisoners he sent to England, where they were close confined in different castles, and many of the bravest among them famished to death: as for Arthur, he was conveyed to the castle of Falaise, where John is said to have visited him in person, and endea∣voured to detach him from the king of France; instead of gaining his point, he was treated by the young prince with ineffable disdain, upbraided as a tyrant and usurper, and menaced with the vengeance of Philip and his allies. This beha∣viour could not be well brooked by a prince of John's disposition; and, in all probability, extinguished any sentiments of respect which he might have enter∣tained for the person of Arthur. He was importuned by the king of France and the nobles of Brittany, to release this prisoner: he dreaded his talents, his title, and his revenge; and thus actuated, resolved to deprive him of his life. He is said to have sent an order for putting out the eyes of this unhappy prince, and rendering him incapable of propagation; but Hubert de Burgh, constable of
<PB N="422" REF="4310"/>
the castle, instead of obeying such a cruel command, gave out that he was dead, and the bells tolled for his supposed death all over Normandy. The Bre∣tons, taking for granted that he was murdered, vowed revenge and eternal en∣mity against John; and such a clamour was raised through all his dominions on the continent, that Hubert, in order to prevent mischief, discovered that he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad. Niger.</NOTE> alive. A prince endowed with common policy, would have learned from this specimen of the people's sentiments, how dangerous it would be to make any attempt upon the life of Arthur; but John, instead of being cautioned by this experiment, ordered him to be removed from Falaise to the castle of Rouen, where he was inhumanly put to death; though the circumstances of this cruel<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>3.</NOTE> tragedy, are not certainly known. John is said to have pressed William de Bray, to assassinate the young prince; and that officer answering, he was a gen∣tleman and not an executioner, he tampered with others, who rejected the office in the same manner, and at last resolved to sacrifice the victim with his own hands. He accordingly went in the night by water, to the tower of Rouen, ordered Arthur to be brought into the boat, thrust his sword several times through his body, which was sunk, with an heavy stone, in the river; from which it was afterwards dragged ashore in the net of a fisherman, and interred in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann Marga. Gul. Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the priory of Notre Dame du Pré, without the knowledge of the tyrant. Be this as it may, the youth all at once disappeared; and his uncle industriously cir∣culated a report of his having perished in the river, in attempting to make his escape. All the world believed that the young prince was murdered by his con∣trivance; and what seemed to justify that supposition, was its being committed two or three days after the death of his mother Eleanor, during whose life he durst not have executed such a barbarous design; besides, he, at this period, made an hasty voyage to England, and was crowned at Canterbury, as if, con∣scious of the murder, he thought that ceremony would consecrate him anew, and purify him from the guilt. On this occasion, he carried along with him Arthur's sister Eleanor, now heiress of Brittany, therefore surnamed La Brette, who inheriting her brother's title to the crown, was now become the object of John's jealousy, and close confined at Bristol, under the guard of four knights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gdale.</NOTE> that she might have no opportunity of engaging in a clandestine marriage.</P>

<P>The perpetration of this horrid murder, not only rendered the ty∣rant detestable in the eyes of all mankind, but was the immediate cause of Brit∣tany's being for ever dismembred from the English crown. John, in conse∣quence of his nephew's death, demanded the administration of that dutchy, as guardian of Eleanor, who was then in his power: but the states of the province received his proposal with horror; and, far from complying with his demand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they appointed Guy de Thouars, the last husband of Constance, the chief of their council of government, and guardian to his infant daughter Alice, whom they proposed to acknowledge as their dutchess, provided her elder sister Eleanor could not be delivered from captivity. They strongly sollicited the release of this princess; and finding their remonstrances disregarded, in an assembly at Vannes, drew up articles of impeachment against John, whom they accused of murder and parricide, lodging their accusation in the court of peers of France, and deputing the bishop of Rennes, and Richard de Mareschal, to carry on the process. John was accordingly summoned to vindicate himself from the charge, and failing to appear, condemned by the unanimous sentence of the peers,
<PB N="423" REF="4320"/>
couched in these terms; <Q>“Whereas John, duke of Normandy, forgetting his oath to king Philip his lord, has murdered his elder brother's son, an homager of the crown of France, and the king's kinsman, and perpetrated the crime within the signiory of France; he is found guilty of felony and treason, and adjudged to forfeit all the territories which he holds by homage.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Hoz.

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Philip was extremely incensed against the author of such a cruel tragedy, which he determined in earnest to revenge. He assembled a body of troops, and marching towards Anjou, almost all the barons of that province and Poitou, revolting from John, put themselves under his protection: the tyrant had already been abandoned by several noblemen of approved fidelity, who would no longer serve such an infamous master. Juhael de Mayenne, a power∣ful lord in Bretagne, left him immediately after the murder, and joined his coun∣trymen in the prosecution; and William de Roches, seneschal of Maine and Anjou, deserted him on the same occasion, and took Angers by surprise: in a word, the defection became general, and John, giving way once more to his brutal disposition, ordered all their hostages to be put to death in the fury of revenge. Philip having, with the assistance of the Bretons and Poitevins, redu∣ced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet.</NOTE> a number of fortresses beyond the Loire, and on the borders of Normandy, dismissed his forces; and John seized this opportunity to invest Alençon, which the count had put into the hands of the French king. When he had made some progress in the siege, Philip, understanding there was a vast concourse of knights at a tournament in the neighbourhood of Moret, went thither, and persuaded them to march to the relief of Alençon; they were glad of such an opportunity to signalize their courage, and advanced with such expedition, that John raised the siege and retired with great precipitation, leaving his machines, tents, and baggage to the enemy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The victor then turned his arms against Normandy, in which he took several fortresses, and was admitted into others; and about the middle of August, he undertook the siege of Chateau Gaillard, on the banks of the Seine, built by Richard, and supposed impregnable. John, though at the head of an army equal in number to the French, was afraid of hazarding a battle, partly from cowardice, the consequence of his guilt, and partly from a suspicion of his soldiers. He had solicited the pope's mediation, and his holiness sent two abbots to negociate a peace. These deputies, by virtue of the papal authority and injunctions, commanded both princes to assemble their prelates and nobility, in order to adjust the articles of a pacification, and to repair the churches and monasteries, which had been demolished in the course of the war between the two kingdoms. Philip dispatched some of his prelates to Rome, where they represented John in such colours, that Innocent was prevailed upon to suspend his interposition in the quarrel; and the king of England, having nothing far∣ther to expect from his holiness, resolved at length to make an effort to throw supplies into the castle of Gaillard. For this purpose, he detached the earl of Pembroke, with a strong body of horse and foot, to attack and amuse the be∣siegers, while a fleet of seventy flat-bottomed vessels, loaded with provision and ammunition, and manned with three thousand Flemings, was rowed up the river, to destroy a bridge of boats formed by the French, and succour the be∣sieged. The scheme was well laid; but, this armament moving slowly against wind and tide, the earl of Pembroke arrived at the scene of action, long before
<PB N="424" REF="4330"/>
it reached the bridge; and attacking the enemy's camp in the night, filled it with disorder and consternation. His Brabantins, however, were more intent upon plunder, than desirous of improving the advantage they had gained, and the French perceiving them dispersed and busy in pillaging the camp, rallied and charged them with such vigour, that they were immediately routed, and fled in great confusion. The fleet did not appear till day light, when the whole force of the French, being united against its efforts, the commander found it im∣practicable, either to demolish the bridge, or throw supplies into the place, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>This was the last attempt that John made for the defence of his fo∣reign dominions: while Philip blocked up the castle of Gaillard, took Andely, and even reduced Radepont, an important place in the neighbourhood of Rouen, the king of England indulged himself in riot and sloth, saying, when re∣minded of Philip's progress, "Let him proceed; I shall recover more in one "day, than he can conquer in a whole twelvemonth." Such was his indo∣lence and seeming tranquillity, in this alarming situation, that people could not help believing he was bewitched: and the English nobility at his court, fore∣seeing nothing but disgrace and danger, as the result of this infatuated beha∣viour, desired leave to visit England, from whence they promised, in a little time, to return. He would not, however, put them to that unnecessary trouble; for, after having dismantled several strong towns, so as to lay the country open<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Ann. Wav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</NOTE> to the incursions of the enemy, he ordered four ships to be privately prepared for his passage, and quitting Normandy, set sail for England. Philip did not fail to improve his opportunity; he now extended his conquests without opposition; for the Normans considered John's departure as a renunciation of the dutchy to the lord paramount: besides, they were incensed at his leaving the command to Arches Martin, and Lupecaire, two of his Brabantin chiefs, under whom the Norman nobility disdained to serve upon any principle. Though all the Vexin frontier, and a great number of places were reduced by the French king, Cha∣teau-Gaillard still held out, through the courage and conduct of Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester, who commanded the garrison. At length Philip, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣credible labour, filled up a hollow way between this castle and an opposite rock, so that he could bring his machines to act against the walls; and, at the same time, he employed a great number of miners to sap the foundation. These en∣deavours succeeded; the fort was taken after a siege of six months, and the governor made prisoner, with the remains of his garrison, by this time reduced below two hundred fighting men. Philip treated him with great respect, for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The French king having reduced this important fortress, resolved to be∣siege Falaise, the bulwark of lower Normandy; but, before he had begun to open his batteries, Lupecaire the governor surrendered the town and castle, and, with his Brabantins, entered into the service of France. All the other places in that part of the country submitted without opposition; while Guy de Thouars, with a numerous army of Bretons, invaded Normandy on the other side, reduced castles and com∣mitted terrible ravages. John, though he had not spirit enough to oppose the French king in his conquests, was so nettled at this incursion, that he equipped an ar∣mament
<PB N="425" REF="4340"/>
of English, who made a descent upon Brittany in Guy's absence, took several towns, pillaged the country, and, at the approach of Thouars, with a rein∣forcement of French troops, re-embarked at Cancale with a considerable booty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad. Niger.</NOTE> The whole dutchy of Normandy was now subdued, except Vernueil, Arques, and Rouen, which engaged in a league for their mutual defence. Rouen, the capital, was the first of the three which Philip invested; it was a strong popu∣lous city, and extremely averse to the French government. When the king of France appeared with his army, the populace massacred some of his subjects who happened to be in the place; when they were summoned to surrender, they declared they would defend themselves to the last extremity, and immediately sent deputies to England to sollicit assistance. John had, by an embassy to the court of France, sued for peace, which Philip would not grant on any other con∣dition, than that of his giving Eleanor in marriage to his younger son, together with all the dominions that he held of the crown of France. Such terms the king of England would not embrace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the negociation proved fruitless, and he had resigned all thoughts of defending Normandy; so that he desired the deputies of Rouen to surrender upon the best terms they could obtain. Notwithstanding this permission, the inhabitants still continued to act bravely in their own defence, until the Barbacan, a fort that covered the bridge, being taken, they agreed with Philip to deliver up the city, if peace should not be made before the end of the month. As this was not the case, they and the other two associated cities, took the benefit of the capitulation, and Normandy was re-united to the kingdom of France, after a separation of two hundred and ninety-two years. Philip likewise compleated the conquest of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, ex∣cept the castle of Chinon, which was gallantly defended by Hubert de Burgh, till the ensuing summer, when he was taken in the place, after having been<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigord.

<P>Mean while, John seemed utterly insensible of the damage and disgrace which he incurred by the rapid progress of the French king. He gave himself up to the enjoyment of his young wife; and seemed to renounce all ac∣tive measures, except those of confiscating the English estates of the Norman barons, who had submitted to the king of France. He likewise consoled him∣self with the gratification of his personal animosity towards John de Courcy, the conqueror, and lord of Ulster, who had refused to do him homage, and openly accused him of murder and usurpation. Walter de Lacy and his brother Hugh, were directed to seize the person of this nobleman; and as they were unable to reduce him by open force, they had recourse to stratagem. Walter invited him to a conference, and fell suddenly upon him with a body of troops prepared for the purpose; so that after the greatest part of his retinue was slain, he took shel∣ter in Hugh's castle, into which he was decoyed by the most warm professions of friendship. Here, however, Hugh detained him, until John's followers ravaged the lands of the Lacys in such a manner, that they were obliged to set him at liberty. After his release, he defeated them in a pitched battle; but they re∣solved to effect by treachery, what they could not obtain by valour. They cor∣rupted the integrity of his people, who seized him on Good Friday, while he was employed at his devotion in church, and being delivered to Hugh, he was brought over to England, and committed close prisoner to the Tower; while Lacy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoveden.

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>King John affected to complain loudly of the noblemen who had left him at Rouen, as if their retreat had occasioned the loss of Normandy; and, on this pretence, extorted from them a seventh part of their moveables: he likewise contrived means for laying imposts on the convents and parish churches; and assembled a great council at Oxford, in order to deliberate upon measures for retrieving his dominions on the continent. To defray the expence of this expedition, a scutage was charged upon the nobles and military tenants; nor were the prelates and clergy exempted from this burthen. But these aids were<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> employed in supplying his own extravagance. During these transactions, Ro∣bert de Turnham, and Savary de Mauleon, struggled manfully in Poitou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1205.</NOTE> again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the other barons supported by Philip, until Poitiers was reduced, Robert taken prisoner, the castle of Loches obliged to surrender, and the whole pro∣vince in the most imminent danger of b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing totally subdued. In this extremity, the few barons, that still adhered to his interest in that county, sollicited imme∣diate succour; and John equipped a powerful armament, with a view to cross the sea in person. He had already repaired to Portsmouth in order to embark, when the archbishop of Canterbury represented the indiscretion of trusting his person among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickle Poitevins; and of leaving his kingdom defenceless, at a junc∣ture when a descent was threatened by the duke of Louvaine and the count of Boulogne, supported by the king of France. He lent a deaf ear to their re∣monstrances, and they entreated him on their knees to relinquish, or at least postpone the expedition: but finding him still inflexible, they changed their strain, and plainly threatened to detain him by force, rather than the country should be exposed to ruin by his departure. This menace had an instantaneous effect: he forthwith promised to be ruled by their advice; which was to send his brother William Longuepeé, earl of Salisbury, with a strong body of forces to the assistance of the Poitevins. He accordingly dismissed great part of his troops and vessels; and repaired to Winchester: but repenting of the step he had taken, he returned to Portsmouth, and immediately embarked. However, his disposition being more fickle than the weather, he landed near Wareham, in Dor∣setshire; and of this attempt made a handle to squeeze large sums of money from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1206.</NOTE> Guy de Thouars, governor of Brittany, growing jealous of the power of Philip, who had not only conquered the adjoining provinces, but also formed a strong party among the Bretons, began to wish that John was re-esta∣blished in the dominions he had lost, so as to form a ballance against the exor∣bitant power of the French monarch, and confirm Guy's own authority in Bre∣tagne, which was at this time very precarious. He had conferred on this sub∣ject with his brother Aimery, viscount of Thouars, whom Philip had created sene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal of the province; and he assenting to Guy's proposal, they formed a small association of barons, who entertained the same sentiments, and invited John to come over and take possession. A treaty was immediately concluded, and John embarking with a great army at Portsmouth, landed at Rochelle, where he was joined by the two brothers and their forces. But, instead of re∣ducing Brittany to his obedience, he marched directly towards Montauban, in Querc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, belonging to his brother-in-law the count of Tholouse, who had sided with Philip, and, investing the place, took it by assault: on which occasion the
<PB N="427" REF="4360"/>
English are said to have behaved with incredible valour, and this was amply re∣warded by an immense booty, and a vast number of prisoners of the first quality. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>Philip had, upon receiving intimation of John's treaty with Guy de Thouars, invaded Brittany, taken Nantes, and compelled the governor of the province to submit: but immediately after his return from this expedition, be∣ing informed of John's arrival at Rochelle, he directed his march into Poitou, when hearing the English army was employed in the siege of Montauban, he fortified Mirebeau, Loudun, and some other places, and then retreated towards Paris. After the reduction of Montauban, John advanced to Angers, which he took and reduced to ashes, after having ravaged all the adjoining country: then he undertook the siege of Nantes; but abandoned the enterprize, and pe∣netrated into Thouars, in order to protect Aimery from Philip's resentment. While he lay encamped on this territory, the French king advanced to give him∣battle; but John, instead of hazarding an engagement, sent deputies with pro∣posals of peace; both princes agreed to a conference, and in the mean time, John retreated with his army to Rochelle, where he embarked for England. Notwith∣standing this affront offered to Philip, the pope, whose mediation the king of Eng∣land<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Brito. Hist. de Bret. Rob. de Monte Rymer.</NOTE> had sollicited, employed an abbot so effectually, that the French monarch agreed to a truce for two years, in hope of being able to adjust the articles of a treaty, during that cessation of hostilities.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>But John, instead of improving this interval, either in negociation, or preparing for a vigorous war, relapsed into his former idleness, and seemed wholly to forget that he was at variance with any of his neighbours. Never∣theless, when the truce expired, the English troops surprised the strong castle of Guerplic, conveniently situated on the coast of North Bretagne, for protect∣ing troops in landing or embarking: but this place was soon retaken, by Ju∣hael de Mayenne, seneschal of Brittany, and the count of S. Pol, who had marched with a reinforcement of French troops to the assistance of the Bretons. Mean while Philip, with another army, entered Poitou, where he reduced seve∣ral towns and castles, and Henry Clement, his mareschal, in a rencounter with John's party, took Hugh de Thouars, Henry de Luzignan, and several other Poitevin barons in the English interest. This would have proved an irrepa∣rable blow, had not pope Innocent again interposed his good offices for another truce, which was accordingly concluded. The pope, notwithstanding his quar∣tel with John, was very desirous of effecting a durable peace between the two crowns; that the French might not be diverted from the prosecution of a war<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch 1207.</NOTE> which he had kindled against the Albigenses, in Languedoc, and sanctified with the name of a crusade.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever inconvenience attended a war on the continent, it was so far agreeable to John, as it afforded pretences to raise heavy exactions from his subjects, with which he gratified his own avarice and extravagance. At his return from Poitou, he assembled a general council, in which the prelates and nobility granted him a subsidy, amounting to a thirteenth of all rents and moveables throughout the nation; and this was levied from the tenants of the clergy, as well as from the laity. Geoffrey, archbishop of York, instead of submitting to this impo∣sition, not only refused to pay his proportion; but also excommunicated all per∣sons who should collect such a grievous tax upon the possessions of the clergy
<PB N="428" REF="4370"/>
in his province, and all invaders of ecclesiastical effects; and then withdrew from the kingdom. Notwithstanding this censure and pretext, the talliage was actually levied, and Geoffrey's moveables confiscated for his presumptuous behaviour; but the metropolitans remonstrated so warmly against this expedient of raising<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> money, as an intolerable grievance unknown in former ages, that John was prevailed upon to remit the whole exaction.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>John's character was so irregular and unsettled, that his conduct could not be consistent or uniform. He was by turns frightened into compli∣ance, and provoked into the most obstinate opposition. This period gave birth to his quarrel with the pope, which involved himself and the nation in such ca∣lamities. Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, dying at his palace, the younger monks of Christ-church, assembling that very night, chose Reginald, their sub-prior, for his successor, sung Te Deum, and placed him upon the archie∣piscopal throne. This new elect set out before morning, with some of the monks, for Rome, where he hoped to be confirmed; and all concerned in the clandestine election took an oath of secrecy, on which their success was supposed to depend. Reginald, without regarding this obligation, no sooner arrived on the continent than giving way to the dictates of vanity, he promulgated his elevation, as well as the intent of his journey; and, when he arrived at Rome, Innocent refused to confirm him, until he should be better informed of the affair. Mean while he sent a bull to the suffragans of Canterbury, desiring they would not create a dispute on this subject with the convent of Christ-church; and when they insisted upon their right of electing the archbishop, he heard the cause before his own tribunal, and declared the right of election vested in the convent alone. Mean while the monks concerned in Reginald's election, were incensed at his folly, in divulging the secret, and, as the whole order had not been convened for the ceremony, they now united in setting him aside, and ap∣plying to the king for leave to proceed to another election. John granted their request without subjecting them to any restriction; but gave them to under∣stand in private, that he should be extremely pleased if their choice should fall upon John de Grey, bishop of Norwich, who was accordingly elected in all the forms, approved by his majesty, and put in possession of the temporalities of the archbishop. Twelve of the monks were deputed to Rome for his confirmation, which, however, the suffragans opposed, because he had been elevated without their concurrence. Innocent, whose aim was to subject the church of England to the papal authority, that he might govern and tax it without controul, took this opportunity of annulling both elections, and of preferring a prelate, whom he knew devoted to his design.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>This pontiff had already, on pretence of relieving the Christians in the Holy-Land, laid a tax upon the English church, which being levied without murmurs, he was encouraged to exert the same power for his own pri∣vate advantage. With this view he had, during the vacancy of the metropo∣litan see, sent John Ferentino, as his legate, into England, and a national synod was called at St. Alban's; though a royal mandate put a stop to their proceed∣ings: but while John was abroad in Guienne, the legate convoked another at Reading, where he laid an imposition on the clergy, amounting to a consider∣able sum, with which he made his retreat before the king's return. This was such an agreeable sample of what might be drawn from England, that Inno∣cent
<PB N="429" REF="4380"/>
resolved to fill the vacant archbishopric with one of his own creatures, who would support his authority. He therefore recommended to the deputies of the convent, Stephen Langton, a Roman cardinal of English descent, though bred in Paris; and when the monks observed, that their commission did not extend to an election, which indeed they durst not undertake, without the king's con∣sent, and express powers from their convent; the pope over-ruled all their ob∣jections, and commanded them to chuse Langton, on pain of excommunica∣tion. Thus threatened, eleven of the number complied; and Stephen was con∣secrated by Innocent at Viterbo.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The ceremony being performed, the pope wrote a courtly letter of recommendation in his favour to the king, whom he presented with a few bau∣bles to avert his indignation: at the same time, the monks of Christ-church were enjoined upon their obedience to receive Langton, as their archbishop; and other letters were written to the chief nobility, solliciting their good offices with the king, in behalf of that prelate. All these precautions were insufficient to appease the wrath of John, who forthwith sent a body of troops to expel the monks of Canterbury, and hang them should they refuse to quit the king∣dom immediately. They were obliged to embark for Flanders, without delay; their effects were seized, their tenants ejected, and their place supplied with some monks belonging to the abbey of St. Augustine. In answer to the pope's letter, John gave him to understand, that he was determined to maintain the honour of his crown, and support the election of the bishop of Norwich; and that if his holiness should thwart him in this particular, he would suffer no ap∣peals in ecclesiastical disputes to be carried before any foreign court of judica∣ture. Innocent, far from being intimidated by these menaces, sent or∣ders to the bishops of London, Worcester, and Ely, to exhort the king, in his name, to receive archbishop Langton, and recall the monks of Christ-church; and, in case of his refusal, to lay the kingdom under an interdict. John was terrified by the declaration of these prelates, and offered to obey the pope's order, with a salvo of his rights, dignity, and prerogative: but Innocent would hear of no salvos, or other terms, than his delivery of the regalia, with his own hand, to archbishop Langton, and his making immediate and full restitution to the convent. The king rejected his proposal, and the three prelates having laid the kingdom under an interdict, retired to the continent, whither they were followed by the bishops of Bath and Hereford. A stop was immediately put to divine service, and the administration of all the sacraments but baptism: church doors were shut, and the dead buried in ditches and high-ways, with∣out the usual rites or any funeral solemnity. Notwithstanding this interdict, the Cistertian order continued to perform divine service publicly: the censure<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Waver. Mat. Paris. Ann. Eccl. Wigorn.</NOTE> was slighted by the bishops of Winchester and Norwich: some of the parochial clergy still officiated, and several learned divines preached against the injustice of the pope's proceedings.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>John was equally enraged and terrified at the prospect of being ex∣communicated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1208.</NOTE> by name, and seeing his subjects absolved of their allegiance. He ordered all the prelates, clergy, and their abettors, who observed the inter∣dict, to leave the kingdom, and seized their lands and revenues; though this order was soon revoked: he sent armed troops to all the nobility, whom he
<PB N="430" REF="4390"/>
suspected of disaffection, to demand their children or relations, as hostages for their fidelity; and they generally complied with his demand: but when those officers re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aired to the habitation of William de Braouse, lord of Brecknock∣shire, on the same errand, his wife resolutely told them, she would never trust her children in the hands of a man who had so basely murdered his own nephew and rightful sovereign. John was so provoked at this stinging re∣proach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat Paris.</NOTE> that he sent another body of forces to seize the person of William, who fled into Ireland with his wife and family. The king, in pursuance of his scheme for preventing an insurrection in England, in case the pope should put his threats in execution, resolved to compromise all disputes with William, king of Scotland, that the rebels might find no assistance in that kingdom. The Scots being in possession of Berwick, which was the key or pass to England, had some time ago committed depredations in Northumberland; and the English, in order to prevent these inroads, had, at divers times, attempted to erect a fortress on their own side of the river, at Twedemouth; but the work was twice inter∣rupted by the Scots, who surprised the guards, and demolished the fortification. William not only countenanced these outrages, but afforded shelter in his domi∣nions<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9.</NOTE> to the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econtents of England. John therefore made some overtures of accommodation, and, these being rejected, marched at the head of a great ar∣my to do himself justice by force of ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; the Scot posted himself at Roxburgh to cover his dominions from insult: but neither side being much inclined to a battle, they renewed the negociation, and a peace was concluded, on condition, that the unfinished castle of Twedemouth should be demolished; that John's sons, Henry and Richard, should espouse Margaret and Isabel, the daughters of William, who were immediately delivered to the king of England, to be educated at his court, together with fifteen thousand marks by way of portion; and that the fealty and homage due to the English monarch, for the lands which the Scottish king possessed in England, should, for the future, be paid by the prince of Scotland. In consequence of this agreement, William made a for∣mal resignation of those lands to John, who bestowed the investiture of them upon young Alexander; and that prince did him homage at Alnewick. The king of England, at this period, exacted the same oath and submission from all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ford<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>John seemed to think this new submission of his subjects, entitled him to a despotic power in his government: for he deprived his nobles of their favourite diversions, by issuing a severe prohibition against hunting, hawking, and fowling; ordered all the mounds of his forests to be levelled, and the ditches to be filled up, that his deer might have free liberty to range about, and eat up the corn and fruits of the husbandman; and a woman being killed by accident at Ox∣ford, he granted a warrant to arrest, and imprisoned three innocent clergymen, who were afterwards hanged without any form of trial: an act of oppression, in consequence of which three thousand students immediately quitted Oxford, so that the place was almost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>totally abandoned. Such outrageous acts of tyranny would have been highly impolitic at any time; but they seemed to be the effect of absolute frenzy at this juncture, when the sentence of excommunication hung over his head, and his people were on the brink of being absolved from their
<PB N="431" REF="4400"/>
allegiance. He had sent the abbot of Beaulieu, a convent of Cistercians, which he had lately founded in Hampshire, as his embassador, to Rome, to avert the pope's indignation, and accommodate all differences with the Roman see; and Innocent had given instructions to the bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester, to settle the terms of pacification. These prelates came over to England by virtue of a safe conduct, and John appointed some bishops and no∣blemen to treat with them at Can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erbury. The articles were soon adjusted and signed by the deputies on both sides: but John objecting to that, which obliged him to restore all that had been taken from ecclesiastics, the three prelates re∣fused to admit of any alteration, and retired to the continent. The king endea∣voured to negotiate a more favourable treaty with Langton himself, who, ar∣riving at Dover, was met by Geoffrey Fitzpiers and other noblemen, with pro∣posals from John, which he absolutely rejected, and left the kingdom immedi∣ately. He was afterwards invited to return, with promise of full satisfaction; but he refused the invitation; and the three bishops, delegated by the pope for this purpose, denounced the sentence of excommunication against the person of John, king of England. It was published in France; but, though several English bishops and abbots were enjoined to promulgate the censure in all conventical churches throughout the kingdom, no prelate or clergyman would venture to obey the order. Geoffrey, archdeacon of Norwich, and one of the barons of the Exchequer, observing to his colleagues, that it was unsafe for be∣neficed persons to continue in the service of an excommunicated prince, retired from the bench; but, John, being informed of his declaration, ordered him to be apprehended, imprisoned, and loaded with a leaden cope, the intolerable weight of which is said to have put an end to his life. Hugh, archdeacon of Wells, being preferred to the see of Lincoln, and having obtained leave to go abroad, and receive consecration from the archbishop of Rouen, went directly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Mailr. Ann. Wav. Mat. Paris.</NOTE> to the abbey of Pontigny, where he was consecrated by Stephen Langton, to whom he made profession of canonical obedience. John immediately seized his revenue, and gave his post of chancellor to Walter de Grey, and, as the censure was not yet published, proceeded with the utmost severity against all those, who paid the least regard either to that or the interdict. The nobility seem to have approved of his measures; for a fuller assembly was never known, than that which attended his court when he passed the Christmas holidays at Windsor. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>It was on this occasion, that he exacted vast sums, on pretence of making an attempt to recover Normandy; and of settling the affairs of Ire∣land, which were now in great confusion. How willing soever the laity might have been to grant subsidies, the clergy were certainly fleeced by dint of violence and extortion: without imposing a regular tax, he exacted money, by way of composition, from monasteries, canons, templars, and hospitallers; and the Jews were oppressed with great cruelty. By means of these extraordinary aids, he raised a great army, with which he embarked at Wales for Ireland, and landed safely at Dublin, where he received the homage of above twenty Irish lords, who went thither to meet and offer him their voluntary allegiance: but as Ca∣thol, king of Connaught, refused to submit, he marched against that prince, and reduced his whole country. In order to civilize the people, he established the laws of England throughout the nation, and appointed proper judges to see them put
<PB N="432" REF="4410"/>
in execution. John Grey, bishop of Norwich, was created justiciary, and or∣dered the money to be new coined of the same value with that of England, for the convenience of carrying on a traffic between the kingdoms. These measures being taken, John advanced against Lacy, earl of Ulster, and his brother Wal∣ter, who had protected William de Braouse when he fled into Ireland; their castles were reduced, and themselves compelled to quit the kingdom; William<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ann Marga.

<P>John, having regulated the affairs of Ireland, returned to Eng∣land, and convoking an assembly of all the abbots and chiefs of religious orders through the kingdom, extorted from them above an hundred thousand pounds sterling. The Cistercians, pleading t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir priviledge, and refusing to pay their proportion, he fleeced to such a degree, that almost all their houses were redu∣ced to beggary, except the convent of Beaulieu in Hampshire, which he him∣self had founded, as an act of penance for the murder of Arthur, and that of Margam in Glamorganshire, where he had been sumptuously entertained in his way to Ireland, and at his return; these were exempted from the impositions: but all the other Cistercians were not only impoverished, but debarred all cor∣respondence with their order abroad. Indeed an embargo was laid upon the ship∣ping in all the ports of England, to prev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt an intercourse of persons between<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 1211.</NOTE> this kingdom and the continent, without an immediate licence: and a procla∣mation was published, requiring all English bishops and ecclesiastics, residing in foreign parts, to return at a certain time, otherwise their benefices would be seized for the king's use; the prohibition was likewise renewed, against all ex∣ercise of the papal authority in England, on pain of corporal punishment. Not contented with setting the pope at defiance, and the contributions he had already received, he laid another talliage on the clergy, to defray the expence of an ex∣pedition against the Welsh, who had made some incursions over the English borders. He accordingly assembled a numerous army at Oswestre, and advan∣cing along the sea coast as far as Conway, burned Bangor, and committed such ravages in the country, that Llewellen, prince of North Wales, who had re∣tired with his people, cattle, and effects, into the mountains of Snowdun in Caer∣narvonshire, seeing his country des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late, sent his wife Jane, the king's own na∣tural daughter, to sue for peace, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich was granted, on condition of his paying twenty thousand head of cattle, forty horses, delivering hostages, and doing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

William, king of Scotland, whose son Alexander, now fourteen years of age, attended him to London, where the king knighted him at Clerkenwell; and, at the same time, received the homage of Alan, lord of Galloway, for a large tract of country, given to that nobleman in the north of Ireland. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.</NOTE></P>

<P>The pope, incensed at John's rejecting the proposals of peace, which had been offered by his nuncios, and paying very little regard to the pro∣mises he made by the mouths of his deputies, issued a bull, absolving all his subjects from the oath of allegiance, and ordering all persons to avoid him, on pain of excommunication: at the same time he wrote letters to the king of Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, and other princes on the continent, to fall upon his territories, and dis∣tress him as an enemy to the church. Among others, he exhorted Llewellyn, prince of north Wales, to invade England; absolved him from the homage he had lately taken, and released his country from the interdict which it had hitherto under∣gone in common with this kingdom. The Welsh prince, who could not brook the loss of Flintshire and Denbig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire, which he had ceded at the last peace, was glad of this opportunity to oblige himself and his holiness; and engaging in an association with the other princes and barons, fell upon the English marches with great fury, taking castles, massacring garrisons, burning towns, and ravag∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>John, being informed of these hostilities, marched into Wales, and Llewellyn retired at his approach; having demolished a castle or two that were not worth keeping, he returned to Nottingham, where, receiving a more circumstantial detail of the barbarities committed by the Welsh prince, he ordered all the hostages, consisting of the principal Welsh nobility, to be put to death, to the number of thirty. His revenge being still unsatisfied with this cruel sacrifice, he resolved to exterminate the whole race of the antient Britons, and had actually concerted measures for the expedition, when the king of Scot∣land gave h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m notice of a dangerous conspiracy formed against his life; and he received an intimation of the same nature from his natural daughter, who had married Llewellyn. Alarmed at this intelligence, he shut himself up in the castle of Nottingham, and, for a whole fortnight, suffered none to approach his person; but his fears subsiding, he resumed his enterprize, and advanced as far as Chester, where he received other letters of intimation, importing that, if he should p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oceed farther, he would be certainly assassinated by his own nobles, or betrayed to the enemy: here too he first understood, that his vassals and subjects were absolved from their allegiance; and these concurring tidings terrified him to such a degree, that he dismissed his forces and returned to London. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>He had no reason to expect extraordinary proofs of attachment from his nobility, who generally despised his character, and abhorred his admi∣nistration. He ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> debauched their wives and daughters, impoverished them by taxes, seized their estates, and insulted their persons: he had even ventured to make a general inquisition into the demesnes of the crown, as possessed by his predecessors: an odious measure at all times; but extremely alarming in the reign of such a tyrant as John, who they knew would seize the least flaw or defect in their titles, as a pretence for depriving them of their fortunes; so that he was at once the object of their terror and contempt Wanting nothing but an opportu∣nity to shake off his yoke, they were rejoiced at the censures passed against him by the pope, who they imagined would pursue his blow, and send an army to their

Had Simon de Montfort compleated the reduction of that people, in all probabi∣lity the pope would have sent that renowned general, with his victorious forces, into England; but, as the war in Languedoc was still unfinished, the English nobility, impatient of delay, entered into an association against John; and by an authentic deed, signed and sealed by every individual of the confederacy, in∣vited Philip, king of France, to come over, and receive the crown of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>John, being apprized of this conspiracy, without knowing the particular persons concerned in it, exacted hostages from all the nobility he sus∣pected, and by means of these, made himself master of their castles. Stephen Ridel, late keeper of the great feal, was banished, and Geoffrey de Norwich, one of John's own chaplains, confined to close prison, where he died; Robert Fitzwalter, whose daughter the king is said to have poisoned, because she would not submit to his embraces, fled into France, and Eustace de Vesci, his accom∣plice in the plot, retired into Scotland. John seized their lands, and sent their knights, as well as those belonging to the exiled prelates, to assist his friends in Poi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou; and from those who chose to stay at home, he extorted a composition: he demolished Robert's castles, and destroyed his woods in Essex; and became so timorous, that he never stirred abroad without a body guard of foreign bow∣men, hired for the defence of his person. Influenced by this apprehension, he endeavoured to conciliate the affection of his people by some popular regulations. He made a severe enquiry into the conduct of high sheriffs, who had embezzled great part of the public revenue. Some were imprisoned, some were fined, and others fled to avoid prosecution: he set on foot an examination into the beha∣viour of the foresters, who had committed flagrant acts of oppression: the fines they had imposed were remitted; and they promised upon oath, to exact no more than what was usually paid in the reign of Henry II: a tax laid upon the sea ports, which had produced great clamour, was withdrawn; and the king, affecting compassion and humanity, received the petitions of the widows<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1213.</NOTE> and the poor, and promised graciously to redress all their grievances.

To anticipate the bad effects of another miscarriage in this negotiation, he resolved to fortify himself with foreign alliances; he engaged his nephew Otho, the em∣peror, in his interest, by large subsidies, in consideration of which, that prince promised to assist him with all his power.

<PB N="435" REF="4440"/>
London and Ely, repaired to Rome, and earnestly intreated the pope to proceed to the deposition of John, whom they represented as a monster and tyrant, the object of universal hate and abhorrence. Innocent, in compliance with their re∣quest, assembled a council of cardinals and prelates, in which he solemnly deposed John, and declared the throne of England vacant: then he wrote to Philip, king of France, enjoining him to execute the sentence, and unite England to his dominions for ever. He, at the same time, published a crusade against the depos∣ed monarch all over Europe, exhorting the nobility, knights, and all men whatsoever, to take up arms against that persecutor of the church, and enlist under the banners of Philip, bestowing upon them the same indulgences that were granted to those who engaged against the infidels in the Holy Land: and lastly, he appointed Pandulf, his legate a latere, to see the sentence put in execution. Not but that he supplied him at the same time, with instructions and powers to make peace with John upon certain conditions, which if he should de∣lay accepting, till a certain day fixed for his final resolve, the legate was ordered to return immediately. Langton, and his two suffragans, having obtained their desire in the sentence of deposition, returned to France, in order to instigate Lewis to execute the pope's mandate; and they found that monarch as forward and sanguine as they could have wished. He had already formed the design of conquering England, and proposed the enterprize, in a general council of the prelates and nobility at Soissons, where he found them very well disposed to em∣bark in the undertaking. He had effected a match between his cousin Peter de Dreux, and Alice heiress of Brittany, by which alliance, the whole naval force of that province was at his disposal; he employed a whole year in building ships, and equipping a sufficient armament for an expedition of such importance. Eu∣stace a pyrate, who had been in the service of John, deserted to Philip with five stout vessels; he laid an embargo on all ships that were in the ports of France; he assembled a fleet of seventeen hundred sail at Boulogne, and fixed the ren∣dezvous of his army at Rouen, where all his barons and vassals were or∣dered to meet on the twenty-first day of April, on pain of being deemed traitors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Mean while, the king of England wreaked his revenge on Langton and the bishop of London, by cutting down the woods belonging to the see of Canterbury, and demolishing the castle of Stor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord; and having thus exhausted the first transports of his choler, began to prepare for opposing the invasion. He ordered all the ships of burthen in England to be brought, by their respective masters, to Portsmouth, ready manned, armed, and victualled, there to enter into his pay and service, on the twenty-fourth day of March. He appointed Dover, Feversham, and Ipswich, as places of rendezvous, to which he sum∣moned all his earls, barons, knights, esquires, and vassals, with horse and armour, before the twenty-first day of April, on pain of being branded for cowards and degraded. Such numbers assembled on this occasion, that by far the greatest part was sent home as unnecessary, though these were mostly of the common people. The bishop of Norwich arrived from his government, with five hundred knights, and the same number of light cavalry; and the whole force assembled on Barham-Down near Canterbury, amounted to sixty thousand men, well armed and appointed: yet, powerful as this body was, he placed his

<DIV4 N="42" TYPE="section">

<P>During this pause of expectation, two knights templar arrived with a message to the king from Pandulf, assuring his majesty of his hearty desire to employ his good offices in his behalf, and proposing a conference to settle the terms of his reconciliation with the church. John immediately embraced the proposal, and met the legate at Dove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where, in a conference, Pandulf ex∣patiated upon the prodigious armament of Ph lip, the influence of the exiled prelates and nobility, who would accompany that monarch in his expedition, and the dissatisfaction of the English, who had invited him to engage in such an undertaking. John, conscious of his own gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and unpopular character, was frightened at the picture he drew: he forthwith suspected every nobleman in his court and army; and his apprehensions were augmented<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by an idle prophecy of a hermit called Peter of Pontefract, who pretended to foretell that John would be deposed before the end of the year; a prediction which, whether it was the effect of knavery or superstition, made a very deep impression on the minds of the people, and operated strongly to the prejudice of the king's affairs. In a word, John was so terrified by these concurring considerations, that he agreed to the legate's proposals of peace; and swore to the observance of them, in presence of the count of Boulogne, the earls of Salisbury, Warrenne, and Ferers, who like∣wise promised, upon oath, to concur in the execution of the articles, to the fol∣lowing effect: King John shall admit into his favour archbishop Langton, and be reconciled to the exiled prelates, who shall resume their functions, and exer∣cise their authority without interruption; Robert Fitzwalter, Eustace de Vesc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and all others both of the clergy and laity, concerned in the association, shall be pardoned, and restored to their honours and estates; full restitution shall be made of all liberty and property, which hath been taken away in the course of this dispute; eight thousand pounds shall be immediately remitted in part of re∣stitution to the exiled prelates, for the payment of their debts and the expence of their return; and their agents shall be put into immediate possession of their effects and temporalities: John shall release all homage exacted from their vas∣sals since the interdict; reverse all sentences pronounced against clergymen or laymen on account of this dispute; and oblige himself to refrain from issuing writs of outlawry against churchmen for the future; all disputes about damages<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> shall be determined by the legate, or be referred to the pope's decision.</P>

<P>Though this reconciliation with the pope removed all ecclesiastical censures from the king and kingdom, and freed John from all the odium and danger which attended the resentment of the clergy, it could not prevent the in∣vasion of Philip, nor appease the discontents of the nobility, who had engaged to assist that monarch in his endeavours to ascend the English throne. These alarming circumstances still remained; and it required a very extraordinary ex∣pedient to prevent the mischief that m ght ensue. No scheme occurred so feasi∣ble as that of putting his kingdom under the protection of the Roman see, by which it would be screened from all the attempts of christian invaders; at least it would translate the odium from John to his enemies; and perhaps the artillery of the church might become as terrible to the monarch of France, as it had been to the king of England. John, finding himself reduced to the alternative of reigning as a vassal to the pope, or of being deposed altogether, and treated
<PB N="437" REF="4460"/>
as a murderer, usurper, and tyrant, had no room for hesitation. He resolved to do homage to Innocent; and the ceremony was performed in the house of the Templars at Dover. He resigned his crown to the pope's legate, and re∣ceived it again as a present from the see of Rome, to which he swore fealty as a vassal and feudatory. He obliged himself and his heirs to pay an acknowledg∣ment of the pope's superiority, and in lieu of service, an annual tribute of seven hundred marks for the kingdom of England, and three hundred for Ireland: but, even in this act of submission, he reserved to himself and his heirs the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris: Cart. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Joh. Act. Pub.</NOTE> power of administring justice, and all his rights and regalities. This shame∣ful ceremony was performed on Ascension day, in the midst of a great concourse of people, who beheld it with shame and indignation. John, in doing homage to the pope, presented a sum of money to his representative, which the proud legate trampled under his feet, as a mark of the king's dependence. Every spectator glowed with resentment, and the archbishop of Dublin exclaimed aloud against such intolerable insolence. Pandulf, not satisfied with this mor∣tifying act of superiority, kept the crown and scepter five whole days, and then restored them as the special favour of the holy see. John was despised before this extraordinary resignation; but now he was looked upon as a contemptible wretch, unworthy to sit upon the throne: while he himself seemed altogether insensible of his disgrace; nor did his pride and cruelty abate in consequence of this humiliation: he seemed to triumph in his having preserved his crown in spite of the prediction of the hermit, who had been imprisoned with a view to punish him, in case he should be found to have deceived the people with a false pro∣phecy; and now, though it was plainly verified, he ordered him to be hanged as an impostor.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>Pandulf having obtained this resignation, which was confirmed by the oaths of twelve principal barons, and three prelates, together with a char∣ter exempting clergymen from outlawry, and the sum of eight thousand pounds for the exiled bishops; he retired to the continent without removing the interdiction, or absolving John of his excommunication. Philip, who had un∣dertaken this expedition at the instances of the pope, and expended an immense sum in the naval armament he had prepared for the conquest of England, was extremely chagrined when the legate informed him of the transaction be∣tween him and John, at Dover, and cautioned him against invading the patri∣mony of St. Peter. He knew the consequence of an interdict, and sentence of excommunication. This very resignation was a recent example of the papal authority; but, at the same time, he was sensible of having a great advantage over John, in the affection and esteem of his subjects; and resolved to prose∣cute the war in spite of the pope and all his censures. He would not, however, make a descent upon England, until he should reduce Ferrand, count of Flan∣ders, John's ally, who might invade his dominions in his absence; and there∣fore he began his march along the coast from Calais, while his fleet supplied him with provisions, as he advanced. Having reduced Cassel, Ypres, and some other places, he undertook the siege of Bruges, and his navy lay at anchor at Damme, about two leagues from the place. Ferrand, in this emergency, sollicited succours from England; and John sent immediately to his relief, a fleet of five hundred large ships, well provided, besides eight hundred smaller vessels, with seven hundred knights, and a great body of forces, under the com∣mand
<PB N="438" REF="4470"/>
of W. Longue-Epée, earl of Salisbury, and Renaud, count of Boulogne. When they approached the French fleet at Damme, it appeared so numerous, that they were startled, and began to think it would be impracticable to attack it with any probability of success; but, receiving i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lligence, that almost all the French forces were on shore, employed in the siege of Ghent, which Philip had undertaken after the reduction of Bruges, they attacked the shipping with great fury, took above three hundred vessels laden with provisions, arms, and ammu∣nition; burned an hundred that ran a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, while the rest, being farther out at sea, saved themselves by flight. The English, flushed w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th this success, landed in order to reduce Damme, and destroy the vessels that were in the harbour; but they met with such a warm reception from a body of French forces, which Philip had detached to the place at their first appearance on the coast, that they were obliged to re-imbark with precipitation, and considerable loss. This advantage was too trivial to console the French king for the damage he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us∣tained. His design upon England was absolutely deseated: he ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is re∣maining ships, that were in the harbour of Damme, to be unloaded and set on fire, that they might not fall into the hands of the English: he exacted hos∣tages from Ghent, Ypres, and Bruges, for the payment of the ransom to which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Philip's expedition to E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gland being defeated for one year, John dismissed the troops he had assembled for the protection of the coast, and pro∣jected, in his turn, an invasion o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> France on the side of Flanders, by Ferrand, reinforced with part of the English troops already in that country; and the emperor Otho promis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to furnish a considerable army for that purpose; while John h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself proposed to land in Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tou, and attack France on that quar∣ter.

<P>Joh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> submitted to every thing that Langton was pleased to pro∣pose; and having smarted so severely by his quarr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls with the clergy, resolved
<PB N="439" REF="4480"/>
for the future to avoid intermeddling in their affairs. Whenever a see became vacant, he granted the Congé d'Elire to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l it up, and left the election entirely to the chapters a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> convents, without presuming to recommend any particular person. Perhaps this tameness encouraged the insolence of Langton, who, though he had never received the least provocation from John, seems to have come over with a view, not only to augment the papal authority, but also to embroil the nation, and distress the king's affairs. He possessed all the pride, arrogance, and turbulent disposition, of Becket, whose example he affected to imitate: he grasped at the disposal of all ecclesiastical dignities, and wanted to act as sovereign, even in civil affairs. The ceremony of John's absolution being performed, and every other necessary step taken for the satisfaction of the cler∣gy, that prince returned to Portsmouth in order to prosecute his expedition; but his vassals having already attended the greatest part of the forty days they were obliged to serve, gave him to understand, that their money was almost ex∣hausted, and they could not proceed without a supply from his exchequer. This proposal he rejected, and on the supposition that they would follow him of their own accord, embarked with his own houshold, and set sail for the island of Jersey. He had appointed Geoffrey Fitzpiers, and Peter, bishop of Win∣chester, regents of the realm in his absence, and enjoined them to consult the arch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishop of Canterbury in all affairs of consequence. These justiciaries sum∣moned a council at St. Albans, where the king's peace was proclaimed, reviv∣ing the laws of Henry I. abrogating those that were oppressive, abolishing ale∣schots, or drinking booths, kept by foresters to extort money, on pretence of informing again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the people for transgre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions; and forbidding, on severe pe∣nalties, all sheriffs, foresters, and other officers of the crown, to extort money, on any prete<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e whatsoever.</P>

<P>Immediately after this council, John returned from Jersey trans∣ported with indignation against the barons, who had refused to serve in the ex∣pedition; and as these were gene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally from the north, he forthwith assembled an army in order to chastise them for their disobe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience. With this view he had advanced as far as Northampton, where he was overtaken by Langton, who forbade him to proceed, observing, that he could not make war without the consent of his clergy, unless he had a mind to infringe the oath he had taken at his a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solution. John replied, that this was a secular affair, in which the clergy had no concern, and next day continued his march to Nottingham; but thither <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was pursued by the archbishop, who threatened to excommunicate him and all his followers, unless they would immediately desist from this enterprize; and John was fain to comply.

<P>This prelate was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt over, at John's request, by the bishop of Norwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, whom he had sent ambassador to Otho, and directed to proce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from the imperial court to Rome, with complaints against Langton, who had entered into a conspiracy with the nobility against the king. At a sy∣nod of his prelates and clergy convened in St. Paul's, on pretence of examining the losses of the exiled bishops, Langton had conferred privately with a number
<PB N="440" REF="4490"/>

<P>Nicholas, immediately after his arrival, received the king's homage in the church of St. Paul, together with the first year's tribute of a thousand marks, according to a new instrument of John's r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>signation and fealty, sealed with a golden bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. The prelates and nobility were assembled, as well for this ceremony, as with a view to fix the estimate of the damages, which was at∣tended with some difficulty from the contradictory accounts that were produced by the king's officers, and the commissioners of the exiled prelates.

<P>While the legate was employed in this visitation, John, being prossed by his foreign allies to fulfil his engagements, resolved to prosecute his expedi∣tion to Poitou, according to the promise he had made to Raymund, count of Tholouse, and Guy, count of Auvergne. Raymond, together with the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, had visited him in the winter to receive their pensions, and concert the operations of the ensuing campa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn.

Having therefore made the necessary preparations, and left Peter, bishop of Wincheste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as justicia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the realm, which was likewise put under the legate's protection, he set sail from Portsmouth in the beginning of February, and about the middle of the month landed at Rochelle. He was joined by Savary Mauleon when he entered Poiton, where he took di∣vers castles, and reduced several powerful barons, among whom was Geoffrey
<PB N="441" REF="4500"/>
de Lusignan, who did homage to John at Parthenay, together with Hugh, count de la Marche, and his brother the count D'Eu, in consequence of a treaty by which John promised to restore the lands in England, formerly be∣longing to this last nobleman, and to bestow his daughter Jane in marriage upon Hugh's eldest son, with a rental of two thousand pounds sterling. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Poitou being thus secured in the interest of John, he marched into Anjou, where he reduced Beaufort with some other inconsiderable places; leaving directions for fortifying Angers, he advanced to besiege the fortress of La Roche in Maine, from whence he detached pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties to ravage the Pai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nantois, and in a skirmish took Robert, eldest son of the count de Dreux, and fourteen French noblemen. In order to stop the progress of his conquests, and relieve the for∣tress which he had invested, Lewis, prince of France, and the mareschal Henry Clement, took the field with a body of horse and foot; and though John was greatly superior to them in number, he no sooner heard of their approach, than he raised the siege, and retired with such precipitation, that he left his tents, baggage, and military engines, to the enemy, lost a good number of his men in crossing the river Loire, and marched eighteen leagues in one day, without<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.

Thus did John lose by his cowardice all the footing he had gained in Anjou; while his allies in Flanders sustained a total defeat from Philip, at Bo∣vines; where the emperor Otho, being vanquished in a pitched battle, narrowly escaped captivity; and the counts of Flanders, Holland, and Boulogne, with the earl of Salisbury, were taken prisoners. This victory, obtained over an ar∣my of one hundred and forty thousand men, effectually prevented a revolt, which had been concerted by some of the French nobility with the barons of Anjou, Maine, and Normandy. They now despaired of success; and Philip, marching immediately into Poitou, received at Loudun the submission of the viscount de Thouars, to whom he was reconciled, by the mediation of Peter de Dreux, duke of Brittany. John, seeing all his schemes blasted, and terrified at Philip's progress, sollicited the good offices of Robert de Curson, an English∣man, who resided at the court of France as the pope's legate, assuring him that he intended to undertake an expedition for the relief of the Christians in the Ho∣ly Land. Robert employed his interest and remonstrances so effectually, that the French king agreed to a truce for five years, during which every thing should remain, on each side, in its present situation; and, Robert de Dreux be∣ing exchanged for the earl of Salisbury, John returned to England, after a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>During his absence, a dispute had arisen between the legate Nicholas and the archbishop of Canterbury, from which he reaped some advantage. Lang∣ton taking umbrage at the other's filling up all the ecclesiastical vacancies, with∣out his concurrence, assembled his suffragans at Dunstaple, and, with their con∣sent, inhibited Nicholas from supplying the vacancies within the province of Canterbury, appealing to the pope from any step he should take contrary to this exhibition. The legate paying no regard to this declaration, continued to fill up the vacant benefices; and, in the mean time, dispatched Pandulf to op∣pose the appeal at the court of Rome. Innocent was already prepossessed against Langton and his suffragans, who, he understood, made a practice of embezz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the greatest part of the Peter-pence, collected within their respective dioceses;
<PB N="442" REF="4510"/>
he had even directed Nicholas to call them to account for this alienation, and compel them to refund, by dint of ecclesiastical censures, if they should be found necessary; and now Pandulf giving a favourable account of John's conduct, and a disadvantageous idea of Langton's turbulence and pride, the pope be∣lieved every suggestion to their prejudice. Indeed he was influenced by more substantial proofs than bare assertion. He saw the golden bull of resignation and homage; touched the first annual payment, and was assured that Nicholas freely exercised his legarine powers, without any interruption from the crown. He therefore lent a deaf ear to all the representations of the archbishop's bro∣ther, Simon Langton, and the other agents sent to justify the appeal; and favoured John with a grant, exempting his person from excommunication, and his royal chapel from an interdict, without a special mandate from his holi∣ness;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> so that he could no longer be distressed by the censures of the metropo∣litan. At the same time, he directed Nicholas to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver the nation from the interdict, upon John's giving security for paying twelve thousand pounds a year to Langton and the other bishops who had been exiled, until the whole should amount to forty thousand marks, at which he rated their damages. The legate, in consequence of this order, convoked a council at St. Paul's, and John finding sureties for what remained unpaid, the interdict, which had continued six years, was removed, to the unspeakable joy of the nation in general; though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>This dispute was no sooner terminated, than the nation was involved in other troubles of far greater consequence. The barons of Langton's conspiracy as∣sembled, on pretence of devotion, at St. Edmundsbury, where they bound themselves by oath at the great altar, to demand of the king the confi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mation of their liber∣ties contained in the charter of Henry I. and the laws to which it referred; and to compel him to do them justice by force of arms, should he refuse to com∣ply with their request. Pursuant to this obligation, they repaired in the begin∣ning of January to London, in a military garb and equipage, and presented their demand to the king, observing, that he had promised to grant it, when he<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1215</NOTE> was absolved at Winchester. Far from complying with their request, the king resented their presumption, and insisted upon their promising under their hands and seals, that they never would demand or ext<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt such liberties, either from him or his successors: but, finding that all the roblemen a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out his person, except two or three, refused to obey this order, as an unprecedented act of power; and that the other barons were not only inflexible, but already prepared to sup∣port their petition with force of arms; he began to be apprehensive of his per∣son, and, in order to gain time, desired he might defer his answer, upon such<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paris.</NOTE> an important affair, till the latter end of Easter, when they should have satis∣faction. The reigns of weak princes have always been favourable to the na∣tural rights of mankind. Liberty has often sprung from despotism and usur∣pation. A king conscious of his own weak title to the throne, is glad to com∣pound with his subjects. A tyrant drives them to despair, in consequence of which they sometimes recover their freedom. The Saxon barons enjoyed original priviledges from a fair compact between the people and the king, on whom they conferred the sovereign authority. The Normans had no title
<PB N="443" REF="4520"/>
to the benefit of those laws, which were infringed by the very nature of their tenure; for they possessed their lands by the ejectment of the rightful propri∣etors; but Henry I. reconciled them to his usurpation by granting this charter, which he never intended to observe. The same bait had been offered to them by Stephen, for the same reason; and though he had likewise neglected the per∣formance of his promise, they looked upon these grants and promises as legal rights to be asserted with the first convenient opportunity. They could never have found a more favourable conjuncture, than the reign of a weak, capricious prince, like John, universally hated and despised by his subjects.</P>

<P>He was very sensible of the dangerous predicament in which he stood, and began to take precautions against the impending mischief. He exacted a new oath of allegiance from all persons throughout England: he courted the fa∣vour of the clergy by granting a charter, establishing the right of free elections in all churches, monasteries, cathedrals, and conventical societies; assumed the cross that he might enjoy the benefit and priviledge annexed to those, who dedi∣cated themselves to the service of God against the infidels; and sent William Mauclere to Rome, to complain of the conspiracy, and crave the pope's parti∣cular protection. The barons, at the same time, dispatched Eustace de Vescy, and other agents, to justify their conduct, and soll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cit the mediation of his ho∣liness, towards the recovery of their undoubted rights and priviledges; they as∣sured the pope, that not only the northern barons, who first avowed the de∣mand, were concerned in the confederacy, but it was the general cause of the whole nation; and in order to engage him in their behalf, they exaggerated their own merit in supporting the liberty of the church, while the kingdom laboured under the interdict. Innocent, who considered John as his own pupil, whom he could at all times govern, wrote letters to the prelates and barons of England, reproaching Langton and the bishops for favouring these dissensions, and com∣manding them to promote peace between the parties: he exhorted the barons to sue the king in humble manner, in which case he would interpose his good offices in favour of all their just petitions; but in the mean time he annulled their association, and forbade them to engage in any such confederacy for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Neither bishops nor barons paid the least regard to the pope's remon∣strance, or to John's privilege of pilgrimage. They reviled him as a scanda∣lous vassal of the pope, to whom he had given up the independency of the kingdom. They employed all their arts and emissaries to kindle a spirit of re∣volt in the nation; and as every baron saw his own advantage connected with the success of their scheme, there was hardly a nobleman of any consequence in the kingdom, who did not either personally engage in the design, or at least wish well to the undertaking. The confederates appointed their rendezvous in Easter-week at Stamford, where they assembled to a prodigious number of horse and foot; and marched to Bruckley, about five leagues distant from Ox∣ford, where John at that time resided. Hearing of their approach, he sent the archbishop of Canterbury, the earl of Pembroke, and others of his coun∣cil, to know the particulars of their demands, and they delivered a schedule, containing their ancient rights and priviledges, extracted from Henry's charter, and the laws of Edward the Confessor. These were deemed so exorbitant by

John, that he expressed his wonder, they had not asked the kingdom and all; and flatly ref<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed to comply with their desire. Then they chose Robert Fitz∣walter for their general, cignifying him with the title of mareschal, or constable, of the army of God and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly church; and advanced to Northampton, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle of which they could not take for want of military engines.

<P>When they rejected John's offers to abolish any evil customs which might have been introduced in his reign, or in that of his brother Richard, and to redress their grievances by the advice of his council, he appealed to Lang∣ton and his suffragans, desiring them to fulminate the thunder of the church upon those who had taken arms against a prince engaged in the crusade, whose person and dominions were accounted sacred. Pandulph thought his request was reasonable: but the archbishop declared, he would not pass any censure upon the barons, while John expressed a suspicion of the fidel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of his own subjects, in sending for a body of mercenary auxi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iaries from the continent; tho' if he would d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miss those foreigners, he would not only excommunicate his enemies, but even join him personally in opposing them.

They plundered the countries through which they passed; maltreated the sheriffs and other officers employed to collect the revenue; burned the king's houses, demolished his park walls, cut down his woods, and seemed intent upon provoking him to a renewal of hostilities. These violences, which were chiefly committed in the north, alarmed the bishops to such a degree, that they proposed a meeting with the king at Oxford, in order to take effectual measures for the preservation of the peace. There the barons ap∣peared with a vast train of followers; but John sent deputies to complain of the injuries he had received, and excuse his not coming in person to an assembly, in which he did not think his life would be secure. They afterwards met at Staines, where his commissioners protested, in his name, against the infractions of the treaty, and conjured the bishops to publish the sentence of excommuni∣cation against all who disturbed the peace of the king and kingdom; which sen∣tence John had obtained of the pope, to whom he had appealed in private im∣mediately after the confirmation of the charters. He had sent copies of them to his holiness, representing them as violent usurpations upon the right of the pope, as lord paramount of the kingdom; and begged he might be absolved from his oath, so as to seize the first opportunity of freeing himself from such a disagree∣able and shameful restraint His remonstrance had the desired effect upon Innocent. That pontiff received these tidings with equal surprize and indignation; he inveighed against the presumption of the barons, who had dared to extort such charters from a vassal of the Roman see, and take arms against their own sove∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign, even while he was intitled to a particular veneration as the soldier of Christ. He s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore that their insolence should not pass unpunished; he annulled the two charters, released the king from his oath, wrote letters to the barons, com∣manding them to recede from the privileges they had extorted; and his orders being neglected, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against them, and di∣rected cardinal Langton to publish the bull. This publication was what the king's agents now demanded: but Langton, pretending the pope had been misinformed, refused to o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the mandate, until he should have insormed his holiness of the whole transaction. Upon his refusal, Pandulf and the bishop of Rochester, the pope's commissaries, publ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed the bull, and suspended the archbishop, accord∣ing to the orders they had received.

Notwithstanding this disaster, John assembled such an army of Germans, Brabantins, and Flemings at Dover, that he found himself in a conditien to take the field against the barons. With those auxi iaries, he invested the castle of Rochester, which Robert Fitzwalter attempted ineffectual y to relieve; the bridges were brok<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n down, and all the ports occupied in such a manner by the enemy, that he was obliged to return to London. William d'Albiney the governor, made an obstinate defence for two months, during which, provisions failing, the garrison ate all the horses in the castle; till at length, even this re∣source was exhausted, and the defences being ruined by the military engines of the besiegers, he surrendered at discretion. John was so incensed at the loss he had sustained before the place, that he would have put all the garrison to death without exception, had not he been diverted from this barbarous purpose by Sa∣vary de Mauleon, who represented that the barons would undoubtedly make a retaliation, so that a barbarous practice would be introduced to the disgrace of humanity, and the prejud ce of his maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty's affairs.

<P>This was a terrible blow to the confederacy; and the pope's second bull of excommunication arriving at the same time, struck such a damp upon the party, that it was deserted by some of its most considerable supports, and in particular by Gilbert Fitz-Rainfroy, and the constab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Chester, who re∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> to the king's service. John, after the reduction of Rochester, found his affairs in such a flourishing condition, that he formed two strong armies, with one of which he marched to the northward, leaving the other under the com∣mand of the earl of Salisbury and Falcasius de Breant, who reduced the castles of Bed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, Hunslape, and Tunbridge, and having supplied those of Windsor, Berkhamstede, and Hertford, with strong garrisons, to hamper the Londoners,
<PB N="449" REF="4580"/>
marched into Essex, where they reduced the castles and plundered the lands be∣longing to the revolted barons. John proceeded in the same manner in his march, till he arrived at Nottingham, from whence he summoned the strong castle of Belvoir to surrender, threatening, in case of a refusal, to put the owner, William d'Albiney, to death; and the governor delivered it up without capi∣tulation. The foreign mercenaries committed horrible cruelties in their march, and ravaged the country in a dreadful manner. These outrages provoked and exasperated the nobility of Yorkshire, who leaving their estates at the mercy of those bloodhounds, retired to Scotland, where they did homage and swore fealty, in the chapter-house of Melross, to Alexander, king of that country. That prince, though no more than eighteen years of age, had already made an irruption into England, and received the oath from the malecontent barons of Northum∣berland. John pursued them in their retreat, and, as if he had been marching in the territories of some barbarous despotic enemy, laid waste the whole country as he advanced. The castles of the fugitives were secured by garrisons; the seats, farms, villages, and towns, were pillaged and utterly destroyed; the noblemen of Northumberland followed those of Yorkshire into Scotland; the towns of Milford, Morpeth, Alnwick, and Werk, were reduced to ashes; and Rox∣burg, Berwick, Haddington, and Dunbar, underwent the same fate, by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

Hav∣ing thus desolated a vast tract of country, and reduced all the castles belonging to the northern barons, except one in Yorkshire belonging to Robert de Ros, he committed the government of the whole country, between the Teese and the Tweed, to Hugh de Baliol and Philip de Hulcote, with a good body of forces to over-awe the malecontents, and marched in person to the borders of Wales, where he reduced a good number of castles, some of which he demolished, and others he secured with strong garrisons.</P>

<P>The barons were now reduced to a deplorable situation. Instead of recovering their privileges, they saw their estates ravaged, and parcelled out among foreigners, and the king triumphing in the vengeance he had taken. In this emergency, they were in their turn inspired with the fury of revenge, and took a desperate resolution which had well nigh been productive of their own slavery and their country's ruin. They sent deputies to Philip, king of France, with an offer of the crown to his son Lewis, provided he would come over and assist them with a force sufficient to dethrone the tyrant by whom they were op∣pressed. This was a very agreeable invitation to the French king, who waited only for an opportunity to resume the design of annexing England to his dominions; he therefore embraced the proposal of the barons, of whom, however, he de∣manded five and twenty hostages for the performance of their promise, and these being sent over, he began to prepare in earnest for the expedition. John, at his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> return from the north, hovered about London, as if he meant to besiege that city, so that the barons demanded an immediate reinforcement. Philip sent over a detachment of seven thousand men, commanded by the Castellans of St. Omer, Arras, and Giles de Melun, who arrived safely at London, after hav∣ing destroyed a fleet of pyrates that blocked up the river. Then John, despairing of success in his attempt upon the capital, marched into Kent, with a view to
<PB N="450" REF="4590"/>
engage the Cinque ports in his interest, and oppose the landing of Lewis, for whose descent great preparations were making in the ports of France.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="64" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The pope, being informed of Philip's intention, dispatched one Gualo as his legate to the French court, with a mandate, forbidding the French king or his son to invade England, which was part of the patrimony of St. Peter. But this prohibition had no effect upon the French monarch, who pro∣ceeded with the equipment of his armament, which being compleated, his son Lewis embarked the troops, and setting sail with a fleet of seven hundred vessels, landed without opposition at Sandwich; John retreating from Dover to Win∣chester, after having left a strong garrison in the castle, under the command of Hubert de Burgh, a brave and trusty adherent. In this retreat, he met the pope's legate just arrived from France, who excommunicated Lewis by name, together with all his followers and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttors; and this censure was extended to the clergy of London, and particularly to Simon Langton, who had encouraged them to perform divine service in their churches, notwithstanding an excommunication and interdict issued against the city by the pope, and published by the abbot of Abingdon. Lewis had endeavoured to pacify the legate, and avert those cen∣sures, by trumping up a lame title to the throne, in right of his wife Blanche of Castile, who was grand-daughter to Henry II. supported by the consent and in∣vitation of the people, groaning under the tyranny of a usurper, and convicted homicide: but Gualo paying no regard to these representations, he resolved to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the pope at defiance, and marched immediately against the castle of Roches∣ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>Thence he advanced to London, where the barons and burghers did him homage, and took the oath of fealty, after he had sworn to leave every per∣son in possession of his inheritance, and re-establish the privileges of the nation. Though he was never crowned king of England, he exercised the sovereign au∣thority, under the title of Domini Regis Franciae Primogenitus, granting char∣ters for lands and honours, and created Simon Langton his high chancellor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r.</NOTE> This prince saw the number of his partisans daily increase, while those of John diminished in the same proportion; for all the Flemings and vassals of the crown of France, in the king's pay, abandoned his service, rather than fight against the son and heir of their natural sovereign; so that John was disabled from keeping the field, and having garri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned his castles, retired towards Bristol and Gloucester.

<P>Lewis met with no resistance, but from William de Collingham, who, with a body of archers, retired to the woods and fastnesses, from whence
<PB N="451" REF="4600"/>
he sallied upon the French, whom he defeated in different encounters; nor could all the power of Lewis subdue this bold adventurer. John's affairs seem∣ing desperate, he was deserted by the earls of Warenne, Salisbury, Arundel, Albemarle, and Oxford; and Lewis, elevated by his prosperity, convoked a ge∣neral council at London, to exact the oath of allegiance from all the prelates and nobility of England. Among others, Alexander, king of Scotland, was sum∣moned to this assembly, and, according to the order he received, raised a strong body of forces, with which he reduced the city of Carlisle; from thence he marched to London, and did homage to Lewis, after that prince and the Eng∣lish barons had sworn that they would not make peace without his concur∣rence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>About this period, however, John's affairs began to put on a more favourable aspect. The northern barons in besieging Barnard castle, had the misfortune to lose Eustace de Vesci, who was the soul of their confederacy; and though William Mareschal the younger, had prevailed upon the city of Wor∣cester to declare for Lewis, it was afterwards recovered to John by that nobleman's own father the earl of Pembroke, who, in conjunction with the earl of Chester, and Fulk de Breant, retrieved also and fortified the Isle of Ely. The Cinque∣ports, having equipped a fleet for the king's service, intercepted a great reinforce∣ment destined for the French prince, and cut off the communication with Lon∣don by sea, while Hubert de Burgh, governor of Dover castle, made continual excursions and ravaged the lands of the barons. Lewis, after the reduction of Winchester, invested this fortress, which was so gallantly defended by the vigi∣lant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astellan, that he made very little progress in the siege; he was repulsed in several attacks with great slaughter, and so continually harrassed by the sallies of the besieged, that he swore, in a transport of rage, he would not quit the place, until he should have taken the castle and seen the garrison hanged. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<DIV4 N="68" TYPE="section">

<P>While he spent his time in this fruitless enterprize, and another army commanded by the barons was employed in reducing the country of the East-Angles, John carried on the war in the marches of South Wales, against Reginald de Braouse and Llewellyn, who had declared for his enemies. Having taken their castles, and assembled an army in the west, upon whose fidelity he could depend, he marched into Norfolk, ravaged the lands belonging to his ad∣versaries, and compelled Gilbert de Gand, whom Lewis had created earl of that county, to raise the siege of Lincoln. By this time, Lewis had lost the af∣fection of the principal noblemen who had hitherto supported his cause: he not only excluded them from his councils, but bestowed all his favours upon fo∣reigners, and these treated the English with the most supercilious contempt. This partiality and insolence was so much resented by the barons, that they began to repent of having invited a foreign prince into the kingdom. He was deserted by the earl of Salisbury, William Mareschal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Walter Beauchamp, and several other noblemen; and their defection alarmed him with suspicions con∣cerning the fidelity of those that remained. Thus actuated by jealousy and re∣sentment, he is said to have formed a plan of vengeance, which was discovered to them by the viscount de Melun, one of his chief confidents. That nobleman, de∣spairing of his recovery from a very dangerous distemper, by which he was seized at London, expressed a desire of seeing some of the barons that were left
<PB N="452" REF="4610"/>
in the capital, and told them, that he could not die in peace until he should dis∣charge his conscience, by discovering an affair in which they were deeply in∣terefted: then he gave them to understand, that Lewis had resolved to punish all the English barons, who had fought in his cause, as traitors to their natural prince, on whose fidelity he could have no dependance. The barons, startled at this information, which seemed to tally with their own remarks, communicated the dying words of this Frenchman to their friends and confederates, that they might be upon their guard, and take the first convenient opportunity to detach themselves from such a perfidious and ungrateful chief; they began to think se∣ricusly of reconciling themselves to their own sovereign, and upwards of forty had already given John assurances of returning to their obedience, when death prevented him from reaping the fruits of their good intention.</P>

<P>That unfortunate monarch, after having ravaged the lands of the revolted barons in Norfolk, retired to Lynne, which was the rendezvous of all his forces, and, assembling a numerous army, resolved to penetrate into the heart of the kingdom, and hazard a decisive battle, hoping to be joined in his march by those who were discontented with Lewis. Thus determined, he departed from Lynne, which, for its fidelity, he had distinguished with many marks of his favour: his route lying over the washes between Lincolnshire and Norfolk, which are overflowed at high water, he judged his time so impru∣dently, that the tide rushed in upon him, and he lost the greatest part of his forces, together with all his treasure, baggage, and regalia. He himself hardly escaped with life, and arrived at the abbey of Swinestead, where he was so deeply affected with his irreparable loss, that his grief produced a violent fever. Next day, being unable to ride on horseback, he was carried in a litter to the castle of Seaford, and from thence removed to Newark, where, after having made his will, he died, on the 19th day of October, in the fiftieth and first year of his age, and the eighteenth of his reign. His bowels were buried in the abbey of Croxton, and his body in the cathedral of Worcester, between the graves of St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rad N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger Brady <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Oswald and St. Wulstan.</P>

<P>John was in his person taller than the middle size, of a good shape, and agreeable countenance. With respect to his disposition, it is strongly deli∣neated in the transactions of his reign.

<P>JOHN had bequeathed the crown to his eldest son Henry; but that prince being but ten years of age, the kingdom was left without a rul∣er, in a state of anarchy and distraction; and the royal family had very little to hope from the very small number of noblemen who adhered to the late king, and a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcenary army of foreigners, in whose fidelity John himself had never ful<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y confided. The nation was averse to the memory of that unhappy prince; the barons were sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l under those arms, which they had assumed for his destruc∣tion; and the greatest part of the kingdom had submitted an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken the oath of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legiance to Lewis of France. It was well for the English that this impoli∣tic prince made such an unpopular use of his prosperity. Had he behaved with a shew of impartiality and moderation, the country would, in all probability, have been enslaved; but he had already forfeited the esteem of the people, by his haughty deportment, contempt of their persons and manners, and unjust partiality to his own countrymen, at whose insolence and extortion he connived. The commonalty inveighed in public against the insolence of those strangers; and the mutual confidence which at first subsisted between Lewis and the nobi∣lity, was now qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te destroyed. The majority of the barons had resolved to re∣nounce the French interest, even before the king's decease; and that event de∣prived them of all cause of opposition. As soon as that prince expired, the earl of Pembroke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was well acquainted with the sentiments of both parties, summoned the barons to Gloucester, and those that adhered to John being assem∣bled, he presented young Henry, saying, "Behold your king."

Jude, in presence of the pope's legate; and as the crown had been left in the Washes, they used a simple sillet of gold for the ceremony, which was per∣formed by the bishops of Bath and Winchester; because Langton was still at Rome, solliciting the removal of his suspension. The young king took the custo∣mary oath at his coronation, and the legate insisted upon his doing homage to the holy see; a demand which the few nobles there assembled did not think pro∣per to refuse: then the barons swore fealty to his majesty, and his person was committed to the charge of the earl of Pembroke, who acted as regent of the kingdom.</P>

<P>This office could not have been conferred upon a nobleman of greater<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1216.</NOTE> honour and capacity. He had preserved his attachment to John, with the most inviolable fidelity, even in the midst of all his misfortunes. He was perfectly well acquainted with the cause of the late troubles, as well as with the interests and intrigues of those by whom they had been excited. He knew how ill af∣fected the barons were to the prince whom they had invited to the kingdom; was privy to the secret negotiation between the late king and the forty barons, who had promised to renounce the party of Lewis; and he did not doubt but that the confederacy would dissolve, as soon as they should think themselves secure from the penalties of rebellion. In this hope he, by circular letters, noti∣fied young Henry's coronation to all the barons and communities of the king∣dom; and promised a general amnesty to all those who should return to their obedience. This assurance, and the known probity of the regent, made strong impressions upon many barons of the association: and this was reinforced by the sentence of excommunication against Lewis, which the legate repeated every Sunday, and in which they themselves were included; for however they might have set those censures of excommunication at defiance, when their pas∣sions were inflamed with the first glowings of hope and resentment, and their op∣position was encouraged by the vigorous union and spirited measures of a strong confederacy, these impul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and concurring motives were now considerably weakened, and the tender consciences of some among them began to feel the pangs of remorse and the horrors of ecclesiastical censure.</P>

<P>Lewis had long ago lost the affection of the barons, and now he became the object of their contempt. He had frequently attempted to corrupt the integrity of Hubert de Burgh, governor of Dover castle, but still found his honour and courage equally invincible. He was employed in the siege of this fortress, at the death of John, which he thought would produce a change in Hubert's con∣duct: he summoned him once more to surrender, and represented, in a parley, that as he was now disengaged from the oath of allegiance he had taken, he ought to make no scruple in acknowledging a prince whom his countrymen had received as their sovereign, and who would take pleasure in giving him particular marks of his favour. The honest governor answered, that the late king had left a son and successor, whom it was his duty to obey; that he would serve the young prince to the last drop of his blood; and, with regard to the promises of Lewis, he said the esteem of a magnanimous prince could never be purchased by such infamous treachery. Lewis, finding him incorruptible, changed his battery, and threatened to take away the life of his brother, who was in his power. Hubert preferred his duty to his brother, and continued impregnable; so that the besieger was obliged to abandon his enterprize. He <NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>
<PB N="458" REF="4670"/>
repaired to London, extremely chagrined at his miscarriage, and having taken measures for securing his interest in that capital, marched against the castle of Hert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd, which surrendered, after a faint resistance. The custody of this for∣tress belonged by hereditary right to Robert Fitz-walter, who demanded it ac∣cordingly, and not only suffered a repulse, but had the mortification to see the government conferred on a Frenchman, and the castle garrisoned with fo∣reigners. This insulting act of injustice produced a great clamour among the English<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were stripped of their inheritances by aliens, and even re∣viled as traitors, who could not be entrusted with any place of importance: they now believed in good earnest the truth of what the count de Melun had dis∣covered on his death-bed, and looked upon themselves as victims devoted to destruction. Thus a general discontent prevailed among the English, who resolved to make him feel the effects of their resentment; mean while he pro∣ceded in his conquests, and about the end of the year returned to London.</P>

<P>The regent on his side neglected nothing which could contribute to∣wards the maintenance of his pupil's pretensions. He notified his coronation to the pope, and sollicited the protection of his holiness, in favour of the young prince, surrounded by foreign and domestic enemies; and Innocent, who was never wanting to his own interest, exerted himself for the preservation of Eng∣land, as the patrimony of St. Peter. He sent new powers to the legate, to aggravate the excommunication of Lewis and his adherents; and that prince, being made acquainted with the mandate, protested solemnly against every<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> step which should be taken to his prejudice. In the mean time he appointed a day for receiving anew the homage of the English barons: but, notwith∣standing this precaution, the legate assembled a synod at Bristol, where he re∣peated the sentence of excommunication against Lewis; and several barons made this censure a pretext for refusing the homage that was required. Lewis was now glad to accept the proposal of a short truce, during which he held a general assembly at Oxford. The regent convoked another at Cambridge, and demanded a prolongation of the truce, which the prince of France at first refused, till hearing the pope intended to excommunicate him in full consistory, he consented to a further suspension of hostilities, that he might make a short tour to Paris, and consult the king his father. The earl of Pem∣broke did not fail to seize this opportunity of strengthening his army with new levies, and making proselytes to the king's interest. Among others gained over on this occasion, was his own son William Mareschal, who had been a zealous partisan of the barons; and the Cinque-Ports not only declared for Henry, but equipped a fleet, with which they attacked Lewis in his return, and destroyed some of his vessels; an insult which provoked him to such a degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1217.</NOTE> that when he landed at Sandwich he reduced the town to ashes.</P>

<P>At the expiration of the truce, the regent sent the earl of Chester to besiege Montsorrel, in the county of Leicester, defended by a French garrison; and Lewis detached the count de Perche, at the head of twenty thousand men, to give him battle. The earl of Chester, being greatly inferior in point of number, abandoned the enterprize, and retired at his approach; and the French general advancing to Lincoln, invested the castle, which was held for the king, though the town declared for the barons. The regent resolved to succour this important place, though at the expence of an engagement; he assembled his
<PB N="459" REF="4680"/>
forces with equal diligence and secrecy, and had marched as far as Newark, within twelve miles of Lincoln, before the count de Perche had the least inti∣mation of his approach. That general immediately held a council of war, in which some of the most experienced officers advised him to quit the town, and give the earl of Pembroke battle in the open plain, where he could use his ca∣valry, which otherwise would be useless; but the majority were of opinion that having reduced the castle to extremity, they ought not to give up that advan∣tage, but continue the siege and remain in the town, which was in no danger of being forced by the regent. In consequence of this determination, they forti∣fied the walls so as to render the place defensible; and the regent, approaching without opposition, threw into the castle, by a postern, a choice body of troops, commanded by Fulk de Breant, who, according to the instructions he had re∣ceived, made a furious sally upon the besiegers, while the earl of Pembroke assaulted one of the city gates. This double attack soon produced confusion among the French forces, which were hampered for want of room, and saw themselves charged on all sides with the most enthusiastic fury. The count de Perche having made surprising efforts to rally his troops and sustain the impetuo∣sity of the English, saw himself at last entirely defeated; and disdaining to survive the disgrace, rushed upon the swords of the enemy. The earls of Winchester and Hereford, Gilbert de Ghent, and Robert Fitz-walter, with four hundred knights and a great number of esquires and common soldiers, were taken prisoners; but no quarter was given to the French, who were all cut in pieces. The town, which from the beginning of the troubles had espoused the cause of the barons, was abandoned to pillage, and the soldiers gained inestimable booty; so that they dis∣tinguished<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. Trivit.</NOTE> the pillage by the appellation of Lincoln fair. As for all the priests and persons belonging to the church, that were found in the place, they were treated as excommunicated wretches, by the express desire of the legate, who had con∣fessed and given absolution to all the chiefs of the king's party, with full assu∣rance of paradise to every man who should fall in battle against the enemies of the church; so that even the common soldiers fought with surprising ala∣crity and resolution.</P>

<P>Lewis had recommenced the siege of Dover, in which he was em∣ployed when he received the unwelcome tidings of this disaster: he forthwith abandoned his enterprize, and returned to London, in order to take some imme∣diate measures for repairing the damage he had sustained. He dispatched let∣ters to his father, solliciting a speedy r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>insorcement, without which he said he should not be able to re-establish his affairs. Philip, loth to embroil himself fur∣ther with the pope, affected to disclaim his proceedings, and declared in public that Lewis must extricate himself as well as he could from the difficulties in which he was involved; but, at the same time, he enabled Blanche, his daughter-in∣law, to equip an armament, in her own name, for the relief of her husband; and a strong body of forces embarked at Calais for England. The commanders of the fleet fitted out by the Cinque-Ports, in the king's service, being informed of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se preparations, waited for the French transports in the channel, and attacking them in the passage, took or sunk the greatest part of the armament. This misfortune was the more sensibly felt by Lewis, as the English army ap∣proached London, in which he immediately found himself blocked up by the regent, without any hope of relief: the people now expressed their dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntent
<PB N="460" REF="4690"/>
without reserve; the chief barons of his alliance were taken prisoners at Lin∣coin; the rest had either abandoned his party or were suspected of disa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iection; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thunder began to sound terrible in his ears; his enemies were mast∣ers of the sea; and he himself was besieged in a foreign country, cut off from all sources of s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccour and supply. In this forlorn situation, he demanded an hono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable peace of the regent, which should comprehend his allies, by whom he had been invited to England; otherwise he would listen to no terms of ac∣commodation. The earl of Pembroke granted his request, without hesitation, being equally unwilling to incur the resentment of Philip, who would have doubtless exerted the whole power of France to save his son from destruction; and to drive the barons to despair, by which the nation might be involved in new troubles. Conferences were immediately begun, and in a little time a treaty of peace was concluded, on condition that all the adherents of Lewis should be re-established in the rights and possessions they enjoyed before the troubles; that the antient pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vileges of the city of London should be preserved; that all the prisoners taken since the arrival of Lewis should be released, and com∣missaries apointed to regulate the terms upon which the rest should be ran∣somed or exchanged; that all the English, without distinction, who had re∣volted against John, should take the oath of allegiance to Henry; that the hostages delivered to Lewis for the ransom of prisoners, should be set at li∣berty, upon payment of the money; that all the places, towns, and castles, occupied by Lewis in England, should be surrendered to king Henry; that the king of Scotland might be comprehended in this treaty, on restoring all that he had seized during the war; and that the same restitution should be made to him by the English monarch; that the prince of Wales should enjoy the benefit of the same stipulation; that Lewis should relinquish all the isles, which were occupied in his name; and renounce the homage which had been payed to him by the subjects of England. Besides these public articles, Lewis promised to employ all his influence with his father, that the foreign<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub. Mezera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. M. Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> dominions belonging to the royal family might be restored; and that, in case he should not succeed in his remonstrances on this subject, he would make the restitution at his own accession to the throne of France.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The treaty being signed, ratified and confirmed by the pope's legate, Lewis received absolution, and set sail for France, after having borrowed five thousand marks of the city of London for the payment of his debts; and he was no sooner embarked than Henry made his public entrance into London, where he was received with great pomp and universal satisfaction. Then he swore to maintain the nation in all its privileges; and in this voluntary oath the barons obtained more solid advantages than ever they could have ex∣pected from the victories of a foreign prince, by which in all appearance they would have effectually been enslaved. Of all the adherents of Lewis, the cler∣gy were the only persons who suffered by this pacification. Nothing had been stipulated in their favour, except a restitution of the lay-fees which they pos∣sessed; so that they were left exposed to all the terrors of ecclesiastical censure. The pope had been very much mortified to find his sentences despised by the laity; but he was implacably incensed against the churchmen who had re∣belled against his authority. The legate therefore, being now at liberty to act against those rebellious ecclesiastics, set on foot a severe inquiry all over
<PB N="461" REF="4700"/>
the kingdom, by which he learned the names of those who had disobeyed the interbict; and they being convicted of this unpardonable crime against the ma∣jesty of the pope, were suspended, deprived, or obliged to attone their guilt with great sums of money. The king of Scotland, who had been excommuni∣cated for doing homage to Lewis, claimed the benefit of the treaty; and re∣pairing to Northampton, received absolution of the legate, after having sworn fealty to king Henry for the fiefs he possessed in England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>It was not without great difficulty that the regent executed the treaty which had been made with Lewis. The barons who had served the late king could not, without great reluctance, part with the lands of the revolt∣ers, which had been granted to them by John as a recompence for their attach∣ment; and the clergy complained loudly of having been abandoned to the per∣secutions of the Roman see. Nevertheless, the earl of Pembroke, seeing no other possibil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of restoring the peace of the kingdom, than that of punctually executing the articles of convention, insisted upon the immediate restitution of the alienated lands, and even compelled Robert Gawgy by force of arms to restore the castle of Nottingham to the bishop of Lincoln its former owner. The rest, submitted without compulsion; and as for the clergy, he could not in∣termeddle<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1218.</NOTE> in their affairs, without embroiling himself with the pope, whose pro∣tection was very necessary to the interests of Henry. Far from opposing his measures, he, at the desire of the legate, published a proclamation, enjoining all excommunicated ecclesiastics who had not received absolution to quit the king∣dom, on pain of imprisonment; so that they were obliged to compound with the legate for the removal of his censures. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. Brady.</NOTE></P>
<P>All the troubles of the nation being now happily appeased, the regent sent or∣ders to all the magistrates of the kingdom, to execute the two charters of king John, and punish all those who should refuse to conform to the articles contained in these constitutions. The earl of Pembroke acted, in all respects, like a great and good man, warmly attached to the interest of his country: in order to spare the subjects the expence of men and money, for the reduction of Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had acted as an auxiliary of the barons, he proposed honourable terms of accommodation, which were embraced by that prince, who was after∣wards absolved by the legate, through the earl's intercession. This was the last<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>In a little time after Gualo's departure, the nation sustained an irre∣parable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1220.</NOTE> loss, by the death of the regent, whose valour, integrity, and pru∣dence, had preserved it from slavery; he was succeeded by William de Roches, bishop of Winchester; and Hubert de Burgh, the defender of Dover, was created chief justiciary of England. As the king's coronation at Winchester had been performed in a defective and informal manner, it was thought proper to repeat the ceremony, in which cardinal Langton officiated, that prelate having, by this time, been freed from the suspension, in consequence of which he had quitted the kingdom. Immediately after the coronation, Hen∣ry, with his new regent, made a progress through the different counties of the kingdom, in order to enquire into the management of the servants belonging to the crown, and remove such governors as were thought averse to the pre∣sent administration. None of these made any opposition to the king's will,
<PB N="462" REF="4710"/>
except William de Albemarle, castellan of Rockingham, who had erected himself into a sovereign, and affected to despise the orders of the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1221.</NOTE> He at first refused to resign his employment, and put himself in a posture of defence; but finding that all his neighbours offered their service to assist the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

After this expedition, the king returned to Lon∣don, where, with his own hand, he laid the first stone of the new abbey church of Westminster, which remains to this day. In the course of this year, the pope canonized Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, who died in the beginning of John's reign, and was said to have performed miracles; and Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, inspired with the most profound veneration for his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>decessor Thomas Becket, whose genius was congenial with his own, ordered the body of that apostle to be removed from the stone-coffin and vault, in which it was first interred, to a rich shrine of gold, beset with precious stones. This ceremony was performed in presence of the king, and Pandulf, the pope's legate, with almost all the prelates and nobility of England, surrounded by an incredible multitude of people, a great number of whom arrived from<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while William de Albemarle, thinking himself injured in the affair of Rockingham, instead of obeying the king's order, when summoned to a general council at Westminster assembled on national affairs, raised a body of troops, with which he surprised the castle of Fotheringay in Nor∣thamptonshire. Leaving a strong garrison in the place, he returned to his own habitation at Biham, which he fortified against all opposition, obliging all mer∣chants and travellers that passed through the neighbourhood, to pay for his passports, on pain of being plundered by his detachments. The great coun∣cil, informed of these violent and illegal proceedings, summoned him to ap∣pear and justify his conduct; and he refusing to obey, assembled an army to besiege the castle, resolving to punish him with all the severity of the law. William, understanding that the troops were in march again him, retired to the northern parts of the kingdom, leaving the command of Biham to a go∣vernor, who did not surrender until he was reduced to the utmost extremity: he himself afterwards found means to make his peace with the regent, who, at the intercession of the archbishop of York, forgave his revolt, in considera∣tion of his services to the late king. This disturbance being quelled, the king m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rched against Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had invested the castle of Buelt, belonging to Reginald de Braouse; but he relinquished his enterprize, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at the approa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of Henry, who pursued him to Montgomery, where a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le was built to prevent future incursions. It was after his return from this expedition, that the king's sister Joane, who had been betrothed to the son of earl Marche, was removed from the custody of that nobleman, and married <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t York to Alexander, king of Scotland. That prince's sister, about the<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me time, espoused Hubert de Burgh, justiciary of England; a match by which he incurred the envy and jealousy of some noblemen, who took all op∣portunities to disturb him in the execution of his office. Among these were William, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl of Salisb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and Rainulf, earl of Chester, who being sus∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gn to excite new troubles, the archbi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop of Canterbury assem∣bled a counc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at London, where he effected a reconciliation between the earls

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The tranquillity of the nation was not yet so firmly established, but that some turbulent individuals took all occasions to excite civil broils and com∣motions; nor was the party of Lewis as yet quite extinguished in the realm, as appeared about this period in a riot at Westminster. The citizens of Lon∣don having obtained the prize in a wrestling-match, appointed by the stew∣ard belonging to the abbot of Westminster, this man repined at the glory which had been won from his tenants, and resolved to revenge the disgrace. With this view, he proposed a second contention, and a ram as the prize of the victors; the Londoners flocked in great numbers to this diversion, and were suddenly attacked by the steward, and a band of armed rustics, whom he had assembled for the purpose. The citizens, being repulsed with great indignity, and a good number of them wounded in the fray, resolved to take immediate vengeance upon the perfidious steward, and took to their arms in a very tumultuous manner: Serle the mayor endeavoured to quell the com∣motion, and advised them to complain to the abbot, from whom they would receive proper satisfaction; but this expedient was opposed by Constantine Fitz-Arnulf, a rich, turbulent, and popular citizen, who had distinguished himself as a partisan of Lewis and the barons. As he loved to fish in troubled waters, was ambitious of commanding the multitude, and believed that this disturbance might produce something that would revive the civil dissensions of the nation, he harrangued the rioters, and having inflamed their passions, proposed that they should march against the abbot and his steward, and raze their houses to the ground. The scheme being applauded, he put himself at their head, and proceeded to Westminster, exclaiming Mon joye St. Denis! which was the war word of the French; and having demolished several houses belonging to the abbey, returned to the city in triumph. Hubert de Burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1222.</NOTE> the justiciary, being informed of this outrage, aggravated by the traiterous ex∣pressions of Constantine and the populace, repaired directly to the Tower with a body of troops, and summoned the citizens to appear and answer for those riotous proceedings: Constantine going thither with great confidence, boldly justified what he had done; declared he would repeat the same conduct on the like occasion; and pleaded the indemnity which had been stipulated for the partisans of Lewis, by the treaty of pacification. Hubert gave him to under∣stand, that nothing was stipulated in favour of those who should commit acts of sedition; and that he, with his two chief accomplices, should be hanged next morning. This sentence was accordingly executed, notwithstanding his offer to redeem his life with fifteen thousand marks of silver; and many citizens, concerned in the tum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt, were punished with the amputation of their hands and feet: nay, the king further expressed his resentment against the city, by turning the magistrates out of their offices, and appointing others by his sole authority.</P>

<P>This exercise of severity raised an universal clamour among the peo∣ple; especially as it was practised in direct opposition to the charters which had been so lately confirmed; for the punishments were inflicted by the arbitrary sentence of Hubert, without any previous trial or legal conviction. Lewis affected to complain of it as an insringement of the peace, insomuch that,
<PB N="464" REF="4730"/>
when he ascended the throne of France, he made this transaction a pretence<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

So absolute was the royal power, at this period, that the king exacted hostages for the peaceable behaviour of the citizens; and thirty of the principal inhabitants being nominated for this purpose, the corpo∣ration obliged themselves, by an authentic deed, to deliver them up whenever they should be demanded. This exertion of despotic power, however, gave such umbrage to the nation in general, that, in a subsequent assembly held at Oxford, the members insisted upon the king's executing the charters, to the observance of which he had solemnly sworn. The court had, since the death of William, earl of Pembroke, adopted new maxims; and when this address was presented to the king, William Bruvere, one of his courtiers, said it was unr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asonable to demand the performance of charters, which had been extorted by force. The archbishop of Canterbury, startled at this rash declaration, replied, that if he really loved the king, whose interests he pretended so warmly to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spouse, he would not seek to reinvolve the kingdom in fresh troubles; and Henry himself, being then in the sixteenth year of his age, seconded Langton, and assured the deputies of his firm intention to observe the charters with the utmost punctuality. He accordingly issued orders all over the kingdom, for the exact execution of all the articles; and the assembly was so well pleased with his behaviour on this occasion, that they indulged him with a very con∣siderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">M P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE> subsidy, that he might be enabled to relieve the christians in the Holy Land.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1223.</NOTE> Philip Augustus, king of France, dying during these transactions, Henry's council sent over ambassadors, to congratulate Lewis on his accession to the throne, and remind him of his promise touching Normandy, and the other dominions of which John had been deprived by his father; but he gave them to understand, that he looked upon himself as acquitted of that obliga∣tion, by Henry's having first infringed the articles of the treaty, in exacting exorbitant ransom from the prisoners, neglecting to re-establish the antient laws, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cording to the convention, and in putting Constantine to death, for his attachment to the French interest. In this manner did the arbitrary dispo∣sition of the justiciary injure his master, abroad as well as at home, where he assumed a prerogative, to which none of his predecessors in that employment had ever aspired: nor was he contented with the great share of power and au∣thority which he engrossed, as being still obliged to receive orders from the bishop of Winchester, who had been declared regent of the kingdom, during the minority of Henry. Hubert, in order to abridge the term of this pre∣late's office, obtained a bull from the pope, declaring the king of age, au∣thorizing him to take the reins of government in his own hands, and enjoin∣ing all those who fil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d offices to resign them to their sovereign, that he might dispose of them as he should think proper. This mandate the barons absolutely refused to obey, because it was directly contrary to the laws of the kingdom, which limited the king's minority to the age of one and twenty.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>Hubert, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us disappointed, contrived another stratagem, which su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeded according to his expe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation; he persuaded the king to demand of him the fortresses which were in his custody, and actually surrendered the Tower of London and Dover-castle, the two most important places of the
<PB N="465" REF="4740"/>
realm; a good number of the barons followed his example, and found them∣selves outwitted by the craft of the justiciary, to whom his governments were restored, as soon as the king was in possession of their castles. Such a mean collusion, not only provoked them against Henry, but also impressed them with an unfavourable opinion of his morals. They considered his favourite as the author of this unworthy contrivance: those who enjoyed offices at court, unable to bear the insolence of the justiciary, resigned their places, and retired to their respective homes, resolving to embrace the first opportunity of ex∣pressing their resentment in a more effectual manner. Such barons as had not fallen into the snare, Hubert endeavoured to intimidate, by threatening them with the sentence of excommunication; and some of them were thus ter∣rified into compliance; but others despised these menaces, and resolved to maintain their rights and property, against all the efforts of the king and his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abb. de Cogg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M.

The principal malecontents were the earls of Chester and Albe∣marle, Fulk de Bryant, and Robert de Vipont; these, with some other barons, held a council at Leicester, in order to concert measures for their mutual defence, and refused to appear at a general assembly convened at Nor∣thampton, where the archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans fulminated a sentence of excommunication against all disturbers of the public peace; and threatened them, in particular, with that sentence from the pope, unless they would immediately resign the castles belonging to the crown, which were in their custody. The censures of the church were so formidable, that, rather than incur them, these noblemen submitted, and gave up the fortresses, though they did not lay aside their enmity to the justiciary, nor the desire of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>Lewis was well informed of these intestine commotions, which seemed to be the prelude of a new rebellion, that might turn out to his advantage: mean while, instead of fulfilling the articles of the peace, which he had sworn to observe, he confiscated all the lands belonging to English noblemen in his dominions, and marched into Saintonge, where he made himself master of divers places: then he invested Rochelle, which was immediately surrendered by Savary Maulion, who embraced the interest of France, out of resentment to the English government, which, when he demanded a supply in money, sent him a chest full of old iron. This unprovoked invasion, which Lewis cloaked with the frivolous pretence of Henry's having omitted to appear at his consecration, plainly demonstrated the necessity of sending an army abroad; and a general assembly was convoked at Northampton, to consider upon ways and means to equip an armament equal to an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterprize of such importance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil.</NOTE> Their deliberations were interrupted by the excesses of Fulk de Bryant, who, in imitation of William de Albemarle, had erected himself into a palatine, and levied contributions upon the open country, in the neighbourhood of his castle at Bedford. Complaints had been made of his tyranny; and three judges being sent down to Dunstaple, to take cognizance of his conduct, amerced him in one hundred pounds sterling, in lieu of damages to the people whom he had oppressed. Incensed at this determination, he detached his brother William, with a body of troops, to apprehend the judges, two of whom escaped; but the third, whose name was Henry de Baybrook, being taken, was con∣veyed to Bedford, and treated with the utmost indignity. The assembly
<PB N="466" REF="4750"/>
at Northampton, being informed of this violence, unanimously resolved to make an example of this perturbator of the public peace, and suspended all other deliberations, until he should be punished for his audacious behaviour, Forces were levied for that purpose, and Fulk was summoned to surrender the castle; but, instead of obeying the order, he retired into Wales, in hope of being joined by other malecontents, who had promised to support him in his revolt, and left the castle to the charge of his brother, who after a desperate resistance, was obliged to surrender at discretion. Notwithstanding the inter∣cession of his friends, who sollicited the king in his behalf with unwearied im∣portunity, he was hanged, with four and twenty knights who were found in the place, and the castle itself levelled with the ground. Fulk, seeing himself disappointed of the succours he expected to receive, had recourse to the king's clemency, through the intercession of the bishop of Coventry: and Henry, in consideration of the services he performed to his father, granted him his life; but he was committed to the custody of the bishop of London, till the year following, when, by an act of the general council, his estate was confiscated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>They had granted a small subsidy for this expedition; but, as a great sum was necessary for the support of the war against France, another ge∣neral<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The assembly promised to grant this subsidy, provided the king would order the charters of John to be more punctually observed; and he forthwith appointed commissaries to visit the different counties, and see the articles duly executed: a concession which operated so favourably on the minds of the people, that the tax was paid with great chearfulness; and the bishops excommunicated all those who should commit any frauds in the collection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Waverl. Act. Public.</NOTE> The Cistercians added to their proportion a free gift of two thousand marks; and the Jews presented the king with five thousand, for his favour and pro∣tection. Thus supplied, the king levied an army, and equipped a fleet for an expedition into Guienne, under the command of his brother Richard, whom he had knighted and created earl of Cornwal. That young prince, accom∣panied by the earl of Salisbury and Philip d'Albiney, set sail from England with a fleet of three hundred ships; and landing at Bourdeaux, was joined by a great number of adventurers whom he took into his service. Thus reinforced, he marched into Guienne, where he reduced several places, and, at last, in∣vested the castle of La Reole, which being strongly fortified, held out until the count de la Marche, general of the French army, advanced to its relief. Richard, being too weak to hazard a battle, abandoned the siege, and retreated to the other side of the river Dourdogne; and while he remained on the con∣tinent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egord.</NOTE> he attempted nothing further of any importance.</P>

<P>During these transactions in Guienne, Otho arrived as pope's legate; and an assembly being convoked at his desire, while the king lay dan∣gerously ill at Marlborough, he made a very extraordinary proposal, in the name of his holiness. He began his harrangue, by observing that the holy see had long lain under the reproach of selling her favours for money; and that it
<PB N="467" REF="4760"/>
was the duty of all good christians to remove the cause of that imputation, which was no other than the extreme indigence of the Roman church. He therefore proposed, that in order to relieve the pressing necessities of the holy see, and enable it to distribute its indulgences with generosity and mode∣ration, two prebends in every cathedral, and as many cells in every convent of England, should be granted to the pope, by an authentic deed, confirmed by an act of the general assembly. This demand was so unconscionable, that the council, far from complying with it, would not even deign to answer the legate, until he complained of being treated with disrespect; then they told him, that the absence of the king and some principal members, would not permit them to deliberate upon a proposal of that nature. Otho, with a perseverance which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1226.</NOTE> was truly pontifical, desired them to continue the session, until his majesty and the absent members should arrive; but they paid no regard to his intreaties, and broke up without even conferring upon the subject: so that he found him∣self obliged to exert his patience till another opportunity. During this inter∣val, he made a progress into the north, where, under pretence of the right of procurations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a right, which legates had to free entertainment, while they visited churches and monasteries; which entertainment they now commuted for money.</NOTE>, he fleeced and harrassed the churches in such a manner, that the clergy complained of him to the pope, who recalled him immediately, rather than run the risque of exasperating the English at such a conjuncture. At the same time, he directed the archbishop of Canterbury to procure ano∣ther convocation of the assembly, and demand a positive answer to the pro∣position which had been made by the legate. His mandate was obeyed by Langton; and the king, with the advice of his prelates, declared to his holi∣ness, that, as the affair concerned all Christendom as well as England, he would<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> conform to the resolutions of his neighbour potentates. Mean while, Hen∣ry continued his preparations against France, until he was obliged to interrupt them on account of the crusade against the Albegenses, which Lewis undertook to command in person, while the pope expresly forbade all christian princes to invade his dominions, to the prejudice of this expedition. Henry, by the ad∣vice of his council, resolved therefore to postpone all hostilities until the return of the French king, who was, by this time, employed in the siege of Avignon; after the reduction of which he died, not without suspicion of being poisoned by the count de Champagne, who loved his queen to distraction. Lewis IX. succeeded his father, under the tuition of Blanche of Castile, who, though a foreigner, had interest enough to be declared regent of the kingdom.</P>

<P>In the mean time, Henry of England having been de∣clared of age, before the time fixed by the laws of the realm, he began his reign with a sample of government which impressed the people with a very unfavourable opinion of his character. As he could not demand money from the assembly, after the large subsidies he had so lately received, he resolved to revive an expedient which had been practised by his uncle Richard, after his return from Palestine. This was an order commanding all persons who enjoyed charters to pay a certain tax for their being renewed and confirmed; a griev∣ance of which the monasteries, and the nation in general, loudly complained: not that the king himself was so much blamed for this extortion, as the justi∣ciary,

<P>This conduct of the king and his minister produced an universal sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit of dissa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isfaction among the barons; and prince Richard, lately arrived from Guienne, took the advantage of this alienation to insult his brother, in conse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence of a quarrel about a German whose name was Walleran, on whom king John had bestowed some lands in Cornwal. When Richard received the investiture of this county, he summoned Walleran to produce his title; and in the mean time seized his estate. The German, instead of shewing his charter, complained to the king, in his brother's absence; and an order was issued for putting him in possession of his lands. The vassals and agents of the earl eluded the execution of this order till the return of Richard, who assured the king that he had no intention to injure Walleran; and that he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld refer the dispute to the judgment of his peers. Henry, incensed at this declaration, which he construed into an appeal from his determination, chid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im severely for his presumption, and commanded him to restore the lands
<PB N="469" REF="4780"/>
or quit the kingdom immediately. Richard replied that he would neither do the one nor the other, without the decision of his peers; and immediately retired to his own house. The justiciary advised the king to arrest him without de∣lay; but, while he wavered in his resolution, the earl set out for Marlborough, where he communicated the transaction to William Mareschal, earl of Pem∣broke, who approved of his behaviour, and undertook to form an association for humbling the pride of the justiciary. With this view they visited the earl of Che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, and some other noblemen, who embraced their plan without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sitation, and appointed a rendezvous at Stamford, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e met by the earls of Gloucester, Warenne, Hereford, Ferrars, and War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, with a great number of gentlemen, attended by a vast multitude of armed vassals. There they published a manifesto, containing their grievances; and demanded the confirmation of the charters, together with the dismission of Hubert from the king's councils. The justiciary foreseeing the dangerous consequences that might ensue from this insurrection, advised the king to convoke a general assembly at Northampton, with promise to redress the grievances of the na∣tion; and in the mean time, to detach prince Richard from the confederacy, by ceding in his favour some claims to the effects of his mother, and adding to his appointments the lands which the count de Boulogne had possessed in England. These seasonable concessions operated so effectually upon the mind of the earl, that he renounced his engagements with the nobility, who, finding themselves thus berest of their leader, laid aside their design, and submitted to the king, on his promise to govern according to the laws of the realm.</P>

<P>About this period Gregory IX. succeeded to the papacy, at the death<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1228<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> of Honorius III. who was survived but a few months by Stephen Langton, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hbishop of Canterbury. This prelate's eyes were no sooner closed than the monks of St. Augustin, in order to preserve their privilege, elected one of their brothers, called Walter de Hemisham, without even demanding the king's permission. Henry therefore refused to confirm his election, on pretence of his father's having been hang'd for felony; and the suffragans of Canterbury, who likewise pretended to the right of election, found a pretext for refusing to own this new archbishop, who it seems had debauched a nun, by whom he had several children. Agents were sent with appeals to Rome; but the pope declined deciding the dispute, until he should be better informed of the parti∣culars; and in the mean time the see remained vacant. His holiness at that time could not attend to such petty contests, so much was he engrossed by his quarrel with Frederic II. emperor of Germany, whom he now excommuni∣cated for having deferred his voyage to the Holy Land, according to the oath he had taken. This sentence excited such commotions in Germany and Italy, that Frederic was obliged to perform his vow. France was at the same time embroiled by the regency of Blanche; and had Henry been an enterprizing prince, he might have taken the advantage of this conjuncture, to retrieve his paternal possessions on the continent. The Normans, who had engaged in the interest of the French barons, against the regency, assured the king of England, that if he would cross the seas, they would receive him with open arms. The Poitevins pressed him to take possession of their country; in which ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they would assist him in expelling the French garrisons; and the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cons deputed the archbishop of Bourdeaux to invite him to come and re∣cover

the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heritance of Guienne. Such pressing invitations one would ima∣gine should have been very acceptable to any prince of common courage and discretion; especially to one who had no domestic troubles to fear: for Henry had just concluded a peace with Llewellyn, a prince of Wales, who had made some incursions upon the English borders. Nevertheless, he declined their pro∣posals, observing he would chuse a more proper opportunity; whereas, such another could not be expected during the whole course of his reign; and he afterwards rashly undertook the expedition, without the least probability of success.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er. M. Paris.</NOTE> Mean while, the pope still delayed giving judgment in the dispute concerning the archbishopric of Canterbury, until the king's envoys made an offer to the pope of the tenth of all moveables in England and Ireland. This proposition threw a new light upon the contest, and his holiness immediately annulled the election of the monks; but, at the same time he arrogated to himself the power of filling up the vacancy, appointing by his own autho∣rity Richard le Grant, chancellor of the church of Lincoln, to the archiepis∣copal dignity; and this prelate was recognized by the king and the suffragans, who on this occasion betrayed the rights of the Anglican church. In a little time after this transaction, the pope sent over one of his chaplains to collect the promised tythe, in order to support a war against the emperor; and he presented the pontiff's letter to the great council of the kingdom, desiring that this aid might be levied without delay. All the members were astonished at the proposal, and turned their eyes upon the king, expecting that he would disclaim the conduct of his envoys, who had made such an extravagant pro∣mise: but they soon perceived by his silence, that the offer had been made by his direction; and, in the first transports of their indignation, resolved that their vassals should not be exposed to any such exaction. Nevertheless, as a mark of their respect to his holiness, they agreed to grant him a donation, without proceeding to an inquiry into the effects of individuals. They were, however, diverted from executing this resolution, by the behaviour of Stephen Seagrave, one of the richest and most popular members of the assembly, who voluntarily submitted to the tax; and a great number was influenced by his example, till at last the whole council, including ecclesiastics as well as lay∣men, acquies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the demand, rather than incur the wrath of the king, and the censures of Gregory. This point being settled, the nuncio produced a commission investing him with full power to levy the tax upon all moveables whatsoever. He forthwith proceeded to the execution of his orders, and ex∣acted the tythe with such rigour, that the people were obliged to pay ready money for the fruits of the earth even while growing: the prelates and abbots were compelled to advance the tax for their inferior clergy; and, as they could not conveniently raise the sums demanded, they were supplied by Italian usurers, whom the nuncio had brought along with him for this purpose. The earl of Chester, however, insisted upon his prerogative of palatine, and would not suffer the nuncio, or any of his agents, to set foot within his terri∣tories.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>staple. M.

<P>Before the people had time to breathe, after this grievous burden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He summoned all the nobility and gentlemen of England to attend him at Portsmouth, immediately after Michaelmas, where they assembled to a vast multitude, from all parts of the kingdom, besides a great number of volunteers from Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. But, all the suc∣cess that might have been expected from such an army was prevented by the neglect of the justiciary, who had not provided a sufficient number of vessels for its transportation. Henry is said to have been so much incensed at this omission, that he drew his sword, in order to sacrifice Hubert with his own hand, and was hardly witheld by the noblemen who interposed. This is a circumstance very incompatible with the disposition of the king, who stood in awe of the justiciary, and could scarce have been provoked to such an effort of resolution. The enterprize seems to have been postponed for want of money to pay such a multitude of soldiers, and in consequence of what was suggested by the count of Brittany, who had by this time arrived at Ports∣mouth, in order to conduct the expedition; and dissuaded the king from hazarding a voyage in the winter season. The troops were accordingly dis∣missed; and the count having obtained a grant of the honour of Richmond, with a supply of five thousand marks in ready money, returned to his own country, where he published a manifesto representing his grievances, and renouncing his allegiance to the king of France.</P>

<P>The expedition being thus postponed, Henry made a progress to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Then he convoked an assembly, and obtained a considerable scutage for defraying the expence of another armament. The rendezvous of his army was appointed at Reading, for the beginning of April; from thence he marched to Portsmouth, and embarking about the latter end of the same month, arrived at St. Malo. There he was received by the count, who surrendered several strong places into his hands; and a great number of the nobility did homage to him as their sovereign. The king of France had already taken Angers, in the neighbourhood of which his army was posted to observe the motions of the English, and oppose their irruption into Poitou; but seeing Henry did not move from Nantes, he advanced towards Amiens on the Loire, which he invested and took, together with several places in the neighbourhood of Henry's quarters, without meeting with the least interrup∣tion from that prince, who spent his time in feasting and riot, as if he had crossed the sea to take his diversion. Notwithstanding the prudent administra∣tion of the queen regent of France, the discontented noblemen, in hope of being sustained by Henry, took this opportunity of their own king's absence, to excite fresh commotions, which obliged Lewis to quit Anjou, that he might reduce those malecontents; and this was a favourable juncture for Henry, to recover the dominions which his father had lost. The king of France had withdrawn his forces, and the Normans earnestly sollicited the king of Eng∣land to take possession of their country; but, instead of marching into Nor∣mandy, he entered Poitou, where he made himself master of Mire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau; then repaired to Guienne, to receive the homage of the Gascon barons; and, lastly,
<PB N="472" REF="4810"/>
returned into Brittany, where he relapsed into his former indolence, as if he had restricted himself by oath from interrupting Lewis, in the pacification of his realms. His conduct was so amazingly impolitic and absurd on this occasion, that his ministers were suspected of carrying on an intelligence with the enemy; and Lewis effected an accomodation with the confederated ba∣rons, who saw they had nothing to expect from the assistance of England. By this time Henry was heartily tired of the war, and his forces daily dimi∣nishing from intemperance, he agreed to leave four hundred knights, and a body of horse, to assist the count of Brittany, while he should maintain the war with France, and to remit six thousand marks for his service, as soon as he should arrive in England. His resolution to quit Britanny was hastened by the mo∣tions of the French king and the regent, who having appeased the intestine troubles of France, marched back to oppose the English; and Henry, at their approach, embarked suddenly for England. Yet the earls of Chester, Albemarle, and Pembroke, who were left behind with the troops above∣mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer. M. Paris.

<P>During Henry's absence Ireland had been involved in troubles. The king of Connaught knowing the best of the English troops were with∣drawn from that kingdom, to serve in the expedition against Brittany, re∣solved to take the advantage of their absence, and assembling a vast number of vassals, invaded the lands of the British proprietors, which he wasted with fire and sword, until he was encountred by Geoffrey de Marisco, justiciary of Ireland, who took him prisoner, after having routed his army with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1231.</NOTE> slaughter. This event in some measure consoled the nation for the miscarriage of Henry's foreign expedition, which he had so disgracefully mismanaged; and yet he used it as a pretext for raising further subsidies. He had exhausted his finances abroad in such an extravagant manner, that he was a meer beggar at his return; and what the great council would have refused to his demand at another time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they now granted to his indigence. There was nothing affable or engaging in the character of Henry; so that he never could attach a noble∣man to his interest by the ties of affection: but, as he seized all opportunities of exerting the odious prerogatives of his royalty, Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, having complained to him of the behaviour of Hubert de Burgh, who had seized the castle of Tunbridge, tho' it was a fief of the archbishopric, he replied, that the young earl of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oucester being a ward of the crown, he had a right to dispose of the castle during his minority; and that Richard was presumpt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous in pretending to dispute that privilege. The archbishop, incensed at this reproachful refus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, excommunicated without distinction all<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> those who detain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects of the church, and set out immediately for Rome to claim the protection of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P>Henry's imperious disposition was about this time manifested in another difference with one of the first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his kingdom.

services, the king seized the estate as soon as he received the news of the bro∣ther's death; and a truce being afterwards concluded with France, Richard returned to England, and demanded the succession. Henry at first pretended, that the late earl's widow was pregnant; but that allegation being disproved, he charged Richard with having carried on a treasonable correspondence with the enemy; and ordered him to quit the kingdom in fifteen days. Such an arbi∣trary and unjust sentence must have incensed any English nobleman; but it was particularly provoking to the son of that earl of Pembroke who had placed the crown on his head, and supported him against all the efforts of his ene∣mies. Richard obeyed the order literally, in quitting the kingdom; but he retired into Ireland, where he took possession of the lands belonging to his fa∣mily; and assembling a body of troops, ravaged the crown demesnes, and thus made himself amends for the damage he had sustained. This was the most ef∣fectual way of dealing with a prince of Henry's character. Alarmed at Richard's progress, he recalled him from exile, restored his estate, and invest∣ed him with the office of earl mareschal, which his brother had enjoyed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>Henry was timorous, rash, and irresolute in every part of his conduct. Lllewellyn, prince of Wales, having renewed his incursions, the king allowed him to ravage the borders with impunity; and, after he had re∣turned with his plunder, marched against him, at the head of a numerous ar∣my: but, he no sooner met with difficulties and opposition, than his ardour cooled, and he returned, without having reduced the enemy, or done any thing worthy of notice. The same inconstancy and irresolution appeared in the dif∣ferent schemes of matrimony which he projected. He was now in the twenty∣fifth year of his age, and had proposed marriage to several princesses: he had engaged himself by oath to Yolante, daughter of the count of Brittany; he had demanded the daughter of the duke of Austria; he had expressed a desire of uniting himself closely with the empire, by means of a match with a princess of Bohemia; and now he resolved to espouse the second daughter of William, late king of Scotland. All these alliances miscarried, through Henry's own levity, except the last, which was prevented by the remonstrances of the nobi∣lity, who represented the disgrace that would attend his marriage with the younger sister of his justiciary's wife. He in the sequel proposed marriage to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, who had repaired to Rome with complaints against John and his justiciary, concerning the castle of Tun∣bridge, did not meet with the success he expected: Henry had sent over an agent to justify his conduct; and the pope, whose interest it was to oblige this weak prince, issued a bull, forbidding the prelates of England to excommuni∣cate the king's ministers and officers, for maintaining the rights of the crown to castles and other possessions. Richard dying, on his return the monks of Canterbury proceeded immediately to a new election, and chose Ralf de Ne∣ville, bishop of Chichester and chancellor of the kingdom, to fill the vacant see; a choice so agreeable to the king, that he forthwith approved of the election, and put him in possession of the temporalities; yet he could not ob∣tain
<PB N="474" REF="4830"/>
the confirmation of the pope, to whom Simon Langton represented him as a prelare devoted to the prerogatives of the crown, in opposition to the autho∣rity of the Roman church. His election was therefore set aside; and the monks were ordered to choose another, who being as disagreeable to his holi∣ness as Ralf, they pitched upon a third, who was likewise rejected, and at last elected Edmund, treasurer of the church of Salisbury, who was chosen by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Paris.</NOTE> pope's own recommendation.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The court of Rome had by this time used its influence in such an unpopular manner, that a general clamour arose all over England, against the practice of bestowing benefices upon Italian priests, and inhibiting English bi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hops and lay patrons to present natives, until those foreigners should be pre∣ferred. This was considered as a national insult and grievance, and a number of associations were formed for delivering the kingdom from such shameful op∣pression. Circular letters were sent to bishops and chapters, warning them against favouring such encroachments, on pain of having their houses burned, and their farms destroyed. Cincio, a Roman prebendary of St. Paul's, was apprehended, in the neighbourhood of St. Alban's, by a number of men in vi∣zards, who confined him for five weeks, and obliged him to pay a considerable ransom for his liberty: the barns of the Italian clergy were broke open, and their corn either given to the poor, or sold in public; and when the civil ma∣gistrate interposed, counterfeit warrants were produced by the rioters, who ge∣nerally appeared to the number of fourscore, on all such occasions. In this manner they proceeded for some time, without opposition, and the foreign ec∣clesiastics took refuge in convents, for the security of their persons. The pope being informed of this violence, wrote a letter to the king, insisting upon his punishing the delinquents with the utmost rigour; otherwise he would excom∣municate his person, and lay his dominions under an interdict. Henry, startled at these menaces, appointed inquisitions in different parts of the kingdom, where those disorders had prevailed; and it soon appeared, that they had been countenanced by every rank and degree of people in the kingdom. Bishops, abbots, knights, sheriffs, and esquires, were found to have been concerned as accessories or abettors, and the justiciary himself was suspected of having con∣nived at the pillage, and screened the rioters from persecution. At last, Ro∣bert<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1232.</NOTE> de Twange, a gallant young knight, who, under the name of W. Wither, had headed them in their excursions, appeared in the king's presence, and owned himself the ringleader in all these expeditions against the Romans, who, he said, had endeavoured to deprive him of the only patronage he enjoyed. Henry was pleased with his appearance and frank confession; and as the bishop of London and another prelate had excommunicated all concerned in those riots, he sent him to Rome, with letters recommending him to the pope's indul∣gence.</P>

<P>Though this young adventurer fully cleared Hubert of all suspi∣cion, his professed enemy Peter de Roches, bishop of Winchester, insinuated to the pope, that the justiciary was actually concerned in the outrages com∣mitted against the Italian clergy; and by these insinuations added the influence of his holiness to the confederacy which was already formed at court to the prejudice of Hubert. This nobleman had, by his pride and arbitrary disposi∣tion, not only disgusted almost all the peers of the realm, but also become dis∣agreeable
<PB N="475" REF="4840"/>
to the king, whose fickleness disposed him to novelty and alteration in ministers as well as measures. The justiciary's enemies no sooner sound Henry's ears open to their representations, than they assiduously calumniated the conduct and character of the minister: they prevailed upon the king to re∣call the bishop of Winchester to court; and that prelate captivated the heart and admiration of this weak prince by sumptuous entertainments and magnifi∣cent presents. As he gained ground in his majesty's favour, he filled the court with his relations and adherents; and now that he was established in his good graces, resolved to employ all his address in augmenting his aversion to the justiciary. The prince of Wales having made some incursions into the English territories with impunity, the bishop, who had signalized his courage and mi∣litary capacity in the Holy Land, expostulated with the king upon the disgrace of sitting tamely, and seeing his dominions ravaged by a handful of naked sa∣vages. When Henry gave him to understand that his finances were scarce sufficient to defray the expences of his houshold, much less to maintain a war against his neighbours, Peter loudly inveighed against the conduct of the prime minister; affirming that his revenues were mismanaged and embezzled; that the wardships of the crown were bestowed upon individuals, without pro∣ducing any advantage to the exchequer; that the income of vacant benefices was intercepted, as well as that of lands reverting to the crown by death or confiscation; and that, by the help of honest officers and proper oeconomy, he might, like his predecessors, keep his coffers always full, and his sway inde∣pendent of the general assembly. This was a doctrine that sounded very agre∣ably in the ears of Henry, who was equally indigent, rapacious, and averse to national councils: he forthwith ordered all his sheriffs and officers of the reve∣nue to produce their accounts. Some of them being detected in frauds, were deprived of their offices, and imprisoned. Ralf Brito, treasurer of the cham∣ber, was fined in a thousand pounds, and his post bestowed upon Peter de Ri∣vaux, nephew to the bishop of Winchester. These were previous steps which that prelate took to pave the way for the execution of his grand project. Hav∣ing thus removed the dependents of Hubert, whose credit daily diminished, he at length prevailed upon the king to divest that minister of his office of justi∣ciary, and confer it upon Stephen de Seagrave, the bishop's creature and chief favourite, although Hubert had enjoyed it by a patent for life. Not contented with this triumph over his rival, he persuaded Henry to call him to account for the sums of money which had passed through his hands during his administra∣tion; and Hubert endeavoured to avoid this inquiry, by producing a patent of king John, containing an ample discharge for all the money he had received in the course of his faithful services to his sovereign. The bishop of Winchester, who was present, told him that such an acquittance could have no effect upon his administration since the accession of his present majesty: and added, that this was not the only crime laid to his charge; for he was accused of divers crimes and misdemeanours; and, in particular, of having given the king per∣nicious counsel, to the unspeakable prejudice of his affairs. Hubert perceiv∣ing that this prelate was bent upon his ruin, and that the king's heart was al∣together alienated, desired that he might be indulged with time to prepare for his defence; and this demand the bishop could not refuse, without running the risk of disobliging the barons, by excluding Hubert <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom a privilege he en∣joyed
<PB N="476" REF="4850"/>
in common with all the noblemen of the kingdom. The earl of Kent having intimation that Peter was determined upon bringing him to an igno∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s death, and finding it very difficult to unravel a number of perplexed accounts, retired to the priory of Merton, in Surry, where he took sanctuary; and the king, whose resentment against him was now as rancorous as his for∣mer confidence had been unbounded and implicit, ordered the mayor of Lon∣don to bring him from his retreat, either dead or alive. This order being re∣ceived in the evening, Roger Duke the mayor assembled the populace with the alarm ball; and having signified the king's command, directed them to pro∣vide arms, so as to march in the morning to execute the king's order. No∣thing could be more agreeable than such an office to the vulgar, who hated Hubert ever since the execution of their favourite leader Constantine; and they dispersed with joy to make preparations for the enterprize. Mean while several citizens of distinguished note and discretion, dreading the consequences of such a tumultuary meeting, repaired to the bishop of Winchester in South∣wark, and even waked him from his sleep, to represent the danger that might ensue to the church of Merton and the city itself, from the licentiousness of such a disorderly multitude. The prelate, instead of acting up to the duty of his function, by interposing his influence with the king, to procure a revoca∣tion of the order, told them, that whatever might be the consequence, they ought to obey his majesty's command. Thus encouraged, the populace, to the amount of twenty thousand armed men, marched out in the morning, with colours flying, towards the church of Merton, where Hubert sat on his knees before the altar, expecting his death with fortitude and resignation. What the bishop of Winchester ought to have procured without being sollicited, was obtained by the remonstrances of the earl of Chester, who, though a pro∣fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed enemy of Hubert, represented to the king, that such tumultuary pro∣ceedings might produce a very dangerous sedition, and furnish the world with a handle to reproach him with ingratitude to a nobleman whose whole life had been dedicated, in a remarkable manner, to the service of himself and his family. Henry, conscious of the truth and honesty of this observation, and perhaps moved with the magnanimity of the earl, who could so nobly sacra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice his resentment to justice and the interest of his country, sent a counter∣order to the mayor of London; and this, by the diligence of the bishop of Chichester, was dispatched in time enough to prevent mischief; so that the mul∣titude returned to London extremely chagrined at their disappointment. The archbishop of Dublin and the bishop of Chichester were the only persons of note who adhered to the earl of Kent in his adversity; and they seconded the re∣monstrances of the earl of Chester with such success, that they obtained let∣ters patent from the king, granting Hubert time to prepare for his trial before his peers. Trusting to the protection of this indulgence, he set out for St. Edmundsbury on a visit to his wife; and the king, being informed that he intended to escape, sent a detachment of three hundred men, to apprehend and bring him back prisoner to the Tower. Godfrey de Craucombe, who commanded this party, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound him in the chapel at Brentwood, with a cross in one hand, and the sacrament in the other: but, notwithstanding the sanc∣tity of his situation, he was dragged out by violence, and his feet being chained under a horse's belly, conveyed to prison like a common felon. Such indig∣nities
<PB N="477" REF="4860"/>
offered to a nobleman, who had signalized his courage and fidelity above all his cotemporaries, and sat so long at the helm of government, affected the very populace assembled on the occasion; even a blacksmith, whom Crau∣combe desired to fasten the fetters, refused the employment with disdain, and made an affecting speech on the occasion. Next morning Roger, bishop of London, went to court, to complain of this breach of the church's privileges, and threatened all concerned in the outrage with excommunication, unless Hubert should be immediately released. The king accordingly ordered him to be carried back to the chapel; but, at the same time, the sheriffs of Hert∣ford and Essex were directed to raise the posse, and surround the place in such a manner, as that he should neither escape nor receive sustenance: nay, such was the virulence of Henry's hatred, that he forbade all his courtiers to inter∣cede in his behalf; and the alternative he offered to Hubert was perpetual exile, perpetual imprisonment, or the confession of his treason. The earl, conscious of his own merit and innocence, refused to buy his life on such scan∣dalous conditions; and, after having remained a whole month in the chapel, half famished, he surrendered himself to the sheriff, who reconveyed him to the tower in shackles. The king being informed that he had deposited a consider∣able treasure in the hands of the Templars, demanded it of the master, who refused to deliver it without Hubert's order, which was immediately granted. Though this treasure furnished his enemies with a new pretence for expa∣tiating upon his fraud and extortion, it appeased the indignation of Henry, who now affected to remember his great services; and when he was urged to proceed against the earl with the utmost severity, declared that he would never consent to the death of a nobleman to whom he and his father had owed such important obligations. He now listened to terms of composition; and Hu∣bert, after having conveyed to Henry all his personal estate, and the lands he held of the crown, was allowed to enjoy the rest of his fortunes: in the mean time, the earls of Cornwal, Warrenne, Pembroke, and Lincoln, became sureties for his good behaviour; but he was ordered to remain in the castle of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>The bishop of Winchester, instead of taking warning from the dis∣grace<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1233.</NOTE> of Hubert de Burgh, seemed to think his own power established, by that event, beyond any possibility of being shaken, and erected an absolute autho∣rity upon the ruins of that minister. He persuaded the king, that very few of his nobility were well affected to his government; and that he should never render himself independent, while they possessed the great offices of the king∣dom: he therefore advised him to undermine their power gradually, by de∣priving them of their lucrative posts and governments, which he might bestow upon foreigners, who would always be devoted to his pleasure. Henry, who hated the barons, relished this advice, and, in a little time, above two thou∣sand knights arrived in England from Gascony and Poitiers, the native coun∣try of the bishop and his nephew Peter de Rivaux, who had invited them to share the spoils of the nation. These were provided with advantageous em∣ployments, taken from the English barons, who could not be supposed to part with them in good humour: they were even intrusted with the wardship of minors, by which they procured advantageous matches, to the prejudice of the
<PB N="478" REF="4870"/>
natives. These proceedings could not fail to produce clamours and discontent, among the nob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty Richard, earl of Pembroke, was the first who ventured to complain op<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly of this impolitic attachment to strangers. He told the king, that this partiality to foreigners alienated the affections of his people, and produced such discontent as would be attended with dangerous consequen∣ces; and frankly assured his majesty, that should he continue to lavish his fa∣vours upon strangers, in preference of his English subjects, the barons would be obliged to concert measures for delivering the kingdom from such rapacious interlopers. The bishop, who was present at this expostulation, immediately replied, that his insolence deserved chastisement, for pretending to deprive his lovereign of the liberty to employ those whom he judged most proper for his service; and that if the foreigners already in the kingdom were not sufficient to reduce his rebellious subjects, a greater number should be brought over for that purpose. Such an arrogant declaration could not but be extremely shocking to the noblemen of England: they forthwith retired from court, and began to form associations for their mutual defence; while the bishop of Winchester seemed to despise their resentment, confiding in his Poitevins, who now flocked over in great numbers. The earls and barons being summoned to an assembly or parliament at Oxford, to be held at Midsummer, they refused to expose them∣selves to the insults and treachery of perfidious foreigners. They received a se∣cond and third citation, with promise that their grievances should be redressed; but, understanding that fresh swarms of aliens arrived every day with military accoutrements, they, instead of appearing personally, sent a deputation to the king, desiring he would remove Peter, bishop of Winchester, and his Poite∣vins from his councils and kingdom; otherwise they should be obliged to expel him from the throne, and find out some more worthy prince to sway the scepter of England.</P>

<P>Henry himself was terrified at this message; but the bishop soon dispelled his apprehensions, by exaggerating his own military capacity, and the valour of his Poitevins, with whom he undertook to subdue those insolent traitors, who treated their prince with such indignity. It was resolved that they should immediately feel the weight of his resentment and arbitrary power. Gilbert Basset being dispossessed of a manour, and applying to Henry for justice, was insulted with the appellation of traitor, and ordered to quit the court on pain of being hanged; his brother-in-law Richard Siward was imprisoned, on pretence of having married without the king's licence; and all the suspected noblemen were commanded to give hostages for their peaceable behaviour. The earl mareschal receiving intimation from his sister, the countess of Cornwal, of a design against his life, retired to Wales; but the other confederates appeared in parliament, properly armed for their own se∣curity. No resolution was taken in this assembly, on account of the earl's ab∣sence; but, in a little time after it broke up, Winchester and Seagrave, per∣suaded the king to summon all who owed him military services, to meet him in arms at Gloucester, on the fourteenth day of August.

Lincoln, by means of a thousand marks artfully distributed: at the same time Baldwin, count de Guisnes, landed at Dover with a strong body of Flemings, who joined the king at Gloucester. By this time earl mareschal finding himself abandoned by three such powerful confederates, engaged in a league offensive and defensive with Llewellyn, and the Welsh noblemen who had been for some time on very precarious terms with England; and Henry, reinforced by his foreigners, advanced to Hereford, in order to besiege one of the earl's castles. The garrison defended it so courageously, that the besiegers began to be in want of provisions, before they had made any progress in the enterprize. The king saw no prospect of taking the place by force of arms; and, as it would be disgraceful to raise the siege, some prelates were sent to treat with the earl mareschal, who agreed to surrender the castle, on a solemn promise that it should be restored in a fortnight, and every grievance redressed at the meeting of the parliament, which was convoked for the beginning of October. Winchester and Seagrave swore to the performance of these articles; but, notwithstanding their oath, the castle was not restored, until it was be∣sieged, and retaken by the owner. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament assembling at Westminster, besought the king to be reconciled to his barons, and complained of his proscribing English noblemen as traitors, without trial or conviction. The bishop of Winchester not only pretended to justify the king's conduct, but was so imprudent as to affirm, that the English noblemen were not intiled to the privileges enjoyed by the peers of France. He had scarce pronounced this hardy asseveration, when all the bishops rose up, and threatened him with the sentènce of excommunica∣tion. He told them he was not subject to their jurisdiction, as having been consecrated by the pope, to whom he appealed from any step they might take to his prejudice; and though they did not censure him by name, they excom∣municated all those who alienated the king's affection from his subjects: but, when Henry pressed them to fulminate the same sentence againse the earl ma∣reschal, who had retaken his castle, they refused to comply with his request, observing that it would be highly unjust to censure a man for recovering his own property. The king therefore, finding himself under the necessity of at∣tacking him in the field, ordered all his troops to rendezvous at Gloucester, immediately after All-Saints, and from thence began his march into Wales; but the earl having taken the precaution to drive away the cattle, his army was, in a little time, so destitute of forage and provisions, that he was obliged to change his route and enter Monmouthshire, to prepare magazines for the subsistence of his forces. The earl, understanding that the king, and his principal officers were quartered in the castle of Grosmont, while the army lay encamped without the walls, attacked them in the night, routed them at the first onset, and took about six hundred horses, with all the king's baggage; so that he was fain to return to Gloucester. Then Pembroke undertook the siege of Monmouth, which was defended by Baldwin de Guisnes, a Flemish officer of great reputation, who laid an ambush for the earl, and actually took him prisoner, while he rode round, observing the place with a few attendants: but, luckily for the earl, Baldwin was mortally wounded with an arrow, as he con∣ducted his prisoner to the castle. His troops halting in consequence of this accident, Pembroke's forces came up, and not only delivered their gene∣ral,

<P>During these transactions, Hubert de Burgh, who still con∣tinued a prison<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in the castle of the Devizes, received an intimation, that the bishop o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Winchester was determiued to take away his life; and that he might execute this resol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion with the greater facility, was solliciting the king for the government of the castle.

Of this, however, the governor was no sooner informed, than he detached a party in pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit of the fugitive, whom they found at the foot of the altar in a country church, and carried back to the castle, after having buffetted and insulted him<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1234.</NOTE> with the utmost indignity. The bishop of Salisbury, being informed of this violation, demanded him of the governor; and, upon his refusal to surrender the prisoner, excommunicated the whole garrison. His complaints to the king were seconded by the bishop of London, who represented this affront offered to the church, as a matter of such consequence to Henry, that he ordered Hu∣bert to be reconveyed to the place from whence he had been taken, which was, at the same time, surrounded by the sheriff and his posse comitatus: so that the prisoner would have reaped no benefit from his removal, had not he been rescued by Richard Siward and some armed friends, with whom he retired to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>This nobleman made great progress after the king's retreat. He defeated a body of troops commanded by John of Monmouth, ravaged the lands belonging to the king's counsellors, in the frontiers of Wales, and re∣duced the town of Shrewsbury to ashes; while Henry, instead of opposing his career, retired to Winchester, leaving the counties, on the Severne side, to his mercy. He was advised by the bishop to make an accommodation with the earl; but this advice he rejected, at the instigation of Winchester, unless that nobleman would throw himself at his feet, and own himself a traitor. Indeed this prelate had a resource, of which those counsellors were ignorant; he wrote letters, in the king's name, to Maurice Fitzgerald, justiciary of Ireland, Walter and Hugh de Lacy, Richard de Burgh, Geoffrey de Mareis, and others, giv∣ing them to understand, that Richard, earl mareschal, had been deprived, in the king's court, of all his honours and estate; and desiring they would ravage his lands in Ireland, so as to provoke him to go thither: in which case, if they would take him dead or alive, all his Irish fortune should be divided among them. Before they would engage in this undertaking, they demanded a pa∣tent to confirm the partition; and this being sealed and sent over, they began to waste the lands belonging to Richard. He no sooner heard of this unpro∣voked injury, than he crossed the sea with fifteen attendants, and, at his land∣ing, was received by Geoffrey de Mareis, one of his own vassals, with all the exterior marks of fidelity and attachment. This traitor engaged to raise troops for his service, against those who had invaded his estate, and inve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gled him into a parley with his colleagues; on which occasion, being deserted by all his followers, he received a mortal stab in the back with a poignard, of which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<P>While the bishop of Winchester and his adherents employed their influence to such infamous purposes, the prelates, in order to avert the mischievous consequences that must have attended the male practices of this wicked ministry, resolved to exert themselves in behalf of their country. In a parliament at Westminster, Henry taxed several bishops, and Alexander of Litchfield in particular, with being engaged, in concert with the earl mareschal, and the rebellious barons. The bishop, in order to demonstrate the falsity of the charge, rose up, and, in a solemn manner, excommunicated all those who were concerned in such treasonable practices, as well as the calumniators of the bishops. Edmund, elect of Canterbury, not satisfied with that censure, re∣paired with his suffragans to court, and explained to Henry the ruinous mea∣sures to which he had been instigated by his ministers: he accused Peter, bi∣shop of Winchester, as the author of those pernicious counsels, which had dif∣fused a spirit of discontent through the whole nation; he represented the danger of entrusting mercenary foreigners with the custody of his own sister as well as Eleanor of Brittany, together with his treasury and the chief fortresses of the kingdom; and finally insisted upon his removing those evil counsellors, on pain of being excommunicated, with all his adherents. The king, startled at this remonstrance, desired time to deliberate, and his eyes seemed to be opened all at once, to the danger that threatened him from his misconduct and partiality: nevertheless, he formed no resolution during this session of parliament. Before the next meeting Edmund was consecrated; so that he renewed his address with greater authority, and the king granted him all the satisfaction he could desire; the bishop of Winchester was sent to his diocese; Peter de Rivaux was dis∣missed from his post of high treasurer, and ordered to give up his accounts, together with the castles in his custody; Seagrave was divested of his post of justiciary; the foreigners were obliged to quit the country, and the English prelates and noblemen readmitted into the privy council.</P>

<P>Measures immediately took a new turn; three bishops were sent as ambassadors, to conclude a peace with Llewellyn and the earl ma∣reschal; and the king himself set out for Gloucester, that he might be at hand to forward the negotiation. In his way to that city, he was informed of Pem∣broke's death, and could not help shedding tears, when he understood how that worthy nobleman had been betrayed. Llewellyn consented to the proposals of peace, on condition that the barons of his alliance should be pardoned and re∣stored; and they repaired to court, where they met with a very favourable re∣ception from his majesty, who, among the rest, distinguished Hubert de Burgh, with particular marks of tenderness and favour. The outlawries against that nobleman and the other consederates, were, by proclamation, declared null and void: he recovered his honours, and his former favour with the king; Basset and Siward were created privy counsellors; Gilbert, bro∣ther to the earl of Pembroke, received the investiture of the English and Irish estates; and Henry, having first knighted him, delivered in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his hands the mareschal's staff, at a parliament held in Worcester. It was at this assembly that Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, produced copies of the letters and forgeries which had been contrived, written, and sealed, for the destruction of the earl of Pembroke; and the whole audience was fill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with horror and in∣dignation, when they heard them recited. The perfidious authors were sum∣moned
<PB N="482" REF="4910"/>
to appear in court at Midsummer, and answer to this and other charges of male administration: but, instead of obeying the citation, Winchester and Rivaux took sanctuary in the cathedral of Winton; Seagrave retired to the church of St. Mary Newark in Leicester; and Passelewe, one of their accom∣plices, concealed himself in a cellar in London. Edmund, being averse to all violent measures, persuaded the king to grant them a safe conduct; in conse∣quence of which they came forth from the places of their retreat, and were brought before the king for their examination. Peter de Rivaux appeared in the habit of a clergyman, under which a coat of mail and a stiletto were con∣cealed; he fell upon his knees and sued for mercy, and desired time to regu∣late his accompts of wardships, escheats, and other branches of the crown re∣venue. His request was granted, though his lay possessions were sequestred, and his person was delivered to the archbishop, who sent him to the cathedral of Winchester. Seagrave, besides the other articles of his charge, was accused by Henry, of having advised him to put Hubert de Burgh to death, and banish the nobility. He and Passelewe, treasurer of the exchequer, endeavoured to palliate their offences, by alledging they only conformed to the direction of their superiors, to whom they were subservient. They were fined a thousand marks each; and Seagrave was obliged to restore several manours which had been alienated from the crown in his favour.

<P>While the king of England was thus employed in regulating his domestic officers, the truce with France expired; and, as the overtures made for a renewal of the suspension did not succeed, Lewis invaded the count of Brittany, who earnestly sollicited succours from England: but Henry, far from supporting this ally with that vigour which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound policy required, sent<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

During this interval, he exerted all his industry and eloquence, to engage Henry in an expedition for his relief; but all his endeavours proving ineffectual, he did homage to Lewis for his dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

Henry, by advice of his council, granted to the parochial clergy the tythes of hay and mills, in all demesnes of the crown throughout England; he paid the tribute regularly to the pope; and, by the mediation of his holiness, another truce for five years was concluded with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

of eight hundred livres, in lieu of the isle of Oleron, to which he laid claim. It was also by the negotiation of pope Gregory, that the king of Eng∣land acquired a powerful ally in the person of the emperor Frederic II. who demanded Henry's sister Isabel in marriage. The proposal was embraced; the articles of the contract immediately settled; the nobility granted a scutage, by which thirty thousand marks were levied as her fortune; she was sent with a numerous retinue into Germany, and there received with the utmost mag∣nificence; and the nuptials were celebrated at Worms with incredible pomp, in presence of four kings, eleven dukes, thirty marquisses and earls, besides a vast number of prelates and gentlemen. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>Henry, having thus disposed of his sister, began to think in good earnest upon a match for himself. We have already taken notice of four different negotiations on this subject, which miscarried through his own levity; but, now having arrived at the years of discretion, and perceiving the expedi∣ency of settling the succession, in order to preserve the peace of the kingdom, he resolved to marry Eleanor, the second daughter of Raymund Berenger, count of Provence, who had already disposed of his eldest daughter to the king of France. The prelates and nobility approving of this alliance, Henry sent ambassadors with formal proposals, which were very acceptable to the fa∣ther.

<P>In the assembly, convoked for this coronation, several regula∣tions were made, and, among the rest, the famous statute of Merton, relating to the dowers and wills of widows, the improvement of waste, the exemption of heirs from usury, during their minority, for debts contracted by their fa∣thers, the limitation of writs, and other articles calculated for the ease and se∣curity of the people. Upon this occasion too, the bishops proposed to esta∣blish a constitution of the canon law, by which all children born before the marriage of their parents should be deemed legitimate by that subsequent union: but, as such an alteration would affect the succession of titles and estates, and introduce confusion into families, the lay nobility declared they would never alter the laws of England. The same fortitude and resolution they manifested in persuading the king to refuse the request of the emperor, who sent an em∣bassy to desire that Richard, earl of Cornwal, might be sent over to the impe∣rial court, where he should be supplied with troops to attack France, already embroiled by the king of Navarre, and recover the territories that were wrested from his father. The nobility interposed with great warmth, and even protested against exposing the presumptive heir of the crown to the dangers of war in a foreign country; and the emperor's proposal was accordingly rejected.</P>

<P>The weakness of Henry soon reappeared, notwithstanding all the pains which the new ministry took to regulate his conduct. William de Savorie, bishop elect of Valence, and uncle to queen Eleanor, whom he had conducted into England, infinuated himself so artfully into the king's confi∣dence and affection, that he resigned himself intirely to the guidance of this fo∣reigner, and managed the helm of government by his sole direction. The Eng∣lish were always impatient of foreign councils; and as the nation still smarted

from the pernicious measures of Winchester and his Poitevins, the nobility re∣solved to crush this new influence before it should increase so as to affect the welfare o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the nation. When the next parliament was convened at London, this was the first object of their consideration; and they presented a remonstrance to the king, who was so terrified at the address that he retired to the Tower, where he proposed to finish the business of the sess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n; but the members re∣tusing to assemble in a place commanded by the very strangers against whom their address was levelled, he returned to his palace; and affairs were carried on in the usual channel.

Alexander, king of Scotland, chose this conjuncture to send an embassy to Henry with a demand of the three northern counties, agree∣able to a convention made with his father, and a declaration of war, in case of a refusal. The council, finding both parts of the alternative equally dis∣agreeable, amused him with a promise of examining his pretensions; and a con∣ference was afterwards opened on this subject at York, where, by the media∣tion of Otho, the pope's legate, a final peace was concluded; and Alexander renounced his claim, in consideration of two hundred pounds a year, payable by the northern counties, for which he swore fealty and did homage to the king<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of England: and as for Llewellyn, who was by this time old, infirm, and pa∣ralytic, he agreed to a truce, which ended in a pacification.</P>

<P>The foreigners who had insinuated themselves into the king's favour, perceiving how odious they were to the English nobility, and the nation in general, resolved to strengthen their party against the storm that was brewing. They prevailed upon Henry to dismiss Ralph Fitz-Nicholas, the lord steward, and other officers, from the household and council, and to de∣mand the seals from the bishop of Chichester, who had behaved as chancellor with remarkable integrity; but this prelate refused to resign his office, except by order of the council from which he had received his authority. Rivaux, Seagrave, and Passelewe, were recalled to court, where they were reconciled to Henry and recovered their influence. The measures for which they had been disgraced were now revived; the castle of Gloucester and Eleanor of Brit∣tany was recommitted to their charge; and in a word, they engrossed all the benefactions which Henry had in his power to bestow. One would be apt to think those insolent strangers had been hired by some rival prince to bring Henry's character into contempt and detestation with his own subjects. They exhorted him to revoke all the alienations of the crown demesnes and grants made to the nobility before his marriage; they engaged the pope in this pro∣ject. That pontiff published a bull, representing those grants as injurious to the honour of the crown, detrimental to his right of sovereignty, absolving Henry from the oath by which they had been confirmed, and directing an im∣mediate resumption. This mandate was signified to the parliament assembled at Winchester; but the members rejected the proposal with disdain, observing that a compliance with the bull would be an acknowlegement of subjection to the Roman see, of which they considered the kingdom intirely independent.</P>

other resource, another parliament was convoked at Westminster, where the king giving them to understand that his finances were quite exhausted, by the expences attending his own marriage and the queen's coronation, desired they would grant him a subsidy for the necessary purposes of his government. To this proposal they answered, that the aids which they had so often granted, were never employed for the glory or advantage of the nation; that on the con∣trary he had suffered the extent of his dominions to be curtailed by his enemies, and squandered away the sums of money, which ought to have been employed for the defence of his territories, among worthless foreigners who supplanted his subjects in his favour, and assisted him in oppressing the people. Henry faithfully promised to be ruled for the future by the counsels of his natural subjects; and that if they would now indulge him with the thirtieth part of their moveables, he would never ask another supply that they should see any reason to refuse. In order to facilitate their compliance, he disavowed the pope's bull touching the resumption of grants; declared he would inviolably observe the liberties of the Magna Charta; and ordered a sentence of excommunication to be pronounced against all persons (himself not excluded) who should presume to violate that sacred constitution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The constituent members of that parliament were the prelates, the magistrates, or great ba∣rons, summoned by special writs, and the ordi∣nary barons or nobles, summoned in general by the sheriff's proclamation; these last compre∣hended all the gentry that held by military tenure, whether knights or esquires; and accordingly, Matthew Paris says there was at this parliament an infinite multitude: so that they did not choose representatives, but every individual appeared or might have appeared in his own person, as a member of parliament. The borroughs and com∣mons had as yet no representatives, as appears from the writs issued out far levying this subsidy; in one of which it is expressly said, that the pre∣lates, earls, and barons, assembled on the eve of St. Hilary, had granted the king a thirtieth of all their moveables; and the other declares that the prelates, earls, barons, and freeholders, had granted a thirtieth for themselves and their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣lanes: i. e. then copyholders and tenants.

<P>In spite of these precautions, Henry lavished away the money upon his foreign favourites and his wife's relations. Tho' he had solemnly engaged to follow the advice of English counsellors, he was still directed in all his measures by W. de Valence, on whom he conferred the honour of Rich∣mond, which had formerly been granted to his own brother, the earl of Corn∣wal. The avarice and ambition of this favourite grasped at every post of ho∣nour and advantage, and gave such umbrage to the English nobility, that a civil commotion would probably have ensued, had not he thought proper to withdraw on pretence of visiting his own country, where however, he stayed no longer than he heard the resentment of the English barons had subsided: then he returned to the kingdom, where he renewed his arbitrary practices. Never∣theless,
<PB N="486" REF="4950"/>
he was not so free of apprehension, but that he prevailed upon Henry to desire the pope would send over a legate, whose authority co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>operating with the power of the crown, might overawe the malecontents and ensure the obe∣dience of the common people. Otho was invested with this character, and his commission extended into Scotland; and though his arrival produced an uni∣versal clamour, he conducted himself with such prudence and moderation as acquired the esteem and veneration of the public. Alexander, king of Scot∣land, forbade him to cross the borders; and indeed he felt no inclination to visit that country, after he had been made acquainted with the ferocity of the natives. He summoned a council at St. Paul's in London, where several canons were enacted, touching the discipline of the church; forbidding the practice of farming churches and ecclesiastical dignities, non-residence, and the marriage of the clergy; but he did not exert any unpopular acts of autho∣rity; and employed his good offices in effecting a reconciliation between the bishop of Winchester and Hubert earl of Kent, who had long been at vari∣ance. Yet the presence of this legate animated Henry to proceed in bestow∣ing all his favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and confidence on a foreign ministry, and to disregard the remonstrance of the English nobility, among whom his own brother Richard endeavoured without effect to persuade him to a change of measures.</P>

<P>Though he rejected this advice, his favourites found it necessary to gain over some leaders of the opposition, and to engage in their interest John, earl of Lincoln, high-constable of England, and Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, youngest son of the famous general who commanded the crusade against the Albigenses. He inherited the honour of Hinckley, the stewardship of England, and the county of Leicester, by the resignation of his brother Amaury, in right of his mother, who was daughter and coheiress to Robert Fitz-Parnal, earl of Leicester. This young nobleman had ingratiated himself with Henry to such a degree, that his ambition surmounted all bounds; and thinking himself too great for a subject, he aspired to the dignity of so∣vereign. With this view he had payed his addresses successively to the hei∣resses of Boulogne and Flanders; but miscarrying in both negotiations, he turned his eyes upon Eleanor, the second sister of Henry and widow of William de<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1238.</NOTE> Mareschal, earl of Pembroke. Though she had, at the decease of that noble∣man, made a vow of perpetual chastity, and taken the ring without the veil from Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, the foreign ministers resolving to attach Simon to their interest at any rate, persuaded the king to consent to the marriage; and he actually gave her away with his own hand, in the private chapel of his palace, where the ceremony was performed by one of his chap∣lains. The king was severely rebuked for this clandestine match, by the arch∣bishop; and the barons of the opposition were so much incensed at the de∣fection of Montfort and the earl of Lincoln, who was likewise bribed by a marriage between his daughter and Richard de Clare, that they began to con∣cert measures for doing themselves justice. The earls of Cornwal and Mares∣chal, with almost all the nobility of England, engaged in a corfederacy against the foreign ministry and the two deserters of their country's cause; and the nation in general favoured their undertaking. They assembled in arms at Southwark; and being joined by the citizens of London, loud∣ly demanded that Lincoln and Montfort, together with the foreign mi∣nisters,
<PB N="487" REF="4960"/>
should be dismissed from the council-board. Henry, terrified at these proceedings, had recourse to the good offices of the legate, who by the promise of large grants appeased the resentment of Richard, earl of Cornwal; and a truce was concluded till the first Monday of Lent, when all grievances were to be redressed at a general council in London. There the barons appeared, at the time appointed: but by this time the earl of Cornwal being bought off, the grievances were but half redressed; and the dispute was compromised by Otho's mediation. The two earls were dismissed from the council; and Simon afraid that his marriage would be dissolved, by the representations of Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, went privately to Rome, where by dint of money he obtained the pope's confirmation. Then he returned in triumph to England, where he was received with extraordinary marks of favour and affection by Henry, who solemnly invested him with the earldom of Leicester.</P>

<P>The pope's legate, after the accommodation which he effected be∣tween the king and the barons, set out on a visitation towards the north; and taking Oxford in his way, was sumptuously entertained by the university in the abbey of Osiney. After dinner the scholars, coming to pay their respects to his reverence, were refused admittance by his Italian porter, and insulted in such a manner that they endeavoured to force their entrance. The legate's servants ran to sustain the porter, and an obstinate fray ensued. A poor Irish scholar, begging at the kitchen grate, was miserably scalded by the steward, who was the legate's own brother; and a Welshman seeing this outrage, was so incensed that he shot him dead with an arrow. The legate, terrified at this disturbance, fled to the church, from whence he escaped to Abingdon, where the king resided, and complained loudly of the unworthy treatment he had received. Henry forthwith sent the earl of Warenne with a party of soldiers to apprehend the rioters; and thirty being taken were committed prisoners to the castle of Wallingford. Otho, not yet satisfied, laid the university under an interdict, and excommunicated all those who had been concerned in the riot; but at the intercession of the bishops those censures were removed, and the scholars attoned for their presumption by walking barefoot in procession from St. Paul's to the legate's lodgings</P>

<P>In the course of this year Peter de Roches, bishop of Winchester, dying, Henry recommended William de Valence as his successor; but the monks excepted to him as a foreigner odious to the English; and a man who from his want of learning, passionate temper, and scandalous morals, was altogether unfit for such a sacred function. Yet, in order to manifest their inclination to act agreably to the king's desire, they pitched upon William de Ralegh and Ralf de Neville, bishop of Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hester, prelates of unblemished characters, and supposed acceptable to his majesty. Henry was so incensed at their presuming to dispute his recommendation, that he turned Ralegh out of his seat in coun∣cil, deprived Neville of the seals, prevailed upon the pope to annul both elec∣tions, and appoint a new prior to the convent, who at last procured a majority in favour of William de Valence. This martial prelate had gone abroad with Henry de Turbeville, to make a campaign in the emperor's army; but, at<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Brady.

<P>Henry payed so little regard to the representations of his people, that his administration was detested and his person despised; and some indivi∣duals, whose affairs were rendered desperate by his tyranny and oppression, concluded that the death of such a worthless prince would be looked upon as a blessing to the kingdom. On this supposition they concerted a plan for de∣priving <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im of lite, and chose for their instrument one Ribald, a person of family and learning. This man went to Wodestock, while Henry resided at that place, and affecting the behaviour of a lunatic, desired the king to resign the crown, which he had usurped from him to whom it of right belonged. When the officers in waiting would have forced him out of the presence, and punished him for his insolence, Henry forbade them to use any violence to the poor wretch, who seemed to have lost his senses; and this compassion furnished him with me opportunity of gliding unseen into the king's bedchamber, where he lay concealed with a design to murther his majesty. Luckily for Henry, he that night chanced to sleep with the queen; and the assassin, disappoint∣ed of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s prey, ran about the apartments with a long knife in his hand, roaring<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The guards, being alarmed at his outcries, took him into custody, where he confessed he was instigated to assassinate the king by William de Marels; and that several persons were embarked in the same conspiracy. He was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and the sentence was executed accordingly, though very little regard seems to have been payed to his information; for none of the accomplices that he named were apprehended, and no steps taken to discover the particulars of their com∣bination. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Such omission might indeed have been the effect of Henry's own caprice, which often prompted him to actions equally malicious and ab∣surd. This very period produced several instances of this nature, which serve to characterise the genius of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivolous monarch. As he had no fixed principles of action, he sometimes heaped favours upon those whom he had lately disgraced, and frequently insulted others immediately after he had loaded them with caresses. We have already observed, that on the death of Richard, earl of Pembroke, he had bestowed the investiture of earl mareschal on that nobleman's brother Gilbert, whose attachment and fidelity justified this indul∣gence. One day, however, when he repaired to court, according to custom, he was denied admittance, and even repulsed with indignity. Not a little surprized at this reception, he complained of the affront to the king, by the interposition of a friend: to whom Henry observed, that the earl's brother had been a traitor, and even persisted in his treason to his last moment; for which reason he blamed himself for having bestowed the office of great mareschal upon Gilbert; but, as he had given, so he would take away: a declaration which was no sooner communicated to the earl, than he retired to the north, in order to shelter himself from the designs of his enemies, who, he supposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1239.</NOTE> had prepossessed the king with notions to his prejudice. A few days after he had bestowed the earldom of Lei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ester upon Simon Montfort, he reviled him in the most abusive terms, branding him publicly as a traitor and
<PB N="489" REF="4980"/>
excommunicated wretch, who had debauched his wife before marriage, and afterwards procured, by bribes, the pope's confirmation. This insult, offered in presence of the countess, who was his own sister, alarmed her and her husband to such a degree that they immediately retired, and taking shipping in the Thames, were conveyed to the continent, where they remained until Henry's unaccountable anger was appeased. Nor did Hubert de Burgh escape another persecution, from the king's levity or malevolence; tho' that nobleman, far from having given any cause of offence since his reconciliation, had almost solely adhered to Henry in the last defection of the barons. A new pro∣cess was instituted against him for the crimes of which he had been formerly accused; and, in a solemn hearing before his peers, he manifested his inno∣cence by the most incontestable evidence; nevertheless, he thought proper to sacrifice four of his best castles to the rancour of the king, who, thus pacified, dropped the prosecution. Henry had almost embroiled himself with the pope, by sending Ralph de Tuberville with a small reinforcement to the emperor, who was then at war with that pontiff; and now, from a similar caprice of disposition, understanding that Frederic was solemnly excommunicated by the pope, he, with uncommon eagerness, ordered the sentence to be published in all the churches throughout the kingdom, tho' Frederic was his own brother∣in-law, and that alliance would have been a sufficient excuse for declining this publication; at least he might have postponed it so as to have expressed some reluctance in complying with Gregory's mandate. Such inconsistency in his conduct was sometimes the effect of his own whimsical gusts of passion; tho' frequently suggested by the individuals of a motley ministry, among whom he was continually agitated from error to indiscretion. These unjust and frantic proceedings had well nigh kindled another flame of civil disturbance, when the indignation of the people was luckily suspended by the birth of his son and heir, who was baptized by the legate, and named Edward, after the con∣fessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>By this time Otho had entirely altered his original conduct, and oppressed the churches and clergy with such insatiable avarice, that the bishops complained to the pope of his exactions; and that pontiff had twice sent letters of revocation to the cardinal, which were as often set aside, at the desire of the king, who considered him as the chief support of his administration. At length the prelates, harrassed and exhausted by the continual extortions of that legate, assembled in order to concert measures for redressing this grievance; and they had scarce begun to deliberate, when Otho entering the convocation, demanded a new subsidy to relieve the pressing necessities of the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee. The bishops were so much irritated by this new proposition, that they told him they were resolved to suffer his tyranny no longer, and broke up instantly, without giving him time to reply: thus repulsed, he had recourse to the con∣vents and religious houses, which were obliged to furnish what the bishops had refused. After having fleeced the kingdom of large sums, he resolved to fol∣low the same practice in Scotland; and, notwithstanding the caution he had received against entering that country, he directed his course northwards, ac∣companied by some English noblemen, who still respected his character. When he arrived at the border, he found Alexander waiting, not with a

Otho, enraged at this opposition, threat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned him with the censure of the church; and the Scot set him and his censures at defiance: so that an open rupture must have ensued, had not the English noblemen interposed their good offices, and prevailed upon Alexander to permit the legate to enter his dominions for that time only: yet this favour they could not obtain, until Otho agr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to acknowledge, under his hand and seal, that he considered i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a compliment to his own person, and that it should not be drawn into a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The difference being thus compromised, he accompanied the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Edinburgh, and found means to extort some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>butions from the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> clergy, in spite of all the precautions that could be taken to prevent this ex∣ercise of his legatine authority.</P>

<P>While the pope's representatives squeezed money from the ecclesiastics of England, the laity were plundered by the king's exactions. The pope, and his vassal Henry, seemed to vye with each other in pillaging the people; and nothing could have induced the English to suffer such oppression under a king of Henry's contemptible character, but the dread of papal resentment, and the remembrance of those miseries in which civil war had so lately involved the kingdom. The bishops held another convocation at London, where they pre∣sented a remonstrance to the king, complaining that he converted the vacant bishoprics to his own use, and retarded the elections by raising unjust obstacles, until his own choice was approved by the chapters; nay, they even proceeded so far as to excommunicate those who gave him such pernicious counsel: but he placed such confidence in the protection of the pope, that very little regard was paid to their representatives: he was even so base and degenerate as to glory in his dependence on the Roman see; and when the emperor sent an embassy to expostulate with him about his having published the sentence of excommunica∣tion, he replied that he was vassal to the pope, whose injunctions he durst not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1240.</NOTE> disobey. Mean while the legate, on his return from Scotland, renewed his ar∣bitrary exactions, levying considerable sums from churches and monasteries, un∣der the title of Procurations; and at length published a mandate, importing that he had a power not only to absolve from their vow, such as had taken the cross intending to visit the Holy Land, but also of compelling them to re∣deem themselves with money, on pain of excommunication. These extortions were countenanced and seconded by the pope's own immediate directions. He granted to the abbot and monks of Clugny, a tenth of the profits arising from all benefices in England, for the term of three years. But even Henry was ashamed of this imposition, and forbade the agents to collect it, on pain of incurring severe penalties. His holiness, far from being repulsed by this prohibition, attempted to raise a fifth of all ecclesiastical revenues, as an aid against the emperor, and accordingly exacted it from the Roman clergy settled in England, who durst not refuse it to a power on which they altogether de∣pended: it was afterwards proposed to the prelates, in a council at Reading, and granted by the advice and example of Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury. But, immediately after this transaction, Gregory bargained with the people of Rome for their assistance against the emperor, on condition of his providing their children and relations with English benefices; and he sent orders to Edmund, and the bishops of London and Sarum, to reserve for the Roman clergy three
<PB N="491" REF="5000"/>
hundred of the first livings that should fall vacant in England, on pain of being suspended from the power of collating. Edmund was extremely chagrined at this flagrant instance of insolent imposition, of which he bitterly complained to Henry, from whom receiving no redress, he grew weary of his life, and re∣tired<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>Gregory not yet satisfied, contrived another method for spunging the English clergy, which was no other than a fraudulent imposture. He employed Peter Rubens to collect money from one monastery to another, pretending that certain bishops and abbots, of whom he had produced a forged list , had already contributed a part, and others were drawn in by their example. He said the collection was intended for a particular purpose, which would be divulged in six months; and in the mean time he obliged the contributors to swear secrecy, until the scheme was fully executed. The abbots were no sooner apprized of the deceit, than they complained to Henry, from whom they received no sort of satisfaction, but that of seeing the prelates burdened with the like imposition. These the legate convened, in two successive synods, without being able to carry his point, until he tampered with them singly, and by cajoling caresses secured a majority in favour of the proposition; then he convoked a synod at London, where he again proposed the contribution, which being warmly re∣commended by the king, met with the approbation of the whole assembly, and was levied all over England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, notwithstanding the truce concluded between the pope and the emperor. Such a contribution was likewise raised in France; but Lewis being informed of the suspension of hostilities, and the negotiation for peace, would not allow it to be exported from his kingdom, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t such a supply should render the pope more inflexible and extravagant in his demands. Otho being recalled to assist at the conferences, departed from England about Christmas, and is said to have carried off more money than was left in the kingdom; tho' neither that nor the French col∣lection redounded to the advantage of his holiness; for the two legates were intercepted at sea by the Pisans, who acting as allies of the emperor, seized the treasure and imprisoned the cardinals. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Angl.

<P>Papal exactions did not cease at Otho's departure. He left an industri∣ous successor in the person of Peter de Rubens, who not only gleaned the remains of the contribution, which had not yet been levied, but endeavoured to ob∣tain the gift of two prebends and corrodies from the cathedrals and convents, which the pope had formerly solicited without success. He made his first at∣tack upon the abbey of Peterborough, the example of which, he supposed, the rest of the churches would follow. He tried to flatter and intimidate the monks alternately, into compliance; but they evaded his request, on pretence of the absence of their abbot Walter de S. Edmund, who had been summoned to the Roman council: and this prelate was no sooner informed of the legate's design, than he represented to Henry the mischievous consequences of such a concession, in the strongest colours; so that the king, as patron, strictly in∣hibited the convent from complying with the proposal. Tho' the pope's agents were baffled in this attempt, they succeeded in levying a twentieth on the clergy of Ireland, which amounted to a considerable sum. With this, and what they collected in England, before Henry put a stop to the contribution, they crossed the sea with great secrecy and dispatch, in apprehension of the money's

As Henry's affections were always biassed to foreigners, he on this occasion espoused their party with uncommon warmth; and that they might win the honours of the day, persuaded a number of his nobility to espouse their cause against Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, who engaged to enter the lists against Peter de Sa∣voye. This ridiculous partiality incensed the English to such a degree as had almost produced a civil war; and both sides were actually drawn up in order of battle, when Henry, convinced of his indiscretion, sent a positive order to for∣bid the tournament. He could not, however, prevent another which was afterwards held at Ware near Hertford, where Gilbert earl mareschal lost his life by an unruly horse, Robert de Say was slain, and a good number of people dangerously wounded. Henry exhibited convincing proofs of his affection to his queen's uncles, by granting the honour of Richmond to Peter, together with the custody of the lands belonging to John earl of Warenne in Suffex and Surrey; and he raised his brother Boniface to the archbishopric of Canterbury. Edmund had before his death excommunicated the monks of Christ-church, who thwarted him in the choice of a prior; and they had applied to the pope for absolution from this sentence, before they would proceed to a new election. Gregory had impowered the archdeacon of St. Albans, and the prior of Dun∣staple, to take off the censure; but Simon de Langton, archdeacon of Canter∣bury, appealing against that commission as surreptitiously obtained, the monks sollicited Henry for his protection; in consideration of which they promised to elect Boniface. The king embraced the proposal, and used such arguments with Langton as induced him to withdraw his appeal: so that Boniface was<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple.</NOTE> chosen without opposition; tho' he could not be immediately confirmed, on account of the vacancy in the papal chair.</P>

<P>The king found another subject of triumph in the death of Eleanor of Brittany, the hereditary heiress of the English crown, who had passed her days in continual confinement, and now died a virgin in the castle of Bristol. The apprehension of her title had been a continual thorn in the sides of king John and his son Henry, who on her account distrusted the English, and had, in the course of the preceding year, obliged all persons in England, above the age of twelve years, to take an eventual oath of allegiance in favour of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. Paris.</NOTE> his infant son Edward, whom he seemed to love with the warmer affection on account of his being named after the confessor. In veneration to the memory of that prince, he rebuilt the church of Westminster, at a very great expence; he kept all his festivals with the utmost solemnity; and caused a golden shrine of exquisite workmanship to be made for his relics. The king's extravagance and want of oeconomy were such as kept him always indigent and rapacious; and the chief business of his life was to contrive and execute schemes for squeez∣ing money from his people. One talliage succeeded another so fast, that the
<PB N="493" REF="5020"/>
subjects had no respite; and the Jews were fleeced without mercy, to gratify the insatiable avarice of his foreign favourites. These were continually em∣ployed in finding plausible pretexts for raising money, and their invention ge∣nerally succeeded.</P>

<P>Llewellyn, prince of Wales, dying in a very advanced age, left his principality to his son David, who had made some petty incursions into the English territories, and seemed averse to an accommodation with Henry. He had an illegitimate brother, older than himself, named Griffin, who was ex∣tremely popular among the Welsh; and therefore the object of his jealousy and hatred. He had claimed part of his father's inheritance, to which he was in∣titled by the law of the country; but David, instead of complying with his demand, committed him to close prison. His wife had recourse to Henry, whose assistance she sollicited, with promise of paying to him a certain yearly sum out of her husband's estate. The king, allured by this bait, interposed his good offices with David; but these proving ineffectual, he assembled an army, with which he entered Wales about Midsummer, when the marshes were dry and accessible, and in a few weeks compelled him not only to release his brother, but also to submit to such terms of peace as he thought proper to propose. At the same time, dreading some commotion from the popularity of Griffin, should he allow him to enjoy his liberty, he committed him close prisoner to the Tower of London, where he continued above two years; till at length at∣tempting to make his escape, the rope gave way, where falling down headlong, he dashed his brains out on the ground, and immediately expired. Thus Henry's protection was converted into oppression, by the artifice of David, who gratified him with greater advantages than he had stipulated with the un∣fortunate Griffin.</P>

<P>While he prospered in this manner among the mountains of Wales, his brother Richard acquired great reputation for his courage, conduct, and li∣berality, in Palestine, where he fortified Ascalon, recovered Jerusalem, and made an advantageous truce for ten years with the Saracens. After these tran∣sactions he set out on his return to England, and tarried two months at the im∣perial court, with his sister the empress, who died in childbed immediately after his departure. He had scarce arrived in his own country, when he was sollicited by the Poitevins to undertake an expedition into Poitou, and assert his right to that province. Before his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he had been solemnly invested with the county so called, tho' France possessed a good part of it by the conquests of Philip Augustus; and the province being thus divided between the two crowns, Lewis thought he had as good a right to bestow the investiture upon his own brother Alphonso. Henry resolved to revenge this insult; and engaged in the quarrel with the more eagerness, as it affected the interest of his mother, who had by this time espoused the count de la Marche, her former lover. As her husband's territories were in that part of Poitou which was pos∣sessed by France, he had done homage for them to Lewis: but, when Al∣phonso received the investiture, her pride would not suffer the count to kneel before the French king's brother. Thus animated, he refused to take the usual oath; and that he might be prepared against the resentment of Lewis, demanded the assistance of the English monarch. He represented to Henry the facility with which the French might be expelled from Poitou, and assured
<PB N="494" REF="5030"/>
him that the province itself would supply a sufficient number of men for that p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpose, provided Henry would defray the expence of their subsistence. The king f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attered with this hope, convoked a parliament, and demanded a subsidy<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch 1242.</NOTE> proportioned to the importance of the expedition. But, instead of complying with his request, they reproached him with the dissipation of his revenue, and with the illegal impositions he had so often laid upon the people; they loudly complained of his breach of promise with regard to the charters of liberties, which he had so often sworn to maintain; and observing that the truce with France was not yet expired, plainly told him he had nothing further to ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Carte.</NOTE> from their compliance. Nevertheless, he practised the method of cajoling the members in private, which had already succeeded on two or three different occasions; and prevailed upon a good number of individuals to contribute their interest towards the gratification of his desire. By these means a majority was secured; and they granted him a thirtieth of all moveables, for the ser∣vice of this undertaking. But this fund being insufficient, he levied a talliage on the cities, burroughs, and crown demesnes in Ireland, and demanded an aid from the clergy of that kingdom. Thus supplied with money, he sum∣moned all his military tenants to meet him with horses and arms at Win∣chester, on the twenty-seventh day of April; and in the mean time agreed to a match between his daughter Margaret, and Alexander, son to the king of Scotland, who, in consequence of this contract, undertook to preserve the peace in the northern parts of England. William, archbishop of York, was appointed guardian of the realm, a council assigned to assist him in the admini∣stration; and Henry setting sail from Portsmouth with his queen, his brother Richard, seven earls, three hundred knights, and thirty hogsheads of silver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<P>To oppose this formidable armament, the French king had fitted out a fleet of eighty galleys, at Rochelle; and assembled an army of four thou∣sand knights, and five times that number of gentlemen and bowmen, besides a vast multitude of infantry. With these he invaded Poitou, where he reduced several places belonging to the count de la Marche; and at length invested Fontenay, which after an obstinate defence was obliged to surrender at discre∣tion. He was employed in the siege, when Henry landing at Royane, sent embassadors to demand satisfaction for attacking the count de la Marche, whom he represented as the ally of England. Lewis replied that he was willing to re∣new the truce with the English king upon reasonable terms; but that Henry had no business to interpose between him and his rebellious subjects. This sen∣sible answer being construed into a refusal, was followed by a formal declaration of war; and Henry advanced to Pons, where he was joined by the nobles of Gascony, tho' he was very much disappointed in the number of those auxili∣aries. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he marched to Saintes, where he remained about a fortnight in hope of further reinforcements; and afterwards made a motion to Toney on the Charente, with a view to interrupt the progress of Lewis, who had by this time taken almost all the castles belonging to the count de la Marche. Here Henry engaged in a treaty with Geffrey de Rancone, lord of Taillebourg, in the neig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bourhood of which he took post, and had it in his power to se∣cure <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> town and castle, and break down the bridge, so as to prevent the Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> king from passing the river. But the count de la Marche, and Re∣naud
<PB N="495" REF="5040"/>
de Pons, by whose direction he acted, dissuaded him from taking these precautions, which could not fail to disoblige Geffrey, on whose honour they told him he might depend with the most perfect reliance: he therefore retired to Saintes; but hearing of the French king's approach, advanced again to Taillebourg, which he found already occupied by Lewis, who was likewise joined by Geffrey. As the English army was greatly inferior in number to that of the French king, Henry retreated with precipitation to Saintes; and Lewis passing the river, attacked his rear with such fury and expedition, that after an obstinate engagement, the English gave way, having sustained a con∣siderable loss. They were pursued to the neighbourhood of Saintes, where the count de la Marche making a sally to cover their retreat, the earls of Cornwal, Norfolk, Sarum, and Leicester, rallied their forces, and another battle en∣sued, which was fought on both sides with equal bravery and success. But Henry's army being greatly diminished, he quitted Saintes immediately, and made a hasty march to Pons, where leaving a good garrison, he proceeded to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.

<P>The count de la Marche was confounded and dismayed at the ex∣traordinary success of Lewis. He plainly perceived how little he could trust to the protection of the English king; and therefore resolved to take other mea∣sures for his own safety. He sent his eldest son to sue for some tolerable con∣ditions of peace; and he met with such a favourable reception from Lewis, that he himself, and his family, repaired to the French camp, and surrendered them∣selves at discretion. The French king generously pardoned the count, of whom he exacted nothing but three of his castles, which he kept as pledges of his promised fidelity. In all probability he would have pursued his success against the king of England, had not the plague broke out in his army, and himself been attacked by a languishing disorder that obliged him to desist. Perhaps these reasons were reinforced by some scruples of conscience he had expressed touching the oath which his father took to restore the dominions on the continent, that formerly belonged to the kings of England: be that as it will, he consented to a truce for five years, after having completed the conquest of Poitou. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry had by this time seen himself forsaken, and indeed betrayed, by almost all the Poitevins, on whose assistance and adherence he depended. He was in great danger of being besieged in Blaye, but now he was safe in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 124<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Bourdeaux, where he spent the winter among the Gascoigne nobility, in feast∣ing and riot, which, with the largesses he made to those Gascons, soon ex∣hausted his finances; so that he was obliged to write for a supply to the arch∣bishop of York, who received orders at the same time to confiscate the estates of some noblemen who had returned to England without his permission. The regent complied with his instructions so far as they regarded a remittance of money, which was immediately dispatched; but, he would not obey the other part of his orders, for fear of exciting a disturbance in the kingdom. By that time the money arrived at Bourdeaux, it was all anticipated, and Henry directed the archbishop to demand a year's wool of the Cistercians; which they absolutely refused to grant; and the regent unwilling to use compulsion, ob∣tained a considerable subsidy from the parliament, in order to disengage the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g entirely from the debts he had contracted. This was likewise misapplied,
<PB N="496" REF="5050"/>
and the archbishop pressed to use other expedients. He then attempted to bor∣row money in the king's name from wealthy individuals; but this odious practice produced such discontent and clamour, that he gave the king to un∣derstand all resources were stopped, and that there was an absolute necessity for his immediate return. Henry reduced to these circumstances, resolved in good earnest to quit Bourdeaux, and ordered all the noblemen in England to as∣semble at Portsmouth for his reception. Then he ratified the shameful truce with France, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which he bound himself to pay five thousand pounds a year to Lewis; and, at his arrival in England, gave directions for a magnificent entry into London, as if he had returned from conquest.</P>

<P>Before he embarked in this expedition, he had projected a match be∣tween his brother Richard, and Sanchia, third daughter of the count de Pro∣vence; and tho' this alliance was generally disliked by the English, who fore∣saw it would strengthen the interest of the Provensals in England, where it was already too powerful, the contract was adjusted, and the young lady ar∣riving under the auspices of her mother, the nuptials were pompously solem∣nized at Westminster. The earldom of Cornwal, with the honours of Eye and Wallingford, were confirmed to Richard, with a grant of five hundred pounds yearly to him and his heirs by this marriage: and after the rejoicings on this occasion, the old countess returned to her own country, with four thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry was now more necessitous than ever: he was immersed in debt, and so low in credit that he found it impracticable to borrow money for his most necessary occasions. Reduced to this contemptible situation, he issued writs directing his sheriffs to enquire into misdemeanours and trespasses against the law, by widows and others who had married without a licence, and en∣croachments upon royal forests; and considerable sums were raised from the fines produced by this enquiry. In order to chastise the Cistercians and Pre∣monstrants, who had refused him one year's wool, he forbade the exportation of that commodity; and this prohibition continued in force till they thought proper to comply with his demand. He extorted the substance of the Jews with such severity, that one Aaron of York was compelled to pay four marks of gold, and as many thousands of silver. As a great many of the Norman noblemen enjoyed estates in England, he, in imitation of the French king, gave them to understand that they must either become entirely French or Eng∣lish, and confiscated the estates of those who preserved their allegiance to<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<P>Yet all these expedients proved insufficient to relieve his wants, and supply his extravagance; and he resolved once more to sollicit a supply from parliament, which, tho' always averse to him in the beginning of every session, he generally found means to convert to his purpose by promises of re∣formation. At present he was furnished with a pretence by the king of Navarre, who had invaded Gascony, and some incursions of the Welsh. The barons being assembled at Westminster, he himself made the motion for a subsidy, which was heard with manifest signs of discontent. The prelates and the laity retiring separately, resolved that no grant should be made without their com∣mon consent; and that a committee of twelve persons should be chosen to con∣sider of proper measures to prevent all encroachments on the two charters. They
<PB N="497" REF="5060"/>
complained that writs had been issued out of chancery to the prejudice of their liberties; desired that they might have the nomination of the chancellor and justiciary; proposed that four noblemen of the king's council should be ap∣pointed conservators of the liberty of the kingdom, with power to inspect the treasury, and the application of the public's money; to summon a parliament as often as necessity should require; and arbitrate in all differences between the king and his subjects. They demanded that all writs contrary to the custom of the realm should be revoked; that censures should be published against all that opposed these regulations; that the chancellor and justiciary, chosen by consent of parliament, should always be two of the four conservators; that in case the king should deprive the chancellor of the seals, all writs signed by his successor should be null; that besides the chancellor and justiciary, the parlia∣ment should nominate two judges in the common pleas, two barons in the exchequer, and a justice of the Jews; and that all suspected persons should be removed from about the king's person. Henry was extremely alarmed at the nature of these demands, which did not at all suit with his high notions of the prerogative. He was incensed at the presumption of his vassals; but such was his character and situation, that he durst not avow his resentment. He therefore evaded their proposals with general promises of amendment, which he had no intention to perform; and after having tampered in vain with the mem∣bers, thought proper to prorogue the parliament.</P>

<P>During this session, one Martin was sent over, as nuncio from pope Innocent, the successor of Gregory, to procure an aid of ten thousand marks from the clergy, to maintain the war against the emperor, who at the same time dispatched embassadors to England, to justify his own conduct, and remonstrate against the demand of Innocent. The nation was so harrassed by those harpies, that they were glad of any pretence for denying his request; and this they were furnished with by the king; who forbade the prelates to lay im∣posts on the fees, which they held of the crown, to the detriment of his service. Martin, though baffled in this attempt, did not fail to exercise his legatine autho∣rity with equal tyranny and success; he exacted the arrears of a tenth of eccle∣siastical benefices, granted for the relief of the Holy-Land, as well as of the contributions for the support of the late pope Gregory; he laid grievous im∣positions on the prelates and religious houses; seized all the vacant benefices for the use of Innocent's chaplains and relations, and behaved with such des∣potism of ecclesiastical insolence and tyranny, that the English began to harbour the thoughts of freeing themselves entirely from the papal yoke.

This officer was immediately routed by David, who had the preceding day defeated a body of troops, commanded by the earl of Hereford and Ralph de Mortimer. The prince of Wales never doubted that Henry would employ all his forces against<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> him; and on that supposition had sollicited the protection of the pope, offering to become vassal of the Roman see, and pay to his holiness the tribute of five thousand marks, which had been imposed upon him by the king of England. Tho' this proposal was extremely agreeable to Innocent, he refused to give a determinate answer, until he should have enquired into the merits of the cause, and in particular examined whether or not the last treaty between Henry and David was the effect of compulsion, as the prince of Wales had alledged. For this purpose, he sent a commission to two Welsh abbots to set on foot an en∣quiry touching this pretended constraint; and in case it should should appear th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t David acted upon compulsion, they were vested with power to absolve him of his oath and annul the treaty. The two ecclesiastics, elated with this de∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of papal authority, summoned the king of England to appear before them as if he had been a simple villager, subject to their jurisdiction; an exam∣ple of infolence as which Henry and his subjects were equally incensed. And<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> now he heartily repented of having disbanded his army.

David, alarmed at the spirit of Henry and his council, who began to prepare for this invasion with uncommon vi∣gour, and even sent for a body of troops from Ireland, endeavoured to amuse the king with a negotiation, which produced no effect. A great council was assembled at Whitfuntide, in which it was resolved that his majesty should command the army in person. The military tenants of the crown were sum∣moned to appear at a certain rendezvous, and about the middle of August, he began his march for North Wales, through which he penetrated with∣out opposition to the river Conway, where he built the strong castle of Garinac, to overawe the Welsh and intercept their parties that should attempt to make incursions into the English territory. This fort effectually an∣swered all the purposes for which it was intended, and hampered the enemy so much that they could draw no supplies from Cheshire, while the troops from Ireland wasted the isle of Anglesey; and proclamation was made in all the marches, that no provision or merchandize should be carried into Wales under severe penalties; so that those ancient Britons were cooped up in the mountainous counties of Caernarvon and Merioneth, and reduced to a starving

Thus they continued till the death of prince David, which hap∣pened in the beginning of the next year; and as he left no issue the principa∣lity ought to have devolved to his nephew Roger de Mortimer; but the Welsh would not submit to the government of an Englishman, against whom they set up Llewellyn and David Goch, the two sons of Griffin. These shared the do∣minions of the late prince, and sued for peace to Henry, who granted their re∣quest on condition that they and their heirs for ever should hold of the crown of England, and furnish it with a thousand foot and four and twenty horse well armed and appointed, to serve in Wales and the Marches, when re∣quired, and five hundred men when their service should be wanted in any other place. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer</NOTE></P>

<P>The Welsh expedition being happily terminated, the nobility of England conferred together upon the tyranny of Rome, which was become altogether insupportable in the exactions of the nuncio Martin. They were mortified to see all the wealth of the nation exported to gratify the pope's ava∣rice and ambition; and perceiving how the clergy always suffered themselves to be mollified by the artifice and eloquence of the legates, resolved to exert them∣selves in putting a stop to such scandalous imposition. Without waiting for the protection of the king, upon which they could so little depend, they, of their own authority, ordered the governors of ports to apprehend all those who should bring bulls and mandates into the kingdom; and this order was so well obeyed, that in a very little time a courier was arrested in his way to the nuncio, loaded with these commissions, impowering him to levy money on divers pre∣tences. The nuncio loudly complained of this violence and insult, to the king, who ordered the papers to be restored; but the nobility made strong remon∣strances on the subject, and, in order to convince him of the prejudice done to his own subjects by favouring the papal innovations, presented him with a sche∣dule of the benefices enjoyed in England by Italian ecclesiastics; which exceeded the ordinary revenues of the crown. Henry was suprised at this information, but as he would not, of his own authority, venture to reform the abuse, for fear of incurring the pope's resentment, he permitted the noblemen to send ambassa∣dors in the name of the whole nation to the council at Lyon, with letters containing those grievances, and demanding immediate redress. Mean while, as they knew how dextrously the court of Rome invented delays and subter∣fuges, they determined to do themselves justice; and assembling on pretence of a tournament, sent a knight in their name to the nuncio, with a peremptory order to quit the kingdom without delay. Martin asked by whose authority he brought such an insolent message; and he replied by the authority of the whole nation, giving him to understand, that if in three days he should still be found in England, he must expect to be hewn in pieces. The nuncio forth∣with carried his complaints to the king; but finding Henry unable to protect him against his enemies, demanded a passport and departed immediately, to the inexpressible satisfaction of the people. The pope was so incensed at this affront that he could not help exclaiming, "I see plainly I must make peace with the emperor, in order to humble those petty princes; for the great dragon being once appeased, we shall find no difficulty in crushing those smaller serpents."</P>

All the answer they received to the remon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce was the pope's general promise to take their complaints into consideration; and finding his aim was to amuse them with evasive excuses, they protested against the tribute, and returned to their own country. Immediately after their departure, Innocent, in order to fascinate the eyes of the council, upon which the complaints of the English had made some impression, declared that he would immediately reform those abuses; and published two bulls in favour of the English nation: the first permitted patrons to enjoy the right of presen∣tation; and the other implied that when an Italian incumbent should die, his benefice might be granted to a native. But with respect to the tribute, far from relinquishing that claim, he wrote menacing letters to the English pre∣lates, expressly enjoining them to confirm and subscribe the charter by which John acknowleged himself as a vassal and tributary to the holy see. How∣soever the bishops were shocked at this demand, they were intimidated into compliance by the threats of ecclesiastical censure; though Henry himself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

<P>Innocent, being exasperated at the remonstrance of the English ambassadors, and the refractory behaviour of Henry, endeavoured to persuade the king of France, during an interview at Cluny, to expel that prince from his dominions, or at least reduce him to an absolute submission to the papal autho∣rity. But Lewis excused himself from engaging in such an undertaking, con∣trary to the terms of his truce with England, his affinity with Henry, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1246.</NOTE> dictates of common justice. He, in his turn, pressed the pope to a reconci∣liation with the emperor; which that pontiff declined, and afterwards hired russians to assassinate Frederic, after having endeavoured to dethrone him, by raising up a competitor in the person of Henry, landgrave of Thuringia, and raised contributions to maintain his title as if it had been a war of religion. The English nation was, by this time, extremely irritated against the pope, who seemed to despise their resentment, and proceeded in his exactions with
<PB N="501" REF="5100"/>
redoubled vigour. He demanded of the English prelates, a number of knights to serve in the army of the church a whole year at their own expence; and, by his sole authority, granted the profits of all vacant benefices within the province of Canterbury, for one year to archbishop Boniface. He levied the six thousand marks assessed on the prelates by his nuncio; the twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues, according to a decree of the council at Lyon; one third of the income of all benefices, exceeding the yearly rent of one hundred marks, and a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety of the prebends and livings of non-resident canons and clergymen; exactions which, according to computation, amounted to eighty thousand marks, a sum thought equivalent to the whole specie of the kingdom, and this to be exported for three years successively. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE></P>

<P>A parliament meeting in Mid-lent at London, these grievances were taken into consideration; and, as they would not yet lay aside all respect for the pope, they resolved to renew their complaints at the court of Rome, to which three letters of expostulation were immediately sent by the king, the pre∣lates, and the barons; and these were committed to the charge of William de Powick, and Henry de la Mare, who had instructions to second them with per∣sonal remonstrances. Mean while, Innocent seemed to be transported with the desire of driving the English to despair. He claimed the personal estates of ec∣clesiastics who died intestate, all goods fraudulently acquired, provided the right owner did not appear, all effects amassed by usury, and all legacies granted for restitution and pious uses. He appointed the Dominicans his commissioners for levying these exactions, which the king himself had not power to prevent. He had ventured to prohibit the levy of the six thousand marks, and the payment of any talliage or contribution to the pope, till the return of the agents: but, notwithstanding this order, it was collected by several bishops, whom the pope had charged to excommunicate all recusants. At length the deputies returned; and, in a parliament held at Winchester, made such a report of their embassy, as plainly proved how little they were to expect from negotiation. Innocent had treated their envoys with contempt; and, instead of redressing their grie∣vances, declared that he would proceed to the same censures with the king of England, which he had inflicted upon the emperor. The assembly, fired with indignation at these menaces, persuaded the king to renew the prohibition under the most severe penalties; and this exasperated the pope, in his turn, to such a degree, that he forthwith dispatched an order to W. de Canteloup, bishop of Worcester, to take measures for the payment of the contribution-money to his nuncio, at the new temple, before a certain day, on pain of suspension and ex∣communication. Henry at first appeared resolute to maintain the liberties of the nation; but his courage was not proof against the menaces of this prelate and other bishops, who threatened the kingdom with an interdict; while his own brother Richard espoused, in a very insolent and indecent manner, the in∣terest of his holiness, who had secured his assistance, by a grant of the money arising from the commutation of vows made to engage in the crusade. These considerations were powerful enough to have staggered the resolution of a more courageous prince than Henry, who was therefore obliged to submit; and the people were delivered over as a prey to the insolence and rapine of a Roman pontiff. In vain did the abbots and clergy complain of these extortions, to the next parliament. There was not sufficient vigour left among the barons, to
<PB N="502" REF="5110"/>
withstand the faction of the pope, and the interest of Richard, who acted as his abettor; and all they could do in their own behalf, was to dispatch new agents with a second remonstrance to Innocent, declaring it impossible for the kingdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1247.

<P>Not but that Innocent relaxed in some trifles, with a shew of mode∣ration, which was, in all probability, owing to the unfavourable posture of his affairs. The landgrave of Thuringia, in support of whose pretensions he had expended above fifty thousand pounds, was routed in a pitched battle, the loss of which he did not long survive. But this triumph of Frederic seemed to in∣crease the rancour of his holiness, who now resolved to set up another competi∣tor against him, in the person of William, count of Holland. In order to defray the expence of this new project, he sent four legates into different coun∣tries to raise contributions; and dispatched two fransciscan friars into England, where they did not pretend to use compulsion, but obtained a licence from the king to beg as mendicants, for the pope's occasions. They had no sooner gained this point, than they assumed powers of a very different nature; and sent circu∣lar letters to bishops, abbots, and monasteries, demanding exorbitant sums; which, however, the prelates refused to pay, without the approbation of parlia∣ment. The pope, incensed at their refusal, sent over one of his chaplains, called Marino, to enforce the demand by dint of legatine authority, from which the bishops appealed both to the pope and parliament; but, meeting with redress from neither, they and the monasteries were fain to compound for a large sum of money. The forbearance of the English, under such grievous oppres∣sion, appears amazing to those who do not consider the superstition of the times, and the miseries of a civil war, which were still fresh in the remembrance of the nation. Henry was a prince of such contemptible talents, that the sub∣jects would run no risque in his behalf, from any personal attachment to him or his family; and it was equally disagreeable to them whether they should be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>This impolitic monarch still continued to exhibit marks of his odious partiality to foreigners. Peter de Savoye, earl of Richmond, arriving from Provence, with some maidens of that country, whom he brought over to be matched among the English nobility, two of them were immediately dis∣posed in marriage to the king's wards, Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and Richard de Burgh; and Peter himself was gratified with a grant of all the ho∣nour of Aquila in Sussex. Henry's three uterine brothers, called Guy de Lu∣signan, William and Aymer de Valence, arrived about the same time with their sister Alice, to profit by the king's bounty.

William was knighted, and indulged with a grant of the honour of Hertford; Aymer being in orders, was provided with several wealthy benefices, and afterwards elected bishop of Winchester; and Alice was married to the young earl of Warenne. These strangers were followed by Beatr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x, countess of Provence, now a widow, and her brother Thomas, late count of Flanders, and were received with open arms by Henry, though he himself was unable to defray the ordinary expence of his hous∣hold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrel.</NOTE> For want of ready money, he was fain to plunder foreign merchants, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as his own subjects, of such necessaries and provisions as he wanted; and

his brother Richard took the advantage of his distress. The coin had been di∣minished one third in its value, by the villainy of Jews and Flemings, who traded in England for wool; and as this evil required an immediate remedy, people were forbidden to take damaged money, and ordered to bring it to the king's mint, where it should be changed. Richard knowing the profits of a re∣coinage were very considerable, took this opportunity of demanding the pay∣ment of a sum which he had lent to the king upon usury, and importuned him so much, that in order to quiet his clamour, Henry bestowed upon him a grant for seven years, of the farm of the mint for a third part of the profits.</P>

<P>These largesses and alienations reduced him to such indigence, that he was obliged to have recourse again to his parliament, which had met in February at Westminster: but, when he demanded a supply, they re∣proached him with his profusion to foreigners and want of oeconomy, and ab∣solutely refused to relieve his necessities. They complained of his retaining vacant benefices in his own hands, discouraging commerce by clogging it with heavy duties, and conferring the first posts of the kingdom upon persons void of talents and integrity. They therefore insisted upon the same demands which they had made in a former session, touching the nomination of a chancellor and justiciaries; and the king, perceiving from their complexion that they were not in a complying humour, prorogued them immediately, that he might prepare himself for their next assault. During this interval, instead of taking popular measures to appease the resentment of the barons, he seemed to attach himself more strongly than ever to his foreign favourites, and doubtless by their advice, attempted to intimidate the parliament at their next meeting. He inveighed against them for endeavouring to impose laws upon him, which they themselves would never endure: he observed that every master of a pri∣vate family chose his own confidants and counsellors, and retained or dis∣missed his domestics at his own pleasure; whereas he, though a king, was treated like a slave by his own subjects: but, far from changing his officers according to their capricious humour, he was determined to be master in his own kingdom, and to teach them it was their province to obey. Then he pro∣mised, in general terms, to redress the grievances of the nation; and concluded with demanding an immediate subsidy, that might enable him, at the expiration of the truce, to recover the dominions on the continent which his ancestors pos∣sessed. The barons, piqued at this stately declaration, replied in the same strain, that, seeing he was not disposed to reform his conduct, they should not be so indiscrect as to impoverish themselves, to feed the avarice of foreigners, under the notion of imaginary conquests. From this answer Henry, despair∣ing of obtaining succour from this quarter, dissolved them immediately, lest they should proceed to more disagreeable resolutions; and his coffers being quite exhausted, was fain to sell his plate and jewels, which immediately found pur∣chasers among the citizens of London: a circumstance that mortified him ex∣tremely, as they had so often pleaded poverty whenever he demanded a supply. He resolved to manifest his resentment, by establishing a new fair at Westmin∣ster, during which he prohibited all trade in London; and, instead of regard∣ing the representations of the merchants on this subject, he passed the Christmas holidays in their city, that he might have an opportunity to exact an exorbi∣tant new-year's gift, which nevertheless did not excuse them from further impo∣sition;

These small sums being altogether insufficient to relieve his necessities, he en∣deavoured to borrow money from individuals; and notwithstanding the most abject importunities, met with very little success. Indeed the pretence he used for borrowing, was such as justified the repulses he sustained: for, in the writs for this loan, he declared a resolution to attack the territories of France, which were at that time under the pope's immediate protection, as Lewis had been<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

He was defeated and taken prisoner by the soldan of Egypt, and his country exhausted of men and money. W. Longue-espée, earl of Salisbury, and two hundred English knights, had embarked in this enterprize; and the earl was slain in the battle fought at Damietta, after having signalized his courage in several engagements. Those crusades were productive of infinite mischiefs to Christendom, though they filled the coffers of the pope, whose emissaries levied immense sums, enflaming weak people by their sermons into fits of enthu∣siasm, during which they crossed themselves and took the vow; and from this they were afterwards glad to purchase absolution.</P>

<P>The fashion of taking the cross was so prevalent at this junc∣ture, that Henry himself, in the midst of all his necessities, professed himself a soldier of Christ: though, in all probability, this step was the effect of some<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1250.</NOTE> other motive more cogent than his religion. Perhaps he saw no other prospect of paying his debts, which were by this time become very burthensome and dis∣graceful, than that of obtaining a subsidy on pretence of equipping an arma∣ment for Palestine: or else he was desirous of putting himself under the pope's protection, which he thought would screen him from the designs that might be hatched to his prejudice. He seemed to suspect something of this kind, from the ambition of his brother Richard, who had made a mysterious journey to Rome, accompanied by the earl of Gloucester, and several noblemen and prelates. He had been caressed by the pope at Lyon, who admitted him to several private conferences, the subject of which afforded great speculation; and, as he had always been the chief of the malecontents, Henry might very naturally suspect him of some design to his prejudice. When Henry took the cross, his example was followed by five hundred knights, some of whom had sold their estates to defray the expence of their voyage; and they expressed the utmost impatience to set out upon the expedition: but as the king was not yet in a condition to perform his vow, he forbad them to cross the sea, until he himself should depart; and this prohibition was, at his desire, confirmed by the pope. At the same time, his holiness indulged him with the grant of a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues in England and Ireland for three years, to be levied and desposited until the king should set out upon his voyage. Henry endeavoured to save money, by retrenching the expences of his houshold: he set on foot an inquisition into trespasses, appointed commissioners to examine into escheats and alienations of the crown-demesnes, with a view to raise sums by fines and resumptions; and laid a talliage upon the Jews, who never failed<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Henry de Bathe, one of the judges, was amerced in a considerable sum, on pretence of his having allowed a criminal to escape; Philip Lovel was severely fined on an accusation of bribery by the Jews, from whom he had collected the talliage; a company of Italian mer∣chants

called Causini, were prosecuted for usury, and obliged to compound for money; and every scheme that could be contrived for this purpose was put in execution. Simor de Montfort, earl of Leicester, had made consider∣able progress in Guienne, and now returning to sollicit a supply of money for prosecuting his success, received part of those exactions, with which he went back and raised a body of Brabantines and cross-bow men, who contributed to the reduction of the malecontent barons in that province.</P>

<P>Alexander, king of Scotland, dying, was succeeded by his son of the same name, who, though still a boy, began to secure some places on the border of England, and seemed to threaten an invasion. Henry forthwith as∣sembled a numerous army, and began his march towards the north to oppose the progress of the Scottish king; but, before he proceeded to hostilities, John Mansel was sent before to treat of an accommodation. This was easily effected by means of the match between Margaret, daughter of Henry, and young Alexander, who repaired to York on a visit to the English monarch, by whom he was knighted; and the marriage-ceremony was performed with great so∣lemnity, in presence of Henry and the queen-mother of Scotland, attended by the chief nobility of both kingdoms. Alexander, on this occasion, did homage to his father-in-law for Lothian, but absolutely refused to acknow∣lege the dependence of his whole kingdom, until he should have deliberated with his parliament upon an affair of such consequence; and Henry admitted the excuse. The nuptials being solemnized with great magnificence, Alexan∣der received a bond for five thousand marks as the portion of his wife, with whom he returned to his own country, whither she was attended by Maude de Canteloupe, and some discreet ladies appointed to superintend her education.</P>

Innocent, in order to prevent delays, was no sooner informed of their contumacy, than he accommodated Henry with fresh bulls, granting him a twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues, a tenth of all the lands belonging to prelates, the crusade commutation money, and that which the pope claimed as arising from stolen goods, usury, and legacies for charitable uses; at the same time, he took the king and his dominions under his imme∣diate protection. Over and above these resources, Henry laid a talliage on all his demesnes, as well as upon those that had been alienated from the crown; nor were the late conquests in Wales exempted from this imposition.</P>

<P>After a sufficient fund had been thus provided, the king's de∣parture was delayed by the disturbances of Gascony. Deputies arrived from that province, with complaints against the earl of Leicester, by whom the natives were oppressed; and Simon himself came over to justify his conduct. Not contented with denying the imputations cast upon his government, he, with great heat and indecency, upbraided the king for listening to such frivo∣lous complaints against a man who had served him so faithfully, and even ex∣pended
<PB N="506" REF="5150"/>
his whole fortune in an employment, by which other governors had been enriched. Henry assured him, that he did not believe the accusations; and that in order to manifest his innocence, he would send commissaries into Guienne, to examine into the conduct of the inhabitants; in the mean time, as a convincing proof of his confidence and regard, he supplied him with a sum of money, and desired he would hold himself in readiness to return and reassume his administration. The Gascons being informed of the king's intention, depu∣ted the archbishop of Bourdeaux to repeat their complaints, and renew their pe∣tition for another governor; and during this prelate's residence at London, the commissioners returned from Gascony, where they had examined the dispute between the earl and the people. Their report was favourable to Leicester: but as the archbishop assured the king, that if he should return, there would be a total revolt in the province, Henry, rather than run the risque of such a re∣bellion, resolved to sacrifice Leicester to their resentment; and ordered the ar∣ticles of his impeachment to be carried before his peers, that he might be tried by the laws of the kingdom. The earl, knowing the king's caprice and incon∣stancy, had, by this time, engaged prince Richard, with the earl of Glouces∣ter, and several powerful noblemen in his interest; thus supported he appeared in court, and vindicated himself in such a manner as seemed satisfactory to his judges, who were indeed resolved to acquit him whatsoever should happen. The archbishop of Bourdeaux was brow-beaten, and so confounded by the partiality of the bench, that he could hardly proceed with his evidence: Henry himself was irritated to such a degree by the insolence of Leicester, that, in the transport of his passion, he could not help venting some injurious expres∣sions, which provoked Montfort to accuse him of ingratitude, and demand, in the most arrogant manner, the recompence he had so often promised, in consi∣deration of his manifold services. The king answered, in a rage of indigna∣tion, that he did not think himself obliged to perform his promise to a traitor: and this word was no sooner pronounced, than the other told him he lied; that he believed he never went to confession, or if he did, it was not attended with repentance. <Q>“I never repented any thing so much (said the king) as my hav∣ing lavished so many favours upon a man like you, so destitute of gratitude and decorum.”</Q> So saying, he intended to arrest the earl upon the spot; but perceiving a number of the barons ready to protect him, his indignation gave way to his fear, and he was fain to smother his resentment: he even listened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

He renewed the hostilities which the truce had interrupted, and attacked the nobility with implacable fury and revenge: but his passion hurried him into such indiscretion and misconduct, that he at length found himself besieged in Montauban, and was obliged to purchase a capitulation by setting all his pri∣soners at liberty. Chagrined at this disgrace, he resigned his government and retired into France; though not before he had delivered three of the strongest castles to the revolters, and involved the province in civil war, confusion, and anarchy.

With this view, he issued writs for a general muster of those who were obliged to have arms, that they might be in a con∣dition to keep watch and ward in all the towns and cities, and maintain the peace of the nation in his absence; then he prepared a fund for defraying the expence of the expedition, by raising an aid upon his own demesnes, and sum∣moning all who possessed fifteen pounds a year by military tenure, to come and receive knighthood. He raised money by dispensing with the execution of some ordinances made against the Jews; and, as he had a right to demand a scutage of all his military tenants for the knighting of his eldest son, he assem∣bled a parliament at Westminster, in hope that the barons would settle it at a higher rate than he would chuse to assess by his own authority.</P>

<P>Upon this occasion, he explained the situation of Gascony, and the necessity for taking vigorous measures for the recovery of that pro∣vince. After long debates the laity agreed to the scutage, and the prelates consented to the imposition, according to the pope's bull, which they had for∣merly rejected. But they complained of the king's having over-ruled the elections of bishops and abbots, contrary to the first article of the magna charta; and insisted upon satisfaction for these grievances. The king had ex∣pected the demand, and prepared his answer accordingly. He owned that, upon some occasions, he had extended the royal prerogative too far; but that he had laid down a firm resolution to reform his conduct, and would take care to observe the charters with the utmost punctuality. In pursuance of this de∣claration, he, of his own accord, convened all the lords spiritual and temporal in Westminster-Hall, where every individual appeared with a lighted taper in his hand, while the king himself stood with his hand upon his heart, in token of his sincerity. Then the archbishop of Canterbury pronounced aloud, a most dreadful anathema against all those who should directly or indirectly oppose the execution of the two charters; or violate, diminish, or change in any shape, the laws and constitutions of the kingdom. This execration being de∣nounced, the two charters were read with an audible voice, and confirmed by his majesty; and each nobleman dashing his taper on the ground, wished<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

Mean while, he summoned his military tenants to meet him at Portsmouth, on the twenty-second of June, and laid an embargo on the shipping for their trans∣portation to the continent: but, that he might leave no ill blood in the king∣dom, he thought proper to reconcile himself to the citizens of London, whom he had provoked by the most arbitrary acts of oppression.

<P>This salutary measure being taken, he appointed the queen guar∣dian of the realm, to be ruled by the direction of his brother Richard, in whose custody he left the great seal; and embarking at Portsmouth on the sixth day of August, arrived about the middle of the month at Bourdeaux, which he found very much hampered by the garrisons of Fronsac, Benanges, and La Reole. These had been given up treacherously to the Gascon revolters by Simon de Montfort, but they were soon reduced by the English forces, who drove the rebels out of the province, and compelled their chief Gaston de<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As this monarch threatened a new invasion of Gascony, Henry wrote to the queen and prince Richard for an immediate reinforcement; and a parliament was im∣mediately summoned to meet at Westminster, where the lay nobility entered into a resolution, to meet in the beginning of May at London, and proceed immediately to Portsmouth, where they would take shipping for Gascony, provided the king of Castile should invade that province. The prelates of Canterbury, Winchester, London, and Worcester, engaged to serve in per∣son, and the other bishops promised considerable supplies of money. The military tenants of the crown in Ireland, were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to embark at Waterford immediately after Easter; and an aid was demanded from the prelates and barons of that kingdom, assembled for the purpose at Dublin. In England the same measures were pursued: all who held twenty pounds a year in capite of the king, or of minors in his wardship, were ordered to appear at Portsmouth on the day of rendezvous; and writs were issued to the sheriffs, commanding them to return two legal and dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reet knights, to rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sent each county before the king's council at Westminster, to

<P>Henry, whose genius was not at all calculated for war, proposed terms of accommodation to the king of Castile, and even to engage in a league with him, cemented by a marriage between Alphonso's half sister Eleanor and prince Edward, on whom he now bestowed a grant of Ireland, with the earl∣dom of Chester, the town and castle of Bristol, and all his dominions on the continent, whether usurped by foreign power or in actual possession of the crown of England. This treaty was negotiated by Peter bishop of Hereford and John Mansel provost of Beverley, who set out with the character of am∣bassadors for the court of Castile, where they met with such a favourable recep∣tion, that in the beginning of April the marriage-contract was settled, together with the articles of a treaty offensive and defensive, importing that Alphonso should give up all claim to Gascony; that Henry should assist him in his war against the king of Navarre, bestow his daughter on Alphonso's brother, and use his influence with the pope to commute his vow to serve in Palestine, for an expedition against the infidels of Africa; that Gaston de Bearne and the other lords who adhered to the king of Castile, should be restored to the pos∣session of their estates; and that prince Edward should be brought to Bour∣deaux immediately, and proceed to Burgos, so that he might be knighted by his Castilian majesty, and married to his sister within five weeks after Michael∣mas. In consequence of this treaty young Edward, being now in the sixteenth year of his age, went over with his mother and sister Beatrice to Bourdeaux, where he ratified the articles relating to his alliance, then proceeded to the court of Castile, where he was received with great honours, and universally ad∣mired. Here he remained for some time after the solemnization of his nup∣tials, and returned to Bourdeaux before his father quitted that city. Henry, unwilling to run the risque of a long passage by sea, resolved to travel by land to Calais; and taking Paris in his way, was sumptuously entertained by Lewis just then returned from Palestine. From that capital he continued his route to the sea-side, and arrived at Dover about the latter end of December. He made a magnificent entry into London, the citizens of which presented him with one hundred pounds, and a massy piece of plate of curious workmanship. But he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>During this expedition to Guienne, Henry had contracted a heavy load of debt, not only by the expence of his son's marriage, but also by an inconsiderate contract with pope Innocent, who, not contented with perse∣cuting the emperor Frederic to his dying day, was resolved to effect the ruin of his whole family. He had carried on a war against Frederic's two sons Con∣rad and Henry, and sent his nuncio Albert into England, with an offer of the crown of Sicily to Richard, earl of Cornwal, who declined the proposal of en∣gaging in an expensive war against his own nephew. Henry was not so scru∣pulous; for the same scheme being offered to his consideration, in favour of his second son Edmund, he submitted to all the conditions imposed by his ho∣liness; engaged himself and his realm for unlimited sums, supplied him with
<PB N="510" REF="5190"/>
all the money in his own exchequer, as well as with what he could extort from the Jews, who were miserably oppressed; together with the sums he could bor∣row from his brother Richard, and the Italian merchants, at exorbitant in∣terest. By this time indeed his enterprize assumed a more honourable aspect; for his nephew Henry had been assassinated at Melphi by the direction of his own brother Conrad, who was in his turn poisoned by his bastard brother Main<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roy. This illegitimate son of Frederic ascended the throne of Sicily. What was before the effect of revenge, in pope Innocent, now adopted the colour of justice: he assembled an army to dethrone the usurper; but his troops were routed, and himself in danger of being besieged in Rome by the conqueror. It was on the back of this disaster that he repeated his instances to Henry, who racked his own credit to the utmost stretch, with a view to retrieve the affairs of his holiness, and enable him to conquer Sicily for his son Edmund.</P>

<DIV4 N="83" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the midst of these transactions Innocent died, and was suc∣ceeded in the papacy by Alexander IV. who adopted the projects of his pre∣decessor, maintained the war in Apuglia, and gratified Edmund with the in∣vestiture of the kingdom of Sicily, performed with the ring by the bishop of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> Bologna, sent over to England for that purpose. He was likewise impowered to absolve Henry of his vow for the Palestine expedition, provided he would make another for transporting an army into Apuglia: and he accordingly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brady.</NOTE> swore, by his tutelar saint Edward, that he would go thither in person. While the bishop was on the road, Alexander's forces were utterly defeated at Nocera by Mainfroy, who by this victory made himself master of Apuglia, and was crowned king of the two Sicilies at Palermo. Though the bishop was well informed of this unlucky revolution in the affairs of Alexander, he men∣tioned not a word of the defeat to Henry, who ordered the ceremony of the investiture to be performed with great magnificence, and vainly expected to extract considerable subsidies from his people for the support of this new dig∣nity. In this hope he convoked a parliament, of which he demanded a sup∣ply of money with as much confidence as if he had engaged in some important scheme for the advantage of the nation. But the barons were very little in∣terested in the affairs of Sicily; though they promised to grant a subsidy, on condition that the two charters should be punctually observed, and the lord high treasurer and justiciary appointed by parliament, independent of the king's authority. Henry, averse to these proposals, prorogued the parlia∣ment, and repaired to Scotland to manage the interest of his daughter, who complained of the regency of that kingdom, involved in the troubles that com∣monly attend a king's minority.</P>

<P>Having quelled the disturbances of Scotland, he returned to his own dominions, where his presence was necessary to adjust the particulars of his Sicilian project; and now he found it absolutely impossible to pay the sums which had been borrowed by the late pope in his name, for the reduction of that kingdom. He could not even hush the clamours of his creditors; and though Alexander was not ignorant of his distress, he practised every method he could invent to drain more money from this exhausted kingdom. He sent over a nuncio called Rustan, with bulls for raising contributions on the clergy. The first which this legate produced, impowered him to levy the tythes in England, Ireland, and even in Scotland, for the use of the pope and king
<PB N="511" REF="5200"/>
Henry. He afterwards published a second bull, proposing to commute the vow of a pilgrimage to Palestine, for another to serve against Mainfroy as an enemy of the christian name; and a crusade was preached up for this purpose, with promise of a general indulgence to all those who should assist the holy see in deposing that excommunicated usurper. The parliament being reassembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> Henry renewed his demand of a subsidy with the more confidence, as he had omitted to summon those barons who appeared the most refractory in the last session. But he found this assembly staunch to the same sentiments; and they even turned his own artifice against himself, by affirming they could not com∣ply with his demand, in the absence of those who having a right to sit in parlia∣ment, were not summoned to attend. Thus disappointed, he dismissed the assembly, and converted his attention to other expedients. He in vain at∣tempted to borrow sums from his brother Richard, who was incensed at his engaging in such an enterprize, without his concurrence or advice; and this resource failing, he was obliged to depend upon the exactions of the pope, au∣thorized by bulls which no person of candour or sensibility can read without indignation. This rapacious pontiff, not only oppressed England with the most shameful impositions, but even burthened Scotland and Norway with contributions to maintain his own private interest. To this he sacrificed the christians in Palestine, by converting the sums and soldiers destined for their relief to the conquest of Sicily, to which he could have no just pretension: practices so little suitable to the character of a patriarch, that they even disgrace humanity.</P>

<DIV4 N="85" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXXXV.</HEAD>
<P>Henry himself was made a dupe to the avarice and villainy of Alexander; for the immense sums levied on pretence of raising Edmund to the throne of Sicily, were chiefly appropriated to the pope's own private oc∣casions, while Mainfroy enjoyed his crown without molestation. The debt contracted in the name of Henry for the atchievement of this enterprize, amounted according to Alexander's accompt to one hundred thirty five thou∣sand five hundred and forty marks of silver, exclusive of interest; and as he knew the king's revenues were hardly sufficient for the expence of his household, he contrived a notable scheme of fraud and oppression, to discharge this incum∣brance. A great number of obligatory bills were expedited, owning the re∣ceipt of particular sums of money from certain merchants of Sienna and Flo∣tence; and these he proposed that the English clergy should subscribe, for sums proportioned to the benefices of each individual. When Rustan assembled the prelates on this occasion, and signified the demand of his holiness, the bishop of London declared that he would rather lose his head than submit to such tyranny. He was seconded by the bishop of Worcester; and the whole assembly made answer that the clergy of England would not be enslaved by the pope. The nuncio complained of this refusal to Henry, who told the bishop of London he would make him feel the effects of his indignation. The prelate, far from being dismayed, replied that he knew the king and the pope were his superiors; but that should they deprive him of his mitre he would supply its place with a helmet. The nuncio not yet repulsed had re∣course to private negotiation. He with the assistance of the bishop of Here∣ford, who had engaged in the project from the beginning, cajoled some pre∣lates with promises, and intimidated others with threats of prosecutions and ex∣communication,

t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> at length he had prepared th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m for implicit obedience. Then he convoked another assembly; but the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hbishop of Canterbury being abroad and the see of York vacant, the prelates made use of these pretences for postponing the det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmination of this affair, and Rustan could not deny their request; tho' he insulted in the most virulent terms two ecclesiastics who vent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to explain their sentiments on the injustice of such a demand. The d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay produced nothing favourable to the clergy. The term of respite which they ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d was no sooner expired than they were again assembled at London, and the nuncio renewed his demand. Leonard, agent for the clergy, replied that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir poverty would not permit them to comply with the pope's mandate, which besides was highly unreasonable and unjust. Rustan alledged that all the churches belonged to his holiness, who might therefore dispose of them according to his pleasure. Leonard denied this position, observing that al∣though the churches acknowledged the pope as their superior and protector, they never owned him as their proprietor; nor had he a better right to the effects of the clergy than the king had to the estates of his people. The nun∣cio, enraged at this answer, which he could not refute, demanded aloud that every individual should speak for himself; so as that the sentiments of each might be known to his holiness. His intention was to terrify the assembly; but this behaviour produced a contrary effect: the prelates incensed at his ar∣rogance declared unanimously that they neither could nor would submit to such an unjust exaction; and that they would suffer death rather than alter their re∣solution. Rustan, conscious of his own indiscretion, changed his battery, and en∣deavoured to appease their resentment with softer expressions. He said he would return to Rome, and endeavour to mitigate the demand of his holiness; and the dean of St. Paul's was deputed by the clergy to explain the motives<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1256.</NOTE> of their refusal. Alexander pretended that the sums had been really borrowed for the service of the king and the church of England; and proposed another expedient, from which he would not recede. He insisted upon their paying the bills according to his first calculation, but agreed that the sums should be de∣ducted from the tythes which might be granted to his majesty in the sequel; and to this determination the clergy of England were obliged to submit. This di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ference was no sooner compromised, than the nuncio demanded one year's wool from the Cistercians for the pope's occasions; and they answered, that they could not comply with the demand until it should be considered in a general chapter of the order. Rustan, exasperated at this evasion, swore that since he could not persuade them in a body, he would be revenged on each in particular; and began to prosecute the individuals for pretended faults, which he obliged them to attone by the payment of considerable sums. But they com∣plained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Act. Pub.</NOTE> of this tyranny to the pope, with whom they had such influence that he ordered the nuncio to desist from his prosecutions.</P>

<P>During these disputes between the pope and the clergy, the king exerted all his influence in solliciting the barons to grant the subsidy he had demanded for elevating prince Edmund to the Sicilian throne. The arch∣bishop of Messina was sent with letters from the pope to the nobility, exhort∣ing them in the most earnest manner to comply with the request of their so∣vereign. But the eagerness of his holiness defeated the purpose which it was intended to serve; for the barons perceived that the subsidy would pass
<PB N="513" REF="5220"/>
through the hands of Alexander, whose integrity they had so much reason to doubt; and they were extremely unwilling to send forces into Italy, where they would be exposed to inevitable ruin. They, therefore, refused to com∣ply with the king's demand, alledging that the enterprize was dangerous, and the kingdom impoverished; that they should run the risque of an inva∣sion by unfurnishing the kingdom of its troops; that the scheme was pro∣jected without the consent of parliament; and that the gift of the kingdom of Sicily was clogged with such restrictions by the pope, as rendered it altogether precarious, and unworthy of the expence with which it was attended. Thus repulsed by the parliament, he renewed his attack upon the clergy; and, with the pope's assistance, extorted from them a continuation of the tythes which were granted at first for the term of three years only. He likewise pro∣ceeded with his exactions from the Londoners, and other cities of the king∣dom; and even extended his acts of oppression to the Welsh, whom he con∣sidered as his own subjects, and fleeced accordingly. At length their patience being exhausted with their substance, they had recourse to their arms, and in∣demnified themselves by carrying off a great booty from the territories of England; while the indigence of Henry obliged him to sit still and behold his dominions thus ravaged with impunity. Mean while the pope, whose avarice was insatiable, continually importuned this weak prince for fresh sup∣plies of money, and even threatened to revoke his gift of Sicily, unless Henry would immediately perform his promise of sending English forces into Italy. The king represented his utter inability to defray the expence of such an ex∣pedition; but accommodated him with five thousand marks, and commanded prince Edward, his successor, to ratify the Sicilian convention: at the same time he complained of the inflexibility of his barons, who had absolutely re∣fused to support him in the prosecution of his design.</P>

<P>Alexander concluding from this information that his influ∣ence in England drew near a period, resolved to improve the present oppor∣tunity to the utmost of his power; and with this view sent John de Die as his nuncio, with a fresh cargo of bulls for raising money to pay the king's pretended debts to his holiness. By the first, he ordered the bishops to pay the tythes granted to the king without the deduction which had been stipulated: a second granted to the king all the revenues of vacant bishoprics, on pretence of helping to defray his voyage to the Holy Land, tho' he himself had already agreed to a commutation of this engagement. A third indulged him with all the revenues of such ecclesiastics as did not reside in their benefices: by a fourth he was intitled to the tythes of all ecclesiastical revenues according to their just valuation, whereas they were hitherto rated according to ancient taxation: a fifth impowered Rustan to adjudge in the king's favour the im∣moveables of all ecclesiastics who should die intestate: a sixth directed the nuncio to lay a tax upon all the clergy of the kingdom, for the assistance of their sovereign, notwithstanding any privileges or exemptions granted by his predecessors, or any opposition that should be made to his authority: in a seventh he excommunicated all the prelates who should not pay their pro∣portion within the term prescribed; and several other mandates concurred in prosecution of the same purpose of rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing money to satisfy the pretended cre∣ditors

The election of Richard was very disagreeable to the king of France, situated between the two powers of England and Germany, which might unite against him, in order to recover the dominions which had formerly belonged to their<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> ancestors. In this apprehension he fortified his frontiers, and endeavoured to intercept the earl of Gloucester, and John Mansel, whom Richard had sent to Germany to make their observations on the country and state of the prin∣ces, before he would venture himself among them; for, tho' he had bribed a majority, the other electors were very clamorous, the bishop of Triers declared for Alphonso, and even promised great sums to those who would espouse the cause of that monarch. Richard having received a favourable account from his agents, resolved to go thither in person; and knowing the venal disposition of the Germans, he laid in such a store of money as no sovereign prince in Europe could have raised on the like occasion. This he collected not only from his vast estate, but also from his farm of the mint, and from the Jews, for whom he procured an exemption from talliage for the space of five years. Thus furnished, he embarked at Yarmouth, with the bishops of Cologne, Liege, and Utrecht, Florence count of Holland, and several Ger∣man noblemen, who had come to England, in order to accompany him in his voyage; and he was attended by a good number of the English nobility. After having reposed himself two days at Dort, he proceeded to Aix la Cha∣pelle, where he was crowned king of the Romans by Conrad, archbishop of Cologne, as the elector of Mentz, whose right it was to perform this cere∣mony, at that time lay under the sentence of excommunication. The coro∣nation and knighthood of his eldest son Henry were solemnized with such magnificence as could not but be agreeable to the mercenary Germans, who nevertheless insisted upon his sending home all the English noblemen, tho' they had intended to stay a whole year abroad; and having in less than<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

Mean while the slight incursions of the Welsh increased to a regular war, main∣tained against the English by prince Llewellyn. Geffrey de Langley, go∣vernor of the country between Cheshire and the river of Conway, which had been ceded to Henry at the last pacification, attempted to introduce the Eng∣lish laws, and courts of judicature, among the inhabitants of that district. The Welsh, who are extremely bigotted to their own customs, took the alarm; and, as the peace had been already violated on both sides by mutual depredations, Llewellyn assembled a strong body of horse and foot, with which he obtained several advantages over the wardens of the English marches; he over-ran that part of Wales which was under the protection of Henry, and at length invested the castle of Gannock, which was built for the defence of that territory. The king had hitherto winked at his progress, which indeed he could not conveniently stop; but, now alarmed by the prospect of losing the only conquest he had ever made, he summoned his barons, and military at∣tendants of the north, to attend him at Chester, and appointed a rendezvous at Bristol for the western counties, resolving to divide the forces of the enemy, by attacking them at once in different quarters: at the same time, he ordered a body of troops from Ireland to land upon the isle of Anglesey, which supplied the Welsh with the best part of their provisions. These precautions being taken, he entered North Wales with his army, and advancing to Gannock, remained inactive till Michaelmas, in expectation of the Irish forces, which never arrived; while the western division, ordered to make a diversion in South Wales, delayed executing their orders, pretending they could not act in the absence of their general, Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, who was suspected of holding a correspondence with Llewellyn: so that Henry was obliged to return, after<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr.

The clergy groaned under these intolerable impositions: the people, driven to despair by poverty and distress, clamoured aloud against that eternal spunge, which sucked up the whole wealth of the nation; and the nobility not only resented the inso∣lence, avarice, and tyranny, of the pope, but were exasperated at the weak∣ness and partiality of the king, who had conferred upon foreigners the first offices of the kingdom, which they, and they only, had a right to enjoy. They had endeavoured to reform Henry's conduct by repeated remonstrances, and even restricted him by the most solemn oaths, which he broke without the least hesitation; and now a spirit of discontent having diffused itself through all ranks and degrees of people, they resolved to procure redress of their grie∣vances in a more effectual manner than they had hitherto attempted.

<P>HENRY soon furnished the barons with an opportunity to execute their design; for he convoked a parliament; and, according to custom, demanded a powerful supply to carry on the conquest of Sicily. He could not have touched them upon a more discordant string. They had been so harrassed and exhausted by this ridiculcus scheme, that they could not hear it mentioned without being filled with indignation. Instead of complying with his demand, they bitterly complained of his breach of promise; and re∣monstrated in the strongest terms against all the abuses of his government. In vain he endeavoured to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole them by an affectation of candour and sincerity, confessing his indiscretion, and vowing a reformation in his conduct. This expedient had lost its effect. They told him plainly they would not depend upon his word; and therefore were resolved to rectify the abuses of his reign in such a manner, that they should have nothing to fear for the future from his inconstancy. Terrified at this declaration, he promised to concur with them in every step that could be taken for the advantage of the nation; and
<PB REF="5280"/>
even granted a writing, subscribed with his own hand, by which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the nomination of four and twenty noblemen, chosen by himself and the parliament, to draw up the articles of reformation, to which he would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> submit; and, as a farther proof of his sincerity, he ordered his son Edward to sign this obligation. Henry's behaviour on this occasion was the immediate effect of personal fear; for, he perceived a strong confederacy was formed against him by the most powerful nobility of the realm, such as Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, high steward of England, Humphrey de Bohun high constable, Roger Bigod earl mareschal, and Richard de Clare earl of Gloucester, some of whom were governed by private animosity against the king's person and favourites; and others, instigated by ambition or self-interest, to retrench the prerogative of the crown. On the third day of the session they appeared in the parliament-house, clad in armour; a sight at which the king was so much startled, that he asked if he was a prisoner. To this interrogation Roger Bigod answered, that he was not a prisoner; but they were determined to expel all the Poitevins, and other foreigners, from England, and rectify the disorders of the state. It was this appearance and declaration that induced him to comply with their proposal, the execution of which was deferred till the next meeting, which he appointed at Oxford. During this interval, the ba∣rons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Rymer.</NOTE> knowing how little they could depend upon his most solemn protestations, levied a body of forces; and, at the time prescribed, repaired to Oxford, well armed and attended, and firmly resolved to execute their design. The first business of the session was to choose the council of four and twenty; and Simon de Montfort was at the head of the twelve whom the barons elected. These commissioners began to deliberate immediately upon the subject of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1258.</NOTE> meeting; and in a little time they agreed to the following articles. That the king should confirm the great charter which he had so often sworn to observe; that the office of high justiciary should be conferred upon a person of talents and integrity, who should administer justice to the poor and rich, without dis∣tinction; that the chancellor, treasurer, judges, and other ministers of the public, should be chosen annually by the council of four and twenty; and that the parliament should be assembled once at least in three years, to enact laws for the benefit of the kingdom. The parliament having approved of these ar∣ticles, which were known by the appellation of the Statutes of Oxford, they were confirmed by the assent of the king and prince Edward, who solemnly swore to observe, and cause them to be observed, to the utmost of his power <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Those that constituted the king's council were Fulk Basset bishop of London, Aymer de Valence elect of Westminster, Henry, son of Richard king of the Romans, Guy de Luzignan, William de Valence, John earl of Warrenne, John earl of Warwick, John Mansel justiciary, J. de Derlington abbot of Westminster, and Henry de Wingham chancellor. Those nominated by the barons were Walter de Canteloupe bishop of Worcester; the earls of Leicester, Hereford, Glou∣cester, and Mareschal, Roger Mortimer, John Fitzgeffrey, Hugh Bigod brother to the earl Mareschal, Richard de Grey, W.

<P>Nevertheless they were not constituted without opposition: the earl of Warrenne refused to sign articles so derogatory to the king's prerogative; and Henry, son of Richard king of the Romans, protested against them or any other such regulation as should be made in the absence of his father. The earl of Leicester, still insolent and impetuous, gave him to understand, that should
<PB N="520" REF="5290"/>
his father refuse to concur with the barons in such salutary measures, he should not preserve one foot of land in England. But the most industrious oppo∣sers of the statutes were the king's uterine brothers, against whose influ∣ence these regulations were chiefly levelled. William de Valence having de∣clared that he would never consent to such restrictions as tended to diminish the king's honour and authority; Leicester threatened him with a resumption of the lands and castles he enjoyed by grants from the crown; and when he answered that he knew how to defend his own property, Simon told him his head should pay for his disobedience. William and his brother Aymer, elect of Winchester, supposing from this declaration that a design was formed against their lives, privately withdrew to the sea-side, in hope of escaping to the con∣tinent; but, as they could not find a vessel for their purpose, they took re∣fuge in the castle of Wolvesham, belonging to the see of Winchester. The barons were no sooner apprized of their flight, than they took horse and pursued them to that city, where without any formal adjournment they re∣sumed their deliberations and finished the session of parliament. As they could not, without violation of the privileges of the church, attack the castle to which the four brothers had retired, they had recourse to a negotiation, pro∣posing they should quit the kingdom, and stay abroad until the state should be reformed, when the king might with the consent of his council permit them to return. Henry interposing in their behalf, and offering security for their continuing quiet, without attempting to oppose the articles of reformation, they agreed that Guy and Geffrey should go into exile; and that the other two might remain in the kingdom, under such custody as the barons should appoint, until the pacification of the troubles. William and Aymer did not much relish the scheme of confinement, but chose to go abroad with their brothers, even though their estates should be sequestred by the barons, who allowed them a certain proportion for their subsistence, and promised the rest should be payed at their return. The particulars of this agreement being adjusted, they were supplied with a safe conduct; and after having been stripped of about seven thousand marks in ready money, embarked at Dover for the continent. Sums of money which they had deposited in divers religious houses, were seized and sequestred, their lands confiscated, agents sent to Rome with letters to the pope, desining his holiness to deprive Aymer of the administration of Win∣chester;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The barons, having thus expelled the foreigners that were so odious to the nation, associated themselves by a solemn oath to maintain the Statutes of Oxford, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; and they invited the citi∣zens of London to join their association: a proposal which was readily embraced by the Londoners, who had always been at variance with Henry. They appointed a committee of fourpersons to supply vacancies in the king's council, by virtue of one of the articles, which provided that if any of the twelve barons should be absent, the rest might fill up their places. Under this pretext they constituted a council of their own party; and the king being intirely in their hands, ma∣naged the affairs of the realm according to their own pleasure. They exacted oaths from the people that they would observe their regulations; and resolved that all who should oppose or neglect their ordinances should be treated as ene∣mies of the public. In a word, they were intoxicated with power, and became
<PB N="521" REF="5300"/>
tyrants in their turn. They bestowed offices on their friends and relations, reduced the king's authority to a meer shadow, and even assembled parliaments without his consent or knowledge. In one of these they proceeded judicially against the foreigners whom they had expelled, and by an authentic act con∣demned them to perpetual banishment; then they sent deputies to the pope to justify their proceedings, giving his holiness to understand that they could not comply with his desires touching the conquest of Sicily, because the king had em∣barked in that enterprize, without consulting his parliament or considering the state of the kingdom, which could by no means support the expence of such an expedition; besides, the conditions of the donation were too hard and im∣practicable: nevertheless if his holiness would mitigate the terms of his pro∣posal, they would prosecute the project with all their power. They communi∣cated the Statutes of Oxford as expedients to which they had been reduced by the weakness and incapacity of the king, who was entirely governed by the counsels of foreigners, who had no tie to bind them down to the interest of the nation; and they mentioned the bishop elect of Winehester as the chief author of all the mischiefs with which the kingdom had been afflicted. They repre∣sented that prelate as guilty of enormous crimes, in the consciousness of which he had desired to quit England, left he should be called to ac∣count for his male practices; they accused him of having advised the king to violate his oath and promise: so that they looked upon him as an enemy to the kingdom, from which they had driven him into perpetual ba∣nishment. The pope, far from being satisfied with this justification, was in∣censed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> at their presumption, in renouncing the favourite scheme from which he had derived such advantages: but perceiving they were at present too proud and elevated to brook reproof or menaces, he delayed answering their remon∣strance; and in the mean time, encouraged Henry in private with assurances of protection. Yet he still pressed him to pay the arrears due to the Italian mer∣chants, and fixed a time for the discharge of that obligation, at the expiration of which he sent orders to the bishop of London to excommunicate all the debtors of those merchants, without distinction of rank or circumstance. This order, however, unsupported by the royal authority, was never put in execution; and the conquest of Sicily was considered as a dangerous and chi∣merical project, tending to the ruin of England. So little was Henry able to execute that design, that he now saw himself despoiled of all his regal power, at the mercy of the barons, who compelled him to sign orders every day to the prejudice and even ruin of his prerogative. Of all those noblemen, he whom he hated most was Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, his own bro∣ther-in-law: he had never forgot or forgiven the insult he received from that nobleman in parliament; and he looked upon him as the chief author of his present misfortune. The dangerous situation to which he was reduced could not hinder him from manifesting his sentiments on this subject; one day in going by water to the Tower, he was surprized with a sudden storm of wind accompanied with thunder and lightening, and ordered his people to row him ashore immediately. The nearest landing-place was at Durham stairs, where he was received by the earl of Leicester, who seeing him in great perturbation, asked if he was afraid of the thunder and lightening. To which interrogation Henry replied, "I am afraid of the storm; but, by God's head! I am more afraid of thee than of all the thunder and lightening in the universe."</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Incensed at this mortifying message, he told the deputies that he wondered at the presumption of the barons, who had attempted to change the government without his consent.

The governors being apprized of his intention, equipped a fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and army to dispute his landing; and as he was in no condition to cope with such powerful adversaries he agreed to their proposal.

<P>During Henry's absence, the four and twenty governors of England, applied an effectual remedy to an abuse of the court of Rome, against which the nation had long clamoured. All the best benefices of the kingdom were in the hands of Italian ecclesiastics, who, without residing on the spot, farmed their livings to the best bidders, and the money was remitted to Italy; so that there was hardly any specie left in the island. In order to redress this grievance, the governors published a proclamation, ordering all persons who farmed be∣nefices belonging to foreigners, to deposit the rents in the hands of certain receivers appointed for the purpose, on pain of seeing their houses razed to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1260.</NOTE> foundation. Although the barons had hitherto acted with unanimity, many of them now began to take umbrage at the great authority engrossed by the earl of Leicester, who in a manner erected himself into the sovereign of the four and twenty; and the earl of Gloucester endeavoured to form a party, in order to counterballance his interest and be a check upon his ambition. He first of all depr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciated his conduct in private; and insinuated that he had entered into a league with prince Edward, whom he intended to raise to the throne even in the lifetime of his father. This report reaching the ears of Henry, who was then at St. Omer, he was so a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>righted at the intimation, that he could not resolve upon his return to England, left his liberty or his life should be in danger; unt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Edward being informed of his suspicions, cleared himself of the imputa∣tion in such a man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, as left no d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubts in the breast of his father. Gloucester,
<PB N="523" REF="5320"/>
disappointed in this quarter, attacked Leicester openly, charging him with divers malversations in Guienne as well as in England; and demanded that a day might be appointed to examine the articles of impeachment: the time was accordingly fixed, and the earl of Leicester appeared in his own defence; when his ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>user, either conscious of his own want of evidence, or dreading the power of the culprit, desired the trial might be deferred, because some of his witnesses were absent. This quarrel might have produced mischievous conse∣quences, had not the king of the Romans undertaken to terminate the dispute, as well as to pacify his nephew prince Edward, who was extremely incensed against the earl of Gloucester. Having succeeded in effecting this reconcilia∣tion, he set out for Germany, whither he was invited by a deputation from the princes, assuring him that he should now receive the imperial crown without opposition; and he was accompanied by prince Edward, whose presence on the continent was necessary to regulate the affairs of Gascony, and settle all dif∣ferences<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Richard found the German nobility more than ever divided into factions; and foreseeing that it would be impossible to succeed without dissipating immense sums of money, which he could not afford to expend, he relinquished his design and returned to England. There he found the king and queen of Scotland, who had come to visit Henry; and after some stay in his court at Westminster, Alexander went back to his own kingdom; but, his queen remaining with her father, was delivered at Windsor of a daughter named Margaret. At the same time arrived John de Dreux, duke of Brit∣tany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Mailro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> with intention to marry Beatrix the king's second daughter; and the court was extremely splendid; for, though the governors had very little res∣pect for the person of Henry, they, for the credit of the nation, received those illustrious strangers with great magnificence and hospitality. This, however, was but small consolation to Henry, who could not even dispose of his own revenues; or plead any merit from the reception that was given to his own sons-in-law. Careless and indolent as he was, he could not but feel and resent these mortifications; but, as there was no body near his person to whom he could communicate his chagrin, or by whose counsel he could hope to extri∣cate himself from such restrictions, he privately invited his brother Aymer, bishop of Winchester, to return to England, hoping that his own character and the protection of the pope, who had by this time confirmed his election, would secure him from the persecution of the barons. That prelate had ac∣cepted the invitation, and actually set out from Rome for England, where his presence would have infallibly produced fresh troubles, had not death intercepted him at Paris, to the unspeakable joy of the barons, who could not have re∣fused him entrance into the kingdom, without coming to an open rupture with the pope, which it was their interest to avoid. Notwithstanding this disappoint∣ment, the king persisted in his design to free himself from the yoke of the four and twenty. He hoped to draw some advantage from the quarrel between the earls of Leicester and Gloucester, which he knew was but externally accommo∣dated; and he desired the pope would absolve him from the oath he had taken to observe the Statutes of Oxford. That request was readily granted by the pontiff, whose interest was concerned as well as that of Henry, in effecting a change of government; but, Alexander dying before the dispensation could be

<P>His scruples being thus removed, he resolved to pull off the mask without delay; and, in the mean time, endeavoured to gain over to his interest some of those whom the governors had appointed to exercise offices of trust in the nation. Having partly succeeded in these attempts, he, without communi∣cating his intention to any person whatever, appeared unexpectedly in the par∣liament which was assembled at London, and declared, to the unspeakable astonishment of the members, that they had promised to pay his debts and augment his revenue, when he signed the Statutes of Oxford; but, as they had not performed their promise, he did not think himself obliged to keep the oath he had there taken; that he would no longer make use of the counsellors who had been imposed upon him, but was determined to free himself from<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1261.</NOTE> such inglorious bonds, and assert the dignity of his prerogative. So saying he retired to the Tower, which he had previously secured for his purpose, seized all the money in the mint, published a proclamation discarding the officers ap∣pointed by the four and twenty, and nominating others in their room; and acted with such vigour, as seemed to be the effect of a steady resolution to re∣trieve<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris.</NOTE> his independence. Prince Edward, who was then at Paris, being in∣formed of this transaction, and apprehensive of mischievous consequences, re∣turned to England immediately, in order to employ all his interest and endea∣vours for preventing a civil war; and his arrival was expected with impatience by the barons, who hoped to convince him of his father's misconduct, and en∣gage him as a mediator at least, to compromise the quarrel which they were not in a condition to maintain. Henry wished for his return with the same eagerness, in full expectation of his adding strength and importance to the royal cause; but he was extremely confounded, when he understood that Edward loadly blamed him for the violation of his oath; and his confusion was re∣doubted by the reunion of the earls of Leicester and Gloucester, who now agreed to an hearty reconciliation, as the only expedient that could prevent the ruin of both, and swore a second time to the Statutes of Oxford. The party of the barons being thus fortified, they gave the king to understand, that unless he would voluntarily remove from his person those evil counsellors, who had given him such pernicious advice, they would find means to effect that removal by compulsion. Henry, who had rashly embarked in this enterprize during a gust of passion, had by this time relapsed into his native perplexity and irre∣solution; and, as he could not determine upon what answer he ought to make, he took no notice of the message, but remained in the Tower, from an appre∣hension that his person would not be safe in any other habitation. His fears, however, waxing stronger and stronger every day, he lived in the utmost ter∣ror, and with a view to encrease the number of his partisans published the pope's bull, which absolved him from the obligation of his oath; an impru∣dent step, by which he forfeited all the regard of the nation, and furnished his enemies with a plausible pretence for representing him as a person, upon whose faith and sincerity no dependence could be placed. The barons, who had hitherto hoped to accommodate matters before they should come to an open rupture, now laid aside all restraint, and contrived a scheme for surprizing him at Winchester, to which city he had lately repaired on the faith of a ne∣gotiation;
<PB N="525" REF="5340"/>
but, being apprised of their design, he withdrew again to the Tower, from whence he sent orders into all the counties to change the magi∣strates appointed by the four and twenty; and these directions filled the whole kingdom with confusion. The barons began to take effectual measures for op∣posing the king's designs, and engaged the governors of the Cinque-Ports to equip a fleet of ships to succour the coast, and prevent his being strengthened by foreign reinforcements.</P>

<P>Every thing seemed to portend an immediate civil war, though both parties were afraid to plunge the nation into such a gulf of calamity, and each industriously sought to fix the odium of this dissention upon the other. At length the king of the Romans offered his mediation, which being accepted, he prevailed upon his brother to declare he would confirm the Statutes of Ox∣ford, and at the same time, persuaded the barons to relax in those articles which were the most disagreeable to Henry. Not that they unanimously agreed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1262.</NOTE> to this qualification. The earl of Leicester protested against the peace, alled∣ging that they could never safely confide in the professed sincerity of a prince who broke through the most sacred ties for his convenience; and having made this declaration he retired to France. Several other barons expressed their dis∣like to the articles, but suffered themselves to be over-ruled by the majority, rather than run the risk of being reproached as the authors of intestine commo∣tion; and by this treaty, the tranquility of England seemed to be happily re∣established: yet, under this appearance of peace, the embers of discord still glowed, so as in a little time to burst out into a flame, that reged with un∣common violence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the ratification of this agreement, Richard, king of the Ro∣mans, re-visited Germany, upon a pressing invitation of the princes, who sup∣posed he had, by this time, recruited his finances, and was in a condition to feed their venality. Henry himself took this opportunity of the pacification, to go in person and regulate the affairs of Guienne, and was seized with a dan∣gerous distemper at Bourdeaux, which detained him on the continent much longer than he had proposed to stay, when he departed from England. Ri∣chard, earl of Gloucester, dying in the mean time, his son Gilbert made a voyage to Guienne to receive the investiture of the earldom; but Henry was so irritated against Richard, that the son was obliged to undergo the trouble of a tedious sollicitation, and even present him with a considerable sum of money, before he could obtain his request. During the king's absence, the friends of Leicester, whose turbulence and ambition no concessions could appease or sa∣tisfy, renewed their cabals, and endeavoured to re-unite the party which had been divided by the last accommodation. This talk was the less difficult, as Gloucester's death delivered him from the opposition of a powerful rival, and as the king had furnished them with a plausible pretext, for complaining that he had not yet confirmed the Statutes of Oxford. The earl no sooner under∣stood that his emissaries had set the party in motion, than he returned to Eng∣land, where his presence revived the courage and animosity of all those who had subscribed the articles contrary to their own inclination; and the king re∣ceiving intelligence of their measures embarked for England immediately, in order to anticipate their designs: but before his arrival, the barons had con∣certed a plan for securing themselves from all the bad effects of his inconstancy.

From this expedition he returned to London; and being destitute of money to pay his forces, he marched at the head of a strong detachment to the house of the Templars, from whence he carried off ten thousand pounds sterling belong∣ing to the citizens, who had there deposited it as in a place of safety. This act <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> violence and rapine produced an universal clamour among the inhabitants: but their complaints were disregarded by the prince, who ordered the money to be secured in the castle of Windsor, which they did not think proper to besiege. Pope Urban, considering England as an exhausted fund, from which he could drain no more money, resolved to play the same game with France, touching the crown of Sicily, and actually entered into a negotiation with Charles, count of Anjou, brother to the French king, a nobleman w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om he proposed to elevate to the Sicilian throne.

<P>Overtures of accommodation had been made by the moderate part of the nation, to prevent the quarrel between the king and the malecontents from proceeding to extremities; but their endeavours proving ineffectual, from the obstinacy of both parties, who shifted the blame from each other, the earl of Leicester fearing that those delays served only to debauch his partisans, resolved to engage them beyond a power of retracting, by commencing hostilities with∣out further hesitation. What quickened his resolution was the industry of the king's party, who had exacted an oath of fealty to his son Edward from all the citizens of London; and, in a parliament held at Westminster, all the nobility had sworn to maintain the succession, except Gilbert de Clare, earl of Glou∣cester, who was a professed adherent of Leicester, and refused to take the oath in the face of the parliament. Henry, alarmed at this refusal, began to dread an insurrection, and issued out writs to all the sheriffs, enjoining them to de∣mand
<PB N="527" REF="5360"/>
an oath from all persons at their county courts, implying that they would stand by the king with their lives and fortunes, and after his death sup∣port his son Edward in his succession to the throne of his father. The prince had repaired in person to the isle of Shepey, where he convened the barons of the Cinque-Ports, who subjected themselves to the same oath at his desire; though these obligations were not at all binding on either side; for as the pope had more than once absolved the king of oaths which he pretended to have taken on compulsion, so now the inferior clergy, who were unanimously in the interest of the barons, removed the scruples o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the people, and exhorted them to join in the defence of their liberties, against the tyranny of a king ruled by insolent and rapacious foreigners.</P>

<P>The commonalty were thus inflamed to a degree of enthusiasm, while Leicester seeing them ripe for his purpose, convoked his barons at Ox∣ford, where they resolved to maintain the statutes by force of arms, and chose the earl for their general. They had already levied some troops, which were now assembled, and augmented to a prodigious number. Peter, bishop of Hereford, a native of Burgundy, who had rendered himself odious to the clergy by oppressing them in the Sicilian affair, was now the first who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt the rese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment of the revolters; they seized and imprisoned him in Erdesley castle, plundered his effects, and destroyed his farms. The Italian ecclesiastics were pillaged and turned out of their livings: Geoffrey de Langley, Roger de Mortimer, and all the other noblemen who had opposed the power of the four and twenty, saw their lands and houses cruelly ravaged; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury of the commons was in an especial manner levelled against Simon de Walton, bi∣shop of Norwich, and John Mansel justiciary, who had executed the pope's bulls for absolving the nation from the oath to observe the provisions of Ox∣ford. The earl of Leicester, having made himself master of Gloucester, Worcester, and Bridgnorth, advanced about Midsummer towards London, with the royal standard, carried before him, and subduing all the king's castles in his way, provided them with garrisons and governors devoted to his in∣terest. Henry at this time resided in the Tower; prince Edward lodged at Clerkenwell, destitute of friends and money; and the city of London had de∣clared for the barons, under the influence of Thomas Fitz-Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mas the may<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, a staunch adherent to Leicester. The populace formed themselves into associa∣tions against all foreigners, whom they persecuted with the utmost cruelty and malice; and prince Edward retired with his French knights to Windsor, where he endeavoured to assemble a body of forces, with which he might be able to take the field against the barons. The queen thinking herself unsafe from the fury of the multitude, resolved to follow her son by water, and ac∣cordingly went on board of a barge at the Tower; but as she approached Lon∣don-bridge, she was insulted in the most brutal manner by the populace, who, not contented with reviling her in the most reproachful terms, endeavoured to sink her boat and destroy her li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, by throwing a prodigious quantity of stones into the vessel when the rowers attempted to pass through one of the arches; so that she was obliged to return to the Tower, which she reached with great danger and difficulty, and was from thence conveyed to the palace of the bishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Mean while Leicester visited the Cinque-Ports, which he confirmed in his interest; and then advancing with his army towards London, the king, in terror of being besieged, agreed to the articles which the revolters pleased to propose; and the treaty was con∣cluded, on condition that the strong places of the kingdom should be put into the hands of the barons; that the Statutes of Oxford should be inviolably ob∣served; that all foreigners should be banished the kingdom, except such as might be permitted to stay by the unanimous consent of the barons; and that none but natural-born subjects, approved by the barons, should be concerned in the administration of public affairs.</P>

<P>This peace, which was proclaimed in London on the twenty-se∣cond day of July, was very disagreeable to prince Edward, who could not bear to see the royal prerogative laid under such restrictions. He had repaired to Bristol, with a view to provide the castle of that place with a good garrison and other necessaries for a vigorous defence, in case the negotiation should not succeed; and he ordered the inhabitants to furnish all the necessary stores and provision at their own expence. The minds of the people being already irri∣tated against his father, they were so incensed at this arbitrary demand that a sedition ensued; and Edward was fain to take refuge in the castle, where he was immediately invested. Unprovided as he was with men and ammunition, he had recourse to a stratagem, by which he delivered himself from the fury of the enraged populace. He desired to speak with the bishop of Worcester, to whom he declared his intention was to espouse the party of the barons; but that he wanted first to try whether or not he could persuade his father to grant them satisfaction without coming to extremities. He therefore proposed that the bishop should interpose his influence with the populace, that he might have liberty to go and execute his design; and he desired the bishop would accom∣pany him in such a laudable undertaking, to direct him with his advice, and be an eye-witness of his conduct. The prelate, satisfied with this declaration, represented to the citizens, that it was of the greatest detriment to the common∣weal, to detain the prince at such a juncture: the blockade was immediately raised; and Edward set out for London, accompanied by the unsuspecting bishop. When they arrived at Egham, the prince clapped spurs to his horse, and rode full speed to the castle of Windsor, in which he thought himself secure; but the prelate, provoked at his escape and equivocation, proceeded to London, and complained of his behaviour to the barons, who resolved to besiege him immediately. Edward, knowing the place was not provided for a regular siege, was no sooner apprized of their march, than he rode forth to meet the earl of Leicester, in hope of amusing him with a negotiation, by which he might be allowed to keep possession of the castle; and he had a conference at Kingston with that nobleman, who did not chuse to grant the conditions upon which he insisted: he ther fore attempted to return, but found himself
<PB N="529" REF="5380"/>
arrested, and obliged to accept of such terms as the earl was pleased to pro∣pose. The castle was delivered into the hands of the barons; the garrison, consisting wholly of foreign troops, was conducted to the sea-side and em∣barked for their own country, after their equipage had been shamefully plun∣dered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron.

<P>Mean while the king, at the publication of the peace, had quitted the Tower, and repaired to his palace at Westminster, where he inwardly repined at the triumph of the barons, who did not use their success with moderation. Hugh D' Espenser was created justiciary; the seals were given to Nicholas de Ely, while the earl of Leicester, at the head of his army, committed outrages with impunity, and in effect governed all England. His pride and insolence had raised him a number of enemies among the nobility, and now the people loudly murmured against the rapine and oppression which his soldiers exercised under his cognizance. They complained to the king, who could not redress their grievances; though, in order to prevent their taking arms in their own defence, they were amused with hopes of receiving satisfaction from the next parliament, which met in September. During this short session, the charter for confirming the Oxford provisions was read in St. Paul's church; guardians of the peace were appointed all over the kingdom; a resolution was taken to administer justice with punctuality for the future; and as Leicester refused to make restitution, the case of the sufferers was referred to the consideration of the ensuing parliament. Lewis, king of France, with a view to reconcile Henry and his barons, summoned this prince, together with the earl of Lei∣cester and other noblemen who enjoyed estates in his dominions, to meet him in the assembly of the estates at Boulogne, to deliberate on the coronation of his son, and an expedition to Palestine, in which he proposed to embark. The barons would not consent to the king's departure until he had promised in wri∣ting, and upon the oath of Sir Geffrey Gatelin, that he would return within a week after Michaelmas. Then committing the government to the charge of Hugh D' Espenser, he took shipping at Dover, with the queen, the two princes, and a great number of the nobility, and arrived in safety at Boulogne, where Lewis endeavoured to persuade the barons to desist from their encroach∣ments upon the prerogative, which had produced so much disturbance in their country, and seemed so subversive of all order and subordination. But Leicester, elated with his power and success, rejected all proposals of submission and returned abruptly to England. He was in a little time followed by Henry, who left his queen in France, that she might not be exposed to such insults as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. St. Aug.

<P>When the parliament met at Westminster, the earl appeared with a strong body of Londoners; and as the original four and twenty governors were by this time partly dead, and partly converted to the king's interest, he resolved to supply their places with those who adhered to the party of the ba∣rons: but the people, whom he had disobliged by his arrogance and tyranny, joining with Henry's friends, formed a strong opposition to his measures; and disputes ran high in parliament, when prince Edward, on pretence of visiting his wife, surprised Windsor, to which the king next day retired, attended by several earls and barons, who had promised to stand by him with their lives and for∣tunes. Henry called another parliament at Reading, where it could not be

Leicester and his barons refused to go thither; and the king, assembling a body of forces, marched directly to Do∣ver, and tried to surprize the castle; but he miscarried in the attempt, through the vigilance o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Richard de Grey, the governor, who was a partisan of the earl of Leicester. This recommencement of hostil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties furnished the malecontents with an handle to depreciate the character of Henry, whom they represented as a person bound by no ties of agreement or accommodation; and they accused him of a design to introduce foreign troops to enslave the subjects of England. In order to obviate the effects of this imputation, the king issued a writ, to the citizens of London, and afterwards to all the sheriffs of England, declaring t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he neither had nor would invite foreigners into the realm; charging the people to refuse payment of any illegal taxes that might be laid upon them by t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rebellious barons, and forbidding them to march out of their counties with∣out his special mandate: he likewise ordered the inhabitants of London to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> remove the earl of Leicester and his followers from the city, where they had fixed their head-quarters.</P>

<P>Mean while, being baffled in his expectation at Dover, he visited the Cinque-Ports; and having obliged the barons to renew their oath of fealty, advanced with his army towards London, where he still had a good number of adherents, though the majority of the common people were in the interest of the barons. Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester, hearing of his approach, took post in Southwark to oppose his entrance into the capital; and the king in his march was joined by prince Edward from Windsor with a strong body of forces; so that he was now greatly superior in number to his adversaries. He resolved therefore to attack Leicester in his quarters; and his friends in London undertook to pre∣vent that nobleman's retreat into the city. They accordingly locked up the bridge gates, and threw the keys into the river, while the royal army proceeded to the assault. The earl, finding himself precluded, was obliged to stand upon the defensive and maintain the engagement, until the populace, being informed of his situation, broke down the gates and barricadoes, and poured in vast num∣bers to his assistance; so that the king and prince Edward were fain to re∣treat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

The faction produced other overtures for an accommodation, and a truce was concluded, during which both parties agreed to refer their difference to the arbitration of the French king; and the reference was confirmed by the oaths of the king, barons, and all the principal persons concerned in the quarrel. Henry himself, with prince Ed∣ward and several members of his council, set out immediately for France, and were followed by the chiefs of the other party, except the earl of Leicester, who was prevented from going abroad on this occasion by a fall from his horse, in which his thigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bone was fractured.

The barons considered this salvo as a manifest contradiction, affirming that the
<PB N="531" REF="5400"/>

<P>The king was scarce returned from France, when Leicester sent his two sons Henry and Simon de Montfort with a strong body of forces to ra∣vage the lands of Roger de Mortimer; and afterwards being joined by Lle∣wellyn, they reduced the castle of Radnor: another party, commanded by Ro∣bert Ferrers, earl of Derby, advanced to Worcester; and after several assaults taking the city, abandoned it to plunder. Edward, marching to the relief of Mortimer, subdued several castles belonging to Humphry de Bohun, and pursued the two Montforts to Gloucester, where they sued for a truce, which they obtained by the mediation of the bishop of Worcester; before the expi∣ration of which another treaty was brought upon the carpet at Brackley, in pre∣sence of John de Valence, the French ambassador: but the parties could not agree upon the articles. The strength of the barons lay in the middle of Eng∣land, where the earls of Leicester and Derby possessed great estates; besides the city of London and the adjacent counties, which were greatly influenced by the earl of Gloucester. The king's interest prevailed in the north, in the Marches of Wales, and in the West, which was generally attached to the king of the Romans. As for London, it was still governed by Thomas Fitz-Thomas, whom the populace elected from one year to another, contrary to all former precedents. It was under his auspices that the citizens formed an association to maintain their liberties against the arbitrary measures of the king, and sup∣port to the utmost of their power the interest of the confederated barons. All the people in the city, above twelve years of age, swore to observe this asso∣ciation, which was signed by the mayor and commons of London on one part, and by the earls of Leicester, Gloucester, and Derby, Hugh le D' Espenser, the chief justiciary, and fourteen barons on the other; and in a little time the barons of the Cinque-Ports acceded to the same engagement. The populace were then divided into different bands; chose Thomas de Pievelesdon for their constable, created Stephen Bukerel their mareschal; and obliged themselves, on hearing the sound of the great bell in St. Paul's, to come forth armed by day or by night, to follow the banners of these chieftains. Under such conductors, they made incursions into the neighbourhood of London, pillaging and de∣stroying the houses and lands belonging to the king of the Romans and other noblemen of the king's party. In the week before Palm-Sunday, they broke open the houses and shops belonging to the Jews, plundered their effects, strip∣ped them stark naked, kept them in custody for some hours, and then massa∣cred above five hundred of that wretched people, under the immediate di∣rection of a powerful baron John Fitz-John, who with his own hand mur∣dered Koh Ben Abraham, the wealthiest Hebrew in England; and seizing all his treasure divided it between himself and the earl of Leicester. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>The conferences for the peace having broke up, and the commis∣sioners for the barons returned to London; the king summoned all his mili∣tary tenants to attend him at Oxford, and he was joined by a very considera∣ble body of forces from the north, commanded by John Comin, John Baliol lord of Galloway, Robert de Brus lord of Anandale, John de Vaux, Henry de Percy, and other noblemen from the Scottish border. With these he
<PB N="532" REF="5410"/>
marched to Northampton, where he understood a great number of barons had rendezvoused, in order to reinforce the earl of Leicester. Henry being refused admittance, broke down a weak part of the walls; and Simon dc Montfort sallying out, was taken prisoner by prince Edward, after his horse had fallen upon him. This accident disconcerted the associates in such a manner, that they threw down their arms, and submitted to the mercy of the king, who afterwards made himself ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of Leicester, Nottingham, Tutbury, and over∣run<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

The earl of Leicester had begun his march from London to join the forces rendezvoused at Northampton; but, hearing of their disaster, he retreated to the city, which he fortified with great diligence. Having taken this precaution, he resolved to besiege the castle of Rochester, in which the earl of Warenne commanded for the king, though the earl of Arundel and se∣veral other noblemen were in the place. When he advanced to Strode, he found the bridge over the river Medway broke down, and the other side de∣fended by a palisado and breastwork, well manned with the inhabitants, deter∣mined to oppose his passage: but, he filled a vessel with combustibles, and setting them on fire, passed the river under favour of the smoke. Having thus taken possession of the town, he invested the castle, which he would in all pro∣bability have reduced, had not the king, in order to make a diversion, ad∣vanced towards London. This motion alarmed the earl so much, that he re∣turned immediately to that city, leaving a small body of troops at Rochester, to block up the castle. These were easily defeated by the king, who now marched across the country to the relief of the earl of Warenne. After having gained this advantage, he took the castle of Tunbridge, and directing his route to Winchelsea, compelled some of the barons of the Cinque-Ports to renew their oath of homage, while the rest put to sea, and intercepted all supply of provision from abroad, except such as were intended for the use of the male∣contents. From Winchelsea the king marched into Sussex, and fixed his quarters in the convent of Lewes, while prince Edward took up his lodging in the castle.</P>

<P>Leicester being by this time reinforced by a body of fifteen thou∣sand Londoners, resolved to hazard a decisive engagement; and with that view, began his march towards the place where the king's army was encamped. He halted about two leagues from Lewes; and that he might throw the odium of whatever mischief should happen upon Henry, he sent a respectful message to the king, declaring that he and his followers had not taken up arms with a view to renounce their allegiance, but merely to remedy the disorders of the government; he therefore conjured his majesty to concur with them in that salutary work, protesting that he should find them as obedient as those syco∣phants, who, under the pretext of respectful service, sought his ruin, in at∣tempting, by their infamous calumnies, to alienate his affection from his faith∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> This remonstrance gave such offence to prince Edward, and the king o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Romans, that they answered it with reproach and defiance; which th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orted with interest, renouncing their allegiance, and branding the king <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as an enemy to the nation. Both sides now prepared for battle with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> utmost rancour of animosity; and the earl of Leicester advanced to the neighbourhood of Lewes, where he found Henry's troops ready to give
<PB N="533" REF="5420" MS="y"/>
him a warm reception. The royal army was formed in three divisions; prince Edward commanded on the right, the king of the Romans was posted in the left wing, and Henry himself remained in the centre. The barons were divided into four bodies: the first was conducted by Henry de Montfort, son of the ge∣neral; the earl of Gloucester commanded the second; Simon, earl of Leicester, was at the head of the third; and the fourth, consisting of Londoners, extended to the left, under the direction of Nicholas Seagrave. The battle was beg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by prince Edward, who attacked the London militia with such fury, that they could not sustain the charge, but gave way, and fled immediately with great precipitation. He was so transported with the desire of revenging the insult they had offered to his mother, that he pursued them four miles from the field of battle, making a terrible slaughter. While he made this imprudent use of his victory, the earls of Leicester and Gloucester obtained the same advantage over Henry and the king of the Romans: the left wing was almost wholly cut in pieces, the king of the Romans with John Comyn, Robert de Brus, and other noblemen, being taken prisoners; but the centre made a very gallant resistance, being animated by the example o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Philip Basset, who per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed miracles of valour, until he was overpowered with numbers, after having received four and twenty wounds: the king himself was slightly hurt and his horse killed under him, before he retired to the priory of Lewes, where he fell into the hands of the enemy. The royal army was totally routed when prince Edward returned from the pursuit; and his followers were struck with such consternation, that the earl of Warenne, W. de Valence, Guy de Lusignan, and Hugh Bigod, fled with seven hundred men to Pevensey, where they em∣barked for the continent. This defection disabled prince Edward from execu∣ting his first resolution, of falling upon the victors while they were yet dispersed in the pursuit and pillage; at the same time it enabled the earl of Leicester to reduce his forces into some order, in case he should be attacked. Perceiving, however, that they were unwilling to engage, he amused Edward with propo∣sals of accommodation, until he had sent some detachments to cut off his re∣treat; and the prince finding himself entangled in the snare, was fain to submit to whatever was proposed. The negotiation lasted but a few minutes; and the treaty was concluded on these conditions: The Statutes of Oxford shall be punctually observed, though under such qualifications as may be judged pro∣per by four bishops or barons appointed in parliament: If these four commis∣sioners cannot agree, they shall be referred to the arbitration of the count of Anjou, brother to the king of France, assisted by four French noblemen: And Edward himself, with his cousin Henry son to the king of the Romans, shall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>This convention, which was called the Mise of Lewes, being settled, orders subscribed by the king were sent to the governors of all the castles in which the barons who had been taken at Northampton were kept, to re∣lease the prisoners; and the garrison of Tunbridge was disbanded. The northern barons taken in the battle were dismissed to their own country; and indeed it was stipulated that the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oners on both sides should be set at liberty; nevertheless, Leicester detained the king of the Romans, with his son Ed∣mund, Philip Basset, and other prisoners of quality, and arrested all the no∣bility

As the chief aim of the barons in agreeing to the articles at Lewes was to secure the person of prince Edward, they never thought of executing the convention; on the contrary, they concerted a new plan of government, to be authorized by a parliament which they intended to assemble in the king's name about Whit∣suntide. This step, however, was attended with some difficulties. They did not chuse to summon any of the opposite party; and they foresaw that a parliament composed wholly of their own creatures, would be thought defi∣cient in point of legal authority. They therefore contrived a method to ren∣der it more general and authentic. They compelled the king to sign com∣missions, appointing in every county certain officers or magistrates, under the title of Conservators, for preserving the privileges of the people; and these being adherents of the barons, were invested with a very extensive authority. Then the king signed new writs to these conservators, commanding them to appoint four knights in every shire, to sit and represent it in the ensuing par∣liament; and from this aera most writers date the origin of that right which the commons have to sit in the great council of the nation, since the Norman conquest. The parliament, packed in this manner, of members entirely de∣voted to the barons, did not fail to approve the plan of government, which was projected to the following purpose: that the parliament should nominate three commissioners of undoubted sagacity and discretion, impowered to chuse a council of nine noblemen, to whose care the administration of pub∣lic affairs should be entrusted; and that these nine counsellors might be changed occasionally, with the consent of the king and the commissioners: that in case of disagreement in opinion among the three commissioners, touching the choice of the counsellors, the dispute should be determined by the majo∣rity: that the deliberations of the nine should be executed with the approbation of six of the number; but if that could not be procured, the affairs should be referred to the determination of the three great commissioners: that the king should have power to dismiss or change these commissioners, with the consent of the barons; and that the nomination of all public officers should be at the disposition of the nine counsellors: and these regulations should prevail until<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> altered or annulled by the parliament. The three commissioners were the earls of Leicester and Gloucester, and the bishop of Chichester; who con∣tinued to govern the kingdom upon this new model, after having extorted the approbation of the king and prince Edward, by threatening both with per∣petual imprisonment.</P>

<P>The queen, who resided in France, no sooner heard of the unsor∣tunate battle of Lewes, than she began to borrow a sum of money to raise forces and equip a fleet, for releasing her son and husband. An infinite num∣ber of sold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of fortune flocked from Germany, Burgundy, and other coun∣tries,

to Damme in Flanders, which was the place of rendezvous she had ap∣pointed; and at the same time the king of France was employed in setting on foot a mighty armament, which was supposed to be intended against the barons of England, who had so insolently rejected his award. Leicester, possessed with this notion, obliged Henry to write a letter to Lewis, desiring that prince would desist from his martial preparations, and interpose his good offices in effecting a solid peace between the crown and the barons. As the king of France paid very little regard to this address from a prince in actual im∣prisonment; king Henry repeated his remonstrance, intreating that he would not send or suffer any of his subjects to come over to England, lest such a step might be prejudicial to his son Edward, and to his nephew Henry, who were hostages in the power of the barons; and reinvolve the kingdom in bloodshed and confusion. As Lewis had, in a letter to Henry, pressed him to send over ambassadors to Boulogne, in order to discuss the reference to which both sides had agreed in the convention of Lewes, the king of England gave him to understand, that his chief counsellors were gone to take security from some lords of the Marches; but, if he would send a safe-conduct, his ambassadors should be at Boulogne about the middle of August.</P>

<P>The noblemen of the Welsh marches had declared openly against the proceedings of the last parliament; and Leicester had marched to that country, in order to suppress them entirely, or compromise matters in such a manner as would prevent domestic disturbances, while the nation was threatened with a foreign invasion. He accordingly reduced their castles, and ravaged their lands, until they were obliged to give hostages for keeping the peace; then he returned towards London to oppose the descent of the enemy. He had issued out writs in the king's name, summoning all the military te∣nants to appear in arms on the third day of August at London: he demanded a certain number of armed infantry from every hamlet, according to its size, while the cities and borroughs were required to provide horse as well as foot, with maintenance for forty days, at the common expence of the inhabitants. Writs were likewise issued to all the ports, cities, and towns, in Norfolk and Suffolk, to raise forces, and equip vessels, under the direction of Hugh le D' Espenser the new justiciary, who undertook to guard that part of the coast, while the earl of Leicester took charge of the fleet fitted out by the Cinque∣ports, to screen the southern parts from invasion. But the fears of a descent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. 48. Henry III.</NOTE> soon vanished, when the forces assembled at Damme by queen Eleanor, dis∣persed and retired for want of money; and it appeared that the king of France had never entertained the design of landing in Britain. But this was not the only apprehension that disturbed the barons in the enjoyment of their power. Cardinal Guido arrived at Boulogne, with orders from the pope to denounce ecclesiastical censures against the earls of Leicester, Gloucester, Norfolk, and their adherents, unless they would immediately abjure the Statutes of Oxford, restore the king to the full enjoyment of his royal prerogative, and set prince Edward and his cousin at liberty. The barons had forbid the legate to enter the kingdom, on pain of death; and he had in his turn published an admonition at Boulogne, requiring them to give him admittance before a certain day; otherwise he would excommunicate them nominally, and lay their lands under an interdict. Then they thought proper to amuse the cardinal, by sending

<P>Hitherto Leicester had proceeded with uninterrupted prosperity. He obliged Henry to confirm Thomas Fitz-Thomas in the mayoralty of Lon∣don, and resolved to reduce the lords of the Welsh marches, who were still averse to his administration, and had begun to take measures for reducing his exorbitant power. These were Roger de Mortimer, James Audeley, Roger de Leyburn, Hamon l'Estrange, Roger de Clifford, and Hugh de Truble∣ville, against whom he now marched, carrying the king along with him as a sanction to the undertaking. They had secured or broken down all the bridges on the Severne; so that he could not pass the river, until Llewellyn, his ally, made a diversion in his favour, by falling upon the lands of those noble∣men. Finding themselves thus hemmed in between two enemies, they were obliged to submit, and were pardoned on condition of delivering up their castles, together with the custody of their lands, to Simon earl of Leicester; who likewise received of prince Edward the castle and county palatine of Chester, which he committed to the care of his son Simon; and a peace be∣tween Wales and Cheshire was immediately concluded, at Hawarden.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1265.</NOTE> The barons, who had taken up arms against the king on account of his arbitrary government, could not but be jealous of Leicester, who reigned as absolutely as any tyrant upon earth. The earl of Gloucester, in particular, was jealous of his power, and resented the arrogance of his behaviour. He looked upon him as an ambitious adventurer, making large strides towards the throne, under the specious pretext of patriotism; and foresaw infinitely more mischief in the sway of such an usurper, than ever could be dreaded from the misconduct of a weak prince like Henry. He had already imprisoned the earl of Derby in the Tower, for some pretended misdemeanor; and be∣haved in such a cool indifferent manner to the earl of Gloucester, as seemed the prelude of some such design against that nobleman, who therefore began to take measures for his own defence. He favoured the malecontents on the Welsh marches, and employed all his influence in raising a faction to counter∣balance the power of Leicester. Simon perceived his drift, and issued a pro∣clamation commanding all those who had lately taken arms against the estab∣lished government, to retire into Ireland; but, instead of obeying this order, they repaired to the lands of the earl of Gloucester, who afforded them shelter and protection. Mean while the enemies of Leicester, insinuated on all oc∣casions,
<PB N="537" REF="5460"/>
that the cruelty with which he treated the king and his brother, with their sons, too plainly denoted the pernicious design which he harboured in his bosom; and these reports began to have such effect upon the minds of the nation, that he found it absolutely necessary to take some steps for his own exculpation. With this view, he convoked a parliment, on pretence to con∣cert measures for setting prince Edward at liberty; and at this assembly every shire was represented by two knights, and two burgesses appeared for every city and borough in the kingdom. When the parliament met at Westmin∣ster, Leicester accused Gloucester of having granted shelter and protection to the lords of the Welsh Marches, and demanded hostages for his fidelity; but the earl, instead of complying with his demand, quitted the place abrubtly, and retired to the west, with a strong body of his followers, among whom was John Giffard, one of the bravest noblemen in England, whom Leicester had attempted to oppress. As this parliament had been convoked chiefly on account of prince Edward, the bishops of London, Worcester, and Chichester, drew up a convention, containing the conditions of his release, and the king was obliged to swear to the performance. The prince parted with his palace at Westminster to Peter de Montfort; ceded his castle of Bristol to the earl of Leicester; and promised, in writing, to deliver all his castles in the Marches of Wales, for three years, to such persons as should be named by the king's council; to persuade or compel the noblemen of the Marches to submit to the present administration; to oppose the introduction of foreigners; to observe the agreement, on pain of forfeiting his estate; to give up the custody of all his castles for the term of five years; and to consent that his cousin Henry should be detained till the end of the year, as an hostage for his behaviour, in case the kingdom should be invaded. This convention being signed and ratified, Edward was brought into Westminster-Hall, where the instrument was read in public; and nine bishops joined in excommunicating all those who should presume to violate the agreement. Then the prince was declared free and at liberty, though like his father surrounded by a strong guard, which had particular orders to watch his motions; writs were issued for exacting a new oath of allegiance from all the people of England; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. Abingd. Ann. Trivet.

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>All those who were disgusted at the pride, insolence, tyranny, and extortion of Leicester, having now found a leader and patron in the earl of Gloucester, who was one of the most powerful and popular noblemen of his time, raised such a clamour against Simon, as seemed to portend a very dan∣gerous opposition. In order to avert this storm, he is said to have formed the design of taking away the life of his antagonist; and for this purpose, desired his son Henry de Montfort to proclaim a tournament at Northampton, to which all knights were invited without distinction. He knew the ambition and im∣petuosity of young Gloucester, who had, on a former occasion, expressed an eager desire of trying his dexterity and manhood against Henry; and he did not doubt but that the same eagerness subsisted, and would animate him to ap∣pear in the lists; in which case, it was supposed he would never have returned alive. Gloucester, well acquainted with the treacherous disposition of Mont∣fort, avoided the snare; and Leicester finding himself disappointed, prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="538" REF="5470"/>
upon the young knights and gentlemen assembled at the tournament, to proceed immediately to the Marches of Wales, in hope of taking Gloucester by sur∣prize: that nobleman, however, was upon his guard, had already fortified his casties, and engaged in a league with Mortimer and the other lords for their mutual security. Leicester arriving at Hereford, with the king and prince in his retinue, and perceiving his rival well prepared for his defence, proposed a treaty of accommodation, which was recommended to both parties by Henry, and managed by the bishop of Worcester and some other noblemen, whom Gloucester knew to be devoted to the interest of his adversary; he therefore had no intention to depend upon any politic reconciliation, and amused the managers with a negotiation, until the measures he had concerted with Morti∣mer were ripe for execution. He saw no way so effectual for humbling Lei∣cester, and preventing the dangerous consequences of his ambition, as that of effecting the escape of prince Edward, and supporting him with all his power and influence. He by means of his brother Thomas de Clare, who at∣tended Edward as a companion, communicated his resolution to that prince, who readily embraced the occasion of retrieving his liberty, and promised to act according to the directions he received. In pursuance of these, he one day rode forth in the afternoon to divert himself in Widmarsh near Hereford, ac∣companied by his usual guards and attendants, and made running matches be∣tween them until he had tired all their horses: in the evening the lord Croft appearing on the ascent of Tulington-Hill, and waving his bonnet according to agreement, the prince mounted a steed of incomparable fleetness, which he had reserved for the purpose, and bad adieu to his keepers, who pursued him for<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> some time, until they saw him received by Roger de Mortimer, with a party of men, who had concealed themselves in a neighbouring wood, and now con∣ducted him to the castle of Wigmore.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward's deliverance was no sooner known, than the lords of the Marches took to their arms, reduced all their own castles which they had formerly given up, and over-ran all the country from Hereford to Chester. The earl of Gloucester took the field with all the forces he could assemble, and broke down the bridges of the Severne, to prevent the excursions of Leicester. Great numbers flocked from all quarters to serve under the banners of prince Edward, who was joined by John Giffard, at the head of a surprising multitude of horse and foot, who followed the fortunes of that gallant chieftain; and he was reinforced by William de Valence, John earl of Warenne, and Hugh Bigod, who had a few days before landed at Pembroke, with a body of stout warriors enlisted upon the continent. Leicester was not a little confounded when he heard of Edward's escape; though at first he believed the prince had fled into Pembrokeshire, in order to take shipping for France; but he was soon undeceived to his sorrow, when Edward, at the head of a numerous army, ad∣vanced to Worcester, and found means to cut off his retreat into England. Montfort being thus caught in the snare he had laid for the earl of Gloucester, surrounded by enemies and at a great distance from London, which had hi∣therto supplied him with resources, summoned all the military tenants of the crown to meet the king at Gloucester with the utmost dispatch; but this order was ill obeyed, and before any body of militia appeared in his behalf, the city of Gloucester and the castle were taken by prince Edward. Then Leicester had recourse to his ally Llewellyn, prince of North Wales, who fell upon the lands
<PB N="539" REF="5480"/>
of the earl of Gloucester in Glamorgan, and sent a body of Welsh troops to join Montfort. Thus reinforced, he marched to Monmouth, whither he was fol∣lowed by John Giffard, who challenged him to battle: but he declined an en∣gagement and proceeded to Newport, where he expected to be supplied with ships from Bristol, according to the order he had sent to that city, that he might transport his army thither, as he could not otherwise pass the Severne. The earl of Gloucester, however, blocking up the mouth of the Avon with a fleet of gallies, no vessel could come round to his assistance: and now he saw himself in the utmost distress; for prince Edward had come up with his army to Newport, and waited only for day-light to begin the attack.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In this emergency, he decamped silently in the middle of the night, which, being dark and tempestuous, favoured his escape into North Wales; from whence he afterwards retreated through woods and over moun∣tains to Hereford, where he fixed his quarters, till he should find an opportu∣nity of crossing the Severne. Mean while he ordered his son Simon, who was engaged in the siege of Pevensey-castle, to relinquish that enterprize, and march immediately to his assistance. In obedience to this order he returned to Lon∣don, where he assembled a strong body of troops, including sixteen bannerets and their followers, and began his march for the banks of the Severne. In his route he took Winchester by storm, was admitted without opposition into Ox∣ford and Northampton, from whence he proceeded to Kenilworth, where his forces lay encamped in the most careless security. A man and a woman, who acted as spies for Edward in Simon's army, sent an account of their defenceless situation to that prince, who advancing immediately from Worcester, found Montfort's troops asleep, and took them all prisoners without resistance: his soldiers were enriched with a prodigious booty, and he numbered among his captives, the earl of Oxford, W. de Montchensy, Baldwin Wake, Hugh Neville, Adam de Neumarche, and many other persons of distinction. When he returned from this excursion to Worcester, he was informed that Leicester had passed the Severne in his absence, encamped at Kemsey, from whence he moved in the night to Evesham, in hope of being able to join his son next day at Kenilworth. Edward having received intimation of his design, put his army in motion about sun-set, giving out that his march was directed to Bridg∣north, that he might deceive the spies of the enemy: he accordingly took that route, in which having proceeded about two or three miles, he faced about for Evesham, which he invested in the morning before sun-rise.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Leicester at first mistook the prince's army for the forces under his son, whose disaster he had not yet learned; but he was soon undeceived by the banners of Gloucester and Mortimer, and ascending a small eminence to observe their number and disposition, was so struck with both, that he could not help exclaiming, <Q>“Lord have mercy upon our souls, for our bodies are doomed to destruction.”</Q> He did not, however, abandon himself to unmanly despair; but seeing himself surrounded on all sides, drew up his men in a com∣pact circle, and exhorted them to fight like brave men, whose lives and liber∣ties were at stake: at the same time he obliged the king to put on armour, that he might not be known, and expose himself in the front of the battle. Edward attacked his troops with incredible fury, so that the Welsh could not sustain his first onset, while Gloucester charged with equal intrepidity in ano∣ther
<PB N="540" REF="5490"/>
quarter. Notwithstanding the incredible efforts made by those two impe∣tuous commanders, and the precipitate flight of the Welsh, Leicester main∣tained the battle from two o'clock in the afternoon till night, with surprising obstinacy. The king was wounded in the shoulder, and in the most imminent hazard of his life, when calling out he was Henry of Winchester their king, he was saved by Adam de Mouhaut. Prince Edward hearing his voice, ran imme∣diately to the spot, and conducted him to a place of safety; and before he re∣turned Leicester was slain. His horse had been killed under him; and when he demanded quarter as he fought on foot, it was refused by his adversaries, who told him there was no quarter due to such a traitor. His son Henry did not long survive him; and his troops, seeing their principal leaders killed, were so disheartened that they made no further resistance: for by this time Hugh le D'Espenser, Ralf Basset of Sapcote, Peter de Montfort, John de Beauchamp, W. de Mandeville, Guy de Bardolfe, and all the barons, had shared the fate of the earl, except John Fitz-John, Nicholas de Seagrave, Henry de Hastings, Guy de Montfort, Humphrey de Bohun junior, and seven or eight others who were taken prisoners. In a word, all the people of consequence in that army, were either slain or taken; a great number of gentlemen and common soldiers fell in the field; and prince Edward obtained a complete victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Ch. Abingd. Bradv.</NOTE> which did not cost him above three lives of any consideration. The body of Leicester, being sound among the dead, was barbarously mangled and treated with indignity by Roger Mortimer, who ordered the head to be cut off and sent to his wife, as a testimony of his having completed this revenge upon his adversary.</P>

<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The face of affairs was intirely changed by the issue of this battle, which was fought on the fifth day of August, in the neighbourhood of Eves∣ham. Those who were formerly persecuted became oppressors in their turn, and the victors used their success with an uncommon rigour. The king, who was naturally vindictive and rapacious, resolved to sacrifice his enemies to those unkingly passions. He convoked a parliament at Winchester, in which the effects of the rebels were confiscated for the use of the crown; and it was resolved to besiege and destroy the city of London, which was always attached to the malecontents. The citizens being informed of this determination, and understanding they were adjudged to have forfeited their privileges, submit∣ted to the mercy of the king, who deprived London of its chains, barricadoes, gates, magistrates, and charter, which the inhabitants were obliged to redeem with a large sum of money; and Fitz-Thomas the mayor, with some of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was imprisoned, until they purchased a pardon with the best part of their substance. The confederated barons were persecuted with the utmost se∣verity: their effects were seized, and their persons hunted about from one place to another, until they were almost driven to despair. Simon de Montfort, eldest son of the earl of Leicester, had endeavoured to secure a protector in the per∣son of Richard, king of the Romans, who was a prisoner under his care in the castle of Kenilworth, from whence he now released him without ransom; and many other captives of note, who had been taken in the battle of Lewes, were set at liberty in the same manner: but Simon reaped no immediate advantage from his generosity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<PB N="541" REF="5500"/>
<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The king was implacable; and prince Edward resolved to extir∣minate the very seeds of opposition: Simon therefore quitted the castle of Kenil∣worth, in which he left a good garrison, and assembling the wreck of his fa∣ther's army, took possession of the isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, which he fortified as a retreat for himself and his friends, who joined him to a consider∣able number. Edward, judging it altogether improper to allow such a body<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1266.</NOTE> of enemies to maintain their footing in the middle of the kingdom, marched thither at the head of his forces, and found the place strongly fortified both by art and nature: nevertheless he carried on his attacks with such vigour, that the besieged, after an obstinate defence, were obliged to surrender upon assurance of life and limb; but with respect to their estates, they agreed to sub∣mit to the judgment of the king of the Romans and prince Edward. In con∣sequence of this capitulation, Montfort appeared before the king's court, where he found a warm advocate in the king of the Romans, who assured Henry, that immediately after the battle of Evesham, the garrison of Kenilworth would have murdered him, had not Montfort saved his life at the hazard of his own, and set him at liberty without ransom; he therefore begged that he would indulge him with a free pardon. This request was vehemently opposed by the earl of Gloucester; and as they did not chuse to disoblige that nobleman, it was resolved in council that Montfort should quit the kingdom, and enjoy an allowance of five hundred marks a year, provided he would surrender the castle of Kenilworth; though it was not in his power to fulfil this article, be∣cause the garrison would not obey his order. All the other rebels found in the isle of Axholme were pardoned, upon swearing that they would never carry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T. Wykes Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mat. Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> arms for the future against the king; an oath which was very ill observed in the sequel. And thus the tranquillity of the kingdom was restored.</P>

<P>In the midst of these transactions, the queen, who had resided two years in France, arrived in England, accompanied by Ottoboni, cardinal of St. Adrian, the pope's legate, fraught with several bulls from Clement X. con∣firming those of his predecessor against Leicester and his adherents, whom he now excommunicated whether dead or living: he likewise laid an interdict upon their lands; granted to Henry one year's tenth of all the revenues of the clergy; and summoned the bishops of Worcester, Chichester, Winchester, and London, to appear before him, to answer for their crimes, in supporting Leicester in all his rebellious measures, and disregarding the censures which the pope had denounced against that arch rebel and his adherents. The bishop of Worcester professed penitence, was absolved, and died; but the other three were sent to Rome, in order to undergo such punishment as the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> should think proper to inflict. Mean while Simon de Montfort, who seemed at first pretty well satisfied with his situation, withdrew privately from the prince's pa∣lace, and joined a set of pyrates belonging to the Cinque-Ports, who conferred upon him the command of their ships, with which he pillaged all vessels that fell in his way; and as it plainly appeared that these pyracies were favoured by the inhabitants of the Cinque-Ports, the king sent prince Edward to chastise them, not only for this injustice, but also for their continual attachment to the rebellious barons. He accordingly began his march for Winchelsea, which he took by storm; but the other ports submitted, upon promise of a general<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Though the barons had received a total overthrow at Evesham, and the king had in a manner destroyed the roots of that confederacy, the peace of the kingdom was not yet perfectly re-established; for the castle of Kenilworth st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l held out against the royalists; and there was a body in arms in the northern counties, which committed depredations in defiance of his authority. He detached his nephew Henry, son of the king of the Romans, against those freebooters, whom he surprized, defeated, and dispersed; but he could not secure the persons of their chiefs, who joining other malecontents, particularly those who had been dislodged from the isle of Axholme, took pos∣session of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sle of Ely in Cambridgeshire, from whence they made incursions into the neighbouring counties. At the same time, Adam Gurdon, for∣merly governor of Dunstar castle, celebrated for his strength and bravery, main∣tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1266.</NOTE> himself with eighty horse in the woods between Alton and Farnham, and ravaged the counties of Berks and Surrey, till prince Edward came upon him by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprize, while his followers were at some distance. He immediately sing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed out the prince, who commanded his attendants to retire; and a single combat ensued, in which they both manifested equal strength, courage, and dexterity: at length Adam's foot slipping, he fell to the ground, and remained at the mercy of the victor, who not only spared his life but took him into his service, in which Gurdon behaved ever after with the utmost fidelity.</P>

<P>By such vigorous proceedings, all the little insurrections and dis∣turbances were quelled in different parts of England; but the malecontents still kept possession of the isle of Ely; and Kenilworth castle was maintained by Henry de Hastings and William de Patishulle, who confided so much in the strength of the fortification, the stores of provision and ammunition that were in the place, the bravery of the garrison, that consisted of seventeen hun∣dred men, and the promise of Simon de Montfort, who assured them he would bring an army of foreigners to their assistance, that they would not listen to terms of submission. The king marched against this fortress in person, and summoned the governor to surrender, who, far from obeying his citation, was so barbarous as to cut off the hand of the pursuivant who delivered the message. The castle was immediately invested; but the garrison was so well provided, and made such a gallant defence, that it seemed impossible to re∣duce it any other way than by famine. As these troubles in a great measure arose from confiscating the estates of rebels, and bestowing them upon the king's adherents, Henry convoked a parliament in the town of Kenilworth, to miti∣gate the ordinance which had been enacted on this subject; and it was de∣creed in a new law, called the Dictum de Kenilworth, that all forfeited estates should be restored to the original owners, after a certain deduction for his ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty's use, according to the nature of the trespass or delinquency of the pro∣prietor. As for Henry de Hastings, he was, for his cruelty to the pursuivant, fined in a sum equal to the revenue of his estate for seven years; and the earl of Derby, who had twice rebelled, was condemned to imprisonment for the same term, if he would not chuse to throw himself altogether upon the king's mercy. This decree was published at Coventry, and in the hearing of the garrison of Kenilworth, on whom however it produced no effect. They con∣tinued to defend the place with surprising obstinacy, until their provision be∣ginning to fail, the soldiers growing sickly, and their hopes of assistance from
<PB N="543" REF="5520"/>
Simon de Montfort more and more languid, they agreed to surrender within forty days, if they should not be relieved, on condition of saving their lives, limbs, horses, and armour. The king accepting the proposal, hostages were delivered; and, at the expiration of the quarantine, the garrison marched out like so many spectres, withered and exhausted with fatigue and famine; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris. Claus. 50. H. III. Brady.</NOTE> their long confinement and sickness had occasioned such a stench, that the king's soldiers were almost suffocated when they first took possession of the castle, which Henry committed to the custody of his younger son Edmund, to whom he had already granted the honour of Lancaster, the stewardship of England, and all the estate of the late earl of Leicester.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The reduction of Kenilworth, and the prospect of subduing the rebels in the isle of Ely, seemed to efface all former misfortunes from the re∣membrance of Henry; and though Edward had sworn, to the earl of Glou∣cester, when he first espoused his cause, that he would use his best endeavours to re-establish the antient laws, and drive the foreigners from the king's coun∣cils, he now seemed more intent upon reducing the malecontents than incli∣nable to perform the articles of this obligation. As the affairs of Henry pros∣pered, both father and son acted with less restraint, and made the less scruple to extend the royal prerogative beyond the limits which the laws prescribed. It was not so much with a view to augment the regal power, as to prevent the earl of Leicester from usurping the throne, that the earl of Gloucester had exerted himself in behalf of prince Edward; and now foreseeing that should the malecontents be altogether oppressed, the king would render himself in∣tirely absolute, he thought it incumbent upon him to prevent such a calamity to the nation. With this view he demanded that the malecontents should be put in possession of their estates, according to the Dictum de Kenilworth: but Henry refusing to comply with the terms of his proposal, he retired to his own estate on the frontiers of Wales; engaged in a treaty with Llewyllen, and some noblemen in the neighbourhood; and sent promise of succour to the revolters of Ely. The court took umbrage at his absence and preparations; but as he cloaked these last with the pretext of a quarrel with Mortimer, the king gave himself no trouble to appease the discontent of such a powerful noble∣man, and bent all his thoughts towards the reduction of the rebels. He therefore assembled a parliament to concert measures, and grant a supply for this expedition; and as the earl of Gloucester did not appear, sent some noblemen to persuade him to come and take his place in the great assem∣bly of the nation. They found him busily employed in raising troops; and when they expressed their surprize at such preparation, he assured them those levies were destined against his enemy Mortimer, and in a writing, signed by his own hand, promised that he would never take arms against his majesty. This obligation quieted the suspicions of the king and parliament: they granted a subsidy for maintaining the war against the malecontents; and at the same time<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1267.</NOTE> the legate pressed the clergy to grant the same aid to his holiness; a demand which the prelates rejected with disdain.</P>

<P>As soon as the session broke up, Henry took the field with his troops; and, advancing into Cambridgeshire, summoned the rebels of Ely to surrender. But they trusted too much to their own valour, and the advan∣tages of their situation, to be dismayed by his menaces; and their obstinate
<PB N="544" REF="5530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> defence in the first attacks abated his courage in such a manner, that he re∣solved to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the arrival of prince Edward, who was then engaged in an exped<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion against John de Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, a northern baron, who had seized the castle of Alnewick, which however the prince compelled him to surrender at dis∣cretion. While the king and his son were thus employed, the earl of Glou∣cester put himself in motion with the troops he had assembled on his own estate and in the principality of Wales; and marched with such expedition, that he arrived in the neighbourhood of London before it was known whether he act∣ed for the king or in behalf of the malecontents. The magistrates who had been appointed by the king were doubtful of his design, and consulted with the pope's legate, whom Henry had left in possession of the Tower. The car∣dinal advised them to admit the earl, with a few attendants; and for some days he remained quiet, without betraying the least hint of his intention: but John D' Eguille arriving with a party of rebels from the north, and taking up his quarters in Southwark; and he being followed by another party from Ely, under the command of Robert de Willoughby, the magistrates, who could no longer mistake his purpose, ordered the drawbridge to be drawn up, and the gates guarded for their own security. Things continued in this posture for a fortnight, during which the earl secured the inhabitants in his interest; then seized the gates, and granted admittance to the troops of the malecontents. The populace chose a new set of magistrates; bulwarks and barbicans were erected between the Tower and the city; and Gloucester summoned the legate to surrender that fortress. At first he stood upon the defensive; when all com∣munication being cut off, so that he could receive no supplies of provision, he excommunicated all in general who disturbed the public peace, and laid an interdiction upon the churches of London. These censures were totally disre∣garded; and when he saw the earl making preparations to besiege him in form, he was fain to surrender at discretion. Gloucester having made himself master of the Tower, no longer concealed his designs, but, on the contrary, publish∣ed a manifesto, declaring that he had taken up arms to procure equitable con∣ditions to the revolters; and that he would not lay them down until he should have obliged the king and prince Edward to perform their promises, which they had hitherto neglected.</P>

<P>Henry, alarmed at these proceedings, and in the utmost ter∣ror of being attacked, sent pressing orders to his son to join him without delay; and these finding the prince upon his route from the north, he marched up to his father with great expedition. Then they advanced together towards Lon∣don, and took post at Stratford, within three miles of that capital, where they were joined by a great number of people, desirous of sighting under the ban∣ners of the prince, who was universally beloved and admired for his valour. The earl of Gloucester was not a little disappointed and chagrined when he understood how the royal army was continually reinforced; for, he had hoped that the whole kingdom would have espoused his cause, and that Henry would have been abandoned by his own forces; but now perceiving the royal army in∣creased to such a number, that he durst not hazard a battle, he remained within the walls of London, and resolved to extricate himself by a negotia∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

obtained more favourable terms than he had reason to expect. He was par∣doned for having taken arms against his sovereign; and the king's forgiveness was extended to the city of London; but he could not procure the same fa∣vour for the malecontents of Ely, with respect to whom the king and prince were implacable. Gloucester's troops being disarmed and dismissed, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Then the king resolved to chastise Llewellyn, prince of Wales, who had always furnished succours for the revolters. With this view he marched at the head of a nu∣merous army to Shrewsbury; and Llewellyn was fain to sue for peace, which he obtained by the mediation of the legate, on condition that the conquered lands should be restored on both sides, and the customs of the Marches pre∣served; that Llewellyn and his heirs should bear the title of prince of Wales, and all the Welsh barons do him homage and swear fealty; but that he and his successors should hold the principality by the like homage and fealty to the crown of England; and that he should pay five and twenty thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cart. 53.

<P>The troubles of the kingdom being thus appeased, the king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

As the peace of England was now restored, prince Edward and his cousin Henry received the cross from the hands of the legate, and their exam∣ple was followed by the earls of Warwick and Pembroke, above one hundred and twenty knights, and an infinite number of inferior rank, inured to military service during the war between the king and the barons. The tranquillity of the kingdom had been secured by certain regulations, established in a late par∣liament at Marlborough, known by the name of the Statute of Marlbridge. And now the king's coffers being quite exhausted, a talliage was laid on all ci∣ties, boroughs, and towns of his demesne. The itinerant judges, after a long interruption, resumed the practice of going the circuits, in order to settle the administration of justice in the different counties, after the late distractions; Ottoboni, having enacted some constitutions for the service of the church, which are still known by his name, took his leave of England about the be∣ginning of July, and the king of the Romans set out about the same time for Germany.</P>

Charles pretended that this right devolved to him, as king of the two Sicilies: he therefore demanded this tribute; and the Moorish king rejecting his proposal with disdain, he persuaded his brother Lewis to in∣vade his dominions, alledging that an expedition against the Saracens of Bar∣bary would be as acceptable to God as a new crusade against the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idels of Pa∣lestine, where he had already met with such bad success. Lewis, whose super∣stitious zeal was proof against the horrors of captivity, which he had already experienced, and weighed down every consideration of policy and common sense, agreed to join the troops of his brother Charles, in making a descent

upon the coast of Asrick, and was very desirous of engaging prince Edward in the same enterprize. For this purpose he invited him to his court, where he communicated the scheme, and secured his association with a loan of thirty thousand marks; in consequence of which they adjusted the particulars of the enterprize, and agreed to set out in the middle of August in the ensuing year. About this period, the king of the Romans returned to England with his new wife Beatrix de Falquemort, niece to Conrad archbishop of Cologne, a young lady whom he had espoused on account of her beauty alone, as he could reap no other advantage from such an alliance. This was a season very pro∣ductive of marriages in the royal family of England. His son Henry, com∣monly called Henry d' Almaine, had lately married Constance daughter of Gaston viscount of Bearne, the most powerful noblemen in Gascony; and his nephew Edmund, the younger son of king Henry, espoused Aliva daughter and heiress of William de Fortibus earl of Albermarle.</P>

<P>Prince Edward's thoughts were engrossed by considerations of a dif∣ferent nature. He employed his whole attention in preparing for his departure, while his father seemed to have nothing so much at heart as the celebration of the least of Edward the Confessor, and the translation of that saint's relics into a rich shrine of very curious workmanship. The ceremony was performed with great pomp and solemnity, the two kings bearing the relics on their shoulders, in presence of all the prelates and nobility of the realm. The parliament was assem∣bled in order to concert measures for the relief of the christians in Palestine; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 53.

The earl of Gloucester, who had also taken the cross, believing that prince Edward's reconciliation with him was not altoge∣ther sincere, did not chuse to trust himself at court, and even refused to take his seat in parliament; nor did he seem inclined to perform his vow of pilgri∣mage. Edward, unwilling to leave behind a nobleman whose power and am∣bition might kindle new dissensions in his absence, insisted upon his accom∣panying him to Palestine; and the earl as peremptorily refused to subject him∣self to any restriction in performing the vow he had made. This dispute might have produced very mischievous consequences, had not the king of the Romans<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He determined that the earl should accompany prince Edward to the Holy Land, unless hindred by sickness or some other necessary avocation; that he should receive eight thousand marks and a ship for his passage, provided he would join the prince with his followers on his arrival in Palestine; but, should he chuse to act by himself, the sum would be reduced to two thousand marks, and he should give security for applying it to the purposes of the crusade. He likewise obliged himself by a bond in the penalty of twenty thousand marks to keep the peace in England, even if he should be prevented from ful∣filling his vow; and agreed to deliver his castles of Tunbridge and Henley into the hands of the king of the Romans, by way of security, until advice should come of his arrival in the Mediterranean; and then Richard should restore them to his commissioners.</P>

<P>That the nation might be the better secured from disturbance, all the castles of importance were committed to the care of governors on whose fidelity the prince could depend. Robert earl Ferrers was set at liberty, and

put in possession of his estate, upon giving security for fifty thousand pounds to prince Edmund, who had received the grant of it when it was first forseited by Robert's rebellion. The king had indulged prince Edward with a grant of the Tower, and all his rights in the city of London, together with the duties on merchandize, which last he farmed to a company of Italian merchants; and exacted some customs in an arbitrary manner from the citizens of London, whom he still hated for their constant adherence to the barons, and the insults they had offered to his mother. Nevertheless he now remitted those illegal duties, and even procured from the king a new charter, which confirmed all their antient privileges; an indulgence by which he conciliated the affections of the inhabitants, who pres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted him with five hundred marks, in token of their gratitude and esteem. The nation now enjoying a profound calm, a parlia∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft.

The guardianship of Edward's son was vested in the king of the Romans; and the custody of his lands committed to Walter Giffard archbishop of York, Philip Basset, Roger de Mortimer, and Robert Wallerand. Precautions were taken for the administration, in case the king should die during his son's absence; and every mischievous consequence being obviated as far as human prudence could foresee, Edward took leave of his fa∣ther and uncle, and set out for France with his princess, his cousin Henry D'Almaine, William de Valence, Thomas de Clare, Roger de Clifford, and several other noblemen. Lewis had already landed near Tunis with an army of sixty thousand men, and taken the castle of Carthage; but he deferred his operations against the capital, until the arrival of his brother Charles king of Sicily, whom, however, he did not live to receive; for he was seized with an epidemical dysentery, which had already destroyed great part of his forces, and died in the arms of his son Philip the Hardy, who succeeded him on the throne of France. Charles landed immediately after his decease, and having worsted the Tunisians in several encounters, their king submitted to whatever terms he was pleased to propose.</P>

<P>Prince Edward hearing of the French king's death, would have proceeded directly for Palestine, according to his first intention; but being im∣portuned by Philip to join him in Africa, he sailed thither, and arrived at Tunis after the pacification. This war being finished, and the season far ad∣vanced, they resolved to pass the winter in Sicily; and Edward, during his residence in that country, thought proper to send back his cousin Henry D'Al∣maine to take care of Gascony in his absence, as he did not much depend upon the friendship and sincerity of Philip, who might be tempted to invade that province. He himself took shipping at Trapani early in the spring, and arrived in May at Acra, where his princess was delivered of a daughter: as for Henry D'Almaine, he accompanied the kings of France and Sicily to Viterbo, where great dissension prevailed among the cardinals about the choice of a pope to succeed Clement IV. and there he was basely assassinated in the church of the Franciscans, by his own kinsmen Simon and Guy de Montfort, sons of the late earl of Leicester.

<P>Henry having stayed twelve days at Norwich, returned to St. Edmundsbury, where he was seized with the malady which put a period to his life. He had already lost his brother Richard, king of the Romans, who is said to have been so deeply affected by the untimely death of his son Henry, that he never after enjoyed his health and spirits; at last he was struck with a palsy, which conveyed him to his grave, leaving a son called Edmund, who succeeded him as earl of Cornwal. Henry deeply felt the loss of this brother, who had assisted him with his advice in all emergencies, and sup∣ported his authority; and in a former indisposition, the king had appointed him guardian of the realm. His death must therefore have sat heavy upon Henry, and doubtless co-operated with his own distemper, which increasing daily, he ordered himself to be moved by easy journeys to Westminster; there finding his end fast approaching, he sent for the earl of Gloucester, and insisted upon his swearing to preserve the peace of the kingdom, and to the utmost of his power maintain the interest of his son Edward. That same night he ex∣pired, and next morning the great seal was delivered to Walter archbishop of
<PB N="549" REF="5580"/>
York, and the lords of the privy council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was buried before the high altar in West∣minster-Abbey. His children that survived him were, Edward who succeeded him on the throne, Edmund earl of Lancaster, Margaret queen of Scotland, and Beatrix dutchess of Bretagne: he had four younger sons and a daughter, who died in their infancy.</NOTE>. Henry was of a middle size and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> robust make, and his countenance had a peculiar cast from his left eye-lid, which hung down so far as to cover a good part of his eye. The particulars of his character may be gathered from the detail of his conduct. He was cer∣tainly a prince of very mean talents; irresolute, inconstant, and capricious, proud, insolent, and arbitrary; arrogant in prosperity, and abject in adversity; profuse, rapacious, and choleric, though destitute of liberality, oeconomy, and courage. Yet his continence was praise-worthy, as well as his aversion to cruelty; for he contented himself with punishing the rebels in their effects, when he might have glutted his revenge with their blood. He was pro∣digal even to excess; and therefore always in necessity, notwithstanding the great sums he levied from his subjects, and though his occasions were never so pressing, he could not help squandering away his money upon worthless fa∣vourites, without considering the difficulty he always found in obtaining sup∣plies from parliament.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Church, from the Conquest to the death of Henry III.</HEAD>
<P>§ XLV. William I. may be said to have conquered the church as well as the state. Many sees were filled with Norman prelates; many churches converted into lay-fees, and many abbeys bestowed upon the king's countrymen, to whom were appropriated the tythes of other churches held by the English. What∣ever obligations William had to the pope, he understood his own importance too well to suffer innovations of the court of Rome; he directed the conduct of his clergy in cases of a double election; nor could any ecclesiastical censures of consequence, be issued without his warrant. The first ecclesiastical synod<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1070.</NOTE> after the conquest, was held at Winchester, where Hermenfride, bishop of Sion, with Peter and John two priest-cardinals, presided in the name of the pope. The intention of this assembly was to depose Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, who was accused of holding that see and the bishopric of Winchester at the same time; of having worn, first, the pall of Robert his predecessor, and of having afterwards received one from Benedict X. who was an usurper. The first article was certainly an abuse; for which, however, he did not deserve privation: he pleaded that he only wore the pall of his predecessor until ano∣ther could be obtained for himself; and with respect to Benedict, that there was no other pontiff at that time in the papal chair. Notwithstanding this defence, he was deprived of his bishoprics and thrown into prison, where he ended his days. Agilmar, bishop of the East-Angles, underwent the same fate. Ano∣ther synod was held at Windsor, where Algeric, bishop of the South-Saxons, and many abbots were arbitrarily deposed, for no other crimes but that they were Englishmen. Those assemblies took into consideration the following ar∣ticles: The introduction of bishops and abbots by symoniacal heresy: Pro∣miscous ordination by means of money: The life and conversation of men so ordained: The celebration of councils by bishops twice a year: The ordination
<PB N="550" REF="5590"/>
of archdeacons and other ministers in their own churches: The free power of the bishops over the clergy and laity of their own dioceses: The penance of lay∣men recommended by bishops and priests: The apostacy of clerks and monks. It was likewise ordained, that the fees of bishops should be ascertained; that laymen should pay tythes; that no person should invade the goods of the church; that no clerks should bear secular arms; that clerks and monks<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> should be duly reverenced; and a curse was pronounced against those who should do otherwise.</P>

<P>Stigand was succeeded in the archbishopric of Canterbury by Lanfranc, a native of Pavia in the dutchy of Milan, whose learning and spirit had recommended him to William, who had raised him to the abbacy of Caen in Normandy. This prelate, upon his promotion to the see of Canter∣bury, impeached Wulstan bishop of Worcester, before the synod, for insuffi∣ciency in his office; though the true cause of this prosecution was a claim put in by Wulstan to certain lands which had been alienated from his see, when it was joined to that of York. The Saxon, however, made his claim good, and baffled all the arts of his antagonist. Thomas canon of Bayeux, was pro∣moted to the archbishopric of York, and Walceline, one of William's chap∣lains, to the see of Winchester: but these foreigners soon quarrelled among themselves. The archbishop of York, at his consecration, refused to swear canonical obedience to the see of Canterbury, though in consequence of the king's express injunction, he professed personal obedience to Lanfranc, but not to his successors. These two prelates going afterwards to Rome to obtain the pall, were very differently received by his holiness, who caressed Lanfranc, but deprived Thomas of his ring and pastoral staff, because he was the son of a priest; and he treated the bishop of Lincoln in the same manner for simony; though they were afterwards restored by Lanfranc, whom the pope vested with a legatine power for this and other purposes.</P>

<P>The dispute about precedency between the two archbishoprics was now resumed, and after a full hearing in an assembly of the clergy, decided in favour of Canterbury: the river Humber was fixed as the boundary between the two sees, and the archbishop of York obliged to quit his pretensions to the dioceses of Lincoln, Litchfield, and Worcester. But it was decreed, that his jurisdiction should extend over all the island to the north of the Humber. In a council held at Winchester, it was ordained, among other canons, that no bishop should hold two dioceses; that the sacrament should not be administred in beer, but in wine mixed with water; that dead bodies should not be buried in churches; and that chalices should not be made of wax or wood. About this time a certain penance was imposed upon every soldier who had been in actual service; and the pope's legate approved the ordinance, importing that a soldier shall do penance a year for every man he has slain in battle; for every single man he has struck, forty days; and if he knows not the number of men he has slain or struck, he shall do penance one day in every week, at the discretion of the bishop as long as he lives, or redeem it with perpetual alms, by build∣ing or endowing a church.</P>

In this interval a schism broke out in the church of Rome, by a competition for the papal chair, between Odo bishop of Ostia, who assumed the name of Urban II. and Gui∣bert of Ravenna, known by the appellation of Clement III. Rufus, by own∣ing neither, was troubled with no claims of ecclesiastical authority over the sees of his kingdom. The archbishopric was filled with Anselm, who obtained from the king a promise for the restitution of the lands which had been alienated from the see during its vacancy. The particulars of this prelate's struggles with the crown, have been already related in the civil history of that period. He acknowledged pope Urban, against the express command of his sovereign; and during his absence from England he assisted at the council of Bari, where he signalized himself in the dispute with the Greek prelates, concerning the procession of the holy spirit. He was also present at another council held in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>William the Conqueror, in his disputes with Stigand and some other bishops, had desired the pope to send a legate to preside in the councils which were convened on purpose to depose those prelates: and this was drawn into a precedent; for Henry I. no sooner mounted the throne, than the pope sent Guy archbishop of Vienna to London, in quality of legate, with a power ex∣tending over the whole island: but the English clergy looking upon this envoy
<PB N="552" REF="5610"/>
as an encroacher upon their privileges, remonstrated in such a manner, that the king would not allow the legate to exercise his authority in England. Henry had divers disputes with the court of Rome on the same subject. Conon, legate in France, under the papacy of Paschal II. summoned the bishops of Nor∣mandy to the councils which he convoked in that kingdom, and excommuni∣cated them on their refusal to obey his citation. Henry, incensed at the legate's presumption, sent the bishop of Exeter with complaints to the pope, who thought proper to give the satisfaction he demanded. This king being after∣wards in Norm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndy, the abbot Anselm, nephew to the archbishop of Canter∣bury of the same name, presented to him a commission, impowering him to exercise the legatine authority in England; and Henry consulting the bishops on this subject, they unammously d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clared that this legation was contrary to the privileges of the Anglicane church. The archbishop himself undertook to carry their remonstrance to the pope, and actually set out for Rome; but un∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rstanding that his holiness had retired to Beneventum before the arms of the emperor, he desisted from his journey, and sent the representation in writing. Paschal considering the situation of his affairs, was unwilling to give umbrage to the English nation, but at the same time equally averse to relinquish the right of sending over legates occasionally; he therefore returned an ambiguous answer, which, though by no means satisfactory to the bishops, the king inter∣preted in favour of the Anglicane church, and hindered the legate from exe∣cuting his commission.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He assembled a synod at London, touching the marriage of priests; but, in the writs of summons it was expresly declared, that the council was convoked by the order and with the concurrence of the archbishop of Canterbury. Altho' this legate knew his arrival was not at all agreeable to the English, he affected, in the exercise of his legation, an insolence of deportment which not a little increased their disgust. He insisted upon officiating in the church of Canter∣bury, although he was not a bishop; and in the council at London he or∣dered his seat to be raised like a throne, above the two archbishops and all the nobility of the kingdom. In the reign of Stephen, Alberic bishop of Ostia was received as the pope's legate in England, without opposition, because the king was so precariously situated that he durst not oppose the innovations of Rome. While this prince sat upon the throne, the pope invested his brother Henry bishop of Winchester with the legatine power, to the prejudice of Theobald archbishop of Canterbury. This distinction produced a quarrel be∣tween the two prelates, from which the court of Rome derived great advan∣tages; for, upon this occasion, both parties appealed to the Roman see, which be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore that time had been very little troubled with English disputes and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efe∣rences.

<P>But what Rome lost by schisms she regained by crusades, which never failed to extend her authority. The first was preached by Urban II. with such effect, that a vast army of christians, from all parts of Europe, took the cross and set out for Palestine, from whence they expelled the Saracens, and founded the kingdom of Jerusalem, which lasted about ninety years: but the country was afterwards reconquered by the infidels; and, in order to regain the footing which the christians had lost, divers new crusades were instituted, from which the popes drew manifold advantages. These expeditions furnished them with pretexts to intermeddle in all the affairs of Christendom; to divert princes from other designs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which were incompatible with the papal interest or ambition; to impose taxes on the clergy of different kingdoms; and to destroy those poten∣tates who presumed to oppose their usurpations; for they pretended that it was as necessary for the glory of God, to exterminate heretics as to war against infidels; and as it was their peculiar prerogative to determine what was and what was not heresy, they had it always in their power to publish and preach up crusades against such princes as incurred their displeasure.</P>

William Corboyl, who had succeeded to the see of Canterbury, solicited a legatine power for himself; and by this application, tacitly gave up the right enjoyed by his predecessors, who had always assembled national synods by virtue of their metropolitan power.

Notwith∣standing<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Accordingly each referred himself to the de∣cision of his holiness, who determined at last in favour of Theobald; and this determination was followed by a number of appeals from England, which

He was so popular that when he returned to his own province, the great confluence of people that came to welcome his arrival broke down a bridge, though no life was lost, nor any other damage ensued: a circumstance which the spectators ascribed to the piety of the good bishop, which could not, however, protect his own life from treachery; for, in less than a month after his return, he is said to have been poisoned by a priest in a consecrated chalice.</P>

Upon the death of the English pope Adrian, a schism ensued between Alex∣ander III. and Victor IV. the party of the former being espoused by Theobald archbishop of Canterbury, who prevailed with Henry to declare for the same pontiff in a synod held in Normandy, at which the agents of both competitors were present. It was in the course of the next year, that a council was called in England, against those wretched heretics called Publicans, whom we have already mentioned in the history. Theobald, after having filled the see of Canterbury for two and twenty years, was succeeded by Thomas Becket, whose disputes with king Henry we have already related in the reign of that monarch. Under this prince, the jurisdiction of the English church was ex∣tended by the conquest of Ireland; though the bishops of that country, even before it was conquered, had in some measure professed canonical obedience to the see of Canterbury. After Henry had regulated the first settlements of the English in that kingdom, a synod was held at Cashel, in which Nicholas, one of his chaplains, and Ralf archdeacon of Landaff assisted. Here it was decreed, that the Irish should not marry within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity; that the children should be catechised, and then receive baptism; that all chris∣tians should pay the tythes of their effects to the parish-churches in which they dwelled; that the lands of the church should be exempted from all services and burdens imposed by the laity; that the chieftians should no longer exact entertainment and free quarter for themselves or their families upon the estates of the clergy; that when a layman compounded for murder, no clergyman, though his relation, should be obliged to pay any part of the fine; that all masters of families, when visited by sickness, should make their wills in presence of their confessors and neighbours, and divide their goods and chat∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> into three portions, one for the benefit of the children, another to the wife, and the remainder set aside to defray the expence of the funeral; that those who were confessed immediately before death, should be buried with the usual cere∣monies;

<P>After the murder of Thomas Becket, prince Henry, in his father's ablence, ordered Odo prior of Canterbury to proceed to a new election: and the prior making a voyage to Normandy to consult the king, was desired to use his interest in behalf of the bishop of Baycux, who did not, however, obtain that dignity. We have already observed, in the history of Henry II. that the choice of the convent fell upon Roger abbot of Bec, who declined the honour; and then they chose Richard prior of Dover, against whom young Henry ap∣pealed to the pope; so that he was obliged to make a journey to Rome, where he was consecrated, and received the pall from his holiness. This new arch∣bishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1175.</NOTE> at his return convened a provincial synod at London; but Roger archbishop of York refused to appear in this council, because his cross was not allowed to be carried before him within the province of Canterbury; and the sees of Lincoln, Chester, Worcester, and Hereford, were not considered as dioceses annexed to the see of York. The clergy of this province demanded satisfaction of the archbishop of Canterbury for excommunicating the clergy of St. Oswald in Gloucester, because they would not submit to him as their metropolitan; and the clergy of St. Asaph petitioned that their bishop Godfrey, who had been driven from his diocese by the commotions of the Welsh, should be restored to his function. Godfrey however, who was guardian of the vacant abbey of Abingdon, resigned the bishopric, and the king filled up the abbey with another person; so that he found himself deprived of both livings. The decrees of this synod were levelled against the libertinism of the clergy and symoniacal practices; enjoining the payment of tythes; regulating the number of prefaces in the sacred catalogue; the manner of administering the eucharist; and prohibiting private marriages, especially between parties under the age prescribed by the canons. In the course of the ensuing year, another synod was held at Northampton, to which Henry summoned the king of Scotland and his clergy to own the superiority of the English church. They accordingly appeared at the time appointed; and as each archbishop claimed this superiority, the Scot made a handle of their dispute to refuse the sub∣mission; yet that he might not involve himself in a quarrel with Henry, he referred his cause to the determination of the pope, who sent cardinal Vivian over to England, with power to discuss and decide the controvesy. But the Scottish king perceiving that this legate was more bent upon extorting money than upon the arbitration of the difference, would not suffer him to enter his country until he had sworn he would attempt nothing to the prejudice of his crown and kingdom. It was in the course of this year that the indecent fray happened in a synod at Westminster, between the two archbishops, about pre∣cedency, in presence of Hugezun the pope's legate. We have already related that incident, and shall only add, that by the intercession of the king the two primates laid aside all animosity for five years, until the pleasure of the pope should be known; and Alexander decreed, that neither metropolitan should claim precedency of the other, but according to the seniority of their or∣dination. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den.

<P>In consequence of the pope's remonstrance to Henry concerning cer∣tain hardships sustained by the clergy, he granted the following concessions to
<PB N="556" REF="5650"/>
the importunities of Peter Leon sent over to negotiate this affair: No clerk shall be prosecuted in a secular court for any trespass or crime, nor appear personally in any action, unless the matter relates to the king's forests, or the fee is lay, and of consequence liable to service due to the king or some secu∣lar lord: No archbishopric, bishopric, or abbey, shall be kept vacant in the king's hands longer than one year, except upon urgent necessity: Those who are convicted, or confess the murder of any clerk, shall be punished by the jus∣ticiary of England, in presence of the diocesan: Clerks shall not be compelled to maintain their titles or character by single combat. The Scottish clergy are said to have submitted about this time to the archbishop of York as their metropolitan; but this dependency is absolutely denied by the writers and historians of that country, who challenge the English to produce any authentic acknowlegement of this submission, or to prove that any Scottish prelate was then<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> consecrated by the archbishop of York, or his license. The heresy of the Al∣bigenses now began to gain ground in France and England, notwithstanding the king's endeavours; which proving ineffectual, they were excommunicated. Their tenets nearly resembled those that are at present professed by the pro∣testants, though clouded over with the gloom of superstition. The pope con∣voked a lateran council to prevent abuses arising from the controverted elec∣tions of popes; and a great number of prelates from England, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as from other countries, assisted at this assembly. It was here decreed that no pope should be deemed duly elected, without the concurrence of two thirds of the electing cardinals; that the heretics should be proscribed; that no person should be promoted to a bishopric, unless he was turned of thirty, and well recommended for his learning; that no benefice should be promised away before a vacancy, or kept longer than six months vacant; that clergy∣men should not intermeddle in secular affairs, nor parochial priests enjoy plu∣ralities; that bishops should maintain those whom they have ordained, until they can be provided with livings; that Jews and Infidels shall not be per∣mitted to keep Christian slaves; that usurers, and those who plundered people who had suffered shipwreck, should be held as excommunicated; that the re∣tinue of archbishops should be limited to fifty horse, bishops to thirty, legates to five and twenty, and archdeacons to seven; that tilts and tournaments should be laid aside, on severe penalties; that every cathedral should furnish a school-master to teach the children gratis; that laymen should not grant tythes to one another; nor any clerk visit a nunnery without sufficient cause. Imme∣diately before this council, the abbot of St. Augustine's at Canterbury put himself and his society under the protection of the pope, that he might be ex∣empted from the profession of canonical obedience to the archbishop, who complained loudly of this encroachment upon his right, and wrote an ex∣postulatory letter to his holiness; in which he charges the court of Rome with a design to subvert the power of the bishops in behalf of religious houses. This remonstrance had such an effect upon the pope, that although he granted the exemption to the abbot, it was clogged with a salvo in favour of the arch∣bishop's dignity and prerogative.</P>

<P>Geffrey the king's natural son had been elected into the see of Lincoln, and enjoyed the revenues for seven years, without being consecrated; at last the pope offered him the alternative of receiving or relinquishing all

ecclesiastical preferment; and he accordingly resigned his diocese into the hands of the archbishop of Canterbury. A dispute still subsisted between that pre∣late and the abbot of St. Augustine's, who pleaded an exemption from archi∣episcopal jurisdiction, and refused to produce his charters until he was expresly commanded by the pope; and then they appeared with such flagrant marks of forgery that no regard was paid to their contents. The bishop of Rochester dying at this period, the metropolitan of Canterbury seized the temporalities, in right of his superiority over that see; and his claim being allowed by Henry, who was then greatly distressed in Normandy, the archbishop filled the va∣cancy with Walleran archdeacon of Bayeux. Pope Lucius being oppressed by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Vivian having spunged England and Scotland, had crossed the sea to Ireland, where he laid the clergy under contribution, and even instigated the Irish to rebel against the English, who took the city of Downe while he resided in the place, and compelled him to take sanctuary in the cathedral: but, being furnished with passports from the court of England, he was treated with great respect, and af∣terwards held a national council at Dublin, where he attempted to bring the church of Ireland to an entire conformity with that of Rome, and to exact money from the inhabitants. He was disappointed however in both aims by the vigilance of the English government, and leaving that kingdom returned to Scotland.</P>

<P>As the state and church affairs were very much interwoven in this reign, we have in the civil history given a detail of the dispute which happened between the monks of St. Augustine's and the suffragans of Canterbury, about the election of a prelate to succeed Richard, together with Henry's design of electing a society of regular canons at Hackington, which was prevented by the pope's interposition. Baldwin the new archbishop likewise formed a scheme for bringing the monks of Christ-Church intirely under his subjection; but was baffled by their superior interest at the court of Rome. At Henry's death, the sees of York, Winchester, Ely, Salisbury, and London, were vacant;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1189.</NOTE> and at an ecclesiastical synod held by Richard at Pipewell in Northampton∣shire, the archbishopric was conferred upon Geffrey, the king's natural brother, formerly elect of Lincoln; William Longchamp, chancellor and prime mi∣nister to Richard, was elected bishop of Ely; Winchester was bestowed upon Godfrey de Lucy; London was given to Richard, archdeacon of Ely; and Salisbury to Hugh Walter, dean of York. Geffrey was obliged to pay a round sum to the king before he would approve of his election, and the arch∣bishop of Canterbury entered a claim to the privilege of giving him conse∣cration. This produced a dispute that still depended, when the cardinal of Anagni was sent as legate by the pope, to adjust the difference between the archbishop and the monks of Canterbury; but the king forbade him by a man∣date to proceed farther than Dover, without his express order. Yet when Ri∣chard, in conjunction with the queen mother and the archbishops of Rouen and
<PB N="558" REF="5670"/>
Dublin, had effected a sol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d accommodation, the legate was invited to Canter∣bury. This was a revival of the former dispute about the canonical obedience, building the church at Hackington, and forcing a prior upon the convent. By the pacification it was agreed that the church should be left unfinished, the prior laid aside, and the monks profess canonical obedience to the see of Can∣terbury. The opposition against Geffrey elect of York was now increased; the bishops of Durham and Salisbury protested against the election, because it was made in their absence; the dean and treasurer of York excepted to his person, because he had been born in adultery, and concerned in bloodshed while he fought against the rebels in defence of his father's government. These protests were followed by appeals to the pope, who impowered the legate to decide the affair. It was accordingly brought to a hearing, when he deter∣mined in favour of the elect; the king prevailed upon his opposers to with∣draw their appeals, and the archbishop of Canterbury attending Richard in his expedition to Palestine, the disputes concerning his consecration were removed. Baldwin dying at the siege of Ptolemais, the king wrote to his mother in fa∣vour of Hubert bishop of Salisbury, who likewise accompanied him in the crusade; and that prelate was chosen as his successor in the see of Canterbury. When Richard reterned, the clergy of York complained to the pope of their archbishop, whom they accused of divers irregularities, and of discouraging appeals to the court of Rome. His holiness immediately granted a commis∣sion to the bishop of Lincoln, the archdeacon of Northampton, and the prior of Pontefract, for trying the archbishop; and suspending him if guilty, unless he would in three months make his personal appearance at Rome. Geoffrey paid very little regard to this injunction, and as the bishop of Lincoln refused to execute the pope's order, that pontiff suspended Geoffrey from all temporal and spiritual jurisdiction.</P>

<P>Mean while Hubert archbishop of Canterbury was vested with a le∣gatine commission, by virtue of which he held an assize and synod at York, where he enacted some canons to prevent and reform the avarice and corruption of priests, as well as the practice of false swearing, against which they de∣nounced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Johnson's Canons.</NOTE> the sentence of excommunication. After this progress the metropo∣litan, as we have observed in another place, erected a chapel at Lambeth, with a view to establish secular canons, according to the scheme formerly projected at Hackington; but the monks of Canterbury having recourse again to the see of Rome, the pope ordered him to desist from his design. Hubert had not such weight and influence with his holiness at that time as he afterwards acquired under the succeeding reign, when Giraldus Cambrensis the historian being elected bishop of St. David's, laid claim to the right of metropolitan over the sees of Landaff, Bangor, St. Asaph, Chester, Hereford, and Worcester, and refused to profess canonical obedience to the see of Canterbury; but Hu∣bert's interest proved too powerful for Giraldus, who was obliged to renounce his election, and another was consecrated in his room. At the same time the dispute between the archbishop and the monks was reconsidered and compro∣mised: he was allowed to build the chapel at Lambeth, but limited in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

At the next national synod held at Westminster, some canons were made touching the celebration of baptism and the payment of tythes, which was always enforced in every

council; and all Templars, Hospitallers, or other religious, were forbidden to receive tythes from laymen, without the consent of the bishop. In the suc∣ceding year, one Eustace abbot of Flay, supposing that the Lord's day ought to begin at three o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, and continue till Mon∣day at sun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rising, produced a forged letter pretended to be written by Christ himself against the practice of profaning the Sabbath, and found on the altar of St. Simeon at Golgotha near Jerusalem. Though he himself contrived this imposture, his zeal got the better of his senses. In the actual belief that this letter was genuine, he preached all over England against the impiety of breaking the Lord's day, and wrought up his hearers to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they looked upon him as an apostle; and all markets, fairs, and labour, which had been held or practised on Sunday were now laid aside.</P>

<P>In the history of John's reign we have been so circumstantial in re∣lating his disputes with the pope, that very few ecclesiastical affairs of any con∣sequence remain to be recorded. The pope being desirous of levying an ex∣traordinary Romescot or St. Peter's penny, the bishops assembled a synod to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1206.</NOTE> deliberate upon his demand; but the king forbidding them to proceed, they separated without having come to any resolution. Nevertheless, a legate named Florentin convoked another council at Reading, upon the same subject; and as if the clergy had influenced the king's refusal, he extorted from them a sub∣sidy in lieu of the extraordinary Romescot, which would have affected the whole kingdom. We have already mentioned the councils that were assembled to regulate the restitution to the exiled bishops, after John's reconciliation with his holiness; but we shall take notice of the twelfth council of the lateran, held during this reign by pope Innocent III. at which four hundred and twelve bishops assisted. This assembly enacted fourscore canons: one of which in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> formal terms establishes the doctrine of transubstantiation; but the third seems to have been calculated for raising the ecclesiastical power on the ruins of all civil right and authority: by this the council decreed that all sovereigns should be required and sollicited, and if need were, constrained by ecclesiastical cen∣sures to promise upon oath that they would exert their endeavours to exterm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nate heretics from their dominions: That the same oath should be exacted from all persons promoted to any dignity spiritual or temporal: That if any temporal lord refused to purge his country or demesnes of heretics, after having been summoned for that purpose, he should be excommunicated by the metropo∣litan, assisted by his suffragans; in case of contempt or refusal of satisfac∣tion within one year, that the pope should declare his subjects and vassals absolved from their oath of allegiance; and at the same time exhort the catho∣lic princes to fall upon his territories, saving the right of paramount to the sovereign of the fief, provided there should be such a right; on condition how∣ever that the sovereign should do nothing to the prejudice of this canon. In<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1216.</NOTE> the fourteenth it was decreed that priests who abandoned themselves to de∣bauchery in those places where marriage was permitted, should be more se∣verely punished than those who lived in countries where they were obliged to profess celibacy. From which article we learn that the celibacy of the priests was not universally established.</P>

<P>The greatest part of the councils held in the long reign of Henry III. were convoked, as we have elsewhere observed, to authorize and facilitate

The same prelate convoked another council, in which, among other regulations, a canon was enacted, confirming the prohibition of marriage in priests; so that the clergy of England seem to have neglected the former decrees on that subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch 1397.</NOTE> Otho, the pope's legate, convoked a national synod in St. Paul's church in London; and, as he expected an opposition to the canons which he intended to pass against pluralities, he obtained of the king a guard of two hundred men. As soon as the prelates had taken their places, he ordered the canons which he had brought from Rome, to be read; and when the article prohi∣biting pluralities was mentioned, Walter de Chantelou bishop of Winchester, and some others, oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed it with great vehemence, and even made protests; so that the legate declared it should remain in force only during the time of his legation: nevertheless, it was no sooner approved on this condition, than an ecclesiastic, in the legate's train, pronounced aloud a decree of the pope, ordaining it to be observed for ever. In the other canons it was decreed, that the number of the sacraments should be fixed to seven: others fixed the vigils of Easter and Pentecost; regulated the administration of baptism; and enjoined the clergy to reside at their benefices at least one half of the year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1239.</NOTE> At a council held in London, the clergy flatly refused to supply the legate with the money which he demanded for the expence of his legation; and when he assembled another synod in the course of the succeeding year, he met with no better success in demanding one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fth part of their revenues for the use of his holiness. All the ensuing councils, for the space of four years, were convened on purpose to demand subsidies from the clergy. During the war of the barons, one was held at Reading, in which was confirmed the appeal of the barons from the proceedings of the legate, who resided at Bou∣logne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1266.</NOTE> and in another convened at Northampton, the legate Otho excommu∣nicated all the members of the clergy, who had engaged in the party of the earl of Leicester. The same cardinal assembled a national council in St. Paul's church at London, where he published certain constitutions, some of which make now a part of the canon law of the English church. The first allowed laymen to administer baptism, in case of necessity: the second forbad priests to take money for the administration of the sacraments: the ninth ordained ecclesiastics to reside at their benefices: the thirteenth confirmed the right of sanctuary to churches: the fourteenth decreed that marriages should be cele∣brated in public: the twentieth forbad commutation of penance: the twenty∣third prohibited the alienation of any part of the tythes due to the parochial curates: the thirtieth was enacted against pluralities: the next forbad the practice of giving benefices in commendam, and vacated all those that were bestowed in such a manner: the thirty-second ordained that, before the con∣secration

<P>These are the principal councils held in England during the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collier. Johnson.</NOTE> reign of Henry III. by which we see the progress of the papal power, and the state of the English clergy. It may be necessary, however, to observe, that the popes used the same artifice in passing unpopular canons, which has been of late years frequently practised to pass a ministerial bill in parliament; they tacked them to a number of other useful laws, which no member could oppose without subjecting himself to the imputation of raising obstacles to public utility. We likewise observe with what industry the court of Rome endea∣voured to establish the celibacy of priests; what difficulty they found in fixing that regulation, especially in England, where we find married priests, in the latter end of this reign, even a prelate the son of a bishop; and in the time of Henry II. the pope expressing his surprize that the bishop of Ely had not gone to Rome to demand his confirmation, the English resi∣dent told his holiness, the elect had an evangelical excuse, for he had lately married a wife. We are told by Baronius, that a legate sent into Poland by pope Innocent III. to establish the celibacy of priests, had succeeded in his commission; but that he ran the risk of his life, by endeavouring to settle the same custom in Bohemia. There was another article of great importance to the popes, which they did not fail to labour at with the utmost assiduity. This was to give their ordinances or decretals the same authority which was in the canons of councils. One Gratian published a collection of decretals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1150.</NOTE> containing all the ordinances which had been published to that time, that they might serve as rules for the administration of ecclesiastical justice. To this collection was added a number of decrees made in the sequel, so as to consti∣tute a complete body of canon law. Raymond de Pignaford, penitentiary of Gregory IX. was employed to make this collection, which was intitled, The Second Part of the Canon Law; and to this he joined some constitutions of councils, and decisions of doctors, posterior to the period at which it begun. It was not only a supplement, but also, in some places, an alteration of the anti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt canon law: for example, it decrees that bastards cannot be admitted to ecclesiastical functions, without a dispensation from the pope. Thus the court of Rome arrogated to itself the power of favouring bastards occasionally, though contrary to the antient constitutions of councils. Indeed that court could not chuse a more favourable conjuncture for publishing its decretals; for it was now at the very summit of its greatness. There was neither a prince or private person, who du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st oppose the will of the pope when he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be obeyed. He therefore enacted laws very often opposite to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which had been formerly observed. The civil law of England con∣sidered children born before marriage, as illegitimate, even though their pa∣rents should have been afterwards joined in wedlock; but the canon law legi∣tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted all such children: and this very ordinance produced violent debates in the parliament assembled at Merton. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The popes had no sooner rendered themselves absolute masters of the church, than it was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with an inu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dation of religious orders, which

The council of the lateran had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to prevent or reform this abuse, by expressly forbidding the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w order of monks. Nevertheless, Dominick Gusman, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who had long preached against the Albigenses, formed the scheme of a new order, under the name of the Friars Preachers, for which he de∣manded the confirmation of pope Innocent III. That pontiff at first made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> difficulty, on account of the prohibition; but he afterwards pretended to have had a celestial vision, by which he was given to understand, that he could not take any step that would be more advantageous to the church. Nevertheless, the order was not confirmed till the pontificate of his successor Honorius, when it was instituted under the name of the Friars Preachers, or Preaching Brothers, because the individuals were destined to preach against the heretics. They were likewise distinguished by the appellation of Domini∣cans, from the name of their founder, and in France called Jacobins, from the street of St. Jaques, where they had their first house in Paris. They were intrusted with the care of the inquisition, and rendered themselves famous by the barbarities they committed against the pretended heretics: and they settled<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>217.</NOTE> in England in a very little time after their institution. The order founded by Francis d'Assisi, was confirmed by the same pontiff, and, in the course of the year that succeeded their confirmation, they were settled in England. The monks out of modesty assumed the name of Minor Brothers; and though, in the sequel, they were divided into different societies, all of them owned St. Francis d'Assisi for their chief and founder. They were restricted, by their rules, from preaching or confessing in any diocese, without the permission of the bishop. This restriction, however, did not long continue: they repre∣sented to the pope, that many christians were ashamed to confess their sins to their own pastors; that several persons scrupled to perform their duty, be∣cause they knew the curates themselves guilty of the same transgressions; and that those priests had not discretion to keep the secrets with which they were entrusted. On these considerations, they desired and obtained a dispensation for that rule of their order. The Dominicans and Franciscans acquired such reputation for sanctity, that almost every person chose a director from one of those orders; consequently the churches they received, were very consi∣derable: for a long time, the popes were elected from one or other of these societies; so that, by their credit at the court of Rome, they frequently obtained effects belonging to other orders, on pretence of the necessity for their being subsisted. They amassed prodigious wealth from benefactions of devout people, even in their life-time, as well as from donations and legacies extorted from dying people, by the threats or promises of future misery or<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1244.</NOTE> salvation. In a council held at Rochester, a new order of monks, called Cross-bearers, demanded permission to settle in England; and produced a bull from the pope, forbidding all persons whatsoever to reproach or molest them, and empowering them to excommunicate those who should violate that privilege. The synod did not think proper to grant their request; but sent them back, on pretence of adhering to the canon passed in the council of the lateran.</P>

<P>The most remarkable ecclesiastics who lived in England from the conquest to the death of Henry III. were the following: Aldred arch∣bishop of York, who crowned William the Conqueror; he had been formerly bishop of Gloucester, and built the cathedral of that city: he was a pious and worthy prelate, and a great benefactor to the monastery of Beverley. Stigand archbishop of Canterbury was at first very much respected by William the Conqueror, though he afterwards procured his deposition: this prelate, being deprived of his dignity, was thrown into prison, because he refused to discover the place where his treasure was deposited; he died in confinement, and, after his death, a small key was found hanging to his neck, together with a paper describing the place where his wealth was concealed. Marianus Scotus, born<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1028.</NOTE> in Scotland, retired at the age of thirty, to the monastery of Cologne, from whence he was removed to the abbey of Fulde, where he wrote a chronicle, beginning at the creation, and ending in the year one thousand and eighty∣two of the christian aera: the Scots were at that time very well received in Germany, where fifteen monasteries were founded by a prince of their nation, who had served in the wars of Charlemagne, and all the abbots were natives of Scotland. Wulstan bishop of Worcester was renowned for his piety, and said to have worked miracles, both before and after his death: we have already observed, that Lanfranc accused him in a council of ignorance and incapacity: his chief merit seems to have consisted in an inoffensive life, and yet he had a considerable share of self-conceit; for when the monks, who attended him in his last moments, expressed their affliction at the prospect of losing such a pillar of the church, he bade them be of good cheer, for he should be able to patronize them more powerfully after his death, than ever he had been during the course of his life. Lanfranc was born at Pavia; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> after he had finished his studies, made a monk in the abbey of Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Nor∣mandy, where he taught logic with great reputation: he treated his brother monks with such contempt for their ignorance, that they conspired against him, and trumped up an accusation, which they presented to William the Conqueror, before his expedition into England; he was therefore obliged to appear at court in his own justification, and, upon that occasion, insinuated himself so far into the favour of his sovereign, that he made him abbot of St. Stephen's at Caen, from whence he was afterwards removed to the see of Canterbury. The credit which he maintained during the reign of the Con∣queror, declined under William Rufus, whom he had actually raised to the throne: he rebuilt the church of Canterbury, which had been burnt by the Danes, and limited the number of the monks of St. Augustine to one hundred and fifty; he likewise established a prior in that convent, whereas they were formerly governed by an abbot: he wrote a commentary on the epistles of St. Paul, and an ecclesiastical history, which is not extant; but the most esteemed of all his works, was a treatise composed against Berenger, in defence of the real presence in the sacrament: notwithstanding this proof of his orthodoxy, Gregory VII. summoned him to appear at Rome, and give an account of his faith, on pain of suspension; but this order he never obeyed.</P>

<P>Anselm abbot of Bec, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, made more noise than all the prelates of the English church, by his quarrels with William Rufus and Henry I. Clement the antepope being still alive,
<PB N="564" REF="5730"/>
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Urban II. was elected, England refused to acknowledge either the one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other; till Anselm, embroiling himself with William Rufus, declared <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Urban; in order to thwart the king, who seemed to favour his com∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor. William, resolving to humble him for his presumption, gave Urban to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderstand, that if he would send to him the pall designed for Anselm, so a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the bishop should receive it from his hands, he would reduce the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urch of England to his obedience. The pope agreed to the proposal, and sent the bishop of Alba into England, to transact the affair: William executed h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngagement by acknowledging Urban in the most solemn manner; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he demanded the pall, the nuncio told him, that no bishop could receive it from the hands of a layman; so that he found himself outwitted by the craft of Rome. William never forgave the pope, nor the prelate, who was obliged to leave the kingdom, and continue abroad till the death of that mo∣narch. During his residence at Rome, he assisted at a council, in which ex∣communication was denounced against all ecclesiastics, who, for the future, should receive the investiture of their benefices from the hands of laymen; and it was in consequence of this decree, that when he was recalled to England, by Henry I. he refused to do homage to that prince, or consecrate the bishops who had been invested by him. As this refusal affected the king's preroga∣tive, he resented it highly; but that he might not break with Rome, at a time when the papal power was very formidable, he sent ambassadors to Paschal II. to complain of this encroachment, and desire he would order Anselm to con∣form to the customs of the kingdom. The pope refused to grant a request which was contrary to the decrees of several councils. Henry would not part with his rights; and commanded the archbishop to do him homage, and consecrate the prelates, who had received the investiture according to the usual form. Anselm still held out, and the king ordered him to quit the realm. He rejected this command; and the king's council was of opinion, that Henry should banish the archbishop, and renounce all dependence upon the pope. It was resolved, however, in a general assembly, that ambassadors should be sent to Rome, in order, if possible, to prevail upon the pope to desist from his pretensions. The archbishop of York and two other prelates were charged with this commission; and Anselm sent two agents at the same time to main∣tain his cause before his holiness. The ambassadors told the pope, that he must either relax in the article of investiture, or see Anselm banished, and all England withdrawn from its obedience to the Roman see. Paschal replied, that he would rather forfeit his own dignity, than give up the least tittle of his pretensions. Negotiations were ineffectually set on foot; and the dispute was inflamed to such a degree of animosity, that Paschal threatened to excommu∣nicate the king, and Anselm was obliged to retire to Lyons. The difference, however, was at length compromised between Henry and the archbishop, by the mediation of Adela countess of Blois, the king's sister, who procured an interview between them, at the castle of L'Aigle in Normandy, where they discussed the articles of agreement; and the pope confirmed the accommoda∣tion. The king renounced the right of bestowing the investiture of benefices; and the pope permitted bishops and abbots to do homage to the sovereign, for the ecclesiastical fiefs in their possession. Anselm composed several theological
<PB N="565" REF="5740"/>
treatises, and was canonized in the reign of Henry VII. at the sollicitation of cardinal Moreton.</P>

<P>Gilbert bishop of London, in the reign of Henry I. was, on ac∣count of his learning, int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuled Universalist: he composed a commentary on the Psalms of David, and an exposition of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. We have already mentioned Osmond bishop of Salisbury, who was earl of Dorset and privy counsellor to William the Conqueror. The liturgy which he composed, was adopted by all the dioceses in England. Malachy archbishop of Armagh in Ireland was famous for his predictions about the popes that oc∣cupied St. Peter's chair, after the time in which he lived. His prophecies are still extant, and written in such an ambiguous manner, as to admit of any sort of interpretation: his life was written by St. Bernard. Ingulph was known to William before his conquest, when he visited Edward the Confessor; he served that prince in the station of secretary, and afterwards went on a pil∣grimage to Jerusalem. At his return, he became a monk in the abbey of Fontevrand, from whence he was removed by William, who created him ab∣bot of Croyland, where he died, after having writ the history of his convent, inserted in the collection of old English historians. Joffrid, his immediate successor in that monastery, is said, by some authors, to have been the first who opened schools at Cambridge, where he settled four of his monks as professors. God∣frid prior of the monastery of Winchester, was one of the best writers of the age. Among other works, he composed a panegyric upon the primates of Eng∣land: he reformed the stile of the breviary, which abounded with barbarisms; and is said by Alford, to have been the real corrector of the liturgy, which passed under the name of Osmund bishop of Sarum. John of Salisbury was one of the ornaments of the English church, renowned for his knowledge, politeness, and morality: he was the intimate friend of pope Adrian IV. who often complained to him of the cares and troubles that attended the possession of St. Peter's chair; he attached himself to the fortune of Thomas Becket, whom he followed to France, and by whose means he obtained the bishopric of Chartres: he wrote a book intituled Polycraticon, or de Nugis Curialium. As for Thomas Becket and Stephen Langton, we have elsewhere described their characters at large. Baldwin archbishop of Canterbury, who attended Richard to the Holy Land, passed for a good theologician; and some of his books still extant justify that encomium. Hugh bishop of Lincoln, a native of Grenoble, was one of the most illustrious prelates of the Anglicane church, under the reigns of Richard I. and John. His censures were very much dreaded among his diocesans, because they observed that those whom he excommuni∣cated were generally overtaken, even in this life, by the judgment of heaven. He is said to have removed, by his sole authority, the tomb of Rosamond, mis∣tress of Henry II. from the church of Godstow in Oxfordshire, where it stood in the middle of the choir, covered with black velvet, and surrounded with wax tapers: though he was told that the tomb had been placed there by the king's order, he thought it was scandalous that the monument of a loose woman should maintain such a sacred place. He died in great reputation for sanctity, and was canonized by Honorius III. During the quarrel between king John and the pope, an ecclesiastic called Alexander Cementarius, who had been pro∣fessor of theology in the university of Paris, publicly maintained in his sermons,
<PB N="566" REF="5750"/>
that the pope had no power to deprive kings of their crowns; and by this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>octri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he brought upon himself the persecution of the see of Rome, which red<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him to the condition of a common beggar. Walter Gray archbishop of York, distinguished himself as a minister of state, enriched his diocese with the addition o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the lands of Thorpe purchased with his own money, and built a magni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cent structure, which was at first called York palace, but afterwards known by the name of Whitehall. Edmund, who from a canonicate of Sa∣lisbury, was promoted to the archbishopric of Canterbury, after the pope had ann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed three elections in his favour, was a prelate of great moderation and re∣gular<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of life. He would have opposed the usurpations of Rome, had not the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al power been then at its summit in England; but finding it irresistible, he ret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to the monastery of Pontigny in France, where he shortened his days by his austerities, and was canonized by pope Innocent IV. Richard P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, at first bishop of Salisbury, and from thence translated to the see of Dur∣h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded the inhabitants of Old Sarum to remove to the place which is now called Salisbury, where he founded a noble church that remains to this day. He likewise composed synodal constitutions for the use of his church, in eighty-seven articles, by one of which it plainly appears that the laity at that time communicated in both species. Alexander Hales, a native of Gloucester, so deeply ski<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led in the canon law, that he acquired the title of the Irrefragable doctor, was professor in the university of Paris; he composed annotations on the bible and other works, that contain a great deal of logic and metaphysics. Siwald archbishop of York was an able theologician, of an irreproachable life<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he modelled his conduct on that of Edmund archbishop of Canterbury, who had been his master; he was so provoked at the extortion of Rome, that he wrote a letter to the pope complaining of his exactions; and among other things observed, that when Jesus Christ gave charge of his sheep to St. Peter, he did not command him either to fleece or to flay his flock. In consequence of this remonstrance, and his refusing to admit certain Italians who brought provisions from the court of Rome, he was severely rebuked by his holiness, and at length excommunicated. In his last moments he complained bitterly o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pope's injustice, from which he appealed to the judgment of God Almighty. Robert Kilwarby archbishop of Canterbury, was a prelate of ex∣tensive learning for the age in which he lived; being raised to the dignity of a cardinal he resigned his archbishopric, and fixed his habitation in Rome. One of the most famous ecclesiastics of this age, was Grosted bishop of Lincoln, a bold and resolute prelate, whom the favours of the court could not allure, nor the menaces of the pope intimidate; solely attached to the dictates of reason and equity, he had no respect of persons or circumstances, and opposed the king or the pope occasionally, according to the suggestions of his own con∣science: by this fortitude, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquired great reputation among the people, ac∣customed to see their bishops always submissive to one or other of those powers. Having one day excommunicated a sheriff, who refused to imprison a man who scoffed at the censures of the church, Henry III. was incensed at his having neglected to address himself on this occasion to the royal authority, and com∣plained to the pope of his presumption. Grosted was obliged to make a jour∣ney to Rome, in order to justify his conduct, and there he was confirmed in his bad opinion of the papal power. He could not, without indignation, behold
<PB N="567" REF="5760"/>
the best benefices of the kingdom conferred upon Italians, who neither resided upon their livings, nor understood the language of the country; and because he refused to receive one of these foreigners into the richest living of his diocese, he was suspended by his holiness. Nevertheless he continued his functions at the desire of his flock, and still persisted in refusing to admit the pope's provi∣sions in favour of other Italians, saying, that to entrust the care of souls with such ministers, would be to act in the name of the devil, rather than by the authority of God. The pope, rather than run the risk of a total revolt in the church of England, winked at the disobedience of this prelate, who was ex∣tremely beloved by the people. He endeavoured to win him over to his in∣terest by gentleness and insinuation; and as a mark of his esteem, sent him a commission to reform some abuses which had crept into the monasteries. Not∣withstanding this proof of his confidence and favour, Grosted afterwards in∣flamed his resentment, by making a calculation of the money drawn every year from England, by the Italian clergy who enjoyed livings in this king∣dom: but as he would not venture to persecute the bishop upon this subject, which might have excited clamours dangerous to his interest, he sent a threaten∣ing brief to him, on account of his having refused to receive the papal pro∣visions; and this the prelate tore and trampled under his feet, in sight of all his clergy. Not contented with having expressed his disdain in this manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Paris. Collier. Johnson.</NOTE> he wrote a letter to the pope with such spirit and freedom, as seems almost in∣credible, considering the superstition of those times, and the abject veneration with which the clergy in general obeyed the papal authority.</P>

<P>After this short sketch of church-transactions, and the charac∣ters of the prelates who distinguished themselves for their piety and learning, we shall now take a transient view of the historians who flourished in England, during this period of time. Florence monk of Worcester composed a chroni∣cle of the world, from the creation to the year of Christ 1118, supposed to be an epitome of a larger work of the same nature, compiled by Marinus. Alu∣red or Alfred, treasurer of the college of Beverley, began his history during the difference between Henry I. and Anselm archbishop of Canterbury. Eadmer was intimately connected with this prelate, and wrote the history of the two Williams and Henry I. In the same age lived William of Malmesbury, whose chief work is intituled De Gestis Anglorum: he was patronized by Robert the renowned earl of Gloucester, of whom we have treated at large in the history of Stephen. Simeon of Durham was a monk of that place, of indefatigable in∣dustry in collecting the principal monuments of learning, which had escaped the Danish barbarity. He flourished in the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen; and his history, which is chiefly taken from Florence of Worcester, reaches no farther than the year 1129. The chronicle of Melros was composed by the abbot of Dundrainon, and contains many curious particulars relating to the kingdom of Northumberland. Henry archdeacon of Huntingdon lived in the reigns of Henry and king Stephen, to the end of whose reign he has brought down his history, which is very defective in method, and interlarded with fabulous stories transcribed from Geossiey of Monmouth. Ealred, Aethel∣red, or Aldred, abbot of Rievesbury in Lincolnshire, was educated in Scot∣land, with Henry son to king David, and wrote the life of Edward the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essor, the history of the battle of the Standard, and the genealogy of the kings

Ralph Diceto, dean of St. Paul's, lived in the reign of John, and wrote a chronicle of the British kings, from Brute to Cadwallader, and from Heng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to Harold: he was likewise author of Chronological Abbrevia∣tions, chiefly relating to ecclesiastical affairs, and the Imagines Historiarum, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llection of historical hints, containing a long digression concerning wars between parents and children, and the account of an interview between John of England and the king of France, in the year 1199. Roger Hoveden was chaplain to Henry II. and wrote annals, beginning at the year 732, and con∣tinued down to the reign of king John: he borrowed largely from Simeon of Durham, and the writers that went before him; is confused in his narration; but his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ule is intelli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible, and his work contains very valuable materials. The chro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle of John Brompton, abbot of Scorewall in Richmondshire, begi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with the year 5<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and ends with the death of Richard Coeur de Lion; though far from being a masterly performance, it contains the transactions of the Anglo-Saxon history, collected with great fidelity; and therefore it is considered as an authentic work: there is indeed a mixture of romance and improbability in his book, which was rather the fault of the age than of the writer; and he is justly blamed for his negligence in chronology. John Wal∣lingford, supposed to have been abbot of St. Alban's, wrote a short chronicle of the Saxon and Danish progress in England, which is in the Cottonian li∣brary, though miserably m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tilated and defaced. Gervase, monk of Canter∣bury, who lived in the reign of king John, is said to have been profoundly learned in the British and Saxon antiquities: he compiled a large history of the Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, Saxons, and Normans, from their origin to the reign of John, with an account of the divi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n of Old Britain, its episcopal seats and monas∣teries; the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this work is lost, though the remains, containing the reigns of Stephen, Henry, and Richard, are very valuable. Matthew Paris <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved in the reign of Henry III. and was a monk of St. Alban's: his history b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns with the Conqueror, and is carried on to the author's death, which happened in the year 1299; from thence it is continued to the end of Henry's reign, by William Rishanger, a monk of the same society: his reputation for virtue was so high, that pope Innocent employed him to reform the degene∣rated monks of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lme in Norway; at his return he became so eminent for his parts and integrity, that he was honoured with the friendship of the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in England, and received particular marks of favour and distinction from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Henry, who retained him about his person, to record the transactions as they occurred; informed him of negotiations that were upon the carpet; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him at his court; and, at his intercession, pardoned the university <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, which had fallen under his displeasure.

either on the administration or the king's own private conduct. His work is the best account extant not only of English history, but also of Europe, during the period of which he wrote, and appealed to as such by all foreign writers. This performance in manuscript is now in the king's library at St. James's, and the very same copy which he himself presented to his abbey at St. Alban's. But besides this he wrote the lives of three and twenty abbots belonging to the same convent; though some authors make objections to the authenticity of that work. In the same reign lived Nicholas Trivet, prior of a monastery possessed by Dominicans at London, and son of Sir Thomas Trivet, one of the itine∣rant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bale. Moreri. Leland. Gale.

He was very accurate in his chronology; and though too concise, is a valuable historian.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already observed that Edward I. embarked with his princess at Trapani, and arrived at Acon in Palestine, just as the Saracens intended to besiege that city. Though his troops did not exceed a thousand men, his appearance not only animated the christians, who had been greatly dis∣pirited;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1271<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> but also disconcerted the infidels, who were alarmed at the arrival of a prince already renowned in arms, whose veins were enriched with the same blood which warmed the heart of that Richard so terrible to their fathers. They had already made a lodgment in the suburbs of Acon, which they now abandoned; and Edward began to make preparations to attack them in his turn. He was immediately joined by seven thousand christians, ambitious of serving under his banner; and his own troops being resreshed from the fatigue of the voyage, he marched to Nazareth, at the distance of twenty leagues from Acon, in order to besiege that city. He soon made himself master of the place; and in his return fell into an ambuscade of the Saracens, whom however he repulsed. Then he directed his march towards a body of the infidels en∣camped at Cakcow, whom he charged so suddenly that they were immediately routed, leaving a thousand men dead upon the spot, together with a very valu∣able booty, with which Edward next day returned to Acon. He obtained ano∣ther victory at St. George's; but as these were only advantages gained over inconsiderable detachments of the Saracens, and he found himself too weak to attempt any conquest of importance, he sollicited the government of Cyprus for a reinforcement; and they forthwith granted to the nephew of Richard their old master, what they had denied to the king of Jerusalem. Edward's reputation was already so dissused through the East, that Albaga king of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingford.</NOTE> Tartars, who had conquered great part of Asia, and taken the last caliph in Baldac, wrote letters to the English prince, expressing his esteem and admira∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of his character, and offering to send an army to his assistance.</P>

<P>The Saracens being informed of these particulars, and dreading the consequences of Edward's commanding a numerous body of forces, had re∣co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse to treachery, in order to deprive him of life, in the most base and cow∣ardly manner. Though t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Old Man of the mountain had been taken in his capital by the Tartars, and put to the sword, with all his followers that were found in the place, there still remained an assassin who had been educated un∣der him, and undertook to murder the prince of England. This ruffian was furnished with letters from the governor of Joppa, proposing a negotiation; and by virtue of these obtained admittance to Edward, who conversed with him freely at different times in the French language, which the infidel understood. Having thus secured free egress and regress, he entered the prince's apartment on Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y in Whits<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-week; and the weather being extremely hot, found him sitting on his bed in a loose garment. There was no other person in the room but t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e assassin, who thinking this a proper opportunity to perpetrate his de∣sign, snatched a dagger from his bosom, and attempted to plunge it into the prince's belly. Edward endeavouring to parry the stroke, received a deep wound in his arm; and perceiving the infidel about to repeat his blow, struck him with his foot on the breast so forcibly that he fell upon the ground; then wresting the weapon from his hand, buried it instantly in his heart. The do∣mestics hearing a no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, broke into the room; and one of them, transported with rage and apprehension, snatched up a joint-stool, with which he dashed out the brains of the dead assassin. The wound which Edward had received was the more dangerous as having been inflicted with a poisoned dagger; and the flesh beginning to exhibit signs of a gangrene, he made his will and resigned himself to his fate; but by the extraordinary skill of an English surgeon, the mortified parts were scarified, and the cure completed in little more than a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>2.</NOTE> sortnight. The soldan of Babylon sent ambassadors to congratulate him upon his recovery, and in the most solemn manner to disclaim any knowledge of the attempt. At the same time he proposed terms of accommodation such as Edward could not prudently reject, considering the small number of his fol∣lowers, the vast power of the enemy, and the letters of his father, pressing his immediate return. He therefore received the sultan's ambassadors in an honou∣rable manner, declared that he retained no suspicion of their master touching the attempt which had been made upon his life, and concluded a truce with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes.</NOTE> him for ten years, ten weeks, and the like number of days, that the western christians might have leisure enough to return to their respective countries. This agreement being ratified, Edward set sail at Acra in August, and in Octo∣ber arrived at Trappani in Sicily, where he had formerly embarked. While he stayed at the court of his Sicilian majesty, he received the tidings of his father's decease, as well as of the death of his own son John, in the sixth year of his age. He bore the last with resignation, but appeared extremely af∣flicted at his father's death; and when Charles of Anjou expressed his surprize that he should lament the loss of his father so much more than he seemed to mourn the decease of his own child, he replied, that the loss of a child might be made up, but that of a parent was irreparable.</P>

<P>Though Henry's death happened at a seeming unfavourable con∣juncture, when the heir of the crown was absent, and Richard king of the Ro∣mans
<PB N="573" REF="5820"/>
with his son were now no more, Walter Giffard archbishop of York<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the lords of the council<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> managed affairs with such discretion that no bad consequence ensued. On the morning after the king's death, Edward was proclaimed at Westminster, and afterwards in Guild-hall; and all persons enjoined to keep the peace towards Jews as well as Christians. Not∣withstanding these precautions, the city of London was filled with tumul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and confusion, occasioned by a dispute between the common-council and the populace, about the election of a mayor. The aldermen voted for Philip de Tailleur, and the common people declared they would obey no magistrate but Walter Hervey, a turbulent man, who set up for a demagogue or patron of the poorer citizens. This contention began during Henry's last illness; and both sides repaired to Westminster, by way of appealing to his majesty, whom they disturbed with their clamour in his last moments. The riot was repeated next day; and the common people had actually resolved to plunder and destroy the richer citizens, when, upon Henry's death, Walter de Merton and other members of the king's council went into the city, and compromised the difference, by proposing a new election at St. Paul's Cross, where Hervey was chosen mayor, after he had promised upon oath that he would not oppres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or molest any person who had opposed his elevation. This dispute being accom∣modated, the council gave directions touching Henry's funeral, and before his grave was filled up, ordered the great seal to be broken, while another, purposely made with an alteration in the name, was delivered to Walter de Merton as chancellor. All the noblemen present at the obsequies took the oath of allegiance to Edward; the king's peace was republished, and orders were sent to proclaim them in their respective counties. In about a fortnight after the funeral, the great council of the kingdom was assembled in the new tem∣ple, and the oath administered to all the prelates, noblemen, and freeholders, in England. Those of Ireland swore fealty to Edward before Maurice Fitz-Maurice, the justiciary of that kingdom; but Llewellyn ap Griffith, prince of North Wales, being summoned to appear and take the oath at the ford of Montgomery, declined meeting the commissioners. The chief actor, in all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> these steps that were taken to establish the tranquillity of the kingdom, was Walter Merton the chancellor, who though an ecclesiastic never scrupled to oppose the encroachments of the clergy, when they interfered with the king's prerogative: he had been very active in preventing the mischievous conse∣quences of the disturbance in the city of London, and exerted himself against the provision of the late pope, who had nominated Robert de Kildwarby to the archbishopric of Canterbury, without a canonical election or the consent of the crown; nor would he suffer the bishop of Chichester to enter the king∣dom, after having been absolved by his holiness, because he was accompanied by Amaury de Montfort. He likewife employed his vigilance and conduct in suppressing robbers who infested the country, and in replenishing the king's exchequer by laying a talliage on the cities, boroughs, and towns of the crown demesnes. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Mean while Edward visited Rome, in consequence of an invitation from Gregory X. who attended him to Palestine, from whence he had been recalled to fill St. Peter's chair; and this pontiff now indulged him with the grant of two or three tenths of all ecclesiastical revenues throughout England, to reimburse him for the expences of his expedition. In passing through Italy,
<PB N="574" REF="5830"/>
he was every where received with honours and acclamation. On the frontiers of Savoy he was met by several English prelates and noblemen; and his queen parting from him at Lyon, repaired directly to Gascony, where she was in a little time delivered of a son named Alphonso. His renown excited the envy and emulation of the count de Chalons, who, when he arrived at that city, proposed a tournament, and even defied Edward to a trial of chivalry. The English monarch accepted the challenge, and with his knights, holding the field against all that would enter the lists, obtained the honour of the day; when the count, enraged at his success, converted those feats of dexterity into a real engagement. Some blood was spilt; but the English still maintained their supenority. From Chalons Edward proceeded to Paris, where he was magnificently entertained by Philip king of France, to whom he did homage for Guienne and the other territories which he ought to have possessed in that<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Edward, after a short stay at the French court, set out for Gas∣cony; and Gaston viscount de Bearne, who had rebelled in his absence, fled at his approach to the mountains, to which he was pursued and taken in one of his fortresses. As Edward treated him with great lenity, and allowed him to ride about on his word and honour, Gaston took the first opportunity to make his escape; and being summoned to appear at the court of Gascony held at St. Sever, without obeying the citation, he was condemned in the forfeiture of his towns, castles, and effects, for the use of his majesty. The king en∣tered his country with a body of forces to execute this sentence; and Gaston seeing himself on the brink of destruction, appealed to Philip as lord para∣mount of the province. Edward immediately retired, and by a proclamation forbade any person to injure the viscount or his vassals, until the cause should be determined. The appeal was accordingly heard in the court of France, which decreed, that Gaston should repair to England, and throwing himself at Edward's feet, submit to his majesty's mercy. The king would not act as judge in his own cause, which he referred to the king of France: but Gaston, dissatisfied with the sentence, demanded of the court, that he might be allowed to decide the dispute in single combat with Edward. His insolent demand was rejected; and he continued in a state of outlawry for six years, at the expira∣tion of which he obtained his pardon, and was re-established in the possession<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymes</NOTE> of his territories.</P>

<P>During Edward's residence in Gascony, he engaged in two alliances; one with Peter the eldest infant of Arragon, and the other with Henry I. king of Navarre: they were cemented by contracts of marriage between the chil∣dren of those princes and the king of England, which however did not take effect. Peter's eldest son, contracted to Eleanor daughter of Edward, did not live to the age of puberty: and the king of Navarre dying in the course of the succeeding year, the mother of the young princess destined for the prince of England, carried her to Paris, where she was afterwards married to Philip<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

The pope having summoned a council to meet at Lyon, in order to procure assistance for the christians of the Holy Land, Edward sent agents to the assembly, and when it broke up set out for England. At Montre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l he was visited by Guy de Dam∣pierre count of Flanders, who went thither to meet him, that they might ac∣commodate a difference which, for some years, had interrupted the commerce between the English and Flemings. It had been customary for the kings of
<PB N="575" REF="5840"/>
England to grant pensions to the counts of Flanders, for certain services which those counts undertook to perform: and Margaret the present countess laid claim to the like annuity. Her demand being rejected at the court of Eng∣land, she seized the effects of the merchants belonging to England and Gascony, which happened to be in her dominions; and reprifals were made upon her sub∣jects in England. Severe penalties were enacted against the exportation of wool to Flanders; so that Margaret, finding herself distressed by this prohibition, was fain to sue for an accommodation, and ordered her son to meet Edward at Montreuil for that purpose. The king sent for some of the principal citizens of London to assist at the conferences; and a treaty of peace was concluded on condition that Margaret should relinquish all claim to the annuity, make good the damage sustained by the seizure of the effects belonging to the Eng∣lish merchants; and that some of her chief nobility should be bound for the performance of this engagement.</P>

<P>This affair being settled, and a free trade opened with Flanders, Ed∣ward took shipping for England, and arrived at Dover in the beginning of August. On the nineteenth day of the same month he was crowned at West∣minster, by Robert de Kilwarby archbishop of Canterbury, in the midst of a vast concourse of prelates, nobility, and people, which last were feasted a whole fortnight at the king's expence. Edmund earl of Lancaster, the bro∣ther of Edward, officiated as high steward of England on this occasion, and next day renounced all hereditary title to that office. Alexander III. king of Scotland was present at this solemnity, and did homage for the lands he pos∣sessed as depending on the crown of England. His queen Margaret likewise graced her brother's inauguration, as well as his other sister Beatrix, married to John duke of Brittany: but both these ladies died in a few months after this ceremony; and he sustained the additional affliction of losing his own son Henry. At the coronation, which was extremely magnificent, five hundred horse were turned loose, as the property of those who should catch them. The king was enabled to defray such extraordinary expence, by the tax upon eccle∣siastical revenues granted to him by pope Gregory; but as his exchequer was almost exhausted, his first care, after he had received the crown, was to exa∣mine the state of his own revenues. For this purpose, he appointed com∣missioners of inquest, to make a progress through all the counties of the king∣dom, and not only take an exact information of every circumstance relating to the crown fiefs, but also examine and punish the malversation of magistrates and sheriffs, who had lately abused their authority and oppressed their fellow∣subjects.</P>

<P>That he might take more effectual steps for protecting his people<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 127<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> from such extortion, he summoned a general parliament, in which several excellent laws were enacted for the ease and advantage of the subjects, who were so well pleased with those regulations, that they granted a fifteenth of all their moveables, to pay the debts which the king had contracted in his expe∣dition to the Holy Land. The merchants, out of gratitude for the great care he had taken of their interest in the treaty with Flanders, as well as in freeing them from divers heavy duties and tolls, desired that a tax of half a mark should be laid on every sack of wool, and twice as much upon three hundred skins, and on a last of leather, to be levied for the benefit of the king and his heirs for ever. It was known by the name of the New Custom,
<PB N="576" REF="5850"/>
in contradistinction to that which had been formerly paid, and is said to have been granted by the prelates and nobility, as well as by the merchants of the king∣dom. Towards the latter end of the late reign, the Jews had, by bribing the king's council, been admitted to all the privileges of christian natives: they purchased houses, lands, and manors; sat on juries; enjoyed seisin and ward∣ships of christian heirs, together with the right of presentation to livings. This indulgence raised a clamour among the clergy, and gave great of∣fence to all sorts of people. The king himself was shocked at the scandalous connivance of his father in this particular; and at his desire a law was made in this parliament, rendering Jews incapable of holding fee or freehold; obli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them to wear a mark on their outward garments, to distinguish them from Christians; and prohibiting them, on severe penalties, from lending money<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

As discontent still prevailed among the nobility and freeholders who had been concerned in the late troubles, and subjected to the statute<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1276.</NOTE> called the Dictum de Kenilworth, Edward enquired into the nature of their complaints; and finding that a great number of disputes had arisen from the uncertainty of the time within which they could claim the benefit of that law, he exempted all persons from the imputation of rebellion who had not ap∣peared in arms from the month of April, when his father marched towards Northampton, till the sixteenth day of September in the following year, when the peace was proclaimed in the parliament of Winchester.</P>

<P>While Edward was employed in making these laudable regulations for the good of his subjects, including the clergy as well as the laity; he was summoned, as a peer of France, to the trial of a great cause depending between Robert duke of Burgundy and the count of Nevers, concerning the right of succession to that dutchy; but he sent agents to excuse his non-attendance, on account of the situation of his own affairs in England; and Philip admitted his apology. The pope likewise demanded eight thousand marks, as the arrears of the annual tribute; which were paid accordingly, though Edward was ashamed of this vile acknowlegement, and afterwards proposed to pope Nicho∣las III. that instead of being issued from the exchequer, it might be charged upon some abbeys and priories, which he would endow for that purpose: but the pope perceiving his drift, would not hearken to the proposal, by which he might invalidate a claim to more important demands, when a proper opportu∣tunity<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymer.</NOTE> should occur.</P>

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>When the parliament broke up, Edward resolved to march against Llewellyn, prince of North Wales, who had refused to do homage for his dominions, and seemed bent upon renouncing his dependence upon the crown of England. At the death of Henry, he had been summoned to come and take the oath to the absent king; but he paid no manner of regard to this in∣timation. When Edward arrived, he was again required to do homage and assist at the coronation; but, instead of obeying the order, he demanded satisfaction for some outrages which he said the English had committed upon the frontiers, contrary to the articles of the last treaty. That he might have no pretext for delaying his submission, the king appointed commissioners to examine and ad∣just all matters in dispute, and summoned him again to appear and do homage. He still refused to comply; and, understanding that the archbishop of Canter∣bury intended to excommunicate his person, and lay his dominions under an
<PB N="577" REF="5860"/>
interdict, he had recourse to the protection of the pope, who forbade the metro∣politan to pronounce those censures against him, as he offered to do homage in his own country; for he pretended that he was not obliged to perform that act of submission, except to the king in person on the frontiers of his dominions. Edward was willing to receive it even on these terms, and actually set out for Shrewsbury to meet Llewellyn upon the border, but he being taken ill on the road, the meeting was deferred till another opportunity. That prince was afterwards summoned to appear before the parliament, but he again refused to come, alledging that as the king had always acted as his sworn enemy, he could not trust himself at the English court, but would do homage to the crown in his own dominions, if the king would send thither commissioners to receive it, or in any other neutral country: he even offered to appear at West∣minster, if Edward would send his eldest son, together with the earl of Glou∣cester and the chancellor into Wales, as hostages for the security of his person. The king, incensed at this insolent message, resolved to reduce him to obedience by more effectual measures; and in the mean time, proceeded with the busi∣ness of the nation: but that was no sooner finished, than he began to prepare for an expedition into Wales. In this interval, Eleanor de Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, daugh∣ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> of the late earl of Leicester, being betrothed to Llewellyn, was, in her passage from the continent to Wales, under the conduct of her brother Amaury, taken near the Scilly isles by a corsair of Bristol, and delivered to the king's officers. This young lady was detained in the queen's court; and her brother was confined in the castle of Sherburn, until he was claimed as the pope's chaplain, and removed to an ecclesiastical prison. Llewellyn sent letters to Edward, demanding his bride, and signifying that he would do homage at Montgomery, provided he might have a safe-conduct subscribed by the first noblemen of the kingdom, and an assurance that the king would confirm the articles of the last peace, and amend those that were defective. His insolence excited the indignation of the parliament, which granted a subsidy for enabling the king to reduce him by force of arms. He was, by a sentence of the king's court, convicted of contumacy and rebellion. The military tenants of the crown were summoned to meet the king at Worcester, by Midsummer of the ensuing year; the Marches were guarded, the forts supplied with strong gar∣risons and store of ammunition; and all the subjects of Edward prohibited from holding any correspondence with Llewellyn or his adherents. The arch∣bishop<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Waverl.</NOTE> of Canterbury and his suffragans renewed their threats of excommu∣nication and interdict, which were actually published against him in the begin∣ning of next year. Roger de Mortimer was appointed commander of all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>277.</NOTE> forces in Herefordshire, Salop, and the adjacent Marches; while William de Beauchamp earl of Warwick, and Pagen de Chaworth, who commanded in Cheshire, were empowered to pardon such of Llewellyn's adherents as should be willing to submit and do homage to the king of England. This was the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se with Rese ap Meredith, lord of Dynevour, who did homage on condition of holding his lands immediately of the crown: his example was followed by all the noblemen of South Wales; and the castle of Stratywy was delivered to Chaworth, who erected another at Aberystwyth for the defence of the country. The king resolved to make an entire conquest of Wales; and that the admini∣stration of justice might not suffer while he should be engaged in this expedi∣tion,
<PB N="578" REF="5870"/>
he removed the court of exchequer and the justices of the bench to Shrewsbury. About Midsummer he invaded Wales, on the side of Cheshire, with a numerous army; and as Llewellyn chiefly depended upon his inaccessible woods and fastnesses, the king ordered a large road to be opened through a long tract of woods, from the Marches as far as Caernarvonshire, that his troops might penetrate with ease into the heart of the country. While the bulk of his army was employed in this work, he erected the castles of Flint and R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thland as he advanced; and then marched forwards to the mountains of Snow∣dun, to which the enemy had retired. Perhaps in that retreat the Welsh prince might have still set him at defiance, could he have screened himself from the attacks of famine; but Edward had not only cut off the communica∣tion by land, between him and any country that could furnish him with provi∣sions, but he was likewise attended by a fleet of the Cinque-Ports, which scoured the sea and reduced the island of Anglesey, from whence Llewellyn had been hitherto supplied. Finding himself thus reduced to the utmost distress, he was obliged to sue for peace, and even to comply with such terms as Edward thought proper to impose. The treaty was concluded at Aberconway, on con∣dition that Llewellyn should pay fifty thousand pounds sterling, by way of satis¦faction for damages; that he should relinquish for ever all the country from Chefhire to the river Conway, and retain the isle of Anglesey as a grant from Edward, for which he should pay a thousand marks annually; that all the Welsh nob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity should swear allegiance to the king of England, except four barons of Snowdun, who continued to hold of Llewellyn; that he should re∣lease all the barons he had imprisoned, and do justice to his own brothers, who had fled from his oppression to the English court; that Llewellyn, with his council, and twenty men out of every cant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in his dominions, should an∣nually swear to the performance of these articles; that ten of the principal no∣bility should be delivered as hostages; and Llewellyn in person do homage to Edward, fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at Ruthland and afterwards at London. This pacification being ratified<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the king remitted the payment of the fifty thousand pounds, and Llewellyn accompanied him to Westminster<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where he took the oath on Christ∣mas<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> day, in presence of the prelates and nobility of England. He failed, however, in coming to the next parliament which was held at Glastenbury, where the king ordered Arthur's tomb to be opened, in order to view the skele∣ton of that renowned monarch; and his absence giving rise to some doubts of his intention, Edward advanced with a body of forces into the Marches. He summoned Llewellyn to Worcester, where he was visited by that prince, who vindicated himself so much to the king's satisfaction, that he restored the hos∣tages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Immediately after this expedition, Edward settled the articles of a con∣tract of marriage between his daughter Joan of Acra and Hartman, eldest son of Rodolphus of Hapsburg king of the Romans: but that young prince died before he was of age to consummate the nuptials. He likewise concluded a treaty of the same kind, between his third daughter Margaret, and John eldest son of the duke of Lorrain and Brabant; a match which was afterwards com∣pleted when the princess attained the age of fifteen. About this period too, Alexander III. of Scotland, renewed his homage to Edward, before the parlia∣ment
<PB N="579" REF="5880"/>
at Westminster, when the Scot professed himself the king's liege vassal, and Robert de Brus earl of Carrick took the oath of fealty in his name. In this assembly the statute of Gloucester, enacted during the Welsh expedition, was confirmed: it was a compendium of some excellent laws, securing the rights and liberties of the subjects, and providing for the better administration of justice. His finances being exhausted, he issued orders to the sheriffs for summoning all persons that held of him by knights service in capite, and pos∣sessed a fee of twenty pounds a year, to come and receive the honour of knight∣hood. As the coin of the kingdom was almost ruined by the practice of clip∣ping, a great number of the Jews, suspected of this crime, was apprehended in different parts of England; and being convicted upon trial, condemned to death. Two hundred and eighty were executed in London, besides those that suffered in other towns of England: their houses and effects were forfeited for the use of the king, who assigned one half of the produce for the mainte∣nance of such as should be converted to christianity. Great sums of clipped money were found in their houses; and the fines paid by those who escaped death, and the goldsmiths with whom they were concerned, must have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Dunst. M.

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>In the midst of these transactions, the county of Ponthieu devolved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edward subscribed to the same renunciation; and, upon giving security for the payment of six thousand livres to the French king, was put in possession of Ponthieu, together with the Age∣nois, and some lands in the Limosin, Perigort, and Quercy, to which he ought to have succeeded at the death of Alphonso count of Poitiers. Having settled the terms of this agreement, and received the homage of his new vassals, he returned to England, to finish his plan of reformation. Great complaints had been made of the excessive wealth of the clergy and convents, which daily increased, to the prejudice of the laity, and indeed of the nation in general. Though care had been taken to insert, in the famous charter of king John, a clause, expresly forbidding the subjects to alienate their lands in favour of the church, this article had been entirely neglected; and now the abuse was become so dangerous, that the king plainly saw the church must in time engross all the lands of the kingdom, unless some remedy could be found for this growing evil. Edward assembled a parliament, to whom he explained his sentiments on this subject, observing, that as the church neither died nor alienated, all their lands would be swallowed up in that gulph, from which they could never emerge: he therefore desired they would deliberate maturely, and find out some remedy for a grievance of such importance. His proposal was joy∣fully received by the assembly; and the famous statute of Mortmain enacted, forbidding all persons whatever to dispose of their effects, in favour of religious societies, without the express permission of the king or lord of the fief. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.</NOTE></P>

<P>Besides this constitution, it was decreed that no person should come to parliament in armour: and John Peckham, nominated by the pope to the see of Canterbury on the promotion of Robert de Kilwarby lately created a cardinal, was called to account for some canons he had instituted at a synod
<PB N="580" REF="5890"/>
in Reading, encroaching upon the king's prerogative. He was summoned before the king's council, and obliged not only to revoke the particular arti∣cles lard to his charge, but also to renounce all other canons that might be prejudicial to the royal prerogative, or interfere with the rights and privileges of the kingdom. This humiliation of the prelate was extremely agreeable to the archbishop of York, who had been long at variance with him, about the ceremony of carrying the cross erect in one another's province; and Henry converted their animosity to his own advantage. He now proposed that they should procure in his favour a fifteenth, for three years, of the revenues of their clergy. York was so well pleased with the mortification to which Ed∣ward had subjected his rival, that he agreed to the proposal immediately; and the other was obliged to comply, lest York should intirely supplant him of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spelman.</NOTE> king's favour. The peace of the kingdom being now perfectly re-established, Edward employed his good offices in compromising the differences that dis∣turbed the tranquillity of his neighbours. He mediated an accommodation between the kings of France and Castile: Rodolph king of the Romans, and Philip count of Savoy compromised their quarrel in consequence of his inter∣position; and he appeased a dispute which his aunt Margaret, queen-mother of France, had with her own son Charles, king of Sicily, concerning her rights<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>At home he made a progress through the different countries, to hear the complaints, and redress the grievances of his subjects; but, in the course of these regulations, he took one step which might have produced in∣finite mischief to the kingdom. During the late troubles, several people had usurped lands, to which they had no lawful title, and the crown had suffered by these appropriations: in order to reform this abuse, the parliament assem∣bled in the course of this year, enacted a statute, called Quo Warranto, obliging all landholders to produce their charters and titles before such judges as should be appointed to examine their validity. This was a very just and necessary regulation, which, however, the king abused for the gratification of his avarice. He knew that among the tenants of the crown, there was a good number of landholders who had lost their titles, and he resolved to take advantage of their misfortune, on pretence of executing this statute Quo War∣ranto. He published a proclamation, commanding all those who held lands of the crown, to produce their titles before the judges of the kingdom; an order which was looked upon as the source of infinite mischief and oppression. Accordingly those who were first questioned, and could not produce original titles, although they pleaded long possession, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound themselves obliged to pay large sums to the king for the preservation of their estates. But the progress of this evil was stopped by the resolution of the earl of Warenne, who being required by the judges to produce his charter, unsheathed an old rusty sword, as the instrument by which his ancestors had acquired their lands, and with which he resolved to preserve them to the last drop of his blood. This bold answer gave Edward to understand, that his inquisition would be attended with very dangerous consequences; and, that the spirit of independency which breathed defiance to his father, was not yet extinguished in the nation. Moved by these considerations, he revoked his proclamation; and the joy manifested
<PB N="581" REF="5900"/>

<P>Mean while prince Llewellyn, impatient of the English yoke, which his people began to find very severe, resolved to withdraw himself from the dominion of Edward, after he had in vain complained of oppression: his sub∣jects were still more eager to renounce their dependence upon a nation they detested; but, thinking it necessary to effect a reconciliation between their prince and his brother David, whom Edward had created earl of Derby, before they would commence hostilities, the Welsh noblemen interposed their good offices. As David had reasons of complaint against the king of Eng∣land, he readily assented to their proposal, and Llewellyn exacted no other condition of him, than an oath that he would never again enter into the service of Edward, but always act against him as the inveterate enemy of his country. This agreement being ratified, David took the field with a body of forces;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> reduced the castle of Harwarden, in which Sir Roger Clifford, justice of the Marches, was found dangerously wounded: then he ravaged the country, and laid siege to the castle of Ruthland. The king, being informed of these hos∣tilities, summoned his nobility and military tenants to meet him at Mid∣summer, in Worcester; he removed his courts of justice from Westminster to Shrewsbury; and, having assembled a numerous army, marched against Llewellyn and his brother, with full resolution to exterminate the whole fa∣mily, and reduce that people to such an abject state of subjection, that they should never be able in the sequel to excite a rebellion of any consequence: what augmented his indignation, was the progress of Rese Maelyon and Grif∣fyth ap Owen, who, with other noblemen of South Wales, had taken several castles, and wasted the lands of the English. At Edward's approach, Llew∣ellyn and his brother abandoned the siege of Ruthland, and retired to the mountains, which were found so difficult of access, that Edward's fury abated; and he allowed the archbishop of Canterbury to treat with the revolters con∣cerning a peace.</P>

<P>That prelate expostulated with Llewellyn upon his having infringed the late treaty; and Llewellyn answered him in writing to this effect: That he was compelled to take arms in behalf of his people, who were oppressed; and that if Edward would now grant him redress of grievances, he would im∣mediately submit, and live in perpetual amity with England. He observed that the king had detained divers lands betwixt the rivers of Dyur and Dulus, and refused to do him justice, unless he would be judged according to the English law, contrary to the stipulations of the last treaty: that the lord Re∣ginald Gray, when appointed justice, had prosecuted the Welsh for trespasses committed in the late reign, notwithstanding the general indemnity to which they were intitled at the last pacification; that Rese ap Maelyon had been un∣justly deprived of his lands and cattle; that the justice had introduced many new customs into the four cantreds held by the king, though his majesty had expressly agreed that there should be no innovation of that nature; that the inhabitants of Anglesey were tried by the English laws, condemned, fined, and imprisoned, contrary to the articles of the peace; that prince Llewellyn was compelled to pay sums to the queen and queen-mother, under the name of Aurum Reginae, which was a grievous imposition; and that when his
<PB N="582" REF="5910"/>
nuptials were solemnized at Worcester, the king obliged him to sign and con∣firm a writing, in which he promised that he would never harbour or main∣tain any person against the incl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nation of Edward; an article by which he might be deprived of his most faithful friends and servants: that the justice of Chester had levied a distress upon his goods, in lieu of a certain shipwreck which he had seized during the late war: that the king's officers, instead of doing justice to the natives of Wales, oppressed and imprisoned them, even out of wantonness of despotism and partiality; and that the articles of the treaty, in favour of himself and his sobjects, were never observed, but in every instance infringed by those who were intrusted with the administration of justice. At the same time David, after having enumerated his important and faithful services to Edward, complained that the king had deprived him of certain towns belonging to the cantreds, which had been bestowed upon him as the reward of his fidelity; that he was obliged to answer suits, relating to Wales, in the king's court at Chester, contrary to the laws of the country; that the justice of Chester had cut down his woods, oppressed his tenants, ex∣ercised an English jurisdiction over the natives of Wales, and neglected his remonstrance, when he demanded satisfaction in behalf of his own people: that he was threatened in the king's court with the loss of his woods, castles, and children; and that in terror of seeing his infants taken away as hostages, and himself condemned to death or perpetual imprisonment, he was fain to have recourse to arms for his own safety. The inhabitants of Ross and Pen∣lyn at the same time presented a list of grievances, including murthers, tres∣passes, and extortion, to which they had been exposed; and Rese ap Vauchan of Stratywy, with several other Welsh noblemen, remonstrated against divers usurpations upon their lands, privileges, and franchises, which the justices had committed under the king's countenance, contrary to the dictates of equity, and the express laws of Wales, which, by the late peace, they were left at li∣berty<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wales.</NOTE> to enjoy.</P>

<P>The archbishop being convinced of the truth of these articles, in∣terceded with the king in behalf of the Welsh, and begged they might have free access to his majesty, and liberty to depart without molestation. Edward told him, he was very well disposed to do justice unto all his subjects; that they should be freely admitted to his presence with their complaints, and al∣lowed to depart, should they appear worthy of that favour. He insisted upon Llewellyn's absolute submission, and proposed the following terms, which the archbishop communicated to the Welsh prince by the hands of Joannes Wal∣lensis: The king will admit of no treaty concerning the four cantreds and the isle of Anglesey: Llewellyn shall submit at discretion; in which case the king will bestow upon him a pension of one thousand pounds, with some county or earldom in England, and make an honourable provision for his daughter: The subjects of Llewellyn shall be treated according to their condition, as the king shall think proper to ordain: If David, brother to Llewellyn, will go to the Holy Land, he shall be maintained by the king, according to his quality; but he shall not return without being recalled. The archbishop exhorted them to embrace these offers, in order to avoid ruin and extirpation; and plainly told them, that, in case of their refusal, he should be obliged to lay them under the sentence of excommunication. To these proposals Llewellyn answered,
<PB N="583" REF="5920"/>
that he was willing to submit upon equitable terms; but that he could not agree to such articles, without laying aside all regard to his own safety, and the welfare of his people, even though he should give up all considerations of honour and convenience. The Welsh noblemen represented, in behalf of their prince, that they would not agree to a peace, unless Edward would admit of a treaty concerning the four cantreds and the isle of Anglesey, the in∣habitants of which durst not submit to the king's mercy, because he had ob∣served no grant, covenant, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, which he had even made with the prince and his subjects; and his officers had always tyrannized over the natives of Wales, with the utmost cruelty. David gave the archbishop to under∣stand, that when he should be disposed for such a pilgrimage, he would visit the Holy Land of his own free will, and not upon compulsion; and that as he had taken up arms in defence of his life and liberty, he trusted that God would fight upon their side against the English, who had wantonly destroyed their churches, profaned their sacraments, slain their priests at the altar, mas∣sacred their countrymen without distinction of age or sex, and even murdered helpless women in the act of suckling their infants. The reader, who is not dazzled by the great talents and prosperity of Edward, will plainly perceive from this detail, that he had injured and oppressed this unfortunate people, without the least provocation or shadow of justice, and connived at the out∣rages of his officers, that the Welsh might be driven to despair and rebellion, which would furnish him with a pretext for reducing them to slavery and subjection.</P>

<P>Llewellyn's answer was no sooner brought to the archbishop, than<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

It does not appear, however, that his endeavours were attended with his usual success. In the course of this campaign he was worsted in several skir∣mishes, with the loss of many persons of distinction; and, in the autumn, having returned to the castle of Ruthland, he issued writs for convoking two extraordinary councils, and the same number of synods, in the south and north of England, in order to deliberate upon more effectual means for carrying on the enterprize which he had undertaken. Mean while he marched with a great army towards the isle of Anglesey, and passed the river Conway on a bridge of boats: then his forces were transported, by the fleet of the Cinque-Ports, to the island, which immediately submitted to his dominion. From hence he caused another bridge of boats to be laid across the river Menay to the continent at Bangor; and, before this was completed, three hundred men at arms, under the command of lord William Latimer and Lucas de Thony, passed over to signalize their courage against the enemy. As soon as the tide flowed in beyond the end of the bridge, the Welsh poured down from the mountains with hideous out<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries, and attacked them in such a manner that they were immediately routed, and either killed, or d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owned in the river. Fifteen knights, two and thirty esquires, and about a thousand common sol∣diers perished upon this occasion; indeed not one of the whole detachment escaped but lord William Latimer, whose horse swam with him across the channel. The English were so disheartened at this de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat, that they neither finished the bridge, nor proceeded with any other operation in that quarter.

<P>Llewellyn and his adherents were so much elevated with the ad∣vantage they had gamed at the bridge, that they began to think heaven had declared in their favour; and that this prince was the person pointed out by one of the prophecies of Merlin, as the restorer of Brute's empire in Britain: a soothsayer had also prognosticated that he should ride through the streets of London with a crown upon his head. Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ridiculous circumstances had great weight with a superstitious people, who persuaded Llewellyn to leave his brother David for the defence of Snowdun, and hazard a decisive battle against the English. With this view he marched into Radnorshire, and, passing the river Wye, encountered a body of forces, commanded by Edmund Mortimer and John Giffard: Llewellyn himself, attended by one esquire, had withdrawn from his army, to confer with some lords of that country, who had promised to meet him in a private valley; and, in his absence, the troops which he had posted at the bridge of Orewyn, were attacked and defeated by the English. The prince, in returning to rally his men, was killed by Adam de Francton, who, without knowing Llewellyn, ran a spear through his heart; but after∣wards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edward sent it immediately to London, where it was received with uncommon de∣monstrations of joy: the citizens carried it through Cheapside, upon the point of a lance, decorated with a silver circlet or crown, in order to fulfil the pre∣diction of the soothsayer; then it was placed in the pillory, that the inhabi∣tants might glut their eyes with such an agreeable spectacle; and afterwards, being crowned with a chaplet of ivy, it was exposed on the highest part of the Tower of London.

<P>The Welsh were so dispirited at the death of their beloved prince, that they made very little resistance against the forces of Edward, who, hav∣ing finished the bridge over the river Menay, penetrated into Snowd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, where the castle of that name, and several other fortresses, were immediately re∣duced. David, who assumed the title of prince upon his brother's death, endeavoured to renew the war, and recover the principality; but the same superstition that formerly animated his followers, now contributed to their des∣pondence: they either deserted his cause, or served with fear and reluctance; so that they were easily defeated; and David being abandoned, was obliged<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch 1283.</NOTE> to conceal himself from the pursuit of his enemy.

His bowels were burned, his quarters exposed in the chief cities of England, and his head was placed upon the Tower, by that of his brother Llewellyn. Im∣mediately after David was taken, Rese ap Vaughan, a nobleman of South Wales, and all his adherents, surrendered to the earl of Hereford, and were committed prisoners to the Tower of London. Edward built two strong castles at Aberconway and Caernarvon; the whole principality of Wales sub∣mitted to his sway, and received the English laws; and then making a pro∣gress<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

<P>The parliament, at Acton-Burnel in Shropshire, granted a consider∣able aid to defray the expence of this war; and here also was enacted the statute known by the name of the place, enabling merchants to recover their debts by recognizances, in the three great cities of London, York, and Bristol: but the ordinances for the incorporation of Wales with England were made at Ruthland, which was the place of the king's residence during this whole expedition. He divided North Wales into counties, and appointed sheriffs and other officers, such as administered justice in England; but he decreed, that the Welsh should not be sued for debts and trespasses, except in their own country. He erected Ruthland, Caernarvon, Aberystwith, and other towns, into corporations, and endowed them with privileges to encou∣rage trade, and allure the Welsh from their mountains into a more sociable way of life, that they might reap the sweets of industry, which would soon divert their attention from schemes of war and rebellion. He published a proclamation, offering peace and security to all those who would put them∣selves into his protection. He left them in possession of the same lands and liberties they had enjoyed under their own princes; but with respect to the bards, who kept up the spirit of their countrymen by rehearsing the glorious deeds of their ancestors, he ordered them to be put to death, without mercy, as the sowers of sedition: another instance to prove how little Edward was re∣stricted by the ties of justice and humanity, when they chanced to interfere with his ambition. Notwithstanding all these precautions of indulgence and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1284.</NOTE> severity, he could neither reconcile the Welsh to his government, nor tame them into quiet subjection: they could not bear the thoughts of obeying a foreign prince, and seeing their antient laws and customs abolished in favour of new regulations, which they did not understand, imposed upon them by a people whom they detested as their inveterate enemies. Edward, in order to flatter their vanity, and amuse their superstition, is said to have left his queen to be delivered in the castle of Caernarvon; and afterwards to have presented young Edward, the fruit of that delivery, to the Welsh lords, as a native of their country, who could not speak a word of the English language. How childish soever such an expedient may seem to the unprejudiced reader, it might have succeeded very effectually, in those days of ignorance, among a people who were swayed by such trifling considerations, even in affairs of the greatest importance. They considered this young prince as a native of Snow∣dun, who would govern them as a distinct people from the English, as the

king's eldest son Alphonso was still alive; but they were soon deprived of this hope by the death of that prince, in consequence of which Edward became heir apparent to the crown of England.

<P>Having taken proper measures for preserving the tranquillity of Wales, he repaired to Bristol, and restored to its citizens the charter which they had for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited by invading the rights of the constable of the castle. About<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This prince accepted of the pope's present, in the name of his son, and began to make great preparations for invading Arragon. He not only invited Edward to join him in this expedition, but also sum∣moned him as duke of Guienne. The king of England did not approve of the pope's assuming a power to dethrone princes; besides, he lived on terms of friendship with Peter, and had contracted an alliance with him touching a match between their children. He foresaw that his possession of Guienne would have become very precarious, should Arragon have fallen into the hands of the French king; he therefore refused to embark in the expedition. Nevertheless Philip earnestly desired a conference; and Edward had proceeded as far as Canterbury, in his way to France, when he was overtaken by a mes∣senger with the news of his mother's illness: he forthwith returned to visit her at Ambresbury, and sent an apology to Philip, who afterwards renewed his<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r.</NOTE> sollicitations; but he could not prevail upon Edward to undertake the voyage. The king having passed the Lent in devotion at St. Edmundsbury, returned to London, which he entered in triumph: but the citizens had no great reason to rejoice at his arrival; for he deprived them of their charter and mayor, and appointed a guardian, by whom they were ruled for ten years successively. The reason assigned for this deprivation, was the mayor's con∣niving at the fraud of a certain baker; though this is such a frivolous pre∣tence, that we must look for another cause, which, in all probability, was the inveterate grudge that the king bore to the city, from his earliest youth, on account of its attachment to the earl of Leicester, and the insults which his mother sustained from the inhabitants. Immediately after Easter he held a parliament at Westminster, in which some antient charters were exemplified and confirmed, and the statute of Westminster I. with some others, was in∣troduced as a law into Ireland. At the next meeting, a fortnight after Mid∣summer, several provisions were made to enforce the statute of Gloucester; amend and confirm laws which had lain dormant during the troubles of the kingdom; prevent the alienation of lands belonging to monasteries; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrect s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndry abuses, mentioned in these regulations, which are known by the name of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tute of Westminster II.

<P>While Edward thus exerted the abilities of a wise legislator, Philip king of France assembled an army of one hundred thousand horse and foot, and entering Roussillon, reduced Perpignan and Elna; while Peter, unable to cope with him in battle, acted upon the defensive, by guarding the passes, and endeavouring to cut off the enemy's convoys. Gironne, which Philip<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1286.</NOTE> invested in the latter end of June, was valiantly defended by Raimond de Car∣dona for ten weeks, during which the French army was ruined by the exces∣sive heat and scarcity of provision; for the place was at too great a distance from the sea, for the besiegers to be supplied by their fleet, which lay at anchor in the bay of Roses. This fleet being divided into two squadrons, one of them was encountered at sea by Marquet, the admiral of Arragon, who took thirty of the French gallies; and the other was surprized and ruined in the bay of Roses by Doria, who commanded the other division of the Arrago∣nian fleet. As the French could no longer subsist in Catalonia, and Philip himself was attacked by a dysentery, he retired to Roussillon, and died at Montesquiou, after having lost a great number of men in this retreat; during which he was continually harrassed by Peter, who did not, however, long survive his success; for he died in November, and was succeeded in his two kingdoms of Arragon and Sicily, by his two sons Alphonso and James. Philip the Fair succeeding to his father's crown, found himself engaged in a double war with Arragon and Castile: he had but just attained the age of seventeen, and being desirous of possessing in quiet the kingdom of Navarre, which he enjoyed in right of his wife, he sollicited the mediation of Edward king of England towards a peace with those two potentates, who were allied to the English monarch. Edward accepted the office of mediator, sent pro∣posals of accommodation to both kings; conferences were immediately begun, and the king having settled the affairs of the nation, in a parliament held immediately after Easter, set out for Paris about the middle of May, leaving the guardianship of the kingdom in his absence, to his cousin Edmund earl of Cornwall. He soon concluded a truce between the powers at war; and, in consideration of his good offices, Philip indulged him with an exemption for life, from all penalty and forfeiture on account of appeals, from himself or his ministers, to the court of the French monarch, to whom he now did homage for the territories he possessed in that kingdom. A new treaty was ra∣tified, confirming the last which had been concluded at Amiens: and then, repairing to Guienne, he convoked an assembly of the states, to make some wholsome regulations for the advantage of a country, which had lately mani∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted uncommon zeal for his service, in contributing both troops and money towards the conquest of Wales. Nevertheless, his gratitude to the Gascons did not prevent his putting to death the ringleaders of some turbulent indivi∣duals of Bourdeaux, who had entered into a conspiracy for surrendering that city to the French king. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrrel.</NOTE></P>

Understanding that the regulations of the statute of Winton were utterly neglected; that the roads were as dangerous as ever, from the insolence of robbers who preyed upon their fellow-subjects with impunity; and that the want of civil policy was owing to the privileges of the barons, who interrupted the course of justice, and would not suffer cri∣minals to be pursued through their territories; he appointed a new kind of justiciaries, immediately dependent on the royal authority, and empowered to administer justice in all parts of the kingdom, to which their commissions ex∣tended. These were granted to certain knights, in every county of England, in order to keep the peace, and take care that the statute of Winton should be duly observed: and the sheriffs were directed to assist them with the posse, if necessary, to execute their orders and warrants.

<P>Mean while a rebellion was raised by Rese ap Meredith, a power∣ful nobleman in South Wales, who had served the king in the late war against his own countrymen. Edward had knighted him for his valour and fidelity, which he promised to reward more effectually with the grant of certain lands and preferments. This promise was never performed, and Rese became of consequence a malecontent; yet he did not express his disgust, until he was summoned to appear in the king's court, by Payne Tiptoft, warden of the king's castles, in that country. Meredith resented this citation, which was contrary to the antient privilege he enjoyed: a quarrel ensued, and several skirmishes were fought, with various success, to the great annoyance of the neighbourhood. The king, apprised of these disputes, wrote a letter to Rese, commanding him to desist from such violent measures; but, instead of obey∣ing this order, he surprized divers castles, and reduced several towns to ashes. Then the earl of Cornwal summoned the military tenants of the crown; and, marching into Wales, made himself master of Drostan, the strongest fortress belonging to Rese, who retired to the woods, from whence he made incur∣sions into the adjacent country, and, falling upon detached parties of the English army, by surprize, destroyed such a number of men, that the earl of Cornwal was glad to conclude a truce, and return with disgrace from a very expensive expedition. Meredith, however, without regarding this agreement, renewed his depredations, until lord Robert Tiptoft assembled a body of forces, with which he routed this Welsh nobleman in the field, and then set a price upon his head; so that, finding his life unsafe in his own country, he with∣drew himself into Ireland, where he resided upon the estate of the earl of Glou∣cester, who in private had connived at his practices. After having resided four years in that kingdom, he returned to Wales, where he was discovered and apprehended among the mountains; then he was conveyed to the king at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. T.

<PB N="589" REF="5980"/>
At length Alphonso agreed to release Charles, provided he would relinquish Sicily, Rhegio, the tribute of Tunis, and procure a revocation of all the mea∣sures which the court of Rome had taken to the prejudice of the house of Ar∣ragon. This treaty was condemned and declared null by pope Honorius IV. who died in the course of this year. He entertained sanguine hopes from the armament of the count d'Artois, who had formed the design of recovering Sicily, and actually invaded that island: but his attempt proved very unsuc∣cessful; his fleet was surprized, and the greatest part of it taken by Doria, and his forces were obliged to retire with great loss to Italy. The see of Rome was, after a year's vacancy, filled with Nicholas V. who desired the king of Eng∣land to procure the enlargement of Charles, before the treaty should be exe∣cuted. For this purpose, Edward proposed that the prince of Salerno should<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1288.</NOTE> be set at liberty, on giving his own three sons and those of forty noblemen in Provence as hostages, together with security for seventy thousand marks and the delivery of Provence, in case he should not perform articles, or fail of re∣turning within three years to his confinement. Edward not only proposed this expedient, but also took a journey to Iacca in Arragon, in order to facilitate the treaty, which was at last ratified; and then Charles obtained his liberty. But he paid very little regard to the agreement; for he no sooner arrived in Italy, than he was absolved of his oath by the pope, and crowned king of the two Sicilies, which he endeavoured to conquer by force of arms, in direct violation of the treaty. When summoned to return to his confinement in Arragon, he marched to the frontiers of that kingdom, at the head of an army, in order to evade his promise: but another treaty was afterwards concluded, with the con∣sent of the pope, on condition that Alphonso should not assist his brother James king of Sicily; and that Charles should renounce all claim to the kingdom of Arragon. This accommodation was followed by the death of Alphonso, just when he was about to marry Eleanor the daughter of Edward; and the king∣doms of Arragon and Sicily being united under his brother James, the prince of Salerno found it a very difficult task to execute his designs upon the last of these realms. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward was so much engrossed by his schemes on the continent, that he seemed to look upon England as a secondary consideration. He had now resided in Guienne about three years, during which he had expended con∣siderable sums of English money upon the continent; at length his finances being exhausted, he ordered the bishop of Ely his treasurer to demand a sub∣sidy; and a parliament or great council of the nobility, being assembled at Westminster, he signified the king's pleasure: but the earl of Gloucester, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Edward, startled at the peremptory refusal of his nobility, thought it high time to return to England, which he found in great confusion, occasioned by the injustice and oppression of the judges and officers of the crown, while the nation was exposed to the depredations of armed banditti, who set the laws at defiance.

<P>Having performed this act of reformation in behalf of the peo∣ple, he, in two parliaments convened after the feasts of St. Hilary and Easter, enacted some laws for the advantage of the nobility: these were contained in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 1290.</NOTE> the statute of Westminster III. They secured to lords paramount their rights in the marriages, wardships, and escheats of their vassals, of which they had been long defrauded by the practice of feofments. He likewise passed the Quo Warranto, establishing all the liberties which had been allowed in the preced∣ing reign, enjoyed from time immemorial, or expresly contained in charters. The manner of levying fines was regulated on this occasion; and Edward, in order to conci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate the affection of his subjects, and consult his own interest at the same time, published a proclamation for banishing all the Jews for ever out of the kingdom. They had rendered themselves equally odious to the English, by their usury and by their religion; they were ordered to quit the kingdom on pain of death, before the first day of November; and in the mean time, all their effects were confiscated to the king, except as much money as would defray the expence of their voyage to the continent. He furnished them likewise with a safe-conduct, in contempt of which they were plundered by the seamen of the Cinque-Ports of the pittance they still possessed; and of fifteen thousand who obeyed the king's mandate, some hundreds were drowned out of mere wantonness of inhumanity. Besides the great sums arising from the confiscation of their effects, the clergy were so well pleased with the expulsion of those enemies to christianity, that they granted a tenth of their benefices to the king, and afterwards joined with the nobility in obliging him with a fifteenth of their temporalities, to make some amends for the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he sustained by the exile of the Jews, from whom he and his predecessors had exacted considerable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> subsidies in the emergency of affairs.</P>

When Edward took the cross in Guienne, the pope immediately declared him general in chief of the crusade; but he was de∣termined against embarking in such an expedition, without a proper fund for maintaining an army equal to the importance of such an enterprize. He de∣manded the tenths of all ecclesiastical revenues of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, to be levied for twelve years, together with all the charitable con∣tributions that should be raised during that period by his own subjects, for the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lief of Palestine, as well as a moiety of what should be collected in the terri∣tories of other princes, who had not engaged personally in the crusade.

danger of being intirely lost, Nicholas V. complied with the substance of his demand; fixed the time of the general embarkation, and issued orders for raising the tenths of the second six years in England. For this purpose, he directed his commissioners to form a new valuation of all benefices, which is called the taxation of pope Nicholas; and was afterwards generally followed in the like assessments. Edward now declared his resolution to set out for Pa∣lestine at the time appointed; but before that arrived, Acra was lost, and the Holy Land entirely conquered by the Saracens: disasters which put an end to all those wild projects of enthusiasm and papal ambition, which had robbed Europe of infinite treasure and an incredible number of men, to the unspeak∣able prejudice of the different countries to which they belonged. But even if<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> those misfortunes had not happened to the christians in Palestine, Edward, in all probability, would have been hindered from embarking in the enterprize, by the troubles of Scotland, in which he was much more deeply interested, and by which his attention was chiefly engrossed during the remaining part of his life.</P>

<P>Alexander III. king of Scotland had died by a fall from his horse, leaving no issue but Margaret, married to Eric king of Norway; and she was daughter to Margaret sister of king Edward. She did not long survive her fa∣ther, and dying left only one child of her own name, commonly called the Maid of Norway. This infant was acknowleged heiress of the crown of Scot∣land in a full parliament of that kingdom, who proclaimed her accession, and appointed guardians of the realm during her absence. Edward projected an union of England and Scotland, by means of a match between his son and this princess, which was agreeable to Eric, and approved by the guardians of Scotland, in a treaty at Salisbury, where it was agreed between the king of England, Eric of Norway, and the Scottish deputies, that Margaret should be sent to Scotland, as soon as the guardians should give security that they would not dispose of her in marriage, without the consent of her father and great uncle. As prince Edward was related to Margaret within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, there was a necessity for obtaining a dispensation from the pope, which was immediately granted upon the king's paying the arrears of the tribute which had been for some years neglected. The guardians and parliament of Scotland sent letters to Edward, congratulating him upon the removal of this obstruction, expressing their earnest desire of seeing the marriage completed, and signifying their resolution of sending deputies to the English parliament, to give their consent to this alliance, and regulate all the measures necessary for carrying it into execution. At the same time they wrote to the king of Norway, desiring him to send his daughter to England with all convenient expedition. Commissioners were appointed to treat with the Scottish deputies; and the treaty of marriage was concluded on the fol∣lowing stipulations: That Scotland should for ever enjoy all its antient rights, liberties, and customs; and the crown revert to the next heirs, free and inde∣pendent, in case Edward and Margaret should die without issue: That Scot∣land should remain separate from England by its established boundaries: That the chapters of cathedral, collegiate, and conventual churches, should enjoy the freedom of election, without being obliged to go out of the kingdom, to ask Conges d'Elire, present their elect, or take an oath of fealty to the king of

Prince Edward constituted the earl of Warenne his proxy, to contract marriage in his behalf with the young queen; and the Scottish deputies engaged to deliver all the castles and forts of their kingdom to Edward and Margaret, and obey them as their king and queen, in all things relating to that country. The two nations seemed extremely well disposed for a union at this conjuncture, after they had lived above one hun∣dred years in uninterrupted friendship; and this marriage would, in all pro∣bability, have been attended with an entire incorporation, had not all these consequences been prevented by the untimely end of Margaret, who died be∣fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> the commissioners arrived in Norway.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1291.</NOTE> The death of this princess produced a dispute about the succes∣sion to the Scottish throne, which exposed that country to ruin and desolation, and even involved England in confusion and calamity. The crown of Scot∣land was claimed by twelve competitors, and the nation divided into as many factions for the support of their different pretensions: the guardians would not presume to decide a dispute of such importance; the nobility in parliament could not agree in their opinions; and the decision by a majority would have been of very dangerous consequence to the kingdom, as the minority would certainly have kindled a civil war in the bowels of their country. After long debates, they unanimously agreed to refer the contest to the determination of the king of England; and William de Fraser bishop of St. Andrews, with some other deputies, were sent to desire Edward would take upon himself the office of arbitrator. He was extremely well pleased with this application, which afforded an handle for establishing a right of superiority over the king∣dom of Scotland, which would extend his dominion over the whole island of Great Britain: a project which, in all probability, he would have attempted to execute, even if this opportunity had not offered. We have already seen, in his conquest of Wales, how little scrupulous he was in point of equity, where his interest and ambition were concerned; and therefore we shall be the less sur∣prized, at his insisting upon a claim for which he or any other prince might

had done homage to his predecessors for their territories, even when they possessed no lands in England. The Scots, on the other hand, affirm that their monarchs never did homage to any king of England, except for lands in Cum∣berland and other parts of England, which they possessed by the same tenure as that on which the English kings had enjoyed Normandy and Guienne on the continent; for with respect to the absolute submission of William during his captivity, it was not only considered as an act upon compulsion, but also relinquished in the most solemn manner by Richard Coeur de Lion. Both<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> sides are guilty of a wilful or involuntary mistake; the English in pretending to a superiority over all Scotland, because it extended over part of that king∣dom; and the Scots in affirming the homage of their kings was payed for Cumberland, whereas in fact it was the Cumbrian kingdom, otherwise called Valentia, extending over the shires of Kyle, Cunningham, Carrick, Renfrew, and Galloway, that antiently depended upon the crown of England. This country, inhabited by Britons, was intirely conquered and reduced by Edmund, who bestowed it upon Malcolm I. king of Scotland, as a fief to be held in fealty of the crown of England, by the service of guarding the Northumbrian territories from the invasion of enemies: Malcolm renewed his oath of fealty to Edred, who succeeded his brother; Edinburgh was granted by Edgar to Indulf king of Scotland; and to this was afterwards added Lothian, compre∣hending the country between the Tweed and the Forth, which Kenneth III. received upon the terms of homage and vassalage to the crown of England. While the father did homage for this accession of territory, his son Malcolm swore fealty to Edgar for the Cumbrian principality, as heir apparent of the Scottish throne; Duncan, grandson to Malcolm II. made the like submission to Canute; and Malcolm III. during the usurpation of Macbeth, found a safe retreat in this Cumbrian kingdom. Thither too Fleance fled for refuge after the murder of his father; and marrying the daughter of one of those British Reguli, transmitted the inheritance of Galloway to his posterity. Mal∣colm did homage to William the Conqueror, though he did not possess one acre of land in England; consequently this submission must have related to the country of Lothian, the grant of which was confirmed to him by that monarch. He afterwards recognized his vassalage to William Rufus; and his successor Edgar, in a charter to the church of Durham, acknowledged that he possessed the county of Lothian by the grant of his lord, William king of England. David I. attended as a peer or vassal of England at the courts and councils of his brother-in-law Henry I. and swore to the succession of Maude the Empress; Malcolm IV. did the same homage to Henry II. with a clause saving his royal dignity; the same homage and fealty was payed and sworn by his brother and successor William, at a time when he possessed no lands in England. We have already mentioned his captivity and submission to his conqueror, of whom he agreed to hold the kingdom of Scotland and all his other territories by liege homage and fealty: from this convention, though ratified by the parliament of Scotland, he was afterwards released by king Richard, who consented to receive his homage as it had been payed by his predecessor Malcolm. He in the sequel swore fealty to John at Lincoln, with the saving clause, which was also retained in the homage done by his successor Alexander II. to Henry III. at Northampton. When Alexander III. solemnized his nuptials at York, he
<PB N="594" REF="6030"/>
was required by his father-in-law Henry to do homage for the kingdom of Scotland; but he refused to make such a concession without the advice and consent of his parliament; and Henry was content to receive it for Lothian and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the other territories which he held of the crown of England. From this short historical deduction, it plainly appears that the English claim too much, and the Scots give up too little; that the kings of Scotland enjoyed their an∣tient dominions in their own right, without vassalage or dependance; and that they derived the possession of the Cumbrian kingdom of Strathcluyd, as well as Lothian, from the grants of English monarchs, on condition of paying homage and service for such concessions.</P>

<P>Edward in all likelihood was very well acquainted with these par∣ticulars, as he had ordered inquiries to be made on this subject, that he might be master of all the arguments and precedents that could be advanced in fa∣vour of his claim; but he depended much more upon the influence of his ar∣bitration, which he knew would enable him to obtain a recognition of his su∣periority from the competitors to the throne and their adherents. In a word, we may safely affirm that he was determined at all events to subdue the whole kingdom to his sway, and for that purpose to manage the different factions into which it was divided. He had already made a conquest of Wales, and the reduction of Scotland would have rounded his dominions. Could he have made himself unrivalled lord of Great Britain, he might with more advantage have prosecuted his designs upon the continent. Actuated by those principles, he convened the claimants and nobility of Scotland at Norham on the river Tweed, where the conferences were opened; and in a general assembly, which met in the parish church, Roger de Brabançon justiciary of England declared to the competitors and Scottish nobility, that king Edward was come to quiet the troubles of their country, to do justice between man and man, and take cognizance of the dispute concerning the crown, by virtue of his own right of superiority over the kingdom of Scotland, which he now required them to ac∣knowledge. They were not a little astonished at this proposal; but being sur∣rounded by a strong body of forces, assembled to overawe their deliberations, they durst not avow their sentiments: though they desired time to consult with the prelates and nobility that were absent, before they would declare themselves on a subject of such importance. Edward told them he expected their answer next day, when they made the same objection; and were indulged with three weeks, within which they were required to prepare whatever they might have to say to the prejudice of his pretensions. This term being expired, they assembled on a plain in the parish of Upset-lynton, on the Scottish side of the Tweed, op∣posite to the castle of Norham, where the king resided. The bishop of Bath and Wells was sent to know their resolution, and demand whether they had any charter or evidence to produce against his claim of superiority and direct do∣minion over the kingdom of Scotland. As they made no answer, he interpreted their silence into consent; and addressing himself to Robert de Brus lord of Anandale, and one of the most powerful of the competitors, asked if he would acknowledge Edward as sovereign of Scotland, and stand to his award in that quality. Robert replied in the affirmative. The same question was put to Florence count of Holland, and John Hastings, who replied to the same pur∣pose; then Patrick Dunbar earl of March, William de Ross, William
<PB N="595" REF="6040"/>
Vescy by proxy, Robert de Pinkney, and Nicholas Soules, appeared severally to claim the crown of Scotland by the right of succession; and agreed to abide by the decision of Edward, as lord paramount of that kingdom. John Baliol was absent; but, at the request of his proxy, the meeting was adjourned till next day, in the church of Norham, where he joined the other competitors in signing a recognition of Edward's superiority. The king of England was well acquainted with the merits of the cause, and knew very well that the contest would be between Brus and Baliol; but, in order to keep these candi∣dates dependent upon his will and subservient to his views, he encouraged and in all probability raised up the other competitors. He naturally concluded that no individual among them would preclude himself from all hope of suc∣cess by disobliging the arbitrator of his cause; but, lest any one or all of them should prove refractory, he had prepared a very strong body of militia to extort their concession; and when the Scottish nobility seemed to boggle at his pro∣posal, he swore by St. Edward that he would venture his life in the prose∣cution of his right, which he pretended to demonstrate by irrefragable proofs, which were no other than a collection of exploded fables, extorted deeds of submission, and monkish forgeries. The pains he took to support his claim<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chr. Abingd.</NOTE> betrayed the weakness of his pretensions. He could not produce one authentic voucher, except the submission of William during his confinement, which Richard relinquished in the sequel. His sovereignty being thus acknowleged by the competitors, including John de Cumin, who at this meeting gave in his claim, which was admitted among the rest; it was agreed, by the no∣blemen and prelates of both nations, that he should be enabled to execute his sentence, by granting the kingdom to him who should appear to have the best right; and for that purpose it was determined that he should be put in possession of all the fortresses in the kingdom. This was a strain of complaisance which must have been inspired by the most abject fear, or the most servile flattery, after he had publicly declared that although he acted in this dispute as lord paramount of Scotland, he did not mean to desist from his own pretensions to the crown of that kingdom; but reserved to himself the liberty of prosecuting his rights in such manner and at such time as he should think proper to adopt. How disagreeable soever this acknowlegement must have been to the body of the Scottish nation, they were obliged to submit to the transaction: all their nobles were either cajoled by the promises or intimidated by the threats of Edward; and his troops hovered about the borders, ready to fall upon their country, should they manifest the least tendency to opposition. Nevertheless the regents thought it was incumbent upon them to obtain some sort of satisfaction for the people; and demanded letters patent from Edward, declaring that the dispute should be decided within the kingdom of Scotland; a favour which he readily granted, at their humble request, considering their demand as a fur∣ther acknowlegement of his sovereignty. These previous measures being taken, they resolved to proceed to the examination of the claims; and the com∣petitors agreed that forty persons should be named by Robert de Brus, as many by John Baliol and John Cumin, and four and twenty by king Edward, to investigate the different pretensions of the claimants, and make their report to the umpire, after having duly considered the circumstances of the dispute. The commissioners being chosen, the town of Berwick was pitched upon as the place of meeting, and the time limited to the second day of August. But,
<PB N="596" REF="6050"/>
before they quitted Norham, the regents of Scotland and the governors of the castles surrendered their commissions to Edward, who restored them with some little alteration, and appointed the bishop of Caithnes high chan∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or of the kingdom, associated with one of his own secretaries called Walter de Hamondesham. Orders were issued for all those who enjoyed posts in Scotland to come and take the oath of allegiance to king Edward, who in the mean time exacted it from the competitors and all present; and then repair∣ing to Berwick, even before the commissioners assembled, he published a de∣claration, importing that although he had consented to the succession's being decided within the kingdom of Scotland, he did not mean to restrict him∣self to the same condescension on any future occasion. The commissioners meet∣ing at the appointed day, in presence of his majesty, received the claims of the different competitors; but, as the chief contest lay between Baliol and Brus, we sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l wave the pretensions of the others, and only observe that the first of these pretended to the crown, as son of Devergild the eldest daughter of Mar∣garet, the first born child of David earl of Huntingdon, brother to king Wil∣liam, whose posterity was extinct in the person of the last queen Margaret. Robert de Brus alledged that he was in a nearer degree of consanguinity, as being the grandson of David, whereas his competitor was no more than the great grandchild; that Alexander II. had declared him his successor, in case he should die without issue; and that Alexander III. had always looked upon him as his presumptive heir; a circumstance that he could prove by the evi∣dence of several persons who had heard him explain his sentiments on that sub∣ject. The different claims being read and reported, by the commissioners to the king, he, with the consent of the competitors, prorogued the assembly to the month of June in the succeeding year, when he proposed they should pro∣ceed<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>This recess was owing to the death of Edward's mother, who was interred at Ambresbury with great solemnity, the king in person attending her funeral, with all the prelates and nobility of the kingdom. The fifteenth granted at the expulsion of the Jews having been levied only in those parts of England which were immediately subject to the crown, commissions were issued for assessing it upon the counties palatine of Cheshire and Pembroke, the principality of Wales, and the estates belonging to the English nobility in Ireland. At the same time all who possessed forty pounds a year in land were summoned to come and receive the honour of knighthood at Christmas. Gil∣bert earl of Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester had lately erected a castle on the lands belonging to Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford, who complaining of this injury in the king's court, Edward reserved the cognizance of the cause to himself, and forbade the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rties to violate the peace of the country. Notwithstanding this injunction, Gilbert's vassals invaded Humphrey's territories in Brecknock∣shire, with banner displayed, and ravaged the country. These depredations were retorted by Humphrey's tenants; abundance of bloodshed ensued, and the whole neighbourhood was exposed to the calamities of civil war. The king issued a special commission for inquiring into the facts, which were as∣certai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by a verdict of jurors: and the inquest being returned to his majesty, the two earls were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmoned to Ambresbury to answer for their contempt<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<PB N="597" REF="6060"/>
custody, and their liberties seized into the king's hands. They were dismissed however upon giving bail for their appearance; and the cause being tried be∣fore the council, the king pronounced sentence, by which the liberties of Gla∣morgan and Brecknock were forfeited during the lives of the earls, who were sent to prison till ransomed at the king's pleasure. Hereford compounded for a thousand marks; but Gloucester, having been found the aggressor, was obliged to give security for paying ten times that sum before he could procure his liberty. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the decision of this affair, Edward made a progress through Suffolk, Norfolk, and other northern counties; and in the beginning of June arrived at Berwick, where the prelates and nobility of both kingdoms were assembled, with the commissioners, for examining the claims of the com∣petitors. At the very beginning of this session, the ambassadors of Norway demanded the crown for their master, as heir to his own daughter Margaret; and his claim was admitted among those of the other pretenders, after they had in their king's name acknowledged Edward's right of sovereignty over Scotland. As the examination of such a number of claims was attended with tedious disputes and disquisitions, which protracted the determination of the cause, the king proposed that they should begin with the pretensions of Brus and Baliol, without prejudice to those of the other claimants, which should be afterwards discussed; but warm debates arising among the commissioners, about the laws and customs, according to which the dispute should be determined, Edward adjourned the assembly to October, when they unanimously agreed that the judgment ought to be regulated according to the laws and customs prevailing in the king's dominions; and that the kingdom of Scotland should be considered as an indivisible fief. Then Brus and Baliol were asked if they had any thing further to say in behalf of their respective claims, which they endeavoured to corroborate by several plausible arguments and explanations. These being discussed, the king proposed the following question, "Whether the more distant issue of the eldest, or nearer offspring of the second daughter, ought to be preferred?" And the commissioners unanimously answered, that according to the laws and customs of both kingdoms, the descendant of the eldest was preserable to the other. After this decision, Edward ordered them to canvas the point in his hearing, and then declared he would give judgment on the sixth day of November, when he solemnly pronounced the claim of Robert de Brus defective; but as the exclusion of this competitor did not as∣certain the title of Baliol, he ordered the examiners to take cognizance of the other pretenders. The contest between Baliol and Brus being determined, John Hastings alledged that Scotland as a fief was divisible; and therefore ought to be divided among the three descendants of David earl of Hunting∣don, whose youngest daughter was his mother. He was seconded in this claim by Robert de Brus, who now demanded a third part of the kingdom, as son and heir of the second daughter. Edward again demanded of the com∣missioners, whether or not Scotland was an indivisible fief; and they answering as before, he adjourned the assembly to the seventeenth day of the month, when summoning all the competitors to appear and justify their pretensions, the ambassadors of Norway, Florence of Holland, William de Vescy, Dunbar, Ross, Pinkeney, and Soules, withdrew their claims; John Cumin was non∣suited, because he did not appear; and the king pronounced that John
<PB N="598" REF="6070"/>
Hastings and Robert de Brus had no title to any share of the kingdom of Scotland, which was a fief indivisible. Baliol therefore standing without com∣petitor, was declared king of Scotland, though Edward reserved to himself and his successors the right of prosecuting their own pretensions. Orders were immediately issued for putting him in possession of the kingdom; and he took the oath of fealty, acknowledging the sovereignty of Edward and his succes∣sors over Scotland, in the most explicit and submissive terms, enacted into an authentic constitution: then he was installed at Scone with the usual forma∣lities; and all the noblemen of Scotland swore allegiance to him, except<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reg.

<P>The king of England seemed impatient for an opportunity to manifest that right of sovereignty which he had been at such pains to establish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1293.</NOTE> While he resided at Newcastle, a burgher of Berwick complained of an injury he had received from certain English officers, who had been sent upon some commission to Scotland; and he ordered the cause to be tried before his own judges in England. The council of Scotland, alarmed at this arbitrary in∣junction, sent deputies to remind him of his promise and engagement, by which he was restrained from evoking Scottish causes before the tribunal of any other kingdom. To this remonstrance he replied, that he could not allow such a suit to be tried before any judge but himself, as it did not become vassals to correct the faults of those who represented the person of their sove∣reign. In order to anticipate such complaints for the future, he sent a decla∣ration to the council of Scotland, giving them to understand, that although, while their throne was vacant, he had made some occasional promises, which were performed, he did not mean to be restricted by those condescensions, now that they had a king of their own; nor to depart from his right of judg∣ing all affairs that concerned their kingdom, at any time or place that he should think proper. He expressed himself in the same terms at his own court, in presence of Baliol and many noblemen of both nations; and, more∣over, declared his intention of sending for the king of Scotland into England, as often as he should deem his presence necessary or expedient. He pro∣nounced these words in a transport of passion; so that Baliol did not think proper to expostulate upon the subject with a prince of his imperious temper: but, in a few days, he had another opportunity of exercising his patience; for Edward obliged him to renounce, by an authentic deed, for himself and his successors, all the promises, concessions, and ratifications, made by the king of England, during the vacancy of the Scottish throne; and to approve of all the steps he had taken in that period. This bitter draught, however, he sweetened by granting letters patent, in which he relinquished all other right but that of homage to the crown of Scotland; and gave up for himself and his successors, all claim to the wardship of minors, as well as the prero∣gative<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Public.</NOTE> of marrying them, according to his pleasure. These were not all the instances which Edward exhibited of his design to exercise his right, in its ut∣most extent, over the kingdom of Scotland. A merchant of Gascony pre∣sented to him a memorial, in which he represented that Alexander, the last
<PB N="599" REF="6080"/>
king of Scotland, was indebted to him for a sum of money, which the new king refused to pay; and therefore he had recourse for justice to king Edward, as lord paramount of Scotland. In consequence of this petition, Edward summoned the king of Scotland to appear in person, and answer the charge of the merchant, before his court at Westminster. In a few days after this cita∣tion, Baliol received another, on account of Macduff earl of Fife, who had been imprisoned for seizing some lands unjustly, by order of the first parlia∣ment assembled at Scone, after John's elevation to the throne: he was no sooner set at liberty than he preferred his complaint to Edward, and Baliol was summoned to appear at a certain time and place. In the month of June, he was a third time cited upon the following subject: the king of England had ordered Walter de Huntercombe, governor of the isle of Man, to put Baliol in possession of that island; but afterwards a lady called Austriga, claimed possession as heir at law, and her pretensions being rejected, she ap∣pealed to Edward. David king of Scotland had formerly granted to the mo∣nastery of Reading, a priory dependent on the bishopric of St. Andrew's, which was afterwards alienated by the abbot of Reading, in favour of the see which had been dismembered: a succeeding abbot pretended the alienation had been made without the consent of the monks, and presented a petition to the king, desiring it might be restored. The bishop appealed to the pope; and his appeal being admitted at the court of Scotland, the abbot complained to Edward, who summoned Baliol to appear before him personally, fifteen days after Martinmas. In the course of the succeeding year, that prince was again ordered to appear before the king of England, to acquit himself of the charge of having refused to do justice to the bishop of Durham, in an affair relating to his diocese. From such a series of citations, upon the most frivo∣lous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1294.</NOTE> occasions, Baliol comprehended that Edward's design was to render him a slave rather than a vassal: but as he was in no condition to shake off his de∣pendence, he found himself obliged to obey those orders, and answer in person for the misdemeanours laid to his charge. When he was accused before the English parliament of having unjustly imprisoned the earl of Fife, he proposed to answer by proxy; but he was not allowed that privilege, and appeared at the bar as a private subject. He then pleaded, that as he acted from the right of regality, in that affair for which he was now summoned before the king, he could not make a defence without having previously consulted his subjects: this plea was over-ruled, and the parliament ordained, that three of his best castles should be seized by the king, and kept until he should have given ample satisfaction. Baliol, however, prevented this sentence, by acknowledg∣ing the direct sovereignty of Edward over Scotland, and humbly petitioning for time to consult his own parliament. His request was granted, and a day being fixed for his appearance, he withdrew full of indignation and chagrin. Edward's aim in humbling the king of Scots, was, in all probability, to provoke that prince to a revolt, which would furnish him with a pretence to subdue the whole kingdom, and seize the property of it into his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Baliol resolved to take the first opportunity of freeing himself from such a shameful and slavish dependence; and he derived hopes from a rupture, which about this time happened between France and England.
<PB N="600" REF="6090"/>
This took its rise from a petty quarrel between a few mariners of each nation, which afforded a pretext to the French king to summon Edward to his court of peers, to answer for the hostilities committed on the natives of France, by his subjects. Edward, apprehensive of a war, immediately detached John de St. John to defend Guienne; and, at the same time, sent his brother, Edmund earl of Lancaster, to Paris, with full powers to treat of an accommodation. Philip insisted upon satisfaction for the affront he had received, in the persons of his officers, who had been maltreated in Guienne. A private treaty was brought on the carpet, for a marriage between the king of England and Margaret of France, daughter of the late king Philip the Hardy. By the articles of this alliance, it was stipulated that the son of this marriage should, after his father's decease, enjoy Guienne for himself and the heirs of his body; and, that if he should die without issue, the country should revert to the crown of England. As these articles could not be executed without a new feofment of that dutchy to Edward for life; and for the uses specified, after his decease, it was neces∣sary that the French king should have seisin of the whole province. The marriage-contract being signed and ratified by Edward, and the king of France having promised, on the word of a king, to observe all the stipulations, the earl of Lancaster sent orders to the governors of Guienne to put him in pos∣session of the whole dutchy. After all the towns and fortresses had remained forty days in his custody, restitution was demanded, together with a safe-con∣duct for Edward, that he might go over and complete the marriage: but Philip refused both the one and the other; and, as the king of England had not obeyed the citation, he was pronounced contumacious, and judgment given against him by default. This judgment, however, was waved, as being founded on a citation which had been annulled; and Philip issued an∣other, requiring Edward to appear at Paris in three weeks after Christmas.</P>

<P>The king of England, incensed at the perfidious conduct of the French king, instead o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obeying the summons, renounced the homage he had paid on the footing of former treaties, and resolved to recover, by force of arms, the territories which Philip had so treacherously usurped. For the more easy accomplishment of this end, he engaged in alliances with his own sons-in-law, Henry count of Barre and John duke of Brabant, Amadeus count of Savoy, Adolphus of Nassau, king of the Romans; the archbishop of Cologne, the counts of Guelderland and Catzenellenbogen, and some noblemen of Burgundy, who promised to make a diversion in the provinces of France: Guy count of Flanders likewise undertook to invade the French domi∣nions; and he himself began to prepare a fleet to transport his own army to the continent. In order to defray the expence of this armament, an addi∣tional duty was laid upon merchandize in England and Ireland; the prelates and clergy, in a convocation at Westminster, granted a moiety of all their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat.

<P>The natives of that country, driven to despair by the heavy taxes with which they were saddled, ran to arms; and, seizing the collector, hanged him, with some of his followers: then they ravaged the country, mas∣sacring all the English who fell in their way. These revolters were headed in South Wales by one Morgan, in West Wales by Maelgun Vaughan, and in North Wales they were commanded by Madoc, a kinsman of their beloved prince Llewellyn. Morgan drove the earl of Gloucester out of the country; Maelgun over-ran Cardigan and Pembrokeshire; Madoc surprized Caernar∣von, made himself master of the castle, and afterwards reduced Snowdun and Anglesey. The earls of Lancaster and Lincoln were detached into North Wales, with part of the forces intended for the expedition into Gascony; and, having advanced as far as Denbigh, were attacked and defeated. Edward, alarmed at this insurrection, marched thither in person; and, after divers ren∣counters with the Welsh, who fought desperately, compelled them to retire to the mountains of Snowdun, to which the king penetrated, even in the winter season. Madoc was then obliged to quit his post, and try his fortune in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> Marches, where he obtained the advantage in several skirmishes; but, being at last routed on the hills near Caurs castle, he submitted to Edward, and was sent prisoner to the Tower of London. His example was followed by almost all the Welsh barons, who were imprisoned in different castles. The rest of the rebels were pardoned: but Edward declared that he would extir∣pate the whole race, should they ever excite another rebellion. He ordered the town and castle of Beaumaris to be rebuilt, great part of the woods in the inland parts to be cut down; and, erecting some fortresses on the sea-coast, returned in the latter end of July to London. Morgan still continued in arms in the county of Glamorgan, which held of the earl of Gloucester, who had rendered himself so odious to the natives by his pride and tyranny, that the Welsh noblemen refused to obey his superiority, though they offered to submit on condition of holding their lands of the crown of England. They were accordingly, with their leader Morgan, indulged in this respect, laid down their arms, took the oath of allegiance, and delivered hostages for their fidelity.</P>

<P>The king, when he set out on the Welsh expedition, had sent over a body of forces to Guienne, under the command of his nephew John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, assisted by John de St. John, Robert de Tibetot, and other experienced officers. They sailed up the river Garonne, and were received into Blaye and Bourg, which having secured with garrisons, they passed by Bourdeaux, occupied by the constable de Nesle, and landed at Rions, which with St. Macaire submitted without resistance: then they ex∣tended their quarters along the Dordogne, and were joined by almost all the barons of the country.

Philip's intention was to invade England, that he might co-operate with John Baliol, who had already engaged in a league offensive and defensive with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t monarch, to be cemented by a marriage between Jane, daughter of Charles de Valois, and Edward, son to John Baliol. In order to fac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tate the success of the projected expedition, the French king had con∣tracted with Eric king of Norway, for two hundred gallies, half that number of transports, and fifty thousand land forces; but this treaty was never executed.

On his ar∣rival at London, he addressed himself to the ministry, and undertook to dis∣cover
<PB N="603" REF="6120"/>
the designs and weakness of the French government. He told his tale so plausibly, that he was admitted to several private conferences with Edward; but, in the midst of this communication, his correspondence with the enemy was detected, and he died the death of a traitor. The king, determined to pro∣vide<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Westmon.</NOTE> against this threatened invasion, summoned a parliament to meet at West∣minster, and issued writs for the representation of cities and boroughs, which were never regularly represented before this period. At this assembly he de∣manded a subsidy to carry on the war against France; and a considerable sup∣ply was granted both by the clergy and the laity. The pope had offered his mediation for a peace or truce between the two nations; and two cardinals were sent over with proposals for a cessation of hostilities, to which, however, Edward would not agree without the concurrence of his allies on the continent: yet he sent ambassadors to Cambray, where conferences were opened under the mediation of the legates; but their endeavours did not succeed. Edward equipped a fleet of three hundred and fisty sail, for the transportation of seven thousand foot and a body of horse, under the command of his brother Ed∣mund, accompanied by Henry de Lacey earl of Lincoln. They set sail from<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1290</NOTE> Plymouth in the beginning of March, and landed at Bourg and Blaye, on the river Garonne, where, being joined by a good number of Gascons, they en∣camped within a league of Bourdeaux, which was still possessed by the enemy. In a few days after they had occupied this post, the garrison made a general sally, in which they lost two thousand men: but, Edmund being too weak to besiege the place in form, he withdrew his forces from that neighbourhood, reduced Langon, recovered St. Macaire, and marched to Bayonne, where dying of a lingering d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stemper, the chief command devolved to the earl of Lincoln; but nothing of consequence was transacted during the remaining part of the campaign. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this time Edward had received intimation of the league between Philip and Baliol, which last had, by means of his ally, obtained from pope Celestine, an absolution from the oath of homage he had taken to the king of England. John, together with Robert de Brus, and the earls of Marche and Buchan, had, by repeated messages, been required to send succours to Edward as vassals of his crown; but they neglected to comply with these orders, and John did not attend at the English parliament. The king of England, wil∣ling to be more certified of Baliol's intentions, demanded the castles of Berwick, Roxburgh, and Jedburgh, by way of security for his behaviour, so long as the war with Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce should continue; but John evaded the proposal, without rejecting the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mand. Then he and his nobility were summoned to a parlia∣ment convoked at Newcastle upon Tyne; and, as they neither appeared in per∣son, nor sent an excuse, Edward was fully convinced of their dissatis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action, and resolved to attack them without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urther delay. He had already appointed the rendezvous of his military tenants at this place, and issued orders <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or levy∣ing forces in Wales and Ireland, to assist in the Scottish expedition. While he was employed at Newcastle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assemb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g his forces, the guardian of the Cor∣deliers at Roxb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh, brought a letter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liol, complaining of the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peated injuries he had r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ward, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cing his d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen∣dence upon the crown of England.

his castle for Edward. A thousand men being detached to reinforce the garri∣son, were intercepted in their march by Robert, at the head of some Scottish troops, and entirely defeated. The king was no sooner apprized of this action, than he advanced with his whole army, amounting to five and thirty thousand men, and encamped at Werk, from whence he proposed to march into<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> Scotland after the Easter holidays. Mean while an army of Scots, commanded by the earls of Buchan, Monteith, and several other noblemen, invaded England; and having made an unsuccessful attempt upon Carlisle, returned to Scotland, to oppose the progress of Edward. That prince passing the Tweed at Cold∣stream, invested the town of Berwick; and the fleet of the Cinque-Ports enter∣ing the harbour, were so warmly received by the enemy, that, after an obsti∣nate engagement, they were obliged to retire with the loss of several vessels. The king, perceiving the smoke of the burning ships, ordered the assault to be given; and the Scots were so astonished at the valour of the assailants, that they made no defence, but suffered themselves to be slaughtered without oppo∣sition. The Scottish historians affirm, that Edward was repulsed in several at∣tacks, and at length had recourse to stratagem: that he withdrew his army as if he had meant to raise the siege; and provided banners and ensigns like those that were displayed by the Scottish kings and nobility; that he ordered his sol∣diers to wear S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Andrew's crosses above their armour, a mark by which the Sects distinguished themselves in battle; then returning suddenly, those who belonged to the faction of Bruce advanced before the rest, and told their coun∣trymen, that king John was come with an army to their relief. The people and garrison crediting this information, ran out in crouds to meet their sovereign; when a detachment of horse cutting off their retreat, and seizing one of the gates, they were cut in pieces before they could put themselves in a posture of defence. The English army immediately entered the town without opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and massacred above seven thousand men, women, and children. The English writers agree in the account of this carnage, which was made under the eye of Edward himself, not much to the credit of his humanity.</P>

<DIV4 N="41" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLI.</HEAD>
<P>While he stayed in this place to put it in a posture of defence, the Scottish army entered Redesdale, and ravaged Northumberland as far as Hex∣ham, burning churches and convents, and committing other acts of barbarity; but they soon retreated to their own country, upon hearing that the king of England was upon his march to give them battle. The reduction of Berwick laid all the lowlands of Scotland open to the incursions of the English; for, be∣tween this place and Edinburgh there was no other fortress but that of Dun∣bar, belonging to the earl of Marche, who was in the service of Edward. This nobleman was an adherent of Robert de Brus, son of Baliol's competitor, who died in the course of the preceding year. Edward, knowing the animo∣sity that subsisted between these two families, had, by this time, engaged Bruce in his interest, by an offer of the crown which he intended to wrest from Baliol; and the influence of this nobleman, attached the most powerful barons of Scotland to his service. The nobility that adhered to John Baliol, knowing the importance of Dunbar, prevailed upon the wife of Patrick earl of Marche to deliver up the fortress into their hands, and supplied it with a strong garri∣son to retard the progress of the English. Edward, being informed of this transaction, detached the earl of Warenne with a strong body of forces to
<PB N="605" REF="6140"/>
besiege the castle, which was gallantly defended for some time, until the besieged, finding themselves unable to withstand the vigour of the assailants, demanded a cessation of three days, within which they might make their king acquainted with the nature of their situation; and they obliged themselves to surrender the fort, provided he should fail to march to their relief. Baliol, having assembled a numerous army, resolved to hazard an engagement rather than give up a castle of such consequence; and, on the third day of the truce, he appeared in sight of Dunbar, at the head of forty thousand men. Warenne immediately advanced, and attacked them with such impetuosity, that the Scots were routed with great slaughter, and fled beyond the Forth, leaving all the southern parts to the mercy of the English. Dunbar immediately surrendered at discretion; and the castles of Jedburgh and Roxburgh followed the example of this garrison.</P>

<DIV4 N="42" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward detached Robert de Brus, and his son of the same name, to receive the submission of the barons of Annandale and Carrick; while he himself, advancing at the head of his army, reinforced by five and forty thou∣sand men from Wales and Ireland, reduced the castles of Edinburgh and Stir∣ling, and then marched to Perth, where he gave audience to the agents of John Baliol, who implored his mercy in the most abject terms of submission. Anthony Beck bishop of Durham was directed to treat with him at Kincar∣din; and as he assented to every thing that was proposed, his submission was performed in the church-yard of a place called Strickathroe, where he appeared meanly mounted upon a sorry horse, with a white rod in his hand, before Ed∣ward, who received him with ineffable contempt. Then he professed his sor∣row and penitence, for having engaged in a league with the king of France against his liege lord, whom he now besought to forgive him for his folly; and renounced his French alliance, in the name of himself, his son Edward, and all the subjects of Scotland. An instrument, containing the terms and manner of this submission, was sealed and authenticated by the nobility then present; and, as if this humiliation had not been sufficient, Baliol repeated it in the castle of Brechin, where he resigned his person, crown, dignity, and private estates, into the hands of the conqueror, who sent him under a guard to England. The great seal of Scotland was now broken, as being of no further use; though another, with the English arms, was made and delivered to Walter de Agmon∣desham. The king appointed Hugh de Cressingham treasurer, W. de Or∣mesby justiciary, Henry Piercy warden of Galloway, and John de Warenne, earl of Surrey, guardian of the kingdom. Edward having proceeded as far north as Murray, and finding the country quiet and submissive, returned by the way of Scone, from whence he carried off the famous stone chair on which the kings of Scotland used to be placed at their coronation; and this precaution, trivial as it may seem to be, contributed in a great measure to tame the people to the English yoke; for the chair was implicitly and universally believed to be the palladium of their monarchy. At the same time he ordered all the records of the kingdom to be taken away or destroyed, that the Scots might have no monuments of their former independency. Having thus finished the conquest of that kingdom, he marched back to Berwick, where he convened the pre∣lates, nobility, freeholders, with the deputies of the royal boroughs and other communities of the realm, who renounced the alliance with France, did ho∣mage
<PB N="606" REF="6150"/>
for their lands, swore fealty to the king of England as their lord para∣mount, and subscribed an authentic deed, specifying all these articles of their sub∣mission. Edward having subdued Scotland, and secured the tranquility of that country by prudent regulations, disbanded his forces, and returned to the southern parts of his dominions, accompanied by John Cumin of Badenogh, and some other S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottish noblemen, whom he thought proper to detain as prison∣ers of war until his dispute with France should be decided.</P>

<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>As this expedition had been very expensive, and Edward had remit∣ted great sums to support the war in Gascony, he assembled a parliament at St. Edmundsbury, where he received a considerable supply from the laity; but met with an absolute refusal from the clergy, who pleaded a late bull of pope Boniface, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orbidding them to grant subsidies to princes without the pope's l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cense, and prohibiting all sovereigns from levying such supplies, on pain o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> incurring the sentence of excommunication. This bull had been ob∣tained by the interest of Robert de Winchelsey archbishop of Canterbury, with the concurrence of the English clergy, that they might be protected from all taxation. Edward, equally inoensed and astonished at their refusal, adjourned their meeting till January, that they might have time to deliberate upon his demand, and form their final resolution on the subject. Mean while the king's daughter Elizabeth was married to John the young count of Hol∣land, Zealand, and Friesland; and the nuptials were solemnized at Ipswich. Guy count of Flanders having been released from his confinement in France, renewed his treaty with Edward, who agreed to supply him with a considerable subsidy, that he might be enabled to levy a strong body of forces, with which he intended to invade the dominions of Philip. It was likewise stipulated that prince Edward should espouse the count's daughter Philippa. The other con∣federates, whom he had formerly engaged, continued still staunch to his in∣terest; but as they could not be retained without repeated subsidies, he ex∣pected with impatience the next meeting of the clergy, in hope of finding them well disposed to relieve his necessities. But, instead of receiving a favourable answer at their convocation, the archbishop of Canterbury told the king's com∣missioners, in the name of his brethren, that they had two superiors, namely the pope and the king; and though they were bound to obey both, yet they owed the greater obedience to his holiness, as their spiritual lord and master. Edward was not a prince to be treated in this manner with impunity: he re∣solved to be king in his own dominions without any competition; and he looked upon the power of the pope as an impudent usurpation, which none but weak princes would endure. He thought those who disclaimed or endeavoured to depre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the royal authority, did not deserve its protection; and that none should enjoy the benefit of the laws, except those who contributed to relieve the ne∣cessities of the government. In these sentiments he sent orders to all the sea∣ports, to prevent any person's leaving the kingdom without his special license; then he withdrew his protectior from the cle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gy, by a declaration published in all his courts, and seized all their lay <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees, goo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and chattels: but this seve∣rity extended no farth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r than the province of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terbury, because the clergy of York had alre d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complied with the king's demands, and obtained a par∣ticular w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of protection. The recusa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts were now reduced to a deplorable condition: their effects were seized, and their revenues sequestred; they were
<PB N="607" REF="6160"/>
disabled from suing at law, while they themselves lay exposed to suits and all manner of outrages and indignities, without having any right of recovery or redress. Winchelsey derived fresh obstinacy from prosecution: he ordered the pope's bull to be published in all the churches of his province, and convened a synod of his su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fragans at St. Paul's in London; but Edward issued a writ, inhibiting them from enacting any constitution to the prejudice of the king, his ministers, or faithful subjects: they were, in a particular manner, forbid to publish the sentence of excommunication against any person on pain of im∣prisonment; and Ither de Engoulesme archdeacon of Bath appealed, in the king's name, to the pope against their proceedings; an expedient which ef∣fectually suspended their operations. Finding themselves cut off from all re∣medy but that which they might expect from Rome, and seeing all their goods confiscated in a solemn manner by a parliament or convention of the nobility, they were obliged to sue for protections, which they did not obtain without<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Even these compositions were not sufficient for the purposes of the king, who was pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by his allies to cross the sea; but, as he could not put his army and auxil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aries in motion without considerable supplies in money, and saw no other way of raising it in his dominions, he seized and sold for his own use, great quantities of wool and leather, bought up by the merchants for ex∣portation; and exacted two thousand quarters of corn, besides other provisions, from every county in the kingdom, for the subsistence of his troops in Gas∣cony. Though he promised to reimburse the proprietors of the wool when he should find it convenient, these arbitrary measures excited an universal dissatis∣faction over the whole country. Under Edward they produced complaints; but in the reign of a less resolute prince, they would have been attended with rebellion: not that his barons were totally degenerated from the spirit of their fathers; he had occasion to perceive their fortitude and resolution at this very period. In order to execute his projects on the continent, he assembled a par∣liament at Salisbury, to regulate the proportion of troops which every baron should furnish for the expedition. His aim was to make a powerful diversion in Guienne by his subjects, while he himself should press the enemy on the side of Flanders: but he found his noblemen unwilling to serve in any place where he did not command in person. Each individual excused himself from going abroad, though he did not refuse to contribute his proportion of men for the service. Edward, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qued at their excuses, threatened to give their lands to others who should be more obedient. These menaces gave great umbrage to the nobility: Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, great constable of the realm; and Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, great mareschal, told him plainly they were ready to accompany his majesty, but would not serve except where he himself should be present. Edward, incensed at this declaration, exclaimed in a transport of anger, <Q>“By the eternal God! you shall either go or be hanged.”</Q> The earl of Norfolk replied in the same strain, <Q>“By the eternal God! I will neither go nor be hanged;”</Q> and he and Hereford retired that same day from parliament, attended by a numerous body of armed men, who seemed to set his majesty at defiance. When they arrived in their own terri∣tories, they would not suffer the king's officers to collect the duties on wool or
<PB N="608" REF="6170"/>
leather, or take any thing by way of purveyance: they even expelled those<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> collectors from their lands, and prepared for an open insurrection.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLV.</HEAD>
<P>Edward had seen such instances of union and perseverence among the barons in his father's reign, that he did not chuse to risk his glory and repose upon the issue of a war with his own subjects: besides, such a dispute at this juncture would have disabled him from prosecuting his revenge against Phi∣lip king of France, or complying with the earnest request of his ally the count of Flanders, who pressed him to cross the sea with all possible expedition; he therefore dissembled his resentment against the constable and mareschal, though he soon found an opportunity to deprive them of their offices. The king sum∣moned his nobility, and all who possessed twenty pounds a year in land, to rendezvous on the first day of July at London, with horse and arms, in order to accompany him to Flanders. Amongst others the earls of Hereford and Nor∣folk were required to appear by particular mandates. The constable came in person; but the earl of Norfolk excused himself on account of sickness, and sent John de Seagrave as his proxy. It was resolved in council, that a procla∣mation should be issued for mustering the forces next day at St. Paul's: though this was properly the business of the constable and the mareschal, they refused to do their office; and the king bestowed their employments upon Tho∣mas de Berkley and Geoffrey de Geyneville. The earls published a manifesto, justifying their conduct, and representing the grievances of the nation in the burden of taxes, the poverty of the subject, the intrenchment on franchises, and the neglect of Magna Charta, as well as of the assize of the forest. Edward took the pains to answer this memorial; and, conscious of the influence of the clergy, reconciled himself to the archbishop of Canterbury, in an assembly of the nobility and people at Westminster. He excused the taxes laid upon them for the maintenance of wars, in which he had been unavoidably engaged for the advantage of his country, and the recovery of his own inheritance: he as∣sured them, on the word of a king, that he would redress all their grievances on his return from abroad; but in case he should die in that expedition, he conjured them to preserve their fidelity to his son Edward, whom he left under the care of archbishop Winchelsey and Reginal de Grey, whom he appointed regents of the realm in his absence. This metropolitan, and some of his suffra∣gans, having undertaken to compromise the difference between his majesty and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>contented earls, proposed a conference at Waltham, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which place the constable and mareschal sent their deputies, alledging that they did not think it safe to appear in person. Safe-conducts were granted, but they still declined the interview. Edward found means to revenge himself partly on Hereford, by releasing Ralf de Monthermer, who had married Jane countess of Glou∣cester without the knowlege of the king her father. He had been imprisoned at Bristol for that offence, but now was set at liberty, and invested with the honour of Gloucester, that he might watch the motions of Hereford, and fall upon him at once, if ever he should presume to excite commotions on the Welsh March<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>

<P>These precautions being taken, he embarked at Winchelsey for Flanders: and that very day the earls of Hereford and Norfolk appeared at the bar of the exch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, accompanied by a great number of knights and ban∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erets; where alter having complained of the subsidies lately granted, and the

duty and price of wool, as intolerable grievances, forbade the barons to levy the eighth granted by the boroughs without the king's knowledge, and de∣manded redress of the other hardships under which the nation laboured. This eighth had been granted by the cities, boroughs, and towns, of the royal demesne, without the concurrence of the earls, barons, knights, and commu∣nity, of the kingdom; and therefore the earls objected to it as a practice tend∣ing to the disherison of them and their heirs. The king being made acquainted with this remonstrance, declared, by proclamation, that the taxation of the eighth should not be drawn into a precedent; that though necessity had obliged him to seize upon the wool, for the common safety of the realm, he would refund the value to the proprietors; and he assured his people that such methods of raising money should not be practised for the future. Had the sums<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham. Rymer.</NOTE> so raised been employed for the defence or advantage of England, he might have been excused for such an act of despotism; but as they were immediately applied for the purposes of a foreign war, with which the interests of England ought to have had no connection, the king could not expect that his subjects would pay much regard to his declaration. The English had been harrassed, without intermission, since the beginning of his reign, in executing the pro∣jects of his ambition, from which they reaped nothing but disaster. The war with France was a gulph that swallowed up the lives and substance of the nation. He had, indeed, acquired glory in his conquest of Wales and Scotland; yet this was but an unsubstantial recompence for the blood and treasure he had lost in those two expeditions: nor was the reduction of those countries so com∣plete, but that he had reason to expect continual revolts, insurrections, and incursions, which would expose the conquerors to perpetual alarms, danger, and expence. The Scots had already begun to make efforts for the recovery of their freedom. Earl Warenne, guardian of that kingdom, disliking the climate, had retired to the north of England; and a few Scots, who had fled to the mountains from the arms and sovereignty of Edward, took this oppor∣tunity to retrieve their independence. They were headed by William Wallace, the younger son of a gentleman who lived in the western part of the kingdom. He was a person of gigantic stature, incredible strength, and amazing intre∣pidity: his character was unblemished; his heart glowed with the sentiments of liberty; and all the virtues of heroism were united in his character. Such is the portrait of Wallace, drawn by the historians of his own country; where∣as the English writers represent him as a robber and an outlaw. Nor is there any difficulty in reconciling these accounts. Wallace thought he had a right to commit depredations upon the enemies of his country; and the English very naturally considered him as a rebel and a robber, who disturbed the established government, and attacked their possessions without immediate pro∣vocation. He was without question outlawed by the administration; and per∣haps the greater part of those who at first attached themselves to his fortune, were people who had incurred the censures of the law, and fled from the exe∣cution of justice. His first exploits were confined to petty ravages, and occa∣sional attacks upon the English officers and detached parties, in which he ac∣quired such reputation, that in a little time his band was considerably aug∣mented by those who, like himself, were fired with the love of independence; as well as a good number of persons provoked by the insults and oppression they had sustained from Ormesby, the justiciary, who was a man of an arbi∣trary
<PB N="610" REF="6190"/>
and imperious disposition. Wallace thus reinforced, formed a plan for surprising this minister at Scone, where he usually resided; and though his person escaped with great difficulty, all his effects, together with the adjoining country, were left as a prey to the enemy, who being about this time joined by Sir William Douglas, began to grow important and formidable. The bishop of Carlile, and some lords of the Marches, alarmed at this commotion, sum∣moned Robert de Brus the younger, to come to that city and renew his oath to Edward; and he not only complied with the citation, but even wasted the lands of Douglas, in return to his own country of Carrick.</P>

<P>The king of England being informed of this insurrection, or∣dered the earl of Warenne to raise the military force of the northern counties, and attack the Scots, who had by this time crossed the border, and begun to ravage the country. Warenne being old and infirm, sent his grandson Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, with an army of forty thousand men, into Anandale, where they surprised the Scottish forces, who being inferior in number, capitulated, and promised to give hostages for their future fidelity. Richard de Lundy, upon this occasion, went over with his followers to the English army; and Robert de Brus, who had, notwithstanding his late oath at Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, joined his countrymen with James Steward of Scotland, was among the number of those who submitted. Mean while the earl of Warenne, with another army, advanced into Scotland against William Wallace, who lay with his forces advantageously posted in the neighbourhood of Stirling, on the other side of the river Forth. Hugh Cressingham, the treasurer, a man of a proud, insolent, over-bearing temper, pressed the earl to pass the river and attack the enemy; and though Richard de Lundy offered to ford it with a detachment of horse and foot, and keep the Scots in play, until the rest of his army should have crossed by a narrow bridge which was in their front, his proposal was rejected; and the earl Warenne, instigated by the sarcasms of the treasurer, ordered his troops to march along that wooden convenience. When Wallace perceived about half the army passed, he quitted his post, and attacked them with such fury that they were routed and cut in pieces. Hugh de Cressingham, and above five thousand English, were killed upon the spot, besides those who perished in the river; and Warenne retired with the remains of his army to Berwick. Thither he was followed by Wallace, and his col∣league Andrew Murray, at whose approach he abandoned the place, which they entered in triumph; though they could not reduce the castle. From thence they marched to Carlile, which they in vain attempted to reduce; and then ravaged the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland for a whole month, without opposition. This was a very glorious campaign for Wallace, whom his followers had declared regent or guardian of the kingdom. He had, in the course of a few months, reduced almost all the castles and fortresses which the English held in Scotland; defeated their general, and invaded their country; from whence he returned laden with an immense booty, which dispelled the prospect of famine that threatened the people of Scotland, from the neglect of agriculture.</P>

<P>The defeat at Stirling, and the rapidity of success with which Wallace proceeded, struck such a damp into the inhabitants of the northern counties, that there was a necessity for sending thither a reinforcement from the southern parts of the kingdom; but none of those who favoured the earls of
<PB N="611" REF="6200"/>
Hereford and Norfolk chose to engage in this service. The archbishop of Canterbury, and other prelates, considering the danger to which the country was exposed from intestine divisions, at such a critical juncture, exhorted prince Edward to compromise the difference with Hereford and Norfolk: writs were issued for summoning these two noblemen particularly, together with eight lords of their party, and a number of prelates, to consider with the prince upon the present emergency of affairs; and afterwards a parliament was convened for confirming the two charters, agreeable to the king's promise in a late declaration. The earls accordingly appeared at London, attended by five hundred horse, and a great number of armed infantry, and not only insisted upon a confirmation of the two charters, as fundamental constitutions, but also procured a statute, enacting that no talliage nor aid should be levied in the kingdom without the consent of parliament; that no merchandise should be seized for the future on any pretence whatsoever; that the new tax or toll upon wool should be remitted; and that a general pardon should be granted to the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, John de Ferrers, and all their adherents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE> In consideration of these indulgences, the nobility and clergy granted subsidies for the defence of the kingdom; and the earls agreed to march into Scotland, or cross the sea, to serve according to his majesty's direction. Edward con∣firmed and ratified these transactions, and sent orders to the earls and nobility in England, to meet in arms at York, on the twentieth day of January, that they might be ready to march into Scotland. He issued writs for con∣voking a parliament at the same time and place, summoned all the lords of the kingdom to appear personally at that meeting, on pain of being declared ene∣mies to the public; and empowered the bishop of Carlile to grant the king's peace to Robert de Brus, and all his followers who should be inclined to assist at this assembly. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward's expedition to the continent had been very unsuccessful. Philip had engaged the king of Castile and Arragon in his interest. The count de Bar, one of the allies of England, who invaded Champagne, was obliged to surrender at discretion to Jane, queen of France and Navarre. Adolphus of Nassau, and the duke of Austria, were debauched from Edward's interest, by the address and liberality of Philip; and their example was followed by the dukes of Brabant and Luxemburg, and the counts of Guelderland and Beaumont. Then the French king entering Flanders, at the head of sixty thousand men, invested Lisle; while Guy, unable to face him in the field, and depending entirely on the succours from England, employed the duke de Ju∣liers to make a diversion in his favour. Against this general Philip detached the count D'Artois, who coming up with him in the neighbourhood of Furnes, a battle ensued, in which the duke of Juliers was defeated and slain. Guy was so distressed by this defeat, that he durst not stir from Ghent, where he waited for Edward with great impatience and perplexity, arising not only from the strength of his enemy, but also from the factions that divided his country, one half of which was in the French interest. At length the king of England arrived with a body of troops, not at all equal to the importance of the enterprize, and found the city of Bruges in such confusion, occasioned by the different parties, that it was with the utmost difficulty he could appease their animosity, by granting them some particular immunities in their trade with his subjects. The same divisions reigned in Ghent, which, while Edward
<PB N="612" REF="6210"/>
endeavoured to compromise, the king of France made himself master of Lille, Douav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Courtray, and several other towns in the neighbourhood. Then he marched to Bruges, which surrendered without resistance; and he formed a plan for burning the English fleet which lay at anchor at Damme: but his design taking air, they put to sea and avoided destruction. All the measures of Edward were broken by the perfidy of his allies. He had very little as∣sistance to expect from the count of Flanders, the majority of whose subjects was in the interest of France: his own troops were too weak to oppose the progress of the enemy; and the new troubles in Scotland rendered his pre∣fence necessary in his own dominions. In this emergency, he had recourse to the good offices of the king of Sicily and the count of Savoy, who offered their mediation between him and Philip. Conferences were opened, and a truce concluded at Fismes in October, to be in force only for two months: but it was afterwards prolonged for two years, that the pope might have time to adjust the articles of a solid peace, which they agreed to accept upon the terms he should propose. This was accordingly effected in the month of June, when Beniface annulled the contract of marriage between prince Edward and Isabel, daughter of the count of Flanders; and decreed a double march between king Edward and Margaret of France, sister to Philip the Fair, and between young Edward and Philip's daughter Isabel. The damages done before the com∣mencement of the war were ordered to be repaired on both sides: and all the places possessed by the contending parties, in each other's territories, were se∣questrated into the hands of the pope, until all differences should be finally adjusted between them and their respective allies, who were comprehended by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> name in the truce and treaty.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch 1298.</NOTE> While this treaty was on the anvil, the English nobility met in par∣liament at York; but as the Scots, who were summoned to that assembly, did not attend, a rendezvous was appointed at Newcastle for the forces destined to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvade Scotland. There they mustered two thousand men at arms, twelve hundred light horse, and an infinite number of infantry, with which they ad∣vanced to the relief of Roxburgh and Berwick, which were besieged by the Scots, who retired at their approach. It was now the middle of winter, so that they proceeded no farther than Berwick, where they disbanded all their army but fifteen hundred chosen men, and about twenty thousand infantry, and resolved to wait the king's arrival. Edward landed in March at Sand∣wich, from whence repairing to London, he restored the franchises of that city. Then he issued commissions for enquiring into the grievances of his people; and gave orders for convoking a parliament at Carlile, to which the Scottish nobility were summoned, on pain of being declared traitors, and ene∣mies to the public. If we may believe the historians of that country, Edward assembled a multitude of raw troops at his first arrival, and marched directly against Wallace, who had advanced as far as Yorkshire: that coming in sight of the Scottish army, and seeing the excellent order and good countenance with which they waited his attack, he thought proper to retire, without hazard∣ing a battle, until he should have assembled an army on which he could have more dependence. The same writers likewise affirm, that the king sent a threatening letter to Wallace, in which he told him that he durst not have re∣volted in Scotland, much less invaded England, if he himself had not been absent from his British dominions; and that the Scottish guardian replied, it was not
<PB N="613" REF="6220"/>
so base to take the advantage of his absence, to deliver his country from servi∣tude, as it was in Edward to foment divisions, of which he took the advantage to enslave a free people.</P>

<HEAD>§ LI.</HEAD>
<P>The Scottish nobility refusing to attend the parliament at Carlile, Edward appointed the rendezvous of his army at Roxburgh; and in the mean time the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, still diffident of his sincerity, insisted upon his ratifying anew the charters of their liberties; nor would they proceed until the bishop of Durham, with the earls of Surrey, Warwick, and Glou∣cester, swore in the king's name that they should have the satisfaction they de∣manded, at his return from this expedition. He was now fully determined to destroy the Scottish name and nation. He had assembled an army of ninety thousand men, and ordered his fleet to attend him in his march, to supply him with provisions, which he could not expect to find in such a barren country. He invaded Scotland by the west border, and had like to have suffered by the detention of his ships, which were prevented by contrary winds from coming up; so that he had marched three days into the country, and then advanced on the other side of the kingdom, with a view to be supplied by a second squadron, which he had directed to enter the frith of Forth, in case he should find it necessary to change his route. Wallace is said to have harrassed him in his march with a body of light troops; and to have obtained several advantages over detachments from the English army, which was by this time reinforced by the Gallovidians, and Robert de Brus, who envied the guardian's reputation, and seemed to think that he aspired at the crown. Al∣most all the noblemen of that country considered Wallace as an ambitious up∣start, who had acquired a popularity dangerous and disgraceful to their interest and reputation. They looked upon his conduct as a reproach upon their pusil∣lanimity; and all the men of interest and family were either his secret or pro∣fessed enemies. In conjunction with James Stuart, and John Cumin, he had assembled thirty thousand men, and encamped near Falkirk, by the wall of Antoninus. Thither Edward pursued his march, in order to bring them to a decisive engagement: and he found them already drawn up in three separate divisions, each forming a complete phalanx of pikemen, and the intervals lined with archers: their horse were placed in the rear, and their front was secured with palisadoes. Edward having observed the posture of the enemy, ordered the charge to be sounded. And this was answered by the Scots with such a hideous yell, that the king's horse being frightened threw his rider, and afterwards kicked him on the ribs as he lay on the ground: notwithstanding this accident, he mounted again with his usual alacrity, and ordered the Welsh troops to begin the attack. These declining the service, he advanced in per∣son, at the head of another battalion, and the palisadoes being pulled up, charged the enemy with such impetuosity as they could not resist. Wallace seeing him advance, encouraged his men with a short speech, and resolved to sustain the attack on foot. He accordingly behaved with his usual courage, and his troops for some time followed his example: but, in the heat of the battle, the division commanded by Cumin quitted the field, in consequence of their leader's treachery, or a previous quarrel with the guardian about the post of honour; and his retreat leaving Stuart's command exposed, they were surrounded, and cut in pieces to a man. Wallace still maintained the battle, till his pikemen, being galled by the English arrows, began to give way,
<PB N="614" REF="6230"/>
and he found himself in danger of being surrounded: then he was obliged to relinquish the field; and, by the favour of the night, accomplished a retreat, with the remains of his army; leaving a complete victory to Edward, and about twelve thousand of his countrymen dead on the spot; whereas the loss of the English did not amount to one hundred men.</P>

<P>The king, immediately after this advantage, advanced to Perth and St. Andrews, ravaging the country without opposition. Then turning back, he marched through the forest of Selkirk to Anandale, where he reduced the castle of Lochmaban; and from thence continued his route to Carlile, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE> he summoned a parliament to regulate the affairs of Scotland. He had already granted the isle of Arran to Thomas Biset, who had come over with a body of troops from Ireland to his assistance: and at this assembly he gave away, among his followers, the estates belonging to those Scottish noble∣men who continued in rebellion: but, before the meeting of the parliament, the earls of Hereford and Norfolk, dissatisfied with some circumstances of Ed∣ward's behaviour, asked leave, on pretence of fatigue, to return to their re∣spective estates; and the constable died on the last day of the year. When the session broke up at Carlile, the king repaired to Durham, and hearing the Scots were beginning to re-assemble their shattered forces, he passed the Christ∣mas holidays at Tinmouth. Then he proceeded for London, where he held a parliament, in which the pope's award was read and unanimously approved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1299.</NOTE> The two charters were confirmed, together with some other articles relating to the disforesting of certain lands; which he passed, however, with a salvo to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. West.</NOTE> rights of his crown. At this period two friars arrived from France; and de∣manded, in Philip's name, the release of John Baliol, who, since his resigna∣tion, had been kept prisoner in the Tower of London. The French king comprehended him in the number of his allies, and demanded his enlargement by virtue of the late treaty, in which it was stipulated that the allies of each prince should have the benefit of the pacification. Edward alledged that Baliol was his vassal, who had formally renounced his engagement with France, con∣sequently could not be considered as one of Philip's allies. The French agents replied, that the counts of Flanders and Bar, though vassals of the crown of France, had been specified in the treaties; and that the renunciation of Baliol was the effect of compulsion. While this affair was spun out into a negotiation, that contemptible prince was influenced to declare, in presence of the bishop of Durham, constable of the Tower, and a public notary, that he had found so much malice, fraud, treachery, and deceit, in the Scots, while he sat upon their throne, that for the future he would never have the least concern with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> that kingdom or people. Nevertheless, the dispute was left to the decision of the pope, and John was put into the hands of Boniface's nuncio, at Witsand, near Calais, on the express conditions that his holiness was at liberty to decide as he should think proper, touching the person and English estate of the pri∣soner; but that he should not intermeddle in the affairs of Scotland, which Edward wholly reserved for his own cognizance.</P>

<P>The Scots began to breathe after their late disaster. Wallace per∣ceiving how much he was envied by the nobility, and knowing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the interest of his country, had resigned the regency of the kingdom, and humbled himself into a private station; in which, how∣ever, he continued to take all opportunities of annoying the English, at the
<PB N="615" REF="6240"/>
head of a small body of friends, who would not forsake him in adversity. The rest of the Scots, who wished to deliver themselves from the yoke of Ed∣ward, pitched upon Cumin to supply his room; and that nobleman endea∣voured to approve himself worthy of this preheminence. Understanding that a treaty was on the carpet between France and England at Montreuil, under the arbitration of the pope, he sent deputies to Philip, desiring that the Scots might be comprehended in the pacification. The conjuncture was favourable for them, because Edward was impatient to recover Guienne: but all that the French king could obtain was a truce for seven months, in favour of the Scottish malecontents. This was so ill observed by the English; and the people of that country were oppressed and insulted in such a manner, that they were animated by despair, and seemed ready to perish in an attempt to recover their freedom. This spirit was carefully cherished by Cumin, who represented to the barons of his party, that unless they should take some immediate measures for their own preservation, the king of England would reduce them to the most wretched state of slavery; and that they still had it in their power to shake off his yoke, by one generous effort during the winter, when their country was in a manner inaccessible to the forces of England. His remonstrance produced the desired effect. They unanimously resolved to take arms, and withdrew to their several habitations, in order to prepare for a general revolt. Their de∣sign was communicated to all the cities and boroughs in the kingdom, who joined in the conspiracy; and, at the appointed time, the whole nation rose as one man against the English garrisons. These, unable to withstand the rage and enthusiasm of a desperate people, capitulated for their lives, and were per∣mitted to leave the kingdom; and in a few days all the English were expelled, except those that occupied some few of the strongest fortresses, which the Scots were in no condition to besiege.</P>

<P>Edward, who had just consummated his nuptials with Margaret of France, in consequence of the treaty, no sooner heard of these commotions, than he issued orders for assembling the troops of the northern counties, and summoned a parliament at York, to meet in November, where he understood that the castle of Stirling was reduced to extremity. He resolved forthwith to march to the relief of that fortress; but, when he had proceeded as far as Berwick, the nobility refused to serve in the expedition, alledging that the roads of Scotland were unpassble in that season of the year. Thus hampered, he was obliged to desist from the enterprize, and allow the garrison to make the best capitulation they could obtain. He resolved, however, to make such<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Rymer.</NOTE> preparation for invading Scotland in the summer, as would save him the trouble of a winter campaign for the future. Mean while, he in this parlia∣ment confirmed the two charters, and the sheriffs over all England were or∣dered to publish them in the county courts every quarter. It was enacted that three knights should be chosen by the freeholders in every county court, to enforce the execution of these charters, and punish transgressors in a summary way, without the tedious forms of the common law. The statute of Win∣ton was likewise confirmed; and a new law made, under the title of Articuli super Chartas, enacting that no goods or merchandise should be taken with∣out payment, by the king's order, except such as might be necessary for his houshold or wardrobe. This statute likewise contained some regulations with regard to trespasses, contracts, debts of pleas within the verge of the court;
<PB N="616" REF="6250"/>
and provided redress against false entries, seizures, and waste, committed by e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>heators Writs were issued for finishing the perambulations of the forests, that their bounds might be ascertained for ever; and all the adulterated pennies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> of which a vast number had been imported into the kingdom, were cried down by proclamation.</P>

<P>The king having taken these measures for the benefit of his subjects, began to prepare for the final destruction of Scotland; and assembling a nu∣merous<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> army, took the field about Midsummer. As soon as he entered Galloway, he received a proposal from the Scottish nobility, importing that they would lay down their arms, and submit, on condition that he would set their king at liberty, and allow them to ransom their estates, which he had given away; otherwise they would defend themselves to the last extremity. Their requests being rejected with disdain, they assembled a great number of men, without arms or discipline, in hope of finding some opportunity to sur∣prize him in his march; but he proceeded with such circumspection as baffled all their endeavours; and pursued them so closely that they were at last obliged to stand a battle, in which they were immediately routed, though not with great slaughter; for they fled into fastnesses, through which they could not be pursued by heavy-armed troops, unacquainted with the situation of the country. The hopes they had reposed in their own valour being utterly blasted by this overthrow, they sent ambassadors to implore the protection of pope Boniface, and offer him the sovereignty of the kingdom. That ambitious pontiff embraced the proposal without hesitation, and ordering a bull to be ex∣pedited on the subject, sent it immediately with a letter to archbishop Win∣chelsey, directing him to deliver it into the hands of Edward without delay. The prelate no sooner received this mandate of his holiness, than he set out in person for Galloway, and found his majesty in the abbey of Dusques, where he received the papal claim with equal surprize and indignation. The bull contained a great number of arguments to invalidate the pretensions of Edward to the sovereignty of Scotland; reproached him with the cruelties he had committed in the prosecution of the war against that unfortunate country; and, in particular, with his having imprisoned divers bishops still in confinement: it constituted the pope as the proper judge of the difference between the English and Scottish nations; and ordered the king to send ambassadors to Rome with proper instructions, within the term of six months; at the expiration of which he would pronounce a definitive sentence. Shocked, as a prince of Edward's haughty disposition must have been, at this insolent address, he knew his in∣terest too well to engage in a quarrel with the pope, at a time when Guienne was sequestred in the hands of that pontiff. Indeed, when he first perused the contents, he swore, in a transport of anger, that if the pope persisted in such pretensions, he would destroy Scotland from sea to sea; and the Scottish de∣puties, who were present, could not hear such a menace without emotion. They told him he would find that work more difficult than he imagined; for there was not a Scot in the kingdom who would not spend the last drop of his blood in defence of his country. This declaration was not a little extraor∣dinary, considering the perfidy with which they had betrayed one another since the beginning of the war. The king's indignation gave way to his policy. He amused the archbishop with a general answer, implying, that as it was an affair which concerned the rights of the English crown, he could not make a
<PB N="617" REF="6260"/>
proper reply until he should have consulted his parliament; but, as a proof of his regard for his holiness, he ordered the bishop of Glasgow to be set at li∣berty; returned to England, where he disbanded his forces; and, at the re∣quest of the French king, consented to a truce with the Scots until Whitsun∣tide of the ensuing year. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<DIV4 N="56" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LVI.</HEAD>
<P>That Edward was extremely alarmed by this extravagant demand of Boniface, appears from the pains he took to invalidate his pretensions. He convoked a parliament at Lincoln in the beginning of the year, to consult with them upon this extraordinary affair, and deliberate upon a proper answer to his holiness. After some debates, it was resolved that a letter should be writ∣ten<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This letter, subscribed by one hundred barons, was followed by another from the king himself, accompanied with an abstract, like that which had been read in the assembly at Norham, to prove that the kingdom of Scotland had always been dependant upon the English crown. But with this difference; that whereas the first deduced the pretended right from Edward the ancient, this writing traced it back to Brutus, the first fabulous king of Albion; and brought it down through all the fictitious reigns recorded in the romance composed by Geffrey of Monmouth. Though these antique fables could have no effect upon the natives of Scotland, he hoped they might make a favourable im∣pression upon the pope and his Italians, who were not so well versed in the history of Britain. Edward's letter was couched in very respectful terms; so that his holiness could not take exceptions to one expression: an instance of moderation which could hardly have appeared upon such an occasion, had not the king of England been at the mercy of the pope, with regard to the restitution of Guienne. Nevertheless, he took care to protest that he did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claus. 25. Edw.

<P>This affair was not more interesting to the king, than another which now came upon the carpet, was of consequence to the people. The perambulations of the forests had been made in every county of England by the king's commissioners; all exceptions were discussed and answered, and the inquests and returns being read and approved in this parliament, the king con∣firmed them by his letters-patent, declaring that the lands disforested by those perambulations should continue so for ever, and the limits now fixed to all the forests, remain for ever unaltered and invariable. The laity were so well sa∣tisfied with this decision, which put a stop to infinite litigation and oppression, that they voted a subsidy of a fifteenth for the expence of the Scottish war; but archbishop Winchelsey, at the head of the clergy, refused to grant an aid with∣out the pope's licence. This prelate, like almost all his predecessors, was a despe∣rate bigot in every thing that related to the pope's usurped authority. He had excommunicated the king's officers, particularly the warden of the Cinque-Ports,

for exercising his right of judicature: he had denounced the same sen∣tence against seventeen monks of St. Augustine, and even imprisoned them because they insisted on their privileges: he arrogated to his own courts the cognizance of lay fees; and invaded on all occasions the rights of the crown, and secular jurisdiction: so that the king was continually employed in issuing writs to stop his proceedings. Upon his refusal to grant the present subsidy, Edward made application to the pope, in such a manner that he obtained a tenth, for three years, of all ecclesiastical revenues, on condition of its being<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</NOTE> divided between the king and his holiness. The business of the parliament being finished, the king created his son Edward prince of Wales and earl of Chester; and began to make preparations for prosecuting the war in Scotland: but as the manner of raising the aids was too slow for the emergencies of the ser∣vice, he extorted a loan from the trading towns, and compelled the people to pay their rents before they became due, that he might seize this subsidy by anticipation.</P>

This truce was signified to the governor, prelates, and nobility of Scotland, who joyfully assented to the stipulation, which was confirmed and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne.</NOTE> ratified by Baliol himself. Edward, however, had privately agreed with the king of France to give up the Scots at the expiration of this truce, in consi∣deration of his sacrificing his own ally the count of Flanders; and, in confi∣dence of this agreement, he carried on his preparations for completing the con∣quest of Scotland.

and even freed themselves, in a great measure from the Gallic yoke. They had cut in pieces four thousand French troops quartered at Bruges, defeated the count of Artois at Courtray, in a pitched battle, and recovered all the towns and fortresses of Flanders, except Dendermond. Philip had marched against them in person without success; and he saw no prospect of reducing them to obedience, while they should be supported by England, with which they carried on an advantageous commerce. He therefore expressed a desire of engaging in a league of friendship with Edward: plenipotentiaries were appointed on both sides; and in a little time peace was concluded at Paris, on condition that the territories seized by either party should be restored; and sa∣tisfaction be made for captures: that the hostages of Guienne, and the pri∣soners on both sides, should be released without ransom. A treaty of free commerce, and a league offensive and defensive, was established: the pope's award for a marriage between the prince of Wales and Isabel of France, was confirmed; and the count of Savoy, and the earl of Lincoln, as Edward's proxies, espoused the young princess with great solemnity. This last noble∣man took an oath of fealty to Edward, in the king's name, for Guienne; and it was agreed that Edward should do homage in person at Amiens, where the two kings proposed to have an interview in September. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>While these affairs were in agitation, Edward sent Seagrave with an army into Scotland rather to ruin the country than fight the natives, who he imagined were in no condition to make the least resistance. This general divided his forces into three bodies, that marched at the distance of some miles from one another; and, as he expected no opposition, he proceeded in the most careless security, till he reached Roslin, in the neighbourhood of Edin∣burgh. There he was attacked unexpectedly by the Scottish army, under the command of Cumin and Frazer, who routed his first division, and took him∣self prisoner. The next advanced to the relief of their general; and, as it equalled the Scots in number, charged them with great impetuosity, which, however, the enemy sustained; and, after an obstinate engagement, the Scots again proved victorious. When they had just finished the action, in which they suffered considerable damage, and a great part of their army was exhausted with fatigue and loss of blood, the third division of the English appeared, advancing at a round pace, to retrieve the honour which their countrymen had lost; and, as their number was considerably augmented by those who escaped from the two former engagements, they approached in full confidence of victory. The Scots, dismayed at their appearance, would have betaken themselves to flight, had not they been restrained by the remonstrances of their leaders, who exhorted them to make one effort more to augment the glory they had won, and preserve the spoils they had gathered. Thus animated, they supplied themselves with the arms of the vanquished, and mounting the horses they had taken, stood the shock of another battle, which they gained with great difficulty. The Scottish historians may be allowed to plume them∣selves<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> upon this triple victory, considering how often their countrymen, even by their own accounts, were defeated by the English during the reign of Edward.

The treasure was kept in Westminster∣abbey; and the monks were suspected of the robbery. It appeared from the inquisition that they were seen, on the very night in which it was carried off, passing to and from the neighbourhood of the treasury, with bundles and ham∣pers, which they conveyed by water.

<P>Edward, who entered Scotland about Whitsuntide, advanced to Edinburgh without having met with any considerable opposition. A party of the Scots still kept the field under Wallace, and the castle of Stirling had been taken by Cumin. Edward would not, however, stay to invest that fortress; because he wanted to penetrate into the northern shires, in order to cut off the communication between the different parts of the country, and prevent the enemy from joining their forces. He did not expect to meet with any re∣sistance in this progress; but he was mistaken. The castle of Brechin, com∣manded by Thomas Maule, refused to surrender; and he was obliged to un∣dertake a regular siege, and ply all his engines for twenty days without suc∣cess. The governor seemed to make light of his endeavours, and even pro∣voked him by exhibiting some marks of contempt, which, however, cost him his life; for, as he wiped the wall with his handkerchief, in derision of Ed∣ward's batteries, he was killed by a stone from one of these engines; and his death produced such a consternation in the garrison that they surrendered at discretion. The king would have found it impracticable to prosecute his march in this barren and desolate country, had not he been supplied from his fleet, which attended him upon the coast: but, thus provided, he continued his route to the castle of Urquhart, commanded by Alexander Wood, who stood an assault, and was put to the sword with his whole garrison. He found no further opposition in his progress to the nothern extremity of Scotland; from whence he returned to Dumfermling, and summoned William Oliphant to surrender the castle of Stirling, which he had before so gallantly defended. That officer refusing to submit, the king resolved to besiege the place in form, as soon as the weather would permit; and during the winter prepared his mi∣litary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1304.</NOTE> engines for reducing that important fortress. In the beginning of May he appeared before the castle, and carried on his operations with his usual im∣petuosity: but, notwithstanding all his efforts, the garrison, consisting of three hundred men, defended it to the latter end of July, when the ditches being filled up, a considerable breach effected, and the English army ready to give the assault, the governor, with about one hundred and forty of his people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Westmo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>After the reduction of this fortress, the Scots despairing of as∣sistance from the king of France, who had abandoned their interest, were fain to renew their submission to the conqueror; and Edward having found the bad effects of driving them to despair, thought proper to abate of his former severity. Cumin the guardian sent deputies to sue for peace and pardon; and after some conferences, it was agreed that he and his friends should be pardoned, upon their payment of a ransom or fine to be imposed in this next parliament, when the affairs of Scotland should be regulated; that all the
<PB N="621" REF="6300"/>
strong holds should remain in the hands of the king; and that the prisoners on both sides should be released. Several persons who had been active in the re∣volt against Edward, were excluded nominally from the benefit of this par∣don, except upon certain hard conditions; and it was expressly stipulated that Wallace should have no terms, but submit entirely to the mercy of the king. By this agreement, which was signed at Strathorde, the Scottish agents at Paris were allowed sufficient time to return and make their submission: John Cumin, and his adherents, did homage and swore fealty at Dumferling to Edward, who having subdued all opposition in Scotland, ordered the justices of his bench, with the courts of exchequer and chancery, to be removed from York to Westminster, while he himself set out for England; and making a progress through the northern counties, repaired to Lincoln, where he passed the Christ∣mas holidays. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the king's absence, England had been exposed to num∣berless<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1305.</NOTE> disorders, arising from the licence of the time, and a defect in the civil polity of the kingdom. In the western counties, bordering upon Wales, robberies, murders, and other outrages, were daily commited with impunity; for the perpetrators of those enormities were so numerous and formidable, as to set the officers of justice at defiance. In order to put a stop to such out∣rages, the king called a parliament at Westminster, where commissioners of inquest were issued to the justices to examine into those excesses; to try the authors by juries, in a summary way, and bring them immediately to condign punishment. In consequence of these powers, known by the name of writs of Trayle-baston, a great number of malefactors was put to death; many were punished with severe fines, and the rest fled the kingdom. By this time Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Ryley.</NOTE> had changed his plan of behaviour to the natives of Scotland. Instead of that contempt and severity with which he had treated them hitherto, he now adopted a more complaisant demeanour, which was the effect of true policy. He not only allowed them to ransom their lands, but resolved to attach their chief noblemen and prelates to his interest, by offices of kindness. Robert de Brus, earl of Carrick, and son to the competitor, dying at this period, his son of the same name had livery of his lands upon doing homage to the king of England, who bestowed particular marks of favour upon him, and two of his countrymen, namely, John Mowbray and the bishop of Glasgow; though all three had violently opposed him in the last insurrection. He now desired them to consider of a proper time and place for convening a par∣liament, that should regulate the civil government of Scotland; and, in pur∣suance of their advice, ten deputies were appointed to come and treat with the English commissioners, at a parliament summoned to meet in September for that purpose. There it was agreed that eight justices should be constituted to regulate the affairs of the nation. John de Bretagne, the king's nephew, was created guardian of the realm; and William de Bevercotes, and John de Sandale, both clergymen, were continued in the posts of chancellor and cham∣berlain of the kingdom. It was resolved that the laws and usages of the Scots should be abolished; and that a parliament should be assembled in Scotland, under the eye of the guardian, to consider the laws of king David, and the amendments which had been made in them by his successors: that without consulting the king they should alter and reform all such laws and customs as
<PB N="622" REF="6310"/>
shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d appear inconsistent with religion and reason; and that those articles in which his interposition might be necessary, should be ingrossed in writing, and sent by deputies from the states of Scotland to the parliament of England, where they should be examined and discussed, with the concurrence of those deputies empowered for that purpose by their constituents. At the close of the session, Edward published an act of indemnity in favour of the Scots who had submitted: yet this was clogged with certain restrictions, that bore hard upon some individuals; and Bruce was obliged to surrender the strong castle of Kil∣drummy. The king was jealous of this earl's talents and influence; and for that reason took care that he should not be included in the list of commission∣ers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> All the Scottish prelates and nobility then at London, together with the deputies, took an oath to observe these regulations; but the earl of Carrick had been sent to Scotland in order to assist at the convention which no∣minated the deputies of that kingdom. There his ambition was stimulated, by resentment of the wrong he had sustained in the loss of his castle; and he began to form that plan which he afterwards executed with incredible fortitude and perseverance.</P>

<P>In all probability he would have associated Wallace in his coun∣cils, had not that truly great man been delivered into the hands of the Eng∣lish by Sir John Monteith, Edward's Scottish favourite, and governor of the castle of Dunbarton. The Scottish writers alledge that he was betrayed in the most perfidious manner, and apprehended as he lay asleep in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. But although he was surprized by a party under the command of Monteith, he cannot be justly said to have been betrayed, as that officer was a professed adherent of king Edward. This renowned prisoner was im∣mediately conveyed to London, in the midst of infinite crouds of people, assembled to see the man whose name had filled the whole country with terror. On the very next day he was brought to his trial at Westminster-hall, where he was placed upon a high chair, and crowned with laurel in derision. Being accused of treason, he pleaded not guilty, and refused to own the jurisdiction of the court; affirming it was equally unjust and absurd to charge him with treason against a prince whose sovereignty he had never acknowledged; and that as he was a free-born native of an independent nation, he could not be deemed subject to the laws of England. The judges over-ruled his plea; and, upon the maxim of Edward's being the immediate sovereign of Scotland, found him guilty of high treason. He was condemned to die the death of a traitor; and the sentence being executed with all the circumstances of barba∣rity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey.</NOTE> his head and quarters were exposed in the chief cities of England. This was a mean triumph in Edward, over a man of whose reputation he was en∣vious. The English historians represent Wallace as a ruffian, who had com∣mitted the most shocking cruelties upon women and infants, in the course of his expeditions. The Scots extol him as an unblemished hero. Had he been really guilty of such barbarities, it would have been much more for the repu∣tation of Edward to try him on account of those crimes, than to convict him upon an impeachment which has left an indelible stain upon his own memory. Edward was a prince of great courage and abilities; but there was nothing liberal in his disposition. He had seen repeated proofs of this man's invin∣cible prowess and patriotism; he had made repeated efforts to corrupt his in∣tegrity;
<PB N="623" REF="6320"/>
he must have admired his character when he sacrificed him to his jealousy and revenge. Edward condemned him as a traitor; Henry II. would have revered him as an hero.</P>

<HEAD>§ LXV.</HEAD>
<P>Robert de Brus, father to the present earl of Carrick, had al∣ways considered Wallace as an ambitious upstart, who aspired to the crown of Scotland; and in this opinion persecuted him with unceasing hatred, until they had an occasional conference immediately after the battle of Falkirk. Bruce was then in the service of Edward, and at the head of a strong detach∣ment endeavoured to cut off the retreat of the Scottish regent: but finding himself baffled by the conduct of Wallace, who by this time had passed the river Carron, he called aloud to him, and upbraided him with his supposed attempt upon the sovereignty of his country. The regent, from the other bank, made such a reply as the integrity of his own heart suggested, and in his turn reproached Bruce with his servile adherence to the implacable enemy of Scotland, who had already destroyed the independency of that crown, which it was the duty of Bruce in a peculiar manner to defend. His words made a deep impression on the mind of Robert, who was never afterwards hearty in Edward's interest; and he communicated such a favourable idea of Wallace to his son, that this noblemen would undoubtedly have had recourse to his advice and assistance, had not his design been anticipated by the un∣worthy fate of that unshaken patriot. Thus disappointed, he cast his eyes on Cumin, who had succeeded Wallace in the regency. He was a young nobleman of great power and interest, and Baliol, to whom he was related, having abdicated the throne, he succeeded as competitor with Bruce for the so∣vereignty. The earl of Carrick, conscious of his own aspiring genius, which predominated over the fortune of his rival, found means to sound the inclina∣tions of Cumin, and to establish such an understanding between them, that a treaty was concluded and ratified by oath, and an indenture drawn, by which Cumin engaged to support Bruce with all his interest, in his attempts to ascend the throne. In consideration of which assistance, Bruce obliged him∣self to acknowledge Cumin as first prince of the blood, and bestow upon him all the private patrimony which he possessed as earl of Carrick. Cumin, either terrified at the dangerous confederacy in which he had engaged, or with a view to destroy his rival, and conciliate the favour of Edward at the same time, sent a transcript of his agreement with Bruce to the king of England, who re∣ceived it just as the earl of Carrick arrived in London, to concert measures with some of the Scottish nobility who had come up to settle the affairs of their nation in the last parliament. Edward sent for him to court, and pro∣duced the indenture, which Bruce affirmed to be a forgery; and the king, who was a little staggered in his opinion, did not think proper to commit him to close custody; though he ordered him to be surrounded with spies, in such a manner that all his words and actions reached the knowledge of the king, who at last resolved to secure his person. Before he executed this resolution, Robert's brother-in-law, the earl of Gloucester, being apprized of the king's intention, sent a few pieces of money, and a pair of spurs, to the earl of Car∣rick, on pretence of restoring what he had borrowed. Bruce conceiving the meaning of these emblems, took horse immediately, and in seven days arrived in his own castle at Lochmaban, where he found some of his particular friends, to whom he communicated the treachery of Cumin. Hearing that
<PB N="624" REF="6330"/>
nobleman was then at Dumfries, he went thither to expoftulate with him upon his perfidy; and meeting him in the cloisters of a monastery belonging to the Grey-friars, reproached him in severe terms for his persidious conduct. Cumin retorted his obloquy, and a virulent altercation ensuing, Bruce, in a transport of passion, plunged his poignard in the other's breast. After having com∣mitted this assassination, he retired and mounted his horse, when his atten∣dants perceiving marks of confusion in his countenance, desired to know what<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1306.</NOTE> had passed in the interview with Cumin. He then recounted the particulars of the conversation; and Sir Christopher Seton, who, though an Englishman, was one of his most zealous partisans, hearing the circumstance of Cumin's being wounded, "What! (said he) "have you left the work half done." So saying he repaired to the cloisters, with some followers, and understanding the monks had removed Cumin into the church, that he might confess his sins and receive absolution, he advanced to the altar, which he stained with the blood of that unhappy nobleman, and a knight of the same name who<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. West. Hemingford.</NOTE> came to his assistance. The behaviour of Bruce was savage; but that of Seton was altogether impious and inhuman. Bruce seeing all competition removed by the death of Cumin, began to take measures for ascending the Scottish throne, which had been vacant since the deposition of John Baliol; and to which Ro∣bert thought he acquired a new claim by the death of that unhappy prince, which happened in France about this period. He had long ago lost the af∣fection and esteem of his subjects; and his son Edward, who remained a pri∣soner in England, was unheeded and unknown on the north side of the Tweed; so that his interest could not interfere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the projects of greatness formed by the earl of Carrick.</P>

<P>While this aspiring young nobleman employed his extraordinary talents and extensive influence, in securing the suffrages of his countrymen for raising him to the sovereignty of Scotland, Edward's attention was engrossed by some unpopular measures, which might have been productive of very mis∣chievous consequences. He was so jealous of his authority, that he never forgave any person who presumed to dispute his prerogative, or disobey his regulations. Nicholas Seagrave, one of the most accomplished knights of the age, being accused of some misdemeanour, appealed to the trial by single combat, which the king refusing, he challenged his accuser to meet him in another kingdom; and went abroad for that purpose. At his return he was apprehended by the king's order, and tried before the judges, who found him guilty of treason, and condemned him to death; though the sentence was qua∣lified with a clause empowering the king to indulge him with a pardon. Ed∣ward was incensed at their presumption, in attempting to limit his preroga∣tive, and reviled them in the most indecent terms: Seagrave, however, was pardoned and set at liberty, by the intercession of some noblemen, who under∣took to be responsible for his future behaviour. The king was so punctual with respect to the observance of the laws, that he punished delinquents, with∣out respect of persons. His own son prince Edward, being influenced by his favourite Piers Gaveston<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to insult the bishop of Chester, his father gave or∣ders to commit him to the public prison, that he might learn to respect justice before he should become her vicegerent: or rather that he might be deterred from revolting against the authority of his sovereign. All Edward's views were directed to the increase and establishment of his own grandeur; and
<PB N="623" REF="6340"/>
all the salutary laws which he enacted, were either extorted by the clamours of his people, whom he would not venture to exasperate, or calculated for the purposes of his ambition. Boniface dying at this period, was succeeded by Clement V. a native of Bourdeaux, and creature of Edward, who sollicited a dispensation of the oath he had taken to observe the two charters; and the new pope made no difficulty of absolving him from a promise which the king re∣presented as the effects of compulsion. The English people were not a little<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Public.</NOTE> alarmed at this dispensation, which seemed the prelude of arbitrary power; and Edward's subsequent conduct justified their apprehension. Finding the nation unwilling to grant such subsidies as he demanded to maintain the war, he had recourse to the assistance of the pope, who granted a tenth upon the clergy for three years, on condition that he himself should retain one half for his own occasions. This scandalous traffic gave such offence to the kingdom, that the parliament remonstrated against it, and even forbade the collectors to levy the imposition: but the king was resolved to be obeyed, and the col∣lectors were commanded to proceed, on pain of his displeasure. These funds being insufficient to defray the expence of the war, he resolved to levy a scutage on pretence of his son's knighthood; and to render this tax the less unpalatable, he invited all the young gentlemen, who were ambitious of that honour, to come and be knighted with prince Edward at Westminster, where they should receive the robes suited to that dignity. At the same time he summoned a parliament, from which he demanded a supply; and received a thirtieth of temporalities belonging to the clergy and lay-noblemen, knights, and com∣monalty, except the boroughs and towns of the king's demesnes, which were obliged to pay a twentieth of all their moveables. Such a number of young noblemen, and others, assembled in consequence of Edward's invitation, that the royal palace not sufficing for their accommodation, they were entertained in tents and pavilions pitched in the garden of the New Temple. They after∣wards kept their vigils in Westminster-abbey with prince Edward, who was next day knighted by his father in the palace; and from thence repairing to the church of Westminster, conferred the same dignity at the high altar upon two hundred and fifty young noblemen, who being thus dubbed his companions, engaged to attend him in the expedition to Scotland, which the king could no longer defer with any regard to his own honour and advan∣tage. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

<P>Bruce, immediately after the murder of Cumin, surprized the castle of Dumfries, and apprehended the English judges, who sat in the great hall to hear and determine causes. Then traversing the country with a body of his vassals, he reduced a number of fortress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and expelled the English from the kingdom. In a little time he was joined by a majority of the Scottish nation, who were glad of an opportunity to snake off the yoke of Edward, whom they detested; and at length he was crowned at Scone, by the hands of the countess of Buchan, sister to the earl of Fife, who was attached to the service of Edward. This was a privilege inherent in that family; and the countess claimed the honour of the function, which she performed in the pre∣sence of the bishops of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Murray, and a good number of noblemen. Edward, apprized of these transactions, vowed revenge against the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heming<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd.</NOTE> whole Scottish nation, which he resolved to enslave. He summoned his pre∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,

nobility, and all who held by knights service, to meet him at Carlile, which was appointed as the general rendezvous; and constituted the archbishop of York, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he bishop of Litchfield, guardians of England during his ab∣sence. Mean while he detached a body of forces into Scotland, under the command of Aymer de Valence, Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, who advanced as far as Perth, where Robert de Brus challenged them to battle, which they thought proper to decline. After this bravado he encamped at M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thuen, and his soldiers despising an enemy who durst not meet them in the field<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> began to enjoy their repose and refreshment in the most blind security, when the English attacked them in the evening so suddenly, that their leader had not time to draw them up in order of battle. Nevertheless, he made a gallant resistance, and was three times dismounted, and as often relieved by the bravery of Simon de Fraser. But at length his army being routed, he escaped with a few followers to Dalree, on the frontiers of Argyle: a good number of his troops fled to the mountains; but a great number of persons of distinction were taken and executed on the spot as traitors.</P>

<P>Immediately after this victory Edward entered Scotland, and divided his army into two separate bodies. One of these marched northward under the command of prince Edward, assisted by the earls of Lancaster and Hereford, and surprized the castle of Kildrummy, in which they found the wife and sister of Robert de Brus, with his brother Niel, and several persons of quality. His other two brothers, Thomas and Alexander, were afterterwards taken in the castle of Lochryan in Cantyre, from which Robert himself escaped with difficulty; and Edward met with no further resistance in his progress through Scotland. His anger was disappointed in the submission of the na∣tives. He was ashamed to extirpate those who made no opposition; and the blood of his prisoners was not sufficient to assuage the thirst and fury of his indignation. The guardian and justices were directed to proclaim in all cities, boroughs, or market towns, that all who were concerned in the last rebellion against the king, should be pursued with hue and cry, until apprehended dead or alive; and that those who neglected to prosecute them in this manner, should forfeit their effects, and be imprisoned during his majesty's pleasure; that those concerned in the death of John Cumin should be put to death with∣out mercy, as well as those by whom they were harboured and entertained; that those who acted against the king's peace should be imprisoned during the king's pleasure; and that such as were pressed into the rebellion, should be fined according to the judgment of the guardian. After having published these injunctions, under the seal of Scotland, Edward gave a loose to vengeance, and under the shadow of justice sacrificed his captives to revenge. The sister of Bruce, and countess of Buchan, were shut up in wooden cages, and hung over the battlements of different castles: the execution of private persons be∣came so common that it was no longer regarded. The bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow were loaded with chains, and committed to dungeons. The wife of Bruce was sent captive into England, of which she was a native; the earl of Athole was hanged at London: this was likewise the fate of Simon de Fraser; Herbert Norham and Thomas Boyd were beheaded; Christopher de Seton was drawn, hanged, and quartered; and the two brothers of Bruce fell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> by the hands of the common executioner. Edward first compelled those un∣happy
<PB N="625" REF="6360"/>
happy people to take the oath of allegiance; then provoked them by op∣pression to renounce that engagement; and lastly punished them as traitors. He ought to have considered that pope Boniface had as good a right to release Bruce and his followers from the oath they had taken to Edward king of Eng∣land, as pope Clement had to absolve Edward from the oath he had taken to his own subjects.</P>

<P>Edward having reduced Scotland to such an abject state of help∣less misery, as he thought would disable the inhabitants from any future re∣volt; and taking it for granted that Robert de Bruce had perished by famine or the sword, returned to Carlile, where he summoned a parliament, to re∣dress the grievances of monasteries and religious houses, which were burthened with talliages, tributes, and other impositions, by the agents of the pope, on pretence of visitations contrary to the laws and customs of the kingdom. These exactions were condemned as injurious to the crown, and prejudicial to the country; and a letter was written to the pope, in the name of the clergy and laity, complaining of the practice of his ministers, and desiring his holiness to prevent such abuse for the future. Testa, the pope's chief agent, was sum∣moned before the parliament, and forbid to levy any more money in his master's name. He was even ordered to keep what he had already collected, until the king should dispose of it by the advice of his council; and writs were issued to seize and imprison all such persons as he had employed in those and other extortions. These proceedings, however, were stopped at the interces∣sion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1307.</NOTE> of the new legate Peter D'Espagne, whom his holiness had sent over to finish the marriage of the prince of Wales, which was retarded by a dispute about the castle of Mauleon in Gascony. This important fortress had been given by Philip to a certain knight, who now refused to cede it without an equivalent; and Edward would not allow his son to consummate the nuptials, until this castle and its territory should be restored. The prince of Wales was not displeased at this delay of a match that could not but interfere with the gratification of his passions. He had already exhibited signs of an idle, vicious, and disolute disposition; and his excesses seemed to multiply as his years in∣creased. He had been banished from court for insulting the bishop of Litch∣field, and severely reprimanded by his father for his profligacy and extrava∣gance, so opposite to his own parsimony and love of order: but his irre∣gularities becoming every day more and more intolerable, and Piers Gaveston being supposed to be the author of the evil counsel by which he was influ∣enced, the king banished this favourite from the realm; and one hundred marks a year, to be payed out of the revenue of Guienne, were allowed for his subsistence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.</NOTE></P>

<P>During this session of parliament, Edward being informed of fresh commotions excited in the highlands by Robert de Brus, who was still alive and indefatigable, prevailed upon the pope's legate to denounce the sentence of excommunication against him and all his abettors, and resolved to march in person in the spring to ferret him out of his lurking-places. After the battle of Methuen, Bruce had retired with the wreck of his forces to the borders of Argyle, where he was again routed by the lord Lorn, a trusty adherent of Ed∣ward; and obliged to lurk in woods and caverns, attended by the earl of Len∣nox and Gilbert Hay, who would not abandon him in his distress. In this
<PB N="626" REF="6370"/>
condition, he had no sustenance but that which he enjoyed in common with the beasts of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld, and the fowls of heaven; and he was hunted by his own countrymen f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m rock to rock, like an enemy to mankind. From this per∣secution he withdrew to a little island called Raughrine, where he lay concealed until the report of his death prevailed over all the neighbouring country; and though he was exposed to all the miseries of want, and all the inclemencies of weather, he never betrayed the least symptom of dejection, nor resigned the hope of being one day able to re-ascend the throne of Scotland, and vindicate the independence of his crown. When he heard that Edward had returned to Carlile, he found means to make his friends acquainted with his being alive; a small body of half armed troops being assembled by Sir James Douglas, and Sir Robert Boyd, he came forth from his retreat, and putting himself at their head, attacked and cut off an English detachment which guarded a con∣voy of provisions. This was a very valuable acquisition, in a double respect; for he not only acquired store of provisions, at a time when he wanted sub∣sistence, but was enabled to arm his followers; with whom, though they did not exceed four hundred, he took the castle of Turnberry, and obliged the lord Henry Percy, who commanded in those parts, to retreat towards the bor∣ders of England. Edward was no sooner apprized of these exploits, which were performed in the severest season of the year, than he ordered the earl of Pembroke, and the lord Lorn, who had defeated him in the preceding year, to take the field and crush him in the infancy of his good fortune; and this order they executed with such industry and expedition, that Bruce found him∣self in danger of being surrounded on a mountain, where he must either have perished by famine or surrendered to his enemies, if he had not been able to accomplish an escape. Perceiving the highlanders under lord Lorn taking a compass round the hill, in order to cut off his retreat, he harrangued his small body of troops, that did not yet amount to a thousand, and representing the inevitable destruction to which they must have been exposed by remaining in their entrenchments, he exhorted them to disperse into small parties, by which means they would vanish imperceptibly from their enemies; and he de∣sired they would meet him at a certain time in the wood of Glentroule, near Cumnock. Having received these directions, they seemed to melt away in∣sensibly, and escaped by the help of the rocks and shrubs that sheltered them from the view of their adversaries, who were not a little confounded at their disappointment, when they took possession of the hill, and found the entrench∣ments of Bruce entirely abandoned. The fugitive prince having re-assembled his friends at the place appointed, was joined by small reinforcements, which enabled him to maintain the footing he had gained. The earl of Pembroke following him from one retreat to another, he at last decoyed that nobleman into a disadvantageous situation, and fell upon him with such fury that the English troops were defeated. He afterwards attacked a detachment com∣manded by the earl of Gloucester, who, after an obstinate dispute, was obliged to take refuge in the castle of Aire, which Robert immediately in∣vested. These atchievements revived the drooping spirits of the Scots, who now flocked to his banner; so that in a little time his army was encreased to ten thousand men, though they were generally unarmed, and utterly ignorant of discipline.</P>

<P>Mean while Edward remained at Carlisle, impatiently waiting for the troops he had summoned, in order to extirpate the Scottish name; and the first that assembled were sent immediately to relieve the earl of Gloucester. Bruce seeing the English advance, thought proper to raise the siege: but he could not retreat with such expedition but that he was attacked and routed; and obliged to fly for shelter to inaccessible fastnesses, where he remained till the death of Edward. The period of this great prince's life now ap∣proached. He was seized with a dysentery at Carlile; and though the distem∣per was deemed extremely dangerous, he was inflamed with such a desire of wreaking his vengeance upon the enemy, that he began his march for Scot∣land, and proceeded as far as a place called Burgh on the Sands, where, finding nature almost exhausted, he gave directions that even after his death he should be carried into Scotland, as a sure presage of victory over a people whom he had always defeated. Then he regulated his spiritual concerns, and expired in the arms of his servants, while they raised him up that he might take some nourishment. Thus died Edward I. king of England, on the seventh day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Mat. West.</NOTE> July, after having reigned four and thirty years with great reputation and success. He was a prince of a very dignified appearance; tall in stature, re∣gular and comely in his features, with keen piercing black eyes; and of an aspect that commanded reverence and esteem. His constitution was robust; his strength and dexterity perhaps unequalled in his kingdom; and his shape was unblemished in all other respects but that of his legs, which are said to have been too long in proportion to his body; whence he derived the epithet of Long Shanks. In the qualities of the head he equalled the greatest monarchs who have sat on the English throne: he was cool, penetrating, sagacious, and cir∣cumspect. The remotest corners of the earth resounded with the fame of his courage; and all over Europe he was considered as the flower of chivalry. Nor was he less consummate in his legislative capacity than eminent for his military prowess. He may be stiled the English Justinian: for, besides the excellent statutes that were enacted in his reign, he new-modelled the admini∣stration of justice, so as to render it more sure and summary; he fixed proper bounds to the different courts of jurisdiction; settled a new and easy method of collecting the revenue, and established wise and effectual regulations for pre∣serving peace and order among his subjects. Yet, with all these good quali∣ties, he cherished a dangerous ambition, to which he did not scruple to sacri∣fice the good of his country: witness his ruinous war with Scotland, which drained the kingdom of men and money, and gave rise to that rancorous enmity which in the sequel proved so prejudicial to both nations. That he was arbitrary in his disposition appears in many instances of his reign, particularly that of seizing for his own use the merchandize of his subjects; a stretch of prerogative more suitable to the conduct of an eastern emperor, than to that of an English monarch. The cruelty of his nature was manifested in every expedition he undertook, either in Wales or Scotland. His integrity may be questioned from the nature of his transactions with the competitors of the Scottish crown; and the renunciation of the oath he had taken to his sub∣jects. Though he is celebrated for his chastity and regular deportment, there is not, in the whole course of his reign, one instance of liberality or munificence.

<P>THE glory of England seemed to set with Edward I. His son and succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssor, Edward of Caernarvon, neither inherited his talents, nor took the least pains to execute his designs, and follow his advice. Instead of prosecuting the war against Scotland, according to the injunctions he had re∣ceived from his father, he took no effectual step to check the progress of Bruce; and his march into that country was rather a procession of pageantry than an expedition. After having been proclaimed at Carlile, and received the oath of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llegiance from the prelates and nobility of England, he repaired to Rox∣burgh and Dumfries, to receive the homage of the Scots; and seemed to be hig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly delighted with the ceremonies which attended the solemnity. Then advancing at the head of his army as far as Chimmock, he empowered Aymer earl of Pembroke to treat with the Scots concerning a pacification, and ap∣pointed him guardian of that kingdom; though that office was afterwards be∣stowed upon John de Bretagne, and the post of chamberlain was conferred<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> upon Eustace de Cotisbache. Edward having made this ridiculous parade, re∣turned to England, where, in direct opposition to the promise he had solemnly made to his father, he recalled his favourite Piers Gaveston, to whom he made a grant of the whole estate belonging to the late <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Cornwal. Not content with having exhibited this extravagant mark <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his favour and affection, he presented him with the sum of two and thirty thousand pounds, which the late king had reserved for the maintenance of one hundred and forty knights, who had undertaken to carry his heart to Jerusalem; and indeed his attachment to this foreigner seemed to glow with all the ardor of a passionate admirer. Had Edward been a woman, such raptures would have been natural; for Gaveston possessed every personal accomplishment. Actuated by the counsels of this minion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he removed from their offices the chancellor, treasurer, judges, and baron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the exchequer, and filled their places with his creatures.

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The nation hoped that this marriage would have weaned the king from his affection to Gaveston, or at least divided his attention; but his love for that minion seemed daily to encrease. He bestowed upon him all the sumptuous presents he had received from his father-in-law; affected to call him brother; caressed him as if he had been a mistress; and published a pro∣clamation enjoining all persons to call him earl of Cornwal. Piers could not bear this favour with moderation: intoxicated with power, he became proud and insolent, and affected to treat the English nobility with scorn an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> derision: the queen herself was not exempted from his ridicule and slights. He was so enamoured of his own qualities, that he payed no regard to those of other people. He held tournaments, in which he was always victorious. He af∣fected not only to outshine the nobles of the land, but even to eclipse his sove∣reign; and appeared with such fastidious pomp at the coronation, carrying the imperial crown, that one of the earls could hardly be prevented from sacrificing him to his resentment. The nobility had signified to the king that they would not attend at the ceremony until Gaveston should be banished the kingdom; but he prevailed upon them to alter that resolution, with a promise to grant their request in the next parliament. In the interval, between the coronation and that assembly, Edward in vain tampered with individuals, in hope of making a strong party in favour of his darling; and miscarrying in all his at∣tempts, began to fortify his towns and castles, as if he meant to set his sub∣jects at defiance. The nobility followed his example; and every thing seemed to presage a civil war. At the parliament they appeared in arms, and renewed their instances for the banishment of Gaveston. Some persons of moderation dreading the prospect of national calamities, interposed their good offices to mediate an accommodation: but the barons still insisted upon the expulsion of Gaveston, though they consented to his enjoying his whole estate. They de∣manded that he should abjure the realm before Midsummer; and the bishops denounced him excommunicated should he continue longer in the island. Ed∣ward was obliged, though with unspeakable reluctance, to give up the possession of his confident; but, in order to console him for his misfortune, he granted the honours of the High Pec, and Cockermouth, with several man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs and
<PB N="634" REF="6430"/>
castles, to him and his countess, and their heirs for ever. He likewise indulged him with the grant of a large estate in Gascony; and that his exile might sit as easy as possible upon him, he appointed him lord lieutenant of Ireland; assigned the whole revenue of that kingdom for his subsistence, and convoyed him in person to Bristol. As he foresaw that these steps would give umbrage to the barons, he employed all his industry in gaining over a majority to his interest, by caresses and acts of favour; and ordered, by proclamation, that none should appear armed at the ensuing parliament. The earls of Lincoln and Surrey being mollified by the king's concessions and intreaties, desisted from the persecution of Gaveston; and the whole association, except Guy earl of Warwick, laid aside their resentment.</P>

The king sollicited Clement to release him from this restriction; but his im∣patience being too keen to brook the delay of the pope's answer, he recalled Gaveston, and went as far as Chester to receive him in his return from Ireland. Then he expressed such transports at their meeting, that the people did not scruple to say he was bewitched; and conveyed him to Langley in Hertford∣shire, where he enjoyed him for some time, without being interrupted by his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

The barons being disunited in their councils, were obliged to stifle their indignation at this shameful passion of Edward, who, at the next parliament assembled at Stamford, prevailed upon the nobility to consent that his paramour should remain in England without molestation. He was so well pleased with this instance of their condescension, that he squandered away great sums of money upon balls, tournaments, and other public diversions, in which Gaveston might have an opportunity to display his accomplishments: but none of the barons appeared at these rejoicings; and the lists being inclosed at Ke∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngton for a tournament, the pillars were taken away, and the inclosure broken down in the night, by persons unknown. Gaveston, whom no lesson of ad∣versity could improve, resumed all his insolence and prodigality; and with a view to secure a strong party in his favour, divested a great number of people of their places, and bestowed them upon his own adherents. By which means he entailed upon himself the implacable hatred of all those whom he had de∣prived of their employments, without adding to the strength of his own inte∣rest. This conduct revived the animosity of the whole nation: the nobles were shocked at his presumption; and the earl of Lancaster vowed revenge against him for some private injury he had sustained at his hands. He seemed to laugh at their dissatisfaction; expressed the utmost contempt for the resent∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. Mon.

<P>The earls were more incensed at these personal indignities, than at any circumstance of his public administration. They renewed their consultations, and endeavoured to re-unite their party for his destruction. With this view they appointed several tournaments successively, that their partisans might have an opportunity to assemble; but all these meetings were prohibited by procla∣mation. The king convoked a parliament at York; but no business was transacted, because the earls did not assist at the session. Another was sum∣moned
<PB N="635" REF="6440"/>
to meet at the same place; and as they still declined appearing, on pre∣tence of dreading Gaveston's treachery, he desired his favourite to withdraw, and adjourned the parliament to Westminster. Being apprehensive of some violence, he issued particular writs to the earls of Lancaster, Hereford, Pem∣broke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1310.</NOTE> and Warwick, forbidding them to come armed to parliament; and the earls of Gloucester, Lincoln, Surrey, and Richmond, undertook for their safe-conduct. Nevertheless, the discontented noblemen and barons appeared with numerous retinues, and resolved to compel the king to redress the grie∣vances of the nation. Edward, in order to supply the necessities of his house∣hold, had taken prise and purveyance, or in other words, plundered the sub∣jects of their merchandise, contrary to the express law which had been enacted in his father's reign; and this exertion of arbitrary power furnished the barons with a popular subject of complaint. They represented the damages sustained by the merchants whose effects had been seized: they expatiated upon the miseries of the kingdom, impoverished by the prodigality of the king, and harassed by such oppresive measures: they drew a comparison between the flourishing state of the kingdom in his father's time, and the con∣temptible condition to which it was then reduced: they imputed this disho∣nourable change to want of oeconomy and evil counsels; and insisted upon the king's empowering them to elect twelve persons authorized to make ordinances for regulating his houshold, and settling the affairs of the nation. At first he scrupled to comply with this demand; but, as they were determined to carry their point, and threatened to proceed to extremities, he thought proper to submit, and issued a commission empowering the prelates, earls, and barons, to chuse proper persons for making those ordinances. Yet the power of electing the ordainers was not vested in the whole parliament, but in eleven bishops, eight earls, and thirteen barons, who declared, in an authentic instrument, that this grant proceeded entirely from the king's own free will, and should not be drawn into a precedent to the prejudice of his majesty, his heirs, and successors; and that their commissions should expire at Michaelmas in the following year. This instrument being signed and ratified, the ordainers were chosen, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley.

<P>Edward having thus reconciled himself to his subjects, resolved to prosecute the war with Scotland, in which his interest was by this time almost totally decayed. Robert de Brus, who was perhaps the greatest prince of his time, and justly stiled the restorer of the Scottish monarchy, had been pre∣vented from taking immediate advantage of the late king's death by a violent distemper, which reduced him to extremity: and had young Edward improved this opportunity, he might have with great ease executed the design which his father had projected; but his sudden return freed the Scots in a great measure from that terror and perplexity under which they laboured. At his departure from Scotland, he left his forces under the command of John Cumin, the most powerful of all the Scottish nobility, whom he knew to be the inveterate enemy of Bruce and his adherents. He was joined by a strong reinforcement of his

It was immediately after this transaction that he was taken ill; and the news of his distemper reaching Cumin, this nobleman resolved to draw the Brussian forces into an engag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment, where they could not avail themselves of the con∣duct, nor be animated by the presence of their leader. He accordingly marched to Inverury<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where they were encamped; and Robert being informed of his design, ordered his a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>end<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to carry him into the field, where his army was drawn up under his eye, and by his immediate direction. Then he was set upon horseback, supported by two domestics, and conveyed to the front of the line, where he continued to direct the battle. His people fought with such alacrity in presence of their beloved prince, that Cumin and Mowbray were soon defeated; and the satisfaction produced from this success in all probability contributed to the recovery of the victor. He now surprized the castle of In∣verness, over-ran Murray, from whence he drove the earl of Buchan before him; then entering Angus, reduced the castles of Brechin and Forfar, and sub∣dued the whole country to the northward of these fortresses. Donald of the isles, and John lord of Argyle, being the most powerful enemies he had now to encount<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in his own country, he detached his brother Edward with a body of troops to reduce the first, and he himself marched against the other. The same success attended both expeditions. Donald was routed and taken, and John was defeated and obliged to retire into England. By these victories Brus became master of the western coasts, and was enabled to equip a fleet of ships for the protection of the isles which he had conquered. Having reduced all Scotland to his obedience, he made incursions into Northumberland, where he ravaged the country without opposition; Edward being so distressed by the diss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tisfaction of the nobility, and emptine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his exchequer, that he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defend his dominions from this invader.</P>

<P>While he was thus restricted and hampered by his own subjects, as well as by the enemy, he listened to the suggestions of his father-in-law the French king, who proposed a truce with the Scots, which was accordingly concluded by the negotiation of the earl of Gloucester and two papal nuncio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. This was a very convenient cessation for Robert de Brus, who now found lei∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re to establish a regular form of government, and conciliate the affection of the nobility, who had been hitherto averse to his interest. After such repeated proofs of his valour and sagacity, the majority of those who had formerly op∣posed him were now inclined to acknowlege the deliverer of their country; and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> his title was recognized in a full convention of the estates. What considerably tended to the confirmation of his authority, was an ambassador sent to him in the person of Oliver des Roches, who passed through England by virtue of a safe-conduct granted by Edward. He hoped that a speedy peace would be the result of the negociation: but the success of his endeavours was prevent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots, who renewed their incursions on the English bor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r without any regard to the truce; and Edward summoned his military te∣na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="637" REF="6460"/>
to meet him at Newcastle upon Tyne by Michaelmas, that he might chastise the Scots for having violated the convention. The discontented barons refusing to attend at the rendezvous, the expedition was laid aside, and the truce renewed: but the Scots recommencing hostilities, the king sent for Richard de Burgh earl of Ulster, and a body of forces from Ireland; ordered a fleet to sail towards the mouth of the Tay, for the security of Perth, which was still in his possession, and appointed another rendezvous at Berwick. Tho' the earls of Lancaster, Pembroke, Warwick, and Hereford, excused them∣selves from going thither, on account of the ordinances about which the com∣mittee was employed at London, Edward resolved to proceed with his enter∣prize; and entering Scotland, advanced as far as Linlithgow, without seeing the face of an enemy. The soldiers of Robert de Brus were not yet sufficiently trained for a pitched battle; and therefore he retired before the English army, after having removed every thing that could serve them for forage or sub∣sistence. He did not fail, however, to pour down from the mountains oc∣casionally, upon detached parties of the enemy, which he generally interrupted and destroyed: so that Edward seeing his forces insensibly diminish, and begin∣ning to be in great want of provision, retreated to Berwick, where he passed the winter.</P>

<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>He now gave directions for fortifying all his castles in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> and supplying them with plenty of stores and ammunition: and in the spring he sent his favourite Gaveston with the bulk of his army against Brus, who had recovered in the winter all the places which Edward reduced in the pre∣ceding campaign. Piers penetrated beyond the frith of Forth; but, as he could not draw the Scots to a general engagement, he did not perform any considerable service. When he returned to Berwick, the king set out for Lon∣don, where he had summoned a parliament to meet on the eighth day of Au∣gust, that they might confirm the new ordinances. These were accordingly delivered to his council, and found so injurious to the royal dignity, that Ed∣ward at first rejected several articles as contrary to the nature of the commission, by which they were restricted from doing any thing to his prejudice. The committee were as tenacious of every particular; and the king, in order to prevent mischief, at length gave his assent, after having protested, that if any article contained in those ordinances should be found prejudicial to the king, or unauthorize<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by his commission, it should be deemed null and non-confirmed; and he reserved to himself a power of correcting and reforming the articles, by the advice of the ordainers and others. These ordinances being perused and approved by the parliament, the lords and commons, as well as the mayor and aldermen of London, bound themselves by oath to observe them: towards the latter end of September, they were published by the prelates, earls, and barons, in St. Paul's church-yard, and next day in the cathedral by the king's council. They provided that the church should enjoy her franchises; and the two charters be preserved: that the customs should be collected by natives, and be payed into the exchequer: that Frenobalde and his partners<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by whom they had been hitherto farmed, should account for their receipts within a certain time, on pain of being arrested, and treated as enemies to the public: that no prizes should be taken by the king's officers without the owner's con∣sent: that the custom or duty upon wine should be no longer collected: that the jurisdi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the mareschal of the king's court should be limited to cause<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerning the servants or officers of the houshold, or such as lived within the

<P>Though the greatest part of these ordinances was confirmed before the session broke up, Edward resolved that those which struck at his prerogative
<PB N="639" REF="6480"/>
should be re-examined and corrected; and adjourned the parliament to No∣vember. To part with his darling Gaveston was like tearing the soul from the body; yet he was obliged to comply with that cruel clause, and perhaps he thought this sacrifice would prevail upon the parliament to mitigate the other articles at their next meeting: he was disappointed in his expectation. The earls of Gloucester, Lancaster, Hereford, Pembroke, Warwick, and Arundel, appeared in arms with numerous retinues, and loudly complained that Ga∣veston still lurked in Cornwal, or some of the western counties. The king or∣dered search to be made for him in those parts, for their satisfaction; but they still refused to qualify the ordinances, and the parliament was dissolved. Ga∣veston<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> had taken up his residence at Bruges in Flanders, where he lived in all the splendour of a sovereign prince, and did not doubt of being speedily re∣called from exile. Whether he did not think it safe to reside in a place under<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1312.</NOTE> the immediate influence of the French king, by whom he was detested, or received a private invitation from Edward, he returned about Christmas to York, where the king received him as usual, with demonstrations of rapture; and, in a little time after his arrival, he was declared a faithful subject, restored to his possessions, and distinguished by new favours. The barons immediately took the alarm, and raised a clamour over the whole nation. They inveighed against the presumption and arrogance of Gaveston; they accused the king of having transgressed the laws and customs of the kingdom; and charged him in particular with contempt of the late ordinances, which were zealously espoused by the people. In order to remove these impressions, the king published a pro∣clamation, assuring his subjects of his firm resolution to observe the laws, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nforce all the ordinances except such as intrenched upon his prerogative, and tended to subvert the constitution of the kingdom. That they might have no room to doubt his sincerity, he empowered the bishop of Norwich and others, to treat with the ordainers about correcting those articles that were injurious to the crown, and contrary to the nature of the commission by virtue of which they had been enacted: but the discontented party, though then assembled at London, refused to treat upon the subject in the king's absence; yet they professed themselves ready to treat with him in person, and comply with every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easonable demand for his satisfaction. This, however, was no more than a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryley<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> shew of moderation; for by this time they had resolved to humble the power of the crown, and for that purpose some of them are said to have favoured the progress of Robert de Brus in Scotland. They had certainly exceeded their com∣mission in framing the ordinances, and insisted upon some that were altogether unconstitutional; but, as they knew their own strength, they were determined to use it to the best advantage. Though the great offices of the crown were no longer in his disposal, yet even by the ordinances he was allowed to fill up the vacancies for the time being, till the meeting of the parliament; and by virtue of this power, he bestowed the post of treasurer during that interval upon Walter bishop of Litchfield, whom he had formerly persecuted. After a strict inquisition into his conduct, he had been found innocent and admitted into favour. While he was a prisoner, the earls of the opposition had inter∣ceded in his behalf; but, now that he was restored to his former office, they took umbrage at his promotion.

Having assembled a number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces at different parts, on pretence of holding tournaments, they suddenly united all their bodies, so as to compose a numerous army, and began their march for Newcastle, where the king resided, in full confidence of receiving a r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>forcement of Gascons, before the barons would proceed to extremity. His security, however, was so ill founded, that the earl of Lancaster had reached within a few miles of Newcastle, before he had the least intimation of his approach; so that he was fain to retire with precipitation to Tinmouth, where he embarked with his retinue. He set Gaveston ashore at the castle of Scarborough, one of the strongest fortresses in England, and he himself landed<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer. M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s.</NOTE> at Knaresborough; from whence he proceeded to York. The general of the barons no sooner understood the place of Gaveston's retreat, than he detached the earls of Surrey and Pembroke, Henry de Percy, and Robert de Clifford, with a body of forces to invest Scarborough, while he took post between that place and York, to cut off all communication between the king and his fa∣vourite. Edward sent orders to the barons to raise the siege; but these were s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighted, and the operations carried on with redoubled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igour. Gaveston stood several assaults; but seeing no prospect of relief, and afraid of exasperating the besiegers by an obstinate defence, he desired to capitulate, and surrendered himself to Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke, on condition of being kept in safe custody till the first of August; and in case he should not consent to the resolutions which the earls might take concerning his person, before that time, he should be restored to the state in which they found him, and put in possession of the castle which he now resigned. The king advised him to comply with these terms, in hope of being able to raise an army for his relief; and the earl of Pembroke, with Henry de Percy, obliged themselves to perform the ar∣ticles, on pain of forfeiting all their lands and tenements. Aymer proposed to convey the prisoner to his own castle of Wallingford; but left him at Deding∣ton in Oxfor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire, on pretence of passing a night with his lady, who re∣sided in the neighbourhood.

<PB N="641" REF="6500"/>
death, as an enemy to the kingdom, he was conveyed to a place called Black∣low-hill, now Gayersike, and beheaded by a Welshman provided for that pur∣pose. Lancaster is said to have viewed the head, when severed from the body, with marks of barbarous triumph: and indeed the whole of this scene was acted with cruelty and perfidiousness; for if Gaveston was actually guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, he ought to have been fairly tried by the laws of his country. The body of this unfortunate nobleman was carried to the con∣vent of the Dominican Friars at Oxford, where it lay unburied on account of the sentence of excommunication under which he died; but it was afterwards sumptuously interred at Langley in Hertfordshire. The earl of Pembroke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale.</NOTE> being suspected of collusion with those who deprived Gaveston of his life, complained loudly of the injury he had sustained; and going to the earl of Gloucester, begged that nobleman's assistance in vindicating his honour, and saving his lands from being forfeited. He expressed himself to the same pur∣pose in a convocation of the university of Oxford, and afterwards renounced the cause of the confederate barons. The king admitted his apologies, and gladly received him into his service; but as Henry de Percy did not appear at court, he was reputed guilty: his lands were forfeited according to the te∣nour of the bond he had given, and an order was issued for apprehending his person.</P>

<P>The king had, upon Gaveston's capitulation, quitted York, and pro∣ceeded as far north as Berwick, where he received the tidings of his favourite's death. The transports of his grief on this occasion were such as might have been expected from the extravagance of passion he had always expressed for Gaveston. He underwent the most violent agitations, which might have en∣dangered his life, if he had not found means to oppose his sorrow with his re∣sentment. His grief was not silent and desponding, but loud and impetuous. He denounced vengeance against the murderers of his minion, and set out immediately for London, where he was persuaded by the earl of Pembroke, Hugh le D'Espenser, the lords Beaumont and Mauley, to levy forces and re∣venge such a flagrant insult upon his royal authority. He summoned a par∣liament to meet in August, repaired to Dover, where he fortified the castle, re∣ceived the oath of allegiance from the barons of the Cinque-Ports, demanded succours from France, and returning to London, assembled a considerable body of forces. He at the same time summoned all who were possessed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon. Malm.</NOTE> of forty pounds in land, to come and receive the honour of knighthood; and appointed commissioners to treat about the ordinances at the ensuing parliament. The malecontents, however, paid no regard to the summons they had received; and, as they did not appear at the day appointed, orders were issued, forbidding them to raise forces, and prohibiting all others from joining in their rebellious measures. Notwithstanding these orders, the barons proclaimed tournaments in different counties, and levied such a number of troops as exceeded the king's army. At the head of these the earl of Lancaster advanced towards London; and a civil war must have necessarily ensued, had not the earls of Gloucester and Richmond, together wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the French ambassador and pope's nuncio, inter∣posed their good offices to prevent such a dreadful calamity. By their media∣tion a treaty was set on foot, and a safe-conduct granted to the earl of Hereford, and the lords <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Botetourt, that they might come to court and treat about an accommodation. As th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se deputies proceeded very slowly in their
<PB N="$42" REF="6510"/>
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>berations, the earl of Lancaster was furnished with a safe-conduct; and the queen being delivered of her eldest son Edward at Windsor, the king was so overjoyed at this event, that he seemed to have forgot the loss of Gaveston, and sent a message to the barons, importing that he would consent to any thing they could ask in reason. They demanded a confirmation of all the or∣dinances without exception; and a full pardon for the death of Gaveston, whom they branded with the name of a traitor. Edward at first rejected this condition; but at length the treaty was concluded on these terms: that the barons should come before the king in Westminster-hall, and ask pardon on their knees: that they should restore the effects of Gaveston which they had seized at Newcastle: that they and their adherents should have a full pardon, under the sanction of parliament, for the death of Gaveston, and the hostilities they had committed against the king; and that a like pardon should be granted to the friends and adherents of that unhappy favourite: that a provision should be made in parliament for preventing the barons from coming to such assemblies in arms, with a great number of followers, so as to endanger the peace of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that immediately after the pacification a reasonable subsidy should be granted for the maintenance of the war in Scotland; and that Henry de<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y should be restored to his honours and estate.</P>

<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>In the course of this year was held the first session of the council of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where Philip the Fair appeared in person, with three of his sons, and his brother Charles de Valois. Pope Clement gave the assembly to understand that he had convened them to consult about the recovery of the Holy Land, and the fate of the Templars, who had been seized and imprisoned all over Europe, in consequence of being charged with crimes of the most attrocious nature. In all probability, their great power and immense wealth excited the jealousy and envy of the European princes; for by this time they enjoyed sixteen thou∣sand lordships in Christendom. Such a society, independent of all govern∣ments, though their influence extended through every kingdom of Europe, could not but alarm every prince of sound policy, especially as the order gained ground every day, and increased their possessions either by purchase or bene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion. Philip the Fair dreading the progress of their power, and allured by the hope of sharing their acquisitions, found means to trump up an accusation against the whole order, containing such articles as intailed upon them the de∣testation and abhorrence of mankind. Two infamous persons who had been expelled from the order, impeached them of renouncing Christ at their ad∣mission, of spitting and trampling upon the cross, and worshipping a wooden head with a large beard. They were likewise accused of certain unnatural crimes, which it would be indecent to describe; and their pride, insolence, and voluptuous manner of living had rendered them so odious to the world in general, that no power or advocate of consequence would undertake their defence. Upon the information of those two evidences, Philip ordered all the Templars in his dominions to be seized in one day, and all their estates to be confiscated. He then tampered with the most dissolute among the prisoners, and chiefly by threats intimidated them into such a confession as would answer his purpose. He is even said to have forged confessions, and to have fraudu∣lently obtained the signature of the great master and other chiefs of the order, who being so illiterate that they could neither read nor write, set their marks to a paper which they were told was no more than an acknowledgment of some
<PB N="643" REF="6520"/>
trifling irregularities; whereas it was a full confession of the most enormous crimes. When this was afterwards read in their hearing, before the pope's commissaries, they were seized with horror and indignation, and loudly dis∣claimed the paper as a vile imposition. This declaration was deemed apostasy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and above threescore were publicly burned, professing their innocence to the last moment of their lives. Edward hearing of these proceedings, had writ in their favour to the pope, and the king of Castile, Arragon, and Sicily; but his holiness, with whom the king of France had concerted the destruction of the order, sent a letter to the king of England, desiring that all the Knights-Templars of England and Ireland should be apprehended, and all their estates sequestred in both kingdoms. Edward complied with his request, and the pope sent over two commissaries to enquire into the crimes laid to their charge: examinations were taken in different parts of the realm; but nothing appeared against them which could justify the dissolution of their order. Archbishop Winchelsey convened a provincial synod at London, in order to determine this affair, but the members could not be persuaded to condemn them, or publish the pope's excommunication, according to the direction of his holiness, in case they should be found guilty. The archbishop being in haste to set out for the council of Vienne, left the discussion of the charge of heresy to Robert de Pykering, his vicar-general, who called a new convocation, and producing the extorted confessions of seventy-two Templars who were burned at Paris, the clergy were prevailed upon to pass a censure against the knights as heretics. Each Templar was ordered to abjure all heresy; confess that he was rendered in∣famous by the pope's bull, and submit himself to the grace of God, and the ordinance of the council. In the very first session of this assembly, pope Cle∣ment, in presence of the kings of France and Navarre, having prohibited all persons, on pain of the greater excommunication, from speaking one word in that council without his permission, declared the order of Templars dissolved, by the plenitude of his power; and that he reserved their lands and effects to his own disposal. These he afterwards granted to the Knights-Hospitallers, who had lately taken the isle of Rhodes, and done great service against the in∣fidels. Two cardinals were sent to see this bull executed in England; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.

The barons<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>While Edward was embroiled with his barons in England, Robert de Brus executed his projects without opposition. He reduced the fortresses of Bute, Dumfries, and other castles in Scotland, and ravaged the English bor∣der, from whence he carried off great booty. During the succeeding winter, he took Perth by assault; Sir James Douglas surprized Roxburgh, and the castle of Edinburgh was taken by Thomas Randolph earl of Murray. Robert having thus made himself master of all the strengths in the kingdom, except Stirling, Dunbar, and Berwick, ordered his brother Edward to invest the first of these; and he attempted to surprize the latter, but miscarried through the barking of a dog, which alarmed the garrison. A treaty had been set on foot
<PB N="644" REF="6530"/>
between Edward and Robert, by the mediation of the French king; but, be∣fore he could be brought to an accommodation, Edward, who was intent upon being present at the knighthood and coronation of his queen's brother Lewis king of Navarre, set out for Paris, leaving the negotiation with the Scottish king unfinished, and the whole oeconomy of his kingdom unsettled and inse∣cure. During his residence at the court of France, he sent over a commission for the bishops of Bath and Worcester, the earls of Gloucester and Richmond, to hold a parliament in July to confirm the acts of pardon and security<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the great lords thinking themselves slighted by his absence, returned to their own homes; and though he found the parliament sitting, at his return, no business was transacted, because the earls upon whose account it had been con∣vened were withdrawn. He expected a supply, but being disappointed in that hope, dissolved the assembly, and borrowed sums of money from the bishops and abbots, to raise a body of forces against the Scots, who threatened the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> kingdom with an invasion. The great lords attending at the next parliament, were graciously received by the king, and assured of a perfect reconciliation; the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of pardon and security were passed and published; particular pardons under the great seal were granted to the earls of Lancaster, Hereford, and Warwick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and near five hundred of their adherents by name; and the barons gave their assent to an ordinance, declaring it was part of the royal prerogative to prohibit all persons from coming in arms to parliament. In this season of good humour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they voted a considerable subsidy to enable the king to maintain the war in Scotland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where the natives that still adhered to his interest were hard pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Bruss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, and had sent Patrick earl of Marche, and Adam Gordon, to sollicit immediate succours. Edward had already formed the re∣solution of marching to their relief, and raised a considerable sum of money by mortgaging the revenues of Guienne to the pope. But all these funds being insufficient to defray the expence of the meditated enterprize, he bor∣rowed two thousand marks of cardinal Tes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; and sent briefs to almost all the individual ecclesiastics of England, requiring from each a sum proportioned to his abilities. He had dismissed the Scottish deputies, with assurances of being at Berwick with all his forces by the feast of St. John the Baptist, and began to make mighty preparations for humbling Brus, who had by this time civi∣lized has subjects, formed an excellent army, and reduced the isle of Man to his obedience. His brother Edward had invested Stirling, which was natu∣rally strong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and so gallantly defended by Mowbray, that after divers as∣saults, in which the besiegers were always repulsed with great loss, both sides agreed to a cessation of arms for one year; at the expiration of which the castle should be surrendered, if not relieved before that time by the English. King Edward, in the midst of all his preparations, sailed from Dover to Boulogne; though the cause of this extraordinary voyage is altogether unknown, and re∣turning in a few days, issued writs requiring his military tenants to meet him<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mer. An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>14.</NOTE> in arms at Berwick, on the tenth day of June in the following year.</P>

<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>As the ordinances were not yet confirmed, a parliament was called for that purpose in January, when the friends of the king opposed them so strenuously, as articles destructive of the prerogative, and subversive of the constitution, that they were rejected by a majority; and for this reason the earl of Lancaster, and the barons of his party, refused to attend the king in his expedition. About this period Edward received intelligence that the Scots had
<PB N="645" REF="6540"/>
made an irruption into England, where they burned Hexham, and several towns, and not only laid the country under contribution, but compelled the inhabitants to purchase a truce, on condition that they should not for the fu∣ture oppose the Scots at any time in their invasions of England. The king was no sooner apprized of these transactions, than he issued orders to the Cinque-Ports, and maritime towns, to equip their fleet, and be at Berwick on the day of rendezvous. He sent the earl of Pembroke, as guardian of Scotland, to check the progress of the enemy in the northern counties: he wrote to the earl of Ulster to raise the Irish chieftains, with their vassals, and bring them to his assistance: he ordered new levies to be made in Yorkshire, and other parts of the kingdom; and assembled such an army as England had never brought into the field upon any former occasion. The king having kept his Easter at Ely, set out for York, and from thence proceeded to Berwick, which he reached about the beginning of June. As the time drew near for the sur∣render of Stirling, he began his march immediately for the relief of that fort∣ress; and entered Scotland at the head of one hundred thousand fighting men, attended by an incredible number of waggons and camp followers, so as to cover the whole face of the country. They marched without order, as to an assured victory, and had already parcelled out the lands of the vanquished. They were suffered to advance without molestation from Robert de Brus, who had resolved to hazard a battle; and for that purpose occupied an advantageous post in the neighbourhood of Stirling, where he did not doubt of being at∣tacked by the English. His army consisted of thirty thousand chosen men, trained up to war and hardship under his own eye and example, who were de∣termined to conquer or die in defence of their king and country. With these he took post on a piece of ground bounded on one side by a morass, and on the other by an inaccessible mountain; so that his flanks could not be at∣tacked by the enemy's cavalry. A rivulet called Bannockburn ran in his front; and this he had rendered almost impassable, by digging holes in the bed or channel, in which he fixed sharpened stakes for the destruction of the English horse. Large pits were likewise made between this rivulet and his camp, pro∣vided with the same instruments of annoyance, and artfully covered with turf and boughs to deceive the aggressors. As the van of Edward's army ap∣proached Stirling, under the command of the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Henry de Bohun, perceiving a body of Scots at the side of a wood, ad∣vanced against them with his Welsh followers, and was drawn into an ambush by Robert de Brus, who sallied in person upon them from a thicket, and riding up to Bohun cleft his skull with a battle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x. The English being reinforced from their rear, a sharp dispute ensued, in which the earl of Gloucester was dismounted, and the lord Clafford repulsed with considerable damage. As fresh supplies of men arrived from both armies, in all probability this conflict would have ended in a general engagement, had not night parted the com∣batants. The soldiers lay upon their arms, and they, as well as the horses, were so fatigued with their march, and the want of repose, that the most expe∣rienced officers in the army proposed to defer the attack until the people should be refreshed. This advice was rejected by the young nobility, who were eager to signalize their courage; and it was resolved to give battle to the enemy in the morning. The troops were accordingly drawn up in order of battle; the wings, consisting of cavalry, being commanded by the earls of Gloucester and
<PB N="646" REF="6550"/>
Hereford<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the king in person taking his station in the centre. Robert de Brus formed his army into three lines, and a body of reserve, which was commanded by Douglas and the lord high steward of Scotland. As he had little confidence in his horse, he ordered the troopers to dismount: he placed his brother Edward at the head of the right wing, Randolph conducted the left, and he himself commanded the main body. When the English army was on the point of charging, a dispute arose about the post of honour, be∣tween the earls of Gloucester and Hereford; and the former, impatient of con∣troul, advanced immediately to the charge with great impetuosity. But their career was soon stopped by the hidden pits and trenches into which the horses tumbled headlong, and were staked in a miserable manner. This unforeseen dis∣aster produced the utmost confusion; and the Scots taking advantage of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, fell upon them sword in hand, with such fury that the greatest part of them was cut in pieces. The earl of Gloucester's horse being killed, he fell to the ground, where he was immediately trodden to death; and Sir Giles de Ar∣gent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n seeing him fall, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rung forward to his rescue: but that gallant officer was slain, together with Robert de Clifford, Payen de Tibetot, and William <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> While this havock was making in the right wing of cavalry, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglish archers advanced against the right wing of the enemy, and galled them so effectually with their arrows that they were upon the point of giving ground, when Douglas and the steward, making a wheel with their body of reserve, fell upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank of the English, and routed them with great slaughter. Mean while the centre, commanded by Edward, moved on against the main body of the Scots<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and met with a very warm reception from Robert de Brus, who fought in the front of the line with unequalled valour. The English were already dispirited by the destruction of their wings, and the loss of their bravest offi∣cers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when the boys, and other followers of the Scottish camp, who viewed the battle from a neighbouring hill, perceiving the success of Douglas and the steward, began to shout aloud, and run towards the field for the sake of plun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r. The English, startled at their acclamations, and seeing such a multi∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de in motion, imagined they were succours coming to reinforce the enemy; and on this supposition betook themselves to flight with the utmost precipita∣tion. Those who attended the king hurried him off the field towards the castle of Stirling, into which, however the governor would not give him admittance, because he was obliged by his capitulation to surrender the castle to the victor; so that Edward fled to Dunbar, where he was cordially received by Patrick earl of Marche, who had always been a faithful adherent of his family. Mean while confusion, rout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and consternation, prevailed among the English forces; and victory declared for the Scottish king, who improved it to the best advan∣tage. A great number of his enemies were slain upon the spot, as well as in the pursuit; and few or none would have escaped, had not his soldiers been so intent upon the booty, which is said to have amounted in value to two hundred thousand pounds. The earl of Hereford, with John Giffard, John de Wi∣lyngton, the earl of Angus, the lords Mounthermer, Percy, Nevil, Scroope, Lucy, Acton, Latimer, Segrave, Berkley, Beauchamp, and other barons, to the number of five and twenty, were taken prisoners, together with a great multitude of bannerets and knights. The number of the slain amounted to about seven hundred lords, knights, and esquires, and twenty thousand com∣mon soldiers. Nor was the victory purchased without bloodshed on the side
<PB N="647" REF="6560"/>
of Brus, who lost above four thousand of his best men on the field of battle. Douglas was detached with four hundred cavalry to pursue Edward, who with great difficulty reached the castle of Dunbar, in such trepidation that he made a vow to found a house in Oxford for four and twenty Carmelite divines, in case he should escape the danger by which he was encompassed. As his pursuer still hovered in the neighbourhood, he would not venture to pro∣secute his journey by land; but embarked on board of a small vessel, in which he was transported to Berwick, where he thought himself secure. Robert de Brus treated the prisoners with great humanity. He expressed unfeigned sorrow for the death of Sir Giles de Argentein, to whose worth he was no stranger. The bodies of Gloucester and lord Clifford were sent to the king of England: the lord Mounthermer, as the ancient friend of Brus, was dismissed without ransom; the slain were decently interred, the wounded care∣fully attended; and the prisoners assured of liberty as soon as a reason∣able cartel could be established. Robert's moderation was altogether admirable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham. Mon. Malm. Fordun.</NOTE> Instead of prosecuting his victory by marching into England, while the whole kingdom was filled with terror and consternation, he proposed reasonable con∣ditions of peace to Edward; and commissioners were appointed by both princes to treat of an accommodation. The conferences were opened at Durham; but the Scottish deputies insisting, as a preliminary, upon the king's recog∣nizing the title of Brus, and the independence of the Scottish crown, Edward refused to treat upon such terms, and the negotiation proved ineffectual.</P>

<P>Mean while Edward having taken proper measures for the security of Berwick, repaired to York, where he convoked a parliament, to deliberate upon the state of the nation, and raise a supply adequate to the present emer∣gency: but the barons, instead of answering his expectation, complained loudly of the non-observance of the ordinances, and imputed his ill success to the advice of evil counsellors. The king finding himself involved in difficulty and distress, from which he had no prospect of being extricated, but by the assistance of parliament, was fain to comply with their demands. Hugh D'Espenser, who had succeeded to Piers Gaveston in the favour and affection of Edward, was obliged to abscond; the lord Beaumont was banished from court; the chan∣cellor, treasurer, sheriffs, and other officers, were removed, and their places filled with persons recommended by the confederate barons. The consideration of measures for the recovery of Scotland was postponed till the next parliament, on account of the absence of the noblemen who were taken prisoners at Ban∣nockburn: and that this obstacle might not retard their operations, a cartel was settled with the Scots; in consequence of which the English were ex∣changed for the wife, sister, and daughter of Robert de Brus, David earl of Mar, Robert earl of Glasgow, and other persons of note, who had been taken in the preceding reign. During this session of parliament, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> de Brus and Douglas, at the head of a strong body of forces, invaded England on the side of Berwick. They ravaged all Northumberland, laid the bishopric of Durham under contribution, and penetrating into Yorkshire, destroyed Appleby, Kirkwold, and other places. At the same time another detach∣ment entered the kingdom by Redisdale and Tindale, subdued all the country, and even compelled the inhabitants to swear allegiance to the Scottish mo∣narch.</P>

The country was not only ravaged by the enemy, but distressed with famine; and the par∣liament petitioned the king that an ordinance should be made against the mo∣nopolizers of provision. This was accordingly passed, but was next year re∣pealed, because it was sound to destroy the markets. The king confirmed the great charters, and even the late ordinances, and appointed commissioners to make perambulations through the forests. In consideration of these com∣missions, the parliament granted a twentieth of moveables, by which he was enabled to raise a considerable army: but, as the subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y was insufficient for its maintenance, he demanded loans from the religious societies of the kingdom, and issued writs fixing the proportion of this extorted ben<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>volence, by which large sums were brought into the exchequer. While Edward was thus em∣ployed in recruiting his exhausted finances, the Scots distressed the English merchants by depredations at sea; and their land-forces entering England, plundered the whole bishopric of Durham. The king, alarmed at this inva∣sion, assembled some troops, and marched as far north as Berwick; from whence he issued writs to the carl of Lancaster and Henry Percy, as well as to all his military tenants, to meet him in arms at Newcastle, in the month of August, and attend him in his purposed expedition into Scotland. His orders, however, were very ill obeyed; for the people had not yet recovered of their pannic occasioned by the defeat at Bannockburn: so that finding himself too weak to carry on an offensive war, all he could do was to visit and put the frontier places in a posture of defence. Then he returned to London, after having appointed the earl of Pembroke his lieutenant on the northern borders; and empowered the lord Edmund le Botiller justiciary of Ireland, to treat with the Irish chieftians for a body of forces to serve in the purposed invasion of Scotland. Those people, far from being disposed to contribute their assistance to such an undertaking, had already resolved to shake off the English yoke. They had long complained of the oppression under which they laboured; and the petitions which they had presented for redress had been hitherto neglected by the king and his council. No Irishman could sue in the king's court, or make a will to dispose of his effects. No female of that country, if married to an Englishman, could have her dower; the natives could not be admit∣ted into any religious order; and if an Irishman was murdered by an Eng∣lishman, the assassin was not liable to prosecution. The chiefs and nobles of Ireland had often petitioned that they might hold their lands in capite of the crown of England, and enjoy the benefit of the English laws; but their request was still r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fused. Their properties were invaded, their persons insulted, their lives taken away, and all satisfaction by the way of law and justice had been denied. They had implored the mediation of the pope, which had proved fru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, at length they so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licited the assistance of Robert de Brus, offering to acknowlege him or his bro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Edward as monarch of Ireland, and to join them with all their vassals.

He embarked with six thousand chosen men, and landing in Ulster about the beginning of May, was
<PB N="649" REF="6580"/>
joined by a good number of the Irish, who considered him as their deliverer. His first attempt was against Dundalk, which he reduced; then he ravaged Urgyle, and drove the English out of Ulster. The justiciary assembled a body of forces to oppose his progress, and these taking the field under the command of the earl of Ulster, were defeated near Coleraine. Edward de Brus, after this victory, besieged and took Carrick-Fergus; and then almost all the native Irish in the kingdom, declared against the English government. Roger d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mortimer having levied a fresh army, gave battle to the Scots at Henlis, in Meath, where he was routed with great slaughter. The victor reduced seve∣ral places in the neighbourhood, and afterwards subdued the county of Kildare, before the justiciary was in a condition to take the field; at length he marched against him, and was defeated in a pitched battle near Skitheries.</P>

<P>While Edward de Brus proceeded with great rapidity in his con∣quest of Ireland, his brother Robert invaded Cumberland, and undertook the siege of Carlile, which was so gallantly defended by Andrew de Harcla, that he was obliged to abandon the enterprize, after having been repulsed in divers assaults, and lost several officers of distinction. There seems to have been a formed design of distressing the English at this juncture, by attacking them in three different quarters; for, exclusive of the descent upon Ireland, an insurrection was raised in Glamorganshire by Llewellyn Bren, who had enjoyed a consider∣able post under the late earl of Gloucester. Having been deprived of his of∣fice at the death of that nobleman, he resented his dismission so highly, that he resolved to employ all his influence, which was very extensive, in engaging the Welsh in a rebellion. He in a little time found himself at the head of ten thousand men, with whom he surprized the castle of Caer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy: but the earl of Hereford, and the other lords of the Marches, assembling their vassals; and being reinforced by a body of forces sent thither by the king, under the com∣mand of W. de Montacute, Llewellyn took refuge in the mountains; from whence he detached parties to fall upon the English stragglers, till at length he was beset on all hands, and proposed a capitulation; which being refused, he surrendered at discretion. The king, however, thought proper to pacify the discontents of the Welsh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by granting them certain indulgencies and privi∣leges which they had not formerly enjoyed. The fines paid by the tenants to their lords, for the marriages of their daughters, were moderated. Freeholders were allowed to put their sons in holy orders without the king's licence, and to alienate their lands for three years; and orders were given to observe the ordinances of Kennington all over the principality. Nor did Edward neglect<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Rymer.</NOTE> such measures as he thought conducive to the preservation of Ireland. He sent a commission to John de Hotham for raising money by the sale of wardships and marriages belonging to the crown, in that country, to levy troops against the Scottish invaders; promised encouragement to all those who should signa∣lize themselves in the course of the war, and ordered the justiciary to remove all officers that seemed unqualified for the places they filled. At this p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d too the king issued a writ for expelling all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemings that were in the king∣dom; and he sent orders to all the magi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rates of his French dominion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to break o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercourse with that people, because they were considered in the light of rebels to the king of France, with whom Edward was at this j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cture very closely conn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted: but the expulsion o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemings was grounded upon an article of the treaty between Edward I. of England, and Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip the Fair

<P>A parliament being summoned to meet at Lincoln, the king de∣clared from the throne, that he had assembled them to consult about the most proper means to reduce the rebels of Scotland: but his speech was coldly re∣ceived, and the members, without paying any regard to that subject, proceeded immediately to the consideration of means to mitigate the famine, which by this time raged all over England. Edward had procured leave from the king of France, for the merchants of Newcastle to buy up provisions in his domi∣nions; and now the act made in the last session for regulating the price of pro∣vision was repealed. When this point was discussed, the king, of his own free motion, issued writs enforcing the observance of all the ordinances and peram∣bulations; and the parliament granted a very extraordinary supply for the maintenance of the Scottish war. Every village or hamlet in the kingdom was taxed at one stout soldier well armed and accoutred, and furnished with sub∣sistence for sixty days; at the expiration of which, he should be maintained by his majesty. Market-towns were rated at a greater expence, according to their size and ability; but with an express declaration that this aid should not be drawn into a precedent: and the towns, boroughs, and cities, of the king's de∣mesnes were exempted from the imposition. The king summoned all the mi∣litia of England to the rendezvous at Newcastle upon Tyne, about Midsum∣mer; and to defray the expedition, the knights, citizens, and burgesses, granted a fifteenth of all their moveables. Edward now acted by the advice of his parliament; and to convince them of his sincere intention to govern according to the fundamentals of the constitution, and live in harmony with the noble∣men and barons, he, by the mouth of the bishop of Norwich, proposed a re∣conciliation between himself and the earl of Lancaster, whom he invited to preside in his councils. That nobleman complied with the invitation, and was appointed commander in chief of all the forces destined for the Scottish expe∣dition; and writs were issued, commanding all persons who possessed a knight's fee, or fifty pounds a year in land, whether holding of the king or other su∣periors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> to come and receive the order of knighthood. The clergy at this par∣liament granted no subsidy, excusig themselves on account of the famine, which by this time had filled the whole country with horror, death, and deso∣lation. The wealthiest noblemen were obliged to dismiss the greatest part of their domestics. The highways were infested with robbery and murder: the streets and public places exhibited the most dismal scenes of misery and dis∣tress. Numbers of wretched creatures were seen fainting and dying for want of subsistence; and helpless parents lying in the last agonies, surrounded by their tender offspring, clamorous for food. The prisons were burst open, and the malefactors devoured by the desperate populace; the dead became a prey to the living; the graves were robbed of their tenants to allay the rage of hunger; and to such a degree of horror did this calamity encrease, that even the mother was known to destroy and feed upon the fruit of her own womb. This dreadful visitation could not fail to render the prosecution of the war im∣practicable. A kind of army was levied, and marched, under the command of Lancaster, as far as New<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stle; but this parade was not designed for ser∣vice, so much as for giving weight to a negociation which was now set on foot
<PB N="651" REF="6600"/>
between the two nations. The earl of Angus, Maurice Berkley, and Richard Horsly, were commissioned to conclude a truce with the enemy, and confe∣rences began; but whether the Scots were too high in their demands, or Edward too inflexible, considering the miserable situation of his country, the treaty miscarried, and the season was lost. The day of rendezvous had been shifted from May till August, in hope that the truce would have rendered it un∣necessary; and some historians alledge that the earl of Lancaster acted in concert with Robert de Brus, who did not fail to take advantage of the en∣feebled state to which England was by this time reduced. About Midsum∣mer the Scottish forces penetrated into Yorkshire, and laid the inhabitants un∣der contribution: then they ravaged the country for sixty miles, in such a manner as rendered it impracticable for the English army to find the least sub∣sistence in their march; and returning to Scotland with a vast booty, com∣pleted the misery of England.</P>

<P>Robert was so little afraid of any effort that Edward could make to the prejudice of his kingdom, that he left Douglas guardian or regent of the realm, and crossed the sea to Ireland with a strong body of forces, in order to complete the conquest of that country. His brother had received a check from the justiciary, and retired to Ulster, where he was detained by a famine equal to that of England, which disabled him from prosecuting his success. He had, however, assumed the title of king, and established a system of civil government; his brother Robert arriving with such a powerful reinforce∣ment, he considered the expulsion of the English as an enterprize already at∣chieved, and was solemnly crowned king of Ireland at Dundalk. They were joined by the O Neals, O Connors, and other Irish septs, and penetrated into the heart of the country; but failed in their attempt upon Dublin: and far from reaping any advantage from the expedition, Robert had the mortification to see his forces daily diminished by sickness and famine, which was so severe that he and his troops were obliged to feed upon the flesh of dogs and horses, till at length he thought proper to abandon the enterprize, and return to his domi∣nions, leaving Edward still in possession of Ulster. In all probability a prince of Robert's sagacity would not have embarked in such a romantic undertaking, if he had not received some assurances of his own kingdom's being left in quiet during his absence. It was observed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that when the Scots ravaged the northern counties of England, they always spared the lands and vassals belonging to the earl of Lancaster; and this circumstance subjected that nobleman to a sus∣picion that he corresponded with the king of Scotland. His subsequent conduct seemed to confirm this conjecture: for he did not appear at the general rendez∣vous in August; and the king's orders were neglected in the same manner by all the earl's adherents. Edward having repaired to Newcastle, was provoked by this instance of disobedience, at a time when such a fair opportunity offered of reducing Scotland, exposed as it was by the absence of Brus and his ve∣terans. He issued new orders to Lancaster and the other barons, to appear at Newcastle on the sixth day of October, and summoned all freeholders to the northward of the Trent, possessing fifty pounds a year and upwards, to come with their horses and arms to assist in the expedition to Scotland, on pain of forfeiture. Whether they obeyed this peremptory summons, historians do<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Scot. Rymer.</NOTE> not declare: but he certainly made some attempts upon Scotland, in which he was unsuccessful. He was worsted in several encounters by Douglas, and

Such an outrage must have been very provoking to
<PB N="653" REF="6620"/>
the earl of Lancaster, a prince of the royal blood, the first subject in England, and a man of a proud, imperious temper; but what completed his mortifica∣tion, and incensed him to the highest pitch of anger and revenge, was the be∣haviour of the countess, who avowed her own shame, and joined in the pro∣secution. He looked upon the deformed knight as a tool of the earl of Surrey, and suspected the king of being concerned in this plot against his honour and his fortune. He denounced vengeance against both, and assembled an army of eighteen thousand men, in order to chastise the ravisher of his wife, and those by whom he was countenanced and abetted. Edward being in no con∣dition to cope with such an adversary, had recourse to negotiation; and some efforts were made by moderate people to prevent the calamities of civil war: but these proving ineffectual, the queen desired the legates to interpose their good offices towards an accommodation; which was accordingly effected at Leicester, with all the exterior marks of sincerity. But this peace was not of long duration; for their mutual rancour was too personal and immoderate to admit of a thorough reconciliation; and the creatures of both fomented the animosity by false insinuations. Among other stories calculated for this pur∣pose, the adherents of Lancaster pretended that he detected a certain knight in his way to Scotland, with a writing, in which the king offered Robert de Brus his own terms, if he would compass the death of the earl of Lancaster. This report, though extremely improbable, had great weight with the common people, as well as another circulated at the same time, and implying that Ed∣ward had formed the design of surprising the earl by treachery, at his castle of Pontefract. Edward had the misfortune to be despised, distrusted, and even hated by his subjects, who complained that he had broken his engagements, and that therefore they could not depend upon his promise. They now de∣sired<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1318.</NOTE> the legates would employ their influence with him, for a confirmation of the ordinances, and the great charters of liberties, without those salvos for the prerogative, which in effect destroyed the purpose of his concession. He amused them with a general answer, and issued writs for a new parliament to meet at Lincoln, where he promised his subjects should receive ample satis∣faction; and the cardinals being strangers to his character, as well as to the constitution of the kingdom, were extremely well pleased with his condescen∣sion. They made some fruitless attempts in favour of the papal power, and even hinted that there was a bull on the anvil for prohibiting pluralities, and reserving the benefices to be filled up by his holiness; but finding this motion strenuously opposed both by king and people, they returned to Italy, after having sulminated the sentence of excommunication and interdict against the king and the kingdom of Scotland.</P>

<P>These censures seem to have had very little effect upon the fortune of Robert, who having made all the necessary preparations for the siege of Berwick, invested that fortress, which he is said to have reduced by tampering with the governor. After the reduction of that important frontier, he over∣ran Northumberland, in which he took the cartles of Werk, Harbottle, and Medford, together with an immense booty; and he was no sooner returned to his dominions, than he sent Douglas with a body of forces to make an irrup∣tion into another part of England. That nobleman penetrated into Yorkshire, where he burned the towns of Northallerton and Borough-bridge, and laid the inhabitants of Rippon under contribution. Then they reduced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arborough
<PB N="654" REF="6630"/>
and Shipton to ashes, and, together with their plunder, carried a great num∣ber of prisoners into Scotland. The king apprehending that the earl of Lan∣caster would come in arms to the parliament at Lincoln, in which case some disturbance might ensue, resolved if possible to compromise all matters in dis∣pute with that nobleman, by a treaty which was now set on foot; the meeting of the parliament was prorogued to the month of July, the place altered to Northampton. In this interval, an impostor, in all probability distracted in his brain, laid claim to the crown by hereditary right, as the true son of the late king, alledging that he had been exchanged while at nurse, for the person who now swayed the sceptre. He made a public declaration to this effect at Oxford, where he was imprisoned by the chancellor of the university; and from thence removed to Northampton, where, still persisting in his extra∣vagant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trivet. Cont.</NOTE> assertion, he was tried, condemned, and executed as a traitor. Ed∣ward was extremely unwilling to confirm the ordinances; and the earl of Lan∣caster as obstinately insisted upon that article as a preliminary of the treaty. Perhaps the negotiation would have proved fruitless, had not the invasion of the Scots alarmed the king to such a degree, that he thought he could not buy an accommodation too dear at such a critical conjuncture. He therefore agreed to confirm the ordinances, in whatever manner the barons should propose, and consent to a provision, by which eight bishops, four earls, and as many barons, were appointed for his standing council; four of them to attend quarterly in their turns, and direct the king with their advice in all his transactions during the intervals of parliament. It was agreed that the earl and his adherents should have a free pardon for all breaches of the peace and felonies; and that he should grant release and acquittance to all persons who had done him injury, excepting, however, all suits and actions depending between him and the earl of Surrey. Several bishops, earls, and barons, undertook for the performance of these articles, which were signed in August, and afterwards confirmed in parliament. Lancaster and Warenne were reconciled, Hugh D'Espenser the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Mon.

<P>After this accommodation was finished, Edward, intent upon an expedition against the Scots, repaired to York, where he called a parliament, in which the agreement and pardon were ratified; and here he received the agreeable tidings of a total overthrow sustained by Edward de Brus in Ireland. The archbishop of Dublin having been vested with the office of justiciary, had appointed the lord John Bermingham general of the English forces in that king∣dom, which were reinforced by succours from England. Brus still continued in Ulster, and his brother Robert desired he would not quit his post, or hazard an encounter, until he should bring a body of forces to his assistance. Edward, over-boiling with an impetuosity of courage that bordered upon temerity, and intoxicated with the dreams of ambition, could not brook a participation of glory, and resolved to strike some grand stroke before his brother's arrival. With this view he advanced against the English at the head of a small body, not exceeding six thousand Scots and Irish, and being encountered near Dun∣dalk by Bermingham with a numerous army, was totally defeated, and lost<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals of Ire∣land.

<P>The king, animated by the news of this victory, which put an end to the Irish war, resolved to improve his good fortune by making an im∣mediate irruption into Scotland. He assembled a large body of forces, and a numerous fleet to supply them with provisions in the enemy's country; but the barons were averse to a winter campaign, and the clergy refused to grant a subsidy without the pope's licence: he was therefore obliged to delay his expe∣dition till the spring; and in the mean time sent Hugh D'Espenser the elder to complain at the court of Rome, that the Scots were encouraged to expect a suspension of the censures they had incurred. Edward at the same time ex∣postulated with the earl of Flanders, between whose subjects and the English the former correspondence had been renewed, complaining that he countenanced Robert de Brus, and allowed the Scots to trade in his dominions: and he made bitter complaints to all his allies on the continent who recognized that prince as a sovereign. But his remonstrances had no effect to the prejudice of Robert, who was by this time acknowledged and esteemed by the greatest princes in Europe. In a parliament which met at York after Easter, a large subsidy was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1319.</NOTE> granted by the nobility, freeholders, cities, and boroughs; and the clergy in convocation voted a tenth of their revenues, having by this time obtained the pope's permission. The tenth day of June was fixed for the rendezvous of the army, and all the military vassals of the crown were summoned to appear in arms at Newcastle: all the great lords and barons attended with a great num∣ber of horse; and as the king had by proclamation granted to every soldier the booty he should take, not exceeding one hundred pounds, a prodigious multi∣tude of infantry assembled at the time and place appointed. Edward began his march from Newcastle in July, and invested the town of Berwick by land, while it was blocked up by sea in such a manner by the fleet of the Cinque-Ports, that it could not possibly receive any succours or provision. The ope∣rations of the siege were carried on with great vigour and alacrity, and the place was defended with equal courage by the great steward of Scotland, son∣in-law of Robert de Brus, who sustained several desperate assaults; in some of which the English had actually mounted the ramparts. They were so ad∣vantageously posted, that Robert could not attack them with any prospect of success; and therefore he resolved to make a diversion in favour of the be∣sieged. The queen resided in a village near York, little dreaming she was in any danger from the Scots, who were supposed to be too much engrossed by the defence of their own country, to spare troops for an expedition into Eng∣land. Robert formed a plan for surprising this princess; and the lord Douglas being charged with the execution, advanced with a body of chosen men to∣wards the place of his destination. But the design miscarried: for one of his spies being apprehended at York, was put to the torture, and disclosed his in∣tention; so that the queen was removed to York, and from thence conveyed to Nottingham. The archbiship being determined to surprize the Scots in his turn, assembled his tenants, vassals, and clergy, to the number of ten thou∣sand, and marched silently for York, towards Milton on the Swale, where, by the information of the spy, he knew the enemy would be quartered on that day. Douglas, however, was too vigilant an officer to suffer himself to be surprized. His men were already in order of battle; and, as the English ap∣proached with the wind in their faces, he ordered a great quantity of wet s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raw to be kindled. They were immediately blinded by the smoke; and

and a law was now made for bringing the perpetrators of these enor∣mities to condign punishment. The Flemings had supplied the Scots with arms and provisions, notwithstanding the king's repeated remonstrances against that unfair practice. They had even committed depredations upon the English at sea; and all the measures taken to adjust these matters had proved ineffectual. The parliament taking this affair into consideration, it was resolved that the king of England was lord of the British seas; and that all goods and mer∣chandize taken from the English within those seas, ought to be reputed as taken within the realm; and the captors tried by the king's justices: that suits concerning these depredations should be determined according to law and rea∣son; and that all persons present at such depredations, and knowingly receiv∣ing the prize-goods in whole or in part, should be charged and punished ac∣cordingly.</P>

<P>The community of Scotland had writ a letter to the pope, stating the difference between them and the English, and solliciting his holiness not only to remove the interdict which he had laid upon the kingdom, but also to absolve Robert de Brus, and employ his good offices to terminate in an equitable manner the war which had raged so long, to the unspeakable preju∣dice of both nations. Though the pope did not comply with the former part of their request, he directed a bull to Edward, exhorting him to restore peace to the island; and he accordingly appointed commissioners to treat with the Scottish deputies. The king of France desired that his ambassadors might assist at the conferences; but Edward declined granting this request, because he had reason to think Philip was biassed in favour of the enemy; and the ne∣gotiation proved ineffectual. The populace of London had risen against the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1321.</NOTE> magistrates, on pretence of being unequally assessed, and other grievances; and in one of their riots a Lombard had lost his life. Some itinerant justices were ordered to hold a court in the Tower, and enquire into these disorders; when the ringleaders of the riots were tried and punished according to their demerits. The mayoralty of the city was seized into the hands of the king, and Robert de Kendal appointed guardian. Though the liberties were soon restored, this transaction produced loud clamours among the citizens, who looked upon their being summoned to a court in the Tower as an infringe∣ment of their privileges, which they imputed to the evil counsel of the two D'Espensers, against whom they expressed the most implacable resentment. These two ministers were now become odious to the whole nation. The fa∣ther was a brave warrior, a wise counsellor, and of an unexceptionable cha∣racter, in every other respect but his attachment to his son, who trod in the foot∣steps of his predecessor Gaveston, and greatly resembled that favourite in his personal endowments, as well as in his pride and ambition. He had been at first forced upon the king by the earl of Lancaster, as chamberlain of the houshold; in which capacity he had ingratiated himself with Edward by his personal beauty and obsequious behaviour, until he gained such an ascendency over him as Gaveston had formerly possessed. Then he began to direct all the measures of the government with the most arbitrary influence; and, from a dependent, became the rival of Lancaster. Perhaps his greatest crime was his opposition to that popular and turbulent nobleman. Not but that he made a very bad use of his power. He had married Eleanor, one of the coheiresses of Gilbert de Clare, late earl of Gloucester, and in right of this
<PB N="658" REF="6670"/>
lady, enjoyed the best part of Glamorganshire: but his avarice being insatiable, he encroached upon the shares of the other sisters; and even usurped the lands belonging to other proprietors. He seized the castle of Newport from Hugh de Audeley, who married one of his sisters-in-law; and afterwards, by dint of threats, extorted a conveyance from him, to confirm his possessions: he like∣wise pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed upon the king to resume the grants of some castles he had be∣stowed upon Roger de Mortimer, and appropriated them to his own use and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</NOTE> convenience. But no part of his conduct gave such offence as his dispute with John de Mowbray, who had had married Aliva, daughter of William de Braouse, lord of Gower. This nobleman had, by a special deed, granted the lands and honour of Gower to his daughter and son-in-law Mowbray, and to the heirs of their bodies lawfully begotten, with remainder to Humphrey Bo∣hun earl of Hereford<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and his heirs. Mowbray, by virtue of this deed, took possession fo the land without any licence from the king, of whom it held in capite; and young D'Espenser made use of this pretence to obtain judgment, by which the lands were forfeited.</P>

<P>The lords of the Marches stood up in defence of their privileges, and resolved to oppose the measures of this rapacious favourite, who seemed bent upon depriving them all of their possessions. Hugh de Audeley was glad of an opportunity to recover his castle of Newport; Roger Damory, who had married the third coheiress of Gloucester, seemed to dread the same injustice; Roger de Mortimer resented the resumption; John de Mowbray and the earl of Hereford were deeply interested against him, for his attempt to seize the land of Gower; Roger de Clifford thought himself injured in a transaction between his mother and D'Espenser, about the estate of Thomas de Clare; and the other barons of the Marches espoused the quarrel of these noblemen, either out of fear and hatred of the minister, or affection and attachment to the con∣federates. As they could not expect redress in a legal way, they resolved to take vengeance upon Hugh by force of arms, and sollicited the assistance of the earl of Lancaster, which was promised without hesitation. They began to cabal among other noblemen, and assemble in different places, to concert measures for the execution of their design, notwithstanding the orders of the king, who prohibited these seditious conventicles. At length they took the field, and sent a message to the king, demanding that he would dismiss Hugh le D'Espenser, or commit him to safe custody, that he might be forthcoming to answer for the crimes and misdemeanors laid to his charge; otherwise they would renounce their allegiance, and do justice on the criminal by their own authority. Edward, shocked at this intimation, repaired to Gloucester, where he ordered the malecontents to attend him; but they refused to appear. Then he proceeded to Bristol, in order to provide for the security of those parts, and crush the confederacy in the bud. But all he could do was to reduce an in∣considerable castle belonging to Roger Damory, and order the lands of Hugh de Audeley to be confiscated. He no sooner set out on his return to London, than the malecontents besieged and took Newport-castle, which they delivered to the right owner: they found no difficulty in reducing all the strengths belonging to D'Espenser, who was so detested in Wales that the people, even his own vassals, would not act in his defence. The barons there∣fore ravaged all Glamorganshire without opposition, and committed the most barbarous excesses.</P>

<P>Some of the king's council advised Edward to retort these vio∣lences upon the lands of the barons; but the majority apprehending that such reprisals would inflar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e matters to a civil war, it was judged more expedient to issue a proclamation to forbid the continuance of hostilities, and to call a par∣liament at Westminster, where complaints might be heard, and justice done to the injured. Mean while the confederate barons marched to Sherburn in Yorkshire, where they engaged in an association with the earl of Lancaster and his adherents, and signed an instrument obliging themselves to exert their ut∣most power in the prosecution of the two D'Espensers. Then they advanced with a numerous army towards London, committing terrible ravages in their march; and when they reached St. Albans, sent a message to the king, insist∣ing upon the banishment of the father and son, and an indemnity for them∣selves. Edward replied that the father was employed abroad, and the son doing his duty at sea, in guarding the Cinque-Ports; that he could not, with any regard to justice, banish them before they were heard; that they were ready to answer for themselves when legally charged with the breach of any law or statute; and that he himself was restrained by his coronation-oath from pardoning rebels and perturbators of the public peace. The barons, incensed at this answer, marched immediately towards London, and took up their quar∣ters about Clerkenwell and Holborn, while the king remained in a defenceless condition at Westminster, to which he had summoned a parliament, that was then sitting. The confederates drew up articles of impeachment against the two D'Espensers, charging them with having misled the king by their evil counsels. They accused the son of an attempt to draw John de Giffard and Richard de Grey, two of the discontented barons, into a conspiracy; for compelling the king to act according to his direction; of having put Llewellyn to death after he had surrendered at discretion; of procuring unjust grants of wardships; of insolence to the king and the nobles; of turning good ministers and officers out of their places, and filling them with his own creatures; of seizing the lands belonging to Hugh de Audeley; of prosecuting John de Mowbray on pretence of his having forseited the land of Gower; and of persuading the king to hinder the barons to resume the lands which their ancestors had granted to the Knights-Templars. This impeachment being prepared, they carried it to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un. M.

When it had thus received the approbation of the assembly, it was enacted in form of a statute, that both the D'Espensers had forseited their estates, and should be condemned to perpetual exile, unless recalled by the common consent of the king, prelates, and lords in parliament. The male∣contents, conscious of the illegality of their proceedings, demanded a pardon and indemnity, which was granted in the most ample form, and confirmed in parliament. The sentence against the D'Espensers was published: the eld<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> continued abroad, and the younger committed pyracies at sea; while the ba∣rons returned to their homes, though they still kept themselves in a posture of defence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The king had not digested this affront and violence offered to his person and prerogative, when his resentment was still more inflamed by a fresh insult upon his royal dignity.

He was not himself in the castle; but his wife refused admittance to the queen, or any person whatever, without an order from her husband; and told the domestics they might go and provide lodging for their mistress in some other place; for they should not enter her castle. The queen went in person to the gate, and not only met with a repulse, but saw six of her attendants killed by the garrison. Incensed at this outrage, she complained to the king, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>manded reparation for the affront she had undergone. Edward readily entered into her resentment, and assembling a body of forces, invested the castle, which was well provided with all necessaries to sustain a siege. The barons of the Welsh Marches advanced as far as Kingston in their way to the relief of the place: but the earl of Lancaster, who hated Badlesmere, refusing to send the suc∣cours they sollicited<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they found themselves too weak to give the king battle: the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they proposed that hostilities should cease until a parliament could be assembled; but this proposal being rejected, they thought proper to retire.

<P>The eld<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r D'Espenser, encouraged by the success of this enter∣prize, which seemed to denote such courage and resolution in Edward as he had never observed before, returned from exile in the beginning of November, and was very cordially received by his sovereign. The earl of Lancaster was no sooner informed of his return, than he loudly inveighed against his pre∣sumption, as well as the perfidy of Edward, upon whose promise, and even oath, his subjects could not depend. He summoned all the barons to meet him at Doncaster, and resolved to call in a body of Scots to their assistance. Circular letters were sent over all England to spirit up the people to a revolt; and the castle of Warwick, belonging to the king during the minority of earl Thomas, was seized by the malecontents. The king, by proclamation, forbade all meetings and associations, contrary to law and the peace of the kingdom: the younger D'Espenser now returned to England, and presented a petition, complaining of the illegal sentence which had been pronounced against him, and offering to assert his own innocence against all accusation. He was com∣mitted to custody, and his estate taken into the royal protection, until he should have the benefit of a fair trial. His petition was considered by the prelates belonging to the province of Canterbury, assembled at London, who condemned the sentence as erroneous and unjust: then Hugh was set at liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> and re-admitted into the king's council. Edward finding himself supported by the earls of Kent, Richmond, Pembroke, Arundel, Norfolk, Surrey, Athol, and many other noblemen of great influence, resolved to assert his authority and prerogative, by chastising the confederate barons. He reduced all the castles belonging to Badlesmere and his associates, in the neighbourhood of London; and having assembled a numerous army, marched in the middle of winter towards the frontiers of Wales, taking in his route all the fortresses pos∣sessed by his enemies. The lords of the Marches had seized the town and castle of Gloucester, burned those of Elmsly and Henley, and ravaged the ad∣jacent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>22.</NOTE> country. The king passed his Christmas at Cirencester, then marched
<PB N="661" REF="6700"/>
to Worcester, and from thence to Shrewsbury; but in his route a detachment which he had sent before him to Bridgnorth, was surprized and cut off, and the town reduced to ashes by the barons, who had drawn their forces on that side to oppose the king's progress. Nevertheless they found themselves too weak to hazard an encounter with Edward's army; and being afraid to coop themselves up in castles, lest they should meet with the fate of the garrison of Ledes, part of them submitted to the king's mercy, while the earl of Hereford, with the remainder, marched northward to join the earl of Lancaster. Of those who submitted, the two Mortimers were sent to the Tower; Maurice Berke∣ley and Hugh Audeley were committed to the castle of Wallingford, and the rest imprisoned in different parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Edward having thus triumphed over all opposition in the Marches of Wales, seized into his own hands all the castles and estates of the rebels, secured the peace of the country, and ordered all the prelates to send their pro∣portions of horse and foot to join his army at Coventry. In the mean time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon. Malm.</NOTE> the truce with Scotland being expired, Thomas Randolph earl of Murray, and the lord James Douglas, entered Northumberland with a body of forces, and ad∣vancing to Corbridge, desolated the whole country. This incursion is said to have been made at the desire of the earl of Lancaster, who sent John de Mow∣bray, and Roger de Clifford, to conclude a formal treaty between Robert de Brus and the earls of Lancaster and Hereford, with their allies. This confe∣deracy being established, the earl of Hereford invested the castle of Tykehill, belonging to the crown; but the king advancing to the relief of the place, he raised the siege, and joining Lancaster, took post at Burton upon Trent, to prevent Edward's crossing the river. They took possession of the bridge, which they maintained three days successively against the attacks of the royal army. At length the king forded the river a good way above the bridge, and Lancaster resolved to give him battle. For that purpose he marched against him with great confidence and alacrity; but when he perceived the great superiority in the number of the enemy, which amounted to thirty thousand, his heart failed him, and he retired northwards with great precipitation. Robert lord Holland coming up with a reinforcement of five hundred men to the earl immediately after his retreat, and concluding he was defeated and taken, submitted to the king, and was sent prisoner to Dover. The castles of Kenilworth and Tut∣bury surrendered at discretion; and the earls of Kent and Surrey pursued the fugitives to Pontefract-castle, belonging also to the earl of Lancaster, who threw in a reinforcement, and continued his flight in hope of finding refuge in the Scottish army: but when he reached Borough-bridge, he found Sir Simon Warde, and Sir Andrew de Harcla, governors of York and Carlile, ready to oppose his passage, at the head of an army which they had raised for that pur∣pose by his majesty's order. Lancaster and Hereford finding themselves thus hemmed in between two bodies of the enemy, resolved to force the bridge be∣fore their pursuers should come up; and, though they miscarried in their at∣tempt, Hereford and his men forded the river; but he was slain before he could mount his horse on the other side, and his followers repulsed with Ro∣ger de Clifford, who retired into the town very dangerously wounded. Lan∣caster endeavoured to pass at another ford; but finding it guarded by the enemy, he attempted to bribe Harcla to connive at his passage. That officer rejecting all his offers with disdain, he concluded a truce with him till next
<PB N="662" REF="6710"/>

Harcia was joined in the night by the sheriff of Yorkshire, and entering the town early in the morning, took Lancaster, with above a hundred barons, bannerets, and knights, without the least resistance. Besides these, a great number of gentle∣men were taken and conveyed to York; though many changed their apparel for rags, and escaped in the disguise of beggars.</P>

He proceeded to the earl's castle of Pontefract, which surrendered upon the first news of his misfortune; and sending for the prisoner from York, ordered him to be lodged one night in a tower which he was said to have built as a prison for his majesty. He was now forsaken by his popularity, in such a manner that his own vassals insulted him in the streets of Pontefract, through which he was conveyed to the castle. They reviled him in the most abusive terms, and in derision stiled him king Arthur, a fictitious name which he assumed in his correspondence with Scotland. In the morning after his arrival, he was brought into the presence of the king, who upbraided him with his pride, in∣solence, and treason. A kind of court-martial being constituted by the earls of Kent, Richmond, Pembroke, Surrey, Arundel, Athol, and Angus, he was found guilty of appearing in arms against the king at Burton and Bo∣rough-bridge, and condemned to be drawn, hanged, and quartered, as a traitor. In consideration of his being a prince of the blood, the sentence was changed into decapitation, and executed immediately after condemnation, with all the marks of disgrace, by way of retaliation for the death of Gaveston. He was mounted upon a meagre horse, without saddle or bridle, conveyed through Pontefract with a hood upon his head, to an eminence at the distance of a mile from the town; there he was ordered to stand with his face towards Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingham. M. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Mon. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</NOTE> and beheaded by a Londoner. The same sentence was denounced against Warin de L'Isle, William Touchet, Thomas Maudnet, Henry de Brade∣bourn, William Fitz-Williams, William Cheyney, Josselin de Deinville, and the lords Mowbray and Clifford, who underwent the pains and penalties of the law without mitigation. The life of Hugh de Audeley was saved, be∣cause he had married the king's niece: John de Botetourt, John de Kingston, Nicholas de Piercy, John de Montravers, and William Tansel, escaped to the continent. The lord Badlesmere, and Bertram de Ashburnam, were hanged, drawn, and quartered at Canterbury. Sir T. Colepepper suffered the same death at Winchelsey; John Giffard and Sir Roger Elmesbruge were executed at Gloucester; Stephen Barret at Swaneseye; William Fleming at Cardiff; H. de Tyeys at London; Sir Francis Aldenham at Windsor, and others<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leland.</NOTE> at different places of the kingdom. This hecatomb being devoted to the ven∣geance of the king and his ministers, the earl of Pembroke was gratified with a grant of the New Temple, which had belonged to Lancaster; the lands of Clifford, Mowbray, and Damory, were divided between the earl of Richmond and the bishop of Durham; the losses sustained by the eldest D'Espenser, from the depredations of the barons, were compensated by several rich manours; and the son not only engrossed a great number of the forfeited estates, but also ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted immense sums by way of composition from those who were pardoned.
<PB N="663" REF="6720"/>
His behaviour on this occasion displayed such cruelty and avarice as rendered him more odious than ever to the nation; and in the end proved the ruin of himself and his master, whose favour he so shamefully abused. Before the action at Borough-bridge, the king had issued writs for a parliament to meet at York in May, when all the ordinances which he had been compelled to pass, were abolished; and the process against the two D'Espensers was revised and repealed. The elder was created earl of Winchester, and Andrew de Harcla rewarded for his services with the earldom of Carlile.</P>

<P>Edward having resolved upon an expedition into Scotland, sum∣moned his military tenants to meet him at Newcastle in July; and the parlia∣ment voted a subsidy for the expence of that enterprize. Every village was taxed at one foot soldier, and the great towns at a greater number, to be main∣tained forty days at the expence of the inhabitants: the barons, knights, and freeholders, granted a tenth; and the cities, boroughs, and towns of ancient demesne, a sixth of their moveables. Nor were the clergy backward in grant∣ing an aid for the purposes of this armament. While Edward was employed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale. Rymer. Mat. West.</NOTE> in making preparations, Robert de Brus and his two generals Murray and Douglas, entered England at different places, and penetrated as far as Lancashire, where they joined to ravage the country, from whence they carried off immense plunder by the way of Carlile. The king having assembled a numerous army, and equipped a powerful fleet, the command of which was given to Robert Ley∣burn, a sailor of great courage and experience, he marched into Scotland, where he found the country desolated by order of Brus, who had removed all his sub∣jects, with their effects, to the northward of the Forth, that the English might find no subsistence in his country. Edward advanced as far as Edinburgh, without seeing the face of an enemy; and his fleet being detained by contrary winds, he began to be grievously distressed for want of provisions. After having wrestled some time with that difficulty, he pillaged some convents, and re∣turned towards his own country; attended by Robert de Brus, at the head of his forces, who harrassed him in his march, and even followed him into England, intercepting his convoys and surprising his detachments. At length both armies engaged near the abbey of Bycland, and Edward being routed, escaped with difficulty to York: but all his furniture, plate, and money, together with the earl of Richmond, fell into the hands of the Scots, to whom the castle of Norham surrendered. They burned the town of Rippon, layed Beverley under contribution, ravaged the whole North-Riding, and insulted Edward under the walls of the city. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE></P>

<P>The people of the three northern counties were so harrassed and exhausted by those incursions, as well as the palatinate of Durham, that they set on foot a treaty for a truce with the enemy; and it was actually concluded without the king's knowledge. Edward understanding that this affair was transacted with the privity of Andrew de Harcla earl of Carlile, summoned him to court to answer for his conduct; and he disobeying the citation, an order was issued to apprehend him, and the earl of Kent made warden of the Scottish Marches. Harcla by this time had deviated from his allegiance to Edward, either through hatred to the younger D'Espenser, or the ambition of aspiring at an alliance with Robert de Brus, whose sister he demanded in mar∣riage. He had already engaged in a confederacy with that prince, and obliged himself by oath to maintain his title to the throne of Scotland against all per∣sons.

whatever. They agreed likewise to certain conditions of a lasting peace <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be observed by both nations; and as the terms were calculated for their mutual interest, resolved to compel the king to embrace them, should he refuse his voluntary assent. Harcla over-rated his own merit and authority, and was probably intoxicated by the honour he had lately received. He took no pains to conceal this transaction; and the articles of his alliance transpiring, were very well relished by the common people. But, in the midst of all his gay projects, he was taken by his own intimate friend Anthony Lucy, high sheriff of Cum∣berland, and delivered to the king's justices, by whom he was tried for high<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> treason, convicted and condemned to death. He was degraded from his knight∣hood and dignity, and then drawn, hanged, and quartered, at Carlile. The king, by a late treaty with the count of Flanders, had precluded the Scots from any farther assistance from that country; he had resolved to make an∣other expedition into Scotland, during the ensuing summer, and sent for the earl of Ulster, with a strong body of Irish forces, to assist in that undertaking. Nevertheless, he did not reject the overtures of peace, which were made in the name of Brus, by Henry de Sully the French envoy, who had been taken prisoner by the Scots, and released. Conferences were opened at New∣castle between the deputies of both kingdoms; but as Brus insisted upon being acknowledged king of Scotland, and Edward absolutely refused to grant him that title, because in so doing he must have given up his pretensions to the conquest of his father, a treaty of peace seemed altogether impracticable. A truce, however, was effected, to continue from March to Trinity∣sunday, and afterwards prolonged for a fortnight; before the expiration of which, the commissioners agreed to an accommodation, in the form of a truce, for thirteen years. By the articles of this agreement, it was stipulated that a free commerce should be carried on between the two nations; but no other correspondence between the subjects, without a special licence from the conservators of the truce: that no new castles should be erected on the borders, nor old fortresses be repaired; but that the truce should subsist between the two kingdoms, even though the king of England, or the lord Robert de Brus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1323.</NOTE> should die before the term of years should be expired. This agreement was concluded at Thorpe in Yorkshire, by the earl of Pembroke and Hugh D'Espenser the younger, and confirmed with the assent of the king's council; though the lord Beaumont dissented from the other counsellors, and was im∣prisoned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> for his contumacy. Immediately after this agreement, Edward coun∣termanded the forces which he had bespoke from Ireland and Gascony, and laid aside all his other warlike preparations; while Robert de Brus renewed his application to the pope for annulling the sentence of excommunication which had been denounced against him and his kingdom. His people had been so long used to war and depredation, that he found it very difficult to restrain them from infringing the truce by hostilities; and in all probability he repented of having concluded a cessation for such a length of time, during which the martial spirit of his subjects would languish and expire. He therefore resolved to rise in his demands upon England, and gave Edward to understand that the Scots expected the truce should be changed into a formal treaty of perpetual peace, otherwise he could not undertake to prevent their incursions. This insinuation produced conferences at York, in which the Scots demanded an ab∣solute release from all subordination or homage to the crown of England,
<PB N="665" REF="6740"/>
together with the property of all the northern counties as far as York; and the manours of Writtle and Notfield in Essex, which formerly belonged to Ro∣bert de Brus. They likewise proposed a marriage between the daughter of their king and prince Edward; and that these articles should be confirmed before the pope and the French king, by the oaths of English noblemen. These de∣mands were rejected with disdain by the English commissioners; and Brus finding his menaces ineffectual, thought proper to observe the truce, which he could not have infringed with any regard to his reputation.</P>

<P>The war with Scotland, which had produced infinite mischiefs to both kingdoms, was now happily finished, and salutary measures were taken for re-establishing the public tranquillity, by putting the laws in execu∣tion against those robbers and disturbers of the commonwealth, who had been encouraged by the disorders of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the nation was not freed from trouble and disquiet; for tho' the earl of Lancaster was dead, his party still survived; and the subjects in general were exasperated against the two D'Espensers, who by this time engrossed the whole regal au∣thority. An enterprising partizan called Robert Lewen, who had been inured to war and rapine, assembled a number of desperate people and plundered the lands belonging to the earl of Winchester. He made an attempt to seize his person, but the earl took refuge in the castle of Windsor; and the king sent the earl of Kent with a body of troops to his relief. Robert finding himself in no condition to oppose this detachment, retired at their approach; and being pursued from place to place, dismissed his followers, with a view to retire beyond sea with his wife and family. He was discovered at Southampton, apprehended, and brought to his trial: but he refused to answer, and was or∣dered to be pressed; a species of torment which he bore without speaking, un∣til death put an end to his torture. This was not the only attempt against the power of Winchester and his son. The Lancaster faction formed a plan for releasing all their confederates who were imprisoned in different parts of the kingdom, and seizing the castles in which they were confined. The castle of Wallingford was surprized by the friends of Maurice de Berkeley and Hugh de Audeley, who were kept in that fortress; but the town being alarmed be∣fore their associates could be admitted, the place was blocked up by the militia, until the earls of Kent and Winchester arrived with a body of troops to re∣duce it by force. Then the conspirators despairing of being able to defend the castle, set the gates wide open, and fled for sanctuary to the chapel, from which they were violently dragged, and after trial executed as traitors. About this time Roger Mortimer of Wigmore made his escape from the Tower, by the assistance of one Gerard de Alspaye, a domestic of Stephen de Segrave the constable. This man being gained over to his interest, mixed a soporiferous medicine in the drink of the warders, and when they were fast asleep, con∣ducted him to the water-side, where he hired a boat which transported him to the opposite shore. There his servants attended with horses, and he rode di∣rectly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton. Chron. Bian l. M. West.

<P>Edward had scarce quelled the disturbances within his own do∣minions, when he was embroiled in a quarrel with the king of France. Charles le Bel, who succeeded his brother Philip le Long in the throne of that kingdom, had summoned Edward to assist at his coronation, and do homage
<PB N="666" REF="6750"/>
for Guienne and P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nthi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u. He had been amused with various excuses sug∣gested by the D'Espensers, who were averse to a voyage into France, be∣cause conscious to themselves of having incurred the resentment of queen Isa∣bel, who was a princess of that country, and had been insulted by them upon many occasions. At length Charles sent a peremptory citation, fixing a day for Edward's coming to Amiens, and served upon him a monition drawn by a public-notary, as a previous step to the confiscation of Guienne, in case the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> summons should be still disregarded. The king being perplexed in his own mind, had recourse to the advice of parliament, which being called in the be∣ginning of Lent at Westminster, unanimously resolved that he should not go over in person, but send ambassadors to demand further respite of homage. Adam Orleton bishop of Hereford being called to account in this assembly, for sending succours to Roger de Mortimer, and other barons, in the beginning of the late rebellion, refused to answer without leave of the archbishop and the prelates, who interceded in his behalf; and finding the council bent upon bringing him to his trial, carried him out of the court in triumph, threatening all their opposers with excommunication. The bishops of Bath and Lincoln had likewise been concerned in the revolt, and Edward desired the pope to de∣prive them of their sees on that account; but his holiness refused to proceed against them, because treason was not a canonical offence. Edward seeing no hopes of redress from the court of Rome, and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, re∣solved to make use of his own prerogative in the case of Orleton. A jury being impannelled at Hereford, found him guilty of all the crimes laid to his charge; then the king seized his temporalities, and left the church to take cognizance of his person. It was in this parliament that the king prevailed upon the no∣bility<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham Rymer.</NOTE> to agree that the lands of the Templars should be given to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem.</P>

<P>The earl of Kent and the archbishop of Dublin were sent ambas∣sadors to the court of France, where they met with a very honourable recep∣tion; though Charles would not grant the request of Edward, until satisfaction should be made for some injuries he pretended to have sustained in Guienne. He had purchased a spot of ground in the Agenois, and built a town, the in∣habitants of which, though under the jurisdiction of that dutchy, paid no re∣gard to the officers of Edward, confiding in the favour of the French king, to whom appeal lay as lord paramount of the country. Ralph lord Basset of Drayton, seneschal of the dutchy, having for some time bore with their inso∣lence and disobedience, at length marched against them with a body of forces, routed the inhabitants, and destroyed the town. He was summoned before the parliament of Paris to answer for his conduct, and refusing to appear, banished from France for ever. Without regarding this sentence, he took up his quarters in the strong castle of Montpezat, which was likewise the subject of a dispute between the kings of France and England; and expecting to be attacked, prepared for a vigorous defence. Charles insisted upon Ralph's being delivered up to him, together with the castle, as a satisfaction for the damage he had received; and the earl of Kent acquiesced in his demand: but the archbishop refused his assent, until his majesty's pleasure should be known; and while messengers were dispatched to England for that purpose, the earl proceeded to Guienne, to put that country in a posture of defence. Edward refused to deliver up his officers, and Guienne was invaded by a great army under
<PB N="667" REF="6760"/>
the command of Charles count de Valois. All the English in France were seized, with their ships and effects, and a fleet was equipped for a descent upon England. Edward resolved to send over a body of troops for the defence of Guienne, and summoned all persons possessed of forty pounds a year to come and receive the order of knighthood, that he might raise some money towards defraying the expence of this expedition. He retaliated the conduct of Charles, in confiscat∣ing all the ships and effects belonging to the French in England, resumed all the lands, and the whole county of Cornwal, which he had granted to his queen, that she might not have an opportunity to favour the descent of her countrymen, to which the D'Espensers affected to insinuate that she was very well disposed. With great difficulty he equipped a fleet, on board of which he sent a reinforcement of seven thousand men for the defence of Guienne, under the command of the lords Segrave and Fitzwarin; but before they ar∣rived, the count de Valois had subdued the Agenois, and demolished the castle of Montpezat: La Reole surrendered about the latter end of September, and Puimerol and Penne were invested; when a truce was concluded till Easter, and afterwards prolonged to a month after Midsummer in the following year. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Tillet.</NOTE></P>

<P>This disgraceful suspension and capitulation of La Reole were transacted by the earl of Kent, contrary to the sense of all the officers in the army; and are said to have been concluded at the instigation of the archbishop of Dublin, who was a secret enemy of the D'Espensers. Indeed the rupture between the two crowns seems to have been owing to the resentment which Charles conceived against these favourites, for their arrogance and enmity to queen Isabel, from whom they alienated the king's affection, taking every op∣portunity to mortify her pride and thwart her interest. Edward, notwithstand∣ing the truce, continued to levy troops, and make other preparations for main∣taining the war, which he resolved to prosecute in person: he gave public notice of his intention to cross the sea in the beginning of Lent; but by the advice of parliament deferred his voyage till the Ascension; and before that day arrived a treaty of peace was brought upon the carpet. The pope inter∣posed his good offices, employing the archbishop of Vienne, and the bishop of Orange, to mediate an accommodation between the two monarchs: and the bishop of Norwich and Winchester, with the earl of Richmond and lord Beau∣mont, were sent to Paris as deputies to assist at the conferences. Charles started a number of difficulties; but at the same time hinted that all ob∣stacles might be removed by the presence and intercession of his sister queen Isabel. Both the nuncios, and even the English ambassadors, pressed king Edward by letters to send over the queen, who could not fail to bring the dispute to an happy issue: he agreed to the proposal, and Isabel embarked in March for her native country, where she resolved to continue until the two favourites should be discarded. Her husband, however, reaped but little be∣nefit<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. West.</NOTE> from her interposition; for in May a peace was concluded, on conditions<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

It was sti∣pulated that Charles should be put in possession of Guienne, until Edward should have done homage at Beauvais on the twenty-ninth day of August; and then it should be restored to the right owner: that Edward should submit to the decision of the court of peers in France, in the dispute about the lands of Guienne, which were occupied by Charles: that the prisoners on both sides

These apprehensions had such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon his imagination, that when Edward called a council at Winches<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>berate upon this article of the treaty, he could not help exclaiming, <Q>“Whosoever shall advise the king to trust himself among his ene∣mies, is a notorious traitor.”</Q> This declaration deterred the counsellors from giving their opinions on the subject; and for this reason a parliament was con∣voke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at London, where the members unanimously agreed in advising his majesty to comply with that article; as no other expedient occurred, by which the total reduction of Guienne could be prevented. He therefore declared his resolution to cross the sea, and appoint prince Edward regent in his absence. He removed the bishop of Exeter from the post of treasurer, which he be∣stowed upon William de Melton archbishop or York, and set out for Dover, where he purposed to take shipping. Being taken ill at the abbey of Langton, he dispatched messengers to inform the king of France of his indisposition, and desire that another day might be fixed for the homage; and in the mean time letters of protection and safe-conduct were granted by Charles to the nobility and gentry of his retinue. The favourite was not more averse to the king's voyage than the queen herself, who foresaw, that if Edward should come to France, she could not avoid returning with him to England; and by this time her affections were so entirely alienated from her husband, that she could not conceive any misfortune greater than that of living with him as his wife: besides, her resentment against the D'Espensers was implacable; and while they continued in favour, she had no reason to expect either comfort or convenience at the court of England. She had already laid a plan for their destruction, in concert with the English refugees at Paris; and, among others, carried on such an intimacy with Roger Mortimer, as gave rise to reports that were pre∣judicial to her reputation. It was by her suggestion that her brother Charles sent over an instrument to Edward, declaring, that if he would make a con∣veyance of his lands in France to his own son, and send him over to do ho∣mage, he would rest as well satisfied as if it had been done by the father in person. This proposal met with a favourable reception from the D'Espensers, who were glad of any expedient to prevent the king's going abroad. And their advice being seconded by the archbishop of Canterbury, and some prelates that were in attendance, and perhaps favoured the queen's designs, the king made a formal conveyance of Ponthieu and Guienne to his son Edward, who embarked at Dover, under the tuition of the bishop of Exeter, with a large<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, in the whole course of his reign, had never taken such an imprudent step as this, of parting with the heir apparent of his crown. Young Edward was so caressed by his mother, that she gained a total ascendency over his affections: she interested him in her quarrel, and he refused to return when
<PB N="669" REF="6780"/>
his father sent for him to England. The queen declared she would never re∣visit the island until Hugh D'Espenser should be banished the kingdom with disgrace. The revenues of the countries conveyed to her son, not only sup∣plied her with the means of subsisting, but even enabled her, with the con∣junction of young Edward, to take measures for an invasion of England, which she boasted of having planned in concert with the Lancastrian faction, who were ready to take arms in her favour. Her behaviour on this occasion was the more surprising to Edward, as she had parted seemingly in friendship with the favourite, and even writ kind letters to him since her arrival in France. The king sollicited her in the most earnest manner to come home, and promised that her happiness should be consulted in every respect. He intreated the king of France to insist upon her leaving his dominions, and commanded his son to return upon his duty and allegiance. These intreaties proving ineffectual, he summoned a parliament to meet at Westminster, and assist him with their advice in this perplexing situation; there it was resolved that all the bishops should write separately to the queen, exhorting her to return to her husband, and remove the occasion of scandal, which she had given by her fa∣miliarity with Mortimer, and connexions with the fugitive rebels, who had endeavoured to subvert the constitution. Edward himself renewed his impor∣tunities and expostulation with her and her brother Charles, and ordered the bishop of Exeter to bring back the prince with all convenient expedition. Isabel pretended that her life was in danger from the machinations of D'Espenser; Charles observed that decency and natural affection would not permit him to drive his sister out of his dominions; and young Edward refused to leave his mother in her affliction. The bishop of Exeter pressed his pupil to return; and, from his attachment to the king, was so odious to Isabel and her favourite Mortimer, who could not conceal their correspondence from his notice, that they resolved to frighten him out of the kingdom of France. For that pur∣pose a sham conspiracy was formed against his life. They took care that he should be apprized of the pretended design, which the honest prelate no sooner understood, than he retreated with equal secrecy and dispatch to England, where he made the king acquainted with the cabals and hostile intention of Isabel and the English refugees. Edward thinking it was high time to pre∣pare for this impending storm, issued orders for searching all passengers at the sea-ports, as well as for examining suspected persons all over the kingdom. The wardens of the Cinque-Ports and the admirals were directed to receive the queen and prince with due honour, should they come over in the vessels which the king had provided for their passage; but to treat all their adherents as ene∣mies of the kingdom, should they attempt to make a descent in a hostile man∣ner. Proclamations were sent into every county, ordering all persons to be ready to march against foreigners wherever they should land in the kingdom: they were enjoined to apprehend the emissaries of the queen's faction, and to put in execution the statute of Edward I. against such as spread false reports, tending to create discord between the king and the people. The king wrote a letter to the pope, desiring his holiness would not grant a dispensation for the marriage of his son Edward without his consent, but exert his influence in persuading the king of France to send the queen and prince of England out of his dominions; and lastly, he employed Arnaud Caillon, a Gascon nobleman, to treat in his name with the nobility of that province, that the queen should receive no succours from Guienne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad.

<P>While Edward was busied in taking these necessary precautions, reports were industriously circulated to his prejudice, on the continent. He was said to have denounced a sentence of banishment against the queen and prince; and it was afterwards rumoured in France, that he had caused all the subjects of that crown, who were in England, to be seized and put to death. Considering that his own son was at that time in the French court, and such a number of his trading people in that kingdom, Charles could not possibly give credit to such an improbable aspersion: yet, on this pretence, he ordered all the English subjects in France to be apprehended, to the number of three∣score thousand, confiscated their effects, and renewed hostilities in Guienne. Perhaps the report was spread by his own emissaries, that he might have a handle for invading Guienne and dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing the king of England; so as that he might be the less able to oppose the descent which his sister had projected. Edward being informed of these acts of violence, ordered his military tenants to rendezvous at Portchester, in order to embark for Guienne; and in the mean time seized all the French subjects who were in England, together with their ships and effects. This expedition, however, did not take effect, because the king found it necessary to employ all his power in the defence of England, which the queen threatened to invade. The pope resenting this behaviour of Charles, who had infringed the peace which he had mediated, and scandalized at the familiarity which openly subsisted between his sister Isabel and Mortimer, under the countenance of the French court, exhorted Charles to send his sister and her son back to England; and even threatened him with excommunication, should he persist in detaining them, contrary to all the rules of decency and good faith.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>This declaration had such effect upon Charles and his council, that they would no longer openly countenance Isabel and her paramour. It was even debated among the peers, whether or not they should cause her and her son to be apprehended and conveyed to king Edward; and her brother sent her a copy of the pope's letter, with an order to leave his dominions without delay. Notwithstanding this affectation of candour, and obedience to his ho∣liness, he certainly employed his interest clandestinely in her behalf; and it was at the desire of Charles that Robert d'Artois treated with William count of Hainault and Holland, for his assistance to Isabel queen of England. That prince's dominions lay very convenient for an embarkation; and his concurrence was secured by a contract of marriage between young Edward and one of his daughters. The articles of this alliance being settled, Isabel and the prince set out from Paris for Ponthieu; from whence she repaired to Valenciennes, where she was very cordially received by count William and his brother John, who dedicated his life to her service, and afterwards accompanied her to England; and as Edward, who was then just turned of fourteen, seemed captivated by the count's second daughter Philippa, the young couple were affianced, though the nuptials were not consummated. A body of forces being assembled, and a fleet of transports equipped, the queen and her son embarked at Dordrecht, accompanied by the earl of Kent, who had by this time declared in her favour; Roger de Mortimer, with some of the lords of her faction; and John de Beaumont, brother to count William, at the head of three thousand men<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ingham.</NOTE> at arms, besides a good number of infantry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and after a dangerous passage ar∣rived at Orewell, near Walton in Suffolk, about the latter end of September<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

The earl of Kent was not only first cousin to the queen, by his mother Margaret of France, but he had lately married the sister of Thomas lord Wake, who had been a staunch adherent of Lancaster. Kent's brother, Thomas earl of Norfork and Mareschal, espoused the same cause for the same reason; and John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, who had been employed to negotiate the peace at the court of France, was debauched from his allegiance by the artifices of Charles and the caresses of Isabel. This was likewise the case with Henry lord Beau∣mont, who owed his whole fortune to the bounty of the king and his father. The first refused to return, and his lands were seized; the other came back, in order to promote the queen's interest in England; but his proceedings being discovered, he was arrested and imprisoned in the castle of Wallingford. All<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> those who had formerly joined in the faction of Lancaster, were now ready to embark in the queen's undertaking; and all the relations of those who had been put to death and forfeited for that rebellion, were eager to seize this op∣portunity of retrieving the honours and estates which their families had lost. The archbishop of Canterbury and the majority of the prelates were in her in∣terest, as well as every individual who hated the younger D'Espenser, whose insolence, cruelty, and avarice, had incensed the whole nation. All the great earls abandoned Edward, except those of Surrey and Arundel; the first of whom was now in the north, guarding the Scottish Marches: the king himself was weak, indolent, and timorous, dispirited by this defection of his nobles, and disre∣garded not only by his subjects in general, but even by his own officers and servants, who neglected his orders, and allowed the queen to land without molestation. She was immediately joined by the earl of Norfolk, and the bishops of Norwich, Ely, and Lincoln, with their followers; and at the same time she received a sum of money from the metropolitan for the payment of her army. The earl of Lei∣cester, brother of the late earl of Lancaster, and other noblemen of his party, as∣sembled their vassals, and repaired to her standard with a very strong reinforce∣ment. The presence and concurrence of the prince was worth a whole army to the queen, because it removed the terror of forfeitures, and afforded on op∣portunity for enterprising people to recommend themselves to his future favour, when he should ascend the throne. When the king heard of Isabel's landing, he issued a proclamation, offering a reward of one thousand pounds for Morti∣mer's head; and ordered his liege subjects to fall upon and destroy the foreign∣ers by whom that traitor was attended. He granted commissions to array men in Kent, and all the counties in England; and Robert de Wateville was em∣powered to raise all the forces of Essex, and that country which constituted the old kingdom of the East Angles. But he betrayed his trust, and joining the prince with the troops he could assemble, became one of the queen's most active partisans. Isabel exerted herself with great industry in writing circular letters to the noblemen and cities of the kingdom, and publishing manifestos, in which she declared that no injury should be offered to any person but the D'Espensers, the chancellor Baldock, and their abettors, who were the source of the present disturbances; that she was come to ease the people of their burdens, assert the liberties of the church, and reform the administration. The bishops employed their whole influence in the support of her cause; they magnified the number of the forces, and the quality of the persons sent over by the king of France to defend the rights of his sister. A report was in∣dustriously spread over all the kingdom, that the pope had absolved the subjects

<P>When he received the first intelligence of the queen's arrival, he demanded a supply of men from the city of London; but the magistrates evaded his proposal by a general profession of loyalty, and giving him to un∣derstand, that they should act contrary to their privileges, in serving without the walls of the city, except for a single day, so as that they might return by sun-set. Edward concluding from this dry, ambiguous answer, that he had nothing to expect from that quarter, and that his person was not safe among people who had never been well affected to his family, retired to Bristol, in hope of finding more zeal and attachment among the inhabitants of that city and neighbourhood. He left his younger son, and his niece, the wife of the younger D'Espenser, in the Tower, under the care of Walter Stapledon bishop of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xeter, who, together with those of London and Winchester, had published at St. Paul's the pope's bull of excommunication against all who invaded the realm, or disturbed the peace of the nation. Immediately after the king's de∣parture from London, the populace ran to arms, seized the mayor, who was attached to Edward, and compelled him to authorise their proceedings; then they bound themselves by an association to kill and destroy all persons, without distinction of rank and circumstance, who should oppose the queen, or intrench upon the liberties of the city. Having formed this confederacy, they appre∣hended John Marshal, who enjoyed an office under D'Espenser, put him to death, and plundered his effects. Then they pillaged the house of the bishop of Exeter, who at that time was just returning from his seat in the country. Being informed of the tumult, he proceeded towards St. Paul's, in hope of reaching the Tower, but was seized by the way, dragged violently from his horse, and conveyed to the great cross in Cheapside, where the furious mob severed his head from his body. His nephew, with one of his attendants, un∣derwent the same fate; their bodies were denied christian burial; and the rioters sent the bishop's head in a present to the queen. Next day, they surprized John de Weston, governor of the Tower, released all the prisoners, dismissed<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. West. Cont. Ang.

<P>During these transactions, the queen had marched to Wallingford, and detached the earl of Kent and John de Hainault, with the flower of her troops, in pursuit of the king, who was obliged to take shipping at Bristol for Wales, where he thought he should be able to raise a body of his countrymen. Hugh D'Espenser earl of Winchester was left with some troops to defend the town and castle of Bristol; but his garrison being disaffected, he was obliged in three days to surrender at discretion. Isabel, who had been joined at Glou∣cester by the lords Piercy and Wake, and other noblemen of the Welsh Marches, no sooner heard of Winchester's being taken, than she marched to Bristol, in order to determine the fate of that nobleman, who was by this time turned of ninety. He was brought before Sir William Trussel, whom she ap∣pointed chief justice on this occasion; and he, in presence of the earls of Nor∣folk, Kent, and Leicester, Roger de Mortimer, the lord Wake, and others, charged Hugh D'Espenser with introducing a custom of condemning people
<PB N="673" REF="6820"/>
without trial, widening the breach between the king and his barons, and advising his majesty to put the late earl of Lancaster to death without cause assigned or form of process. He was for these crimes condemned to die the death of a traitor; and the sentence was executed with great barbarity. He was hanged upon the common gallows, his body cut in pieces and given to the dogs for food, and his head exposed at Winchester. On the queen's arrival at Bristol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>singham. M. W. Cont. Leland.</NOTE> Edward was summoned by a proclamation to return and re-assume the reins of government, if he would conform to the advice of his barons. And as he did not appear, the prince was declared guardian and regent of the kingdom during his father's absence; the prelates and noblemen of his party took the oath of allegiance to him in that capacity; he appointed the bishop of Norwich chan∣cellor, and the bishop of Winton treasurer, and took the administration into his own hands.</P>

<P>Mean while the unhappy king, accompanied by the younger D'Espenser, repaired to C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rfilly in Glamorganshire, where he summoned his military tenants in South Wales to rise in his defence. This order producing no effect, he embarked for Ireland; but, after having been tempest-beaten a whole week by contrary winds, he was obliged to land privately at Swansey, and took refuge in the monastery of Neath. From thence he sent his own nephew Edward de Bohun, fourth son of the late earl of Hereford, Rese ap Griffith, and two other commissioners, to treat with the queen and prince Ed∣ward. At this juncture he had very little to expect from a negotiation of that nature. The queen advanced with her army to Hereford, from whence she detached the earl of Leicester, with some Welsh noblemen, and a body of marchers, to discover the place of Edward's retreat. This task they performed by bribing the natives, who betrayed him to his enemies: he was taken in November, with the earl of Arundel, Robert de'Baldock, and Simon de Reding, in the castle of Lantressan; and Hugh D'Espenser was apprehended in a neigh∣bouring wood. Edward was removed to Lidbury, and afterwards to the castle of Kenilworth, where he remained all the winter, in the custody of the earl of Leicester, who had by this time assumed the title of Lancaster. Bal∣dock, Reding, and D'Espenser, were carried to Hereford, where John, Daniel, and Thomas de Muchedeure, had already been beheaded as friends to the king, who was now compelled to deliver up the great seal to his son, as guardian of the realm. Hugh D'Espenser was arraigned before the same judges who con∣demned his father, and underwent the same fate with uncommon fortitude. His head was sent to London, where the citizens received it with brutal triumph, and fixed it on the bridge: but his eldest son Hugh, about nineteen years of age, defended himself so gallantly in the castle of Caerfilly, that he obtained an honourable capitulation, by which he and the garrison were secured in their persons and effects. Arundel was beheaded, Robert de Baldock, the king's chancellor and canon of St. Paul's, was claimed as an ecclesiastic by the bishop of Hereford, who conveyed him to his own house, near Old Fish-street-hill in London, from whence he was dragged by the bailiffs and populace, and lodged in Newgate, where he died in great misery. The multitude was by this time become bloody and desperate. They plundered the treasure belong∣ing to the chancellor, the earl of Arundel, and a company of merchants called the Bardi, who acted as bankers to Hugh D'Espenser: Anthony D'Espagne, an opulent merchant, concerned in farming the duty upon wine, was dragged
<PB N="674" REF="6830"/>
barefoot to a place called Nomensland, where he was beheaded by the licentious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opulace. The houses of John lord Charleton, Sir William Cliff, and many others, were pillaged; the ecclesiastical courts were all shut up, the mayor and sheriffs durst not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old their hustings or hear causes; the execution of justice was totally ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tructed: while anarchy, rapine, and murder, prevailed not only<NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Ch. 1327.</NOTE> in London, but likewise in all the great cities of the kingdom. The prince, as guardian of the kingdom, having convoked a parliament at Westminster in the king's name, the members assembled according to the writs, on the seventh day of January. The house was surrounded by the mob of London, clamouring against the king and his adherents; and the bishop of Hereford having declared aloud, that the queen could not cohabit again with Edward, without running the most imminent danger of her life, put the question to the parliament, whether they would be governed by the father or the son. The members were desired to consider the alternative, so as to give their answer next day in the afternoon, to which the parliament was adjourned. When they met at the appointed time, the few friends of the king were so intimidated by the tumults without doors, and the power of the faction within, that they durst not deliver their sentiments; and the same question being repeated, it was resolved that young Edward should be elevated to the throne. The lords did homage to him in consequence of this resolution: then he was led out into Westminster∣hall, and presented to the populace as their king: the archbishop of Canter∣bury harangued the multitude on the maxim which faith, That the voice of the people is the voice of God; and the bishops of Winton and Hereford held forth to the same purpose. Silence being commanded, the prince was pro∣claimed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cr.</NOTE> king, and hymns were sung to celebrate his inauguration. Some of the bishops, however, scrupled to take the oath of allegiance; and were forcibly con∣veyed by the populace to Guildhall, where they thought proper to comply, and even swear to defend and maintain the rights and privileges of the city of London. But as young Edward's authority could not be established while his father con∣tinued unimpeached, the queen and Mortimer resolved to proceed to a formal deposition of that unfortunate monarch. Writs were issued for returning eight and forty members from North and South Wales, as the representatives of that principality; and this addition of Mortimer's creatures being made to the par∣liament, the bishop of Winchester drew up six articles of impeachment against the king, importing that he wanted capacity to govern the realm, inasmuch as he had been during the whole course of his reign misled by evil counsellors, to his own dishonour, and the prejudice of the church and people, without giving ear to the advice of the greatest and wisest men of the kingdom: that he employed his time in pursuits unworthy of his character, and neglected the affairs of the administration: that by his misconduct he lost the kingdom of Scotland, together with lands and territories in Gascony and Ireland: that he distressed the holy church, by prosecuting and imprisoning churchmen: and that he caused many noblemen of the land to be imprisoned, banished, dis∣herited, and put to ignominious death: that, instigated by evil counsel and his own avarice, he had broke his coronation-oath: that he abandoned his people; and did as much as in him lay to ruin the kingdom: and that these truths being notorious, he was altogether incorrigible, and therefore ought to be de∣posed. These articles being read in presence of the prince, seated on the throne, it was resolved that young Edward should assume the regal power; and that
<PB N="675" REF="6840"/>

<P>When this vote passed, the queen acted an unworthy farce, in affecting to weep and wail, and even to swoon at the news of her husband's deposition; and young Edward was tutored to declare, that he would not as∣sume the royal authority without his father's consent. On pretence of obviating this objection, as well as to give a kind of sanction to their irregular proceedings, the parliament deputed three bishops, two earls, the same number of barons, abbots, and justices, with some representatives of counties and boroughs, to go and notify their resolution to the king at Kenilworth. The three prelates visited him before the rest, and after warm professions of regard and attach∣ment, exhorted him to make a voluntary resignation of the crown: they assured him of the most honourable treatment, in case he would resign, and gave him to understand that his refusal would be attended with the worst consequences to his family; for in that case the parliament were resolved to set the crown on the head of a stranger. The weak and irresolute Edward suffered himself to be persuaded by their remonstrance, and complied with the proposal; yet when the deputies entered his apartment, he was so much affected with his own dis∣grace, that he would have dropped down in a swoon had not he been sup∣ported by his attendants. He soon recollected his spirits, however; and pro∣fessed himself deeply afflicted with the reflection of what his people had suf∣fered by his misconduct, for which he asked pardon of all present; but seeing what was past could not be recalled, he said all he could do was to thank them for suffering his crown to descend upon the head of his eldest son. Then he formally surrendered the regalia, which had been brought thith<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for that pur∣pose; and William Trufsel, who acted as procurator for the parliament, did, in their name, renounce the homage and fealty they had sworn to Edward, de∣claring that they would not hold any thing of him as king, nor pay him any further allegiance. The deputies having made a report of this transaction at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE> their return to parliament, the queen pretended to be consoled, and the prince con∣sented to his own elevation. The new king's peace and accession were proclaimed according to custom, through all England: he was knighted by John de Hainault, and crowned on Sunday the first of February, in Westminster-abbey, by Wal∣ter archbishop of Canterbury, in presence of seven bishops, and almost all the nobility of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Immediately after the coronation a petition was presented to par∣liament, in behalf of all who had been concerned in the rebellion of Lan∣caster, praying that all sentences of banishment, outlawry, fines, ransoms, or penalties, denounced against them, should be repealed, and that they should be restored to their forfeited estates. Their prayer was immediately granted, together with a general amnesty for all offences committed by the queen's ad∣herents, to the day of the coronation. The queen and Mortimer, not satisfied with having deprived Edward of his royalty, are said to have contrived a scheme for taking away his life. They perceived that a great number of those who joined them in their vengeance against the two D'Espensers, had no sus∣picion of their design to depose the king, and consequently were dissatisfied at that measure. They dreaded the compassion of the English, which never fails to glow even in favour of an enemy in distress: they foresaw a returning tide of affection towards the unfortunate son of their ever-glorious Edward<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and
<PB N="676" REF="6850"/>
they suspected the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>osition of Lancaster, who treated his royal prisoner with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> They therefore removed him from Kenilworth to Berkeley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where he was committed to the care of Sir John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by whom he was alternately guarded.

His persecuters had hoped that confinement, and the violence of his grief and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would have put a period to his life, as his disposition was fickle and impatient: but, while he continued under the care of the earl of Lancaster, he began to be reconciled to his situation, and amused himself in composing elegies upon his misfortunes. But this resignation, by which his health was confirmed, tending to disappoint the views of his enemies, the new keepers were instructed to harrass him with insults and ill usage. The miscreants exe∣cuted this order with the most diabolical inventions and perseverance. They contrived horrid noises to prevent or interrupt his natural repose: they com∣pelled him to eat of the most unsavoury and disagreeable food: he was lodged in a cold, damp tower of Berkeley-castle, exposed not only to the inclemencies of the weather, but also to the intolerable stench of putrid carcasses, piled upon the roof of his chamber with a view to annoy his sense of smelling: the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erable apartment in which he lay was generally overflowed with rain-wa∣ter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he was subjected to the most provoking insults by servants and scul∣hons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who were encouraged to treat him in that unworthy manner. All these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stances of torture and chagrin are said to have been devised by the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hop of Hereford, who finding this method of proceeding less effectual than he had expected, and dreading the consequences that might ensue, should it be reported to young Edward, resolved to anticipate such a discovery by the immediate murder of the old king; for which he contrived an expedient that was executed by his two keepers on the twenty-first day of September. About mid-night they entered his chamber, while he lay asleep, and ordering the ruffians <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o attended them to hold him fast down to the bed, are said to have thrust a re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-hot iron up his body, by such a conveyance as prevented any external marks of violence.

resembled his father in the accomplishments of his person, as well as in his countenance: but in other respects he seems to have inherited only the defects of his character; for he was cruel and illiberal, without his valour or capacity. He had levity, indolence, and irresolution, in common with other weak princes; but the distinguishing foible of his character, was that unaccountable passion for the reigning favourite, to which he sacrificed every other consideration of policy and convenience, and at last fell a miserable victim. Yet his bitterest enemies never alledged that any thing unnatural entered into the composition of that singular attachment which he expressed for Gaveston and the younger D'Espenser <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edward II. by Isabel of France, had two sons, and as many daughters; namely, Edward, who succeeded him on the throne; John, who died at Perth; Jane, married to David Brus king of Scotland; and Eleanor, who espoused Reginald duke of Gueldres.
