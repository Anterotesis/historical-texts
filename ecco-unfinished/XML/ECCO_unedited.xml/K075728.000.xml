<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now, noble Captain Killmallock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder if the ingenious gentleman, that first hit upon digging, tried it with as pleasant a broiling sun over his head, as we have—By my soul, if he went to work with his jacket on, it would have warmed it pretty decently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are slaves, Kilmallock, and must submit, but we are soldiers of Spain, christian soldiers, both our faith and our profession, when providence inflicts calamity preach pati∣ence to us, murmurs are fruitless brother soldier, the sickle goddess, Fortune, hears not the complaining of the grief worn captive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, now, Count Virolet I always understood the good lady was blind, but I was never before told she was dunny, faith and that I take to be the reason she has never been good natured enough to listen—when I have reminded her what a dirty devil she has been to me, first I was tosted out of Tippera∣ry into Spain, where I have fought these seven years under Ferdinand, the fifth King of Castile, and Arragon, till the thumps bestowed on me by his Catholic majesty's enemies, (and be hanged to them) have b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laboured up to the rank of a captai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>Right, of Calatrava, of which gallant order I boast mys<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf a member.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and you may boast, for my part I never had the knack of it—but I have had the honor, signior of fighting side by s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, with you; against the Moors of Grenada, there.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And bravely too, good comrade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alli!—one for that, well now I have the honour of being locked up with you, in the gardens of an old whisker faced Arabian, we have been prisoners these three months, and here are a pretty pair of famous knights, that boast themselves of the gallant Order of Calatrava, with a bit of a shovel popt into their noble hands, digging away like two planters of potatoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet comfort thee Killmallock, Grenada is closely be∣sieged, our royal master Ferdinand, has raised, and fortified a
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
town near to their walls, 'tis as I hear, a well stock'd hive of war, terming with close compacted swarms of soldiery, who will so buz about their Moorships ears; yea, and so sting these streak skinned muss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmen, that they will smart to death with it. Noble comrade, prove but their arms successful, and 'twill cut aroad to freedom for us. Yet that's doubtful, there were in∣deed a shorter way.</P>
<STAGE>(musing.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then let's be after trudging, that if there are two roads out of captivity, I am always for travelling the shortest cut, because it bids fair to be the nearest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, I will trust thee, I do know thee brave, and in the breast, where fire-ey'd courage rears her rugged throne, sure honor must inhabit! yet dare I trust thee?</P>
<STAGE>(considering)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dare you! look'ye Count Virolet, you dare do much, for you are the first that ever dare tell me to my teeth, he held my honour in doubt—Oh! fire and ounds, and saint Dominick to boot. Hark'ye, Sir Don, I was never a hunter after other men's secrets, as I am not over fond of keeping what does not belong to me, but I am an Irishman, mark you me, born a sub∣ject to his English majesty, heaven prosper the king, and country to the end of time, and if any Spaniard, Frenchman, or else∣where touch upon our honors, by my soul, we'll fillip 'em sound∣dly for daring to call it in question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, were the merits of thy nation scann'd from one particular, and thou the sample, I should affirm thy coun¦trymen all heart, stuff'd with such manly qualities, that it doth grievously perplex their heads, when to find sit seasons for exerci∣sing them. He that doth take offence before 'tis meant, isin him∣self oss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding, Sir, it dwelt not within my thoughts to anger you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you did not give me a shake of your Spanish fist, signior. I intreat your pardon. Bestrew me count, but I am as far from giving an offence wrongsully, as I am from taking one, and as I am the sample you talk of, mark down this for my, countrymen, if it please you, if my head mischances to run itself in the dark against the seelings of another, my heart bids me go thro' fire and water, for his service, by way of reparation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The spirit of thy warm and kindly nation, shines thro' thy speech, rough soldier, hear me comrade! thou knowest the governor.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your patience, this same Moor who holds us captives, has one fair daughter, beauties parragon; each evening as the sun begins to sink, behind the mountains top, in yonder tower
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
she sits, and in a simple mournful ditty, pours forth a strain of native melody, that doth enchant the ravished hearers soul, out warbling Philomel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And certainly an afternoon's song is a mighty pretty refreshment, for a jontleman who has been turning up the mould for eight hours together, But for the life of me now, I can∣not think how it will give him strength to squeeze thr'o the for∣tifications of Grenada.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Och! the crater.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft to her window have I stole at dusk, when from the tower a silken cord has dropt, and thus in mute exchange, we have convey'd our written vows, for speech were dangerous. Her Fa∣ther, chief about the Moorish king, holds the town keys in charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The keys!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye comrade, our project ripens, she has will'd me to bring a chosen friend to back my enterprize, and thou art he whom I select, Kilmallock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Count Virolet, and you have chosen as handsomly as heart can desire, for the service of a fair lady, or a small mat∣ter of fighting, you may search the world over before you will find any better prepared than an Irishman.</P>
