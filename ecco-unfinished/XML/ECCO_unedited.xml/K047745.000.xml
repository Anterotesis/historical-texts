<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> <HI>Archibald Mac Donald</HI> of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verlocky,</HI> being pos∣sest of the sublime Il∣lumination, heredita∣ry from many Ance∣stors, the bright Ray of Secret Knowledge, conveying to me a true Intelligence in things hidden from mortal View; that superiour Gift, by which a more intense Sight of things to come is communicated, and whereby, in sacred Raptures, such Vi∣sion
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
is convey'd as is not only incom∣municable, but inexpressible from one Man to another; also, I say, being possest of this secret Impression of Know∣ledge, and excited thereby to search into the Mysteries of things unknown; I am likewise animated thereby, to in∣struct Mankind, warn, and forewarn them in things to come: In order whereunto, addressing my Words with Affection and deep Concern, to all the Enquirers after Knowledge, to whose Souls Wisdom is as Light is to the Eye, <HI>viz.</HI> Solace and Delight, and to whom Ignorance is as Darkness and Death. Be it known therefore to the Sons of Men, That albeit, by the Ap∣pointment and Permission of Heaven, hidden and secret things, otherwise impenetrable in Nature, are compassed and understood by Science, Application of the Mind, intense Reasoning, and just Pursuit of Knowledge; yet that Futurity, the dark reserved Decrees directing and ordering the Revolutions of Times, the Periods and Conjuncti∣on of Accidents, determined by the Prescience of Nature, and fore-appoint∣ed to come to pass; these are only known to those to whom this sublime
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Power of <HI>Vision</HI> is granted, as a Gift from on High.</P>
<P>The Gift, by Men called the SE∣COND SIGHT, is an unconfin'd, celestial Ray of Light, empowering Nature, though none knoweth by what Means, to discern of things to come, frequently operating not only on Persons terrene, and things sublunary and mortal, but sometimes extended to things celestial and supernatural, and even to view the Face of the Hea∣vens, the Signs celestial, the elemen∣tary Motions and Revolutions of those other Worlds the Planets; and in them to see, not the several extraordinary Influences only, which they have on things below, known in Part, though dimly, to some by <HI>Astrological</HI> Experi∣ments; but also those portentous Sig∣nifications which they are stor'd with, which the wise Men, <HI>Magicians</HI> and <HI>Astrologers,</HI> &amp;c. laugh at, and endeavour to esteem vain, because they are not able to fathome or discern them; but to those to whom this bright Ray of <HI>Visionsry</HI> Knowledge is convey'd, are undoubted and effectually discovered.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Led by this Ray of supernatural Light it was, that, at Midnight the <HI>first</HI> Day of the Month of <HI>January,</HI> rising from my Bed of Feathers, soft and refreshing to me as Pillows of Down, and standing on the highest Pinnacle of the Mountain <HI>Aphlec,</HI> in one of the floating Islands of the mi∣raculous <HI>Lough-loman,</HI> I was mov'd to regard the Aspect of celestial Nature.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dancers,</HI> those <HI>Igni fatui</HI> of the <HI>Northern</HI> Regions, those Lights sound in the Abyss of Darkness, shone bright∣ly with their dazling and unsteady Rays, leaving Nature it self, and all the wise Discoverers of her most secret Parts, at a Loss, and in the Dark, to know from whence they proceed. The Stars shone portentous, and with Aspect malignant, boding Evil to the doz'd World, gave Notice to me, that I might suddenly expect an extraordi∣nary Vision of things to come; I had repeated Warnings from secret Fore∣knowledge, that something dreadful attended.</P>
<P>Expecting, with some Affliction, what should offer to an extended Sight, there appeared a vast globular, but dark Body, passing swiftly in a cir∣cular
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Motion; no Appearance at first offering to my Sight, of its being so much as capable of a reflex Light, till passing by me in a parallel Position, I discern'd it to be the Body of the Moon, some time after its Conjunction with the Sun, called by Men the <HI>Change.</HI> I was confirm'd in this being but <HI>Visionary,</HI> because, by the natural Motion of that Planet, I knew she must really be, at that Time, out of my or∣dinary Sight; and likewise the Sun, its ancient Illuminator, being then in the opposite Hemisphere: The Appearance passed on, took a remote and undis∣cernable Motion till the Dawn, when the approaching Light causing it to disappear, I received Notice, that I should, at a certain Distance of Time, see the most effectual and central Con∣junction that had been visible to these Parts of the World, for 800 Years past.</P>
<P>By this I found, even as directly as <HI>Astronomers,</HI> by their calculated Tables and Numbers, that the Moon, which was the dark Body so represented, was, by her natural Course, to pass in such a Position at her usual Time in the <HI>Fourth</HI># Change inclusive from that
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Hour, and which should be in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> that it should, for a∣bove two Hours, effectually and totally eclypse and intercept the celestial Rays of the Sun from this <HI>Island,</HI> especially from its <HI>Southern</HI> Parts, and from a great Part of this Hemisphere.</P>
<P>The Illumination discovers to the rarified and exalted Sight, innumerable malignant Influences, which this Con∣junction is armed with, Na∣ture <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> concurring; nor is the portentous Vision any In∣terruption to the Necessity, by which Nature brings to pass the Conjunction of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> any more than the said Conjunction, being natural, forbids that it should also be directed to pre∣dict Terrors to the World, and parti∣cularly to this or that, or any Part thereof.</P>
<P>Alarmed by this Intimation, and moved to watch the great Discovery which, by Vision, I expected near my View, I observed the Sun withdrawing its benign Rays from the World, and suffering its Fires to expend infinite E∣manation of stagnated Vapours, insecti∣ous and suffocating, envigorating the
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
Atmosphore of this Earth, and perhaps of all the other Planetary Worlds, with poysonous Atoms, commissioned by Heaven to cast their Darts, as they shall be immediately directed.</P>
<P>Hence Plagues, Chronical Distem∣pers, and Contageous Diseases upon Man and Beast, such as have not been felt; Inundations of Water, Tempests of Wind, subterraneous Irruptions of Air, scorching Drought, and all the armed Terrors of Nature, stand obe∣dient to the heavenly Direction; and though produced by natural Causes, are nevertheless martialled in such Or∣der, and under such Directions, as the Great Maker of Nature has determin∣ed, or shall determine and direct.</P>
<P>Nor does their being the Product of Nature, in a Manner and Method which Learned Philosophers can ac∣count for, lessen the Reason or Verity of this, that all these extraordinary Motions and Conjunctions of the hea∣venly Bodies have such Influences, ordinary and extraordinary, on the sublunary World, as their Governour pleases to direct; which as it is rea∣sonable to Men to believe, so to those who have this Gift of supernatural
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
Vision, these Influences and Operations, and sometimes the Manner thereof, are more visible than Demonstration it self.</P>
<P>Turning my self then towards the splendid Dawn, I seem'd to disco∣ver <HI>War</HI> with his armed Thousands, riding suriously over the World, and following close in the Heels of the dark Body aforesaid, of the Moon: He sat mounted upon the Sign <HI>Taurus,</HI> or the <HI>Bull,</HI> in which Zodiack Division this Conjunction of the Sun and Moon shall appear. Thus he appears attending, till the fatal Time, when the said Planets meet, and the Moon should in such a Position, as should intersect the Glorious Rays of the Center of Light. Here <HI>War</HI> advances, as if, at this Time, summon'd to receive his Commission to enflame the World, raise Commoti∣ons, stir up the Pride, Passions, and Vices of Mankind, into such Fermen∣tations, as should issue in general De∣structions.</P>
<P>He was follow'd by <HI>Death,</HI> a dismal Statue in Shape humane, but erect and tall as to Heaven, floating triumphant on a dark Chariot in a vast Lake of stag∣nate Blood, into which emptied them∣selves
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
Seven Rivers of Blood, flowing from Seven several and distant Parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Pestilence</HI> and <HI>Famine</HI> waited at a Distance, attended with an innumera∣ble Crowd, who all came, and stood ready to pay their Homage at the dreadful Lake, to the dismal Statue of Death, Clouds and Darkness closing up the Rear.</P>
<P>While this Appearance, in a terri∣ble manner affrighting, agitated my Imagination, the Sun rise in the East∣ern part of the Hemisphere, and shin∣ing bright and glorious, proceeded on his Course till he almost touch'd the South-East Point, when the dark Opa∣cous Globe aforesaid of the Moon in∣visible till then began to intersect his Rayes, progressively restoring Night in the Bloom of Day, discovering the Stars of the other Hemisphere, not seen by our Eyes at any time before.</P>
<P>In the Centre of this Circumstance, it clearly appears to the dilated Sight how the several Parts of the Earth stood influenced, and are subjected to the fatal Hands of those terrible Evils, which received their Commission from above, to direct their Malignity to
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
those Parts of the World to which this Interruption of the heavenly Light was most central.</P>
<P>And although the receiving their Commission as aforesaid, the manner of the Vision, and the Orders given to the Plagues, Terrors, and dreadful Evils which threaten the World, are not possible to be related, and are re∣presented here as imaginary only; yet something of what this sublime Vision may have been capable of Understand∣ing, as to subsequent Events in the World, may be understood in the fol∣lowing Order.</P>
<P>Elevated in the Place where I stood, as well as lifted up in Soul by the Pow∣er of this secret Illumination, I beheld appearing to the extended Sight dim Rayes of reflex Light streaming conta∣geous Fire from the Verges of the Eclyps∣ed Sun, and darting upon sundry Parts of the Earth, discovering again in those Parts the People who are immediately influenced by the portentous effectual Particles of Flame flashing upon them; in some Parts this moves one way, in some another, and respectively here or there, to raising Commotions, forming black and hellish Designs, laying the
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
Foundations of Treason, Conspiracy, ambitious Struggles of Great Men one against another; from thence extend∣ing to Princes, Kings, Empires, and Nations; making fatal Breaches in their own Tranquillity, at which dread∣ful Chasms naturally enter War, Con∣fusion, Plagues, and all kinds of Cala∣mity, till from those Countries again in streaming Rivers the Blood of Nati∣ons flows with a direct and united Torrent, into the Great Lake of Death, of which the general Vision gave the Description. Descend we then to the respective Parts.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>I. <HI>Vision of</HI> FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FRANCE</HI> feels the first Effects of this Emanation. The fiery <HI>Ef∣fluvia</HI> affect the Invincible Monarch, the Immortal Man, and give him sun∣dry Demonstrations of his neither be∣ing Invincible or Immortal. Likewise the Influence discovers to my elated View, that neither his Fame, nor his Glory, which is the boast of his Soul, is Immortal, any more than his Life. <HI>France,</HI> which gives the Sun in its full
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
Strength for its Device, sees with more than a common Horror this dreadful Eclypse, as a Forerunner of the Darkening the Rayes of their Mo∣narch's Lustre, and their Kingdom's Glory.</P>
<P>Infatuate in the Opinion of his com∣manding Power, and in order, <HI>Pha∣roah</HI> like, to his sudden Immersion, the mighty Man leads forth new Armies to the War. I see him just now influ∣enced by the fatal Decrees, laying the Foundation of the Ruine of his Glory in Espousing the Ambitious and Re∣vengeful <HI>Swede:</HI> The <HI>Gothick</HI> Heroc shall be delivered from the low Cir∣cumstances he is now involved in; Chariots of Fire descend from the Mountains of the <HI>West</HI> to his Support: The <HI>Eastern</HI> Powers are scattered before him; he extends his Arms to take strong Vengeance upon those who, in his meaner State, pusht at his Destruction: Behold the young Martial Man in Flames of War, triumphs over the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> distresses the <HI>Dane,</HI> and struggling with the <HI>Poles,</HI> gives Peace on that Side, that he may turn his vi∣ctorious Arms to assist his Supporter, who now wants him, and to afford
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
him powerful Help, in a manner equal to the Assistance received from him.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> engaging thus to deliver the <HI>Martial Swede,</HI> embarks <HI>Europe</HI> in new Alliances against himself, to prevent that Greatness which, upon the Con∣junction of the <HI>Gothick Power,</HI> appears too formidable to the World: The Au∣gust Monarch, cover'd with Years, victory, and Craft, boldly arms in de∣spight of the World; and the Terrors of War amaze <HI>Europe,</HI> but the Influ∣ence prevails; Mighty <HI>Lewis</HI> in his full strength of Pride and Glory suffers an <HI>ECLYPSE.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ambition</HI> and Lust of Rule arms Fa∣ctions and Parties in <HI>France,</HI> and threat∣en that Illustrious Kingdom with uni∣versal Confusion. <HI>Lewis,</HI> neither dead nor living, for a while remains <HI>Soul-less</HI> as to Government; the <HI>Lillies</HI> of <HI>France fade,</HI> the Kingdom threatned with Fo∣reign Desolations, as at Home with ci∣vil Dissentions, seeks Peace among their Neighbours; but it is deny'd, and she suffers exceeding Depredations and Calamities.</P>
<P>At the End of this threatning Stream, appears a small Brightness from the <HI>North,</HI> which, for a time, ex∣tends
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
it self over whole <HI>Gallia. France</HI> in Distress, seeks Aid from the <HI>Swede;</HI> made strong and victorious by her Assistance. The <HI>Gothick Prince</HI> appears smiling, pleased that he is able to re∣turn the Benefit. Here the vision shews the grateful <HI>Swede</HI> in full March to the Banks of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and concur∣ring with the ancient Prophetick Disco∣very of the <HI>Second-Sighted Cowil,</HI>
<Q><L>Pushes from <HI>Pomeren</HI> unto <HI>Sluce.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> revives by the Assistance of the <HI>Northern</HI> Prince, recovers Strength, and faces its Enemies, and is victori∣ous in a great and bloody Battle in the <HI>North East</HI> of her Dominions, per∣haps not far from <HI>Sluce;</HI> yet the ex∣tended Sight continues to see <HI>France</HI> labouring, with the utmost Applica∣tion, to obtain Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Peace</HI> restor'd to <HI>France</HI> after great Suffering; but its Monarch not re∣stor'd, like <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> dies; and intestine Feuds afflict that Nation for two Years and 10 Months; after which the Influence of the great Eclypse shall extend farther in the Fate of the <HI>French,</HI> tho' how far is not discovered. Much
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
of the Loss, Ruine, and Devastation, which <HI>France</HI> suffers from abroad in her calamitous Condition, may be gather∣ed from what is discovered in the Vi∣sion of other Countries, with whom this Kingdom is necessarily embarrass'd by the War; but the Vision ends not yet, a black portentous Line is drawn cross the Zenith of this King∣dom.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> feels <HI>other Calamities</HI> than those of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Dissention;</HI> the Contagion which visits <HI>Europe,</HI> passes not lightly here, entring by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> traverses a third Part of the Kingdom, and pas∣ses either into <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> making great Devastation.</P>
<P>Let <HI>France</HI> likewise expect calami∣tous Blasts as well as Tempests, to the Ruine of Naval Interests, as in such as affect the Fruits of the Earth, to the great impoverishing and Ruine of their People.</P>
<P>The Calamities of <HI>France</HI> are not yet ended, though Clowds and Dark∣ness close the present Discovery; I see a gathering of the People, and Flash∣ings of Light amidst the Abyss of Darkness, denoting terrible Dissentions, perhaps a most cruel Civil War break∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
out in the Bowels of their Coun∣try; whether Matters of State, or of Religion, begin the Quarrel, I yet dis∣cern not; but am guided, by this un∣erring Vision, to foretel that an effectu∣al Breach among Ecclesiasticks in <HI>France,</HI> by the Incendiaries on both sides, blown up into a Flame, shall embroil that un∣happy Nation in the most cruel War that ever yet befel since they were a People; in which Superstition shall sink, true Religion recover Strength, her Banished return, <HI>France</HI> casts off the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke, and becomes the Glory of the Church of God.</P>
<P>While this part of the Vision enli∣vens the Mind, and dilates the serene Optick, a smiling Ray shone from the Sun now recover'd from the Eclypse, and discover'd <HI>France</HI> glittering in Gold and Glory, the Queen of the whole Earth, embraced and become one with those Nations which were before her Enemies; no more the jealousies of her Exorbitances and of her encroach∣ing Power affect her weaker Neigh∣bours; no more ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns Tyranis fill her Throne; she is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Re∣ligion, the Bulwark of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce, and the Hand by which the R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med

Interest extends it self to a Superiority over the Christian World: What can∣not Heaven direct, and what may not <HI>France,</HI> when become a converted faith∣ful <HI>Ally,</HI> do, at the Head of a Protestant Conjunction, to root out Idolatry, Pa∣ganism, and Mahometism, from the World.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>2 <HI>Vision,</HI> SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>TUrning to the East, the disturb'd Element soon discover'd a gene∣ral Eruption of Fire, like a vast <HI>Vol∣cano,</HI> by the Light whereof the clear Celestial Sight, with perfect Perspe∣ctive inlightned, saw those Parts of the World engag'd in furious Commo∣tions and Distractions, understood by our People in common by the Nor∣thern War. Here Four mighty Nati∣ons conspire to crush the <HI>Swedes;</HI> some of them the same who, in former Wars, received the most effectual Support and Establishment from the same <HI>Swedish</HI> Power, which they seek now to de∣stroy.</P>
<P>The Westermost Branch of this Con∣slagration respects the <HI>Danes,</HI> they are
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
represented to my Sight as a Nation perfidious; twice by Breach of League and unjust Depredation falling upon their inoffensive Neighbour the <HI>Swede;</HI> The Darts point at them, they are de∣stin'd for Punishment; twice have they received the Scourge, but without tak∣ing Warning; hardned as <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> they persist in pursuing their unjust Attacks, but prosper not; they are corrected by the Hand that they despised, and they are made a Prey.</P>
<P>They struggle hard, and receive Assi∣stance from their Alliances, but oblig'd to suffer, submit at last, and obtain Peace, reduc'd, and poor.</P>
<P>A Sea-Fight happens between them and the <HI>Swedes,</HI> much Blood streams down, but it appears to the penetrating Eye the <HI>Red Cross</HI> shrinks back, and the <HI>Stand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elen</HI> gains, tho' a dear∣bought great Victory. This is the last Effort of that Potentate by Sea, not being in a Condition to fit out another Fleet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedish</HI> King breaks forth from the narrow Limits wherein he seem'd confin'd by the Neighbour Power of a Prince, who in a dishonourable manner assumes to prescribe him by Laws of
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
his own; assisted by <HI>France,</HI> he faces to his Enemies, several hot Engagements happen, Battles and Skirmishes innu∣merable; but in one fatal and bloody Fight he gets the Victory over a haugh∣ty and barbarous Enemy, and pushes him a second time into the Frontiers of his Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Far North</HI> the Vision rises in Fire and Blood, representing the hardy <HI>Muscovite</HI> advancing where never any yet appear∣ed, and adventuring to compass the <HI>Bothnick Gulf,</HI> marching his Armies o∣ver Mountains of Snow, unpassable Bogs and Rivers, through a Country unable to subsist Friend or Enemy, in order to pierce into the Bowels of that Kingdom, which was once a Terror to the whole <HI>Muscovite</HI> Empire. Here they are met with by a Prince allied to <HI>Sweden,</HI> at the Head of an inferior Ar∣my, but are Fought with, check'd, and in several bloody Encounters their Numbers diminish'd, and a Stop put to their hardy Enterprize; they retreat with Shame and Dishonour, but not in∣tirely expulsed till new Attacks from other Quarters call them off to relieve their own Country, and to defend themselves from the Impression of fu∣rious
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
Enemies in other parts of their Dominions.</P>
<P>Here appear Signs of great Distress to <HI>Sweden,</HI> press'd for a while by the Invasion of the <HI>Barbarians;</HI> but she rises from the calamitous Circumstances by the invincible Courage and Vigilance of her <HI>King,</HI> made strong by the Assistance of some Potentates, who cannot think it reasonable to see so great a part of the ancient Strength of <HI>Europe,</HI> over∣run and destroy'd by a Power rather to be feared than courted, and less fit to be made a Friend of, than to be timely crush'd, and prevented from growing too great an Enemy for <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swede,</HI> assisted by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Power, proves victorious in many Engagements, reduces most of his Invaders to the Necessity of making Peace, and in his turn pushes the rest to Extremities; but is call'd off to assist <HI>France,</HI> press'd in its turn by a heavy War. The <HI>Swede</HI> extricates his Ally out of great Difficulties, and returns Home hardly yet able to give entire Peace to his own Dominions.</P>
<P>The Vision discovers <HI>Poland</HI> distress'd by the Power of the <HI>Swedes</HI> on one hand, and a threatned Invasion of the <HI>Maho∣tans</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
on the other; struggling with dis∣united Circumstances at Home, a di∣vided People, and attended with all the Miseries which National Divisions generally bring upon themselves. The Vision represents <HI>Poland</HI> as a Plan of Humane Confusion; nor does our clear∣est Sight shew an End of the Miseries to which this unhappy, impoverished, but proud Nation is expos'd, being at last involved in a bloody War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> who with an innumerable Army over-run the South Parts of their Country, and carry the miserable In∣habitants into Slavery.</P>
<P>Is it possible that when these mighty Events, or such as these, are found, who following so naturally so great a Con∣junction in the Heavenly Bodies, which Bodies we know have particular Influ∣ences upon the Works of Nature, and the Temper and Minds of Men; yet that no Coherence should be between the Signal and the Event! Has not the Scripture told us there shall he Signs in Heaven, and Signs on the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and that then we should expect what shall befal the World?</P>
<P>Those to whom this Power of clear intellectual Vision is granre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, wonder
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
at the impenetrable Stupidity of Men, who so obstinately withstand the Light of their Reason, and the natural Co∣herence of things one with another, see∣ing their being able to give the Reason, shew the Nature and Courses of E∣clypses, Comets, &amp;c. does not in the least tye up the Great Director of Na∣ture from appointing them as Signals of approaching Judgments; nor of be∣ing in some measure the Causes of those Operations, by which those Judgments are brought to pass in the Course of Nature, as the Influence which they have upon Nature, the Elements, and the Bodies of Men, may make appear.</P>
<P>This <HI>Second Sight</HI> being inlightned from the sublime Fountain of Intelle∣ctual Knowledge, sees clearly the man∣ner of these things, and, antecedent to their Operation, has an incommunica∣ble Knowledge of the Events, seeing what is to be before it appears in Na∣ture, and seeing into those Causes of Things which are hidden from the World.</P>
<P>By virtue of this sublime Vision, the aforesaid Eclypse of the Sun appears to the enlightned Eye big with porten∣tous Events, furnished from Nature, to
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
procure as well as to foretel the vari∣ous Calamities with which Heaven designs to afflict Mankind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>3 VISION.</HEAD>
<P>IT was Time for the inquisitive Eye to turn towards the Part respect∣ing its native Soil, not being able to restrain a Curiosity, in which it had so much real Concern.</P>
<P>I cannot feign in the Discovery of what I perceive impends in the Fate of this <HI>Island;</HI> the Eclypse passes over the Middle of the <HI>English</HI> Part of this Island, central and total. Its Influ∣ences affect essentially the whole, por∣tending Felicity after some brief Inter∣val, but heavy things likewise in the Course of Time. A bright Ray chas∣ing a Clowd big with evil Omens, ap∣pears over the South; the Fate deter∣mined for the Nation, is happily su∣perseded; the Minds of Men much agitated, and some Signs tending to Blood; but discovered to be no other, in the Issue, than the Blood of Crimi∣nals, shed in due Regard to the Safe∣ty
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
of the Publick, and, perhaps, in crushing Rebellion and Treason.</P>
<P>Our exalted View of things to come, is not without a just Retrospect on things past; and here, by the penetrat∣ing Power of this Illumination, is disco∣ver'd to me that of things done in the last Years; the Designs of Men point∣ed at different Matters than such as they pretended: Heaven, for the de∣tecting Crime, and stripping the Guil∣ty of the Protection of supreme Dig∣nity, summon'd the Prince to resign, and remov'd the Hand on whom the Scepter of Power was devolv'd.</P>
<P>The Scene of Vision changing here, represented remote, and aspiring a pleasant Clowd, enlighten'd with se∣raphick Flame, and surrounding a crowned Appearance, shapeless, but amiable, noting the remov'd Person exalted and accepted, and declar'd in∣nocent of the Mischiefs design'd to the Countries committed to the Rule of her Scepter, tho' politically abused, and made to skreen the Crimes of Men, as if they had been her own.</P>
<P>An Opening here appear'd in the Ray celestial, through which shone a bright, livid Fire, and in the Flame
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
written, DELIVERANCE and ESTABLISHMENT. From this Ray, importing a Succession of Power, enclined to deliver a betray'd Nation, and to establish Peace on the Foundations of Liberty and Civil Right.</P>
<P>Before this penetrating Ray, Guilt fled as Darkness before the Sun, and the Enemies of the new Throne came in daily, offering Submission, and pe∣nitential Confessions; Justice sat on the Right Hand, cloath'd with Emi∣nency; and yet shaking Hands with Clemency, and with Power irresisti∣ble, restored the Nation.</P>
<P>Yet, after all this Felicity, there ap∣pears impending Darkness, and Clowds hover, and Storms gathering, threat∣ned asflicting things to a People un∣thankful for Deliverances, often en∣joy'd by Wonders. Wisdom, Prudence, and Integrity reigns; but Heaven is not always appeas'd that Way; a just Power over an unthankful People doubles the Ingratitude, and alarms sovereign Power to summon his Ven∣geance for their Correction.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28"/>
I fear, at the looking through this first Glorious Light, I say I fear, the rising Vision flamed with Tokens of Judgments, which eclypse our Joy. In vain shall a rightous Prince interpose for Time past, it shall be His Glory and Reward, that this Isle shall be re∣stored to firm Establishment and Peace, through his Administration; but what Posterity may enjoy, may be sweetned by what their Fathers suffered.</P>
<P>Advancing now, there represents to my View dark and thick Resemblan∣ces, signifying Discontents, Murmurs, and Uneasiness of People, rather at one another, than at their Sovereign; striv∣ing, with inveterate Rage, to over∣throw and supplant one another.</P>
<P>The vision represents this spreading over the Center of the Nation. On the first view, it threatned War and Civil Broil; but the penetrating Sight having a view beyond present things, there appears the Sovereign, vested not only with Power enough to quell, but with Temper, Wisdom, and Coun∣cil, to calm the Tempests of Mens Minds on either Side. This being from Heaven communicated as a Branch
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
of celestial Bounty, I saw clearly both the contending Parties had turned their Strife to this particular, not to injure the Prince himself, but to sup∣plant each other in his Favour.</P>
<P>Yet it appears, this Contention shall be push'd on with as much vigor, Ea∣gerness, and Fury, as if it had been the mortal Strife of a Civil War.</P>
<P>Great Strivings of Course fall in here, to make the Opposition of one Side be thought Rebellion against the Prince, and to be punished as such. In this the Success does not answer the Design; for Interest of private Ambition separating Men from Truth, and divesting them of the Principles of Honour and Justice, discovers that evil Men guide the Publick, under Pretence of Good, in all Ages, and among all Parties.</P>
<P>A piercing Flash, which struck Light through otherwise impenetrable Darkness and Clowd, discovered to me, that the Prince, exalted by Hea∣ven, shall, with a piercing Eve, per∣ceive Deceit, Hypocrisy, and selfish Principles, to be the Pole-star of every Party; and that the most Pretending have remote views, which they pursue
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
with a Reserve of Ambition and Pride, covered with the specious Clothing of publick Zeal.</P>
<P>This Penetration given from Hea∣ven, alarms the Prince to suppress con∣tending Parties, by a strong Arm; tak∣ing the Reins of Government into his own Hands, and letting the contending People know, they are no longer to be the Implements of vanity and Lust, in the Hands of ambitious Men, by whom they are made a Prey; but that they may operate in their own Deliverance, under his Protection. Happy Nation! if this Day shall e∣ver come: May the vision not fail in this Part, whatever else may be un∣certain. <HI>Happy</HI> had this Scene been acted in Years behind us, then had Civil Peace covered <HI>Britain,</HI> as the Waters cover the Sea; Rivers of Blood had not streamed from this I∣sland, as from a Fountain supplying the great Lake of Death; the Strife of Men had never risen to those Heights, as to eclypse the Light of Reason, trampling under Foot Peace, Truth, Charity, good Manners, and even natural Affection.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31"/>
From this pleasing, but terrible Impression of Light through the thick Darkness, which, surrounding the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Hemisphere, closed my vision; On the <HI>North</HI> Side, I was guided to a view of happier Times to this Island, than our Fore-fathers have ever seen. But <HI>Britains</HI> may mark it, for their Affliction, that as Heaven has merci∣fully averted their impending Ruine, so the Felicity, and Days of Harmony, which shall bless this Land, stand re∣mote; and, possibly, shall not be seen by this Age, whose willing Broils have been the Fruit of their own Gust to Strife; and who, delighting in Contention, propagating the Mis∣chiefs which have produced their con∣tinued Uneasiness, have unqualified themselves for the Halcyon of Party-Peace; and a Generation to come, who know not the Reason of these Follies, being blessed with a better Spirit, are reserved for the Enjoyment of a serene Peace at Home, which their Fathers understood nothing of.</P>
<P>They who have innate Principles of Love to their Country, rejoice in the distant view of the Felicities of Poste∣rity,
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
though they have no Part there∣in.</P>
<P>Here the exalted Sight obtain'd a vision, portending the Destruction of all Party-Administrations in the Days yet to come; the great black Clowd pierced, as above, by the Glance or Flash of penetrating Light, seeming to be struck as with a Thunderbolt, broke in an inconceivable Diversity of Parts, like a strong Fortification, blown up by a thousand Barrils of Powder. Faction, Cabal, cemented Parties, and all the secret little Knots, and Setts of Politicians, State-Disturb∣ers, and Devourers of Nations, who, brooding on the Nests of Wickedness, sat to hatch Oppression, Tyranny, Re∣bellion, Dissention, and the usual Mischiefs of an embroiled State in this Nation, appeared at one Blast, by the sagatious Breath of a wise Governour, dissipated, disjointed, separated, and entirely dispersed into independent A∣toms. Malice became meerly personal, and walked alone; Ambition was o∣verwhelmed in the Rubbish of her own fougader Party, suffered Death ir∣retrievable and eternal; for Faction and Party can have no Resurrection
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
in the impartial Sway of a wise and just Prince.</P>
<P>Amaz'd at this surprising Blast, at which all the Miseries of my native Country must necessarily come to their Period; Thought suggested this eager mental Enquiry, or rather wishing E∣jaculation, <HI>When shall these Things be?</HI> when likewise, without the Help of any Voice, the Motion of the Bodies in my View being swift, seemed to dictate these Words, THE TIME HASTETH.</P>
<P>If the Rapture be just, if the en∣lightned Beam deceive not, and why should sublime Vision deceive? If the <HI>Second Sight</HI> has prevailed, and the Discovery be real, <HI>The Time Hasteth,</HI> when <HI>Strife, Division,</HI> and the very Foundations on which Contentions of Men, and the Parting a Nation into Factions and Classes, trampling Laws, Religion, Charity, and Peace under the Feet of Pride, Avarice, and Ambition, shall be torn up by the Roots; the Parties which govern our Princes, and divide our People, shall be entirely dispers'd and blown up, and just Princes shall in Peace govern an Obedient and United People. <BIBL>AMEN, O GOD.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34"/>
But these Things are not yet; nearer to my View, appears dark Intervals, and Clouds of evil Vapour, which in∣tercept the Approaching Glory, Eclips∣ing its Brightness, and perhaps keep it for a while at remote Distance, ad∣journing the Enjoyment, till the Wil∣derness of Distraction be passed over.</P>
<P>These describe to the enlightned View, Eclypses of present Happiness, as the Effect of the great Eclypse of the Sun's Light.</P>
<P>Viewing then the spatious Arch or Extent of the Hemisphere, to see to which Part these portending Vapours pointed; I see <HI>Ireland</HI> under the Po∣sition of the Sign <HI>Taurus,</HI> in which the present Heavenly Sign appears: Troops of Humane Plagues issuing forth from the Rear of those Exhalations sally upon that Part of the World; Perhaps they shall touch Iightly that Island, <HI>Heaven grant it!</HI> and pass the Ocean into <HI>Spain;</HI> the sallying Terrors lose not their Power by the Breadth of the Sea they pass over; where they fix, they threaten Dearth and Sterrility of Soil, Plagues, and Death of Cattle, and the Demise of great Men.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35"/>
In the Line of this Fury direct stand the Kings of <HI>Spain, Sicily,</HI> the Ecclesiastick Monarch, the Doges of <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> the <HI>Tuscane</HI> Grand Duke, the Grand Seignior, the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> with several Kings in the lower <HI>India,</HI> or <HI>Extra Gan∣gem</HI>—Stand clear Monarchs! When Heaven strikes, ye fall, as Corn to the Sickle, or Grass to the Scythe. The Vi∣sion represents Funeral Obsequies of Princes and great Monarchs in this ex∣tended Line, at least five in Number.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Part <HI>Ireland</HI> bears in this threat∣ned Evil, extends to Loss of Cattle, Dearth of Corn, stormy Seas, to the Ruine of Shipping, and the like, and go no farther, she escapes very well, and may be reserv∣ed for a farther Time; but all the Views my clearest Sight represents to me on that side appear threatning and dark.</P>
<P>This island shares with the neighbour∣ing World, the Influences of the great E∣clypse, her <HI>Sotuhern</HI> Parts see it Center∣al and Dreadful; nor shall the Influences which Nature admits from that great Incident be wanting; perhaps great Sickness and Mortality. I see not indeed a general Plague, at least not yet; how∣beit, it seems great Numbers of People die, and an <HI>unusual</HI> Number of <HI>Lords</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
and great Men. The Appearances of threatning Distempers are strong and lasting, Nature suffering the Excess of <HI>poisonous</HI> Particles, spreading and disperst thro' the Atmostphere, feels Convulsions of the common Kind, and the mortal Ef∣fect upon Humane Bodies is to be ex∣pected without wonder.</P>
<P>But the Eclypse ends not here, a Dark∣ning the Hope of immediate Resettlement, may with great Justice be observed, and the Vision mention'd the bright Appea∣rance, to an enlightn'd Optic, discovers plainly perturbations of many <HI>Kinds,</HI> War threatned, and with great Prudence and D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficulty avoided, some <HI>wild</HI> At∣tempts made to <HI>embroil</HI> the World being by good Conduct stav'd off</P>
<P>And now looking to the <HI>East,</HI> I see a great Flash of <HI>Fire,</HI> the <HI>Noise</HI> loud, but the End Smoke, the intelligent <HI>Soul</HI> sees in this, a fruitless Attempt, <HI>Qui fatez mille traca,</HI> a mighty Noise, threatning Invasion, War, and Depredation upon <HI>Great Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain;</HI> the pretending Enemy making much stir, loud Boasts, and Cloathing himself with infinite Plumes of Feathers, Trophies of his own <HI>Imagi∣nation,</HI> mov'd along with a swift Pace to∣wards this Island; but I see him, I repeat
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
it, being illuminated to see the approach∣ing Deliverance, I see him vanish into Smoke, noisome and contemptible, his Cloud vanish'd in a Blast, his Feathers are pluck'd off, and blown up into the Air, and the weak Creature dies con∣temptible.</P>
<P>This is the last Affliction of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> in the Ashes of the encroaching Youth, she revives, and her <HI>Liberties flourish,</HI> not to be again <HI>insulted</HI> by any.</P>
<P>The View of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Sufferings in these Attacks of pretending <HI>Enemies</HI> is melancholy, nor is the Duration short; but I see the Enemy decline his strength abroad, weak his Hope, at home de∣feated, and his End at length is <HI>De∣struction.</HI></P>
<P>Looking farther into the Aspects of Things, behold, a neighbouring State a little concern'd in the Effects of the great Conjunction. Their low and ma∣rine <HI>Scituation,</HI> concurs with the deter∣mined Fate; the Visitation of Heaven reaches from hence, and stretching thro' the lower <HI>Germany,</HI> affects the Coasts and Places nearest the Sea, with cread∣ful Contagion both among Men and Beasts: No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ends it there, the Impres∣sion

<HEAD>4 <HI>Vision,</HI> EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE enlightned View of sublunary Things, lead me next to observe the Fate of the other Kingdoms of the World, and what share they have in the threatning Aspect of the Heavenly Bodies; and here, I see endless Trou∣bles perplexing the World, the Empire involv'd in the Disorders of its own Body, wisely declines embarking in a War on this side. Great struggles of Politicians are seen to bring the <HI>Em∣perour</HI> into a new Alliance against the <HI>French,</HI> but he cannot be prevail'd with; the Approaching Dangers of <HI>Turkish</HI> Eruption are a Bridle on his Neck, and though no Fighting, yet he is obliged to keep his Forces waking, and upon the Guard.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39"/>
I am surpris'd with a Torrent from the Side of the <HI>Eastern</HI> World, the <HI>Turks</HI> pour in their prodigious Multitudes up∣on the Isles of the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> and having been successful against the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI> fall upon <HI>Malta, Sicily,</HI> or the Coast of <HI>Calabrian, Italy,</HI> perhaps all: <HI>Malta</HI> Invincible, resists all the Efforts of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but <HI>Sicily</HI> suffers ve∣ry much, if not totally over-run; they attempt <HI>Italy,</HI> but not with Capital For∣ces, so the sacred Patrimony escapes for this time. The <HI>Venetians</HI> act faintly, and as it were unconcerned, and the Le∣thargy remains, tho' their Coasts are insulted, their Armies routed, and the <HI>Turks</HI> threaten their Dominions on the <HI>Terra Firma.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor strengthens his Fron∣tiers, and appears invulnerable. But the <HI>Tartars</HI> ravage the Frontiers of <HI>Po∣land</HI> and <HI>Circasia;</HI> the black View of Things on this side of the World, threatens universal War and Blood. Heaven visits the World in Anger, and one Nation becomes a Scourge to another.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40"/>
Here the Eclypse of the Sun is less Central, appears less Portentous of Con∣tagion and Disease; but the Influence extends to animate the Minds of Men to rage and blood, and many great ones fall in these Wars.</P>
<P>The Vision represents here, great Battles, and Multitudes cut in Pieces by the Sword; yet, according to the Power of wise Discerning, the <HI>Turk</HI> shall not prevail; for on that side, the Powers of Confederated Princes u∣niting to restrain him, and falling up∣on him when Victorious, drives him back.</P>
<P>A great <HI>European</HI> Monarch will take the grand Tour of <HI>Death</HI> in this War; I see not yet, whether of <HI>Poland, Muscovy,</HI> or the Northern Crowns; I see a Representation of a Falling Crown Im∣perial, attended by prostrate Nobles not a few. The Number of Generals, Prin∣ces, and great Men, which will fall in the Conflagration of a general War will be many.</P>
<P>Beyond all the dismal Appearances of Bloodshed and Ruine attending, I see Peace, but walking a slow Pace and remote, Portending that it shall be
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
late, difficult, and not till after great Calamities are suffered in the World; yet she comes on approaching the con∣tending Parties, courting her only so long, and no longer, as they see their Side, their Interest, and their Strength declining.</P>
<P>Thus by the Views of the approach∣ing Year, the contemplating Mind discerns the World afflicted with in∣numerable Mischiefs, War, Faction, Ambition, Pestilence, Dearth, De∣struction of Cattle, of Cities, and of Kingdoms, Fall of great Men, Prin∣ces, and Kings. The Light of the discerning Faculty describes where, by whom, and in what Manner, much of this shall come to pass; believing that the eminent Conjun∣ction of the heavenly Bodies, where∣by the great and glorious Light of the Sun shall be thus totally e∣clypsed and darkned, is not only portentous of, but very much in∣strumental in the Confusions, which happen among the Nations.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS eminent Prophe∣tick Person, resident in the remotest Parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> having thus transmitted his Ob∣servations on the E∣clypse; and his Pre∣dictions, by Virtue of the great and unknown Quality of the Se∣cond Sight: Many of which have been written some Months ago.</P>
<P>The Publisher hereof thinks they can give no Offence to let the
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
World see them, however extrava∣gant they may appear. It is true, that Philosophers being able to give a clear Account of the Nature, as well as Courses of Eclypses, make sport with, and ridicule all the Notions of their being portentous and predicting; but some are of the Opinion, as the Author above, that Signs in the Heavens, and in the Earth, are not wholly to be neglected, although the natural Causes thereof may be accounted for; and that Providence frequently warns the World of approaching Judgments, by such Events as are, in them∣selves, meerly natural; and there are many Reasons to be given for this Opinion; but none more clear than the Evidence of Antiquity, where the like has been known to precede, or accompany dreadful Ca∣lamities, or extraordinary Events.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> have told us, That there was a Central total Eclypse of the Sun before the General Deluge. We all know, there cannot be a greater Eclypse than this that is now at
<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
hand; what it may Portend, God only knows: But as we shall not venture to say, all the Things in the above Account shall happen, no nor any of them, and every one is at Liberty to take the above Account either for a real Prediction, or a fictitious Fabulous Ramble of the Fancy; for we will impose nothing yet; neither on the other hand will we dare to say, that such Great Conjunctions of the heavenly Bodies have no Signification; much less will we presume to say, as some do, that it is impossible they should.</P>
<P>The Influence of the Heavenly Bo∣dies on the Sublunary and Elemen∣tary Species is denied by none; we see the Tides keeping an exact Rate or Pace with the Motion of the Moon; D stempers breeding in Creatures are all visibly influenced by them, Horses are blind, Lunaticks Raving, Hypo∣condriack Fits strong at the full of the Moon. The sweet Influences of the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> and the Bands of <HI>Orion,</HI> mentioned in <HI>Job,</HI> confirm the Influ∣ences of the Stars.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
Humane Actions likewise are visibly influenced by the Planets or other Stars in their Motions, what else means that Text, <HI>The Stars in their Course fought against Sisera;</HI> if so, then doubt∣less that Influence is doubled, or o∣therwise encreased on the extraor∣dinary Conjunction, <HI>Opposition,</HI> or other uncommon Incidents of the Motion of those Heavenly Bodies: And he who has made the Moon and the Stars, we think, can by no means be denied the Privilege as well as the Capacity of Directing them to predict the Greatest things which He has de∣termined to do, and to appoint them to be Signs of, and Warnings to Na∣tions, in the Case of impending Judg∣ments.</P>
<P>As to the Visions here mentioned, the Reader is left at full Liberty to put as little Weight on them as he pleases; the main End and Design of the whole being to prevent the A∣theistical Influence of those, who take off our Eyes so effectually from them, as to turn all the Awe and
<PB N="46" REF="46" MS="y"/>
Reverence which some would pay to the Power of the God of Nature, by whom these Events are directed, into Jest and Ridicule; and take the Power of making these things pre∣dictive quite out of his Hands, as if He could not so order the Great and Terrible Works of his Provi∣dence to attend the Course of Na∣tural Motions, as to make one a re∣gular Forerunner of the other.</P>
