<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOEL, Chap. II. Ver. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, with Fasting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT Time this Prophet liv'd in, and what Sin, and remarkable Events, his Prophecy was con∣cern'd in (since he has no-where expresly told us), Interpreters have been divided in their Opinions: Nor shall I spend your Time, in reconciling their different Judg∣ments.</P>
<P>This is certain, that the State and Con∣dition of those Times was extremely sad, and deplorably calamitous, as is plain from those full Descriptions in the First Chapter.</P>
<P>It is evident likewise, that the <HI>Jews</HI> ex∣pected more dreadful and troublesome Days from a foreign Invasion, which was break∣ing in upon them, as is here described, with
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>all those Horrors that can either appall or terrify; is painted in the most tragical Co∣lours, and with such a kind of Oratory, and such Strains, as the Prophets used of old; when with high and lofty Hyper∣boles they would foretel the utter Ruin of a People.</P>
<P>Thus, Verse 10. <HI>The Earth shall quake before them, and the Heavens shall tremble; the Sun and the Moon shall be dark, and the Stars shall withdraw their Shining.</HI></P>
<P>And, lest the very Thoughts of this hor∣rible Confusion, lest the Apprehensions of such amazing Danger, lest the Nearness of its Approach, should overwhelm their Spirits, and make them languish, faint, and die into Despair; God does by the Pro∣phet shew them, how they might appease his Anger, and stay his flaming Sword from the speedy Execution of Vengeance: And the Directions are laid down in the Words of the Text.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore also now, saith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, and with Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning.</HI></P>
<P>Which Words I shall fully explain; and then deduce some practical Inferences from them.</P>
<P>And, <HI>First,</HI> I shall inquire, What it is to turn unto God.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<P>Now, first, in the sacred and prophetic Style, those may be said to turn unto God, who, after they had revolted from him, and became Idolaters, were sensible of their Er∣ror, and returned to the true God.</P>
<P>Or, at least, those may be said to turn unto him, who, having from their very In∣fancy taken in the Superstitions of their Fathers, together with their Education, and been nourished and brought up under such Prejudices, as have been confirmed by Custom, and gathered Strength with Age, shall yet, upon wise and just Motives, change this unreasonable Religion, for one that is recommended by more sober Arguments than a bare Education can pretend to: And this, in the ordinary and common Expres∣sion, is call'd Conversion, or the Turning of a Man's Religion.</P>
<P>For those that have a sound and an orthodox Faith in God; those that honour God with all the possible Testimonies of an inward and an outward Reverence; those that draw nigh unto him with a Love full of Awe, but without slavish Fear; those that receive him into their Hearts and Souls, by delighting to meditate upon his Nature, and obey his Commands;</P>
<P>These are said, in Scripture-Phrase, to cleave fast to God; to be (as it were) close∣ly united to the Divine Nature; to draw
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>nigh unto God; to be one with him; to be his peculiar People; to be his adopted Sons.</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, those that for∣sake the true Religion, and embrace super∣stitious and idolatrous Rites, are said to forsake their God; to deny him; to reject him; to commit spiritual Whoredom; to turn their Backs upon him.</P>
<P>This then is the first Notion of turning unto God; namely, the quitting of Ido∣latry and Superstition, and owning and worshipping the true God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Those may be said to turn unto God, that are changed from Wicked∣ness to Piety; from Injustice, to Righteous∣ness; from a refractory stubborn Temper, to a yielding and obedient Disposition; from impure and filthy Manners, to chaste and clean Habits.</P>
<P>These are call'd the Friends of God: And this Turning does imply Repentance; an intire Change of Life and Manners: And the Scripture does in several Places prove our Obedience to God's Commands to be the certain necessary Fruits of our being turned unto God.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 2. Returning unto the Lord is explained by obeying his Voice: And in the lvth of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Verse 7. <HI>Let the Wicked forsake his Way, and the unrighteous
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>Man his Thoughts and let him return unto the Lord:</HI> And in the xiith of <HI>Hosea,</HI> Ver. 6. <HI>Therefore turn thou to thy God: Keep Mercy and Judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Those may be said to turn to the Lord, that are inwardly touched with a deep Sense of their own Vileness; and publicly express it by some visible Signs.</P>
<P>Thus, when the <HI>Ninevites</HI> fasted, and sat in Sackcloth and Ashes, <HI>Jonah</HI> iii. ver. 10. God saw their Works, that <HI>they turned from their evil Way.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Daniel</HI> tells us of himself, <HI>Daniel</HI> ix. ver. 3. <HI>I set my Face unto the Lord God, to seek by Prayer, and Supplications, with Fasting, and Sackcloth, and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>Without Controversy; as the Prophet chiefly intended, that Men should turn to God, in the Two former Senses; as he would have those be first in the Inten∣tion; so this last should be the first in Exe∣cution; as being a public Testimony of a Mind disposed to a sincere Repentance.</P>
<P>For it is evident from the Sacred Hi∣story, that the <HI>Jews</HI> in that Age had re∣volted from the Religion which <HI>Moses</HI> had prescribed them; and were fondly imitating the superstitious Practices of the Heathens.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<P>They were pleased with the Customs of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> how vile and base soever: They affected their cruel and bloody Sa∣crifices, their foolish and obscene Rites; and, out of a wild Zeal, they became con∣formable to their wretched Manners; which were so much below the Dignity of the human Nature, that the Devil seemed on Purpose to have invented them, to betray unwary Souls: For it is the highest Luxury of Hell, at once to abuse and enslave, and then to scorn and deride Mankind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that Law which was delivered by Angels, that Law which God himself gave the People from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> was neglected and disused, and al∣most quite forgot; whilst there was a Plague of Darkness, thicker than that of <HI>Egypt;</HI> a black impenetrable Cloud covered all the People: They were grosly ignorant: They were insolently haughty: The delicate Softness of the Effeminate; the Profuse∣ness of the Luxurious; the Insatiableness of the Covetous; and, the natural Offspring of these Vices, outrageous Cruelty; the heaviest Oppression; the most execrable Perfi∣diousness; all Kinds and Degrees of Wicked∣ness; made up the Character of the Nation.</P>
<P>And these Sins cry'd aloud for Ven∣geance; forged the Thunderbolts; and
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>compelled the God of Recompence to his <HI>strange Work,</HI> as the Prophet styles the Execution of his Judgments.</P>
<P>And Woe be to the Inhabitants of the Earth, when God is angry! Who can wrestle with the Almighty, or stand in Opposition to the Great God? The whole World is but as Stubble, before this consuming Fire: The Day of the Lord is great, and very terrible; and who can abide it?</P>
<P>Therefore also now, saith the Lord, <HI>Turn ye unto me, if you would prevent these Judgments; change your wicked Customs; amend your Lives; and, as ye have pub∣licly imitated the Ceremonies of the</HI> Hea∣then, <HI>so give some public Testimony of your Sorrow: Turn ye unto me with all your Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>And this Conversion must be attended with Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning: Which needs no laborious Explanation.</P>
<P>By Fasting, nothing less is meant, than a Religious Abstinence, for some time, from the Kinds and Quantity of our Diet.</P>
<P>And for this no Rules can exactly be laid down; since Mens Constitutions are vastly different: Some can fast with Ease, others cannot do it: The only sure Me∣thod is, to measure our Fast, by its pro∣moting
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>our Devotions; and where it hath that Effect, it is a truly Religious Fast.</P>
<P>By Weeping and Mourning, Men out∣wardly express their inward Sentiments to others; either by a natural Instinct, or by the received Custom of the World: For, when a dead Weight hangs heavily upon the Soul, it is naturally eased by a Shower of Tears.</P>
<P>Now, from the Text thus explained, with reference to the Context, I deduce these Three general Heads of Practical Discourse:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That, to appease God's Indigna∣tion, and avert his Judgments, nothing can be more effectual, than a serious Re∣pentance, and an hearty (intire) Refor∣mation of our Lives and Manners.</P>
<P>And, tho' this might be proved by great Variety of Testimonies and Exam∣ples from the Scripture; since the Pro∣phets by their awakening Threatenings, by their loud Complaints, by their warm pathetical Exhortations, had only one main End to carry on; which was either to fright, or persuade and move, Men to Repentance;</P>
<P>Yet I shall wholly pass by those well-known Instances, and endeavour to prove my Assertion, by <HI>Rational Arguments.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<P>The first of which shall be taken from the natural Genius and Temper of Man∣kind, upon whom any Calamities are in∣flicted.</P>
<P>Whilst Men are immersed in vicious Habits; whilst they are Proficients in all the crooked Arts of Vice; whilst they indulge themselves in lewd abominable Customs;</P>
<P>It is impossible, but that they must dis∣please a God of infinite Purity, and pro∣voke his Indignation against them; they are not fit and proper Objects of his heaven∣ly Mercy; they are not capable of any Fe∣licity. They are in such a State, that the Divine Indulgence may mightily prejudice, but cannot do them any Kindness; the Favours of Heaven render them, not only worse, but more miserable, and uneasy to themselves and others.</P>
<P>The longer they are spared, the more are they confirmed in wicked Courses: Hence they never spend one Thought about Re∣pentance; they seem to have no Sense of their Guilt; their Hearts are hardened; their Consciences seared; they are deaf to the Threatnings and Terrors of the Lord; their Impurity heightens their audacious Folly, and they grow obstinate and intract∣able.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<P>They at once forget both God and themselves; and, because Sentence is not speedily executed upon them, therefore their Hearts are set in them, desperately set in them, to do wickedly.</P>
<P>They cease to take God for their Strength; and then they despise him, neg∣lect his Threats, and endeavour to dispute his Being out of the World. For it is a natural Step from an habitual Wickedness to downright Atheism.</P>
<P>For no Man ever yet denied a God, but his own Guilt made him first wish, there was none to punish him.</P>
<P>Now, before Men have quitted their be∣loved Vices, before they are resolved to change their Lives, and grow virtuous; is it fit, that either the Judgments, that Men feel, should be removed; or that God should extend his Loving-kindness to them?</P>
<P>But when they are ashamed of their Folly, and begin to be wise, then are they capable of Mercy; then will they gratefully ac∣knowledge and receive the Favours of Hea∣ven; and know how to use their good Fortunes reverently.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> My next Argument shall be taken from the Nature and Intention of temporal Punishments.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<P>For these are designed to amend what is amiss; and the Fury of God's Anger hath a Mixture of Love: He does cor∣rect us in Mercy, and chastise us like a Father.</P>
<P>The Physic may be bitter and ungrate∣ful; but it is to restore the Patient to his Health: The Caustic and Saw may look like Instruments of Cruelty; but milder Prescriptions would spread the Gangrene, and Lenitives prove fatal to the Man.</P>
<P>Afflictions are the true Purgatory of the Soul; they consume the Dross, and refine the whole Mass, and make it at once both pure and bright; they qualify us for Heaven.</P>
<P>And is it not necessary, that they should be laid upon us, till they had ac∣complish'd the Ends for which they were sent? Would it not be rather Cruelty than Mercy to us, to remove them before they had had their just Operation?</P>
<P>But, having done this Work, and re∣formed the Man, they are of no further Use: They that are whole, need not a Phy∣sician; and Afflictions come not to call <HI>the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> My last Argument shall be taken from the Nature of God himself, who mortally hates Sin.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<P>And the distant Poles may as soon unite, Heaven and Hell may as soon meet each other, as God be reconciled to a wicked impenitent Wretch, whilst he obstinately continues so.</P>
<P>Now Almighty God knows, what Mi∣sery and Trouble these careless Sinners ex∣pose themselves to; and he pities those that have no Compassion for their own immor∣tal Souls.</P>
<P>But yet he expresses his Tenderness in a Way agreeable to his Nature; by his Ex∣hortations and Threatnings: And, when he punishes, he strikes with Reluctancy: and seems to have inward Strivings: <HI>How shall I give thee up,</HI> Ephraim? <HI>My Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled.</HI></P>
<P>Turn unto the Lord your God; for he is merciful and gracious: He loves the Man, whilst he plagues the Sinner; and would not that any should perish, but that all Men should be saved.</P>
<P>From all which it is clear, that if we would have the Almighty lay aside his Dis∣pleasure; if we would have him be merci∣ful and gracious; if we would not have him manifest himself in devouring Flames; <HI>we should turn unto him.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<P>And we may humbly hope, that he will dart the chearful Rays of his serener Glories upon us, <HI>that he will lift up the Light of his Countenance upon us,</HI> and deliver us from those Evils which we may either fear, or labour under: For the only Expedient to appease his Anger, and be delivered from his Judgments, is, to turn unto him with all our Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From the second Explanation of turning unto God, which implies Re∣pentance, I cannot but infer, that a broken and a contrite Heart is the ready Way to avert God's Displeasure; which may be evinc'd by the Reason of the Thing itself.</P>
<P>Who is there, that, having found out the Plague of his own Heart; having been abundantly conscious of his wicked Life; what Happiness he has lost; what Misery he has madly plunged himself into;</P>
<P>Who is there, that considers how im∣piously, and unjustly, and ungratefully, he has behaved himself towards that gracious God, in whom he lives and moves, and has his Being?</P>
<P>Who is there that seriously reflects upon that Goodness which he hath abused, and upon that Power which he hath provoked?</P>
<P>Who is there that can deliberately me∣ditate upon his own Transgressions; his
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>heinous Iniquities; his intolerable Provo∣cations; and not be heartily angry and troubled, that he should ever be so vile and disengenuous?</P>
<P>And this Sorrow will not fail to work <HI>Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of.</HI></P>
<P>For no Man can be pleased with these Severities for their own sakes; no Man can delight in condemning himself; were it not in order to the raising such a Passion in himself against his Sins, as should settle and six into a deep Hatred of his past notorious Violations of his Duty: And that will produce a solicitous Care to avoid them for the Time to come</P>
<P>For who, that had escaped a Shipwreck would not industriously avoid the Rocks and Sands? Who, that had felt the Scorch∣ings of the Flames, would not cautiously dread a second Burning? And why should not he, that has felt the Whips and Lashes, the Stings and Goads, the Pangs and Throes, of an enraged Conscience, be as anxiously careful to escape its Fury; since Almighty God has declared that he is pleased with the Humble and the Contrite? He hath pro∣mised, the Mourners shall be comforted: He hath his Blessings for the Poor in Spi∣rit; is ready to forgive those that with un∣feigned Sorrow turn to him.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<P>He hath Balm to pour into the Wounds of a languishing Soul; he hath a Pardon ready to be sealed in his Son's Blood, for those that have been in Agonies for their Guilt; and are able, with an humble Great∣ness of Mind, to fill up that which is be∣hind of the Sufferings of Christ, <HI>Colossi∣ans</HI> i. Ver. 24.</P>
<P>He hath Refreshment, he hath Rest, for all that are weary and heavy-laden; for those that stoop down with Sorrow, and inflict a severe Penance upon themselves.</P>
<P>You see then, that, as ever we desire to have God be merciful to us, we must qualify ourselves for his Compassion, by repenting of our Sins, by turning unto him with a sorrowful Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> From the last Notion of turning to God, which implies our expressing some outward Signs of Trouble for our Sins, it may be inferred, That the Favour of God may be, in some measure, obtain'd by such a Behaviour; because he doth frequently injoin it.</P>
<P><HI>Seest thou how</HI> Ahab <HI>humbleth himself? Because he humbleth himself, I will not bring the Evil in his Days.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ninevites</HI> keep a strict Fast, and for that Reason their great City is spared: <HI>We fasted, and besought our God, for this;
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>and he was intreated of us,</HI> says <HI>Ezra</HI> viii. 23.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing, that these out∣ward Shews of Sorrow are called Repent∣ance in the holy Writ; for God is glori∣fied by these Austerities: They become the Condition and State of every true Peni∣tent; they tend to the Edification of our Brethren; they promote, and increase, and strengthen our Repentance; they are the Pledges, and the hopeful Beginnings of a thorough Reformation.</P>
<P>Now, of these, Fasting is one: And be∣cause <HI>this present Solemnity,</HI> and the Na∣ture of the Duty, seem to require it; and because it may be mistaken (whilst some may be too severe, and others too remiss); I shall more largely treat of it.</P>
<P>I do not find, in the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> any express Rules about the Observation of Fasts, nor any one particular Time recom∣mended for that religious Exercise.</P>
<P>Only, in the Laws about the Feast of Expiation, they are injoined to afflict their Soul by a Statute for ever, <HI>Lev.</HI> xvi. 31. And that, in the Original, signifies Fast∣ing.</P>
<P>But that they did institute both ordinary and extraordinary Fasts (though they had no positive Revelation about it), is plain
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>from the viiith Chapter of <HI>Zechariah,</HI> Ver. 19. where you hear of the Fast of the Fourth Month, and the Fast of the Fifth Month, and the Fast of the Seventh, and the Fast of the Tenth Month.</P>
<P>The Occasion of these Fasts was to pre∣serve a yearly Remembrance of the Tables of the Law, that were broken; of the Siege of their Imperial City <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> of the Temple, that was burnt to the Ground; and of the treacherous Murder of <HI>Gedaliah,</HI> who was barbarously slain by <HI>Ishmael, Je∣remiah</HI> xli. Ver. 2.</P>
<P>These were the common ordinary Fasts that were observed of old; and to this Day are observed by the modern <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these, they had their extraordi∣nary ones; such were those of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when the <HI>Benjamites</HI> had slain so many of them in Battle, <HI>Judges</HI> xx. 26. They wept, and sat before the Lord, and fasted that Day until Even. Such was that of King <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> when he dreaded the Incur∣sions of the <HI>Moabites</HI> and the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xx. 3. <HI>He feared, and set himself to seek the Lord; and he proclaimed a Fast throughout</HI> Judah.</P>
<P>Such likewise was that of <HI>Ezra,</HI> when he was about the great Work of Reforma∣tion; when he was to rebuild a Temple,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>to establish the Worship of God, and raise a City from its Ruins.</P>
<P>That private Men did for pious Reasons oblige themselves to fast, is clear from the Examples of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah;</HI> and those amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> that were look'd upon to be more devout than the Genera∣lity of the People, religiously fasted every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Thursday</HI> throughout the whole Year.</P>
<P>From whence it is highly probable, that the Custom of Fasting twice a Week (every <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>) amongst the primitive Christians took its Original: And this is almost as antient as the Apostles Days.</P>
<P>It is mentioned, as what was well known in <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Time, who was the first of all the <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers; and 'tis insisted on by <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> amongst the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if you please to consider the Ends and Advantages of Fasting: First, This doth naturally afflict and humble the Soul: Hence the Royal <HI>Psalmist</HI> confesses of him∣self, <HI>Psalm</HI> xxxv. 13. <HI>As for me, my Clothing was Sackloth, I humbled my Soul with Fasting.</HI> But, as a late Divine very happily expresses himself upon this Occasion, "Indeed (says he) <Q>the Soul that dwells in Dishes,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>“and is stewed in its own Luxuries, grows loose, and doth dissolve; all its Firmness forsakes it; the Man is strong for nothing but for Lusts; his Faculties are choaked and stifled; they stagnate, ”and are mired within him.</Q> (Dr. <HI>Ale∣stree</HI>). And it is impossible it should be otherwise.</P>
<P>For let a Man resolve to be never so virtuous, yet, except he doth as well pro∣secute the Means, as resolve upon the End, he shall never reach his Design.</P>
<P>For whilst I furnish my Table with the most exquisite Varieties; whilst I strain my Invention, to caress my Appetite; I am so far from striving against, that I am dieting myself for, the most dangerous Temptations.</P>
<P>But Fasting subdues the outrageous Pas∣sions, [puts a Bit and Bridle upon the Beast within us]; scatters all the gross Fumes that cloud the Understanding; and doth at once both clear the Head, and fill it with lower Thoughts of ourselves: It enables us to see our own Unworthiness.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This prepares us for spiritual Food, and qualifies the Soul for the Plea∣sures that are at God's Right Hand: It breaks asunder those Bonds that tied and fettered us to this lower sensual World:
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>It sets the Soul at Liberty, and wings it (as it were) for Heaven, by removing those dull Weights, that every Act of In∣temperance lays upon us.</P>
<P>But yet, to prevent Mistakes, an intire Fast does not do this: For Nature must have its Necessaries; and, whilst we deny it Superfluities, we must not pretend to be more than Men.</P>
<P>For, how often do we find ourselves mistaken; when we would therefore fast, that we might be more devout? Whilst Nature importunately recoils upon us; And, if we are obstinate in denying her, we may perhaps raise strong hypochondria∣cal Vapours; we may swell with Empti∣ness, but shall be unfit for any Acts of Devotion.</P>
<P>We should be temperate at all times; but, upon this solemn Occasion, we should revenge the Jollities, and Festivals, of the past Year, by Mortifications, and Self-denials; but still with such a Regard to our Constitutions, that we spoil not the good Work by overdoing it.</P>
<P>That Fast, and that alone, is acceptable to God, which strengthens the Soul, and makes it more active and vigorous in its Devotions.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Our Fasts have a mighty In∣fluence
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>upon our Prayers; whilst they with∣draw our Minds from sensual Pleasures: For such is the nimble desultory Motion of the Fancy, so quick is the Imagination, that, even when we would be serious, we are roving upon the little Vanities of a pleasant Con∣versation: We are ready to entertain our Thoughts with something that happened to ourselves, or the Company: And these <HI>Fowls</HI> (like those upon <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Car∣cases) light down upon, and interrupt our Devotions; with this fatal Difference, that he drove them away, <HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 11. whereas they prey upon us, and feed upon our Hearts.</P>
<P>Prayer and Fasting are the Heaven∣born Twins of pure Religion, and con∣stitute the Character of the truly Devout.</P>
<P>It is said of <HI>Anna</HI> the Prophetess, <HI>that she departed not from the Temple, but served God with Fasting and Prayers, Night and Day, St.</HI> Luke ii. 37.</P>
<P>The devout <HI>Cornelius</HI> tells us, <HI>that he was fasting until the Ninth Hour, and pray∣ing in his House;</HI> that is, he fasted till our Three of the Clock in the Afternoon; for that was their Ninth Hour: And then it was, <HI>that a Man stood before him in bright Clothing,</HI> Acts x. 30.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
<P>An Angel, clad in the shining Robes of Glory, descended and appeared with a Lustre round about him.</P>
<P>The Beams were awful, but still kind; and the Love of Heaven was shed upon him, in those chearful Rays.</P>
<P>The Fasts, that were kept before Sacred Orders were conferred in the Church, are as old as Christianity itself, <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23.</P>
<P>They prayed with Fasting, when they or∣dained Elders in every Church; and com∣mended them to the Lord:</P>
<P>As being well assured, that their Fasts had a mighty Efficacy upon their Prayers: That the Flame of their Devotion was bright and clear, and aspired with restless Ardors to the Throne of Grace; whilst the Spirits were re∣fined, and the earthy Mixture separated by Fasting; and the Men seemed no longer to have any human Thoughts about them.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Our Fasts are the Causes of many admirable Graces, which meet all together, like a glorious Constellation, in those that are thus abstemious.</P>
<P>They convince us of our Infirmities, and fill us with Compassion, towards our Brethren: For then do my Bowels earn after those that want, when, by this holy Discipline, I have chastised myself.</P>
<P>They that live softly and delicately, that stretch themselves upon their Beds of Ivory, and invent to themselves Instruments of Music, that frolick it in all Excess, are never grieved for the Afflictions of <HI>Joseph.</HI></P>
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
<P>But he that truly fasts, gives Alms; he deals his Bread to the Hungry, covers the Naked with a Garment; he hath a deep Sense of other Mens Calamities, and hides not him∣self from his own Flesh.</P>
<P>And this is such a Fast, as God hath chosen; it is sure to find Recompence; for, <HI>Then shall thy Light break forth, as the Morning; and thy Health shall spring forth speedily: Thy Righteousness shall go before thee, and the Glory of the Lord, shall be thy Reward.</HI> Isaiah lviii. Ver. 8.</P>
<P><HI>Then shall thy Light rise in Obscurity, and thy Darkness be as the Noon-day.</HI> And Ver. 11. <HI>The Lord shall guide the continually, and satisfy thy Soul in Drought, and make fat thy Bones: And thou shalt be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring whose Waters fail not.</HI></P>
<P>The Performance of this Duty gives us Peace and Serenity of Spirit; our State and Condition in this Life requires it; the Tempta∣tions to which we are exposed, are avoided by it.</P>
<P>And we have the Pleasure of imitating the Worthies of old; such as <HI>Moses, Daniel,</HI> and <HI>Elias;</HI> and of obeying the Command, and conforming to the Example, of our Blessed Lord and Saviour.</P>
<P>And every good Christian will, with St. <HI>Paul, keep under his Body, have it in Subjection: For they that are Christ's, have crucified the Flesh, with its Affections and Lusts.</HI></P>
<P>And then it is as sure, that those are none of Christ's, who have not crucified the Flesh.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<P>Nor can they have any comfortable Hope, that they shall one Day be owned by him, that could not, for his sake, fast sometimes, who for theirs led a Life of Mortifications, was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</P>
<P>It is true, that he sometimes went to Festi∣vals: But, even there, he was exactly tempe∣rate; and taught us to use this World, as not abusing it; and left his great Example for our Imitation.</P>
<P>It would be arrogant Profaneness in us to pretend to be able to imitate him in his Forty Days Fast; for that was the Effect of his Power, and as true a Miracle as any that he wrought.</P>
<P>But yet, so far as our Natures will allow us, we should be temperate in our Meats and Drinks; and, if we resolve never to deny our∣selves, our Sentence is read in those terrible Words of St. <HI>Paul, Romans</HI> viii. 6.</P>
<P><HI>To be carnally minded is Death;</HI> that is, To indulge our brutish Sensuality, to mind and study the Flesh, will dreadfully expose us to eternal Misery.</P>
<P>We should never make a God of our Belly, by devoting our Study, our Time, our Estates, to please it,</P>
<P>The Sum of what I have said, amounts to This.</P>
<P>Our Fasts humble and afflict our Souls; they prepare and qualify us for higher, and nobler, and more refined Satisfactions.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
<P>They promote the Ardors of Devotion, and tend to produce many excellent Graces in us.</P>
<P>Therefore let us turn unto God, with all our Heart, with Fastings and Mortifications.</P>
<P>For those shall enable us to carry on that blessed End, and assist us in <HI>turning unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>And give me Leave to enforce and drive this Home upon you, by all those weighty Consi∣derations, that use to affect either Men or Chris∣tians.</P>
<P>For if Gratitude can have any Power over us (and 'tis most apt to work upon ingenuous Minds);</P>
<P>I beseech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, by the Riches of his Goodness (<HI>by his Patience, Forbearance, and Long — Suffering, towards us miserable Sinners), that you present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto him; that you would glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are God's.</HI></P>
<P>For this is one of the Inferences that the Apostle draws from the Benefits that we have received; <HI>You are bought with a Brice; there∣fore glorisy God.</HI></P>
<P>If the Importunity of God himself can chal∣lenge any Regard, how oft are we invited! How importunately are we solicited! How ear∣nestly are we courted, <HI>to turn unto our God!</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>we will hear the Prophets;</HI> this was their main Errand, to engage Men to turn from all their Transgressions; so that Iniquity might not be their Ruin: <HI>Turn ye, turn ye; Why will ye die! Why will you break through all these
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>Obligations, and madly chuse your own De∣struction?</HI></P>
<P>The Gospel is the Ministry of Reconcilia∣tion, and the Publishers of it were Embassa∣dors of Heaven, and used all their earnest Endeavours <HI>to turn Men from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Necessity can excite our Industry</HI> (and it uses in other Cases to be a strong and powerful Argument), Why do we not turn to God with all our Hearts? since we must either do it, or it had been good for us, that we had not been born; that we had never seen the Light, nor known what it is to breathe in this World.</P>
<P>There is an indispensable Necessity of turning unto God, as we ever hope to live with him; and most Men are so feelingly convinced of this, that they do not expect a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Pa∣radise beyond the Grave; nor believe that their Lusts and Vices shall admit them to the Glories of a heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>But here is the great Deceitfulness of Sin; Men that are once engaged in wicked Courses, put the evil Day far from them; they hope to repent, and turn unto God in the Time of their Sickness, or in their old Age: By which they grant 'tis necessary to be done; tho' at present they have no Inclination <HI>to turn unto their God.</HI></P>
<P>But is any Man assured, that he shall be sick before he dies? Or, if he be, that he shall have the Use of his Understanding, and his Memory?</P>
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
<P>Does not the settling of our temporal Af∣fairs often devour all the Intervals of our Time, all the little Cessations from Pain? And when we are restless and uneasy, and full of Tossings unto the Dawning of the Day; when we wish in the Morning, Would God it were Evening! and in the Evening, Would God it were Morning! when we are equally weary of the chearful Light, and the melancholy Darkness;</P>
<P>When our Friends cannot give us any Re∣spite, and we are only solicitous for an easier Posture;</P>
<P>When our Fancies are full of strange incon∣sistent Ramblings, and our sickly Dreams are nothing but a wild Heap of confused Images;</P>
<P>Are we then fit to repent, when we are un∣able to think? And can we turn unto God, when we cannot recollect our Sins, and want an Head to set in Order before us the Things that we have done.</P>
<P>Or, if we could, are we assured, that he would accept our late-intended Repentance? For tho' he hath promised Remission to all that repent; yet he has no-where promised the Grace of Repentance to those that defer it to such an Hour.</P>
<P>Nor is old Age a proper Season for that which requires the Vigour of our Faculties; and few reach to that; or, if they do, they still flatter themselves with living longer; and tho' they are aged, yet they would be older before they repent.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
<P>Besides, that Age is generally attended with so many Infirmities, that the Man is a kind of a living Hospital: He can groan and sigh, and weary both himself, and others, with Com∣plaints: But his Faculties are dull and heavy; they are weak and feeble; the Staff, and the Couch, bring the Man to Childhood again; and he is helpless, in extreme old Age, as those that are only beginning to live.</P>
<P>If our own most solemn Vows and Obliga∣tions can be powerful enough to hold us to this Duty; Did not our Baptismal Engagement tie us to renounce the World, the Flesh, and the Devil? And what is this, <HI>but to turn unto God?</HI> Did not our Sacramental Promises oblige us to amend our Lives, to change our vicious Habits? And did we not use this Day a so∣lemn Prayer? <Q>Turn thou us, O Lord, and “so shall we be turned: Be favourable, be fa∣vourable, to thy People, that turn unto thee, ”with Weeping, Fasting, and Praying.</Q></P>
<P>Either we were in Earnest, or we were not, when we thus spoke with our Lips; and he that is not serious at his Prayers, adds the base and vile Sin of Hypocrisy to his other heinous Guilt: And he that will dissemble with his God, that searches his Heart, knows his Spirit, and understands the most retired Motions of his Soul, is in a desperate Condition: <HI>Ne Salus quidem ipsa servare potest.</HI></P>
<P>Salvation itself cannot save the Man, that has Impudence enough to dissemble with him that made him: There is not (neither indeed
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>can be) a more heinous Wickedness than Hy∣pocrisy.</P>
<P>If Interest (which uses to move the whole World) can have any good Effect upon us; then we are sure, that if we, through the Spi∣rit, do mortify the Deeds of the Flesh, we shall live. If we, that have wasted our Goods, will return; if we will arise, and go to our Father; he stands ready, with open Arms, to receive us.</P>
<P><HI>If Danger can rouse and awaken a lethargic Soul;</HI> there is a Place of Torment for a <HI>Dives;</HI> where he must not only want his Purple, and fine Linen, his sparkling Wines, and his luxu∣rious Diet (his fawning Parasites, and his lewd Companions); but, instead of these, he is condemned to the most exquisite Pains; and he that swam in Plenty, cries out to <HI>Abraham, —Send</HI> Lazarus, <HI>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue; for I am tormented in these Flames.</HI></P>
<P>Let us, then, ask ourselves the Prophet's Question; <HI>Who amongst us can live with the devouring Flames? Who can dwell with ever∣lasting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P>Let us take the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s Advice; <HI>Consider this, and shew yourselves Men: Bring it again to Mind, O! ye Transgressors: Act like Creatures endued with Reason and Under∣standing.</HI></P>
<P>And let us embrace the wise Counsel of the Son of <HI>Sirach: Say not</HI> (says he) <HI>that God's Mercy is great, and he will be pacified for the
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>Multitude of my Sins; for Mercy and Wrath come from him; and his Indignation rests upon Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Make then no tarrying, to turn unto the Lord, and put not off from Day to Day; for suddenly shall the Wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy Security thou shalt be de∣stroyed, and perish in the Day of Vengeance.</P>
<P>God, of his infinite Mercy, give us Grace, with all the Powers of our Minds, to <HI>turn unto him,</HI> and seriously to consider the Things that belong to our Peace; and enable us to subdue our Lusts, and conquer ourselves! So, we may humbly hope to be victorious over all our Enemies abroad, and soon have the Blessing of an honourable and lasting Peace.</P>
<P>I shall shut up all, in the Words of our Holy Mother, the Church.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, who for our sake didst fast Forty Days and Forty Nights; Give us Grace to use such Abstinence, that our Flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey thy godly Motions, in Righteousness and true Holiness, to thy Honour and Glory, who livest and reignest with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, World without End.</HI> Amen.</P>
