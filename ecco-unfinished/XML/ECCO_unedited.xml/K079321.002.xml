<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">RAPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE crime of Rape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII.</NOTE> like that of Murder, is one of the
Four Pleas of the Crown, and is justly classed with it
in many of our statutes, as one of the most grievous injuries
that an individual can sustain: being a robbery of that
wherein a woman's honour, her place in society, and her
estimation in her own eyes, depend; and being also, in
the perpetration of it, necessarily accompanied with great
alarm and terror, and with actual violence to the per∣son.</P>
<P>Two controversies have subsisted among the commenta∣tors
on the Roman law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Crimen Raptus,</HI> what it was in the Roman law.</NOTE> touching the doctrine of that system
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
with respect to this offence. According to some<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is the opinion of Mathaeus, Perezius, and of Carpsovius.</NOTE>, who at
least allege very plausible, though perhaps not conclusive
reasons for their opinion, the <HI>crimen raptus</HI> consisted in the
forcible abduction of the woman's person, and was a com∣plete
and capital crime, though violation did not ensue.
And farther, which is not very suitable in itself, and would
need to be confirmed by fuller authorities than any that are
quoted for it, the violation, without abduction of her person,
was not only a different crime, distingushed by the name of
<HI>stuprum violentum,</HI> but was only punishable, in any case, with
the pain of deportation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See these questions discussed in Carpsovins, Corn. in Dig. lib. 48. tit. 4.
p. 450. 451 452 who is of opinion, that either the rape or the abduction was
<HI>separat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> capital.</NOTE></P>
<P>HOWEVER these things might be in the Roman law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is in the Scots law.</NOTE> cer∣tain
it is, that the custom of Scotland, which in this is
equally agreeable to reason and to the practice of the rest
of Europe, does not listen to any such distinction, and holds
the crime of rape to be complete, without any abduction, by
the unlawful carnal knowledge of the woman's person, for∣cibly,
and against her will. If there were need of authori∣ties
on this head, reference might be made to the case of
Captain Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 8. &amp; 22. 1697.</NOTE> and to that of Wallace and Ferres; in both
of which this alleged doctrine of the Roman law was urged,
and was disregarded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. and Mar. 2. 1747.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penetration and Emission, if ne∣cessary.</NOTE> therefore, are the facts which are necessary to be
proved on a charge of rape. I. There must be carnal know∣ledge
of the woman's person, by penetration of her privy
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
parts, or entry of her body.<NOTE PLACE="marg">RAPE.</NOTE> But whether emission is also
necessary; or whether a distinction is to be admitted in this
article between women of mature age, and those under the
years of puberty, (which seems to be the opinion of Carpsovius
and Mathaeus), is a question which I shall rather leave to be
decided on the terms of certain convictions which appear in
the record, than endeavour to settle by offering any remarks
of my own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. &amp; 9. 1642.</NOTE> Alexander Gylour, “servant in the Bass, and
“clymer of the craig thereof,” is indicted for the filthy
crime of forcing, violent abusing, and deflouring of Janet
Boussie; and the assize convict him “of the violent and
schameful forceing of the said Janet Boussie, ane young vir∣gine,
not past ten yearis of adge, renting and ryveing of
hir in hir secret partis, to the effusione of hir blood in
great quantitie; with this declaratione, that they could
not find nor affirme, that ye said Alexander Gylour had sic∣carnall
copulatione with the said young lasse, as ane man
has with ane woman, in respect of her young yearis and
minoritie above writtin.” On which verdict he has sen∣tence
to be scourged, and to be delivered to an officer on fo∣reign
service, who shall carry him abroad, to serve as a soldier
in the foreign wars. This sentence is not given till after
consultation with the Privy Council, and is milder than that
which follows in other three cases, where the facts set forth
in the dittay and verdict do not seem to be materially different.
On the 3d of July 1605, William Bell has sentence of death
for the forcing and abusing of Janet Falconar, “scho being
ane young maid of twelf yeiris of age or y<SUP>rby</SUP>, and ryveing
of hir thairthro'w, and causing hir to bleid at hir previe
membiris in greit abundance.” On the 30th December
1608, John Errol has sentence of death for ravishing “Janet
Craig, dochter of umquhil Andrew Craig, merchand-bur∣gess
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of Edinburgh, ane honist manis bairne, and ane young
virgine nocht past the age of elivin yeiris.” The libel
relates the pannel's various attempts to decoy the infant
to his purpose, by means of allurements suited to her age;
and that at length he carried her (she having passed with
him “upon bairnelines and meire simplicitie”), to a con∣venient
place, “quair ye, againis the bairne's will, tuik
up her claithis, and maist filthilie forcit yourself to half
ado with hir, and wald nocht part from hir, quill ye gat
your beistlie will satisfyit, and was within hir body.”
Henry Speedy has the like doom, (20th February 1639),
on a charge of the “filthie, detestabill and abominabill
cryme of forceing, defloreing and abuseing of Agnes
Stewart, ane young virgine, and infant bairne of sex yeir
auld,” and this “be ryveing hir secreit pairtis in maist
pitifull maner, to the effusioun of hir bluid, and greit
dainger of hir lyfe.”<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There was a report of surgeons in this case, which, after relating the condi∣tion
of the child's person, concludes thus, <HI>“Et haec censemus esse vera indicin lae∣sae virg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitatis.”</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>2. THE knowledge of the woman's person must be against
her will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carnal Know∣ledge must be Forcible.</NOTE> and by force. So that though she be carried off by
violence at first, and even be detained in some measure in a
state of confinement and constraint; yet, if in the end, be∣ing
weakened-in mind, and shaken with continual solicitation
and other means, she submit to the embraces of her compa∣nion
without any use of threats or violence, either at the
time, or recently before; this is not a rape, but a crime of
a different, though perhaps still more base and infamous de∣scription.
The resistance, therefore, must be continued to
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the last; so that it is only by main force and terror that the
violation is accomplished. Probably it was on this ground
that the jury acquitted of that part of the charge in the
case of James Macgregor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60.</NOTE> while they found him guilty of
the hamesucken and forcible abduction.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine must,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is held forcible Know∣ledge.</NOTE> however, always be understood in a
reasonable and consistent sense. For it is no less obvious, that
it is no consent, to take away the guilt of rape, if the woman
only discontinue her resistance out of fear of death, as when
a pistol is clapped to her head, or a dagger to her breast; or
if she be threatened with destruction, and be beaten and
abused in such a manner, as to alarm her for the safety of
her life. There is the same reason for holding this to be
a rape, that there is for holding it to be a robbery, if a
person, on the like demand, submits to have his money ta∣ken
out of his pocket, or even with his own hands deli∣vers
it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel against William and Alexander Frasers, for forcible abduction and
rape, related, that the pannels carried Jean Fiaser out of her house in Inverness
into the county called Stratherick, “where she was detained in captivity for
several days and nights, and carried from place to place, and thereby, <HI>and by
the terror of her life compelled</HI> to submit to the said William Fraser his unlaw∣ful
purposes.” This libel was found relevant to infer the pains of law. The
diet was afterwards deserted. November 14. and 23. 1744▪</NOTE> Or what if the woman faint in the struggle
through terror and fatigue, and is in that state carnally
known; or if from natural infirmity she is unable to oppose,
otherwise than by her intreaties, and her cries for assistance?
In either case the deed is accomplished by violence, since
all the resistance is made that nature will allow. This is
exemplified in the case of James Mackie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 20. 1650.</NOTE> who was con∣demned
to die “for the shameful deflouring, forcing and
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
abusing of Margaret Coltran in Wester Wamphray, a poor
cripple lame lass of sixteen years old, lying bedfast in her
father's house, and unable to make any resistance,” he
having entered the house on a Sunday, at a time when she
was there alone.</P>
<P>IT may be thought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is held forcible know∣ledge.</NOTE> that the same judgment shall even be
applied to the case of her who has been overpowered and
stupified, or laid asleep, by the foul contrivance of drugs or
potions administered to her, and is abused in this state of
insensibility. For this is as great a violence to her person
and constitution, as if she were bound with cords, or stun∣ned
with blows before the fact, or were in any other ma∣sterful
way disabled to resist. The precise case has not in∣deed
been tried; though there is a noted one which comes
near it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 21. 1721.</NOTE> the case of Campbel of Burnbank, which is else∣where
taken notice of<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Falsehood, p. 245.</NOTE>, and may be seeen at large in the
appendix to Maclaurin's Cases.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 738.</NOTE> But the woman in that in∣stance
was dead before the trial; and the libel did not
affirm that her person had been violated<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And showed them the said Margaret Hall in her naked bed, and a man
with her, not her husband, who villainously in their sight either was de∣bauching
her, or endeavouring to persuade them he was doing so, by the
posture he was in and the motions he made.”</NOTE> (as neither had
she herself affirmed it in her lifetime), but only that either
it was so, <HI>or</HI> so was made to appear to the byestanders.
The charge could not therefore be found relevant, as for
the proper pains of rape.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
THE quality of forcible knowledge, as now explained, is
farther to be understood as only necessary in the case of
persons adult.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Force neces∣sary in the vio∣lation of Pupils?</NOTE> In the case of infants, and females under
the years of puberty, there is only a constructive force, or
force in the estimation of law; which is taken upon this rea∣sonable
ground, that because of her simplicity, and defect,
as well of intelligence and discretion, as of passion, the fe∣male,
at those years, is incapable of a due consent to this
act, and cannot, in any proper sense, be said to have a will
in the matter; so that the deed may justly be said to be
without her will, even where she makes no resistance. On
that account, and as the wickedness of the offender is even
greater in this depraved abuse of an ignorant child; so, both
the style of the crime, and the pains of law, have always
been the same for it, as in the case of force employed against
a woman of mature discretion. Four instances of capital
conviction in this sort have already been mentioned: and
to these may be added two more;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 1693.</NOTE> the case of William Currie,
for rape committed on Elizabeth Guthrie, a child of nine
years old; and the case of William Riply, convicted at In∣verness,
of a rape on Elizabeth Grinsal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 11. 1761.</NOTE> a child under six
years of age. This case was reported by the Judge upon
the circuit, for the opinion of all his brethren; who, on deli∣berate
consideration, “found, that the crime of which the
foresaid William Riply stands convicted is capital,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23. &amp; 27. 1761.</NOTE> and
adjudged him to be executed accordingly.</P>
<P>3. As the crime of rape is thus independent of the age of
the female,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can Rape be done on a Prosti∣tute?</NOTE> so is it also independent of her situation, be she
maid, wife, or widow, and even of her character and way of
life, though it were that of a strumpet, “<HI>quae passim formam
venalem exhibuit.</HI>” Any other opinion, can only proceed
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
on the notion of sustaining this course of life as an irrefra∣gable
presumption in law, that the act was not done against
her will. And certainly it is <HI>prima facie</HI> an evidence of
assent in any case, that the woman is one of this condition;
and it will require to be overcome by very clear proof, on
her part, of her violent and continued resistance of the at∣tempt.
But if once the full evidence be obtained, that
the woman was truly known by main force, “<HI>vi compressa
contra pacem domini regis;”</HI> as for instance, if she be at
once knocked down on the highway by a person who knows
her not, and is abused in that state of stupefaction; this is a
good ground of the charge of rape. For the person of this
woman, as much as that of any other of the King's subjects,
is under the safeguard of the law, if she shall choose to aban∣don
her vicious course of life; and the order and protection
of society are equally broken in this assault on her, as on any
of the more deserving members of the community. It is true,
the degree of the injury is affected by the circumstance of
her previous evil life; and so it is if the sufferer have ever
in any instance been unchaste, or of suspected fame; as it
may likewise be by other considerations of a quite different
kind. But, in disregarding this difference, the law does
no more than observe its ordinary rule, as in the case of
other offences. For, in fixing the character of any crime,
and deciding whether it has been committed, the con∣stant
course is to attend to the act itself, and never to the
person; to consider the immediate and fundamental thing
that has been done,—the violation of order, peace, or securi∣ty,—and
to pay no regard to the merits of the sufferer, nor
attempt to trace the precise degree of evil which follows it
in the particular case. Thus, it is <HI>robbery</HI> to take a penny
from any one by force, whether the person be a rich man or a
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
beggar. It is <HI>murder</HI> wherever a man is killed, without
respect of the condition of the deceased, whether he were
a sane person or an idiot, in health or on deathbed, an use∣ful
citizen or a criminal. And just so it is a rape, to know
a woman carnally by force, of what condition or quality
soever she be. If it is not the same high injury to the pro∣stitute,
as to the woman of virtuous deportment, it is for the
royal mercy to consider this circumstance, and to remit or
to mitigate the punishment: It is not for the Judge to distin∣guish,
as if the woman had not been forced, nor a rape been
committed. In addition to these reasons, though in them∣selves
conclusive:—any other doctrine would lead to farther,
and very injurious inquiries and distinctions.</P>
<P>4. MACKENZIE has added to his definition of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Rape be for Lust only?</NOTE>
that it is done for satisfying of the ravisher's lust; and he says
that it is not a rape if she be taken away on any other ac∣count.
But this seems to be somewhat rashly said. It is
not as a lustful, but as a malicious and injurious act; that
rape is the object of the severity of the law. And the
woman suffers the same injury, whatsoever be the ulti∣mate
end or chief incitement to the crime; whether pure
lust, (which is always thus far involved in the case, that
the rape cannot otherwise be perpetrated), or combined
with this, the motive of avarice, revenge, or other malig∣nant
passion; in which case the outrage seems only to be the
more odious and inexcusable. Of this character, and certainly
the fit ground of a charge of rape, was the case of Simon
Fraser of Beaufort, (afterwards Lord Lovat), who, partly
out of revenge for his disappoinment of his projected mar∣riage
with a certain heiress, and partly to possess himself of
a valuable jointure, committed a forcible abduction, mar∣riage,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
and rape, on the person of the lady's mother, the
Dowager Lady Lovat, who had opposed his suit. On ac∣count
of the rising in arms, with which this outrage was
accompanied, Fraser and his associates were, in the first in∣stance,
tried in absence, as for treason. But having obtain∣ed
a pardon for that crime, he was afterwards, on the
17th February 1701, outlawed on a libel for rape and hame∣sucken,
at the instance of Lady Lovat. In the case, in like
manner, of Campbell of Burnbank, if it could have been
shown that the woman was actually violated, the fact would
not the less have been a rape, in the violator and his asso∣ciates,
that it was only part of a conspiracy to ruin her
fame, and divorce her from her husband.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Rape.</NOTE> that there is equally room
for conviction as art and part on a charge of rape, as of
those crimes in which the principal matter itself may be the
deed of more than one person. Those who assist in the ab∣duction,
binding, or subduing of the person, or even by pre∣sence
or approbation of the deed, are all involved in the
same guilt as the ravisher. This will even hold without
exception of the husband of the woman; who, though he
cannot himself commit a rape on his own wife, who has
surrendered her person to him in that sort, may however be
accessory to that crime, (if one may suppose so flagitious a
case), committed on her by another. In the spring circuit
1794, at Aberdeen, three persons were condemned as art and
part of one act of rape.</P>
<P>5. THE punishment of rape is death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of law for Rape.</NOTE> by immemorial cus∣tom.
Beside other instances of this severity which have
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
already been mentioned; Wallace and Ferres had sentence
of death for rape, 3d March 1747, and Duncan Wright,
11th January 1790.</P>
<P>IN one situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If the Woman acquiesce.</NOTE> the offender's life may however be sa∣ved,
in virtue of the statute 1612, c. 4.; which assumes and
implies, (for it does not enact any such thing), that in case
the woman shall acquiesce in her condition, and declare,
though contrary to the truth, that she went off with the pan∣nel
of her own free will, he shall not be condemned to die;
saving to her kinsfolks to insist against him for arbitrary
punishment, to the extent of fine, imprisonment, or escheat of
moveables. It may be inferred from the style of the statute,
that according to the previous practice, the woman's decla∣ration
of her consent had been reckoned a complete pro∣tection
to the ravisher; and indeed there are two instances
in the record, recently before the date of the statute, where,
by appearing in Court and testifying in his favour, the wo∣man
had disappointed the course of public justice. In the
case of James Herrin, tried on the 29th June 1590, for a
rape on Agnes Blair, she compears and says, “That she
passed away with him willingly,” on which he is straight∣way
acquitted by the assize. In the trial of Andrew Dow∣nie,
on the 12th January 1590, for the ravishing of Essie
Clark, she in like manner testifies upon oath, “That she past
away but violence rapt or ravishing, whilk her said mo∣ther
verified.” The prosecutor answers, that she has been
constrained to this measure, and ought to be sequestrated in
the hands of some proper person, appointed by the Court.
But the issue is, that “in respect of the King's will and
the woman's declaration” the panuel is discharged, with∣out
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
any provision being made to enforce his appearance, in
case of his being again called on. To hinder the encourage∣ment,
which in this course was given to such attempts,
and at the same time to reconcile that object with com∣passion
to the woman, whose prospect of an advantageous
establishment in life is lessened by such a misfortune, was
probably the motive of this enactment. And, that in truth
there was at that period some need of applying a remedy
to this abuse, not only appears from the proceedings alrea∣dy
mentioned, but from a letter addressed by James VI. to
Parliament in 1609, wherein he complains of the frequency
of such outrages of late years, and, among other means of
repressing them, advises to pass an act punishing the mere
abduction with death, and declaring that the woman's ac∣quiescence
after the deed shall not abolish the guilt of rape.
The fruit of this letter was a Parliamentary commission in
1609, concerning the ravishing of women<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See the Index to the unprinted acts of 1609, No. 44.</NOTE>, and the above sta∣tute
of 1612. To serve the purpose of saving the pan∣nel's
life, the woman's declaration in his favour must how∣ever
be given in a state of entire freedom, such as not
only protects her from all immediate constraint, but also
from all fear of consequences for the future. The ne∣cessity
of this precaution appeared in the proceedings for the
abduction of Jean Key,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Machurin, No. 60.</NOTE> who being put under the protection
of a person appointed by the Court, soon recalled the re∣peated
declarations, which she had previously given in fa∣vour
of the offender, in a written, and even a judicial form.
If made freely, her testimony seems, however, by the words
of the act, to be effectual to the ravisher, though she should
not continue to cohabit with and adhere to him, as her hus∣band.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
6. THE competent prosecutors for rape are, <HI>first,</HI> the King<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was argued in the case of Thomas Dickson, August 2. 1744, that the King was only a competent prosecutor in the case of abduction as well as rape, by reason of the invasion of the liberty of a subject. This case issued in a volun∣tary banishment. John Errol had been indicted for rape, at instance of the Ad∣vocate only, as far back as the 30th December 1608.</NOTE>
as in other cases;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may pro∣secute for Rape.</NOTE> <HI>secondly,</HI> the woman herself, the party
principally injured; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> which is implied in the
statute 1612, c. 4. her kinsmen and near connections, who
are allowed to insist in her lifetime, and though she be
of perfect age; whether this be, that the crime is con∣sidered
as an injury and indignity to them also, or by
reason of the necessity of the woman's testimony as a wit∣ness,
or of the peculiar nature of the offence, which she
may be unwilling to bring before a court of justice. Thus,
the husband may pursue for rape committed on his wife, as
in the case of Colonel Charteris;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 27. April 4. and Nov. 11. &amp; 12. 1723. July 6. 1602.</NOTE> and the parent for rape
committed on the child, as in the case of James Cheyne<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In 1618, one Wedderburne is continued under caution in a pursuit for rape, at instance of the woman's mother.</NOTE>;
where it was objected that the woman was herself of perfect
age, and did not concur in the prosecution. In the case of
Caruegie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20. 1681.</NOTE> a father-in-law pursued in name of the woman,
and her mother, and for himself; to which no objection
seems to have been made. Probably, failing parents, the
interest of a brother or other near relation would be sus∣tained.
A tutor, likewise, seems to have a good title, whose
guardianship of the person is contemned and broken in the
abduction or violation of his ward.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
7. EVEN in the case of prosecution at instance of the
woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time and Form of the Com∣plaint.</NOTE> she is not now subject to the same strict limitation,
as she is said to have been of old, with respect to the time
and manner of revealing her misfortune, and making her
complaint.<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. c. 8. 10.</NOTE> Áccording to the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> which is
to the same effect with the ancient custom of England, and
of other countries, she was straightway to proceed to the next
town, and there to disclose her condition, with the natural
evidences of the violence she had sustained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Tenetur autem mulier quae tale crimen patitur, mox dum recens suerit malesicium, vicinam villam adire; et ibi probis hominibus injuriam sibi illa∣tum ostendere; et cruorem, si quis fuerit essusus, patefacere, tam in sacie quam in corpore sub vestibus, et vestium scissiones.” B. 4. ch. 8. “Et si ultra unam noctem expectaverit ad habendum concilium amicorum suo∣rum, ita quod recenter non faciat sequelam, et hoe probetur, dēfendens quie∣tus erit, et calumnians in misericordia domini regis.” Ch. 10. No. 2.</NOTE>, to the <HI>probi ho∣mines</HI>
of the town; after which she had to complain, in the
same fashion, to certain officers and magistrates of the
vicinity. If she delayed to follow this course beyond a
single night, which was allowed her “<HI>ad habendum concilium
amicorum suorum,</HI>” her complaint was no longer to be
listened to, but punishment to be inflicted on her as a ca∣lumnious
accuser.</P>
<P>THESE restraints, which might be suitable to the times
when they were introduced, have long been obsolete as well
with respect to rape, as to robbery and hamesucken, which
were once subject to the same directions. Not that any long
delay to prosecute, and still more to disclose the injury to
those who naturally should be made acquainted with it, will
not always have its due weight with a jury, as matter of
evidence in judging of the probability of the charge; but
only, that neither of these things will now be admitted <HI>in
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
limine,</HI> as a bar to the prosecution. Action was sustained in
the case of Colonel Charteris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 27. 1723.</NOTE> at the distance of a twelve∣month
after the fact;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1732</NOTE> and in that of Matthew Foulden,
which also went to trial, there had been a delay of at least
three days, (but which was accounted for in a reasonable
manner), before any disclosure of the offence.</P>
<P>8. WHERE the prosecution is not at instance of the wo∣man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party injured is a competent Witness.</NOTE>
her evidence upon oath, or, if she be under the due
age for making oath, her declaration, is admitted in the
trial; as being in the common case a necessary testimo∣ny,
without which a conviction cannot be obtained. On
the other hand; as the accusation of so secret an offence
may easily be made, and though false, is hard to be dispro∣ved
by direct evidence; so the credit to be given her testi∣mony
must depend on the probability of her story, (all cir∣cumstances
considered), and the concurrent evidence which
supports it. In the case of Matthew Foulden, the jury con∣victed
only of an assault with intent to ravish, though the
woman positively swore to the completion of a rape. And
Charles Fallon, notwithstanding evidence to the same effect,
but attended with several unlikely circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 10. 1775.</NOTE> was fully
acquitted.</P>
<P>II. THUS much of the capital crime of rape. But it will be
proper to observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Assault with Intent to ravish.</NOTE> that though the pannel have not succeeded
in the perpetration of that crime; yet if he has made a violent
and indecent assault with intent to ravish, this also, without
a doubt, is a point of dittay for which he is liable to be
punished, not only with fine and damages, but with corpo∣ral
and infamous pains: Both on account of the high alarm
and terror which accompany an assault in that sort, and
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
because of the present injury and indignity of such an at∣tempt
on the person of a modest woman. In the case of
James Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. and Nov. 22. 1703.</NOTE> libel was found relevant to infer an arbitra∣ry
pain, which bore a charge, that “most unnaturally and
villanously he did abuse the body of the said Isobel
Cleugh, (a poor child, six years of age), by lying above
her, and offering to lie, or actually lying carnally with
her.” Colonel Charteris being convicted of an attempt
to ravish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. 1723.</NOTE> was decerned in L. 300 of damages and costs<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The jury finds it proven, that the pannel was seen lying above Janet Wil∣son, the woman mentioned in the libel; as also, finds it proven, that while they were on the ground together, the said Janet Wilson was heard to cry out.”</NOTE>.
On the 22d June 1732, in pursuance of the like conviction<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The jury all in one voice, found it proved “time and place libelled, that the pannel Matthew Foulden, was lying above the person of Agnes Donald∣son, upon the ground, with her nakedness discovered, meanwhile she was crying.” June 20.</NOTE>,
Matthew Foulden was adjudged to be scourged, and to be ba∣nished
from the town of Jedburgh. And on the circuit at that
burgh in April 1791, William Newton, for the like offence,
was adjudged to be scourged, and to pay a fine of L. 20.</P>
<P>III. THE practice of Scotland is attentive to guard the
honour of the female sex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corruption of the Morals of Female Pupils.</NOTE> not only against those forcible at∣tempts,
which may be made upon them in their mature age,
but also against those still more infamous and abominable
practices, and which it were a violation of decency to de∣scribe,
which may be made to corrupt and vitiate their
minds, in their earlier years, before they have attained to
sufficient intelligence or discretion, for their own defence
against such seduction. The libel against James Forbes,
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
master of a charity-school, bore a charge of practices of this
nature, as well as of rape, and carnal knowledge of girls
under twelve years of age. On the 24th July 1758, the
Court found “the said indictment, and <HI>different articles thereof
jointly and severally relevant,</HI> to infer the pains of law;” and
being found guilty, he was ordered to be scourged, and to
be transported for life. On a libel, bearing accusation of
the like indecencies against John Bell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 2. 1777.</NOTE> schoolmaster at
Stewarton, the diet was deserted in respect of an inaccu∣racy
in the charge; but the Court thought it proper, never∣theless,
to record their opinion of the dittay, as “contain∣ing
matter highly criminal, and dangerous to society, and
relevant to infer the pains of law.” On the 15th August
1789, William Wood was outlawed on a charge of the same
kind.</P>
<P>IV. THE only other offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of forcible Ali∣duction and Marriage.</NOTE> which peculiarly concerns
the female part of the inhabitants of Scotland, is that of
forcible abduction and marriage. This, as already said,
is alleged to have been the proper <HI>crimen raptus</HI> of the Ro∣man
law, and to have been punished with death, even though
it were not attended with violation of the woman's per∣son.
There is not, perhaps, the full measure of authority
for this opinion; though truly, if we consider the alarm and
terror of such an attack on the person of a woman, and
the desolation and misery of a state of continued captivi∣ty
in the hands of ruffians, (not to mention the humilia∣tion
and loss of peace which attend such a misfortune), it
may well seem that lower injuries, and such as do not imply
the same height of boldness and profligacy in the offender,
are, by the laws of most nations, punished with death. It
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
cannot however be assirmed of the ancient custom of Scotland,
that it had adopted this opinion; whether the reason be that
such attempts were rare, or that the abduction was ordinarily
accompanied with rape, which could not be the less criminal,
that it took place under the pretence of marriage. The only
charge of such a crime which I have found in the older re∣cords,
is that against Patrick Carnegie, son to Lord Northesk,
for abduction of Mary Gray, the heiress of Baledgarno; which,
according to the story related in the libel, was attended with
circumstances of great violence and ferocity. But, after many
continuations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 21. 1681.</NOTE> the diet was in the end deserted; owing to a
pardon obtained from the King, as far as the public interest
was concerned. Hence, when the question came to be
agitated more lately, in the trial of Thomas Gray and
others, in 1751, for the forcible abduction and marriage of
Jacobina Moir, an heiress of fifteen years of age, it was
reckoned in a manner a new question, and was the subject of
a full argument at the bar. The result was, that the libel was
found only relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and
that Gray and his two accomplices were adjudged to be
transported for fourteen years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 59.</NOTE> It is true, that the abduc∣tion
in that case was neither to a great distance, nor for a
length of time; as well as that the enterprise was conducted
by means of artifice and fraud, rather than by main force. It
is also true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 62.</NOTE> that in the later case of Robert Macgregor, con∣victed
as art and part of the abduction of Jean Key, ca∣pital
sentence was pronounced, and carried into execution.
But this judgment was given on the special and aggravated
ground of the abduction being coupled to hamesucken, by
invasion of the woman in her own house, and the forcible car∣rying
of her person thence. James Macgregor, the bro∣ther
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
of this Robert, and principal actor in this atroci∣ous
injury, had also been previously convicted by a ver∣dict,
upon which a debate ensued, whether it amounted to
a conviction of hamesucken;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60.</NOTE> but he withdrew himself
from the risk, and prevented the decision, by making his
escape from goal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HAMESUCKEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE only other article in our list of capital offences
against the person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII.</NOTE> is Hamesucken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Hamesucken.</NOTE> or “the felonious
seeking and invasion of a person in his dwelling-place or
house.” Notice is taken of this crime, and the same descrip∣tion
is given of it, in the laws of the Visigoths, and in
those of Edmund, the Anglo-Saxon King, and of Canute
the Dane: It seems too to have been known under that
name, and as a capital offence, in the law of Utrecht<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Mathaeus de vi publica et privata, ch. 4.</NOTE>,
and of some other states of modern times. Our oldest me∣morial
concerning it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. ch. 9. 10.</NOTE> is in the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI> which di∣rects
the prosecution of it to be followed out in like manner
as that of rape and robbery; as indeed, in its own nature, it
far exceeds the guilt of an ordinary assault, and is a crime
of that bold and heinous character, which makes it a fit
companion of those high transgressions. For nothing can
well be attended with greater terror and alarm, or more
break in upon a person's peace, and opinion of security
for the future, than the sudden irruption and attack of a
ruffian in that place which is most peculiarly a man's own,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
and which the law has carefully fenced for him, as his
sanctuary and surest refuge, from all manner of harm. It is
true, it may not be so necessary now, as in more undisci∣plined
times, to punish the transgression in every instance
to the utmost extent of what the prosecutor may insist for;
yet still the crime retains that rank as a point of dittay,
which ancient custom has assigned it, (for it rests on custom
only), and in any case of extreme or atrocious injury, would
be warrantably punished with the highest pains of law.</P>
<P>1. THE prime circumstance in the description of hame∣sucken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion must be in a Dwell∣ing-house.</NOTE>
is the violation of the security of a person's home.
And herein we exclude every place of reception, or accom∣modation,
though belonging to a man in property, if it is
not, in the common sense of the word, a mansion-house, or
place of habitation. Hamesucken cannot therefore be com∣mitted
in a booth, shop, or warehouse; as was determined
in the case of John Kirkwoood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. &amp; 12. 1678.</NOTE> indicted for entering the
shop of his neighbour Janet Rankine, and violently beat∣ing
her there. After debate, the prosecutor declared,
that he did not insist on the hamesucken as such, to the in∣ferring
of death, but as an aggravation only of the assault.
The Court, however, would not accept of this concession,
and thought it proper expressly to decide the question<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords, &amp;c. sustain the libel to infer a riot, but refuse to sustain the same to infer hamesucken; and find the pannels entering the pursuer's booth an aggravating circumstance; and remits,” &amp;c.</NOTE>;
which they did against the relevancy of the charge. To
the same purpose, may be quoted the decision in the case
of Mungo Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 4. 1669.</NOTE> indicted at instance of Thomas Syd∣serf,
comedian, for violently entering his theatre, or co∣medy-house
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
(as the record calls it), and there beating him
with a baton, and thrusting at him with a sword, during
the rehearsal of a play. Now the Court did not sustain this
charge as for hamesucken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It is not absolutely clear, on the terms of the libel, whether it was meant as a charge of hamesucken, or only of assault aggravated by being done in the way of hamesucken; which at that time was a common way of restricting the charge.</NOTE>, but “relevant to be ane crime,
and ryott of ane high nature, if proven;” and on convic∣tion
to the full extent of the charge, the sentence was
only to ask the pursuer's pardon, and find caution to keep the
peace: such was the estimation of a comedian in those days.
According to the same principle which ruled in these cases;
if a miller is assaulted in his mill, a cobler in his stall or
place of work, a banker in his counting-house, a clerk of
court or other officer in his office, this is not hamesucken,
but a heinous assault only. The reason lies in the nature
and destination of the place, which is not a place of pri∣vacy
and retirement, where the occupier must deem him∣self
secure against the projects of his enemies, but in some
measure a place of open resort and free access to all comers,
where any one has opportunity to find and invade him. In
which point of view, it may seem that no distinction can
well be made in this matter, at least with respect to assaults
committed in the day-time, whether the shop be or be not
a part of or adjoining to the person's dwelling-house: be∣cause
the shop is open to all the world, and ought, there∣fore,
with respect to this question, to be received as a di∣stinct
tenement from the rest of the house.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
IT does not, however, make hamesucken, that the assault
is committed in a mansion-house;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Person must be assaulted at his Home.</NOTE> unless it also be the par∣ty's
proper home, his domicil, or settled place of dwelling,
<HI>“ubi calumnians est manens, surgens et cubitans, die ac nocte.”</HI> For
under the roof of a stranger, he cannot have the same full
assurance of safety and protection, as with his own family
and household. An inn, therefore, or a tavern, is not such
a place wherein hamesucken can be committed on a guest
or passenger; and the same may even be held of a hi∣red
chamber, which a person transiently occupies for a few
days, when abroad from his proper home. This was de∣termined
with respect to a lodger at an inn, in the case
of Peter Leith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1686.</NOTE> which too was thus far more unfavourable
to the pannel than an ordinary case, that the inn was the
lodger's own property, and that a particular chamber of
it was kept for him, when he should choose to come there;
and in this chamber he was fired at and wounded<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Also, having considered the libel and debate, anent the hamesucken, they find the libel, as to the hamesucken, not relevant, not being libelled in the terms of the law.” “The Lords find that part of the libel, anent invading, blooding and wound∣ing of the defunct, relevant, <HI>per se,</HI> to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>. In the
case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 18. 1691.</NOTE> also, of the Master of Tarbat and others, the same was
found with respect to a violent assault made on certain per∣sons,
troopers in the King's guards, in the bed-chamber of
a tavern, where they were quartered<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find the pannels entering into George Poiset's chamber, and beating and blooding of him, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
ON the other side; if the place where a person is assaulted
be his dwelling-place and proper home,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">What is a Perton's home in his question?</NOTE> it is immaterial
whether the house be his own property, or only hired from
another, or even from the invader himself, being owner of
the tenement; for it is the house and exclusive possession of
the tenant, for his term. And on this head, there is a prece∣dent,
in the case of Keith of Lentush,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11. 1692.</NOTE> where the inter∣locutor
given by the Court on such a plea, requires not
the property only, but the possession also, to have been in
the pannel at the time<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind the libel relevant, <HI>quoad</HI> the crime of hamesucken, but sustaine that defence, that the said defunct, and his wife and bairnes entered to the posses∣sion of that house, only upon the occasion of their own houses being lately be∣fore brunt, and that the pannels entered the said house, in order to the execution of the foresaid caption, for protecting them against the hazard from the resis∣ters in the mansion-house, and <HI>that both the property and possession of the said house belonged,</HI> by a disposition and instrument of possession, to Lentush himself, all relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to elide the libel as to the crime of hamesucken.” In this case, however, where the natural possession in the person invaded seems to have been precarious and transient, a mere instrument of possession, with a tide in the pannel, seems to have been held sufficient; which certainly would not be true as to a tenant.</NOTE>. Likewise, it is settled, that the
house affords this high protection, not only to the master of
the family, but to his wife, children, and servants, and in gene∣ral
to all the members of his household, who are there at bed
and board; so that under his roof they have their home and
biding-place, and deem themselves secure from harm. Camp∣bell
and Mackinnon were accordingly executed in June 1725,
on a sentence of the Sheriff of Invernessshire, which pro∣ceeded
on a charge of hamesucken against them, as having
violently, and with arms, broken into the house of Fraser of
Fopachy, and there beaten and wounded his servants<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This sentence was complained of, by bill of suspension, to the Lords of Justi∣ciary. But at that period the proceedings on such bills did not regularly enter the record. The fact is mentioned on authority of the informations in the case of James Maegregor in 1752, which agree that the Sheriff's sentence <HI>was executed.</HI></NOTE>. The
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
like judgment in the case of George Johnston in 1754, where
the assault was on a lodger with the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 65.</NOTE> who had dwelt
there for some months, as an inmate of the house, and
did not appear to have any other home.</P>
<P>ONE situation there is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Inn∣keeper assaulted in his Inn.</NOTE> with regard to which, though the suf∣ferer
be master of the house, there has however been some con∣troversy,
how far he has the same protection under his own
roof as another man; I mean the situation of an innkeeper.
According to Mackenzie, this point was settled in the negative,
in the case of Muir of Pennyglen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. 1675.</NOTE> but in this he has mistaken
the interlocutor, which expressly waves any decision on that
part of the debate<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords, in regard of the pursuer's declaration, that he insists not for hamesucken, <HI>tanquam crimen separatum;</HI> but as an aggravating quality of the other crimes libelled, do forbear to give answer to the particular points of the debate relating to hamesucken.”</NOTE>. In itself, the question seems fit to be re∣solved
by certain distinctions. If a guest or lodger, being in
an inn, should quarrel with the landlord and beat him; this,
though it were even done deliberately, and in the landlord's
private room, is not hamesucken; because the offender
is already lawfully in the house, and has not gone to seek
the landlord there, to beat him. Farther; if persons are
in an inn drinking, and set upon the innkeeper in so sudden
and unprovoked a manner as shows that they truly came
there for no other purpose; it may seem that still they
are not guilty of hamesucken, (though certainly they are
guilty of an aggravated assault), by reason of the nature
of his trade and sort of house; which is not shut, like
a private house, against all but persons known to the
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
master, but is rather open, like a shop, to all comers and cus∣tomers,
and cannot be trusted to as “<HI>tutissimum refugium et
receptaculum.</HI>” The truth is, that with respect to any per∣son
whom he has admitted into the inn, the master does
not trust to the protection of the house, but to the faith of
the individual. The libel is therefore laid as for an aggra∣vated
riot only and assault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. &amp; 15. 1726.</NOTE> in the case of John Torrence and
William Baillie, which is of this precise description; be∣ing
the invasion of a publican, by persons who came to his
house armed, late in the night, and joined and drank with a
party who were previously in the house, and on the depar∣ture
of those strangers, called the master into another room,
where they instantly invaded and beat him. Indeed the pur∣suer,
in his information, yields the general point, that to
invade a publican, <HI>being already in his house,</HI> will not justify
any higher charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And as to the second, it was admitted, that hamesucken was not proper∣ly committed in a public-house; and therefore hamesucken was not libelled as the specific crime. But then as an inn-keeper was entitled to security in his own house, and as an invasion by the guests upon their landlord, was a breach of the laws of hospitality; so it was a great aggravation of the crime, and it was libelled as such.” <HI>Pursuer's information.</HI></NOTE> But there seems to be much greater
difficulty of going farther, and admitting the exception
of even a violent entry of the inn in the night, to beat the
innkeeper, as by forcing the window of his bed-chamber,
or the like. For, with respect to this season and sort of
entry, his house seems to be just the same safeguard to him,
as in the case of any other man. Accordingly, the petition
of Bernard Clunes for bail in such a case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 15. 1733.</NOTE> appears to have
been refused.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
UPON this article, of the <HI>place where</HI> hamesucken may be
committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are the Pre∣cincts Part of the House?</NOTE> there arises a question concerning the construction
of the term <HI>House,</HI> whether it only applies to the very mansion∣house,
or takes in also the precincts, or adjoining appendages
of building which are within the inclosure of the court∣yard.
Mackenzie inclines to the more enlarged construction:
Skene too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. c. 9.</NOTE> in his note on the <HI>Regiam,</HI> says, “<HI>Punitur enim hac
lege, qui facit insultum juxta domum.</HI>” As also it may be re∣marked,
in confirmation of this opinion, that by the ordinary
style of libel for hamesucken in the last century, the crime was
described in the outset of the libel, as consisting “in the
searching or seeking for a person, <HI>in, or about, his house.</HI>” Ne∣vertheless,
the sounder opinion seems to be for restricting this
capital offence to that sort of invasion, by the actual breaking
of the safeguard of the mansion-house, which marks the re∣solute
and contemptuous spirit of the offender. For though
he even come to the house with a purpose to invade; it is an
equitable, and not unlikely construction, that but for the op∣portunity
of finding the person abroad, and unprotected, he
might not venture to execute his intention. The case of
Thomas Crombie in 1638, which is quoted by Mackenzie on
the other side, truly is not a precedent upon the matter; be∣cause
the pannel was indicted, not for hamesucken only, but
for treason, as having struck within the precincts of a royal
palace, and for aught that appears may have been convicted on
that ground. In later times, two judgments have been given,
which are favourable to the milder construction. On the 4th of
March 1695, libel was raised against James Balfour, Patrick
Wood and others, which relates, that Balfour “came to the
house of Sir John Hay with a design to kill him, and having
sent John Martin his servant to inquire for him, and ha∣ving
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
spied him at his barn, upon which they came up to
him, and he civilly invited them to his house to take a
drink, and as they were going to enter the gate, the said
Mr James Balfour, designing to murder the complainer
before he should get into his house, he drew his sword and
made several thrusts.” This was charged as hamesucken,
and the case of Crombie was insisted on in the debate; but
without effect with the Court, who found the charge only
relevant as an invasion, to infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">March 6. 1695. “Finds the libel not relevant to infer hamesucken; but find the invasion libelled relevant against Mr James Balfour to infer an ar∣bitrary punishment.”</NOTE>
The other case is that of David Hume, in October 1723,
where the assault was charged as hamesucken, being com∣mitted
within the close or court-yard of the house of Seaton;
which (it was argued) was part of the house or precincts,
where a person might properly be said to be at home. But
in this case also, the libel was found not to be relevant to
the effect of inflicting death<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Found, That the said pannel having, time and place foresaid, invaded the persons of any of the servants of the said John Horsely, by beating, wounding, or otherwise, or the pannel having at that time instigated the Sinclairs to exe∣cute their revenge against the said John Horsely, or his family, <HI>separatim,</HI> re∣levant to inser an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT although,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be Hame∣sucken without Entry of the House.</NOTE> in the sense now explained, a man's house,
be the only place where he enjoys this high protection; yet
it is not therefore to be understood, that hamesucken can∣not
be committed without actual entry of the house by the
offender. Certainly this is not the law. If ruffians be∣set
a house with intent to murder the master, and they
fire at him from without, through a door or window thereof,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
and wound him, being within the house; or if, having
knocked at the door under cloud of night, and caused the
master open, one of them instantly thrust at him through
the opening, with a sword, and wound him, so that he falls
down in the entrance within the house; in both cases there
is a proper hamesucken. For though the invader have ne∣ver
entered, still the sufferer has been attacked and wounded
within his house, and the protection and security thereof,
have been broken and contemned by the invader.</P>
<P>NOT only so;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sufficient that the Assault be∣gin within the House.</NOTE> but it will justify the charge of hamesucken,
if the assault but commence upon the man, at a time when
he is within the house, or if the house be assailed with in∣tent
to harm him, though the material injury in his person
be done to him without. Put the case, that when the mas∣ter
opens the invaders enter the house, and collar and vio∣lently
pull him forth, notwithstanding his resistance, into
the highway or street, where they set upon and beat him
with staves; this, according to the received construction in
such matters, is as substantial a hamesucken, as if they had
beaten him within the house; since he is forcibly taken by
the pannels from thence, and there is begun to be invaded
with a purpose of doing that outrageous injury, which in the
end is done.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, No. 62.</NOTE> And of this remark, the case of Robert Mac∣gregor,
convicted in January 1753, of the abduction of Jean
Key from her own house, is an apt illustration. For the only
injury sustained by the woman within her house, was in the
commencement of the assault, by violently carrying her
from thence, which was done without any beating or wound∣ing
of her person, though in opposition to her struggles.
But this was to be taken in connection with the abduction
to a distance, and the continued captivity, which were the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
sequel of the injury, and the first objects of the assault. He
accordingly had sentence of death, as convicted of hame∣sucken.</P>
<P>IT seems to deserve the same construction, if a band of
ruffians beset and break into the house; whereupon the mas∣ter,
to save himself, leaps the window, and they follow and
overtake and wound him. A deliberate invasion of the
house, on purpose to do mischief to the master, is an invasion
of the man himself. It is as much a <HI>force</HI> upon him, and a
personal injury, when he is driven from the house in this
way, as if the invaders reached in and dragged him forth, or
entered and threw him out at the window: The safeguard of
the house is equally broken in either case, and the man for∣cibly
deprived of that protection, which the law intends for
him there. This, too, is agreeable to Skene's definition of
hamesucken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">De Verb. signif. <HI>u.</HI> Hamesucken; also his Treatise of Crimes, ch. 9.</NOTE>, who says, it is committed, “when a person
enters within a man's house, or seeks him at the same, <HI>or
assailzies his house.</HI>” And in this, Skene only follows the
words of the Regiam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 4. ch. 9.</NOTE> “<HI>Quod propria domus assaliata sit.</HI>”</P>
<P>IN Mackenzie's opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of one en∣ticed from his House and in∣vaded.</NOTE> the same judgment is even to be
passed on the pannel, if, by artifice, he has enticed his vic∣tim
to quit the house, and only then invades him, when he
has come forth; “because, (saith he), he cannot profit of his
“own fraud.” But there seems to be a double reason
against this decision. First, in the great latitude of con∣struction
to which it would lead. For on this plan, it might
be necessary to judge an assault as hamesucken, which is
made at the distance of miles from the person's house; if by
letter, or false pretence of business, he be drawn thither.
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
And farther; because this way of proceeding, base and cruel
though it be, plainly indicates the awe and fear that was
upon the pannel, of assailing the person in his house. Either
he durst not, on his own account, venture on so dangerous an
enterprise, or he had some remains of reverence for the sanc∣tuary
of a habitation; and therefore drew he the object of
his malice from it. In either case, he is not so bold and pro∣fligate
a character, as he who goes to seek and invade the
object of his malice there. In fine, we cannot, without en∣tirely
altering our notion of the crime, conceive it to be
committed without a violation of the security of the person's
home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. and Feb. 2. 1728.</NOTE> I observe, accordingly, that in the case of Arbuth∣not
and Falconer, and upon this precise state of facts, viz.
the enticing a person from his house, by a message, on pre∣tence
of business, and beating him at a short distance from
it, to the effusion of his blood, the interlocutor limits the
relevancy to an arbitrary pain.<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">“The Lords found, that at the time libelled, after the complainer was cal∣led out of his house to speak with one that waited for him, which accordingly he having done, and having come up to the pannels, the said William Falco∣ner pannel, did, with a whip, stick, or such weapon, strick the complainer on the face, to the effusion of his blood, or that the said pannel or Mr. John Arbuth∣not, the other pannel, was art and part thereof, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and repelled the haill defences.”</NOTE> Indeed, it was even in the
pleading admitted, that the charge did not amount to the
capital offence.</P>
<P>II. THUS much of the <HI>place where</HI> hamesucken may be
committed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is forcible En∣try of the House material?</NOTE> In regard to the manner of the assault: It
will be obvious, from what has been said, that it is not
essential to hamesucken, in those cases where there has been
entry of the house, that it be made by downright force or
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
essraction of the building. The notion of the crime goes
only thus far, that there be an entry against the King's
peace; that is with the felonious purpose of breaking the
peace, and invading some one of the inhabitants. Hame∣sucken
is therefore committed, in like manner as house∣breaking
also is, though the entry be by terrifying those
within, so that they open, (which was the way of entry in
the case of Johnston, in 1754); or by enticing them to open
under some false pretence; or by secretly entering and lying
hidden till the convenient season come to assault; provided
always that due proof is made by circumstances, of the
felonious purpose of the invader, as at the time of his entry.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entry must be on Purpose to assault.</NOTE> whatsoever in other respects may be the manner of
the assault on the house; one undoubted and invariable re∣quisite
of it is, that it be done on purpose, and out of malice
aforethought; for it is in the circumstance of the premedita∣ted
<HI>seeking</HI> of the person at his home, to assault him, that the
aggravated and distinctive character of hamesucken entirely
lies.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is founded not only in the nature of the thing, but in the German ety∣mology of the term <HI>hamesucken. Heim</HI> is home; <HI>suchen</HI> to seek. <HI>Heimsuchen</HI> is to visit. <HI>Heimsuchung</HI> is a visit. <HI>Das fest der heimsuchung,</HI> is “the feast of the “<HI>visitation.</HI>”</NOTE>. No outrage, therefore, be it ever so gross, suffered by a
person in his own house, will ground this high charge, if it
only happens in the course of some sudden and occasional
quarrel with the invaders, being already peaceably and law∣fully
there; not even though there have been a previous
grudge between them and the sufferer, if the purpose to
gratify it, as at that time and place, is only taken up at the
moment, and in presence of the party, upon some new and
casual provocation. The like defence will serve, if the as∣sault
is at first made on the complainer in the street or
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
in the fields; so that any violence he suffers in his house, is
only in the prosecution of that assault, when he has fled
thither for refuge, and has been instantly pursued. For this
happens from heat of blood, which is not so criminal as de∣liberate
revenge. It was for this reason, that in the case of
Thomson and Inglis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 16. &amp; 23. 1719.</NOTE> which was a case of invasion of a per∣son's
house, after a scuffle with him on the street, the pro∣secutor
judged it proper to depart from the charge of hame∣sucken,
and restrict his libel to an arbitrary punishment.</P>
<P>THE quality of hamesucken is in like manner excluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What, if the En∣try was to com∣mit a different Crime?</NOTE>
even in a case of criminal and felonious entry of the house,
if it be made with a purpose of quite a different sort, such
as that of fire-raising, which is meant to be executed with∣out
the knowledge of the inhabitants. If, being alarmed,
and endeavouring to take the felon, the master of the house
chance to be wounded in the conflict, the assault will not be
capital; not being done upon forethought, but occasionally,
and for the sake of escape, or upon the like suggestion of
the moment. Farther; even a tortious and deliberate assault
of a man's person within his house will not in every instance
infer hamesucken; since this may happen, and yet the as∣sault
may not be made with that felonious <HI>animus,</HI> wherein
the aggravation lies. For what if the attempt be owing to
error on the part of the invader, or be made under misappre∣hension
of right; as for instance, in order to apprehend the
inhabitant of the house as a debtor, or as a criminal, when in
truth there is no regular warrant against him, or when he is
mistaken for another person? Certainly the officer must
answer for any violence that ensues, but not as for a hame∣sucken;
acting, as he here does, under an impression, though
erroneous, of right and duty, and not intending to assault,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
but to do a lawful'act. Much less is it to be imagined that
there is room for such a charge, on the ground of irregular
or excessive proceedings in the execution of a warrant
which is lawful. And of this remark there is an apt illustra∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13. 1677.</NOTE>
in the interlocutor upon the charge against James
Adamson<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Lord finds the third article, in so far as concerns hamesucken, blood∣ing and wounding, relevant; as also, finds the defence, bearing, that the de∣fender Glengarroch, or his brother, had a warrant from the Marquis of Hunt∣ly, to apprehend vagabonds and sorners; and that by virtue thereof, they had apprehended one or two, who were forcibly taken from them by the pursuers, and carried to the house of Nethermill; and that shortly thereafter, the de∣fenders went to the said house to redemand them, relevant to eleide the crime and qualification of <HI>hamesucken,</HI> but not to eleide the crimes of <HI>wounding and blooding;</HI> and remits,” &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. THE last article for our consideration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Hamesucken without Inva∣sion of the Per∣son.</NOTE> is the nature
and extent of the injury which shall be held to warrant a pro∣secution
of this sort. It is implied in all that has been said,
that the assault must be upon the person; and those autho∣rities
which speak of the house being assailed, are still to be
understood in this sense, though not always fully expressed,
that the assault on the house is with a view to the doing of
some personal injury; which purpose is in some degree at
least accomplished. The most violent entry, therefore, of the
house, and followed with the riotous destruction of all the
effects within it, and even with threats and abuse of words
to the inhabitants, but without invasion of their persons, or
violence offered to any of them, will not sustain this sort of
charge.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>
THE injury suffered on the occasion, must also be grievous
and material.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Injury must be material.</NOTE> For it is not to be imagined, that the law in∣tends
to punish with death for a mere rout and disturb∣ance
in a man's house, though accompanied with some slight
wrong to his person, such as savours more of insult and con∣tempt,
than of enmity or resolution to do him harm. And
of this rule a convenient example may be found in the case of
John Haldane;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. and Aug. 5. 1718.</NOTE> where, though the libel charges that the pro∣secutor
had been caught by the throat, and had a cane sha∣ken
over his head, and was even raised from his bed, under
cloud of night, by a party of armed men, who forced or
took him into the street, yet “the Lords found the facts,
as libelled, not to be of a nature so atrocious as to infer
the crime of hamesucken<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">According to the pannel's story, which seems not unlikely, (but the judg∣ment was not put upon this circumstance), the ground of complaint was no more than the irregular execution of a warrant, arising from the rescue of the pro∣secutor's smuggled goods, on the preceding day.</NOTE></P>
<P>ON the other side;<NOTE PLACE="marg">But may be of various Kinds, and for different Objects.</NOTE> if the injury is of the due rank and
degree, little distinction seems to be made concerning the
description of it in other respects. Not only all the modes
of instant harm to the body are within the meaning of
the law; as by stabbing, or firing at and wounding, or vio∣lently
beating the person; or by binding and starving, or
confining within the house; but those also where the pre∣sent
bodily harm is inconsiderable, compared with the suf∣fering
of other sorts which attends it, and without which it
would not at all be regarded. Thus it is hamesucken, to at∣tempt
the committing of a rape on a woman in her own
house; or violently to carry her off from thence into captivity,
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
whether with a view to rape or to a forcible marriáge. For
the injury is not to be measured by the mere suffering of the
body, but by the whole accompanying circumstances of di∣stress,
alarm, and terror, and the colour of the evil that is
intended to be done. This point was argued at large in
the case of James Macgregor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 60. 62.</NOTE> and was decided in that
of his brother Robert<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The major proposition of the libel, described the crime thus: “The violent entering the house of the deceased without her licence, and contrary to the King's peace; the seeking or assaulting her there, with intent to do her a most heinous and atrocious injury, namely, the crimes which actually follow∣ed, being the abduction of her person, the celebrating a marriage with her, and the violation of her chastity; all of them gone about forcibly, and by way of continuation of the same violent and wicked attempt.”</NOTE>, who suffered death for invading
Jean Key in her own house, and forcibly carrying her from
thence, in order to compel her to a marriage. So much
is this the law, that cases may well be imagined where
hamesucken shall be committed, though the body be nowise
hurt, if the person be, in a proper sense, invaded; as if a
man be fired at in his house, or be pursued through it, from
room to room, with a drawn sword, though in the end he
escape unhurt, and suffer no injury but in the fear and
danger of his life. And much the same thing it seems to
be, if by menace of death, and the holding of a pistol to
his head, or a dagger to his throat, a person is forced to sub∣scribe
a bond for money, or the release of a debt that is
due to him. Money is indeed the pannel's ultimate object
in such a case, (as it may also be in the case of abduction,
and as lust generally is in the case of rape): But this will
not hinder us to conceive the crime as hamesucken, since
the personal assault is a necessary means towards attainment
of those ends; so that whoever would accomplish the one,
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
must intend the other. The truth is, that a false notion
seems to have gone abroad respecting hamesucken, as if
it consisted only in that sort of injury, the <HI>beating</HI> of the
person, which more ordinarily than any other is the ob∣ject
of such enterprises. Whereas the notion of it in law,
and which is announced in so many words in the outset of
many of the older libels, (as in the case of Meldrum,
December 7. 1674, and of Muir, November 8. and 9. 1675),
is far more general, and consists in “the seeking of a
person at his house to do him an injury, prejudice, or
hurt.” And so says Skene in his Treatise of Crimes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It is explained at large in the same sense by Mathaeus, as understood in the law of Utrecht.</NOTE>:
Haymsucken is when ane man searches and seeks ane
other man at his house, or assailzies his house to slay him,
<HI>or to do him any injury,</HI> whilk crime is punished be death
and confiscation of his moveable gudes.”</P>
<P>IV. THE prosecution for hamesucken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosecution; to what Time li∣mited.</NOTE> like that for robbe∣ry
and murder, is said to have been subject of old to a very
narrow limitation, in respect of the competent time for com∣mencing
it<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. b. 4. ch. 10.</NOTE>. But this rule has now, for more than a cen∣tury,
been so entirely altered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 11. 1692.</NOTE> that in the case of Keith of
Lentush, action was sustained at the distance of more than
three years. As a ground of presumption against the truth
of the charge, a long delay to prosecute for this or any
other high injury, will, however, always be considered by
the assize.</P>
<P>MACKENZIE has remarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Wit∣nesses in it.</NOTE> that with respect to the mat∣ter
of proof, this is a privileged crime; as being for the
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
most part only possible to be established by the testimony of
the near connections of the party injured. This appears
from the interlocutor in the case of Thomas Muir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1675.</NOTE> admit∣ting
women to be witnesses, (contrary to the practice of those
times), “in respect the crime is domestic.” There was doubt∣less
good reason for such an indulgence in the nature of the
offence; which will always be committed at the seasons the
most favourable to the offender, and for the most part
among domestics and near relations. Therefore, a relaxa∣tion
of the ordinary rules of the present day in that respect,
may probably be allowed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF REAL INJURIES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated at some length of the crimes of Mur∣der,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX.</NOTE>
Rape, and Hamesucken, the only <HI>offences against
the person</HI> to which the punishment of death is annexed by
ancient custom, I shall in this chapter submit my observa∣tions
concerning the other delicts of the same general
class. Of these, some are subject to a precise and a severe
punishment, in virtue of special statutes, which have raised
them above their rank at common law. For others, the
offender is only liable to some inferior correction, at the
pleasure of the Judge. I shall begin with the former.</P>
<P>AMONG which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute against beating or cur∣sing or Parents.</NOTE> the most remarkable instance of any is
created by the statute 1661, ch. 20. which ordains, “That
whosoever, son or daughter, above the age of sixteen years,
not being distracted, shall beat or curse either their father or
mother, shall be put to death without mercy; and such as
are within the age of sixteen years, and past the age of
pupillarity, to be punished at the arbitriment of the Judge,
according to their deservings, that others may hear and
fear, and not do the like.” The object of this enactment,
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
was not only to guard the parent against the violence of per∣sons,
who have so many opportunities of indulging their
hatred, if once, unhappily, they shall come to be possessed
with it; but also, and perhaps chiefly, for the interest of mo∣rality
and order, which are so deeply wounded by the unna∣tural
spectacle of the hand of the child lifted against the pa∣rent,
or his tongue directing curses against those whom most
he ought to cherish and revere.</P>
<P>THE statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisites of the statutory Charge.</NOTE> very properly, requires two things towards
the inflicting of the capital punishment; such an age, and
such a measure of understanding, in the pannel, as give as∣surance
of his knowing the due reverence of a parent, and
make him accountable for the violation of it. Though not
expressed in the law, it seems also to be a good defence
against the statutory charge, that the parent has occasion∣ed
the injury by cruel and excessive abuse of the person of
the pannel. Not that common injuries will excuse any sort of
retaliation on the part of the child, who, by law and nature,
is subject to, and must patiently suffer, the parents judgment
and correction, (even though arbitrary and capricious), both
of words and personal discipline. But that the Legislature
have not <HI>utterly</HI> excluded this defence of provocation, which
applies in all other cases of assault, and probably did not in∣tend
to punish the child with the severest pains of law, for
words, (how unseemly soever), nor even for blows, if only
extorted by the outrageous severity of bodily chastisement.</P>
<P>To be relevant under the statute, the charge must also be
of a proper and real assault, by striking and hurting; not of
a mere struggle or wrestling, without blows or injury to the
person. In like manner the cursing, which is, however,
capital without any beating, must not consist in undutiful or
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
indecent words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">REAL INJURIES.</NOTE> spoken of or with relation to the parent; as
by wishing for his death, or that evil may befal him, or
threatening him with mischief, or the like; but in some
strong and violent execration directed against him. If the
words are uttered in the presence of the parent, this, in every
point of view, is the highest degree of the transgression; the
strongest mark of the depravity of the child, who, if he offend,
in this way, must be steeled against all sense of awe and re∣verence,
and the greatest shock to the feelings of the parent,
and of all who hear it. The words of the statute do not,
however, seem to authorise any distinction in that respect;
and, from the tenor of the charge which was found relevant
in the case of Philip Stansfield,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 23. and Feb. 6.&amp; 7. 1688.</NOTE> it is at least doubtful whether
any of the words libelled were uttered in the presence of
his father. The Court in that case, “found these expres∣sions,
or either of them, viz. the devil take him, the devil
rive him, God damn him, relevant to infer the pain of
death.” In regard to certain other expressions, which
are charged in the libel, such as the wishing that his father
might never return—that he might choke upon his meat—or
never more have food in his stomach; the interlocutor does
not take notice of them. He was convicted both of the cur∣sing
and the killing of his father, and had sentence of death,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, vol. iv. p. 283.</NOTE>.
In the later case of David Young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 26. and July 24. 1738.</NOTE> for
cursing his mother,
the like relevancy was found on these expressions, “God
damn you for an old bitch; or, God damn you for an old
liar.” But this man was not convicted.</P>
<P>IN both instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of the Charge of cur∣sing Parents.</NOTE> the precise words uttered by the pannel
were set forth in the libel; which for this reason, if for no
other, seems to be the proper practice, that the pursuer other∣wise
arrogates to himself the entire cognisance of the mean∣ing
of the term <HI>cursing</HI> used in the statute, and thereby the
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
decision on the relevancy of his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> charge. In the case,
however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. and Aug. 4. 1735.</NOTE> of James Brown and Elizabeth Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>almers his wife,
for cursing and beating Brown's mother, a more general
charge of <HI>cursing</HI> was allowed to pass without objection;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel charges simply, “That James Brown did presume to curse <HI>and</HI> to beat, and lift up his ungodly hands without any just cause or provocation against the said deceased Anna Cockburn his mother.” The interlocutor finds it relevant to infer death, “James Brown pannel, having at the time and place libelled, beat <HI>or</HI> cursed the deceased Anna Cockburn his mother.”</NOTE>;
but proba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y for this reason only, that beating as well as
cursing was charged, and that both were joined to a charge
of murder by means of the beating; hereby the other heads
of the libel were of the less importance.</P>
<P>IN this trial the point was settled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relation to whom the Act applies.</NOTE> that father and mo∣ther
by affinity are not within the just construction of the
statute. For as far as concerned Elizabeth Chalmers,
the beating of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mother-in-law was found relevant to
infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords found James Brown pannel, having, at the time and place li∣belled, beat or cursed the deceased A. C. his mother, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of moveables; as also, found that the said James Brown, and Elizabeth Chalmers the other pannel, that they, or either of them, having at the time and place libelled, beaten the said Anna to that degree, that she, of the stroaks given her did shortly thereafter die, or that they or either of them were art and part of the murder of the said Anna, relevant to infer the foresaid pains; and, <HI>separatim,</HI> the said Lords found, that at time and place libelled, she the said Elizabeth Chalmers having beaten the said Anna Cockburn relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>; and being convicted of
only this part of the charge, she was adjudged to be scourged
at two different times. Her husband was convicted not only
of the beating but the murder, and suffered death. Whether
the statute will apply in the case of grandfather or grandmo∣ther
being cursed or beaten, has not yet been resolved by
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
any judgment; but Mackenzie<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Tit. Parricide, No. 6.</NOTE> hath said that it will not;
and the decision in the case of Chalmers, serves, in some
measure, as an argument for his opinion.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER class of persons for whose personal security
the Legislature have made peculiar provisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against as∣saulting of Cler∣gymen.</NOTE> are the Clergy
of the Established Church of Scotland; whose character and
function ought to serve as a protection to them against any sort
of violence, and even at common law would sharpen the seve∣rity
of the sentence upon any who should invade them. But
in our times of religious schism, and while things were fluc∣tuating
between the Presbyterian establishment and the Epis∣copal,
far from proving a shield to the clergy, their func∣tion
was the very circumstance which exposed them, as
the peculiar objects of aversion, to every sort of molesta∣tion
from the adherents of the opposite communion; as in∣deed
it must be owned, that the clergy themselves, of either
persuasion, were not slow to encourage their followers to
the like persecution of their antagonists. Statutes were
therefore passed, at different periods, for the better protec∣tion
of the establishment for the time. By the act 1587,
c. 27. it is punishable with escheat of moveables, to invade
or lay violent hands upon a minister, if it be done on ac∣count
of things pertaining to his function, such as inflicting
ecclesiastical censures, refusal to marry excommunicated
persons, seeking payment of his stipend, or the like. The
act 1633, c. 7. extends this penalty to the invasion of the
dignified clergy, at that time re-established, and to the in∣vasion
of ministers on any account, and whether made by
the offender personally, or through others by his direction
or allowance. Lastly; by statute 1670, c. 4. at a time of
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
great bitterness between the rival churches, the punishment
was raised to death and confiscation of moveables, in the
case of assault with intent to kill a minister, or to rob his
house; for in this sense I construe the words of that law.</P>
<P>THE present century has furnished two instances of prose∣cution
for assaulting a minister.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosecutions on these laws.</NOTE> One was in February 1719,
against Ensign Beaver, an Englishman, for striking the mini∣ster
of Kirkden with fist and cane, on occasion of some contro∣versy
which had arisen between them in company, touching
the relative merits of the Episcopal and Presbyterian com∣munions.
It was found relevant to infer the statutory pains,
“That he beat Mr Henderson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. and Mar. 2. 1719.</NOTE> knowing at the time that
he was a minister;” and being convicted he had sentence
of escheat of moveables, in terms of the act of James VI.
This too was given upon a libel at instance of the Lord Ad∣vocate
only; for the private party had pardoned the injury,
and disclaimed the prosecution. The prosecutor in the
other case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9. &amp; 10. 1784.</NOTE> that of Dr Bryden, minister of Dalton, against
Murray, as he was not entitled to, so neither did he meet
with the same success. He restricted his libel to the pains
of law as for an ordinary assault. But the jury found a ver∣dict
for the pannel; and the Court found the prosecutor
liable in L. 77 of expences.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD class of persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Striking of Judges.</NOTE> in whose favour statute has
interposed, to protect them from any fear of harm in the
discharge of their duty, are the Judges of the land; whose
office of dispensing justice, is that which, next to the mini∣stry
of religion, has the strongest claim to reverence and ho∣nour.

of certain of our old statutes concerning matters of the
like sort. By act 1593, c. 177. whoever shall strike in the Par∣liament
House during the sitting of Parliament; or in presence
of the King wherever he is; or in the King's inner chamber,
cabinet, or chamber of presence, the King being within his
palace at the time; is punishable with the pains of treason.
The same pains are applied by this statute to the striking
within the King's Privy Council House, during the sitting of
Council; and for this offence, John Young “poultryman,”
had sentence of death, on the 11th October 1627. But these
are among the treasons which are abolished by the act 7th Anne,
ch. 21; though as assaults, aggravated by contempt of the
high presence in which they are done, they remain liable to
some severe correction at common law.</P>
<P>BY the same statute it is made a capital crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Striking in the King's Palace.</NOTE> (and this seems
still to be our law), to strike within the inner gate of the King's
palace, while the King is there. And even to repair within
the place of the King's residence for the time, armed with jack,
secret, or corslet, or to invade or pursue any one within a mile
of such place, is punishable, by the act 1600, c. 26. with im∣prisonment
for a year, and until composition made with the
King for the trespass. I find, that on the 12th August 1603,
partly for offending against this statute, and partly against
those touching the invasion of ministers, Walter Graham was
adjudged to be scourged, and to have his right hand struck
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
off; having assaulted a minister within a mile of the King's
palace of Holy rood house.</P>
<P>THESE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of Counsellor for Service done the King.</NOTE> as history informs us, are provisions which were
rendered necessary by the rudeness of the times; and ano∣ther,
(the last that shall be mentioned), which had the same
origin, but is still in force, is that of the act. 1600, c. 4.
which ordains, that whosoever shall invade or pursue any of
the King's officers, or any member of his Majesty's Session or
Secret Council, if this be done on account of service rendered
to his Majesty, “shall be punished to the death.” One noted
instance of capital conviction upon this act, is that of James
Mitchell in January 1678, for firing a pistol at Bishop Sharp,
on account of the active part which that prelate had taken
in the King's service, (as it was then construed), against
the deluded Covenanters<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find that article of the dittay found it upon the 4th act, 16th Parliament, James VI. bearing the pannel's invading, by shooting and firing a pistol at his Grace the Archbishop of St Andrew's, a Privy Counsellor, for doing of his Majesty's service, relevantly libelled; his Majesty's Advocate proving the pre∣sumption in his reply, viz. That the said pannel said that he did make the said invasion and attempt, because of the Archbishop his prosecuting those that were in the rebellion at Pentland, or some words to that purpose, relevant to infer the pain contained in the foresaid act of Parliament.” The other points of the libel were found only relevant to infer an arbitrary pain.</NOTE>. Mitchell was proved to have
said, “That he thought Sharp an enemy to the godly, and
that they could not be in peace as long as he should live.”
When apprehended, he had also said, with relation to his
attempt, “That it was no deed done in cold blood; for the
blood of the saints, which Sharp had shed, was yet reek∣ing
at the cross of Edinburgh.” And thus the prosecutor
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
made out the necessary quality of the invasion, as being for
the part taken by Sharp in affairs of state<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“As to the first part of the libel, founded upon the 4th act, 16th Parlia∣ment, James VI. the Chancellor and whole assize, with one voice, find it proven, conform to the Lords interlocutor; as to the invading of bishops and ministers, and wounding the Bishop of Orkney, siclike proven with one voice.”. January 10. 1678.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>5. LET us now descend to those offences against the per∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Assaults pu∣nishable at com∣mon Law.</NOTE>
which remain upon the foot of common law, and are
only punishable with some inferior pain, at the discretion
of the Court. These are various in kind and degree; and
the law is provided with sundry corresponding terms for
them, more or less comprehensive, such as assault, invasion,
beating and bruising, blooding and wounding, stabbing, mu∣tilation,
demembration, and some others, under which, ac∣cording
to the nature of the injury, the fact may be charged
in any libel. But although the injury should not come un∣der
any of the ordinary terms of style, nor be of that nature,
to be announced in a single phrase; this circumstance will
nowise affect the competency of a prosecution. Let the
<HI>major</HI> proposition of the libel give an intelligible account of
it in terms at large, and, if it amount to a real injury, it shall
be sustained to infer punishment, greater or less, <HI>pro modo
admissi;</HI> without any regard to the new or extraordinary na∣ture
of the wrong. We have, besides, in our law, the general
term of <HI>stellionate,</HI> borrowed from the Roman practice, where
it was applied to every offence that was not distinguished by a
peculiar name, and which, if it is thought worth while, may
be employed in such a case, along with the full description
of the injury. This was done in the libel against James
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. 15. 22. 1722.</NOTE> which bore a charge of certain strange and
shameful violations of the pursuer's person<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Macnaughton and Campbell were prisoners in the same goal. Campbell had filled Macnaughton drunk, stripped him in part naked, and tied his privities with a cord to some fixture in the fire-place. In this situation, he repeatedly applied fire to those parts of the man's body, as he lay stretched upon chairs by the fire-place. This was charged in the outset of the libel as <HI>stellionate</HI> and real inju∣ry; along with a description of the wrong.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>6. THE most heinous sort of assault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wounding with Intent to kill.</NOTE> is that which is com∣mitted,
not with intent to hurt or wound, but to destroy.
In which case, though, by the benignity of our practice,
the offender is judged according to the event, and not ac∣cording
to the wickedness of his heart, yet the Judge is
warranted to inflict the highest pains on him that are known
to the law, after those of death. In three late instances of
this character, the offender has been transported for life.
I allude to the case of Alexander Syme, December 16.
1754, for shooting at and wounding in the head; to the
case of John Ogilvy, March 8. 1756, for stabbing in the
belly; and to the case of Thomas Young, July 8. 11. 1771,
for stabbing a person in the side, as he lay asleep. In the last
case, death had only been prevented by the knife breaking
short upon a rib.</P>
<P>IN all these instances, the mortal purpose had been followed
with a seyere and grievous wound inflicted on the person. But
even when no such bodily harm ensues, still the invading with
intent to kill, as by shooting, or thrusting with a sword, is an
aggravated species of assault, for which the offender shall
be subject to prosecution, as well at instance of the pri∣vate
party, as of the King. Because, though not hurt in his
body, the individual has nevertheless a substantial interest
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
to prosecute, both on account of the real injury and
suffering in the instant fear of his life, and in order to
deter the offender from any renewal of his attempt. After
full debate, his title was accordingly sustained in such a
case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1744.</NOTE> that of James Justice and David Hume<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lord Kames was then at the bar, and was counsel for the pannels, and had stirred this objection to the pursuer's title.</NOTE>; and Justice,
being convicted, was decreed to pay L. 150 of damages and
costs.</P>
<P>BESIDE this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assault with In∣tent to ravish, or rob, or extort a Deed.</NOTE> the most alarming of any, there are other
purposes of mischief which very much aggravate an assault
upon the person, and make it liable to greater severity of
punishment than could be used, on pure consideration of the
harm which is suffered in the body. Thus an assault upon
a woman is aggravated, and may be punished with banish∣ment
and whipping, or other infamous pain, if it is made
with intent to ravish, or to carry off her person. The same
is true of an assault upon any one, if it be made with in∣tention
to rob, or to compel the granting of a deed, or the
like; for this puts in fear of the highest violence, in case of
resistance or delay to comply.</P>
<P>AMONG those injuries which are carried the length of actual
harm to the person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demembration, if a capital crime.</NOTE> one of the most atrocious is by the separa∣tion
of any member from the body, which is termed <HI>demembra∣tion;</HI>
or by the <HI>mutilation</HI> of any member, that is the wounding
of it in such a manner, as renders it unserviceable to its pro∣per
uses. Some things have even contributed to raise a doubt
respecting these modes of injury, whether in strictness, and
according to the ancient practice, the offender was not
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
liable to the highest pains of law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stat. 11. No. 2.</NOTE> The old statute of Ro∣bert
II. speaking of him who is convicted of mutilation,
says, that he shall redeem his life, and satisfy the party lesed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Et si convictus fuerit, redimet vitam suam, et satisfaciet parti laesae.”</NOTE>.
Likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540, c. 118.; 1579, c. 76. and 1612, c. 3.</NOTE> in several of our authentic statutes, which take or∣der
for the prosecution of crimes, those of mutilation and de∣membration
are either said to be capital offences, or are
classed with such as are so. Moreover, it appears from the
criminal record, that when sentence passed on the mutilator
for any lower punishment, it was usual to decern him, (as if
something were still wanting to his entire absolvitor and
protection), to procure a remission from the King, and let∣ters
of slains, (as in the case of homicide), from the private
party<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This was done in these cases, February 19. 1608, Davidson against Duncan: July 15▪ August 5. 1642, Cheyne against Mowat and Niven.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demembration, if a capital Crime.</NOTE> there seems reason to conclude upon the
whole, that the statute of Robert, which is not expressed in
an absolute or peremptory style, was only intended <HI>in terrorem,</HI>
for obliging the offender to make reparation to the party
lesed, and thus extinguish the feud that was between them.
Certain it is, that the record does not afford a single in∣stance
of capital conviction for this offence. Nay in
one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 14. 1609. and, April 18. 1610.</NOTE> and an old case, that of Andrew Henderson, on re∣ference
of the proper doom for mutilation to the King
and Council, there came an act and order recommending
to banish the pannel, “seing y<SUP>e</SUP> paine of daith in any
such caice has nocht bene accustomit to be execute in
this kingdome.” Mackenzie, accordingly, has not only
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
omitted to take any special notice of these, as distinct from
other real injuries, but farther, in his observations on the act
1540, c. 118. has said in very plain terms that they are not
capital offences. Add to these the opinion of Pitmed∣den,
who, in his treatise of these crimes, comes to this
conclusion, “That mutilation and demembration are now
punishable <HI>poena injuriarum arbitraria,</HI> like other injuries
committed by private violence, for which the law states
no particular punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Part II. No. 159.</NOTE>.” And in truth there is a judg∣ment,
though not taken notice of in either of these authorities,
which seems to be decisive of the whole controversy; having
been given in a case, which probably was not tried with any
degree of favour towards the pannel; the case of James
Mitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 1678.</NOTE> who in firing at Bishop Sharp, had wounded and
mutilated the Bishop of Orkney, (who was in the coach
with Sharp), in the arm. The dittay was laid for the crime
of mutilation among others, and concluded for the pains
of death; which were also insisted for in the debate. But,
the Court upon full consideration found, “that article of
the dittay anent the invading, wounding and mutilating
of the Bishop of Orkney, relevant to infer an arbitrary
punishment.”</P>
<P>IT thus becomes of no moment to engage in those nume∣rous
and minute controversies, which subsist among the fo∣reign
doctors respecting several points of this sort of charge,
and especially touching the several parts of the human frame,
how far they are to be reputed distinct members of the body,
whereof mutilation or demembration can be committed.
For, without regard to that circumstance, and though no
such terms should be employed in the charge, there is always
room for inflicting an adequate and proper punishment on
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
the offender. In like manner, there seems now no longer
to be any good reason why process for mutilation should not
be sustained (contrary to the ancient practice),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Process for Mu∣tilation, if com∣petent within the Year.</NOTE> before lapse
of year and day from the date of the injury. Such a rule
might indeed be very suitable, as long as it was imagined
that the pannel's life might perhaps be answerable for his
offence; but it would not serve any useful purpose at the pre∣sent
day, when the party lesed can only lay his libel for an
arbitrary punishment, and, if he raise his action at an early
period, must accept of such an atonement as upon inspec∣tion
of the wound, and according to the proof of what he
has already endured, the Court shall consider to be due to
him. If he be content with this amends, there is no reason
why the pannel should constrain him to delay his prosecu∣tion,
until it shall be evident whether the member is mutila∣ted
past recovery or not. Action was therefore sustained
within the year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 50.</NOTE> upon a libel which charged the fact under
the various terms of mutilation, invading, beating, and
wounding.</P>
<P>THE usual course of punishment in cases of mutilation
and other the like atrocious injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for violent As∣saults.</NOTE> when prosecuted for
the public interest, has been by scourging, and banishment
forth of Scotland. This was the sentence, (among many
instances that might be mentioned), upon Archibald Mathie
and Robert Falconar for an outrageous act of bruising and
beating;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 3. 1791. Dec. 27. 1791.</NOTE> and upon John Macalister, for wounding in the face
with a knife, whereby an artery was cut, and the person
put in danger of his life. In cases of inferior violence,
recourse is had to imprisonment and fine, and, if the party
lesed pursues, and the pannel can pay, to an award of costs
and damages, in addition to those penalties; together, in
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
some cases, with surety to keep the peace for a certain
time.</P>
<P>7. THE other articles which may seem to be material to∣wards
the better knowledge of the doctrine respecting assault
or real injury, are chiefly these. The degree of violence,
which is thought worthy of the cognisance of the Supreme
Court; the sort of provocation that will justify the act, or
alleviate the guilt; and the ways wherein the injury may
be remitted.</P>
<P>As to the first of these heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slight Assaults, if cognisable in the Court of Justiciary.</NOTE> it will be difficult to fix on
any precise rule of limitation. The Legislature have not
interposed in this, as in the civil department of business, to
hinder the bringing of the less important cases, in the first
instance, before the Supreme and most expensive Judicature.
Nor indeed are there the same reasons, nor would there be
the same propriety, in establishing such a rule for criminal
as for civil process. Because there is not the same multi∣plicity
of business to occupy the Judges of the Criminal
Court; and because no general rule could well be made to
suit the several qualities of crimes, which are so diversified by
circumstances; as well as that no case can justly be deemed
unworthy of the notice of even the highest tribunal, in which
the restraining of personal violence, or the interest of dis∣cipline
and order, is concerned.</P>
<P>NOT only, therefore, has it always been held actionable
before the Court of Justiciary, to strike with any sort of inva∣sive,
though not mortal weapon, such as cane, whip, or baton,
(of which it were tedious to recount the many convictions);
but even with the hand, or in any manner of way, to inflict
any blow or injury which either occasions a lasting in∣convenience,
such as lameness, inability to work or go
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
abroad, loss of sight or hearing, or the like, or is attended with
plain evidence of pain and suffering at the time, such as bring∣ing
the person to the ground, effusion of blood, or contusion
of body. These cases may be cited in proof of this rule of
practice; the case of William Ferguson, July 31. 1673<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds the pannels guilty of the riot after mentioned, viz. the said William Ferguson guilty of opprobrious speeches, and seconded with a <HI>blow;</HI> the said John Ferguson guilty of striking, and throwing the pursuer John Anderson down to the ground, which occasioned his blooding; and the said Walter Fer∣guson guilty of <HI>taking</HI> the said pursuer by the <HI>hair of the head.</HI>” They were severally decerned in payment of fines.

<P>FARTHER still;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slight Assaults, if cognisable by the Lords of Ju∣sticiary.</NOTE> due correction will be inflicted in that
Court, even on account of slighter acts of violence than any
of these, and such as savour more of contempt and indigni∣ty,
than of a purpose to harm the body, if in the whole
circumstances of the case, and between the parties concerned,
(for in such questions all circumstances must be weighed,
and the rank of the parties is a consideration which affects the
degree of injury), they are a serious wrong, or such as tends
to provoke a high revenge. For an assault of this sort, ac∣companied
with opprobrious expressions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1790.</NOTE> Alexander Paterson
was sentenced to a months imprisonment, and to find sure∣ty
to keep the peace. Relevancy was found against a She∣riff-Clerk,
for a still less violent invasion, but committed
upon a woman of condition, and enforced with threatening
and unseemly language: This was in the case of Catharine
Sinclair, Lady Dun, against Sir Robert Dunbar and others,
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
in November 1714<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Found that part of the libel relevant against the said William Campbell, viz. That he threatened to bore the Lady Dun's ears, and cut her clothes from about her, and actually took her by the shoulders, and violently turned her down stairs, to infer an arbitrary punishment, damages and expences, against him. November 22. 1714.”</NOTE>. Upon the whole, the only just ground
of remitting a case, as more proper to be tried in an inferior
court, may seem to be, that in the whole circumstances of the
charge, the expence of defending in the Court of Justiciary,
is higher than any fine or damages which could be levied
from the pannel on conviction. In the case of William Ir∣vine
of Gribtown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 29. 1718. Jan. 9. 1719.</NOTE> who was prosecuted by Alexander and
William Alves for sundry acts of disorder and violence, the
Lords proceeded to the trial of one article, being a charge
of beating, cutting, and blooding, and found that all the
remaining charges were more fit to be prosecuted in other
courts<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And as to the haill other articles of the said libel, the said Lords find the same more proper to be prosecuted, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst instance, before other compe∣tent courts; and therefore leaves the pursuers to prosecute their interests arising therefrom, either for a civil or criminal effect, before the other Judges compe∣tent, as accords.”</NOTE>. These were charges of personal struggle and throw∣ing
to the ground, accompanied with scurrilous and threaten∣ing
words, but not with any bruise or wound, or material bo∣dily
harm.</P>
<P>8. WITH respect to the defence of provocation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation of Words; if a good Plea.</NOTE> Thus far
seems to be settled, that no verbal provocation, no words,
how reproachful and contumelious soever, shall <HI>justify</HI> a vio∣lent
invasion or battery of the person. It is considered,
that the first blow is the beginning of violence, and power∣fully
excites to instant retortion in the same sort, whence
the most fatal excesses may ensue; and that society would
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
be full of disorder and contention, if blows were to be ex∣cused
under the pretence of words, which neither are neces∣sarily
hurtful, nor are capable of any precise measure or
estimation as to their evil qualities. Whereas by command
of temper thus far attained, (and it is the object of law to
teach such a controul of the passions), these unhappy con∣sequences
may be avoided, and things be left open to recon∣cilement
between the parties, at a season of better temper,
or on more serious reflection. The instances are accordingly
very numerous in which this defence has been passed over
without notice in the interlocutor of Court on the debate<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It seems to have been repelled in this way in these cases, among others; November 3. 17. 1712, Joseph Skinner; George Douglas, January 1725; James Hamilton, November 18. 1728; and Andrew Macpherson, January 13. 1755.</NOTE>.
And in the following, among other cases, upon verdict find∣ing
verbal provocation proved, the pannel had judgment, ne∣vertheless,
for damages and fine. David Hume was decreed
in L. 100 Sterling to the party, and 10 merks to the pub∣lic<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The jury, March 10. 1737, “Find it proven, that David Hume the pan∣nel, at the time and place libelled, did beat and abuse, and drag down stairs, Marjory Panton the pursuer, whereby her health was greatly impaired; as al∣so, find it proven, that the pursuer gave the pannel abusive and irritating lan∣guage.”</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 20. 22. 1748.</NOTE> and Robert Storie<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">“Find it proven, that the pannel, time and place libelled, received abusive and opprobrious language from, and was threatened by the prosecutor; and find it also proven, that the pannel was guilty of an assault and battery on the person of the prosecutor, to the effusion of his blood, which might cause an in∣flammation in his eye, and consequently the loss of it; but find, that proper care was not taken by the prosecutor for the preservation of his eye.”</NOTE>(beside a small fine), in L. 40 of
damages and L. 45 of expences.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59"/>
THOUGH this rule seems to be grounded in very expedient
reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation of Words; if a good Plea.</NOTE> I do not however mean to affirm, that the same
measure of punishment shall always be applied to a wanton
or malicious invasion, and to one which is only made on
provocation of foul and reproachful words, which may be
such, and uttered in such situations, that they are very hard
to be born. On such occasions, it may be desirable, but is
not always easy, to follow out the course of conduct which
is recommended by a foreign lawyer, the learned Berli∣chius.
The best method, says he, of retorting a verbal in∣jury
is thus. Let not the person attacked in this way open
his mouth upon the spot at all, but wait till the provoker has
finished his address, and thrown out against him all he has
to say. Then let him straight home,—fly to his closet,—
take pen in hand, and set down fairly in writing, whatever
his rage suggests to him as fit for the occasion. This done,
he has to call a notary, and deliver him the composition, with
orders to go into the personal presence of the offender, and
read it over to him, and take written note of his reply.
The notary's business is to reduce the mutual <HI>scolding</HI> into the
form of a regular <HI>instrument,</HI> which his employer shall lay
by, to be carefully kept among the archives of his family,
as a vindication of his honour.</P>
<P>WHERE it happens that a person has not exactly been able
to observe this prudent rule, but has taken the more obvious,
though irregular and blameable method, of immediate and
personal correction; the law, though it cannot entirely
pardon his wrong, will however, within proper bounds, have
consideration of this excuse, and mitigate the sentence;
especially if the reproof is not excessive, but in proportion
to the insult, and if the prosecution is for damages to the pri∣vate
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
party, who has in a manner courted the injury of which
he complains. The interlocutor is to that effect in the noted
case of Alexander Lockhart in June 1746<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the libel relevant to infer the pains of law; but for <HI>alleviating</HI> there∣of, allow the pannel to prove all facts and circumstances that happened <HI>the day that the criminal facts libelled are charged to have been committed;</HI> as also, the declaration of the pursuer some days before, that he would continue his resi∣dence in the Plewlands, purposely to catch an opportunity of picking a quarrel with the pannel, and to be a thorn in his side, or words to that purpose.” The interlocutor is not correctly given by Maclaurin.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 51. June 16. &amp; 23.</NOTE> For there the
defence is laid on the provocation of abusive and re∣proachful

<P>IT is implied in what has been said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Retortion of Blows; if a good Plea.</NOTE> that the defence of
provocation by real injuries suffered in the person, is subject
to a different construction, and may not only mitigate the
sentence, but elide the libel, and amount to an entire jus∣tification
of the violence. I may here appeal (if there
is any need of quoting precedents in confirmation of a
rule which is so obviously necessary), to the interlocutors of
relevancy in the following cases; John Murray, August

Campbell, January 2. 1710; John Higgins, July 1. 1723;
Conhoun and Buntine, December 26. 1727<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords found, that the saids pannels, or either of them, at the time and place libelled, with others in company with them, having with stroaks beat down to the ground the saids John Campbell and John Ewing, or either of them, to the danger of their lives or effusion of their blood, or that they the pannels, or either of them, were art and part thereof, relevant to infer an ar∣bitrary punishment; <HI>but for eliding thereof,</HI> sustained this defence relevant, viz.

it proven that Captain Robert Seton pannel, beat Captain
Walter Hamilton of Westport pursuer, and also found it
proven, that the said Captain Walter Hamilton beat Cap∣tain
Robert Seton first;” the Court straightway assoilzied
the pannel. I shall mention one other apt illustration;
the process of suspension,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 4. 1738.</NOTE> pursued by John and William
Macindassanach, of a sentence of the Bailies of Inverness.
The Court in this case “allowed a proof as to this reason of
suspension, that he offered to prove in Court, that Angus
Macintosh pursuer was the first aggressor, by beating and
kicking John Macindassanach, and that the said defence
was offered in Court by the procurator for the suspenders,
which was refused to be sustained, or to be marked in the
minutes.” A proof was taken in terms of this interlocu∣tor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 26. 1739.</NOTE>
at advising which the defence was found to be proved,
the sentence of the Bailies declared iniquitous and suspend∣ed,
and the original prosecutor condemned in costs<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">July 23. 1744, in the case of Macculloch, Wilson, and others, <HI>absolvitor</HI> followed on this verdict, “Find that James Wilson and John Rorieson, King's boatmen, did beat and wound Ewan Macneal, late mariner in Ramsay, &amp;c. to the effusion of his blood; but find sufficient provocation given by the said pursuer to the said pannels.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
IT is farther to be understood, that in deciding on pleas
of this sort, the Judge will not insist on an exact measure
and proportion of injury and retaliation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the due Mea∣sure of Retalia∣tion.</NOTE> but rather be dis∣posed
to sustain the defence, unless the pannel has been
transported to acts of cruelty or great excess. Which is the
just and proper rule; not only because allowance must be
had of the heat of blood on such occasions, when there
is no time for reflection, but also because the retaliation is
intended as well to deter from any prosecution of the assault,
as to punish for the violence already sustained; and this effect
it can only have, if it carry evidence both of resentment
and resolution. But if the due measure be exceeded, as by
continuing to beat the aggressor after he has been disabled,
or has submitted, or by seeking a powerful or mortal weapon
to be used against a weaker, or in general by pushing the
advantage of strength, or other advantage, to the utmost;
here the defence degenerates into an aggression, and
the sufferer, though he was provoker of the quarrel, shall ne∣vertheless
have his claim of <HI>solatium</HI> for the wrong. The
interlocutor proceeds on this principle, in the case of Fran∣cis
Charteris<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel against Captain Charteris relevant in these terms, viz. That he beat the pursuer on head and shoulders with the shaft or big end of a horse-whip, or that he dragged her along the streets by the hair of the head, or that he gave her a deep cut on the head with a sword, relevant to in∣fer an arbitrary punishment; and find the defence proponed for Captain Char∣teris, viz. That he was coming from his country-house about eleven or twelve of clock at night, and at that time he met the pursuer coming out of a tavern in the Canongate, and that she attacked him with opprobrious language, and gave him a box on the ear, and laid hold on his gravat, and offered to lay hands on his sword, swearing that she would stick him, relevant <HI>to elide the li∣bel, except as to the wounding her with the sword.</HI> Aug. 4. 1707.”</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 4. 1707. Aug. 8. 1732.</NOTE> and in that of Adamson and Ogilvy<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the said pannels, or either of them, their having, time and place libelled, beat, bruised, or wounded the complainers, or either of them, or their being art and part thereof, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; but <HI>for ending the same,</HI> in so far as concerns the injury done to George Home, find it relevant that the said George Home had a drawn cutlace in his hand, and therewith offered to strick the said pannels, or either of them, be∣fore the beating and bruising as aforesaid; <HI>but for elding the foresaid defence,</HI> sustained it relevant that the pannels, or either of them, did wound the com∣plainer <HI>with the cutlace they had taken from him, after he was beat down,</HI> or beat and bruised him <HI>to excess,</HI> in manner libelled. August 15. 1732.”</NOTE>. In
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
like manner, Alexander Haliburton was fined, notwithstand∣ing
a verdict which found in his favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. II. &amp; 17. 1705.</NOTE> “That the pannel
had met with some provocation, he being thrust out of
the room, and seen on the ground by all the witnesses.”
But he had taken severe revenge by striking on the head,
and thrusting in the mouth and throat, with a staff shod with
iron.</P>
<P>IT would be easy to lengthen this article, (and some of
the foreign doctors have not failed to enlarge on it), by
feigning cases of mutual and successive faults of the two
parties in a continued fray, and attempting to weigh their
excesses against each other. But truly this is an unprofitable
discussion. The general rule being once announced, that the
person invaded must keep within the bounds of an allowable
resentment; to apply this to any case which may happen
is matter of common sense, in which little aid will be deri∣ved
from any thing that books can teach upon the subject.</P>
<P>IT will, however, be proper to add a word or two con∣cerning
one circumstance more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provocation must be recent.</NOTE> which, equally as that
which last we considered, invalidates the defence of pro∣vocation;
and this is, if the provocation be not recent.
For, if the law in any case allows retaliation, it is still
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
with reluctance, and out of necessary compassion only for the
frailty of human nature, which is apt to be surprised and
overborn by the heat of blood, upon sudden injury to the
person. In no case, therefore, will it pardon an assault which
is only made <HI>ex intervallo,</HI> after lapse of a sufficient time for
reason to resume her seat. For such a deed does not savour of
passion, nor of human infirmity, but of enmity and revenge,
treasured up and increased by the concealment; a disposi∣tion,
which instead of excusing, the Judge will stigmatize and
reprove, as subversive of all the principles by which man∣kind
in a state of social union are connected.</P>
<P>THIS anxiety cannot indeed be carried so far, as absolute∣ly,
and in every instance, to exclude all regard to any
thing which has passed before the time of the assault. There
is a certain latitude in the construction even of the term
<HI>ex incontinenti</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“<HI>Dictio</HI> incontinenti non praecise de momento temporis est intelligenda, sed cum aliquo spatio temporis accipienda; quod neque maximum neque minimum sit, et quod magis intellectu percipi quam elocutione exprimi possit.” Carpso∣vius, Pars 1. Quaest. 31. No. 10.</NOTE>, such as will admit it to alleviate, if up∣on
the whole circumstances of the situation, the pannel is
in excusable heat of blood when he invades, though the
provocation be not received at that hour, and upon the spot.
Accordingly, to <HI>extenuate</HI> the guilt of an assault made in
the evening, Mr Lockhart was allowed to prove provocation
received from the prosecutor in the morning of the same
day<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In Maclaurin's report of this case, the assault is stated as made upon the 6th of May, and the provocation as received upon the 4th. But this is a mistake. The provocation and the assault are stated in the libel and informations, as on the morning and evening of the 4th of May. And the interlocutor limits the proof, (with one exception), to what happened <HI>on the day of the assault.</HI></NOTE>; this being the first occasion of their meeting after
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
the insult in the morning; at which time the pannel was re∣strained
from resenting, by the presence of his wife and daugh∣ter.
But farther than has now been said, no plea of this kind
can well be carried in favour of the assailant. As indeed, if
admitted with a greater latitude in point of time, the defence
at bottom would resolve into that of enmity or grudge be∣tween
the parties; which is no excuse for a deliberate injury
and breach of the peace, and for this, if for no other reason,
cannot be sustained, that the proof and history of such feuds
would swell out of all manageable bounds, and in most instan∣ces
would only issue in establishing the mutual intemperance
of the parties. In the case already mentioned, of Hume and
Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 30. 1744.</NOTE> an attempt was made to introduce such a proof into
the trial; but without success. Justice had pleaded, that
from the 26th to the 28th of December, the day of the as∣sault,
the prosecutor, Simpson, had been using means to do
him personal harm, and for decoying him into a situation of
danger, where he might safely be abused: He farther set forth
a long train of provocation, by advances made on the part of
Simpson to his wife, false stories carried to her to breed jea∣lousy
and disquiet between them, and other the like unneigh∣bourly
proceedings. Now, the interlocutor limited the proof
to those things which happened on the two days preceding the
assault<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 30. 1744, “Find the libel relevant to infer the pains of law, damages and expences; but for <HI>alleviating</HI> thereof, allow the pannels to prove the facts and circumstances alleged by them to have happened on the 26th December last, and thereafter until the time that the said crime is charged to have been committed.”</NOTE>, and which tended to raise suspicion of some undue
purpose on the prosecutor's part. The like defence, plead∣ed
for Alexander Paterson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1790.</NOTE> was equally unsuccessful. This
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
pannel alleged a series of provocation by personal rudeness
to himself, and to a woman who was under his protection;
by partial and oppressive proceedings at law, and by such im∣putations
in the course of these as were highly injurious to
his fame. But these allegations the Court found “not re∣levant
either to alleviate or exculpate.” In the case of
Mr Lockhart, the like detail was given of ill-tempered and
malicious conduct continued by the prosecutor for a course
of time: But here also the proof was confined to those things
which happened on the day of the assault, and to the pro∣secutor's
previous declaration of his purpose to molest and
harrass the pannel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">June 23. 1746, “Find the libel relevant to infer the pains of law; but for <HI>alleviating</HI> thereof, allow the pannel to prove all facts and circumstances that happened <HI>the day</HI> that the criminal facts libelled are charged to have been com∣mitted; as also, the declaration of the pursuer some days before, that he would continue his residence in the Plewlands, purposely to catch an opportunity of picking a quarrel with the pannel, and to be a thorn in his side, or words to that purpose.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>9. THE ways of excluding process for real injury are said
to be two;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Process for real Injury, how ex∣cluded.</NOTE> by remission, and by prescription; which last may
be considered as a remission implied from the silence of the
party lesed. But though it may seem likely, that these equi∣table
doctrines shall be received as part of our law; yet I
have found no instance of the application of them in prac∣tice,
from which to state either the particular period of taci∣turnity
that shall be held to be sufficient, or the mode and form
of the remission, whether it must be in writing, or may also
be made in words, if serious and explicit. As to the latter ar∣ticle,
a different decision may probably be given, according
to the degree and atrocity of the wrong. Those which con∣sist
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
in mere contumely or insult, may the more easily be abo∣lished;
perhaps by formal asking and receiving of pardon,
in presence of the common friends of the parties. But in re∣gard
to such whereby any great distress or damage has been
sustained, it may be more doubtful whether any thing less
than a written discharge or a bargain implemented on one
side, is sufficient to extinguish the right of prosecution for
them; seeing the claim is of as much importance as many
others, which require that mode of acquittance. This, at
any rate, is settled, that remission of any the more atrocious
injuries is not to be inferred from the meeting of the par∣ties
at table, their familiar conversation, or occasional so∣ciety,
or other the like appearances of reconciliation. These
may be very fallacious, and at most only go to shew that
there was once a disposition or purpose to forgive; a pur∣pose,
which until it be carried into effect in some more de∣finite
and business-like form, the party injured may alter at
his pleasure. The whole defences were repelled in the fol∣lowing
cases, notwithstanding the pannel's allegation of
friendly and convivial meetings with the prosecutor, of pro∣fessions
tending towards reconcilement, and even, in one in∣stance,
of good offices done the pannel in a situation of
distress; the case of James Campbell, January 8. 1722; of
Douglas of Broughton, January 1725; and Baillie and Tor∣rence,
March 8. 1726.</P>
<P>IN the second of these cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitation of Process for real Injury.</NOTE> after debate upon the point,
action was sustained at the distance of more than a year from
the time of the assault. A year, by the Roman law, appears
to have been the limited period of the Praetorian and civil
action, in which the party sued upon any, either verbal or
real injury, <HI>ad id quanti quisque injuriam aestimaverit:</HI> But it
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
does not appear that the same limitation applied to the pro∣per
criminal action, laid for real injuries, upon the <HI>Lex Cor∣nelia.</HI>
With us, of Scotland, a distinction may perhaps
be observed in this respect, between the greater and lesser
injuries, and even between the action of the private party,
and that of the Lord Advocate; of whom it will be presu∣med,
that he prosecutes as soon as his information enables
him, and circumstances make it proper. It is certain,
that within the period, (when it shall be settled), which
is allowed that officer to prosecute for such violations of
the public peace, his right is independent of even the most
express remission by the party lesed, and much more of any
implied forgiveness or dereliction. Judgment was given
to that effect, in the case of Ensign Beaver, in Feb. 1719.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this discourse concerning <HI>invasion</HI> or <HI>as∣sault,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Charge of Oppression.</NOTE>
it may be fit to mention, that beside these, and sundry
other appellations, under which a real injury may properly
be charged, there is one more, not quite so suitable, that of
<HI>oppression,</HI> which, by the older style, was often introdu∣ced
into the libel. The just application of this term is in
dittay against magistrates, officers of the law, or other
persons in situations of authority, for the abuse and per∣version
of their office, or in the case of private persons, for
vexatious and violent proceedings under the form and colour
of law. But instead of being confined to these, its proper
objects, it had in practice come to be applied to a great va∣riety
of other cases, as among private individuals, where
there was no pretence of any bond of dependence or subjec∣tion.
And in particular this often happened in cases of per∣sonal
violence or beating; witness the libel against Duff of
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
Braco, August 6. 1707; against Donald Macpherson, Februa∣ry
11. 1712; against John Douglas, January 11. 1725; against
Walter Hamilton, June 18. 1722.</P>
<P>AGAIN; it was not unusual, that between neighbours who
had quarrelled, a number of petty wrongs and molestations,
as well with respect to property as person, and each in itself
very inconsiderable, were gathered into one libel, and in∣sisted
on as <HI>separatim</HI> relevant, or, <HI>at least,</HI> “taken jointly, as
relevant to infer the generick crime of oppression.” The
charge in the case of Irvine of Gribtown, seems,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 29. 1718.</NOTE> in a great
measure, to have been of this description. But indeed,
there was hardly any thing of a nature so remote from the
proper colour of this charge, as not occasionally to be made
the subject of it. A controversy about the poinding of
sheep, (as in the case of Campbell of Succoth, June 30. 1712);
or about the raising of turf in a muir, or peats in a moss, (as
in the mutual libels between Stuart of Castlehill and Lesly
of Bardonside);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 18. 1717.</NOTE> this, or any the like patrimonial debate,
which had given rise to a brawl or disorder, was reputed to
be a just ground of libel for <HI>oppression.</HI></P>
<P>IN many instances, the charge was, however, found ir∣relevant;
and sometimes the course was, that the process
was sisted till decision of the fundamental point of civil right.
It is a mark of the better temper, and improved manners of
later times, that the use of this high term, and indeed the
fashion of criminal process upon such captious grounds, seems
to have entirely passed away.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70"/>
I HERE close my inquiry concerning offences against the
person. It is true, that the crime of wrongous imprison∣ment
also may be considered as belonging to the same class;
but the most important part of the doctrine on that head, is
so interwoven with the law respecting the <HI>prosecution and trial
of crimes,</HI> that I judge it better to reserve the whole, as an
article to be considered, (if I shall find leisure for such an
undertaking), under that division of the subject.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF OFFENCES AGAINST REPUTATION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now said as much as I think necessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X.</NOTE> concerning
the different kinds and degrees of real injury. The
other class of injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verbal Injuries, if actionable in the Justiciary.</NOTE> which are named Verbal, (by reason of
the forms of s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaking and writing, in which they are commit∣ted),
though in some instances more distressing than violence
inflicted on the person, and for the most part far more desti∣tute
of excuse on the part of the offender, have however, in
comparison of the former, very seldom been prosecuted in the
Criminal Court. The reason may be, that they are so various
in kind and degree; and that there is another Court, that of
the Commissaries, in which the reparation, ordinarily the most
suitable to this sort of injury, and the most acceptable to the
par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y injured, reparation by fine, palinode, and damages, can
with less expence and trouble be obtained. For the same rea∣son,
and to hinder individuals from molesting each other up∣on
trivial occasions, it has justly been held that the Lords of
J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sticiary have a discretionary power, of considering with re∣spect
to any case of this sort which is brought before them,
whether it be of that importance which requires the interpo∣sition
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
of their authority, or be more fit for the cognisance of
the Commissaries or other Judges. Mackenzie, in treat∣ing
of verbal injury<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">B. 1. Tit. 30. No. 4.</NOTE>, by which he understands spoken in∣jury,
has even said, that the Court of Justiciary will not in
any case sustain action for it, when committed against a
private person; and he mentions a decision to that effect,
(though without a date), which was given upon libel at in∣stance
of a minister against one who had accused him of
perjury. The case alluded to is probably that of Andrew
Straiton against David Doig, of the 17th February 1673;
but instead of authorising the inference which that author
has made from it, the decision seems rather to be an argu∣ment
for that discretionary power of the Court to which
I have alluded. It is in these words: “The Lords fand,
<HI>that this cause is not of that nature that it needs to be discussed
before this Supreme Court,</HI> and therefore deserts the diet,
and leaves the pursuer to pursue before the inferior judge
competent.” Nevertheless, the rule delivered by Mac∣kenzie
is certainly that which their Lordships will in ge∣neral,
and for the reasons above mentioned, be disposed
to follow, with respect to a spoken, or even a written injury,
directed against a person in his private capacity only.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the information which is to be got on this
head from the records, the cases of slander, whether written
or spoken, which shall clearly be held relevant, and fit for
the cognisance of the Supreme Court, are chiefly of the
following descriptions; though I do not mean to affirm
that future practice shall make no addition to them.</P>
<P>1. IT is an undoubted point of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slandering of Judges.</NOTE> and shall be treated
more at large in another place, as an offence against the
course of justice, to defame, or, as it is termed in our an∣cient
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
laws, <HI>to murmur,</HI> any Magistrate or Judge, by charging
him, whether in words or writing, with corruption, par∣tiality,
oppression, or failure of duty in his station. For this
is an offence, not more interesting to the person slandered,
than to the public, who have the deepest concern in main∣taining
the opinion of his pure and conscientious administra∣tion
of his office.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER undoubted instance is the calumnious prosecu∣tion
of a crime;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious Pur∣suit for a Crime.</NOTE> an injury whereof the redress is naturally
sought from that tribunal in which the prejudice was attempt∣ed
to be done the complainer, and which indeed is in some
measure itself insulted in the purpose to impose on its justice
and discernment; as well as that the wrong in such a case is
not a pure slander, or injury to fame, but also in some sense a
real injury, as tending to endanger the accused in law, and
to put him in fear of the issue. There are, accordingly,
in the books of adjournal, several instances of libel of recri∣mination,
raised by a pannel against his prosecutor for ca∣lumny
and defamation; though few of them seem to have
been so well grounded in the circumstances of the first pro∣secution,
on which depends the relevancy of these counter li∣bels,
as to be followed with, or to be entitled to success. None
of them are, however, dismissed as incompetent, but as irre∣levant
only. Such was the judgment on the libel of recri∣mination,
at instance of Sir William Gordon against Lu∣dovick
Gordon<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">February 9. 1713. “Find the other part of the libel, relative to Ludo∣vick's raising of calumnious complaints against Sir William, <HI>not relevant, as a libel in this instance.”</HI></NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9. 1713.</NOTE> on that at instance of James Sands and
others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. 1712.</NOTE> against Catharine Brown, occasioned by a charge of
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
reset of theft, which she had brought against certain cler∣gymen,
before the Justices of the Peace for Orkney; and
on that at instance of Francis Charteris against Andrew
Johnston, December 23. 1706<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“The Lords repel the haill allegeances and defences, proponed for the said Captain Francis Charteris, and the haill grounds of recrimination.”</P>
<P>In the case of Duff of Braco against James Gordon, the interlecutor was given, November 17. 1707. “Find the principal libel not relevant, and therefore as∣soilzie Braco; and in regard the pursuer in the recrimination past therefrom, therefore assoilzie Gordon.”</P></NOTE>. One instance, however,
there is of conviction on such a ground, in the proceedings
between Brisbane of Selvilands on the one part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. 7. 8. 1704.</NOTE> and Houston
of Johnston, and Walkinshaw <HI>junior</HI> of that Ilk, on the
other; whom Brisbane, somewhat rashly, had prosecuted
for house-breaking and Stouthrief. These pannels called
Brisbane in a counter action, for the malicious defama∣tion
of his Majesty's lieges; and this the Court “found re∣levant
to infer an arbitrary punishment, in case the pur∣suer
Selviland succumb in the probation of his libel.”
Both libels were sent to one assize; and the issue was, that
a clear <HI>alibi</HI> being proved on the part of Houston and Walkin∣shaw,
they were assoilzied from Brisbane's charge, and had
decree against him for 400 merks of damages and fine.</P>
<P>3. A THIRD ground of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious In∣formation of a Crime.</NOTE> and nearly allied to the last, is
the calumnious <HI>information</HI> of a crime, or the industriously pro∣pagating
against any one, in either a spoken or written form,
the false charge of a particular criminal act. In itself, this is
a far more serious and prejudicial sort of slander than the using
of reproachful, but loose and general appellations, such as
thief, adulterer, and the like, which seems to be a fitter sub∣ject
of process in the Civil Court; if even there such abuse
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
is to be sustained as a ground of action, when thrown out
passionately, and without allusion to any special occurrence.
But on the former and more interesting ground, there is
an instance of criminal pursuit sustained: I allude to the
prosecution at instance of Sir Alexander Rigby against
Mary Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. and Aug. 1. 1710.</NOTE>, Charles Isaackson and others; against
her, for accusing him in a written declaration, and against
the others, for corrupting her to accuse him of adulte∣ry,
(he being a married man), and as the father of her
bastard child. The libel bore a charge of <HI>defamation</HI> and
<HI>prevarication,</HI> (for at first she had fixed on Isaackson as
her paramour), and was found relevant to infer an arbi∣trary
punishment;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>August 1. 1710. “The Lords found Mary Hamilton, pannel, her having, in the pangs of child-birth, and before the kirk-session of Edinburgh or Canon∣gate, declared that Mr Isaackson was the father of her child; and afterwards, for money or other reward, retracting the said declaration, and giving out Sir Alexander Rigby, pursuer, to be the father, relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment.”</P>
<P>The major proposition of the libel states, among other crimes, “the wilful and malicious slandering, and detracting from the fame, good name, and repu∣tation, of any of her Majesty's lieges.”</P></NOTE>; but the action was not prosecuted to an issue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 3. June 12. 26. 27. and July 3. 1710.</NOTE> There is another precedent to the same pur∣pose,
in the mutual actions between Ferguson of Auchin∣blaine
Sheriff-depute of Ayrshire, and Kennedy of Dalar∣roch,
an heritor in that county. Ferguson, as Sheriff, had
made presentment of Kennedy, to be tried on the Justice
Aire, for stellionate and oppression. In retaliation of this
injury (as he pretended to consider it), Kennedy composed a
false indictment against the Sheriff, bearing charge of oppres∣sion,
perjury, adultery, Sabbath-breaking, and forgery; and
this dittay, which never was meant to be brought before any
Judge, he had printed and industriously dispersed, along with
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
a pretended answer by Kennedy to the charge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">VERBAL INJURIES.</NOTE> For this,
equally malicious and indecent calumny, which was a false
and public accusation of high crimes, in a shape as if depend∣ing
in a Court of Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 12. 1710.</NOTE> Ferguson pursued Kennedy; as
Kennedy on the other hand pursued Ferguson, on account of
his alleged calumnious presentment. In truth Kennedy had
taken the benefit of an act of indemnity, to avoid trial of
the very charges contained in the presentment; and his li∣bel
in consequence was found irrelevant. The other was
sustained to infer an arbitrary punishment and damages.
And Kennedy, being convicted, had sentence to pay a fine of
L. 1000 Scots, and to apppear and acknowledge his fault, first
before the Lords of Justiciary, and afterwards to Ferguson,
sitting in judgment in his own Court.</P>
<P>THE malice of the offender in this instance was evident in
the whole circumstances of the story.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calumnious In∣formation of a Crime.</NOTE> And in general
the criminal prosecution is herein distinguished from the
civil action for damages, that the <HI>animus injuriandi,</HI> or spe∣cial
malice of the deed must be shown, to warrant the in∣flicting
of a punishment; whereas mere petulance or indis∣cretion
may be the just ground of decree for reparation in the
other, though the parties be not even known to each other,
if the things said are in themselves of an injurious tendency
with respect to the pursuer. It was for a defect in this qua∣lity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1714.</NOTE>
that judgment was given dismissing the libel at instance
of Andrew Husband against John Russell;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">March 16. 1714. “The Lords found, that the pannel's taking out a war∣rant to apprehend the pursuer, upon an information signed by the said pannel, for the crimes therein objected against the pursuer, and the pannel's not having yet insisted therein, and no other circumstances being libelled to infer calumny, is not sufficient to infer the same; and therefore, found the libel not relevant.”</NOTE>; the ground
of the charge of calumny being only this, that Russell had
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
informed against, and got warrant to apprehend Husband,
on suspicion of having set fire to his barn-yard; but which
warrant was not executed; neither was the Charge made
without some cause of suspicion, nor industriously publish∣ed
to the world. In the action pursued by James Sands
and John Keith against Catharine Brown, for a calumnious
charge of the reset of a stolen ewe, by her exhibited to the
Justices of the Peace for Orkney, and on which she had
been successful in obtaining a decree, the Court, on the 1st
August 1712, “found, That the Justices of Peace having
sustained her complaint, she cannot be accused of a calum∣ny.”
But this judgment, though it was probably right in
the particular instance, is scarcely to be received as a rule for
future cases of the kind; since it is possible that the informer
may impose on the Judge, and even that the Judge may be
in league with the informer, to do injustice; which indeed
was the allegation, (but found to be groundless), in this very
case, where the Justices, as well as Catharine Brown, were
indicted for calumny and oppression.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Baikie of Tankerness, Moodie of Melsetter, and other Justices, were pan∣nelled along with her, not only for that article, but also on account of certain let∣ters written with respect to the pursuers, in which they termed them “giddy headed gospel-mongers, detracting little fellows, and persons fit to be kept down by all who were in power.” These being private and confidential letters, with the exception of one which had been shown and produced on some occasion, the Court, (August 1. 1712). found, “That the expressions in the said letters are not relevant to infer a crime, except the letter directed to Graemesay, dated the 25th March 1708, which being before the indemnity, sustain the said indemnity to exclude the same.” The diet was afterwards deserted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>4. THE only other case in which I find that libel has
been sustained for injurious words thrown out against an indi∣vidual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander mixed with Violence</NOTE>
is that of words uttered in presence of the complainer;
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
and attended with such circumstances of rage and disturb∣ance,
as justly to alarm with the fear of farther mis∣chief;
so that the offence is not a pure slander, but has in
it a mixture of violence, and a tendency towards a real
assault. The libel at instance of Elizabeth Hamilton, Lady
St Foord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1708. Jan. 1709.</NOTE> against Patrick Gordon, bore, among other char∣ges,
one of this complexion. It related, that Gordon ha∣ving
gone to the Lady's house at the head of an armed
party, and having spuilzied certain goods which she had
recently poinded from him, he at the same time insulted her
with many foul names, (such as <HI>common whore, adulterous bitch,</HI>
and the like), and threw out a false charge against her, of
having born a bastard in England; threatening her also with
blows, if she should presume to answer. Now, taken in all
its circumstances, this was a charge of both violence and
slander, each aggravated by the other. These reproaches were
found <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“The Lords sustain the libel against Patrick Gordon, &amp;c. That they did invade the house of St Foord, &amp;c.; <HI>or</HI> that the said Captain Patrick Gordon, when the messenger touched him with his wand of peace, by virtue of a cap∣tion at the Lady's instance, used and emitted the threatening expressions libel∣led, after the messenger had exhibited and intimate to him the off-taking of the sist on his bill of suspension; <HI>or</HI> that the pannels did spuilzie and away-take the goods libelled, after they were apprized at the market-cross of Coupar, and delivered to the Lady, and in her possession for several days at Earlshall; <HI>or that the said Patrick used and emitted the injurious expressions against the La∣dy in manner libelled,</HI> each of them, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” December 20. 1708.</P>
<P>In the case of James Abercromby and others, this interlocutor was given on the 8th March 1722. “Find, That James Abercromby, pannel, at the time and place libelled, called Alexander Swinton, complainer, <HI>rogue, villain, and ras∣cal,</HI> or gave him other the like injurious names; and thereafter, on the fame day or night, the said pannel having, in the trance or entry of Mrs Orrock's house, met with the complainer, did there renew his foresaid injurious expres∣sions, and did give the complainer a blow on the head, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, damages and expences.” He was convicted to that ef∣fect, and decerned in payment of a fine and damages.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
and Gordon being convicted as well of this as of other inju∣ries,
had sentence of imprisonment, and to pay a fine and da∣mages.</P>
<P>THERE is an article of the same character in the interlo∣cutor
on the libel against William Maccaul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1714.</NOTE> merchant in
Leith, at instance of Basset Eids, surveyor of the customs,
for challenging him to fight, and other injurious behaviour:
“And, <HI>separatim,</HI> find the pannel, about the time libelled,
his insulting the pursuer when in the execution of his of∣fice,
by using injurious words, and taking him by the but∣ton
of his coat, or snatching at his face several times, re∣levant
to infer an arbitrary punishment.” The verdict
was in favour of the pannel.</P>
<P>5. I HAVE purposely reserved for the last place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander against the King.</NOTE> one other
kind of verbal injury, which deserves, and is clearly within
the cognisance of a criminal court, and is indeed an offence
of a higher class than any of those which have yet been
mentioned: I mean the crime of <HI>leasing-making,</HI> (as it is
termed in our statutes), or calumny directed against the
King.</P>
<P>THIS we find acknowledged as a point of dittay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> and rank∣ed
as a high transgression, as long ago as the time of Ro∣bert
I.; in one of whose statutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stat. 1ma, cap. 21.</NOTE> it is described in these
words: “<HI>Statuit et defendit dominus Rex quod nullus sit conspi∣rator
nec inventor narrationum, seu rumorum, per quos materia
discordiae poterit oriri, inter dominum regem et populum suum.”</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
The statute farther says, that the offender shall be imprison∣ed
until the King dispose of him according to his pleasure.</P>
<P>LEASING-MAKERS are characterised in the like terms
in the statute 1424, c. 43. as inventors and tellers of ru∣mours
“whilk may ingender discorde betwixt the King and
his people.” And it orders, “that they be challenged
be them that power hes, and tine life and gudes to the
King.”</P>
<P>THE next statute that relates to leasing-making,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> is the act
1540, c. 83. which ratifies the older laws on that head, and
declares, “That gif ony manner of person makis ony evil
information of his Hieness to his baronnes and lieges,
that they sall be punished in sick manner, and be the samin
paines, as they that makis leasinges to his Grace of his
Lords baronnes and lieges.” By the style of this statute,
one might be led to conjecture, that the original notion of
leasing-making was that of calumny carried to the King
against a subject; or at least that this was that mode of the
crime which had chiefly been considered in practice. But
more probably, it is only an awkwardness, (such as is
not uncommon in our statute-book), of the form of expres∣sion.
All the later laws are designed for protection of the
King.</P>
<P>THE act 1584,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> c. 134. ordains, “That nane of his sub∣jects,
&amp;c. shall presume or take upon hand, privatly or pub∣licly,
in sermones, declamationes, or familiar conferences,
to utter ony false, <HI>slanderous,</HI> and <HI>untrew</HI> speaches, to the
<HI>disdaine, reproche,</HI> and <HI>contempt</HI> of his Majesty, his Council
and proceedings, or to the <HI>dishonour,</HI> hurt, or prejudice of his
Hieness, his parents and progenitoures, or to meddle in the
affaires of his Hieness and his estaite, present, bygane,
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
and in time cuming, under the paines conteined in the actes
of Parliament against makers and tellers of leasinges, cer∣tifying
them that sall be tryed contraveners theirof, or that
hearis sik <HI>slanderous speeches,</HI> and reportis not the same
with diligence, the said paine sall be execute against them
with all rigour, in exemple of utheris.”</P>
<P>AND much to the same purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> the act 1585, c. 10. which
forbids any one “publicklie to declaime, or privatly to speake
or write any purpose of <HI>reproach</HI> or <HI>slander</HI> of his Majesty's
persone, estaite or governement, or to deprave his lawes and
actes of Parliament, or misconstrue his proceedinges, quair∣by
ony mislyking may be mooved betwixt his Hieness
and his nobilitie and loving subjectes in time cuming,
under the paine of death.” This statute, as we are in∣formed
by Spottiswood and Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Spottiswood's History, p. 243.; and Mackenzie's Observations on the Statutes, p. 217.</NOTE>, was made for re∣pressing
the intemperance of the clergy of that time, who had
indulged in violent sarcasm and invective against the King,
with relation to his laws for the government of the Church.</P>
<P>IN addition to this (certainly severe) ordinance, the act
1594, c. 209. after ratifying all former statutes, denoun∣ces
the same pains against “quhaever heares the saids
<HI>leesings, calumnies, or slanderous speeches,</HI> or writtes to be
made, and apprehends not the authors thereof, if it lyes
in his power, or reveilis not the same to his Hieness,” or
to some magistrate.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> the act 1609, c. 9. makes provision against
those who shall endeavour to raise discord between the
inhabitants of the two kingdoms, (at that time recently
united under one sovereign), by publishing or uttering of
writings or speeches, “to the slander or reproch of the
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
estate, people, or countrie of England, or dishonour or pre∣judice
of any Counseller of the said kingdome.” It orders
that the offenders in this sort shall be severely punished “in
their persons and goods, by imprisonment, banishment,
fyning, or mair rigorous corporal pain, as the qualitie of
the offence shall be found to merite, at his Majestie's
pleasure.”</P>
<P>THESE are the several enactments touching this crime of
leasing-making; which, though very fit to be sharply re∣proved,
was, however, too severely dealt with in being sub∣jected
to the pain of death, even if the Legislature had
employed more definite terms in describing the offence.</P>
<P>THE first step towards the correction of this rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Leasing-making.</NOTE> was
at the Revolution, when the Claim of Right, without directly
specifying, did in effect impugn these laws, in that article
which sets forth the grievance “of causing pursue and forfeit
persons upon <HI>stretches</HI> of old and obsolete laws, and upon
frivolous and weak pretences, &amp;c. as particularly the late
Earl of Argyle.” The result was the passing of the statute
1703, c. 4.; which, upon the narrative of the generality of
the said statutes, and the various constructions to which they
were liable, and the dangerous consequence of this <HI>as to the
capital punishment,</HI> relaxed their severity, and ordained, that
the punishment should for the future “only be arbitrary,
according to the demerit of the transgression, that is, by
fining, imprisonment, or banishment; or if the party offen∣der
be poor, and not able to pay a fine, then to be pu∣nished
in his body; life and limb always preserved.”</P>
<P>THE crime, therefore, and <HI>nomen juris,</HI> and the statutes in
relation to it, still remain a part of our system; though
these last are not now so likely to be used as grounds of
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
charge by themselves, as in confirmation of the common
law. I say in confirmation of the common law; for I think
it is not to be doubted, that the offence would have been
cognisable, and perhaps to the effect of inflicting as high
pains as those which are allowed in the act 1703, although
the Legislature had never interposed with any provision on
the subject.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the nature of the transgression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Crime.</NOTE> Accord∣ing
to the description given of it in the statutes, and the course
of practice by which they have been applied and explained,
it is a verbal injury levelled against the King, and which
is construed in the law to proceed out of malice and evil
disposition, entertained against him. Now, under this gene∣ral
account of it, two species of offensive act seem to be in∣cluded.
And in the first place, leasing-making may be com∣mitted
by the invention of such rumours, stories, and allega∣tions
with respect to his Majesty, as are to his prejudice or
dishonour, and in their consequences may tend to lessen his
estimation with his people, or to impair the good under∣standing
that is between them.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention calumnies of different kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leasing-making, by challenge of the King's Title.</NOTE> which
may serve to illustrate this branch of the subject. One
of the most undoubted instances, and which has more
frequently been exemplified than any other, is the spread∣ing
of such a report with respect to the King, as tends to
impeach his title to the throne; as if one should call the
King a bastard, or a Papist. Thus, on the 3d August 1596,
in virtue of the said statutes 1584, 1585, and 1594, which
are the grounds laid in the dittay, John Dickson in Lyn, an
Englishman, is convicted and doomed to die “for uttering
calumnious speeches and slanders against our Sovereign
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
Lord, and calling of him ane bastard.” To the same effect,
we have several instances of judgment since the accession of
the House of Brunswick to the throne, and these given upon
libels which either charge the offence as leasing-making, or
are laid upon the foresaid laws. One is the case of John
Grahame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 31. 1715.</NOTE> William Hogg and Alexander Crawford<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“That where by the laws of Scotland, made before the Union, particularly the 4th act of the 1st session of her late Majesty Queen Anne, of blessed me∣mory, her first Parliament, entitled, <HI>Act anent Leasing-makers,</HI> and the acts therein recited, and by the laws of all well governed nations, <HI>leasing-making,</HI> and the uttering <HI>of slanderous speeches,</HI> tending to excite sedition, and alienate the affection of the people from his Majesty's person and government, or to set up and encourage the false and scandalous pretensions of any person, to the pre∣judice of his Majesty, his estate, and his just and lawful title to the Crown of these realms, stirring up thereby his subjects to mislikings, sedition, and un∣quietness, and to cast off their obedience to his Majesty, to their evident peril, tinsel, and destruction, are crimes of a high nature,” &amp;c.</NOTE>; the last
of whom was convicted of drinking the health of James VIII.
and wishing his happy restoration, and had sentence to pay
a fine of L. 50.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27. and July 4. &amp; 5. 1715.</NOTE> Another is the case of Oliphant, Watson
and others, convicted on the like libel, of cursing King
George, and drinking the Pretender's health<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the course of the debate, the pursuer says, “That the giving the title of King to any person, implies likewise the asserting of his right; and that asser∣tion does again imply, that the rightful Sovereign has no right; than which there cannot be a more dangerous <HI>rumour and false slander,</HI> tending to sedition and stirring up the people to dislike of his Majesty's person and government.”</NOTE>, on his birth∣day,
under the style of James VIII. They were condemned
to various pains of fine, imprisonment, disfranchisement as
burgesses, and incapacity of office, according to the degree
of their respective faults.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 20. &amp; 31. 1718.</NOTE> In the case of Alexander Robert∣son,
and five others, the libel is in the same style; and rele∣vancy
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
is sustained on these grounds, or any of them, that
they drank the Pretender's health, or prayed for him by
the name of James VIII. or in other terms implying his
right to the sovereignty of these realms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Interlocutor:</HI> “Find Mr Robertson, his drinking the Pretender's health, at the time and place, and in terms libelled, or in words directly importing the same, relevant to infer an arbitrary pain; and found the said Messrs Robert∣son, Thomson, James and Francis Raits, or either of them, at any time since the act of grace, their praying for the Pretender by the name and title of King James VIII. or in the equivocal terms respectively libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P>
<P><HI>Major proposition of libel:</HI> “That whereas, by the laws of this realm, the <HI>crimes of leasing-making,</HI> uttering false and untrue speeches, tending to create jealousies between his Majesty and his subjects, to stir up sedition, and infuse in them a dislike of his Majesty's government and title to govern, the crimes of violence, riòt,” &amp;c.</P>
<P>Charges of the same sort were found relevant to infer arbitrary punishment, in the case of Gideon Guthrie, July 4. 18. 1715, who had sung disloyal songs, and drunk the health of the Pretender as James VIII. on his birth-day; and in that of Alexander Stewart, drover, July 18. 1715, who had in the streets declared himself for King James, and threatened others to do the like. But the libel, in both these instances, was laid without mention of leasing-making, or of the statutes.</P></NOTE> Along with
those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 3. 1712.</NOTE> we have to class the case of Mr James Dundas <HI>junior,</HI>
of Arniston, indicted for presenting one of the Pretender's
medals to the Faculty of Advocates, and holding speeches
there in recommendation of his title to the Crown, and
writing a pamphlet in the same strain, which, as the libel
says, “could not but be esteemed a most <HI>scandalous and per∣nicious
reproach</HI> upon us, our government, and right there∣to,
tending to engender discord between us and our people,
&amp;c.” The Lords found the libel relevant<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The libel is first laid upon the statutes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respecting leasing-making, viz. 1424, c. 43.–1540, c. 83–1584, c. 134.–1585, c. 10.–1594, c. 209.–1703, c. 4.; and then it proceeds thus: “And farther, by the common law, as well as by the foresaid laws and acts of Parliament, <HI>injuries, slanders, reproaches, and desama∣tion,</HI> to the engendering of discord between the King and his people, or to the occasioning of conspiracy against the Prince, or of sedition, or to the dishonour or hurt of his Highness; or to the moving mislike between his Highness and his subjects, may be done, perpetrate, and committed, not only by words and writing, and printing, but also by things themselves, as scandalous seditious, pernicious medals, pictures, and the like, with their disloyal and wicked in∣scriptions; and the actors and accessories to the said crimes so committed, ought to be severely punished by the pains of law.”</NOTE>, to infer an
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
arbitrary punishment; but the pannel went abroad, and the
charge was not prosecuted to any issue. In all these in∣stances,
the thing done was a plain impeachment of the
King's title, and the moving of such an opinion or rumour,
as was highly injurious and distressing to his Majesty, whom
it represented as an usurper, and tended to deprive of the
affections of his people.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mode of calumny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leasing-making, by Aspersion of the King's Cha∣racter.</NOTE> little less interesting to the
King, and which equally falls under the intendment of the
statutes, is the aspersion of his moral character, or the mis∣construing
and depraving of his public measures, and ad∣ministration
of the sovereignty. It would be an example
of the former, if any one should charge the King with adul∣tery,
or describe him as a common liar, or as addicted to
any other the like gross vice or mean habit, such as in the
case even of any of his subjects would be ground of action
of damages, and is to be considered in a far more serious
light in its application to the person of the King, by reason
of his high dignity, and the station of respect and honour
in which he is placed by the constitution, and on account of
the public interest in maintaining his personal character
and reputation; to the end he may fulfil his functions in
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
the State, and support the authority of the Crown. It would
be an example of the other, to accuse the King of a formed
purpose to break his coronation oath, and usurp on the other
members of the Legislature, or of turning aside the public
money from its proper uses into his private purse, or of
wasting it in vain pleasures, or in profuse gifts to greedy
and undeserving favourites; all of them charges both inju∣rious
to the honour, and painful to the feelings of the King,
and tending to withdraw from him the reverence of his
subjects.</P>
<P>ONE of the oldest trials of this class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leasing-making, by Aspersion of the King's Con∣duct. Oct. 8. 1600.</NOTE> is that of Francis
Tennant, who suffered death for writing under feigned
names, and laying down in one of the churches of Edin∣burgh,
two letters which contained slanderous calumnies
and reproaches to the dishonour of the King, his progeni∣tors,
Council, and proceedings. The letters themselves are
not in the record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There is this entry on the margin of the record: “<HI>Nota,</HI> Immediately af∣ter dome pronuncin, Mr Thomas Hamilton, (the Lord Advocate), tuik up the twa letters, writs, and pasquills, the ane direct to Mr Robert Bruce, and the uthir to Mr John Davison, ministers, whilk twa pasquills he wald not have inserted in the record;” probably on account of their indecency.</NOTE> but it may be gathered from the allu∣sions
to them in the entry of the dittay, which is laid upon
the statutes against leasing-makers, that they had slander∣ed
the King in both the ways above described. The next
instance is the trial of George Nicol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 1633.</NOTE> indicted on the same
statutes, for the malicious compiling of two papers, of
which one calumniated the King's Counsellors and great
officers, especially with respect to their dilapidation and
mismanagement of his revenue; and the other impeached the
King's own measures and proceedings. The Privy Council
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
took this trial into their own hands; and the culprit was sen∣tenced
to pillory and banishment.</P>
<P>SOON after this came the trial of Lord Balmerino,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leasing-making, by Aspersion of the King's Con∣duct.</NOTE> in 1635.
The libel against this nobleman was mainly laid on the act
1594, c. 209. <HI>anent leasing-makers,</HI> and charged him with
writing a wicked pamphlet against his Majesty's person and
government; at least with showing and divulging it to
others; at least with reading and hearing it, and knowing
the author, and neither taking him, nor revealing the of∣fence.
It appears that this composition was in the form of a
petition to the King, and that it contained an assemblage of
charges injurious to his character, and in misconstruction of
his proceedings. It related, that the King had by gesture,
and otherwise, taken note of, and shewn his displeasure at
certain persons, who opposed his measures in Parliament,
and especially his acts of Church-government; that he had
obstinately refused to listen to their reasons of dissent from
those acts; that he denied liberty of sitting upon the Commit∣tee
of Articles to some who had right to sit there, and admit∣ted
Papists, who had none. It proceeded to set forth, that his
taxes were heavy, and that the produce of them was not em∣ployed
to the public behoof, but lavished upon diverse per∣sons,
“whase <HI>wastrie</HI> and wants, your good subjects are not
obliged to supply.” This, (it adds), was contrary to the
promises contained in his proclamations, and speeches in
Parliament; and after complaining of his servants for mal∣administration
of the money, it concludes with reminding
him, that the pensions and salaries of office, (which had of
late been increased), were still as sufficient for the places,
as they had been in his father's time, and that none had
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
been found to refuse the places, by reason of the moderate
fees. This was the substance of the charge. The assize
“find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11. 1635.</NOTE> pronounce and declare, the said John Lord Balme∣rino
to be allenarly fyled and convict of the hearing the
said infamous libel, concealing and not revealing it.
Whereupon the Court find the said John, &amp;c. to have in∣curred
the pain of death, contained in the act 1594; but
suspends the execution thereof till such time as his Ma∣jesty's
gracious will and pleasure be shewn thereanent;
and order him to be remanded, in the mean time, to ward,
in the Castle of Edinburgh.”</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether I should next mention, (for it was a
plain perversion of these statutes or any of them), the case
of Archibald Earl of Argyle in December 1681; who had
judgment of death for adding this explanation, at taking the
test-oath,—That he took it as far as it was consistent with
itself, or with the Protestant religion. This, by a most
violent and unnatural construction, was wrested into a depra∣ving
of the King's laws and proceedings, contrary to the act
1585, c. 10.; as if the Earl had charged the King with the
imposing of contradictory oaths, and such as were hostile to
the Protestant faith<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See State Trials, vol. iii. p. 441.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAST of all, notice may be taken of the case of James Sands,
Thomas Baikie and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1712.</NOTE> who, among other misdemeanours,
were charged with leasing-making; in as much as in the course
of their sermons, they had indulged in an invective against
the Liturgy of the Church of England, (which they compared
to the worship of Baal), and had affirmed that the Tolera∣tion
Act was an infringement of the Claim of Right, and such
an ordinance as the Queen could not lawfully assent to, nor pass
into a law. The last part of this charge was found relevant
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
to infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“And as to the article against Mr Baikie, for reflecting on the Liturgy of the Church of England, find the same <HI>not relevant;</HI> and as to the article against Mr Baikie, for what he is alleged to have preached concerning the Toleration Act, find, that his using in the pulpit, when preaching to the people, the ex∣pressions libelled, or others directly, and not by inference, to the same import, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P>
<P>The libel begins thus: “Whereas, by the laws of God, the laws of this and all other well governed realms, habitual drunkenness, all blasphemy, &amp;c.—all undue and scandalous reflections cast upon the Government, or those entrusted in the management thereof; all leasing-making, and attempts of making divi∣sion and bad understanding betwixt the Sovereign and his subjects; all open robbery, &amp;c.”</P></NOTE>; but the pannels were not
convicted.</P>
<P>THERE is still one mode of calumny more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moving Jealou∣sy between the King and Nobles.</NOTE> which is re∣ferrible
to this first head of leasing-making, and was perhaps
in the beginning more regarded by the law than any of the
others. This is the false invention of stories and rela∣tions,
of a more special and private nature, such as may
tend to move misliking or jealousy between the King and
any of his Counsellors and servants, or other eminent or
powerful person in the State. For, beside the indignity offered
to the Sovereign, in the invention of any such falsehood with
respect to him, it had been considered of how much conse∣quence
it is, not only to the King personally, but to the State
and common weal, to maintain a due confidence and affection
between him and all such persons of influence in the coun∣try;
whereby not only ariseth a security for the continuance
of tranquillity, as far as concerns those persons themselves,
but for the zealous render of their services on occasions of dan∣ger
or commotion. In the state of Scotland in former times,
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
this was a consideration of still higher importance than it
is now.</P>
<P>THUS, falsely to report to any of the King's Council that
the King has called him a traitor, and is preparing to
take measures against him, or to such a Judge of the Su∣preme
Court, that the King has charged him with partiality
to traitors and corruption in his office; this would be leasing-making.
As, on the other side, it would equally amount to
that offence, in terms of the statute 1540, c. 83. if one
should carry to the King a false and malicious information
against such a Privy Counsellor or Officer of State, of his
being engaged in a traiterous correspondence with the
King's enemies, or having made an attempt on the ho∣nour
of his Consort, or any of his family. Not to mention
other very obvious reasons, which probably contributed to
the passing of that law; the evil was the same to the Prince,
of jealousy between him and his Nobles, in whichever way
of calumny it was stirred; and the mover of such lies might
justly be held to be equally the enemy of the King, whom
he disquieted by such information, and misled into suspi∣cion
of a good servant, as of the subject whom he thus
defamed.</P>
<P>THE record offers sundry prosecutions of this sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander of Nobles to the King.</NOTE> and
more than one conviction. On the 20th August 1618, Tho∣mas
Ross was convicted of leasing-making; having pub∣lished
and affixed at Oxford a pasquinade and invective
against the Scottish nation, wherein he exhorted the English
to drive them out of the realm, as a pernicious and unprofi∣table
race. It appears from the libel, which is laid on the fore∣said
statutes, that this satire had been taken up as especially
to the calumny and prejudice “of his Majestie's guid sub∣jectis
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
and servandis attendantis upon and about his Ma∣jestie's
Royal Persone and Court.” The author had sen∣tence
of death on the 10th of September 1618.</P>
<P>ON the 30th November 1631, James, Lord Ochiltree, was
accused at instance of the Lord Advocate for leasing-making
committed against James, Marquis of Hamilton, the Earl of
Melrose and others, by false information given of them to
the King, as engaged in some treasonable plot against him.
A learned debate took place upon this charge; but the mat∣ter
was not even prosecuted to the obtaining of a judgment
on the relevancy of the libel.</P>
<P>THE next in date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slander of Nobles to the King. July 21. 1641.</NOTE> and prosecuted with a more unrelenting
spirit, was the accusation of John Stuart, Commissary of Dun∣keld,
for leasing-making against the Earl of Argyle, in alleging
that the Earl had circulated and presented bonds to the lieges,
obliging them to follow him, without reservation of the King
or State. Stuart was convicted on this charge, and suffer∣ed
death. If, as the after events give reason to believe, this
unfortunate man only fell a victim for having done his
duty, and reporting the truth; his death was before long
avenged on the family of his accuser, whose descendant, as
we have seen, was himself, by an equally unjust sentence,
brought to the scaffold on a charge of leasing-making
against the King.</P>
<P>THE case of John Niven, is a third instance of prosecu∣tion
for calumny uttered against a subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1680.</NOTE> He was tried
for railing against the Duke of York, and accusing him of
a plot to kill the King, to combine with the French, and
introduce Popery. He had judgment of death; but it does
not appear that the sentence was put in execution.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93"/>
THE latest instance of this sort of prosecution is that of
David Baillie, who, on the 4th of February 1704, had sen∣tence
of pillory and banishment, upon trial before the Privy
Council, for leasing-making against the Duke of Queensberry
and the Marquis of Annandale.</P>
<P>THESE several examples may serve as illustrations of the
first and most genuine mode of our ancient offence of lea∣sing-making.</P>
<P>THE other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Railing or scof∣fing at the King.</NOTE> and perhaps more improper mode of it, (but
which also behoved to be known as a crime at common law),
embraced in general all words and speeches uttered to the
disdain, reproach, or contempt of the King; that is <HI>convi∣ciandi
animo,</HI> in a scoffing and railing manner, and to the
vituperation of that high Person. Hereunto are refer∣red
all such passionate and bitter speeches as indicate the
speaker's hatred of his Majesty, and all such foul, con∣tumelious,
and indecent language or behaviour with re∣spect
to him, as shews an utter disregard of his person and
station, and which, while it is in the very hearing of∣fensive
to the well disposed, so with the vulgar and unin∣formed,
it as naturally tends to the lessening of the due
reverence of his royal name and authority. For instance;
to curse the King, or drink to his perdition; or to pray or
wish for his death, or other great calamity to him; or to
make his Majesty the subject of vile and degrading songs, or of
odious pictures and devices; or to spit upon and trample un∣der
foot his proclamations or other his public acts, bearing
his subscription, or running in his name, if this is accompanied
with words of open contempt of him, his laws and man∣dates;
all these are instances of that mischievous and inde∣cent
<HI>vituperation</HI> of the King, which the law cannot pass over
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
unpunished, and to which, equally as to the invention of spe∣cial
reports and slanders with respect to him, it seems to
have been held, that the later statutes, in their general ex∣pressions
already quoted, intended to apply the sanction of
the highest pains. At least, I can find no other probable ground
in law, upon which the following convictions could proceed.
On the 17th May 1615, John Fleming had sentence of death
on a charge of publicly expressing his desire of the King's
death; having wished “that the King might shoot to dead
or the morn, and die of the falling sickness.”</P>
<P>ON the 4th December 1662, John Dobie, weaver in Glas∣gow,
was tried on a libel which is laid upon the act
1585, c. 10. and charges him with having expressed his hope
“to see the King pulled off the throne, and hanged along
with his whole party;” and also, with evil wishes against
the King's Commissioner, who was passing through the west
towards Galloway at the time. He was convicted on full
evidence; but I cannot find that any sentence ensued<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A case, in some measure allied to these, was that of Archibald Cornwall, who had sentence of death and <HI>forfeiture,</HI> April 25. 1601, for <HI>dishonouring and defaming</HI> his Majesty, by affixing his portrait to the posts of a gallows. But it ap∣pears from the sentence, and the expressions of the verdict, that this offence had been strained into a resemblance of treason. In the case of Fleming also, the speeches are styled “treasonable, blasphemous, and damnable speeches;” but there is no mention of forfeiture in the sentence.</NOTE>.
Even in such instances where those ultimate, and perhaps
unlawful conclusions were not insisted in, (I say unlawful,
because I think it may well be questioned whether any of the
foresaid statutes was intended to affix the pain of death to pure
scoffing and abuse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scoffing and rail∣ing at the King.</NOTE> without the invention of any slanderous
story), still the offence met with severe reprehension. Wit∣ness
the case of William Tweedie in Heugh Brae, March 11.
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
13. 1612<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The outset of the libel is thus: “For as meikle as it is statute and ordainit be dyverse actis of Parliament, as weil maid in his Hieness awin time, as in his Hieness predecessores time, that nae mannir of person presume, nor take upon hand to uttir or give out slanderous, reproachful, or treasonable speeches, outher be word or writ againis his Majestie, his Hieness Counsill, or nobility, under the paine of dead, as the saids actis at length beares; notwithstanding,” &amp;c. This is a plain libel on the statutes against leasing-makers, especially the act 1584, c. 134.</NOTE>, who being convicted of uttering certain slander∣ous,
reproachful, and irreverent speeches against the King
and his Council, such as decency forbids to record, had
sentence, with advice of the Privy Council, to be scourged
through Edinburgh, and to be banished the King's domi∣nions.
After the Revolution too, and the act of Anne,
which abolished the capital sanction, still it appears that the
charge of leasing-making was held to be applicable to such
cases of reproachful or contemptuous words, as were offen∣sive
to the King, and tended to lessen the honour of him
in the land. In the case, already mentioned, of Oli∣phant
and others<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Major proposition of libel: “That where by the laws of Scotland, made before the Union, particularly the 4th act of the 1st session of her Majesty Queen Anne, of blessed memory, her first Parliament, and by the laws of this and all well governed nations, <HI>leasing-making,</HI> and uttering of slanderous speeches, tending to excite sedition, and alienate the affections of our lieges from our Person and Government, or to set up and encourage the false and scandalous pretensions of any person to the prejudice of us, our estate, our just and lawful title to the Crown of these realms, stirring up thereby our subjects to misliking, sedition, and disobedience to our just authority.”</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27. and July 4. &amp; 5. 1715.</NOTE> the major proposition of the libel sets
forth chiefly the crime of leasing-making; and one of the
charges is the cursing of King George, which is found sepa∣rately
relevant, and goes to the assize, by whom Oliphant is
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
convicted; and in consequence he is fined, and disfranchi∣sed
as a burgess.</P>
<P>UPON the whole of these illustrations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Leasing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> the peculiar and
distinctive character of leasing-making appears to lie in this,
that it is a verbal injury directed against the King; pro∣ceeding,
or in the construction of law understood to pro∣ceed,
from evil disposition with respect to him, and intended
to do him prejudice as a person.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in their consequences, such misdemeanours
may often lead to the farther mischief of commotion or dis∣turbance
in the State; and certainly of all these practices
it may with justice be said, that by injuring the respect of
Majesty, and lessening the Sovereign in the esteem of his
subjects, they tend, less or more, to loosen the bonds of al∣legiance,
and to place the minds of men in that position,
where they may be susceptible of new impressions. Nor is
it to be doubted, (indeed in some of the statutes it is ex∣pressed),
that this was one reason among others, why a ver∣bal
injury levelled against that high personage was account∣ed
of a more heinous nature, and was more severely punished,
than in the case of an ordinary man. But, although leasing-making
may occasion such evil consequences, the legal notion
of that offence does not include any malicious purpose to
produce them. Its characteristic, or peculiar quality, and that
which distinguishes it from sedition, with which it has some∣times
been confounded, is, that the falsehood is not vented
<HI>eo intuitu,</HI>—with the purpose of unsettling the State,—nor ori∣ginates
in any high or formed project of that sort, but in the
malice only of the inventor towards the King as a person,
and has for its object to gratify the spleen and ill humour
with which the defamer is possessed in regard to him, or,
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
(if that may be), to molest and disquiet the King, and do him
an injury in his fame. When committed against his Majesty,
it is still a crime of the same class and character, as when
committed, (which according to the act 1540 it may equally
be), against any of his Counsellors or great Barons. And cer∣tainly
it will not be said of every slander or malicious tale
carried to the King of any of those persons, that it ne∣cessarily
implies a purpose to corrupt the loyalty of the
people, and breed disturbance in the State. This, therefore,
is one circumstance, (though apt to be overlooked, owing to
the long disuse of such prosecutions on the part of subjects),
which marks the just and peculiar character of leasing-making,
as a high and aggravated sort <HI>slander.</HI></P>
<P>IT is also in this respect distinguished from sedition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinciton of Leasing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> that
it always has relation to the King, or, (if that is not abolish∣ed
by long disuse), to some eminent individual connected
with the Court, and can only be committed by means of
false speeches, or reproachful and contemptuous words
thrown out against him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Skene, in his Treatise of Crimes, tit. 2. c. 12. No. 4. classes leasing-making as a species of the general crime of <HI>Falset.</HI></NOTE>. But sedition is a crime of a far wider
and more various description, as well as of a deeper character,
which may equally be committed in relation to any of the
other powers, orders, or parts of the public constitution of
the land, or to any class or division of the society of its in∣habitants,
and without the use of special calumnies or slan∣ders
against the King, or any other individual; as by the
forming of combinations, the taking of resolutions, the cir∣culation
of doctrines and opinion, or, in general, the pursuit
of any <HI>course of measures and actions,</HI> such as directly tends
to resistance of the Legislature or established Government,
or to the new modelling of the State without the authority of
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
law. No invective, therefore, how violent soever, against
monarchy in general, no abuse, the most outrageous, of the
British constitution, no proceedings, though ever so plainly
tending to abolish that venerable system, and set up a new
form of government in its room, would justify a charge of
leasing-making. Because, though all involving the state and
office of the King, as part of the constitution, such projects
are levelled against the whole system, and are not moved
out of special grudge to the Prince upon the throne, but
spring from a deeper and more malignant principle, as well
as employ more direct and more extensive means, than that
of mere slander of the person and conduct of the King.
Thus sedition is a proper crime against the State, and holds
the next place after treason, to which it is nearly allied,
and which it may often, hut by a short interval, precede.
The other is a personal offence or verbal injury offered to
the King, and which the law considers in so much a more
serious light than other injuries of that class, partly by rea∣son
of the just regard it has to the peace and tranquillity of
the Head of the State, the most eminent person in the land;
and partly by reason of the possible evil influence of such
an example on the affections and dispositions of his subjects.</P>
<P>IN some instances it may indeed be difficult to draw the line
between the two transgressions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Leasing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> but this no more hinders them
to be distinct, than in the case of forgery and falsehood, or of
theft, fraud, and breach of trust; charges which are still more
difficult to be distinguished by certain and palpable rules.
For instance, to curse the King and his race, and to pour
out slanders or reproaches and evil wishes against him,—
if it be done at the instant, by one who finds himself dis∣missed
from a lucrative office about the King's person, and
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
if it is accompanied with the ordinary symptoms of vexa∣tion
and disappointment; this effusion of ill temper, though
far from salutary to such as witness it, and certainly cog∣nisable
in a criminal court, is not, however, an act of proper
sedition. It is not a <HI>measure,</HI> taken to debauch the people
and disturb the State, but a pure injury to the King; a con∣tempt
and reproach, (<HI>convicium</HI>), directed against him, and
uttered out of dislike of his Majesty as a person, or to sa∣tisfy
the spleen and rancour of the speaker. But if, (as in
the case of Craig,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8. 1793.</NOTE> Morton, and others), the like practice is
detected at a period which teems with projects of change,
and in persons who are found to have entered one of the
King's garrisons, and there, in presence of the King's sol∣diers,
to have drunk perdition to the King and his race, <HI>and
to all crowned heads,</HI> and to have accompanied this impious
wish with promises and insinuations of advantage to the sol∣diers,
if they will betray the King, or with such discour∣ses
as are plainly calculated to shake their fidelity; then
this same fundamental act, thus qualified and expounded,
is no longer a bare contumely or indecency, (as in the case
of Fleming, or of Oliphant), but an act of palpable and
real sedition,—an attempt and measure to corrupt the forces
of the State, and deprive it of its means of defence against
tumult and insurrection.</P>
<P>AGAIN;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Leasing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> let us imagine a time, so profligate as to produce
a satire on the Royal Family, full of personal reproach and
obloquy to the King, his progenitors and race. Let us sup∣pose
it to describe them as destitute of all the virtues of their
station, and addicted to the vices and the pleasures of the
lowest of the people; and that in support of this invective,
the libel proceeds with a false narrative of sundry inci∣dents
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
in the King's household, or family-concerns. Wicked
and abominable as such a composition is; yet if it be en∣tirely
of this slanderous description, and neither is mingled
with observations and inferences of a political nature, nor
can from circumstances be shewn to have been calculated
for any purpose of public commotion, and especially if it
can be traced to any cause of personal quarrel with any of
the Royal Family; it still does not amount to the State crime
of sedition, but only to leasing-making or defamation of the
King, and may be prosecuted on the statutes in that behalf.</P>
<P>BUT we must needs think otherwise of that author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Leasing-making and Sedition.</NOTE> who,
having no such cause of quarrel with his Majesty, shall
compose a work of reasoning and argument, wherein, beside
indulging in the like reproach of the Royal Person, he shall
attempt to shew that all kingly government is an abuse, and
that our own monarchy is a system of fraud and injustice;
and as a remedy for these evils, shall propose a plan of asso∣ciation,
to new model the state after another and more popu∣lar
fashion. An address of this kind is not merely out of
pique or spleen, or for indulgence of humour against a per∣son,
but hath a more serious character, and a deeper seat. It
is <HI>a measure and proceeding,</HI> which tends <HI>directly</HI> to occasion a
breach between Prince and people, <HI>and is taken by the author
for no other purpose.</HI></P>
<P>IN these instances the distinction is easy to be perceived.
Yet it is not and cannot be denied, that in other instances
there is a near affinity of the two crimes: in so much that cases
may be imagined (and perhaps this is true of some which have
been already cited), of such a character, as shall be in one
both leasing-making and sedition, or of which it shall be hard
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
to say whether they more properly belong to the one or
other denomination, or which might with propriety be li∣belled
alternatively, as the one or the other, according
to the circumstances of the fact, as they shall appear in evi∣dence
upon the trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 21. 1712.</NOTE> In the case, accordingly, of James
Sands and others, which was in some measure of this de∣scription,
there was not only a charge of leasing-making
upon the slander as referrible to the Queen, but a charge of
undue and scandalous reflections cast upon the government
of the country.</P>
<P>PUT the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of Leasing making and Sedition.</NOTE> that a disgraced favorite assembles his
friends, and acquaints them that the King is a Papist, and
has a purpose against the Protestant religion; under which
pretence he exhorts them to resistance, and concerts with
them the means of strengthening their interest with the
people, so as they may make head against him. This seems
to be both leasing-making and sedition. It is the telling of
a lie against the King, and upon that lie grounding a mea∣sure
of hostility and disaffection, to disturb the State.</P>
<P>BUT although the two offences may thus in some instances
coincide, yet leasing-making and sedition are not convertible
terms. There is leasing-making which is not sedition; and
there is sedition which is not leasing-making, and could not
with any propriety be charged as such. This, in particular,
was the judgment of the Court upon the indictments of Muir,
Palmer, Gerald, and their associates, tried for seditious prac∣tices,
in 1793 and 1794. And certainly this distinction applied
to those cases in its fullest force. For in none of them was
there any charge of slander circulated, or of reproach or con∣tempt
thrown out, against his present Majesty, but of writings
distributed, combinations formed, meetings held, and reso∣lutions
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
lutions taken, such as were calculated to withdraw the affec∣tions
of the people from the established government of the
land, and dispose them to work its downfal at all hazards,
and without regard or distinction of means.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the punishment of leasing-making<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funishment of Leasing-making</NOTE> It is
limited by the act of Anne, to fine, imprisonment, or ba∣nishment;
under which last term, in the cases of Gerald
and Sinclair, in February and March 1794, the Lords of Ju∣sticiary
had occasion incidentally, but very deliberately,
to give their opinion, that banishment by transportation to
the foreign colonies is included.</P>
<P>AND here, (that I may not entirely pass over a matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transportation.</NOTE>
which, though of no uncommon interest or curiosty in itself,
has however of late been more agitated than almost any
point of the Scottish practice), I shall briesly observe, that
according to the phraseology of the law of Scotland, and
as expounded in the records and proceedings of Court, (cer∣tainly
the most unexceptionable evidence of the meaning
of any term of law) this of <HI>banishment</HI> is a broad and ge∣neral
term, applicable alike to either mode of exile, by
simple exclusion from the realm of Scotland, or by convey∣ance
to parts abroad, and by confinement there. The terms
<HI>transport</HI> and <HI>transportation,</HI> are not native nor proper terms
of the law of Scotland, but a new and foreign style, which
has only of late years been borrowed by us from the English
practice, owing to the British statutes which have assign∣ed
that punishment for sundry ossences, or have regula∣ted
the manner of carrying it into effect. As words of
common language, and in the subordinate and explanatory
parts of sentence, which describe the method of executing
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
the doom, those terms were indeed occasionally used; but the
genuine and legitimate style of a Scots doom of <HI>deportation,</HI> and
that which always before, and for long after the year 1703
was employed in the <HI>body</HI> of the sentence, that part of it
which <HI>decerns</HI> and <HI>ordains</HI> the thing to be done, was invariably
to <HI>banish,</HI> and not to <HI>transport.</HI> Thus on the petition of Ja∣net
Spens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 24. 1676.</NOTE> “The Lords decern and adjudge her to be <HI>ba∣nished</HI>
this kingdom, never to return again under the pain
of death; and ordain the Magistrates of Dysert to <HI>transport</HI>
her from the tolbooth of Edinburgh to the tolbooth of
Dysert, and there to keep her in firmance and captivi∣ty
until occasion offer for <HI>transporting her beyond seas.</HI>”</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation. Feb. 15. 1692.</NOTE> in the case of Richard Guine, “The
Lords, in respect of the said verdict, do <HI>banish</HI> the said
Richard Guine furth of this kingdom, never to return in
time coming, under the pain of undergoing such punish∣ment
as the said Lords shall appoint; and ordain him to
be carried back to prison, and to be detained therein <HI>till
he be transported.</HI>”</P>
<P>AGAIN; in the case of John Morton, after appointing
him to be scourged and to stand in the pillory, the sentence
proceeds thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 17. 1701.</NOTE> “And thereafter, the Lords do <HI>banish</HI> him
furth of this kingdom never to return to the same again,
under all highest pains; and ordains him to be carried
back to prison, and therein to remain <HI>until a convenient
occasion offer for his transportation.</HI>”</P>
<P>AS also, on the 11th November 1702, Elspeth Johnston
and Isobel Crawford have sentence in these words: “Like∣as
the said Lords <HI>banish</HI> the said Elspeth Johnston and Iso∣bel
Crawford furth of this kingdom, during all the days
of their lifetime, under all highest pains; and ordains them
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
to be carried from the Water-gate to the Correction-house,
and there to be detained <HI>till a fit opportunity offer for their
transportation, never to return.</HI>”</P>
<P>ON the 17th of the same month, Janet Syme is doom∣ed
in almost the same terms, thus: “Likeas, the said
Lords <HI>banish</HI> the said Janet Syme furth of this kingdom,
during all the days of her lifetime, never to return again,
under all the highest pains; and ordains her to be carried
back from the Water-gate to the Correction-house, and
there to be detained <HI>till a fit opportunity offer for her tran∣sportation.</HI>”</P>
<P>CASES, without number, might be quoted to this effect. I
have selected these, as among the nearest in date to the sta∣tute
1703.</P>
<P>IN other cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> also very numerous, where the decerning
clause is fuller, and makes mention of the quarter of the
world to which the prisoner is to be carried, still the decer∣niture
is to <HI>banish,</HI> or for <HI>banishment</HI> of the prisoner, and not
to transport him thither. I shall refer to the following, out
of many that might be produced. The case of John Val∣lance,
May 7. 1687; of Hugh Smith, on the same day; of
Maxwell and Rankin, November 7. 1690; of Helen Scott,
November 21. 1693; Bisset and Currier, August 8. 1705;
Christian Strachan, November 24. 1712; William Baillie,
September 15. 1715; John Pringle, June 21. 1715.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to pursue the train of cases onwards.
Suffice it to say, that this continued to be the form of sen∣tence
down at least to the years 1754 and 1755, in which I
find these instances of judgment, <HI>banishing</HI> to the plantations:
The case of Ronald Macdonald, August 13. 1754; Alexan∣der
Sime, December 10. 1754; David Murray, January 25.
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
1755; Alexander Cameron, April 25. 1755; and Janet Robert∣son,
August 13. of the same year. Nay, so-firmly had this style
been settled, that the Court would not depart from it even in
applying those British statutes, which inflict the punish∣ment
of transportation. On the 27th February 1721, Chris∣tie,
Wilson, and Keddy, are indicted for the forcible hin∣drance
of a revenue-officer, on a statute of the 6th of Geo. I.
which ordains the offender “to be <HI>transported</HI> to some of
his Majesty's colonies in America;” for a space not ex∣ceeding
seven years. The libel concludes, that the pannels
“ought to be punished with the pains provided for such of∣fence
by the act above recited.” The Court “find the
libel relevant to infer the pains of the act libelled.” On
the 8th March 1721, Keddy is found guilty by the assize.
In reference to which conviction, the Court, “By the
mouth of Charles Kinross, macer of Court, <HI>banish</HI> the
said Jeremiah Keddy to some of his Majesty's plantations
in America for the space of five years; and ordain him to
be detained in the tolbooth of Edinburgh, aye and while
an occasion offer for <HI>transporting</HI> him thither<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of William Deane, convicted of coining half-pence, (November 1729), the sentence is “to banish or transport him to the plantations.” The style of sentence in the Court of Session, in the cases of their criminal cognizance, was precisely the same. See Acts of Sederunt, (Edit. 1790), case of Adie and Shaw, July 28. 1739; William Stevenson, February 18 1747; John Smith, March 2. 1753; Charles Turner, February 25. 1757; James Baillie, July 18. 1765; Peter Dow, August 11. 1773.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> in the other proceedings and interlocutors
of Court, having reference to, or making mention of this sort
of sentence, no appellation but <HI>banishment</HI> seems, in any in∣stance,
to have been applied to it. In the case, among others,
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
of William Baillie, the interlocutor of relevancy has this
clause: “And also find the said William Baillie, his being
“convict at the time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 15. 1715.</NOTE> and of the crimes libelled, before the
Lords of Justiciary, and thereupon sentenced to death; and
thereafter the said sentence being by the Lords of his Ma∣jesty's
Privy Council commuted to <HI>banishment,</HI> upon an
enactment to depart furth of his Majesty's dominions to
<HI>America, separatim,</HI> relevant,” &amp;c. Again; in the record
of the 12th March 1701; we find a recommendation from
the Lords of Privy Council, relative to the execution of
sentence of death upon Thomas Anderson and John Weir,
“which sentence of death (it says) was formerly com∣muted
and changed <HI>into sentence of banishment furth of
his Majesty's dominions</HI> by the said Lords, not to return into
this kingdom under the pain and certification of having
the said sentence of death put to execution against them.”
It proceeds to relate, that the said persons had nevertheless
been found in Scotland, and therefore “the Council have re∣voked
and hereby revokes and discharges the foresaid com∣mutation
and change of sentence from death to <HI>banish∣ment,</HI>
and have remitted,” &amp;c. There follows an order for
putting the sentence of death in execution. On the 13th and
17th of the same mouth, other proceedings take place rela∣tive
to the same persons, which explain the nature of the <HI>ba∣nishment</HI>
here alluded to. A report had, it seems, been made
to the Privy Council by the Lord Advocate; which report
relates, “That the Lords of Privy Council did alter the
sentence of death pronounced against him (Anderson) to
<HI>banishment,</HI> not to return under the pain of death, and
that accordingly he was liberate <HI>and sent to Flanders;</HI> but
having returned, and being again apprehended, the said
Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council upon the 9th Fe∣bruary
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
1699, <HI>did banish him and some others to his Majesty's
plantations in America.</HI>” Thus the one entry in the re∣cord
explains, that the sentence, which in the other is simply
styled a sentence of <HI>banishment,</HI> was truly sentence of trans∣portation,
first to Flanders, (whither he was probably car∣ried
to serve as a soldier), and afterwards to the foreign
plantations.</P>
<P>As banishment was thus the term,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> which the courts of
law, in 1703, were in the use of employing when they ad∣judged
any one to be transported; is it to be imagined, that,
in framing the statute of that year, which was made for the
precise purpose of limiting the punishment of leasing-ma∣king,
the Legislature would have made use of this very term,
if their meaning had been to forbid the inflicting of
transportation for any such offence? There seems to be
no ordinary nor probable rule of construction, under which
this could be held to have been their meaning, if there
were even nothing in the statute but the bare term of ba∣nishment,
unaccompanied with any other words or provi∣sions
to expound it. And far less is such a construc∣tion
to be applied in the actual circumstances of this statute,
whereof the preamble informs us that it was made, because
the laws therein recited and altered were “<HI>as to the foresaid
capital punishment,</HI> of dangerous consequence,” and which
reserves an express power to punish the offender in his per∣son,
“<HI>life and limb always preserved.</HI>” So that according to
the very words of the act, its utmost scope and purpose is
to protect the leasing-maker against the severity of those an∣cient
edicts which punished him with death.</P>
<P>TO these considerations, chiefly two arguments have
been opposed. It is said, that in the statute 1670, c. 2.
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
which authorises transportation in the case there provided
for, that punishment is described at large, “as banishment
by sending them to his Majesty's plantations in the Indies.”
But this one instance of the employment of a fuller phrase,
and this too in a rigorous law, which is penned throughout
with a plain anxiety to fix matters down against the delin∣quent,
will never outweigh the evidence which arises from
the ordinary use of the simple term <HI>banishment,</HI> in that same
broad sense, in the sentences and proceedings of Court.
Still less will it prove, that such a specification was necessary
in a statute, which was not made, like the act 1670, to
create a new offence, and assign its punishment, but only to
limit the severity of former laws against an old and known
transgression, by protecting the delinquent in life and limb.
Accordingly, this construction has been put upon the term
<HI>banishment</HI> in the statute concerning fraudulent bankrupts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1696, c. 3.</NOTE>
which, (with as near an affinity of phrase to the act 1703 as
can be expected to happen in any two laws), appoints them
“to be punished by banishment or otherwise, death except∣ed,
as they shall see cause.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1748.</NOTE> Under this statute, the Lords
of Session gave sentence, adjudging George and Robert For∣resters
to be banished to the plantations<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Acts of Sederunt.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE other argument is founded on the act 1609,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> c. 9.
one of the statutes concerning leasing-makers, which orders
them “to be punished by imprisonment, <HI>banishment,</HI> fining
or mair rigorous corporal pain.” These two ordinan∣ces,
(it is said), in 1609 and 1703, being <HI>in pari materia,</HI>
are to be construed in the same way; and <HI>banishment</HI> in
the act 1609 could not possibly mean <HI>transportation,</HI> as Scot∣land
had not at that time, nor until the end of that cen∣tury,
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
any colonial possession of its own, in which to re∣ceive
or confine the convicts. And it is argued, that
without the command of some such settlement there could
be no sentence of transportation, by reason of the want of
power in any court, to carry its decree into effect in any
place which is out of the bounds of its own jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THIS, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> (to pass over all other answers<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In particular,—If transportation <HI>had</HI> been unknown in 1609, but had come into practice in the course of that century, and been invariably known under the style of <HI>banishment,</HI> (which we have seen was the case); must not the Legislature be held to have used that term, in the statute 1703, in its established sense <HI>as at that time,</HI> without any regard to the application it had in 1609?</NOTE>), is a
hasty inference, which has been made without a due re∣search
into facts, and in the rash confidence, that because
the thing could not formerly be done in the precise form
and fashion which is known in our days, therefore it could
not be done at all. I learn, on the contrary, from the re∣cords
of Court, that transportation to parts abroad was a
sentence known to the Scottish practice at that very time.</P>
<P>ON the 14th September 1609, Andrew Henderson is con∣victed
of the crime of mutilation; but, on account of some
difficulty in the case, the Justice delays to pronounce doom,
till his Majesty's pleasure on the matter be known. Ac∣cordingly,
on the 18th April 1610, a letter from the Lords of
Privy Council is presented to the Court, wherein, “Accoir∣ding
to the Kingis Maujestie's will, plesour, and directione,”
they ordain the Justice and his deputes “to pronunce dome
and sentence againis him, ordaining him to be <HI>banist</HI> his
Majestie's <HI>bail dominionis,</HI> during his lifetime, and nocht
to returne againe wythin the samyn, <HI>under the paine of deid;</HI>

the said Andro returne bak againe to his waird wythin

wairdours in the tolbuth, <HI>quhill he be reddie to inbark, and

Whereanent the extract of y<SUP>ir</SUP> presentis sall be unto ye said
Justice-Clerk, and y<SUP>air</SUP> deputtis, ane sufficient warrand.”
Agreeably to this order, “The Justice, be the mouth of
John Lawsoun, dempster of Court, decernit and ordainit
y<SUP>e</SUP> said Andro Henderson <HI>to be baneist our Sovernine Lordis
haill dominionis,</HI> during his lyfetyme, and nocht to returne
againe wythyn the samyn, <HI>under ye paine of deid;</HI> as he

with y<SUP>e</SUP> remanent wairdours, <HI>qubille he be reddie to imbarque,
and that ordour be tane for convoy, and transpoirt of him to his
schip.</HI>”</P>
<P>AS this record puts it out of question, that transporta∣tion
was a known mode of punishment at that period; so
the following is no less unexceptionable evidence of the
application of it, in those days, to the crime of leasing∣making.
In March 1612,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. &amp; 13. 1612.</NOTE> William Tweedie in Heuch
Brae, was convicted of uttering certain scandalous and
irreverent speeches against the King, his Council and Jus∣tices;
and doom passed on him in these terms: “The
Justice, with the advice of the Lords of his Hieness
Secret Counsall, by the mouth of Alexander Kennedy,
dempster of Court, decernit and ordainit the said William
Tweedie in Heugh Brae, to be scourgit through the burgh
of Edinburgh, and thereafter <HI>to be banishet furth of his Ma∣jestie's
haill dominions,</HI> and naewise to return again with∣in
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
the samin, <HI>undir the pain of hanging to the dead, but farder
doom;</HI> and being scourgit thro' the town, that the Mag<SUP>s</SUP>.
of Edin. return him back again to his waird within their
thieve's hole, <HI>therein to remain whyle ane ship be provydet
to transport him furth of his Majestie's dominions in manner fore∣said,</HI>
whilk was pronounced for doom.”</P>
<P>THE following are farther instances of the same sort of sen∣tence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE>
On the 13th September 1615, James Moffat <HI>alias</HI> Ha∣lyburton,
a Jesuit, in pursuance of a warrant from the Privy
Council, has sentence, and enacts himself, and is ordered
to find caution<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In transcribing some of the following entries from the record, the old spel∣ling has not been preserved. But if not presented <HI>totidem litteris,</HI> they are at least faithfully given <HI>totidem verbis.</HI></NOTE> “to depart and pass away furth of his
Majesty's dominions, betwixt and the 20th October next
to come, <HI>wind and weather serving,</HI> and naewise to return
again within the famin, under the pains of dead.” The
act of Court proceeds to relate, that the Justice ordered him,
“to be taken back again to the tolbooth and ward-house
of Edinburgh, by John Macmath, Baillie of Edin<SUP>r</SUP>;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>” and
it concludes with directing, “that he remain in the said
ward <HI>while a ship be in readiness wherein he may be transported,</HI>
according to the said Lords of Secret Councils warrand
direct to my Lord Justice for that effect, dated 23d Au∣gust
1615.”</P>
<P>LIKEWISE; upon the 18th March 1618, in the case of Colin
Bruce, and under authority of the like warrant, the Court
“ordainit the said Colin Bruce <HI>to be banished as of before his
Highness haill dominions,</HI> and never to be found within the
samin, <HI>under the pain of dead,</HI> but farther favour.” And
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
the act of Court after relating that Bruce enacted himself
to that effect, concludes thus: “Likeas the said Justice or∣dained
the said Colin conform to the said Lords warrant
to be returned back again to the said Ward by the ma∣gistrates
of Edinburgh, to be kept by them therein in sure
ward, firmance and captivity, <HI>unto the time a ship be prepa∣red
wherein he may be transported.”</HI></P>
<P>LEASING-MAKING is again punished with transportation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE>
in the case of George Nicol, in 1633, for calumniating the
King's officers, and depraving his measures. On the 8th
March the Justice deserts the diet against him, “in respect
the Lords of Secret Council, by warrand and direction
from his Majesty, has tried the crimes foresaid before them∣selves,
and has found him culpable thereof, and has given
out <HI>sentence of banishment against him furth of his Majesty's haill
dominions,</HI> together with their ordinance that he should,”
&amp;c. Here the act relates the order of Council for placing
him on the pillory; and it concludes thus: “And returned
thereafter back again to the tolbooth to ward, to remain
therein, <HI>while ane ship be prepared to transport him furth
of his Majesty's dominions;</HI> whilk sentence has accordingly
been execut upon him the said 6th of March in example
of others.”</P>
<P>ON the 2d of February 1636, William and Thomas Mac∣kie,
convicted of falsehood, are in like manner <HI>banished</HI>
upon a warrant of Privy Council. After directing them
to be placed in the pillory, the sentence proceeds in these
words: “And that they be returned back by the said
hangman frae the said market-cross, after the said 12th
hour of the said day, to their said ward, there to re∣main,
<HI>while they be shipped in ane ship for their trans∣porting
out of this kingdom,</HI> and that they should do their
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
exact diligence in making of their preparation, and pro∣vision
to depart, and that within the space of 40 days,
limited by said Lords of Secret Council for their removing,
and away passing.” The decerning clause of the sentence
is thus: “And to be <HI>banished</HI> this kingdom, viz. the said
William Mackie of Mortoun, during the King's pleasure,
and the said Thomas Mackie during his lifetime, and ne∣ver
to return again <HI>under the pain of death.</HI>”</P>
<P>ON the 4th April 1637,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> Janet Davidson, convicted of adul∣tery,
is by warrant of “Council <HI>banished</HI> furth of this
kingdom,” under the pain of death, and is ordered to
be sent back to ward, “to remain thair <HI>while ane ship be
in readyness for her transporting;</HI> and at the time of her
conveying to the said ship, that she be carried by the or∣dinary
executioner or hangman of said burgh of Edin∣burgh,
to the house of correction, and to be stamped and
burnit by him with ane hot iron, in any one of her hands,
either fore or back part thereof, <HI>and therefra transportit to
the said ship.</HI>”</P>
<P>IT would not invalidate the evidence of these records, al∣though,
at this distance of time, the precise fashion could not
be shewn, in which sentences of this kind were carried into
effect abroad. The proof would still be unimpeachable, that
in one shape or other the convict was transported. But we
have not even this difficulty to contend with. For, from the
same authentic source of information, we have the know∣ledge
of at least one mode of explicating the sentence in the
way of confinement and servitude abroad, not less effectual,
and even more rigorous, than that which is now in practice.
It was simply thus. In those days, the younger sons of the
Scots gentry were soldiers of fortune, in almost every ser∣vice
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
in Europe; and it appears that they were permitted to
recruit at home. The Justice, therefore, to insure the exe∣cution
of his sentence of banishment, had recourse to the
easy, but substantial expedient of adjudging the convicts as
soldiers to those officers, to serve them in the foreign wars, and
of taking surety from the officers, (as in later times from the
contractor for transporting felons), To keep the men abroad,
and employ them in military service. For farther security,
the Justice added the certification of death, if the banished
man should at any time of his life return to, or be found with∣in
the realm of Scotland. It will be proper to state the evi∣dence
of this practice at large, and in the very words of
the record.</P>
<P>ON the 24th August 1626,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> Robert Arbroath and four per∣sons
more, prisoners for sundry crimes, compeared before the
Justices, “and acted themselves of their own consents, and
became bound and obliged <HI>to depart off this country with
Crowner Mackie, to serve in his Majesty's weirs beyond sea,</HI> and
never to be found again within any part of his Majesty's do∣minions
in time coming, <HI>under the paine of dead.</HI> Thereafter
the saids five persons were by direction of my Lord Ju∣stice-Clerk,
taken back to ward by the Baillie to stay there∣intill,
while they were delivered to the <HI>Captain or Crown∣er,
to be put aboard of the ship with the remainent soldiers con∣ducit
for his Majesty's service</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The officer, in this instance, was in the King's service. But still the man was to be detained, and to serve, abroad only, and beyond seas.</NOTE>” These proceedings were
under authority of a warrant of Privy Council.</P>
<P>ON the 15th June 1631,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> in virtue of the like warrant, pro∣ceeding
on the supplication of Captain Alexander Fairly,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
John Cumin appears before the Justice, and enacts himself
“<HI>to be transported by him (Fairly) to Germany, there to serve under
him as ane soldier in the wars thereof,</HI> he first becoming acted
in the books of adjournal to depart furth of this kingdom,
and not to return again within the samin without licence,
<HI>under the pain of dead.</HI>” The act concludes with an order
for delivery of his person to Alexander Cumin, who becomes
caution to receive him from the Magistrates of Edinburgh,
and to deliver him to Captain Fairly, to the effect foresaid.</P>
<P>ON the 22d March 1633, Daniel Nisbet is convicted of
theft before the Justice. The prosecutor, William Kirkwood,
sets forth, that the prisoner “<HI>is ane lusty young man who might
be made serviceable in the wars,</HI>” and he is accordingly ba∣nished,
by warrant of Privy Council, whereof the entry
concludes thus: “And ordainis him to be detained in ward
untill occasion shall be had of <HI>some Captain who will
undertake and be answerable to transport the said Daniel furth
of the kingdom,</HI> unto whom the said Lords ordainis and
commands the Provost and Bailies of Edinburgh to de∣liver
the said Daniel to that effect.” The sentence of
Court ordains “the said Daniel Nisbet to <HI>be banished this king∣dom,</HI>
and not to return again within the samin in time co∣ming
<HI>under the pain of dead.</HI>”</P>
<P>THERE is the following entry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transportation.</NOTE> of the 31st July 1633, with
respect to John Lawson, a prisoner apprehended by the Laird
of Innerleath, and charged with the stealing of two horses;
who, “conform to an act of the Lords of Secret Council,
of his awin consent became acted and obliged <HI>as ane banished
man,</HI> to depart off this kingdom, and not to be found therein
in ony time coming, without his Majesty's licence, under
the paine of dead. Likeas for that effect he was presently
tain off the said Laird of Innerleath his hands, by Mr
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
George Gladstanes, <HI>scrivener to Captain Robert Maxwell, to
be transported and put in ane ship with the said Captain Ro∣bert
his other soldiers, furth of this kingdom to the realm of
France.</HI>”</P>
<P>ON the 7th August 1635, James Gordon, Alexander Cowie,
John Cassie, Robert Watson, John Macinnes, George Watt;
John Grant, and William Kirkwood, persons accused of theft,
are decerned by the Justice-depute “to be of their awin
consent <HI>banished this realm,</HI> and never to be fund within the
samin at any time hereafter without his Majesty's licence,
<HI>under the pain of dead.</HI> Likeas the saids James Gordon, &amp;c.
acted themselves of their awin consent to depart and pass

and to serve him in the weirs,</HI> and nocht to return within
this kingdom, without his Majesty's licence hereafter, un∣der
the paine foresaid (of dead); <HI>and the said Captain Thomas
Moffat being personally present, accepted them as his soldiers,
and obliged him to transport them furth of this kingdom</HI> with
himself, so that they should not be seen on the public
streets or highways, while they are shipping and putting
aboard, under pain of 500 merks money.”</P>
<P>ON the 8th August 1636,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transportation.</NOTE> Patrick Davidson, charged with
prevarication and contradictory depositions, enacts himself
before the Justice-depute, “<HI>to be banished this kingdom,</HI> and to
<HI>pass aff the samin to the weirs,</HI> and not to be found within
the samin thereafter, without his Majesty's licence, under
<HI>the pain of dead.</HI>” The charge in this case was not of a
capital nature. And the enactment proceeded under autho∣rity
and “at command of the said Justice-depute.”</P>
<P>THE same thing was done, and under the same authority,
in the case of John More,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15. 1636.</NOTE> a person convicted of breaking into
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
a press and stealing writs. He appeared in Court, and “be∣came
acted and obliged of his awin consent to undergo
the sentence of <HI>voluntary banishment,</HI> and to depart and pass
away <HI>as ane banished man</HI> furth of his Majesty's haill do∣minions,
and specially aff this his Majesty's kingdom of
Scotland,” under the pain of death. The entry proceeds
thus: “To the whilk sentence of voluntary <HI>banishment</HI> the
said Justice-depute has interponit and interponis his au∣thority
by thir presents. Likeas James Balfour <HI>serjeant to
Colonel Sir David Balfour, brother to my Lord of Burly, being
also personally present in judgment,</HI> CHAPPIT HANDS <HI>with the
said John More, acceptit and receivit him as ane soldier to the
said Sir David, and became actit and obligit to put him in ane
ship, to be carried and transportit by him with the remanent
soldiers furth of this kingdom towards the Low Countries, there
to serve in the wars,</HI> and that within 14 days next to come;
the said John More remaining always in waird, till the
said ship be in readyness for his putting aboard and <HI>trans∣portation,</HI>
as said is.”</P>
<P>IN the month of February 1639,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> there are three proceed∣ings
and sentences of the same sort. On the 6th of that
month, Alexander Craig, convicted of stealing six sheep, is,
by authority of the Justice-depute, “decerned and adjudg∣ed
to be <HI>banished</HI> furth of this realm and kingdom of Scot∣land,
and <HI>to be delivered for that effect to Captain Walter Mur∣ray
to serve in the weirs in foreign parts,</HI> and naewise to re∣turn
back again within this kingdom, or to be fund with∣in
the samin at any time after <HI>his transportation,</HI> and away
passing, without his Majesty's special licence or warrant,
<HI>under the paine of death,</HI> to be execute upon him with all ri∣gour.”
On the same day, Richard Lauder, who had pre∣viously
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
been banished, as convicted of various thefts, is, on
production of these sentences, again banished: “The Jus∣tices,
in consideration of the notoriety of the said Richard
Lauder, his vicious life, and yet mitigating justice with
mercy, upon hope of the said Richard his amendment, or∣dained
<HI>him to be bannished this realm,</HI> and noways to be
found within the samin at any time hereafter, <HI>under the
pain of banging to the death,</HI> but favor. Which sen∣tence
the said Richard maist willingly accepted, and of
his awn consent, became acted and obligit to depart and
<HI>pass aff this kingdom in company of Captain Walter Murray, to
serve him in the wars in foreign parts,</HI> and naways to return
back again within this kingdom, or to be found thairintill
at ony time hereafter, <HI>under the said pain of hanging to the
death.</HI> In respect whereof the Justice ordained the said
Richard Lauder, with the said Alexander Craig, to be
returned back to their waird within the said tolbooth of
Edinburgh, therein to remain <HI>while their delivery to the said
Captain Walter Murray, to be transported by him as said is.</HI>”
On the 25th of the same month, under authority of the Jus∣tice-General,
John Tailzeour, a prisoner, on suspicion of
stealing a silver <HI>tass</HI> (or cup), and other capital crimes, “be∣comes
actit and obligit of his awin consent to be <HI>banished
this kingdom of Scotland, and to depart and pass aff the sa∣min,

special grantit to him for that effect, <HI>under the paine of
death,</HI> to be execute upon him with all rigour but farder
doome or process of law to follow thereupon.”</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119"/>
ON 1st March 1639, William Bar, late servant to Sir James
Hamilton of Redhall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> charged with stealing five silver spoons
in the time of his service, is brought out of ward, confesses
the crime, and submits himself to the Justice's pleasure.—
“In respect whereof, his Majesty's Justice-General, mitiga∣ting
justice with mercy, ordainit the said William Bar to
be <HI>bannished this his Majesty's kingdom of Scotland,</HI> and not to

<P>ON the 28th October 1639,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> John Maccarrall, accused of
adultery, and also as a counterfeit fool, and one who feigns
himself to be dumb, confesses these charges, and enacts him∣self
“to depart and pass aff this kingdom as <HI>a bannished man,</HI>
and to pass away furth thereof, in company of Colonel
Alexander Erskine, <HI>to serve him as ane soldier in the wars in
foreign parts.</HI>”</P>
<P>ON the 19th July 1642, Henry Malcolm, charged with steal∣ing
certain sums of money, enacts himself to depart as a sol∣dier
under Captain; and John Johnston, charged
with uttering false coin, enacts himself to depart with Ma∣jor
Riddell; both under the <HI>pain of death.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 6th January 1643, John Ahaunay and Robert
Slowan, both charged with theft, (the one of 16 nolt, the
other of a mare), are banished by the Justice-depute, with∣out
any trial, conform to warrant of Secret Council. They
accept the sentence, and become bound to pass away with
Captain John Macmath, to serve him as soldiers in the fo∣reign
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
wars, and not to be found in Scotland after their ship∣ping,
under the pain of death.</P>
<P>UPON the whole of these passages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> two observations seem to
arise. 1 <HI>st,</HI> Every case that has been quoted, is an additional
evidence of the settled construction of the terms <HI>banishment</HI> and
<HI>banished man;</HI> which we find to have been thus invariably
applied to the person who was adjudged to be sent <HI>abroad,</HI>
there to continue and serve, whether under his Majesty or
some foreign Prince, as an indented soldier <HI>in the foreign
wars. 2 dly,</HI> These records are evidence, that from an early
period of the 17th century, the punishment of transportation
was known to the practice of Scotland, and this in a form
at least as substantial and severe as at the present day. It
was practised too, in the several forms of sentence on con∣viction,
and of voluntary enactment, as in later times;
and the doom was attended with the same certification of
death in case of return to Scotland, as under the latest
statutes of his present Majesty. Thus an end is put to the ar∣gument,
(an argument in itself utterly inconclusive<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See the note, p. 108.</NOTE>), which
has been reared upon the statute 1609; and it is shown with∣al,
that the defect of power in any court, to carry its sentence
into execution beyond the bounds of its own territory,
was no hinderance of the substantial accomplishment of the
same object in those ancient times, which is now attained in
another way. The truth is, that in all cases of transportation
to parts beyond seas, the restraint and confinement which
take place abroad are not, in any proper sense, by the authori∣ty
of the court which gives the sentence; and this is equally
true of the modern as of the ancient form of carrying the
judgment into effect. All that the sentence of the Justice
did of old, was lawfully to enlist the convict; to put him as
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
a soldier, into the hands of an officer, within this realm of
Scotland, with an order to convey him from thence, accom∣panied
with a declaration of the consequence, if ever he
should again be found within the jurisdiction of the Court.
The restraint which the man was subject to on his ar∣rival
in the foreign country, was not in virtue of any
dominion of the Justiciar of Scotland there, (for he could
pretend to none), but in virtue of the sovereignty of the
foreign Prince or State, in whose service such officer was
employed. By the commission derived from that impe∣rial
authority, the officer was empowered to keep, and to re∣strain
by military discipline, all his soldiers and recruits,
of whatsoever country, regularly engaged to him according
to the law of the land where he procured them. The juris∣diction
of the Justice was no otherwise concerned, and his
sentence had no farther operation, than by engaging the
man as a soldier here, at home, and thus rendering him a
lawful object of those coercive powers abroad, which the
officer derived from quite a separate and foreign source.
And just so at this day, one who is condemned to
transportation by the Lords of Justiciary, is not confined
in New South Wales upon the mandate and warrant of
that Court, but by the order of his Majesty and Privy
Council; who, in virtue of the several statutes enacted in
that behalf, have power to name his place of destination,
and to detain and employ in labour there, (through the
medium of the contractors with the persons by them au∣thorised),
such convicts as have sentence for transport∣able
crimes. The power which confines and employs
the felon abroad, is therefore the controlling power of the
British Legislature over the colonial possessions belonging to
the kingdom. The authority of the Court, whether Scots
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
or English, which adjudges him to be transported, is no
farther exerted than by rendering him a lawful object of
those powers, with which, by statute, his Majesty (with the
advice of his Privy Council) has been invested. His case, in
short, is like that of a vagabond who is <HI>comprehended</HI> (as it
is called), and made a soldier under one of those occasional
statutes which are passed for the more speedy recruiting of
his Majesty's forces. By the sentence of the Justices of
Peace, proceeding upon such a statute, the vagabond is made
a soldier, in like manner, and as effectually, as if he were
voluntarily to inlist. And here the exertion of their autho∣rity
ends. The peculiarities of the man's condition after∣wards,
are the operation of the mutiny act, which attaches
upon all persons who in this or any other way have lawfully
been engaged as soldiers.</P>
<P>THAT this sort of punishment was introduced under autho∣rity
of the Privy Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> and was chiefly applied at first to
cases in themselves of a capital nature, nowise invalidates the
inference which is made from these memorials of our ancient
practice. In truth, this was the course in that age, with almost
every thing of either a new or an extraordinary nature, in
the economy of the realm of Scotland. In particular, beside
a peculiar jurisdiction of their own, the Privy Council then
enjoyed an undisputed and constant superintendence of what∣soever
related to the administration of criminal justice; and
were in the use of frequent intercourse and consultation
with the Justice and his deputes, concerning any thing of
difficulty or importance that occurred in the business of the
Court. Nay, it was even declared by statute 1584, c. 129.
that the King and Council were Judges competent to all
persons, and in all cases whatsoever. How improper soever
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
any such control or interference in more regular and or∣derly
times, this was the rule and custom, the fixed and ac∣knowledged
law, of that period. And, because in the arbi∣trary
reigns of Charles II. and James VII. many unjust and
cruel things were done by the Counsellors of those Princes in
Scotland, (for which their memory is still attended with
the deserved reproach); it will not follow that the Privy
Councils of all former times are to be involved in the
same censure; still less that every proceeding which at
any period originated with the Privy Council, as the Su∣preme
Criminal Judicature of the land, is therefore to
be expunged from the law, though afterwards adopted
into the practice of the ordinary courts of justice, and
sanctified by their usage, and by the uniform acquies∣cence
of the country, in all later ages. Indeed, it appears
from the precedents quoted, of which seven are without any
warrant from the Privy Council, that as early as the time
of Charles I. the Justice and his deputes had begun to fol∣low
the example of that body, (who had always spoken
through the Justice-court as an organ); and thus by degrees,
the punishment of transportation became part of the com∣mon
and undoubted law of the land.</P>
<P>IT has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> however, been objected, that still it has become
so under certain modifications, and with respect only to
crimes of a certain class, namely, such as by the law of
Scotland are in themselves punishable with death It has
been affirmed that our records do not afford a single instance
of transportation, (unless it were voluntary), for any crime
of a lower degree.</P>
<P>IF the fact were even so; yet still, if it be true, that, ac∣cording
to a just construction of the term <HI>banishment,</HI> it is equi∣valent
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
to <HI>transportation,</HI> no inference could thence be made
towards the decision of this debate. We should still have
the express authority of the act 1703, to use transportation
as a punishment for this particular offence. But in truth,
it is rather to be wondered at, that an assertion should ever
have been hazarded, which would go to expunge at one
stroke a very large portion of the books of adjournal; so nu∣merous
are the instances of transportation applied to offences
which are not punishable with death, and which are not
by any statute made liable to banishment or transportation.
The crime of mobbing was punished in that way in the
case of Fairney and Turnbull, August 9. 1720; of James
Falconer and Janet Hill, October 6. 1725; of Buchanan, Ha∣milton,
Macfarlane, and Mitchell, October 15. 1725; of
Gilchrist, March 9. 1741; of Richard Robertson, in March
1773; of Fraser, July 26. 1784; of Paul and Anderson,
August 24. 1784; of Macgrigor, August 2. 1784.</P>
<P>THE same punishment was applied to the crime of wound∣ing
with intent to kill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> in the case of Alexander Sime, De∣cember
16. 1754; of John Ogilvy, March 8. 1756; and
Thomas Young, July 11. 1771. As also, to the crime of solicit∣ing
others to raise fire, in the case of William and Alexander
Fraser, November 4. and 14. 1720; to the case of defective
proof of murder, Bisset and Currier, June 1705; to the crime
of sending letters to extort money, in the case of John Fra∣ser,
March 19. 20. 1759, and of James Gray in June, July
1737; to the crime of swindling, in the case of James
Grahame, July 31. 1786, and of Thomas Hall, July 20.
1789; to the crime of falsehood and conspiracy against a
person's fame, in the case of Campbell of Burnbank in March
1721; to the crime of vitiating writings, (by sentence of the
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
Court of Session); in the case of William Dunbar, February
26. 1762; to the coining of halfpence, in the case of William
Deane, October 6. and November 4. 1729, (which offence the
Court had previously found relevant only to infer an arbitrary
punishment); to the crime of forcible abduction and marriage,
in the case of Thomas Gray in July 1751. These instances
may sussice as a specimen of the tenor of our practice in this
particular. In point of wickedness, and of danger, some of
the offences thus punished with transportation, are inferior
to that of leasing-making; and so far is the practice of Scot∣land
from refusing to listen to any argument of analogy or
comparison in such matters, (which some have supposed to be
the case), that, even where a crime is entirely new, and has
never before been the subject of trial, still our Judges have
the undoubted power, and are in the use, of applying such
a remedy to it, not excepting transportation, as the nature
and degree of the evil seem to require.</P>
<P>IN the close of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If punishable with Transpor∣tation.</NOTE> it has been urged, that at least in prac∣tice,
the act 1703 has not been construed to warrant transpor∣tation;
seeing that on no occasion since the date of the act has
leasing-making been punished in that way. But this, if it
were true, would only prove that no case has occurred in later
times; where the offender has been thought deserving of so
rigorous a judgment; as indeed neither has any case hap∣pened,
where sentence has been given for even simple ba∣nishment
from Scotland. But though this be true with re∣spect
to simple banishment, the fact is otherwise as to trans∣portation.
For in the case, already mentioned, of David
Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4. 1704.</NOTE> a case tried within a few months after the passing of
the act 1703, and in which the libel concluded for the pains of
this very statute, these were held by the Judges of that time,
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
(certainly better qualified than we to interpret the language
of their own days), to extend to transportation; and he ac∣cordingly
had sentence of <HI>banishment to the plantations.</HI> It is
true, that on petition to Parliament, the execution of this
sentence was suspended; but it does not appear that any mis∣construction
of the law, in this particular, was among the
reasons alleged for revisal of the proceedings.</P>
<P>I HAVE now spoken of this matter somewhat more fully
than I once intended, or than the value or curiosity of the
question, in itself, may seem to deserve. But for this I have
had other, more interesting, and I trust, not unworthy mo∣tives,
beside the desire of elucidating a point of law. Cer∣tainly
I shall not think the digression misplaced, nor my
pains thrown away, if, in any degree, I shall contribute to
prevent those false and injurious impressions with respect to
the administration of criminal justice in Scotland, which the
industrious, and too curious agitation of this controversy,
has been calculated to occasion.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF PERJURY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now spoken of the principal offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI.</NOTE> which are
to the injury of individuals in person, fame, or property.
And, according to the method which was marked out in the
introduction of this work, I shall now be led to inquire con∣cerning
such transgressions as are chiefly vindicated on ac∣count
of their pernicious tendency with respect to the pub∣lic
polity, and general welfare of the realm. These may be
distributed into several classes,—as they are injurious to the
administration of Justice; to the conservation of peace;
to public order, police, and economy; to the interests of
trade; to the rights of the King and his government; or to
the reverence of God and of religion.</P>
<P>I. AMONG those offences which are hostile to the course of
justice, that which may seem to challenge the first rank,
(though perhaps among the lower orders of people reputed
more venial than many others, but for that very reason so
much the more necessary to be diligently inquired after),
is the crime of Perjury, or the judicial affirmation of false∣hood
upon oath. For, beside the magnitude of this trans∣gression
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
in a religious point of view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PERJURY.</NOTE> (which is such that in
all ages and countries the religon of an oath has been held
to bind even to a stranger or an enemy), it destroys the se∣curity
of all manner of rights and possessions, and thus tends
to defeat the great ends of law and government, and even
to unloose the bonds of society among men.</P>
<P>1. THE substance of the crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain False∣hood must be said.</NOTE> and that which all the
other particulars in the description of it only modify and
limit is, that a plain falsehood be explicitly and wilfully
affirmed. For, if either there is any doubt about the true
state of the fact, or about the sense in which the pannel's
words are to be understood; or if they can in any reason∣able
way be reconciled with the truth, or with an innocent
intention; or, in general, if it is not manifest and obvious,
but matter of likelihood only, and of inference and com∣parison
of many particulars, that he had a false and corrupt
meaning, this shall save him from the accusation of perjury.
Indeed, it would be very dangerous to convict any one up∣on
such constructive grounds; considering the imperfection of
language, and the still more imperfect use which so many
persons have of it, and how unequal their degrees of intelli∣gence
in the affairs of life, and even their degrees of capa∣city
for the observation of facts.</P>
<P>THIS scrupulous and equitable caution was in particular
observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain False∣hood must be said.</NOTE> in deciding on the relevancy of the libel against
Archibald Mackillop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. and Nov. 18. &amp; 25. 1754.</NOTE> This man had been a witness in the
trial of certain persons for a violent deforcement of the re∣venue-officers,
and had given a testimony, which in many
points was very favourable to the pannels. Among other
things, he had sworn, that they addressed the revenue-officers
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
in a moderate and inoffensive manner, “desiring them to
walk soberly, and to make no disturbance.” Now, in this
article, beside others, he was charged with perjury; in as
much (said the libel) as it will be proved, that the persons
accused went violently up to the officers, demanded their
arms, and threatened to blow them up, if they resisted. It
was pleaded for the pannel, that the two assertions were not
absolutely inconsistent; for that in swearing to the one sort
of address and course of behaviour, he did not absolutely
exclude the other, which might be used at a different period
of the fray, and without his attending to it at the time.
The Court, accordingly, in their interlocutor of relevancy,
made an exception of this article of the charge<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“November 18. 1754. But find the allegation in the second article of the said indictment charged in these words: “That the pannel swore that at the time there mentioned, the said James Mackindie desired the said Alexander Cook and Alexander Thomson to walk soberly, and make no disturbance;” not relevant, and refuse to admit the same to probation; and repel the haill other defences and exceptions proponed against the said indictment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same doctrine is farther confirmed by the judgment
in the case of Robert Orrock;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A plain False∣hood must be said.</NOTE> who had sworn as arrestee, in
a process of forthcoming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10. &amp; 24. 1711.</NOTE> that he owed Craig, the common
debtor, such a sum by bond, and so much more as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>due
of the price of malt. In truth, he also owed Craig a
farther sum by bill. But he answered to the charge of per∣jury,
that, standing as it did, his oath proved a greater debt
than that for which the arrestment had been used, and that,
having established this against himself, he conceived that he
had substantially exhausted the reference to his oath; so
that in truth there was no prejudice from the omission, either
real or intended. The bill too, (he added), might be omit∣ted
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
from inadvertency, since no special question was asked
about it; as well as, for aught he knew, Craig might have
indorsed the bill to another person, who, and not Craig,
would in that case have been his creditor. The Court found
the libel not relevant to infer the pains of perjury; and in∣deed
it will at least be difficult, in any case, to ground a re∣levant
charge of that crime upon a pure omission<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">On the 6th July 1713, Martin Gray was indicted for perjury, as having, in an oath, omitted to state a year's rent, received by him from a tenement in which he was infest, in an annualrent. This oath was made in a competition with the debtor's widow. The pursuer deserted the prosecution, after debate, and before judgment on the libel.</NOTE></P>
<P>FOR the same reasons which suggested these decisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Libel for Perju∣ry must be spe∣cial.</NOTE> it
is more especially requisite, that in all process for perjury
the prosecutor be not allowed to lay his libel generally, or
in ambiguous terms; since otherwise he would take the cog∣nisance
of the relevancy of the charge to himself, out of
the hands of the Court, to whom of right it belongs. He
has to explain, therefore, wherein it is that the falsehood
lies, and must support (or as we say, <HI>qualify</HI>), his charge with
such a statement of the circumstances of the fact, as justi∣fies
his averment of a false oath having been taken, and shall
ground a clear inference, (if they be proved), concern∣ing
the situation of the pannel's conscience on the occasion.
It was, accordingly, for want of such a detail and expla∣nation,
that one part of the libel was found irrelevant
in the noted case of Lawson of Westertown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27. 1785</NOTE> The charge
against this man was for perjury, in taking the oath of
trust and possession as a freeholder, although he well knew
that he was not in possession of the lands, and that the same
were not his own proper estate, and did not belong to
him, neither <HI>de jure</HI> nor <HI>de facto;</HI> and farther, although he
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
well knew “that his pretended title thereto was nominal and
fictitious, created for the purpose of enabling him to vote
for a member to serve in Parliament.” Now, the first article
of this charge, relative to the matters <HI>of property and pos∣session,</HI>
was found relevant and sent to an assize; being qua∣lified
by a precise allegation of these ouvert and contrary
facts, that certain other persons, (and not the pannel), were in
the right of the freehold subject, property and superiority,
and in the full exercise and enjoyment of all the privileges
and emoluments thereto belonging. But with respect to the
latter part of the dittay, which only set forth in general,
<HI>that he knew the title to be nominal and fictitious,</HI> without any
explanation of these mysterious terms, or any account of the
nature of the pannel's titles, or any detail of facts and cir∣cumstances,
either to fix the meaning by the prosecutor at∣tached
to his charge, or which might enable the Judges to
decide whether it were a just and warrantable meaning;—
this, the Court, for these reasons, found not relevant, and
dismissed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">June 27. 1785. “Find the libel, in so far as it charges that the pannel at the time, and on the occasion therein mentioned, did swear and subscribe the oath required by the act of the 7th of the late King, although he then well knew that he had no right or title to the lands upon which he then claimed to vote, and did accordingly vote, and that the same did not belong to him, nor were his own proper estate; and although he also well knew that the said lands were neither <HI>de jure</HI> nor <HI>de facto</HI> in his possession: But, on the contrary, that the said lands, both property and superiority, <HI>did belong to, and were in the actual possession of the several persons mentioned in the libel, relevant to infer the pains of law,</HI> and remit, &amp;c. And find, that the other article of the libel, which charges that the right upon which the pannel claimed and voted, was nominal and fictitious, created for the purpose of enabling him to vote for a member of Parliament, <HI>is not so qualified</HI> as to import a relevant charge of per∣jury, upon which the pannel may or can be remitted to the knowledge of an assize; and therefore dismiss the libel, in so far as respects that part of the charge.” In the later case of Lieutenant James Fife, where the libel was more fairly and fully drawn in this respect, this article also was found relevant. De∣cember 5. 1796.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132"/>
2. THE falsehood must be affirmed absolutely. That is
to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Falsehood must be said ab∣solutely.</NOTE> the pannel shall not be chargeable with perjury, if
he has sworn doubtfully, or according to his belief or recol∣lection
only, and with relation to such things, about which,
from their distant date or otherwise, he might naturally be
uncertain. For with this limitation any such doctrine must
always be understood; as it is not to be imagined that a per∣son
may incur the guilt, and yet avoid the pains of perjury,
by the thin device of adding this cautious but unmeaning
quality to his oath, when relative to things to of which he could
not but have a full knowledge, and an accurate remembrance.
In the case of George Montgomery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28. 1715. Jan. 19. 1716.</NOTE> this defence was accor∣dingly,
upon debate, repelled; even though the subject of his
oath was a promise alleged to have been made by him upwards
of two years before<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">January 19. 1716. The Lords found, “the said pannel, his having, in manner libelled, openly, publicly, and audibly promised, agreed, or consented to the preference of his father's creditors to all pretences he had to his father's estate, real or personal, by his marriage-settlement; or any other manner of way whatsomever; or the said pannel, his agreeing, or giving consent to give preference to his father's creditors, exclusive of his own pretensions to his fa∣ther's means and estate, by openly declaring his consent in these terms, or in other words or expressions to the same purpose; and also his having judicially, upon oath, denied or contradicted the same, relevant to infer the pains of per∣jury, and repelled the haill defences proponed for the pannel.”</NOTE> It may even be maintained, that an oath
<HI>non memini,</HI> or <HI>nihil novi,</HI> has no absolute privilege, when ap∣plied
to such a case. For what if the thing referred to oath
happened only a few days before; or if shortly before de∣poning,
the pannel gave a full and distinct relation of the
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
whole affair to credible witnesses, who will swear to his
relation of it.</P>
<P>3. THE falsehood must be <HI>wilfully</HI> affirmed; by one who
knows the truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falsehood must by affirmed wil∣fully.</NOTE> and who out of malice, or for some corrupt
and finister purpose, resolves to conceal it. This circumstance
must, therefore, be affirmed in the libel; in like manner as
it must be affirmed in a libel for reset of theft, that the pan∣nel
received the goods, knowing them to be stolen. Owing
to an omission in this respect, the charge was found irrele∣vant
in the case of Gabriel Halliday, in February 1767<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Maclaurin, No. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is a consequence of this principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Calum∣ny or Lawbur∣rows, does it ground charge of Perjury?</NOTE> that there can be
no prosecution for perjury, in certain cases where the oath
is pure matter of opinion and belief, in which the law
means absolutely to trust the person swearing, and leave him
answerable only to his own conscience; or with respect to
which, from the very nature of the thing, no conclusive
evidence can be obtained of his consciousness of the false∣hood.
The oath which comes nearest to this description, is
the oath of calumny: because, how groundless soever the
process may seem to all the world but the pursuer; yet pos∣sibly
to him, under the influence of all the prejudices which
mislead a person in his own cause, it might appear to be such
a process as he had good reason to bring, and to expect to pre∣vail
in. Perhaps, too, it is in the true nature of this pro∣vision
of the law, entirely and ultimately to rest the matter
upon the person's conscience, and no farther to restrain the
freedom of prosecution, than may be done by this safe and
simple expedient. Another illustration is the oath (as it is
called) <HI>in lawburrows;</HI> with respect to which, be the ap∣prehension
of harm ever so chimerical and absurd, it still
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
might be genuine and unaffected in the person who made
oath to that effect, and can scarcely, in any imaginable
way of evidence, be proved to have been otherwise. Be∣sides;
it may be doubted whether the law intends that any
one who will take this oath, which has the effect only of
binding the party complained of more particularly to that
course of conduct which he is at any rate obliged to ob∣serve,
shall be any farther questioned respecting the reality
of his fears. The exception will, however, go no farther,
than to the few cases of this description.</P>
<P>IT is another consequence of the same principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath must be material to the Matter at Issue.</NOTE> that the
oath, in that part of it which is challenged as false, must
be pertinent and material to the point at issue. Meaning
by this, that it must relate to some of those substantial facts,
which may have influence in the decision of the interest
that is at stake, in the proceeding where the oath is made. As
to minute or insignificant particulars, such as could neither
be supposed much to attract the attention of the person swear∣ing,
nor to affect the opinion of those who had to judge of
his oath; any error in these will not be ascribed to malice,
but to the more natural and excusable cause of inadverten∣cy,
or imperfect recollection, or the like.</P>
<P>THE falsehood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falsehood must be on Oath.</NOTE> circumstanced as has been said in point of
substance, must farther, in point of form, be affirmed upon
oath; in contempt of that high presence and solemn ad∣juration,
which ought most powerfully to impress the person
with the awe of his duty: So that he only can be brought to
the bar for perjury, who is hardened against all reverence of
God, as well as all sense of obligation towards his neighbour.
The most formal, and even written <HI>declaration,</HI> is not there∣fore
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
a sufficient ground of prosecution. Probably this
might be one reason, (but the interlocutor is in general
terms), why the libel was found not relevant in the case of
James Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 1709.</NOTE> who was charged with perjury, (among
other offences),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. 1710.</NOTE> as having, on occasion of a certain poll-tax,
solemnly <HI>declared</HI> that his means and estate did not amount
to 500 merks; whereas, he afterwards, in a process of spuil∣zie
at his instance, deponed, that he had lost bonds to a
much greater amount<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“The Lords find the libel, as libelled upon the instructions produced, com∣pared and considered by their Lordships, not relevant.”</P>
<P>This objection was also stated to the libel against Margaret Wood, (Februa∣ry 23. 1631), as far as concerned her declaration of the 9th December, before the Privy Council, which she had afterwards contradicted upon oath; but none of the points in that case were decided.</P>
<P>On the 4th August 1777, Patrick Maccurly was indicted for perjury upon these grounds. He had been precognosced in the view of a criminal trial, and had gi∣ven a declaration very unfavourable to the accused. On the trial he retracted this, and gave a strong testimony in favour of the pannel, who, in consequence was acquitted. Towards the end of his deposition, he was asked, Whether he had ever, on any former occasion, given a different account of the matter? And he swore that he had not. The charge of perjury was laid upon this answer; but after debate, and an order for informations, the diet was, on the 27th November, deserted. It was one strong objection to this charge, that the question put to him on the trial, with reference to his declaration, seems to have been improper, and such as he was not obliged to answer.</P></NOTE>. Farther; though the affirmation
approach more nearly to the resemblance of an oath, as
in the case of one, who in declaring before a Magistrate,
shall of his own accord, call God to witness the truth of his
story, and shall imprecate curses on his head if he have told
a falsehood; yet still there is no proper indictable perjury.
For this is not an oath, nor a part of the record, nor of the
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
proceeding of the Magistrate, but a sudden and intemperate
effusion of the passion of the man; to which, how sinful so∣ever,
the law will not attach the temporal consequences of
perjury, by reason of the precipitate, unguarded, and unneces∣sary
manner, in which the thing is done.</P>
<P>THE only exceptions to this rule, are in the case of Peers,
whose privilege it is to be trusted in certain cases upon their
word of honour; and of Quakers, whom the statute 22d
Geo. II. c. 46. allows, in all civil matters, to give their so∣lemn
affirmation instead of their oath; but under the express
provision of being liable to the pains of perjury, in case of
falsehood.</P>
<P>5. THE oath must be given before some Magistrate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath must be before one ha∣ving right to take it.</NOTE> offi∣cer,
or other person, who has right and authority by law to
exact or receive an oath in that matter. If it be only taken
in the hands of some private person, though in the proper
and judicial words, it has neither that solemnity of proceed∣ing,
(to say nothing of the uncertainty of proof), which is
presumed to put the person making oath upon his guard;
nor is it attended with any of those consequences in point
of interest to the man himself, nor of prejudice to his neigh∣bour,
which are the proofs of the determined malice of the
offender's heart, and which chiefly, and not so much the im∣morality
of the falsehood, are considered by the law, in
dispensing the pains of perjury. By parity of reason, no
account ought to be had in this question, of a voluntary
<HI>affidavit</HI> made to facts before a Magistrate; which is at
least an useless, or rather an improper practice, on this, if
on no other account, that it tends to lessen the reverence
of an oath, by the free employment of it at pleasure of the
party, on every frivolous occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
I KNOW not whether it is farther to be understood, that
the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Oath he before a ci∣vil Court?</NOTE> or person before whom the oath is taken, must be
one whose business is of a civil, and not of a clerical nature.
The law, it may be said, ought to interpose to punish those
perjuries only which interfere with temporal interests, or
are violations of civil order, and will leave such as happen
in the course of ecclesiastical proceedings, to be chastised
with those spiritual censures, which are the proper weapons
of that department. Besides, it may be doubted how far
the oath will be proved by the record of the Spiritual Court.
I find, however, one instance of a person punished for a
false oath which was given in a court of presbytery. On
the 25th April 1601, William Barclay was indicted for
hearing mass, as also for perjury; having sworn before
the Presbytery of Edinburgh, that he was of the Presby∣terian
faith, and having afterwards attended twice at mass.
He came in the King's will; was banished for the hearing
of mass, and declared infamous, and incapable of office, for
the perjury.</P>
<P>6. THE oath must not only be taken before the proper officer,
but also in the due and accustomed form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath must be in the ordinay Form, and com∣plete.</NOTE> in the department
of business to which it relates. Whereby, if it is not re∣duced
into writing, as by law or custom required in that
matter; or, in case of an oath of witness or of party, if it
is omitted to be read over before signing, (but this the pan∣nel
has to prove); or if, being read over, it is omitted to
be signed; or if, upon reading, the person retracts and re∣fuses
to sign, and is therefore dismissed; in all these situa∣tions
the law will not understand that a perjury is commit∣ted.
In some of them, because there is not a finished and
ultimate affirmation of falsehood, adhered to on reflexion,
and at the peril of the deponent; and in others, because the
business has not been conducted with that deliberation and
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
regularity, which, if they had been used, might have deter∣red
the party, or have induced him to retract or explain, be∣fore
retiring from the presence of the Judge. Besides, in
the case of the party not having signed his deposition, (being
a person who can write), it is not duly authenticated to be
his, nor to be accurately taken down; and it cannot therefore
be made a ground of charge against him. In confirmation of
this opinion, Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 7.</NOTE> has cited the case of Mr James
Row. But though there seems to be little doubt of the
soundness of his doctrine, yet it has not the authority of
any judgment that was given in the trial of that case. For,
on examination of the several debates and interlocutors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. &amp; 9. 1665.</NOTE> it
appears that the Justice proceeded on the single ground
of the deposition having been already reduced in the Civil
Court<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“November 21. 1666. The Justice sand the defence and duply proponit for the said Mr James Row pannell relevant, and that the dittay ought not to pass to the knowledge of an assize, in respect the deposition which is the ground of the pursuit is reducit before the Lords of Council and Session, as said is.”</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 10. and Nov. 21. 1666.</NOTE></P>
<P>7.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falsehood to an Oath is not Per∣jury.</NOTE> THESE seem to be a summary of the necessary qualifi∣cations
of the crime of perjury; and according to this ac∣count
of it, it may be questioned whether certain offences
which in common speech, and in a loose sense, receive that
appellation, truly amount to perjury in the estimation of law.
One, for instance, who takes the oaths to Government, and af∣terwards
levies war against, or conspires the death of the King;
or he who takes the oath <HI>de fideli</HI> in an office, and betrays
the trust thereof; either of these persons would in common
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
speech be said to be perjured; as certainly their guilt is
in some measure allied to that of the person who swears
falsely. Yet it is different too; in as much as it does not
lie in affirming a falsehood upon oath, nor even in the falsely
confirming a promise with that assurance, (since the person,
at the time, may have been sincere in what he professed),
but in breaking or forgetting the oath which he has taken.
The crime, in such a case, does not exist, (as it does in every
instance of proper perjury), at the time of the judicial and
solemn act, but is made out by comparing the oath with
the conduct of the man afterwards. In both instances, the
obligation of an oath is indeed contemned, but it is in diffe∣rent
ways. The one offender swears a false oath, and calls
upon his Maker to be witness of the corruption of his heart;
the other is in the event only false, or faithless (I rather
ought to say) to his engagement, undertaken in that solemn
manner.</P>
<P>THE same answer may resolve the question which is agi∣tated
in Mackenzie<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 3.</NOTE>, concerning promissory vows and oaths,
relative to performance of facts or pecuniary obligations;
with this farther difference in favour of the offender, that he
may not have performance in his power, and that circum∣stances
may even happen, which will affect the obligation
after the time when first it is contracted.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do contrary Oaths infer Per∣jury?</NOTE> mention may also be made of the case of
contrary depositions, emitted by the same person at different
times: As where a person upon oath contradicts the account,
which he had formerly sworn to, of the same matter, or re∣tracts
his first deposition, and confesses on oath that it was
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
false. That in this situation, he may be prosecuted for
the falsehood of the first oath, if the true state of the fact
can be shown; and that his second deposition may be used
as a <HI>circumstance</HI> of evidence, (and a strong one it certainly
is), to prove the falsehood of the former; cannot be doubted.
But that, without inquiry concerning the true state of facts,
or any affirmation made on that head, indictment shall lie
for perjury, on the bare face of the two depositions as con∣tradictory,
and as <HI>one or other of them</HI> necessarily false; this
is a different and more debateable position. For it seems es∣sential
to every charge of false oath or perjury, that it set
forth as well what the truth is, as the falsehood that has
been affirmed; which indeed cannot any otherwise appear to
be a falsehood, than by its opposition to the verity of the case,
as it shall be proved. Here, on the contrary, a conviction
would be sought, not of any absolute or certain state of facts,
but, (of which I know no example in the law), in a hypo∣thetical
or alternative form, that by one or other of these
oaths, (but which of the two the libel does not even desire the
jury to find nor to inquire), a perjury has been committed.
Neither, in such a case, have the jury any certainty or suffi∣cient
warrant even of that conclusion; since for aught that
needs be proved to them on such a libel, both depositions may
be equally false. The nature, therefore, of such an offence,
seems to be rather a prevarication or contradiction upon
oath, in like manner as if it happened in the course of a
single deposition. Yet I am obliged to acknowledge, that
according to the aspect of these cases,—that of Galbraith,
July 10. 1605,—of James Bayne, March 10. 1620,—and of
Andrew Turnbull, June 22. 1622,—there seems reason to
believe, that in those days this sort of vacillancy was
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
not distinguished from proper perjury<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The same seems to be taken for granted in the debate on the case of Mar∣garet Wood, February 23. 1631.</NOTE>. Or rather, (for on
this footing, as far as I can discover, the conviction went,
and this was the notion taken up by the lawyers of those
times), the second deposition, assirming the falsehood of the
former, was held to be complete evidence to that effect,
and of itself, a sufficient authority to condemn. I doubt if
it would now be regarded in any other light, than as a cir∣cumstance
or presumption in the case.</P>
<P>8. UNDER the qualifications which have been mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Oath of any sort infers Perjury.</NOTE>
the crime of perjury seems to be applicable in our practice
to false oaths of every description. The most favourable
case, however, to the prosecutor, and that which admits the
most decisive evidence, is where the oath is <HI>super facto pro∣prio:</HI>
as if a witness have sworn, that on such a day he was
at such a place, or that certain things were done by him at
such a time and place; whereas it can be proved that he
was then elsewhere, at a great distance, and differently em∣ployed.
A charge of this sort was sustained against James
Wilson, August 13. 1768. This man had sworn in a trial in
Exchequer, that at a certain time he was on the Stirling-hill
near Peterhead, and saw from thence a certain vessel in a par∣ticular
situation, which he described. The libel charged, that
he was not at that time upon the Stirling-hill, nor even ashore,
but aboard a vessel, and at sea, and so situated as not to be
within the possibility of seeing the ship in question. The
libel was found relevant; but the pannel had a verdict in
his favour. It would be another instance of the same class,
if a person examined as a witness <HI>in initialibus,</HI> should falsely
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
deny his relation to the party who has cited him; or, having
taken a bribe for his evidence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28. 1715.</NOTE> if he swear that he has got
no reward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. 1716.</NOTE> Or again, if any one should deny any recent
and solemn promise or engagement of his own; as in the
case already cited, of George Montgomery.</P>
<P>BUT perjury may equally be committed, though the proof
of it is more difficult, by deposition <HI>super facto alieno.</HI> As if
a witness swear, that at such a time and place he saw John
assault and wound James in the presence of certain persons;
whereas it will be proved by the evidence of those very per∣sons
and others, who were then and there present with the
pannel, and as advantageously situated as he to know the
truth, that no sort of violence happened on that occasion.</P>
<P>FARTHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Oath of Party insers Per∣jury.</NOTE> (though this among the foreign commentators
seems to have been subject of controversy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Clarus maintains the negative. And Boerius in his Deciss. Burd. n. 305. relates a judgment given to that effect <HI>in cur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a omnibus cameris simul congregatis.</HI></NOTE>); indictment may
equally be maintained for perjury, against one who swears
upon reference as a party, as against a witness. The truth
is, that there is far more need of a strong restraint upon a
party swearing, who lies under a strong temptation to be
false in his own favour, than upon a witness, who in ge∣neral
has no interest of his own depending on the issue;
and to remove the dread of punishment, on such an occa∣sion,
would be to destroy one of the great securities which
men have in this way of terminating litigation. Besides;
nothing can justly be held to be transacted by the reference
to oath, but the particular interest which is at stake in the
proceedings where the reference is made. However manifest
the falsehood of the deposition, yet still, as far as concerns
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
that interest, it is absolutely conclusive of the controversy,
and can by no other, even the most decisive evidence, be
controled; nor indeed, will the case be altered in that re∣spect,
to the disadvantage of the party swearing, even after
his conviction of the perjury in a criminal Court; “<HI>Stari
enim religioni debet.</HI>” But the contract on that special issue
cannot deprive the private party, and far less the public
prosecutor, over whose rights the private party has no
power, of his title and interest to vindicate the scandalous
and public wrong. Nay, the private party has the stronger
interest for this very reason, that he has suffered a wrong by
the perjury, which cannot be repaired. This distinction is
clearly indicated in these texts of the Roman law, L. 21. <HI>&amp;

22. Dig. de dolo malo</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>21. Ulpianus, L. 11. ad Edictum—“Quod si deferente me, juraveris et absolutus sis: Postea perjurium suerit ad-probatum: Labeo ait de dolo ac∣tionem in te dandam: Pemponius autem per jus jurandum transactum videri. Quam sententiam Marcel. Lib. 8. Digestorum probat: Stari enim religioni debet.”</P>
<P>22. Paulus, L. 11. ad Edictum.—“<HI>Nam sufficit perjurii poena.</HI>”</P></NOTE>. It is proceeded on in a civil case, re∣ported
by Fountainhall, the case of Yeaman against Roger,
November 12. 1695. In that of George Montgomery, already
mentioned, the criminal process was sustained, after full de∣bate
on the same question; and in the case of Mr Row,
where the prosecution was at instance of an individual, and
was the subject of a long and learned argument, this ob∣jection
(as Mackenzie has observed) was not once thought
worthy to be stirred.</P>
<P>THERE seems reason to doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Does Oath of Party in a Cri∣minal Process?</NOTE> (but no case has happened
to elucidate the question), whether any exception can be ad∣mitted
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
to this rule, even in the case of oath upon reference
in a criminal prosecution. In the modern practice (perhaps it
was not so fully settled in the ancient), no such reference is al∣lowed
to be made, unless in those cases of trespass or delin∣quency,
where the conclusions are not of that high or per∣sonal
nature, from which any strong temptation to perjury
can be presumed to arise. Now, as it is on this account that
the law sustains the transaction of an oath in these situations;
so it must deem the person criminal and inexcusable, who
gives way to the seduction of so low an interest.</P>
<P>BESIDE the oath of party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Party infers it, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> not on reference.</NOTE> which is taken upon reference in
a law-suit, there are many others, competent to be proffered
to a party, or for security required to be taken by him on
particular occasions; and in all these situations also, he
equally swears under the peril of the pains of perjury, in case
of falsehood. To this class belongs the oath of bribery, and
of trust and possession at elections; a debtor's oath to obtain
the benefit of the act of grace; a suspender's oath at passing
his bill upon juratory caution; the oath at obtaining decree
of <HI>cessio bonorum,</HI> or a discharge of debts under the bankrupt
statutes. If, therefore, it can be shown in the first case, that
the voter took a bribe, or gave a back-bond of trust; or in
the fourth case, that the debtor had in his hand and wilfully
withheld a sufficient bond of caution; or in any of the other
cases, that he concealed and reserved considerable funds; he
is alike guilty of perjury, as if he had sworn on the refe∣rence
of an individual. For he has sworn, (which is much
stronger), on the reference and appointment of the law it∣self,
made for the interest and behoof of all concerned, for
reasons of public security or advantage. In the same class
seem to stand all those (it must be confessed too frequent)
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
oaths, which are required to be taken in matters of trade or
revenue. For these, after the statutes which have ordered
them to be taken, and appointed the persons who shall ad∣minister
them, are lawful and necessary oaths in the depart∣ments
of business to which they relate.</P>
<P>LAST of all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaths of Credu∣lity may infer Perjury.</NOTE> no absolute line of distinction can be drawn
in this matter between oaths of opinion, (or credulity as they
are commonly called), and others. Since, whatever may be
the common case, yet instances may be imagined, (though
they cannot be frequent, and when they happen, it will be dif∣ficult
to show the necessary evidence), where the oath is such
in point of form only, and not of substance. For what if a
person have obtained a <HI>meditatione fugae</HI> warrant on his deposi∣tion
to the justice of his claim upon a bill, which bill he has
himself forged: Is he not equally indictable for the perjury,
as for the fabrication? Or, grant that the bill is genuine;
what if it was paid the day before, and was extinguished by a
special discharge, obliging the holder to deliver up the bill
itself as soon as it should be found? Or suppose that a letter of
his is recovered, which expresses his satisfaction at <HI>imposing</HI>
on the Magistrate, and at the prospect he has of revenge on
his enemy, by keeping him six months in goal. Or put the
case of an architect, who, having visited a building by order
of Court, makes oath, that to the best of his skill and judg∣ment
it is good work, and charged at a reasonable rate. If the
building tumble down a few days after, and it can be proved
that the architect received a bribe from the contractor, and
that he afterwards insisted for a still farther gratification on
account of the wrong he had done his conscience; shall not
these circumstances lay open the case to a charge of perjury?
In all these instances, as decisive evidence is shown of the utter
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
falsehood of the pretended opinion and belief, as if the oath
had related to any visible and ordinary fact. Any ground
of hesitation, therefore, on this head, lies only here, that in
the <HI>ordinary</HI> case, clear and conclusive proof of the corrupt
<HI>animus</HI> of the man, without which there can be no conviction
of perjury, is not to be obtained: Not to mention, that in
many instances his mind may have been in that wavering
and uncertain state, on which it may be difficult to say, how
his belief or opinion was.</P>
<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Te∣nor of the false Oath.</NOTE> IN regard to the proof of perjury, (the point which
next will demand our attention),—this is a matter of deli∣cacy,
and with respect to which there is need of more than
ordinary caution; whether on account of the many possible
mistakes of the words themselves, which the pannel is al∣leged
to have used, or the still more numerous ways of mis∣understanding
the speaker's meaning in his use of them, or
the various means of accounting for and reconciling appa∣rent
falsehoods and contradictions. To obviate the first of
those dangers, it is desirable that the tenor of the oath be
established by writing; so as the libel may not only bear
the substance of it, but engross the very words. It is, ac∣cordingly,
the rule of all those cases, where regularly, and
in common form, the oath ought to be reduced to writing,
that no other evidence but the written record, signed with
the party's hand, (or with that of the Judge for him if he
cannot write), is admitted to testify against him on the
charge of perjury. It is even probable that this doctrine
shall be enforced without exception of those more favourable
situations, where the deposition was regularly taken, but has

IT does not, however, follow from the propriety of ob∣serving
this caution in cases of that description,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Te∣nor of the false Oath.</NOTE> that per∣jury
is therefore to pass unpunished in those extensive and
important departments of business, such as trials in the Courts
of Exchequer and Justiciary, where, owing to the contrary
custom of proceeding, no such evidence can be had. By
a proper choice of the witnesses, (who in trials for per∣jury
will always be required to be persons of intelli∣gence,
and of credit above all suspicion), and by due atten∣tion
paid to the accurate examination of them, any mate∣rial
risk of error may be avoided; and in this, as in every
other province of law, that sort of evidence must be taken,
if not in itself quite unworthy of credit, which is the best
that the nature of the case allows. In the practice of Eng∣land,
the conviction of perjury can in most cases be on no
better grounds. This point has twice received a judgment,
after full debate on the objection. First, in the case of Ar∣chibald
Mackillop<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The libel charged, “That he deponed in the words and expressions above libelled, or in other words and expressions of the same meaning, purpose or effect.” In Wilson's case, it charges, that he “took upon him wilfully and falsely to swear <HI>in substance,</HI> that,” &amp;c. And in the end, it charges that he did “knowingly, or willingly, give false evidence, by swearing in the terms, and in the words and expressions above set forth, or in other words and expres∣sions of the same meaning, purpose or effect.” The Court “repel the haill objections offered to the relevancy of the libel.”</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13. and Nov. 18. 1754.</NOTE> indicted for perjury in a criminal trial
in the Court of Justiciary. And afterwards, in the case of
James Wilson indicted for perjury in a trial in Exchequer.
The older case of George Montgomery may even be cited as a
third instance, in which the same decision was deliberate∣ly
given.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 15. 1768. Nov. 28. 1715. Jan. 19. 1719.</NOTE> Though the fact was thus far favourable to the
prosecutor, that the substance (but not the words) of the
promise libelled was engrossed in the minutes of the meeting
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
where it was made; which minutes were produced as an ad∣minicle,
in the trial, but signed only by the preses of the
meeting, and not by the pannel<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">None of these cases issued in a conviction. In Montgomery's case the diet was deserted. Mackillop petitioned for banishment, after the interlocutor re∣pelling his defences and objections; and Wilson was found not guilty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE observations relate to the competent proof of
thetenor of the oath.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving that the Oath is false.</NOTE> As to the way of proving the false∣hood
of that which has been sworn; it holds in the modern
practice, whether the oath be that of party or witness, that
this may equally be by parole testimony, as by writing. For
which there is this obvious and sufficient reason, that the
crime would otherwise pass unpunished; and that those who
suffer by perjury, have not, like the parties to civil con∣tracts,
the power of employing writing on the occasion, and
must therefore be allowed to establish the injury by such
other modes of evidence, as the situation allows. Judging
by what Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit. Perjury, No. 5.</NOTE> has said of this matter, with relation
to the case of Lawrie and Skinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1667.</NOTE> where he was himself
counsel for the prosecutor, it might be conceived that judg∣ment
had there been given to the contrary. But according
to the record, the matter there in debate was no such gene∣ral
question of the competency of parole proof to convict a
witness of perjury, but a different though also important que∣stion,
namely, Whether perjury might be inferred against a
witness, on the single <HI>medium</HI> of contrary and more pregnant
parole proof concerning the facts which he had deponed to,
without any aid of farther circumstances, (for none such are
alluded to in either the libel or debate), to show that the
pannel, equally as the witnesses against him, was in the
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
knowledge of the truth, and wilfully denied it. The <HI>spe∣cies
facti</HI> was this; that in an action at instance of Rigg,
a minister, against Balcanquhall, a landed man, for payment
of vicarage-duties, Lawrie and Skinner, pannels, being used as
witnesses, had sworn that vicarage-tithe was paid by the lands
in question, according to certain rates. Balcanquhall pur∣sued
them for perjury; and purposed (it appears) to make
good his charge, no otherwise than through a fuller and
more pregnant proof by other witnesses, who should depone
to the contrary upon that same matter of the payment and
rates of vicarage. Now this was an attempt in which he
could not expect to be successful. For it is no ground on
which to convict any one of perjury, that he swore to what
is not true, unless he knew and wickedly concealed the truth,
and can by convincing arguments, and plain or unavoidable
inferences, be shown to have conducted himself in that man∣ner.
The guilt is not to be inferred upon the testimony and
affirmation of the pannel one way, and of others to the
contrary, but upon proof of opposite and inconsistent facts,
equally known to the pannel as to the other witnesses, and
wilfully dissembled or denied by him; which corrupt state
of his conscience must be collected from the whole cir∣cumstances
of the case. If, for instance, the pannel be
charged with perjury, in as much as he swore that John did
not fire at James on a certain occasion; evidence must be
given on this indictment, not only of the fact of firing, but of
its being at a time and place when the pannel was present,
and so situated that he could not but see and hear the shot;
which may farther be made evident from his conduct at the
time, and his conversation afterwards, with regard to what
had passed.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150"/>
BUT farther; if it were even true, that the judgment in
the case of Lawrie and Skinner tended to exclude all parole
proof of the falsehood;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of proving that the Oath is false.</NOTE> yet still it could not be denied, that
the same rule has not been followed in later times. The evi∣dence
in the trial, (already cited), of James Wilson, was of
this sort; as it was also proposed to be in that of Mackillop,
where the Court sustained the libel on that footing<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">A petition for banishment prevented the further progress of this trial.</NOTE> On
both occasions, the question had undergone a full debate, in
which the case of Lawrie and Skinner was appealed to.</P>
<P>III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Perjury.</NOTE> THUS much of the nature of the crime of perjury.
Next, of the pains attached by law to the conviction of it.
In the Roman practice, according to Carpsovius<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Quaest. Crim. Pars 1. Quaest. 46. p. 297.</NOTE>, who in
this opinion is followed by some others of the foreign Doctors,
it was a maxim to leave the vindication of perjury, to God
himself, whose Majesty is therein offended, “<HI>Juris jurandi
contempta religio satis Deum habet ultorem.</HI>” But in this he
differs from Mathaeus, and from Voet, who hold, and I
think with better reason, that the wrong was variously pu∣nished;
with infamy, (its natural companion); with banish∣ment,
and with scourging<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">L. 41. God. de Trans. L. ult. Dig. de Crimine Stellionatus. L. 13. § ult. Dig. de Jure jurando.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Perjury.</NOTE> this matter has not been entirely left to the
power of common law, but is the subject of several sta∣tutes,
though expressed in such terms, (which is not unusual
with our enactments), as commit the matter, in the main,
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
to the discretion of the Judge. The only one that is more
absolute, is the statute 1551, c. 19. which has immediate re∣lation
to the crime of bigamy, and orders it to be punished
with the pains of perjury, “That is to say, confiscation of
all their gudes moveable, warding of their persons for
year and day, and langer induring the Queenis will, and
as infamous persons, never able to bruik office, honour,
dignitie, nor benefice in time to come.” But another sta∣tute
of the same year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551, c. 22.</NOTE> “which is directed expressly against
false notars and witnesses,” not only differs from the for∣mer,
in bearing a general clause of “uther pains provided
by the disposition of the commoun law, baith canon, civil,
and statutes of the realm;” but farther, in that part of it
which is special, it has fixed upon higher pains, viz. “Pro∣scription,
banishment, and dismembering of hande or
toung.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">1555, c. 47.</NOTE> A third and a later statute, which relates to
witnesses only, and is entitled to the chief regard, repeats the
special pains which are mentioned in both the others, viz.
Piercing the tongue, incapacity of office, and escheat of move∣ables,
and in like manner concludes with a warrant of “fur∣der
punishment to bee made in their persons, at the sight and
discretion of the Lords, according to the qualitie of the
fault.” The only other law which touches the subject,
is the act 1540, c. 80.; and this is general, ordering the of∣fenders
to be punished “in their persones and gudes, with all
rigour, siclike as it is provided by the disposition of the
common law, baith canon, civil, and statutes of the
realm.”</P>
<P>NOW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pains of Perjury.</NOTE> since all the laws but one, (and this one such as has not
direct relation to the crime of perjury), thus bear an allowance
of farther and indefinite pains, which the latest of all the
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
laws expressly commits to the discretion of the Court; it
should seem to be the just result, that the pains of perjury
are arbitrary, <HI>pro gravitate admissi,</HI> and, in a strong case,
may be carried any length that is short of loss of life or
limb. The custom, accordingly, and construction of the law,
has been to that effect: Nay, in the older practice, the discre∣tion
of the Court did not even acknowledge any limitation,
in cases of aggravated or repeated guilt. For, on the 15th
March 1605, Alexander Wastland was sentenced to be hanged
for perjury, at the same time that Alexander Croy, the infor∣mer
on the occasion, but also convicted, was sentenced to be
scourged. On the 8th March 1615, three persons, named Black∣lock,
Dunlop, and Watt, being convicted (it appears) of three
acts of perjury, had sentence of death; at the same time
that other four, less notorious offenders, viz. Hamilton,
Jack, Moffat, and Bogle, were sentenced to be scourged, burnt
in the cheek, and banished. A third instance of capital
doom for perjury, is the judgment on Robert Ker and James
Young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1622.</NOTE> who were convicted of two acts, and were ordered to
be hanged. David Turnbull, convicted of one act upon the
same libel with them, had his tongue bored with a hot iron,
and was banished under pain of death in case of return<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The following seem to be the chief convictions of perjury, beside those which are occasionally mentioned in the text. William Galbraith, July 10. 1605, pilloried and banished, under pain of death in case of return. June 13. 1561, Mungo Steven∣son; his tongue bored, his moveables escheated, and declared incapable of office; this in terms of and on narrative of the act 1555, c. 47. January 30. 1650, John Wilson and John Sinclair set upon the trone, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ear nailed thereto, their moveables escheated, and declared infamous. <HI>Eod. d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> william Dickson, and Arthur Stewart, same sentence, without the naisin of the ear.

January 8. 1736, John Blackadder, de∣clared infamous, his moveables escheated, and exposed at the Cross, with a label on his breast, and his ear nailed to a post. John Bell, July 15. 1762, pillotied and declared infamous. John Lees, February 20. 1773, declared infamous. pil∣loried, and transported for seven years. Alexander Menzies, February 12. 1790, transported for seven years, and banished Scotland for life▪ All these, but the first, by the sentence of the Court of Session. See Acts of Sederunt of these dates.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153"/>
THE case where this rigour seems to be most suitable, is
that of perjury in a capital trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Perjury in a capital trial.</NOTE> if the trial issues in the con∣viction
and execution of the accused. But though this may,
perhaps, be law, (as certainly the deliberation, malignity,
and enormity of the act are not surpassed by that of any
other crime for which our law requires the atonement of
the offender's life); yet, as it is rather under the name of
conspiracy, or of murder, that such a deed falls to be
charged, I shall not farther insist on it in this place.</P>
<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jurisdiction in trial for Perjury.</NOTE> THE cognisance of perjury is only peculiar to the
Criminal Court, when it is pursued in the form of an original
and proper libel. For if the crime is committed, or comes
to light, in the course of process before the Lords of Session,
they too have power, and even of their own motion, sum∣marily
to try the matter upon the face of the proceedings
which lie before them, and straightway to punish the attempt
which is thus made to pervert the justice, and impose upon
the wisdom of the Court.</P>
<P>THE right of prosecution for perjury is common,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title to prose∣cute for Perjury.</NOTE> as in
the case of other crimes, to the public prosecutor, and to the
private party, shewing a sufficient interest in the event: as
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
if he has been convicted of a crime; has lost his civil cause;
has been thrown into goal as <HI>in meditatione fugae;</HI> has failed
in his claim to a title of honour; or has been worsted in
a competition for a seat in Parliament; and thus has suffered
prejudice by the false oath. The title last mentioned, was
sustained on the 27th June 1785, in the case of Cumin of
Altyre against John Lawson of Westertown, for taking the
oath of trust and possession as a freeholder; the libel setting
forth that the pannel falsely took the oath, and voted for a
person who was returned in preference to the pursuer.</P>
<P>BUT the law will sustain even a weaker interest than in
any of these cases; such as that of the person to whose pre∣judice
the false oath is intended, or against whom it is pe∣culiarly
directed, though the particular injury that was in
view have not ensued. For this prejudice the complainer
notwithstanding suffers, that he finds himself the object of
enmity and malice, and is for the time alarmed with respect
to the fate of the interest which he has at stake; not to
mention, that the false oath may in many instances be at∣tended
with a prejudice in point of fame, which will not
even be effaced by the successful issue of the proceeding in
which the perjury is committed. For these reasons, he
is entitled to feel resentment of the wrong, (in like man∣ner
as one whose life has been attempted by thrusting or
firing at him, though he have not been wounded); and in
the one case, equally as in the other, beside the gratification
of this natural and just feeling, by having himself a part
in bringing the offender to justice, (which is itself such an
interest as the law pays some regard to), he has the farther
substantial interest of securing himself by means of a con∣viction,
against any repetition of the like attempt on the
part of this person against him.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155"/>
IN general, it is to interests of this personal and immedi∣ate
kind, such as belong to a man by reason of his peculiar
quality or situation, and not to such which are common to
a whole class or description of persons, that our practice at∣tends,
in deciding on the pretensions of an individual to
prosecute for this or any other crime. It is true, that in
the case of James Fife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 5. 1796.</NOTE> the Court were of opinion that the
title of freeholder on the roll of any county, equally as
that of candidate for election, was a sufficient title to pro∣secute
for perjury committed by taking the oath of trust and
possession. But that decision is in nowise inconsistent with
the general rule which has been mentioned. Because the
whole train of election-laws proceed upon the notion, that
every freeholder of any county has such an interest in the
choice of its representative, as entitles him to use all reme∣dies
for guarding the purity of its roll of electors.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER be the nature of the private interest and
title;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The title must be stated in the Libel.</NOTE> it ought to be stated and made apparent on the face
of the libel, which must cohere and stand by its own
strength, and can receive no sort of aid from such things as
are not affirmed, but only referred to or left to be implied.
It was on account of a defect of this kind that the Court
dismissed the first libel against William Leslie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29. 1785.</NOTE> in which it
was not charged that the pannel voted against the prosecu∣tor,
nor even that he voted at all.</P>
<P>V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prevarication upon Oath.</NOTE> BEFORE I close this chapter, it will not be amiss to add
a word or two concerning perevarication upon oath, or
the wilful concealment of the truth; which is next in de∣gree
to perjury, and seems chiefly to differ from it in the
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
inferior boldness and resolution of the offender, who, though
desirous to mislead the Judge, and make a false impression,
has rather chosen to compass this object in the way of an
artful and chicaning oath, than by the direct averment
of plain falsehoods; or, if he has ventured upon any such,
has not persisted in them till the close of his oath. This
sort of guilt is chiefly to be gathered from the evasive and
equivocal answers of the witness, the inconsistency of the
different parts of his oath, and his affected ignorance and
want of memory, with respect to things which it behoves
him to know; more especially if he is at last driven out of all
these shifts, and is constrained to emit a true, though, taken
on the whole, an incoherent and contradictory deposition.
As a scandalous contempt of the presence of the Court, and
of the reverence of an oath, this offence may be summarily
punished in the judicature where it is done, (and it rather
appears only at that time, and before that Court), either
with imprisonment, or, if the case be more flagrant, with
infamy and the pillory. Of which there are many examples
as well in the books of sederunt, as of adjounal<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Robert Logan, August 6. 1767, declared infamous, and put on the pillory. Christian Crawford, December 24. 1760, the like.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF SUBORNATION OF PERJURY.</HEAD>
<P>OUR statutes for the restraint of perjury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII.</NOTE> have ranked in
the same degree of guilt, and have subjected to the same
penalties, the false witness and those who suborn, seduce or
corrupt him. And indeed if any distinction were to be made,
it could not be to the advantage of the latter; who, joined to
the same unjust and profligate purpose as to his ultimate ob∣ject,
and even a higher measure of contrivance and delibe∣ration,
has the additional guilt of corrupting the morals of
another person; and herein shews an equal disregard of his
neighbour, whom he initiates in so ruinous a course of
wickedness, and of the public, who may so deeply suffer by
the future practices of his pupil.</P>
<P>SUBORNATION of perjury seems only to be committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suborner must succeed in sedu∣cing.</NOTE> if
the person solicited shall yield to the seduction, and swear
to the falsehood which has been concerted. And in this case
where the earnestness of the exertion to seduce is vouched by
the success, it seems to be all one, what the unlawful means
be, by which the pannel has prevailed; whether the usual
course of good deed and reward, or the promise of such, or
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
the use of violence and threats of mischief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUBORNATION OF PERJURY.</NOTE> or the plain insi∣nuation
of danger and evil consequence if the witness shall
refuse. For according to the situation, temper and circum∣stances
of the person practised on, any of these motives may
equally serve the purpose; and whichever of them the offen∣der
employs, his malice is still the same. The interlocutor
is to that effect in the case of Charles Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31. 1710. Jan. 1736.</NOTE> and in that of
Macdonell of Barrisdale.</P>
<P>NEITHER will it alter the crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Express com∣pact on a false∣hood not neces∣sary.</NOTE> that the suborner does
not in direct terms covenant with the witness upon a false
story, which is openly concerted and avowed between them
as such; if the same thing is done in substance, more artfully
and indirectly: as for instance, if without asking any que∣stion
at the intended witness about the fact, the suborner en∣gages
him to swear according to a written narrative or state
of the matter which he puts into his hands to guide him,
and which he well knows to be false. This was found to
be a relevant charge in the case of Charles Hay, tried in
July 1710<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the pannel's inducing or enticing any person to swear, or to sign a set form of words prepared and offered in writ; or to swear to, or give a sign∣ed declaration concerning particular points of fact, inserring a crime, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault or delinquency against the pursuers, or either of them, without inquiring whether the person dealt with, knew the truth of the matter of fact to which he was to subscribe or swear, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and damages; and, <HI>separatim,</HI> find the pannel's enticing or seducing any person to swear, or to sign any particular matter of fact, by offering money or other reward, or by threatenings, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment and damages.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to Sub∣orn, is a point of dittay.</NOTE> though it is only in this way that the proper crime of
subornation is committed, it is not the law, (nor would it be a
salutary state of things), that the attempt to suborn is there∣fore
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
not a crime, nor liable to any censure. If the witness
has once engaged, the guilt on the part of the seducer, in its
own nature is complete; and a crime <HI>in suo genere</HI> is commit∣ted,
though no oath be actually given, (in like manner, as
where a pistol is fired with intent to kill, though it neither
kill nor wound); whether this be owing to timidity or re∣morse
on the part of the witness, or to some accident or ob∣jection,
which hinders the receiving of his testimony. Nay,
the same shall even hold to the effect of inflicting a suitable,
but lower pain, though the persons practised on should stea∣dily
resist the solicitation, and never even for the time, nor
in appearance comply. For here, equally as in the case of a
false oath made by the witness, but disregarded by the Judge,
<HI>per alium stetit,</HI> that the ultimate intended evil did not fol∣low.
The conspiracy has had its course as far as depended
on the suborner; and it were a plain encouragement to such
attempts, so dangerous to the course of justice, and of such
evil example, if they were to pass without the notice of the
law, and could only then be punished, when they happened
to succeed. One thing however seems necessary to be at∣tended
to, with respect to cases of this description; that the
solicitation, which in these circumstances has not the sup∣port
of any actual perjury, or engagement for perjury, to
serve as an evidence in confirmation of it, must have been
used in such an ouvert and palpable shape, as testifies the
earnest and serious determination of the pannel to seduce.</P>
<P>WE have three decisions sustaining action on attempts of
this description.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to Sub∣orn, is a point of dittay.</NOTE> First in the case of Charles Hay, July 31.
1710; who being sent by the Commissioners of Customs to
inquire concerning certain suspected frauds and malversa∣tions
in the revenue, had practised with sundry persons, but
except in one instance without success, (and the declaration
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
of that one person was not even produced), to cause them
make false affidavits, or declarations, tending to the preju∣dice
of the pursuers; or to cause them swear to or sign such
affidavits or declarations, by him produced to them. Next,
in the case of Macdonell of Barrisdale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. 1736.</NOTE> who was accused of
suborning, or endeavouring to suborn witnesses, towards the
conviction of certain persons on a charge of theft; but in
which process, none of the persons solicited did make oath;
neither does the libel allege, with respect to any of them,
that they ever engaged, or truly intended to serve his pur∣pose<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Found the pannel, his having, at any of the times and places libelled, <HI>induced, or endeavoured to induce by rewards, or promises of rewards, or by threats or violence, or any unlawful means,</HI> any of the persons mentioned in the libel, to bear false witness against the pursuers, or any of them, in any process <HI>intented, or to be intented against them;</HI> or that the pannel is art and part thereof, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, damages and expences: But for alleviation, allowed the pannel to prove that all or any of the witnesses alleged to be practised upon, did voluntarily, before the respective crimes al∣leged, declare, that the pursuers, or any of them, were accessory to the steal∣ing Culdair's cattle, and remitted,” &amp;c. February 2. 1736.</NOTE>.
The attempt in the third case, that of James Hog,
minister at Caputh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1738.</NOTE> and James Souter<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>July 14. 1738. The Lords “found the libel relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, damages and expences, and repelled the haill defences proponed for the pannels.”</P>
<P>There is a fourth instance of relevancy found for this and other the like pro∣ceedings, tending to corrupt the sources of evidence, in the case of Robert Stuart, and others, in July 1713. The Court, on the 3d of August 1713, found “the said pannels, or any of them, while the foresaid house of Inchdruer was set on fire, their cursing of Elisabeth Porter, and bruising her against the wall, and threatening to cast her into the fire, if she would not swear such oaths as the said pannels tendered to her, that she would not discover what was done, re∣levant to infer an arbitrary punishment: And, <HI>separatim,</HI> find the said pannels, their meeting with the said Elisabeth Porter, at the house of, &amp;c. and endea∣vouring to corrupt her, by offering her money to go off to Ireland, also rele∣vant to infer an arbitrary punishment: And, <HI>separatim,</HI> find the pannels, their endeavouring to persuade the said Elisabeth Porter, while they were prisoners in the tolbooth of Banff or Aberdeen, to deny or retract what she had declared concerning the alleged murder, robbery and fire-raising, above mentioned, also relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P></NOTE>, was also to suborn
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
witnesses in support of a criminal prosecution; and in this
instance, not only did none of the persons practised on give tes∣timony
in the trial, but, as the libel itself has stated in al∣most
every article, they strenuously resisted the pannel's so∣licitations.
In the two latter cases, the objection was moved,
but was repelled, that the solicitation had been with a view
to a process, not depending at the time, but intended only
to be brought. And of all the three it may be remarked,
that the prosecution was at instance of a private party, whose
interest was even in these circumstances sustained without
hesitation; on the footing probably of his natural resent∣ment
for such an attempt, peculiarly directed against him,
and the just desire on his part of deterring a renewal of the
like malicious practices in future.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 15. 1795.</NOTE> In the later case of Jar∣dine
against De la Motte, the Court were, however, of opi∣nion,
that though the Lord Advocate might prosecute in
this situation, the private party could not.</P>
<P>IT is easy to imagine many other cases of the procuring of
falsehood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All practices to procure false evi∣dence are pu∣nishable.</NOTE> in which, if there be some doubt of the propriety
of a charge of <HI>subornation,</HI> there shall, however, be none, of
competently and severely punishing the offence, as a falsehood,
or a conspiracy and machination, or under some other more
detailed description, such as may suit the circumstances of
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
the case. One noted instance of this, the reader has al∣ready
been made acquainted with, under the head of false∣hood;
the case of Campbell of Burnbank,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 21. 28. 30. 31. 1721.</NOTE> who was senten∣ced
to infamy and transportation, for a conspiracy to de∣stroy
the same, and take away the state of a married wo∣man,
by contriving deceitful evidence against her. Libel
was also found relevant for the procuring of a false charge,
though of an inferior kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1710.</NOTE> in the case of Charles Isaack∣son,
Robert Forrest, and Mary Hamilton, who were accused
thus<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">August 1. 1710. “The Lords found Mary Hamilton, pannel, her having, in the pangs of child-birth, and before the kirk session of Edinburgh, or Canongate, declared that Mr Isaackson was the father of her child, and afterward, for money or other reward, retracting the said declaration, and giving out Sir Alexander Rigby, pursuer, to be the father, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment against her; and likewise found Robert Forrest, and Charles Isaackson, pan∣nels, their suborning and enticing the said Mary Hamilton to accuse the said Sir Alexander Rigby, pursuer, of a fact inferring the crime of notour adulte∣ry▪ by giving or promising her money or other reward, and for that effect diclating a declaration in writing, to be subscribed by the said Mary Hamil∣ton, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment against them or either of them.”</NOTE>: that she having born a child to Isaackson, and ha∣ving
informed against him as the father, she afterwards, for
money received from him, and at his instigation and that
of Forrest, signed a written declaration, falsely giving the
child to Sir Alexander Rigby, a married man. This was
found relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment against all
of them; but the charge did not go to any farther trial<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Notice may also be taken of the libel against Monteath, elder and younger of Carriber, January 14. 1678. Certain witnesses had deponed in the improbation of a deed, and the pannels were charged, that they, by threatening the witnesses with prosecution, and by shewing them pretended criminal letters, had suborned or concussed them to give in a bill to the Lords of Session, falsely retracting their depositions, and praying leave to amend them for their conscience sake. This case was debated, but not decided. The libel concluded for the pains of death; but was restricted in the course of the debate to the acts of Parliament, and cus∣tom of the Court. The charge was not prosecuted to any issue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163"/>
WITH respect to the pains of subornation; they are the
same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for Subornation. 1540, c. 80. 1551, c. 22. and 1555, c. 47. Mar. 15. 1605. Mar. 8. 1615.</NOTE> and are appointed by the same statutes, as those of
perjury. And of old, in cases of aggravated and repeated
guilt, the highest vengeance of the law was in like manner
applied to it. As in the case of Alexander Cheyne; in the case
of Graham of Long-Boddom, who suffered death along with
Blacklock, Dunlop, and Watt, the persons whom he had sub∣orned;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. 1622.</NOTE>
and in the case of Andrew Turnbull, the suborner of
Ker and Young, who have been mentioned as sharing the
same fate.</P>
<P>THIS rigorous construction of the law has not, however, been
used in any later case. In the Court of Justiciary, the Rev.
Mr James Hog and Thomas Souter, being convicted of repeat∣ed
attempts to suborn, were declared infamous, found liable
in L. 250 of damages and expences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. 1738.</NOTE> and banished Scotland
for life. The like sentence (with the exception of damages)
was passed in the Court of Session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. 1739.</NOTE> on Neil Macvicar, for an
attempt to suborn, and other foul practices of the like
sort;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 21. 1745.</NOTE> as also on James Kerr, guilty of gross and notorious
subornation of perjury. In a suitable case, the banishment
might, however, in the same manner as for perjury, be of
the higher sort, to the foreign plantations.</P>
<P>IT may be observed in the close of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices of this sort summarily tried in some cases.</NOTE> that if in the course
of any criminal trial, or of the preparations for it, and re∣lative
proceedings, any practice or malversation tending to
mislead, constrain, or corrupt the witnesses, or to destroy,
suppress, or alter the evidence of other kinds, is discovered
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
to have taken place; whether on the part of the prosecutor
or the pannel, or even of their friends or favourers, or by
one witness with respect to another; this, either on com∣plaint
to the Court, or, in some of these situations, on the
knowledge and motion of the Court themselves, may be
summarily punished with fine or imprisonment, according
to the degree of the offence. And this <HI>in poenam</HI> of such
interference with the course of justice, as well as to deter
the completion or farther prosecution of the evil purpose,
pending the trial, if not yet concluded. There is a late ex∣ample
of this, in the sentence of imprisonment upon the Re∣verend
Mr James Dun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 11. 1793.</NOTE> for destroying part of a sederunt∣book,
which was called for in a precognition, with a view to
the raising of a criminal process.</P>
<P>THE same holds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices to the prejudice of a fair trial are pu∣nishable.</NOTE> and for the like reasons, with respect to
all those practices, equally hostile (though in a different
form) to the course of justice, and equally subversive
of the principles of a fair trial, which tend to biass or
preoccupy the public, and by consequence the jury, with
respect to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the proprie∣ty
of the prosecution, or the justice of the law touching the
offence which is to be tried. On all these points, it is fit that
the assizers come into Court with their minds pure of any im∣pression,
either of favour or dislike, and open to the public and
judicial information of those who have the ability and the
right to instruct them. On the 23d June 1777, John Gil∣kie,
a writer, for a misdemeanour of this kind, was sent
to prison for a month, and was ordered to find caution for his
good behaviour. This man was agent for the private pro∣secutor
in a case of murder; and after commitment of the
pannels, and even after execution of the criminal letters
against them, he had ventured to publish sundry memorials,
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
advertisements, and addresses commenting on the case, and
tending to prepossess the public with an opinion of their
guilt<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Court on this occasion found, “That such publications are a high indignity to this Court, and most dangerous to the course of justice, as tending to prepossess and inflame the minds of the country against the persons accu∣sed, and thereby obstruct the course of a fair trial.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SIMILAR attempt had been made, though with a more
excusable intention, in the month of May 1785, on occasion
of the trial of Ewan Macewan at Perth, for murder. The
agent for this pannel, after service of the indictment on him,
had composed and published a sort of narrative on his part,
giving an account of the charge, and of the circumstances of
the case. The Judges inflicted a fine both on the agent and
the printer, and inserted in the record a strong censure of
all such indecent interferences with the course of criminal
justice<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the composing, printing, and publishing the case of Ewan Mac∣ewan, after he was served with his indictment, and on the eve of his trial be∣fore this Court, was calculated to prepossess the minds of the people, and of the jury, as well with regard to the former proceedings, as the trial of the in∣dictment then served upon him; find, that such conduct is derogatory to the authority of the Court, and dangerous to parties, whether prosecutors or pan∣nels, and subversive of the principles of a fair trial: But, in respect of the candid confession of the above Thomas Mitchell and Robert Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rison, and that this misconduct may have proceeded from ignorance or inattention to the consequences; therefore,” &amp;c.—May 6. 1785.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF DEFORCEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE course of justice may be obstructed, not only du∣ring
process,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of Pu∣nishment.</NOTE> by attempts to over-reach the wisdom of
the Judges, but also extrajudicially, by hinderance or resis∣tance
of the officers of the law in the execution of their duty.
Our practice annexes the appellation of <HI>deforcement</HI> to this of∣fence;
an ossence in former times among the most frequent of
any in this country of Scotland, but which in the considera∣tion
of the law, is of no mean degree of guilt. The reprehen∣sion
due to it, is not only on account of the high damage
which may attend the hinderance in the particular instance;
but also, and more especially, because it is a contempt of the
authority of the King, as represented in his courts of justice,
and in the course of legal process; and is thereby a matter
of evil and most dangerous example, which tends to the un∣hinging
of government, and to intercept the benefits of the
state of civil union. The servants and executors of the law,
how low soever their rank, are part of the great plan of judi∣cial
establishment; and are the necessary instruments of the
courts of justice, without whose assistance the orders of those
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
tribunals would be fruitless.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII.</NOTE> And having, for this important
purpose, been regularly installed by public authority, and un∣der
surety for their proper deportment, they have a just claim
to the obedience of all the lieges in their office, and to the same
inviolability of person as the Magistrates in whose service
they minister; and who are truly themselves insulted, when
their orders are resisted in the hands of the persons to whom
they have committed them for execution. To the officer, in∣deed,
this protection is far more requisite than to his supe∣riors;
whose higher stations in life, and the apparatus which
attends on them in the performance of their functions, are a
security, for the most part, against personal violence or abuse;
beside that they have no part in the actual execution of any
sentence or order, at which season chiefly the authority of
the law is in danger of being spurned. In order, there∣fore,
to guard the persons of those useful ministers, from the
injuries to which they are so much exposed; as well as to pre∣vent
the continual broils and tumults which would other∣wise
ensue; it is necessary that all hinderance and moles∣tation
of them in their office be set down as a high crime,
and strictly forbidden under pain of severe correction.</P>
<P>I. THE following things seem to be necessary towards pu∣nishment
of the offender in terms of the statutes against
deforcement.</P>
<P>1. THE person deforced must be a <HI>lawful officer;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officer hin∣dered must be <HI>lawful.</HI></NOTE> one of the
regular and proper executors of that sort of diligence or war∣rant
which is hindered. If either he is an ordinary individual,
who of his own authority, has arrogated to himself the cha∣racter
of servant of the law; or if he is only <HI>in cursu</HI> of being
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
appointed (as a messenger who has not yet found caution);
or having once been in the office, if he has been deposed or
suspended; or being a lawful officer, if he is meddling with
business which does not belong to his commission, (as in the
case of a sheriff-officer executing letters under the Signet, or
of a constable executing the Sheriff's precept, or in the case
of either constable or sheriff-officer going out of his proper
bounds, in which case he is but as an individual); in all
these and the like situations, even though they were attend∣ed
with a common belief and error of the neighbourhood as
to the quality of the man, (which in civil questions might
perhaps be considered), there can be no proper deforcement
in the resistance of these his unwarrantable, and, as they
must here be accounted, tortious proceedings. It may even
be doubted, whether by special address of warrant to a pri∣vate
person <HI>nominatim,</HI> and in a case where the urgency of
the business authorises that manner of proceeding, the man
becomes an officer, (though any one who invades him shall
certainly be punishable more or less), to the effect of ground∣ing
process for the statutory pains of deforcement. It is to
be considered, that there are many cases, where, purely in
virtue of the situation, every <HI>bystander</HI> has the same autho∣rity,
as by address of warrant to him <HI>nominatim,</HI> straightway
to take and detain the person of a delinquent; and yet it will
scarcely be alleged, that in these situations also, the indivi∣dual
is in this respect invested with the full privilege of an
officer of the law.</P>
<P>2. THE officer must not only be possessed of a lawful com∣mission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must be hinder∣ed in an official act.</NOTE>
but he must be in the execution of something which
appertains to that commission, at the time when he is hinder∣ed
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
or molested. For the offence is not to the individual,
but to the officer, and to the law, which is violated in his
person. He has not, therefore, the protection of the statu∣tory
pains, in every common broil he may get engaged in.
Neither does he enjoy it on occasion even of every act
which he does by order of a Magistrate, if it is not a proper
act of solemn or official duty, but such a piece of service as
needs no warrant, and which one who is not an officer
might perform: As if a sheriff-officer be carrying a packet
of letters from the Sheriff, or have been sent to a certain
quarter of the county, to make private inquiries about such
a crime, and is, on account of that errand, waylaid and
beaten, and has his packet taken from him. For, though he
may have been chosen for this employment, by reason of
his station, and his connection with the Magistrate; yet the
authority and powers of his office are nowise concerned nor
exerted in the performance of it; nor is he pointed out
therein to the public as one of that employment. The of∣fence
is, therefore, only an assault and battery, though aggra∣vated
certainly by the station of the sufferer, and by the
offender's motive. In short, deforcement only lies in the
hindering of those formal and solemn proceedings, (<HI>actus le∣gitimi</HI>),
for which written authorities are given, and which
it belongs only to an officer of the law to carry through.</P>
<P>THE same limitation will hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must have begun to do his official act.</NOTE> in cases even of a less re∣mote
connection with the duty of the man as an officer, and
where the occasion of molesting him is in some measure sub∣servient
or preparatory to the doing of an official act. If a
messenger be attacked in his own house, and have his letters
of caption taken from him, when preparing to set out upon
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
a journey, to put them in execution; or if he be met half
way upon the road, and be there stopped and stripped of his
diligence, by persons who have information of his errand;
in neither of these cases are the invaders guilty of deforce∣ment:
because there is not an inchoated execution of the di∣ligence,
nor any assumption (as <HI>in actu proximo</HI> to execution)
of the official character, under which only the officer can
be deforced. In illustration of this remark, I may refer to
the case (for the same rule will govern in that department)
of John Wallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 26. 1730.</NOTE> indicted for assault on an officer of the
revenue. The charge was thus: that John Young, a tide∣water,
having espied a vessel hovering upon the coast, and
boats making off to it from shore, with the purpose, as he
suspected of running goods; he concealed himself at a conve∣nient
station in a field of corn, there to lie and take observa∣tion
of what might happen. But in this situation, being dis∣covered
by the pannel and his associates, who dealt in sinug∣gling,
and who knew the man and his purpose, he was on that
account severely bruised and beaten by them, and was com∣pelled,
with threats and imprecations, to take an oath in their
hands, that none of their goods should be seized. Yet this
was only libelled at common law, as an aggravated violence
or riot<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">That where by the laws and practice of this, and all other well governed realms, <HI>riot and violence,</HI> and the <HI>invading, beating or bruising,</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laves or other weapons, any of our lieges, without the least cause or colour of provocation, are atrocious crimes, and severely punishable, especially when aggravated by being done and committed to the great effusion of blood, and in a barbarous and merciless manner, upon those who are more immediately under the protec∣tion of the law, such as officers of the revenue in the discharge of the trust re∣posed in them; and when such violence and barbarity are used as a mean to extort imprecations, from the person so maltreated, upon himself, if he faith∣fully executed his office, and performed the duty thereof; yet true it is,” &amp;c.</NOTE>, and not on any of the statutes against deforcement of
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
the revenue-officers: because, how near soever the connec∣tion
of this occasion with the trust of the man's office, as
charged in the libel; yet it was no part of any special act of
seizure, conveyance, or the like, to which alone the protec∣tion
of those statutes applies.</P>
<P>THE same direction will equally apply to such injuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must be engaged in doing his offi∣cial act.</NOTE> as
the officer suffers at some distance of time and place after he
has been deforced, and when he has in consequence put off
his array of office, and abandoned all thought of persisting
in his diligence; being, for instance, met on his journey
homeward, by another set of people, but engaged in the
same interest, who insult and abuse him. This distinction
was accordingly made in the case of Janet Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 16. 1728.</NOTE> who was
charged with deforcing a messenger in the town of Tranent,
and afterwards instigating a rabble, who followed him and
his party to Prestonpans and other places, on his way to
Edinburgh, and there abused and beat him. Now, the first
part of this charge was found relevant as for deforcement;
the other, as for a riot and beating only.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Found that Janet Hay, pannel, having the time libelled, in the town of Tranent, deforced the complainer George Innes, in the eexcution of letters of caption against Walter Allan, merchant in Tranent, the said George having, at the time his blazon displayed, and his wand of peace in his hand; or that she the pannel was art and part thereof, relevant to inser <HI>the pains of deforce∣ment;</HI> as also, the said Lords found the said Janet Hay, pannel, having on the day libelled, raised and outhounded a mob in the town of Tranent against the complainers, and the said mob having <HI>followed them out of own, and thereafter having beat the said complainers,</HI> or either of them, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to in∣fer an <HI>arbitrary punishment.</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sufficient if the officer be <HI>in actu proximo</HI> to do his duty.</NOTE> however, necessary, that the first form of the
execution be actually done or doing at the time of the hin∣derance,
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
if the messenger have assumed his official character,
and entered on his commission; being in near and immedi∣ate
preparation <HI>(in actu proximo)</HI> to adhibit the first forms,
if he shall be permitted. Thus it is a deforcement, if, when
the messenger, bearing letters of caption, has come near the
debtor's house, and is upon the private passage to it, and has
displayed his blazon, he is met by a host of people, who
drive him off on notice of his errand, and will not suffer him
to see the debtor, nor to approach the door, nor to show his
letters. And the same seems to be law in a case of poind∣ing,
if instantly upon entering the debtor's field, in order to
poind his cattle there, the messenger is invaded and driven
off before he can begin to read the letters; which is the first
step of his office. This was the character of the following
cases; in all of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. 1679. June 6. &amp; 20. 1715.</NOTE> (and in the last, after debate upon
the point),<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. and Aug. 6. 1722.</NOTE> a relevancy was sustained on the charge of de∣forcement,
—the case of Rorie Macniel and others<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In Macniel's case, the pannels had garisoned the house or fortalice, and had fired upon the messenger, bearer of the summons, from the battlements, as soon as he came in front of the building, and would not suffer him to approach the door, so as to affix his copy of summons; which he left, in consequence, upon the grounds of the lands.</P>
<P>In Sutherland's case, the libel charged, that upon the messenger's approach to the house, to execute a caption, a posse of armed men sallied out, menaced and hindered him to enter the house.</P>
<P>In Campbeli's case, it bore, that the messenger, with a blazon displayed, had gone to the house where Campbell was at the time, to take him upon caption, and had there come in fight of him at or in the house, and was advancing to the house to make him prisoner, when he was invaded, molested and opposed by armed men, who threatened death, if he persisted. The pannel objected, that the messenger had not taken, nor even touched Campbell; and that the libel did not condescend upon any qualification from which it could be inferred, that he was in the actual execution of his office, or <HI>in actu proximo</HI> of apprehending or touching.</P></NOTE>,—of Wil∣liam
Sutherland and others,—and of Sir James Campbell of

<P><PB N="172" REF="173"/>
3. IT is not sussicient that the officer be entered on his
commission at the time when he is molested,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officer must be
proceeding law∣fully.</NOTE> unless he be also
proceeding therein, in due and lawful manner.</P>
<P>THIS head includes sundry articles of duty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must notify that he is an Officer.</NOTE> And, <HI>first,</HI>
it lies with the officer to notify his quality of servant of
the law; in order that those concerned, who may be quite
ignorant of him and his office, may be warned of their
duty, and of the consequences of resistance. As to what
shall be esteemed a due compliance in this particular; thus
far is certain, that in the case of messengers and constables,
whose blazon and baton are the known badges and outward
testimonies of their commission, the showing of these, which
are given them for this very purpose, is sufficient proclama∣tion
of the office-bearer; and will be held to put every
man on his guard, that it is at his own peril, if he shall dis∣pute
the authority of the person who produces them. Pro∣bably
too, if the messenger or constable be acting in a quar∣ter
of the country where he is not known; or in the case of
resistance by persons who are strangers to him; the want of
these, the visible symbols of his office, which in such a case
he ought to have upon him, will scarcely be supplied by his
verbal assertion of the fact to the opposers, (which may ei∣ther
be true or false for aught that is known to them); nor
even by his shewing of the diligence, which may happen to
be in the hands of one who is not an officer of the law. The
display of the blazon is, therefore, among the ordinary cir∣cumstances,
which are set forth in a libel for deforcement.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
NEVERTHELESS; that this is indispensible on all occa∣sions,
and without exception even of those situations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Display of Bla∣zon; if indis∣pensible.</NOTE> where
the reasons of requiring such a thing do not apply, is not
so probable in itself; neither does it seem to be settled
by any judgments, which have yet been pronounced. These
<HI>insignia</HI> of office are given the officers, (and in that view most
properly), for their protection among strangers, and in all
situations, the newest and most distant, where their duty
may chance to call them. But in the case of a person who
is of the officer's acquaintance, or whose whole behavour at
the time shows, that he knows the man and his employment,
there seems to be no need of any farther notification of that
matter; nor any good reason why such a one should be allowed
to indulge in blood and violence, under the affected pretence
of fear of his personal safety, or of indignation at the attempt
upon his property or freedom. The messenger is such, without,
as well as with his blazon; and if he tell this person, who
already knows him for a messenger, that he comes for an
official purpose, and also show him his diligence or war∣rant;
then is the man in possession of all the facts which
are requisite to the regulation of his conduct on the occa∣sion;
and he cannot therefore be free of the guilt of a
wilful contempt. Notice may accordingly be taken of these
libels, which do not bear the display of blazon, and yet are
found relevant; the libel against Margaret Yule, June 21.
1680; against Anne Elphinston, February 14. 1687; and
against Macneil of Bara, July 28. 1679. In the last instance,
that circumstance seems, however, to have been the subject
of proof<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was found, in the Court of Session, <HI>January</HI> 18. 1699, <HI>(Lord Kinnaird),</HI> that the messenger executing caption, need not show his blazon, till he has ap∣prehended prehended the debtor. In the case of <HI>Harse against Fork, March</HI> 1685, (Har∣carse), it was found that a messenger, though known to be such, might be de∣forced, being without his blazon. But the reporter observes, that there was a specialty in the case. Neither is it said, that the messenger had in any way inti∣mated the purpose of his coming.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175"/>
4. THOUGH the party well know that the person is a messen∣ger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must notify that he is acting offi∣cially.</NOTE>
he may not be aware that he has come there in his office
at the time: It lies, therefore, with the messenger, before pro∣ceeding,
duly to warn him in this article too; for which pur∣pose,
the natural and most advantageous course appears to
be, by making mention of the particular duty on which he is
come, and by exhibition of his diligence or warrant. It
cannot, however, be laid down for law, that there is no
deforcement, unless where this precaution is observed. On
the contrary, it has more than once been proceeded on, and
seems indeed to be a point of settled doctrine, that the dis∣play
of blazon is itself warning to the party, not only of the
bearer's office of messenger, but of his coming for some
purpose of official execution. Seeing the messenger in the
array of his office; if he have any doubt of his errand, or of
his authority, the party is bound to question it in a peace∣able
and orderly manner, and to satisfy himself, by call∣ing
for the warrant, that such exists and is there, and con∣cerning
its nature and extent. If, instead of following
this dutiful course, he straightway, and without asking a
question, assault the messenger; he shews a determination to
deforce at all events, and excludes any plea he might other∣wise
have had, if, upon requisition, the diligence had not
been forthcoming. The objection taken on this ground, of
the officer's omission to exhibit his diligence, has been repel∣led
in two cases of deforcement of caption;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 19. &amp; 26. 1672.</NOTE> that of Gordon
of Braco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. and Aug. 6. 1722.</NOTE> and of Campbell of Lawers: As also, in two cases
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
of deforcement of poinding; that of William Sutherland<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In Sutherland's case, it was pleaded, “That neither did this messenger shew his letters of horning and poinding, or caption; neither did he in anywise inti∣mate or declare the purpose of his coming, either by word or by any overt act.”</P>
<P>In Campbell's case, the defence was, “That the messenger did not tell Sawers that he had a caption, or was going to apprehend him; and that since he did not tell him, the pannel could not know his errand, and consequently could not be guilty of deforcement in resisting him.” And again, “<HI>It</HI> is not said in the li∣bel, that the messenger apprehended the pannel, or touched him with the wand of peace, or that he so much as showed his letters of caption.” It is answered, <HI>inter alia,</HI> “It is sufficient that it is libelled, the messenger <HI>with his blazon dis∣played,</HI> was proceeding to do his duty: If Sawers did not know the messen∣ger's errand, Why was he so ready to deforce him violently? He does not pre∣tend that he called for the messenger's caption, or that it was refused.”</P></NOTE>
and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6. &amp; 20. 1715.</NOTE> and of James Hamilton and others; and in all
of these cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 27. 1725. and Jan. 3. 1726.</NOTE> upon very deliberate consideration.</P>
<P>IT seems to be equally agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must show his diligence, <HI>if re∣quired.</HI></NOTE> on the other part, that if
the messenger, being required to show his warrant, shall re∣fuse
or decline to give satisfaction in that particular, and
shall nevertheless persist in the execution of it, it is not
a deforcement to oppose him. The party is authorised
to believe in that case, that in truth he has not the war∣rant
with him, and by consequence that he does wrong in
attempting to put it in force. In the debate on all the cases
above mentioned, it seems accordingly to be yielded, that
the messenger, if he had been required to show his letters,
was under the necessity of complying, and could not be
justified if he refused. And such a refusal, along with other
circumstances, is found relevant to elide the libel, in the
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
case of James Edmonstone and others<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the following defence proponed for David and Charles Edmonstouns and Libertoun of Sedden, that one or other of the saids pannels <HI>desired to know of the messenger upon what account he came there, and he refused to tell them,</HI> and that he and his accomplices beat them before they made any resistance, relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to elide the deforcement as to these three.”</NOTE>, as also in that of
George and John Sinclair<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“But find the defence alleged for the defenders, that James Sutherland <HI>was not known to be a sheriff-officer, and that no warrant was produced by him from the Sheriff, when required,</HI> for seizing John Oigg; and also, that defence, that the wool alleged to be taken with him, was in the father's possession, and of∣fered out to be spun before the time the wool was stole from Mr Robert Dun∣bar, relevant to elide that part of the libel.”</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 7. 1695. Nov. 20. 1699.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE following limitations of this rule seem however very
necessary to be attended to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitations of that rule.</NOTE> First, though the messenger must
show, he is not obliged to part with his diligence, nor to put it
into the hands of the party; who might detain it from him
or destroy it. Even if he give it to any impartial by stander
to examine, it seems to be matter of indulgence rather than
otherwise; for the officer, who is trusted with the diligence,
and with the interest of his employer, may justly refuse to
put his warrant in any case into the power of another. 2dly,
Even the showing of the warrant is to be understood as
chiefly applicable to the case of requisition by the party
himself, or those who are lawfully interested for him; and
this limitation will more especially hold good, if the chal∣lenge
does not happen in the entry of the execution, but
at some after period in the progress of it, when the offi∣cer
is already in possession of his object. If the debtor
has submited to the messenger bearing caption against him,
and is on his way to goal, or has gone to a place of
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
custody for the time; or if the officer has completed the forms
of poinding, of which the very first is the reading of the let∣ters,
and is carrying off the goods to a place of safety; or
even if he has made the first apprizing, and is conveying the
goods to the market-cross; he is not afterwards obliged to an∣swer
the questions of every new comer, and still less of a pro∣miseuous
rabble, concerning his authority and commission.
It is the duty of every man who finds an officer of the law in
this state of settled possession, to stand by and not to meddle
with that which does not concern him, whether it be right
or wrong; and for which, if it be wrong, those who are inte∣rested
can have sure redress, without his interference. For
this reason, if for no other, the objection taken upon the
failure to show the letters, was not good in the said case of
Hamilton in 1725; where one part of the charge was for vio∣lent
opposition to a poinding by a disorderly multitude, after
performance of the first apprizing, and when the goods were
some miles upon the way to the nearest burgh. 3dly, It is
certain, in regard to the precaution on the officer's part, of
telling the purpose for which he is come, that this is only ne∣cessary
on the supposition, that the party is or may be igno∣rant
in that respect. For if it clearly appear from the con∣duct
of the offender and his friends, that they well under∣stood,
and had previous notice of the officer's errand, (which
will be evident if they attack him straightway on his appear∣ance,
without asking questions, or giving time for any expla∣nation),
the charge of deforcement will be equally good, as
if more deliberation had been used on either part.</P>
<P>5. THE officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officer must pro∣ceed in lawful Manner.</NOTE> having duly introduced himself and his
commission, has also to proceed in the performance of it
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
after the manner by law directed; being only then in his
office when he exercises it lawfully, and being obliged to
know as much of the law, as concerns the matter of the se∣veral
diligences, and the proper time and circumstances of
putting them to execution. If therefore, a messenger shall
execute letters of caption upon Sunday, or after seeing a sist
or suspension of them; or if any officer shall attempt to
poind plough-goods in time of labour, or any goods in
the night, or to carry off corn in prejudice of the landlord,
who objects his hypothec; or if he shall break open doors,
to poind, without letters of open doors: In any of these
cases, he may be resisted without the guilt of deforcement.
The same must be said of him who shall poind goods in con∣tempt
of a written conveyance of them, and refuse the claim∣ant's
oath thereupon, when tendered: as was decided in
the case of Purves against Craw, March 20. 1676, and in
that of Porteous of Hawkshaw, July 8. 1700<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the first defence, of the messenger or his assistants, beginning to <HI>gather the poind before sun-rising,</HI> and the last defence, <HI>of producing Hawkshaw's dispo∣sition</HI> at the market-cross of Peebles, <HI>and craving back the goods,</HI> both rele∣vant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to elide the libel.”</NOTE>, and of Mag∣dalen

Most of the other
illustrations also rest upon judgments of Court. There is

poinding in the night; the case of Dick against Sands, Decem∣ber

of plough-goods in time of labour; the case of John
Stewart, July 28. 1701<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">“Sustains the defence, that the pannel as landlord had right to stop the poinding till he was paid of a year's rent; and finds the said defence acknow∣ledged by the libel itself.”</NOTE>, and that of Thomas Ross and

<P>The diet in this case was afterwards deserted; and on a new libel, raised on the same matter, against the same persons, the same interlocutor was given, (Nov. 24. 1706), but with this material alteration in the last article: “Repel the reply, in respect the term of payment to the master was not then come, and that there was not sufficient security offered to the master for the year's rent;” on which the pursuers refuse to insist, and the diet is again deserted.</P></NOTE>, as to the defence upon the master's
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
hypothec; and that of Mary Yule, June 21. 1680<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel relevant, as also the first defence and reply, and remits all to the knowledge of an assize.”</NOTE>, and of
Major Burnet, August 4. 1697<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Sustains the defence proponed for the pannels; that there was a sist inti∣mated to the messenger the day before the deforcement libelled; and likewise sustains the reply relevant to take off the said defence, that the pursuers inti∣mated to the pannels the Lords deliverance taking off the said sist, and that the pannels used violence thereafter.”</NOTE>, as to the shewing of sus∣pension.</P>
<P>WE cannot add to this list of lawful defences, that of pay∣ment
tendered to the officer upon the spot; unless that person
have special power, which ordinarily he has not, to act as
agent also, and to receive and discharge the debt. Nay, which
is still stronger, he is not to desist by reason even of any plea
of compromise, compensation, or previous payment and sa∣tisfaction
of the claim, unless it be vouched by an explicit
discharge applied to that very <HI>diligence,</HI> and the grounds of it;
for neither is the officer a judge of such pleas, nor is the
time of execution a fit season in which to propose them. The
defence of previous payment of the debt was repelled in the
case of David Simpson<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">“Ordains the dittay to pass to the knowledge of an-assize, notwithstanding the first, second, and third defences.” The third defence was that of previous payment of the tack-duty, for which the poinding was used.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. 1662.</NOTE> And the question with respect to
offer of payment made to the messenger, is one of those
which were settled in the case of Francis Duguid and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1673.</NOTE>
where the defences were repelled, and the libel found re∣levant
as laid.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
BEFORE we proceed to another article, it will be proper to
add a caution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excess is punish∣able, though the Officer err.</NOTE> lest it be conceived, that, in those cases where
the irregular proceedings of the officer hinder him to main∣tain
action for deforcement, the party has therefore the un∣controlled
freedom of every sort of excess and outrage against
the man, on such an occasion. Such resistance as is necessary
to hinder the accomplishment of the officer's disorderly pur∣pose
against his goods or person, he cannot be questioned
in law for making: But if, taking advantage of some mis∣take
or inaccuracy, which is more likely to proceed from
ignorance than from any wrongful intention, he shall give way
to rage and revenge, and indulge in acts of cruelty against
the person of this trespasser after he has abandoned his pro∣ject;
certainly these are punishable in this as in every other
instance, and the sufferer may have his amends as an indi∣vidual,
in a prosecution for the assault and beating. Nay,
if the officer shall be killed in the course of such malicious
and intemperate pursuit of him, it will depend upon the
liberties which he had previously taken with the goods or
person of the killer, and the length he had gone in the
unlawful prosecution of his diligence, whether the killing
of him may not even amount to murder. For, what ir∣regularity
of the diligence or execution of it shall deprive
the officer of his defence of justifiable homicide, if he
shall kill the party resisting; and what shall cut him short
of his process for deforcement against that party; and what
shall justify or shall excuse the party, if he shall maim or
kill the officer: These are three distinct inquiries, not in∣deed
quite without connection, but as certainly not sit to be
determined by one and the same rule; since they relate to
three several courses of conduct, which proceed from very dif∣ferent
habits of mind in the offender. Simply to hinder the
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
officer from executing his irregular diligence, is one case;
wantonly or unnecessarily to maim or kill him in the execu∣tion
of that diligence, is another; and for the officer to
kill the party in the execution of it, is a third; each of
which has its suitable decision, drawn from the degree of
what is done.</P>
<P>6. AS the officer must be in his duty at the time he is ob∣structed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obstruction must relate to the Of∣ficer's Duty.</NOTE>
so must the obstruction relate to his duty, and be
made with the purpose, and upon the lawless resolution, of
hindering him to perform it. That is to say; if, in the course
of executing any diligence, an occasional quarrel shall arise
between the messenger, or any of his concurrents, and
a bystander, who conceives himself to be injured or in∣sulted
on the spot; or if one who bears enmity to the mes∣senger,
and who finds the opportunity convenient, shall
take advantage of it to invade him for the satisfying
of his malice; in neither of these cases is the offender
guilty of deforcement, but of battery or assault only; though
the injury be even of that degree, which disables the officer
to proceed with his diligence. For it is not inflicted, (where∣in
lies the character of deforcement), with the presumptuous
purpose of stopping the process of the law. The libel was
accordingly drawn as for an assault, in the case of Alexan∣der
Innes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The pannel's information says, “The defender could easily prove that he had got provocation, in as much as in a public company the present pursuer was pleased to term him a notorious liar in his absence; and this was the first accidental meeting they had thereafter.”</P>
<P>November 14. “The Lords find, that the pannel having at the time and place libelled, assaulted James Anderson the complainer, by beating, bruising or wounding him, especially when he was assisting a messenger or messengers, while in the execution of his or their offices, relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment, and repelled the haill defences proponed for the pannel.”</P>
<P>Nov. 19. “The jury found, that James Anderson, &amp;c. was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat by the pannel Alexander Innes, &amp;c. over the head, with a drawn sword, at and about the time, and at the place libelled; and found that the pannel gave not the least disturbance to John Ogilvie the messenger, or to his concurrences, in the execution of their office.” He was decerned to pay L. 40 Sterling in name of fine, damages, and expences, and to find caution to keep the complainer skaith∣less.</P></NOTE> of Dunkinty;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1723.</NOTE> who was charged with the beating
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
of James Anderson, a notary, when attending, in that ca∣pacity,
on a messenger, who had come to the house of Innes,
to take some third person upon letters of caption. In the
case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. 1662.</NOTE> too, of David Simpson, it was admitted to proof and
sent to the assize as a good defence, that the assault was an
accidental quarrel and interference, and in nowise on ac∣count
of the poinding<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Ordains the dittay to pass to the knowledge of an assize, notwithstanding the first, second, and third defences, and duplies; and remits the fourth defence, (that above alluded to), and duply, to the consideration of an assize; and de∣clares that they will receive the defender's probation thereof.” The libel was found proved, and nothing was returned as to the defence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>7. LAST of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What degree of violence necessa∣ry to this crime.</NOTE> as to the requisite degree of hinderance
and molestation. The words of the statute 1592, c. 152. in
that passage where it describes the offence, have given oc∣casion
to argue, that there is no deforcement unless the offi∣cer
be assaulted to the effusion of his blood<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The words are, “Or in putting of decrees to due execution be deforced in doing of the same, <HI>or be molested, invaded or pursued to the effusion of their blood.</HI>”</NOTE>. But it is
certain, that no such narrow, and indeed pernicious con∣struction
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
of the law, has ever been received into practice.
On the contrary; as reason and policy require, the crime
has always been held to be committed, wherever, either
by any sort of actual violence, or by plain shew and prepa∣ration
of mischief, or by the wilful opposing of real impedi∣ments
in his way, the officer has been hindered, or dis∣abled,
from proceeding with the execution of his duty.
Understanding always, that, upon the whole case, his alarm
is reasonable; and that he does not construe the mere
clamour and bustle, which are incident to such occasions,
into resistance of his proceedings. Thus, it is plainly a
deforcement, if the messenger be fired at or pursued with
mortal weapons, though he be nowise hurt nor wound∣ed;
as in Macniel's case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1679. June 1715. July 25. 1719.</NOTE> and in that of Sutherland, and
that of Forbes of Tolquhon<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 25. “The jury find, that the pannel William Forbes, &amp;c. did refuse access to the mansion-house of Tolquhon, and opposed by himself or others, those authorised and empowered for executing the letters of ejection, by throw∣ing stones, threatening to fire, and by firing from the top of the said house.” Sentence passed for the statutory pains on the 28th July.</NOTE>. Or if the opposers shall
assail and beat him off with stones, and other missile instru∣ments,
intended (no matter though without success) to hurt
him in his body. Or if he is opposed by an armed posse, (as
in the case of Campbell of Lawers, in July 1722), who shew
their arms, and forbid him access to the house, and warn
him to be gone. Or, (as in the case of Hamilton and others,
in December 1725), if a tumultuous crowd shall take the
poinded goods out of his possession; or, after he has got en∣trance
of the house, and has begun to the forms of poinding,
if he is by main force pushed out again, and finds the
doors made fast against him. Or again, if the opposers shall
forcibly lock up and confine the officer, or lay hold of and
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
master him, so that he cannot come at the debtor, (which
is charged against one of the pannels in Duguid's case);<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1673.</NOTE>
or if they shall pull the debtor out of his hands, being al∣ready
in his custody; or shall break up the door of the cham∣ber
where the debtor is, in order to take him from the
officer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 16. &amp; 23. 1724.</NOTE> which is the charge in the case of Ramsay. In
all these, and the like cases of violent hinderance and mo∣lestation,
the opposer is guilty of deforcement, though the
officer escape unhurt on the occasion. Accordingly, in the
case of Robert Harries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9. &amp; 12. 1667.</NOTE> where the verdict only finds him
“guilty and culpable of <HI>troubling</HI> the messenger James Mur∣ray,
his assistants in the execution of his office,” the sta∣tutory
pains are nevertheless decreed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>He was also found “guilty and culpable of wearing arms contrair to the act of Parliament lybelled.” But this was a separate charge upon the statutes touching that matter.</P>
<P>On the 13th December 1708, Patrick Gordon was indicted at instance of Lady St Foord, for deforcement, spuilzie, &amp;c. on this ground, <HI>inter alia,</HI> “That when the Lady, upon a decree recovered against him, had raised a caption, and by virtue thereof caused a messenger apprehend him; after the messenger had touched him with his wand of peace, and made him his prisoner, he swore, God damn him, if he would not by himself, and others his accomplices, tie the said messenger neck and heel, and throw him in a dungeon, whereby the mes∣senger being terrisied, broke his wand of peace, and displayed his blazon, and protested for a deforcement?” The Lords (Dec. 20.) found this, among other articles of charge, relevant to infer an <HI>arbitrary pain,</HI> “That the said Captain Patrick Gordon, when the messenger touched him with his wand of peace, by virtue of a caption at the Lady's instance, used and emitted the threatening ex∣pressions lybelled, after the messenger had exhibited and intimated to him the off taking of the sist on his bill of suspension;” <HI>or,</HI> &amp;c. “January 4. 1709. The Jury found it proven, that when the messenger did apprehend the above named Captain Gordon, and touched him with the wand of peace, he threaten∣ed to put him in a dungeon, and that after the messenger had intimate to him the removal of his sist.”</P>
<P>January 17. 1709. He was sined in L. 1000 Scots, of which 1450 merks to the Lady in name of damages and expences, and 50 merks to be paid to the under∣keeper of the Parliament-house, and to lie in prison during the Lords pleasure.</P>
<P>If this conviction and sentence were upon the footing of a proper deforcement, which rather appears to be the case, it is a strong illustration of the doctrine in the text.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187"/>
THIS, in truth, is a salutary, or rather a necessary construc∣tion
of the law. For if it behoved the officer to persist,
to the suffering of some great injury in his person, and if he
could only then desist with safety to the interest of his em∣ployer,
when he should be in instant danger of his life;
either his trade would be a state of constant warfare, or his
office would soon fall into contempt.</P>
<P>ONE circumstance must,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No deforcement, unless the dili∣gence be hinder∣ed.</NOTE> however, attend the violence in
every case of deforcement: It must be such as hinders the
diligence to be completed. Though the officer be wound∣ed,
and even be in danger of his life; if he nevertheless
persist and fully accomplish his object, he cannot prose∣cute
for deforcement, but only for the attempt to deforce,
or for the assault and real injury, of which it may justly be
charged as an aggravation, that they were committed with
such a purpose. It is no less clear in favour of the officer,
that, after he has once been constrained to desert his ser∣vice
and quit the field, the offender cannot by any re∣pentance,
nor even by actual restitution of the effects, nor
by surrender of the debtor's person, do away his fault,
so as to exclude the King's interest, or even that of the pri∣vate
party, to prosecute for the public wrong. For, as has
been said, the law more considers the contempt of authority
in this matter, than the patrimonial damage. Such a defence
was pleaded in the aforesaid case of Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1725. and Jan. 1726.</NOTE> &amp;c. and seems
to have been entirely disregarded.</P>
<P>8. UNDER these limitations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime relates all official execu∣tions.</NOTE> deforcement is held to be
committed, with little distinction as to the sort of warrant
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
that is hindered; whether it be letters under the King's
signet, or the precept of an inferior court, as in the case
of the Sinclairs, in 1699. For the act 1592 has spoken ge∣nerally,
of all <HI>persons whatsomever,</HI> and of the <HI>precepts of all
Judges within this realm.</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This seems to have been found even with respect to a baron's officer. See Dict. of Decis. vol. i. p. 231.</NOTE>. It is also committed, whether the
hinderance be of the execution of diligence, such as letters
of poinding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1718. and July 1719.</NOTE> caption, or ejection, (as in the case of Forbes
of Tolquhon);<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1679.</NOTE> or of a mere summons, as in Macniel's case;
or of summary warrant to apprehend and imprison, as in
the case of the Sinclairs, who had deforced a sheriff's offi∣cer<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">November 20. 1699. “As to the second member of the libel, anent the <HI>deforcing</HI> of the Sheriff's officer of Caithness, found that member of the libel relevant to infer the <HI>pains of law.</HI>” It does not appear from the debate, that any doubt was entertained of the application of the law to such officers. The plea was, that the man was not a Sheriff's officer.</NOTE>
in the taking of a thief. In general, it may be com∣mitted
by the hindering of any solemn act <HI>(actus legitimus)</HI>
of an officer of the law, such as sequestration, intimation or
the like, which has a known appellation, and proceeds under
the authority of a formal written warrant<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">On the 7th January 1712, John Costine of Glensoan, and others, were indict∣ed at instance of the Lord Advocate, the Stewart of Kirkcudbright and his officer, <HI>on the statutes against deforcement,</HI> for hindering the stewart-officer to levy the laidner-mart cow; that is, a cow, which by custom, the Stewart had a right to le∣vy from each parish of the stewartry, taking which he would, and leaving the owner to his relief according to a certain customary rate and fashion, from the other heritors of the parish. The pannel pleaded, that deforcement could not be committed by hinderance of a warrant of this sort, which was not of a ju∣dicial nature, nor in the course of process or justice. The Lords (January 14. 1712), “found the libel relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” The pan∣nels were convicted, fined, and bound over to keep the peace.</NOTE>. Also; which
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
might seem to be more doubtful, it has twice been resolved,
that the charge is good, though the messenger be himself
assignee to the debt, and to the diligence which is hindered.
I allude to the case of David Simpson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 6. 1662. June 4. 1688.</NOTE> and that of Beatson
of Powguid<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The objection was thus, “It being acknowledged by the libel, that Sheills was creditor in the debt, whereupon the diligence proceeded, Sheills could not execute letters at his own instance.” All the desences were repelled, and the case was sent to an assize.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE like broad rule must be laid down,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may be guilty of De∣forcement.</NOTE> with respect to the
persons who are capable of contracting the guilt of this of∣fence.
The words of the act 1592, might indeed seem to
consine the guilt to the party himself who is the object of
the warrant, and to such persons whom he shall instigate or
procure; but it has ever been held, that any person is equal∣ly
liable to the statutory pains, who takes a part in the ob∣struction,
whether this be done of his own choice, or by the
procurement of those concerned.</P>
<P>WHAT degree of concern in the hinderance shall be suffi∣cient
to involve any one as art and part of deforcement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Deforcement.</NOTE> is
not determined by any peculiar rule, but according to the
same principles of common sense, which govern that matter
in other cases. In the trial of Hugh Fraser of Kilbordie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. 1675.</NOTE>
the verdict found him “guilty of the crime of deforce∣ment
lybelled, in swa far as he commandit his natural son
Alexander Frazer to come up and relieve him, and give
them their reward and spare them not.” Upon which he
had sentence to pay 500 merks to the party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 1675. Dec. 15. &amp; 26. 1698.</NOTE> and 200 to the
messenger. In the case of Thomas Mitchell, bailie of Aber∣deen,
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
and others, the charge was upon this ground against
Mitchell; that being required, as a Magistrate, to assist the
messenger against a rabble, who had taken his prisoner out
of his hands, he, under frivolous shifts and pretences, de∣clined
to relieve him, and left him on the spot exposed to
their resentment; and that having in a short time returned,
and being of new required to assist, he again slighted the
proposal, and, after refusing to let instruments be taken on
the occasion, withdrew a second time from the scene of dis∣turbance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 26. 1698.</NOTE>
The Lords “found the libel relevant as libelled
to infer the pains of the acts of Parliament against de∣forcement
of messengers.” That this tacit encourage∣ment
would not, however, be reputed an accession in the
case of any ordinary person, appears from the case so often
quoted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1673.</NOTE> of the Duguids of Auchinove. For, with respect to
Francis Duguid <HI>senior,</HI> it was found not relevant, that the
debtor was his son-in-law, and rode off upon this pannel's
horse; and that being present at the time of the deforce∣ment,
which was executed by his sons and servants, he did
not interfere nor command them to desist.</P>
<P>II. THE provisions which our Legislature have made for
repressing this dangerous offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corporal Pains for Deforce∣ment.</NOTE> are rather liable to be
censured as insufficient, (that is, in their application to fla∣grant
cases), than as rigorous or excessive; as indeed
in former times, such was the condition of society and go∣vernment
in this country, as could hardly be expected to
train the inhabitants to a due sense of the enormity of
the fault. It is true, that if we were to judge by the words
of the act 1581, c. 118. which subjects the offenders to es∣cheat
of moveables, and to punishment of their persons <HI>at
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
our Sovereign Lord's will;</HI> and still more to judge by the
words of the statute 1587, c. 85. which declares, “that <HI>their
lives</HI> and gudes shall be at the King's will therefor,” we
might be led to conclude that the Legislature meant to give
a power of applying even the highest pains, if the occasion
should require it. But it does not appear, that these statutes
have in any instance been pleaded to any higher effect, than
that of inflicting an arbitrary punishment; and even this
does not seem to have been ever carried farther than impri∣sonment,
in addition to the pecuniary pains. The following
are examples of sentence to that effect: The case of Gordon
of Braco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 2. &amp; 6. 1665.</NOTE> (February 1672);—of Francis Duguid, (December
1673);<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 13. 1669.</NOTE>—of William Watson;—of Robert French;—and of
John Macleod, (in July 1759), who was sent to prison for
a month.</P>
<P>THE patrimonial pains are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pecuniary Pains of Deforcement.</NOTE> 1st, the escheat of moveables;
introduced by the act 1581, c. 118. and afterwards more
particularly regulated by the act 1592, c. 152.; which di∣directs
that one half of the escheat shall be to the King,
(who formerly drew the whole), and the other to the party,
purchaser of the proceedings which have been hindered.
2dly, The act 1581 has said, that the party shall be first paid
of his debt and his expences, “to be heichly taxed by the
said Lords,” and that this interest of his shall burden
and be preferable to the King's interest in the moveable
escheat. To secure this provision of the one statute, and ac∣commodate
it to the other, which gives the party right to half
of the escheat, the sentence taxes the debt and charges to a
certain sum; and declares, that if the party's half of the
escheat shall fall short of his payment of that sum, then the
King's half shall be burdened with the balance. This is the
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
course that was taken in the case of Ramsay<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And in case the said half adjudged to the complainer shall not amount to the debt contained in the caption, upon which the deforcement proceeded, and the sum of 300 merks Scots, which is hereby taxed as the expences of plea, then the said Lords decern and declare, That the half of the saids moveables escheated to the King, shall be burdened with the payment of what the other half shall fall short of the foresaid sums.” November 27. 1724.</NOTE>, and in that of
Macleod,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 27. 1724.</NOTE> in July 1759<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And in case the said half, adjudged to them shall not amount to the debt contained in the letters of caption, upon which the deforcement proceeded; and to the sum of L. 30 Sterling, which is hereby taxed as the expence of pro∣cess, and in <HI>name of damages,</HI> then the said Lords decern and declare, That the half of the said moveables escheated to the King, shall be burdened with the payment of what the other half shall fall short of the said sums.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it may happen that even the entire escheat is not equal
to this burden;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pecuniary Pains of Deforcement.</NOTE> and whether it was intended that the pannel
should be personally liable for the debt, so as to give the cre∣ditor
a title to recover it out of his heritage also and other
estate, might not be absolutely clear on the words of the sta∣tute
1581.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 203.</NOTE> Mackenzie, in his observations on it, has, how∣ever
said, (and the thing in itself is right and equitable), that
this was the intention of the act; and in his Criminal Trea∣tise,
he takes notice of the case of French, where personal
action for payment was sustained: As it was more lately, in
the case of Campbell against Cowans<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">I mention this case on the authority of Lord Royston's Notes, p. 134.</NOTE>. 3dly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1727.</NOTE> The act 1581
has farther authorised the awarding of a sum of money, to
the party in name of damages and interest; and which, in
like manner as the debt and expences, shall be a burden on the
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
King's interest in the escheat. Award was given to that effect
in the case of Hugh Fraser; of Forbes of Tolquhon; and
of John Macleod; all of them cases already cited.</P>
<P>IT has sometimes happened, that instead of taking the pre∣cise
course pointed out by the statutes, which puts the private
party to the troublesome task of gathering in the moveables,
the Court have at once decreed for a certain sum, in name
of fine or damages, or both, in lieu of all escheat and other
penalties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1679.</NOTE> James Macneil had sentence to pay L. 1000 Scots,
of which 500 merks to the King, and 1000 to the party;
and in the case of Joseph Watson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 28. 1707.</NOTE> decree was given for pay∣ment
of the debt, and a fine of 500 merks, “in name of
damages and expences, and for the pursuer's interest in
the said Joseph Watson's escheat.”</P>
<P>III. THE competent prosecutors for deforcement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may Pro∣secute for De∣forcement.</NOTE> are
<HI>1st,</HI> The Lord Advocate; <HI>2dly,</HI> The Messenger, and the Lord
Lyon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1673.</NOTE> whose title was sustained in the case of Duguid, with∣out
concurrence of the party employer; <HI>3dly,</HI> The party em∣ployer,
who has a double interest; by reason of the damage
he sustains in the hindering of his diligence, and by reason
of his concern in the escheat.</P>
<P>THE competent Court for the prosecution, in case of the
deforcement of any of the King's officers, is either the
Court of Session or Justiciary; whereof the former seems to
have its jurisdiction in this matter recognised, rather than
introduced, by the statute 1581. With respect to the infe∣rior
courts, of what soever degree; each of them has right to
vindicate its own authority, and to protect its servants from
injury in their office<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Haddington, tit. Sheriff—Royston's Notes, p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>
TOUCHING the form of the libel. It may be proper to re∣mark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of the Libel.</NOTE>
that greater accuracy would now be expected than was
observed in former times<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of Gordon of Braco, (in February 1672), the libel only stated, That John Murison, messenger, had gone to execute a caption on the 16th Janu∣ary 1671, against the said Harry Gordon, for duties due to him by the pursuer, for his lands, as part of the Abbacy of Kinloss; without mention of the decree, or other grounds on which it issued, or of the lands for which these duties were paid.</NOTE>, in setting forth the substance of
the transgression. The diligence which has been hindered,
being (so to speak) the party offended, ought to be specified
by its date, and other distinctive characters; as also, unless a
good reason can be given for the want of it, (as if it perished
or was lost in the scuffle), it ought to be lodged in process,
for the pannel to examine. The time and place, likewise, of
the attempt to execute the diligence, may be grounds of ex∣ception
to the charge, and are therefore material to be set
forth. Hence, the libel was found irrelevant in the case of
James Farquharson<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“In respect, there was no day condescended on, whereon the said deforce∣ment was committed, deserts the diet as to him.”</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 4. 1673.</NOTE> where the time was left quite at large.</P>
<P>ON the other hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Component Wit∣nesses in the Trial</NOTE> with respect to the competent proof
of the crime; the prosecutor has freer scope allowed him
now, than would have been consistent with the notions
on which the ancient practice, respecting the admission of
witnesses, was formed. Instead of those restrictions and
distinctions of which Mackenzie has made mention, with
regard to the use of the messenger and his concurrents<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Tit. Deforcement, No. 5.</NOTE>, as
witnesses upon the Lord Advocate's prosecution, and which
in his time seem really to have been observed; those persons
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
are freely admitted, in like manner as other parties injured;
and are allowed to give evidence alike to the violence suffer∣ed
by themselves, and to the other circumstances of the story.
The party, employer of the messenger, cannot however be
a witness even in the Lord Advocate's action, unless he will
discharge his interest in the escheat, and for recovery of his
debt. And, if either he or the messenger prosecute, there
seems to be no sufficient reason, (though the contrary was
found in the case of <HI>Sword</HI> against <HI>French</HI>),<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 13. 1669.</NOTE> why any near re∣lation
of either of them, even though he be a subscribing wit∣ness
to the execution of deforcement, should be allowed to
give evidence in the trial. For in this article the condi∣tion
of deforcement is different from that of most other
crimes, that it cannot be committed on the officer, but in pre∣sence
of witnesses, and of witnesses chosen by himself; and
whom if he has not chosen properly, (knowing the risk of such
interferences), the blame is entirely his own.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF BREAKING PRISON.</HEAD>
<P>THE offence of breaking prison, equally as that of de∣forcement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREAKING PRISON.</NOTE>
seems properly to belong to that order of
crimes which are the subjects of our present inquiry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons of Pu∣nishment.</NOTE> be∣cause
the guilt of it lies chiefly in this, that it is an insult to
the law and civil government of the country. Those necessary
places of confinement are part of the public property, and
of the establishment for the conservation of peace and ad∣ministration
of justice; and are to be viewed somewhat in
the same light as the inferior officers and ministers of the
law, whose service is essential to the Judges and Magistrates
of the land, towards the maintaining of their authority, and
the effectual performance of their functions. Like them,
therefore, they have some portion of that awe and sanctity im∣parted
to them, which resides in all the members of the judi∣cial
department; so that their fabric must be protected from
all violent and rebellious attacks, either of enemies from with∣out,
or of the prisoners themselves. Nor is it the injury
and insult to the building that is alone to be considered on
such occasions, but also, and more especially, the breaking of
the state itself of public and lawful custody; out of which
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
when any one takes himself by his own authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV.</NOTE> he is guil∣ty
of a contempt of the Magistrate on whose warrant he is
confined, and interferes with the course of justice, and of
the law of the land, which has made this arrangement for
the keeping of him, and sees good cause for ordering things
to be conducted in that manner.</P>
<P>1. SUCH being the general notion of this offence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be commit∣ted by any Pri∣soner.</NOTE> it is
held to be committed, whatsoever be the quality of the pri∣soner
as to the cause of his commitment; whether it be that
he is a prisoner for debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1673</NOTE> (as in the case of Irvine of Hilton),
who is under a proper obligation to pay, and not to frustrate
his creditor's deligence, or that he is confined on a crimi∣nal
or even a capital charge; a condition which might seem
to warrant the accused to escape, and redeem his blood, if in
any way he can. The Judge may indeed regret the necessi∣ty
of punishing in such a case; yet still he cannot make al∣lowance
for the temptation, as a plea to exculpate from the
charge. For whether the man be innocent or guilty, it is
his duty as a subject to await the determination of the law
with respect to him; and he must be deemed in some mea∣sure
culpable and mutinous in doing otherwise. The libel
was accordingly found relevant in the case of John Pringle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> and of James Inglis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1720.</NOTE> both of them prisoners upon charge of
capital offences.</P>
<P>2. THOUGH the punishment will not always be the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And by any manner of Escape.</NOTE> the
crime is however held to be independent also of the manner
of the escape; whether it be by effraction of the building,
or by violence used to the keeper, or by artful devices (such
as the use of false keys or picklocks), or by corrupting the
gaoler, (which is an aggravation of the offence), or even by
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
advantage taken of his negligence, or of any other opportu∣nity,
though not of the prisoner's own contrivance, simply
to leave the gaol and escape<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Perezius,</HI> whom Mackenzie appeals to, as saying, that a criminal may law∣fully escape if he use no violence, hath not said so, but this only, that his escape does not infer his guilt of the crime for which he was in gaol.</NOTE>. In the case of Alexander
Macgrigor, it was found relevant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. and Aug. 4. 1720.</NOTE> “his coming out of prison,
by violence or by stealth, time and place libelled;” and on
verdict, finding “that the pannel escaped out of the tolbooth
of Edinburgh, but used no violence in his escape,” he was
sentenced to imprisonment for five weeks. Nay, which
is still stronger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. &amp; 25. 1739.</NOTE> in the case of James Ratcliff <HI>alias</HI> Wal∣ker,
whom the libel only charged with “making his escape
out of the tolbooth of Edinburgh, without lawful dis∣charge
or liberation,” and with respect to whom the alle∣gation
was made, and was tacitly admitted in the debate,
that he had left the gaol when thrown open by the Porteous
mob; the Court nevertheless found “the libel, and several ar∣ticles
thereof, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pains of law;
and repelled the haill defences proponed for the pannel.”
This Ratcliff was a prisoner for capital crimes.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Mackenzie, who was himself counsel for
the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3. 1673.</NOTE> the like decision was given in the case of Irvine
of Hilton, a prisoner for debt. And certainly it would re∣quire
some strong reason to exempt such a one from a measure
of duty and obedience, which is thus exacted of the person
who stands in hazard of his life and person. But it does
not appear from the record, that this question either was or
could be determined in the case of Irvine; where the libel
charged the violent effraction of a vault in the building, or
art and part thereof, by the pannel and five persons more, who
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
were all missing on the same morning, and seem to have made
good their escape by means of a rope let down from a win∣dow.
This, therefore, was the subject of debate on that oc∣casion;
whether, from the pannel's escape in the same night,
and by the same expedient as the other prisoners, he should be
presumed to have been art and part of the effraction of the
vault; and if it lay with him to prove, in the way of defence,
that the others were the active persons in the breaking, and
that he only <HI>ex past facto</HI> availed himself of the opportunity
which they had given him, to regain his freedom. The in∣terlocutor
simply sustains the charge of effraction, and art
and part<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“<HI>Triply for the Advocate,</HI> The act of Parliament has declared, that criminal libels in the general terms of art and part, are relevant; and besides, public pri∣sons being broken, and the pannel escaping at the same time, in law, it imports an accession to the crime libelled, unless the pannel would condescend and of∣fer to prove, by way of exculpation and defence, that the effraction and vio∣lence was committed by others, and that, <HI>ex post facto,</HI> he thereafter esca∣ped.”</P>
<P>“The Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, finds the libel, reply and triply, as they are declared, <HI>ad poenam arbitrariam,</HI> relevant, and admits the same to the knowledge of an assize.”</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach of unlaw∣ful Imprison∣ment.</NOTE> to place the pannel in the possibility of committing
this offence, he must have been in a state of lawful custody;
meaning by this, that he have been detained upon a warrant
truly directed against him, and proceeding from a just autho∣rity.
For upon any charge of breaking prison, the first step
on the prosecutor's part must be, to prove that the pannel was
<HI>a prisoner;</HI> one whom the keeper of that gaol had a mandate,
<HI>ex facie</HI> regular, to confine. Now, if either the pannel has
been laid hold of instead of another person; or if he is not of
the name mentioned in the warrant; or if there be no written
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
warrant, in a case where the ordinary course of law requires
one; or if the warrant proceed from one who is no Magistrate
for those bounds; in any of these cases the man is not proper∣ly
a prisoner in the sense of law as to this question, and can∣not
therefore be charged with it as a crime, (at least, if he
use no cruelty nor excess in accomplishing his purpose), that
he relieves himself from this (as it must be accounted) un∣warrantable
state of confinement. This point seems virtually
to have received a judgment in the case of James Inglis alrea∣dy
quoted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1720.</NOTE> The libel charged three different acts of breaking
prison; of which one was an escape from the gaol of Edin∣burgh,
where he was prisoner upon the warrant of one of the
Lords of Justiciary, and the other two were escapes from the
gaol of Tranent, to which he had twice been committed by
a constable, who had him in custody on suspicion of horse∣stealing.
It was pleaded for him, that a constable could not
imprison. Accordingly, the interlocutor of relevancy sustains
the first charge, and takes no notice of either of the others<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the pannel being imprisoned within the tolbooth of Edinburgh, upon warrant of one of the Lords of Justiciary, did, the time libelled break the said prison, and make his escape, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if the warrant is apparently good; being directed
against the pannel, and proceeding from one who is competent
to give it, and not being marked with any plain vice upon the
face of it; these things will constitute the man a prisoner as
to this article of duty, and lay him under the necessity of
seeking his relief in course of law, on the ground of those
more remote and less palpable irregularities, if such there
be, which have been committed in the proceedings ante∣rior
to application for the warrant, or even in the imme∣diate
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
course of process for obtaining it. Thus, if war∣rant
<HI>meditatione fugae,</HI> has been granted on an irregular oath<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Are we to judge by the same rule, in the case of warrant of commitment for a crime, which does not proceed upon a signed information? It may be urg∣ed, that according to the act 1701, c. 6. the gaoler who detains on such warrant, is equally liable as the Magistrate who gives it, in the penalties of wrongous impri∣sonment. On the other hand, wherever the warrant is separate from the infor∣mation, (which often happens), the gaoler knows nothing of the defect; nor is he entitled to inquire at the Magistrate about it, nor to refuse obedience on any such supposition. For which reasons, it may perhaps be thought, that the gaoler paying the penalties, shall have relief against the Magistrate. The case of war∣rant of commitment which does express the crime, seems to be more unfavour∣able to the gaoler. For the fault here appears on the face of the warrant; and the gaoler, (who is obliged to know thus much of the law), may refuse to obey the warrant, or receive the person into custody.</NOTE>,
or if letters of horning issue on a decree of the Justices
of Peace; in either case, the debtor is a prisoner, and can∣not
break his state of custody, without being guilty of a
crime. In situations of this sort, where the person has
been reduced to a state of settled custody, the case is not
near so favourable as that of one who resists the first exe∣cution
of an irregular warrant to apprehend him; and for
whom it may be argued, that he only endeavours to main∣tain
himself in the possession of his state of freedom. It is
to be considered, too, concerning all vices of this descrip∣tion,
which are extrinsic to the face of the commitment,
that the goaler has no power to inquire into them, and can∣not
refuse to obey upon such pretences; so that he being
authorised and obliged to detain, there cannot also be an op∣posite
right in the prisoner to break that state of custody,
or to resist him. If the judicial means of relief in such si∣tuations
be subject to delays; the law in requiring these,
which is done for the sake of justice and due investigation,
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
has in effect commanded the prisoner to submit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BREAKING PRISON.</NOTE> in the mean
time, and trust to the obtaining full reparation in the end,
of all the wrong he may sustain.</P>
<P>IT is also to be remembered, respecting even the former
and more favourable case, of warrant which is intrinsically
vicious, that the prisoner shall not stand excused from pu∣nishment,
though in strictness he cannot be indicted for the
crime of breaking prison, if he conduct his escape with
outrage and cruelty to the gaoler, or by exciting a mutiny
and commotion among the other prisoners. Still less is it
to be imagined, that the law can in any case pardon or over∣look
a riotous entry or destruction of the building, by a
multitude from without; who in this rude fashion arrogate
to themselves the judgment and redress of the wrong, which
does not in anywise belong to them. This seems to have
been the ground of repelling the defences in the case of
John and George Sinclairs of Barrack and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 13. &amp; 20. 1699.</NOTE> who were
indicted for tumultuously breaking into the gaol of Thurso,
and freeing certain persons, there at the time, (and, as they
endeavoured to shew, unlawfully), confined<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords found the first member of the libel auent the pannels breaking open the <HI>public prison,</HI> and making the escape of prisoners, relevant, as it is li∣belled, to infer the pains of law; and repelled the defences proponed for the pannels against the same.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>4. THE fourth and last circumstance of this transgression is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is accounted a Prison.</NOTE>
that the place from which the prisoner escapes be a proper,
public, and established gaol; though whether it be a county∣gaol,
or that of a burgh or a barony, will be immaterial
to the charge. To escape from any other, the more tempo∣rary
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
and occasional places of custody, may also be a crime,
especially if it is accomplished by means of violence, or is
attended with tumult; but it cannot be libelled as the crime
of breaking prison. In the aforesaid case of Sinclairs, the
double objection was moved, that the prison was but a barony
prison, and that the prisoners had not been confined in the
proper <HI>tolbooth,</HI> but in another and private place of keeping.
The interlocutor requires the breaking of the <HI>public</HI> prison,
and repels the other defences.</P>
<P>5. THE pains of law for this offence are not determined by
any statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for this Crime.</NOTE> and will be accommodated to the circumstances
of the case; according to the manner of the escape (by vio∣lence,
or by stealth, or upon opportunity given); according to
the quality of the cause of confinement, (as it is civil or crimi∣nal,
capital or otherwise); and, in the case of assistance from
without, (for the assisters are art and part of the crime), ac∣cording
to the nature and degree of that assistance. It
should seem, that, in general, the assistant has less excuse than
the prisoner himself, for whom the love of life and freedom
pleadeth. But in this something will depend, not only on the
degree of the outrage that is offered to the public custody in
conducting the escape, but also on the nature of the relation
between the prisoner and the assistant, and the probable mo∣tive
of the aid that has been lent; though it is not to be
imagined, that even in the most favourable of those situations
the offence ceases to be an object of prosecution.</P>
<P>THE natural and ordinary course of punishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for this Crime.</NOTE> is by
a renewal of that confinement from which the pannel has
unlawfully freed himself. The sentence is, however, some∣times
carried farther. James Inglis was banished Scotland
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
for life; and John Pringle had sentence to be scourged.
And indeed it is not to be doubted, that even these pe∣nalties
are not sufficient, if the enlargement of prisoners is
accompanied with great injury to the person of the gaoler,
or to the strength of the fabric; and still less, if it is ac∣complished
by the riotous assault of an outrageous mul∣titude,
which might itself be libelled as the separate of∣fence
of mobbing, and of course is a high aggravation,
and may be so charged, of the crime of breaking pri∣son.
In the case of Charles Weir and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22. 1700.</NOTE> it was
found, that to have a hand in the violent effraction of the
building by a mob within burgh, or to be present and assist∣ing
at the effraction as a guard in arms, was such an act of
riot as inferred the pain of death. We shall see that later
practice seems to have departed from that opinion; but it
is certain, that the capital crime of fire-raising is equally
committed by burning a gaol or any part thereof, as by
burning any private and ordinary habitation.</P>

<P>I. WE may properly refer to the same class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XV.</NOTE> of which we
are now treating, all offences committed against
Judges, in their person, dignity, or same: because the inju∣ries
which are offered them with relation to their duty,
not only lessen the respect and authority of their office,
but, if left unpunished, would tend to impose a restraint
on the proceedings of Judges, through the fear of such
consequences in the performance of their functions, and
would thus be prejudicial to the free and unbiassed course
of justice. Our Legislature, therefore, have justly been
anxious to guard their safety in those respects by peculiar
provisions, beyond that of other men.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206"/>
1. As to their person. To kill any of the Lords of Session
or Justiciary, sitting in judgment, is treason, by the act of the
7th Anne, c. 21.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Killing or Inva∣ding of Judges.</NOTE> To invade or pursue any of “his High∣ness's
Session<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It seems to be doubtful, whether this phrase relates to the Lords of Session or of Privy Council.</NOTE>,” if it be on account of service done the King
in that capacity, (as for instance in revenge of proceedings
with respect to traitors), is, by the act 1600, c. 4. a capital
offence. As it also is, in terms of statute 1593, c. 177. to strike
or hurt any Judge, when sitting in judgment. Nay, by the same
law, so strictly is the presence of Courts of Justice to be
guarded from all rude interruption, or approach of violence,
that it is even death to strike or hurt any person in the
Outer-house (or tolbuith, as it is called in the act) during
the sittings of the Lords of Session; or in presence of the
Justice or his deputes, (and now the Lords of Justiciary),
when sitting in judgment. Not to mention that in terms of
the same statute, (but now altered by the reception of the
English treason-law), it was made treason to strike any per∣son
in the presence of the Lords of Session sitting in judg∣ment,
“within the inner tolbuith.” The penalty of stri∣king
in presence of any inferior court, is fixed in the same
law at a fine of L. 100 Scots, and imprisonment during the
Judge's will.</P>
<P>EVEN such inferior acts of insult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insulting of Judges.</NOTE> disorder, or contempt
of Judges, as do not fall under the sanction of any of these
ordinances, are not however, on that account, held to be
below the cognisance of a criminal court, at common law.
The bare appearance or preparation of violence, as by clench∣ing
the fist, or shaking a stick; the use of contumelious,
reproachful, or threatening words; the challenging to fight;
or the insinuating of mischief and revenge; any of these
indecencies when used to a Judge or Magistrate, though out
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
of court, if on account of his judicial proceedings, and still
more if used in face of judgment, is a plain violation of
the due reverence of his character, and a most pernicious
attempt to infringe the freedom and impartiality of the
Court. A charge of this sort was accordingly sustained
at instance of Murray of Cringlety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 7. 14. 15. 1724.</NOTE> Sheriff-depute of Peebles,
and Bailie of the regality of Linton, against Thomas Sin∣clair
in Stobo; as he who had come up to the pursuer, when
attending as Bailie at the fair of Linton, and had there sha∣ken
a stick over his head, and indulged in other threatening
gestures, as well as in loading him with reproaches and foul
names, but without striking any blow; and this on account
of a judgment which Murray had given against him. The
Lords found the libel relevant<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find, that the pannel having, at the time and place libelled, in∣sulted or threatened the complainer in manner libelled, relevant to infer an ar∣bitrary punishment; but for alleviating the same, allows him, the pannel, to prove that the injurious words, threatening and insults libelled, followed imme∣diately upon the complainer's accusing him, the pannel, of telling lying stories; and repels the haill other defences,” &amp;c.</NOTE>; but the pannel was not con∣victed.</P>
<P>2. NEXT;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defaming of Judges.</NOTE> as to their character and fame. In which
point, it is still more important to the public, to guard and
protect the Judges of our Courts, than even in their personal
safety; considering how open the ears of the multitude to
this sort of scandalous information; and when once set on
foot, how readily it is circulated to a distance; and how ex∣tensive
and pernicious the evils, which ensue upon the awak∣ened
jealousy of the people, with respect to the integrity of
the persons who dispense the law to them, and have the de∣cision
of their most important interests in their hands. At∣tending
to these considerations, our Legislature, in one of
<PB N="207" REF="208"/>
the same statutes which punish the partiality or corruption
of a Judge, (the act; 1540, c. 104.), has on the other hand
protected the upright Magistrate, against those who slander
or accuse him; declaring, that if the offender “proovis not
the samin sufficientlie, he sall be punished in semblable
maner and sorte, as the saide Judge or person quhom he
<HI>murmuris,</HI> and sall pay ane paine-arbitral at the will of
the King's grace, or his Councel, for the infaming of sic
persones.”</P>
<P>OFFENCES of this sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is punishable summarily in some cases.</NOTE> if relative to any proceeding which
is at the time, or has lately been depending in the Criminal
Court, are punishable to a certain extent, as contempts, up∣on
summary conviction there, without the verdict of a jury;
the right arising in such cases, from the near contingency
of the slander and the proceedings; and still more from this
consideration, that the offence is committed against the
Court themselves, whose character and honour, if they are
meant to discharge their functions to any advantage, must
not for any the shortest period be sullied or suspected.</P>
<P>THIS was the course of proceeding against certain printers,
who, after the conviction of Nairne and Ogilvy, had publish∣ed
an opinion of English counsel on the case, accompanied
with notes, highly injurious to the Court and jury. The
Lords, on this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25. 1765.</NOTE> found, “That the publication of
the said opinion, especially with the notes prefixed to it,
was a high indignity to this Court, and a precedent dan∣gerous
to the constitution of this country; but in respect
of the special circumstances of this case, and more parti∣cularly
that the said printers have acknowledged their
fault, and submitted themselves to the Court; the said
Lords, in the present case, do not proceed to inflict any
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
punishment by fine, imprisonment or otherwise, but dis∣miss
them with a rebuke, which they appoint to be given
them by the Lord Justice-Clerk, and which they hope
will prevent the like from being done in future.” For the
like offence, of maligning the proceedings of Court, and at∣tempting
to vilify their persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 23. 1793.</NOTE> Johnston and Drummond
had sentence of imprisonment for three months, and to find
surety for their good behaviour in time to come<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the said publication is a false and slanderous representation of the proceedings in the said trial, and a gross indignity ossered to this Court, calculated to create jealousies and doubts of the due administration of justice by the Supreme Criminal Court of this part of the united kingdom.”</NOTE>. At a more
distant period, the Court had not even scrupled to adjudge
the offenders in this way to such a correction as would now be
thought competent only to be inflicted under the warrant of
conviction by an assize. For I find, that on the 24th of Fe∣bruary
1673, Donald Campbell, for reflections injurious to
the Earl of Athole, Justice-General, had sentence to stand
two hours upon the cuck-stool, and to crave pardon, and
have his tongue bored<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“They sand the said crime sufficiently proven, and therefore ordained the said Donald Campbell to be taken upon the twentie-fourth instant to the cock∣stool of Edinburgh, and there to stand betwixt two and four hours in the after noon, with a paper on his brest, bearing his fault, and making publick con∣fession thereof, and to have his tongue bored by the hand of the hangman; and thereafter to be carried to prison, therein to remain during the said Lords their pleasure.”</NOTE>. This man, during the trial of
Shaw, Spalding and others, for murder, and when standing
among the multitude by the Courr-house, had, to several
persons, accused the Earl of gross partiality, and corruption,
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
and especially of a resolution to acquit Shaw, and fix the
murder upon Spalding.</P>
<P>II. As the law has been thus liberal of its protection to
Magistrates and Judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of offences by Judges against their office.</NOTE> in their person, fame, and dignity;
so it holds them to be strictly answerable for the pure and di∣ligent
discharge of their important trust, and appoints them
to be punished with grievous and degrading pains, if by any
sort of corruption, or partiality, or even by neglect, they shall
suffer the channels of justice to be polluted or obstructed.
And this with the highest reason; since by such malversation,
beside perverting the salutary institutions of government, and
disappointing the wisdom and benignity of the laws of their
country, they even shake the reverence of the people for the
law itself and the office of Judge, and lessen their attach∣ment
to the established constitution of the land.</P>
<P>I. THE meanest and most infamous of this class of offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery in a Judge.</NOTE>
is that of bribery in a Judge; which is committed by the
selling of his judgment for good deed or reward to himself:
meaning by this, not only his taking a bribe to decide against
his conscience, but in general his taking to show favour in
his office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. 4. tic. 11. Lib. 48. Dig.</NOTE> <HI>“Quo magis aut minus quid ex officio suo faceret.”</HI>
This, in any of the Judges of the Court of Session, is pu∣nished
by the statute 1579, c. 93. with infamy, loss of office,
and confiscation of moveables, beside arbitrary punishment
in the person. And as to other Judges,—on comparison of
these statutes; 1424, c. 45.; 1427, c. 107.; 1449, c. 17.
1457, c. 76.; 1469, c. 26.; 1540, c. 104. which either par∣ticularly
mention bribery, or relate in general to the pu∣nishment
of partial and faulty Judges; and which appear
to have passed, like those on many other subjects, with∣out
<PB N="210" REF="211"/>
out much regard to their consistency with each other; the
result upon the whole seems to be, that bribery is subject to a
discretionary censure, including, among other penalties, the
like loss of fame and office, beside payment of the party's
costs, and reparation of his damage<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, in his Observations (p. 37.) on the statute 1449, c. 17. has said, “And the punishment of Judges offending in their offices, is now arbitrary, sui∣table to the nature of the offence.”</NOTE>. To what degree of
severity the sentence may be carried, can hardly be eluci∣dated
from the state of practice; for there seems to be
but one trial of a Judge for bribery, upon record. On the 1st
August 1687, William Fife, Bailie of the regality of Paisley,
was convicted of wrongous imprisonment, and of taking
a bribe on two occasions. But for some reason, of which
the record does not enable me to judge, the sentence was
not in terms even of the mildest of these statutes; but for
imprisonment only during the pleasure of the Court, and
for payment of L. 40 Scots, as damage to the party im∣prisoned.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bribery in the Officers of Court.</NOTE> though none of these laws make mention of the
inferior officers of Court, such as clerks, fiscals, macers,
and the like; yet it is not to be doubted, that for any of
these persons to take reward for shewing favour in his de∣partment,
is cognisable at common law, as a species of false∣hood
and breach of trust; for which he may be chastised
with as high penalties, as any that the statutes have appoint∣ed.
And upon such a charge, at least if it be relative to
any recent occurrence, the Judges of the Court where the
wrong happens, are probably competent to determine <HI>de pla∣no,</HI>
without an assize, and upon a summary complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212"/>
WITH respect, also, to the giving, or even the offering of
a bribe to any one, whether Judge or officer of Court, whose
station gives him a concern in the administration of justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giving or of∣fering a Bribe is punishable.</NOTE>
(upon which matter the statutes are equally silent), the same
observation will apply. For, if even the bribing of a vote to∣wards
election to serve in Parliament be a crime at common
law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 79. Aug. 19. Nov. 7. and Dec. 4 &amp; 5. 1786.</NOTE> (as was settled by the judgment in the case of Mackin∣tosh
and Dempster); and if the same be true, (as determined
in the case of James Stein), of the attempt to bribe an officer
of the revenue; much more must we be of the same opinion
concerning the still more wicked and audacious enterprise of
corrupting the very sources of public justice; which must
not only be pure, but exempt even from the suspicion of ac∣cessibility
to any manner of influence, and chiefly to this,
the basest, most dangerous, and most degrading influence of
any. And here I shall take occasion to say, in general, up∣on
this head of bribery, that as the turpitude is undeniable of
seducing any servant of the public to betray his trust, what∣soever
be the object of it; so there will be no doubt of the
competency, at common law, of inflicting an exemplary pu∣nishment
on account of any, either successful or unsuc∣cessful,
if serious endeavour, which is made towards so foul
a purpose.</P>
<P>2. IT is not only the corruption of a Judge that falls un∣der
the sanction of the statutes above mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppression or Partiality of Judge.</NOTE> but also
his partiality, or his refusal of justice; and, in general, his
iniquitous and oppressive conduct, if gross and wilful, and
made evident in a course of ouvert and convincing facts.
As if he shall openly consult with and assist all such persons
who are in controversy before him with a certain individual,
and shall instigate others to molest him in the like sort. Or if
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
he shall repeatedly imprison the same person, on frivolous
pretences; or shall harrass him with frequent and groundless
charges, which are brought at instance of the Judge's fiscal by
his orders, and are unlawfully or intemperately conducted.
The same will hold, though his proceedings are not direc∣ted
by enmity to any individual; if they amount to gross
malversation, and are the plain result of a violent and arbi∣trary
or greedy disposition in the Judge, which leads
him to stretch the powers of his office beyond their
known lawful bounds, or capriciously to exert those powers,
either for the gratification of his humour, or the increase
either of his consequence or his emoluments. This is exem∣plified,
as to the matter of imprisonment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 1. 1687.</NOTE> in the aforesaid case
of Fife; where frequent and causeless acts of imprisonment
were found relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“As to the first article of the lybel, anent the imprisonement of Jannet Corss twice, they sustain each of the said imprisonements relevant; and lyk∣ways finds, that part of the defence, viz. that she gave the Bailie the opprobri∣ous words mentioned in the defence at two severall tymes befor the respective imprisonments, relevant to eleid the same.”</P>
<P>“As also, finds the three articles of imprisonement against Hugh Snodgrass relevant, <HI>separatim;</HI> and sustanes the defence proponed at the first imprisone∣ment, viz. that the clerk refused to read the lybell when the Baillie command∣ed him, relevant to eleid the same; and finds, that the imprisonment are pro∣bable be witnesses.”</P>
<P>“As to the severall articles in takeing money in brybes in the causs, when he satt as Judge, the Lords finds the same relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI>—as to the last article anent the pannell's exacting money from the persons lybelled at the dis∣trict in October 1683, finds the samen as it is lybelled relevant.”</P></NOTE>. In
the later case of David Kennedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 9. &amp; 23. 1722.</NOTE> Bailie-depute of Carrick,
and Thomas Nimmo his fiscal; the pannels, among other
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
grounds of complaint, were charged with the raising of re∣peated
prosecutions against certain persons, upon frivolous
and false grounds, and of which no fewer than six were never
brought to any issue. They were also charged with the repeat∣ed
holding of unlawful proceedings, called <HI>Wood-courts,</HI> in the
different parishes of the bailiary; wherein, upon edictal citation
of all the inhabitants of a parish, and upon a general charge
of infringing the statutes against cutting of green-wood, and
killing of red fish in forbidden time, they were obliged to
swear to their innocence, or were held as confessed and de∣creed
in the penalties, (notwithstanding an act of indemnity),
or, if they failed to attend, were fined as contumacious. The
Court found the libel relevant, as laid for the pains of op∣pression
and malversation in office<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 23. “The Lords find the said David Kennedy of Kirk-Michael, pan∣nel, his holding of courts upon alleged transgressions of penal statutes, in the general, and proceeding in the said courts in manner libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and also find, that James Macwhirter and Anaple Maccullie, pursuers, they having been so frequently cited within the space of, and times libelled, at the instance of Thomas Nimmo the procurator-fiscal; and upon the said citations, the said David Kennedy, bailie, the other pannel, not having brought the several libels, whereupon the saids pursuers were cited, to a final issue and conclusion, relevant to infer against the saids pannels the foresaid pains; and repelled the haill defences proponed for the pannels.”</NOTE>; but the pannels had a
verdict in their favour<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Libel for oppression was raised, (November 22. 1714), against the Sheriff-depute, Sheriff-clerk, and fiscal, of the shire of Caithness, on the ground of irre∣gular poindings for fines, the refusal of extracts, the charge of unlawful dues, and the like; but for sundry reasons, the whole charges were found irrelevant. The same was the issue of the charge against Moodie of Melsetter, and others, Jus∣tices of Peace for Orkney, (August 1. 1712), charged with partial and oppres∣sive proceedings upon complaints raised up by themselves, against certain clergy∣mes, men, the pursuers of this process. The Court found, “that there is no such <HI>gross malver sation</HI> libelled, as is sufficient to infer a punishment against the said Justices.”</NOTE>. In the Circuit-Court, however, at
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
Ayr, on 2d May 1720, upon complaint at instance of the
Advocate-depute, against Ferguson of Auchinblane, Sheriff-depute
of Ayrshire, for the irregular execution of an unjust
and oppressive sentence, a suitable censure was, on his con∣fession,
summarily inflicted.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The proceedings are printed entire in the Appendix, No. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was with a view to the same salutary object,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malversation of Sheriffs; how to be tried. 1487, c. 103.</NOTE> and in
order to facilitate the correction of such abuses, that a sta∣tute
of James III. ordered the Justice, upon the last day of
every Circuit-Aire, “to give an assize to the Sheriff and
Coroner gif they have used and done their office <HI>truely.</HI>”
This trial of the deportment of those officers, seems to have
been intended to close the proceedings of the Justice-Aire,
whether any complaint were made of them or not; but Sir
George Mackenzie informs us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observ. on Stat. p. 92.</NOTE> that in his time no Sheriff
tholed an assize, unless upon a special charge of malversa∣tion.
Even now, however, this vestige of the ancient prac∣tice
remains, that the Sheriffs are called up at the close of
every Justice-Aire, and all persons are invited to appear,
who have cause of complaint against any of them. Though
whether, in case of a complaint being made and insisted in, the
Sheriff would still be liable to the peculiar and <HI>summary</HI> course
of trial, before an assize instantly impannelled upon the
charge, no precedent of modern date informs me. It was
once pretended; but after full debate a judgment was given
against it; that in consequence of the desuetude of the an∣cient
<PB N="215" REF="216"/>
form of impannelling an assize upon the Sheriff's
conduct at large, he became liable to summary trial before
the Court themselves, without an assize, on petition and com∣plaint
of the party wronged. This was in the case of John
Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. 1736.</NOTE> Sheriff-depute of Wigton; against whom an indivi∣dual
had offered a complaint to the Lord Royston, in the Cir∣cuit-Court
at Ayr, in May 1736, charging him with an un∣due
refusal to make presentment of a certain crime, in order
to trial on that circuit<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Find, “That the said John Gray was not obliged to answer summarily to the foresaid complaint, and therefore dismiss the same; without prejudice to the petitioner to prosecute the said complaint before the next Circuit-Court at Ayr, or before the Court of Justiciary, as accords.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it may not be amiss to close this ar∣ticle
of our inquiry, with the admonition that is given to
Judges, in a statute of that wise and good Prince, our James I.;
and which even now, when the expressions have become
vulgar or obsolete, retains, however, a degree of elegance,
owing to the humane and charitable spirit in which it is
drawn: “And gif there bee onie pure creature, for faulte
of cunning, or dispenses, that cannot, nor may not follow
his cause, the King, for the love of GOD, sall ordaine the
Judge, before qwhom the cause suld be determined, to
purvey and get a leill and a wise Advocate, to follow sik
pure creatures cause: And gif sik causes be obteined, the
wranger sall assyith baith the partie skaithed, and the Ad∣vocatis
coastes and travel: And gif the Judge refusis to
do the law <HI>eavenlie,</HI> as is before said, the partie complei∣nand,
sall have recourse to the King, qwha sall see rigo∣rouslie
punished sik Judges, that it sall be exemple till all
uthers.”</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217"/>
3. As already hinted; it is even a point of dittay, if a
Judge or Magistrate shall either leave unperformed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neglect of Duty in Judges.</NOTE> or shall
perform in a slack and insufficient manner, any known and
capital point of his duty: which is more especially true of
what relates to the detection or punishment of criminal offen∣ders,
or to the preserving of the peace of his district, or the
due authority of his office. For this he is as much bound to
maintain entire, as he is to be content with that measure of
power and pre-eminence which by law belongs to his station.
This responsibility has been exemplified in various instan∣ces.
In 1681, the Magistrates of Lanark were fined, for ne∣glecting
to oppose, or to prosecute, the persons who had
raised a tumult in that burgh, on occasion of the passing
of the test-act, and had publicly burned the statute. On the
5th July 1751, it was found relevant against Robert Bell
and Christopher Bannatyne, Magistrates of the same place,
“That when they, or either of them, were Bailies of the
burgh of Lanark, they or either of them wilfully neglec∣ted
to pursue such measures as were necessary and proper
for preventing and quelling the said mobs, or punishing
those who were guilty or accessory to the committing the
said disorders and violences, as libelled.” These were
tumults on occasion of the settlement of a minister. Judgment
was given to the same effect, in the case of Alexander Ander∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 16. 1713.</NOTE>
one of the Bailies of Bruntisland; where it was found re∣levant,
“his coming along with the mob, that opposed the
said Mr Russell, (a minister), as aforesaid, and being pre∣sent
there without endeavouring to quiet the tumult; but
likewise, on the contrary, giving rude language to the said
Mr Russell, or laughing at the actings of the said mob, or
aproving the same.”</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="218"/>
LIKEWISE, on the 1st May 1728, on the Circuit-Ayre at
Dumfries, Alexander M'Ghie, Steward-substitute of Kirk∣cudbright,
having failed to execute the Porteous-roll in terms
of law, whereby all the intended trials were hindered;
he was, upon complaint of the Advocate-depute, deprived
of his office, and declared incapable of bearing it in time
to come<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The proceedings are printed entire in the appendix, No. 5.</NOTE>. And again; the following interlocutor was given
on the libel at instance of a private party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14. and Dec. 5. 1726.</NOTE> against Honyman
of Graemesay, Stewart and Justiciar-depute of Orkney, for
failing to use due diligence in searching for and pursuing
the offenders in a case of murder. “Find, That he the
said pannel, after the said deceased Captain James Moodie
had received the wound whereof he died, did assist the
other persons libelled against, to make their escape; or that
he the pannel, Stewart and Justiciary-depute of the place
where the said murder was committed, did refuse or ne∣glect
to use his authority for apprehending the said other
persons, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” The
pannel was also indicted as accessory to the murder. But
both charges seem to have been groundless; and the jury
found a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>FARTHER; it is not to be understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neglect of Duty in public Officers.</NOTE> that it is only with re∣spect
to Judges, or in the exercise of powers of a judicial
nature, that this of neglect of duty, is acknowledged as a
point of criminal accusation. Even if our statutes were silent
on the subject, the common law would reach his misdemean∣our,
who as a Magistrate, or in any station of public trust,
should be notoriously careless of the welfare of that which
is committed to him. But in truth we have a statute, 1457,
c. 76. “anent the punition of negligent officiars,” which
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
in this article declares and confirms the common law, (for it
can hardly be said to do more), and orders that the per∣sons
“who be found in faultise,” shall lose their offices, and
be liable to punishment in goods and person, “after the
quantitie of sik trespasse at the King is will.” It was
partly upon this act, and partly at common law, that the
charge was laid against Archibald Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 26. 27. 28. 29. and Nov. 2. 1747.</NOTE> Provost of Edin∣burgh,
for alleged misbehaviour and neglect of duty, with
respect to the requisite arrangements for the defence of the
City of Edinburgh, against the rebels, in 1745. The libel was
found relevant to infer the pains of law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find it relevant to infer the pains of law, that the pannel, at the time and place libelled, being then Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh, wilfully neglected to pursue, or wilfully opposed and obstructed when proposed by others, such measures as were proper or necessary for the defence of the city against the rebels, in the instances libelled, or so much of them as do amount to such wilful neglect; and find it relevant as aforesaid, <HI>separatim,</HI> that the firelocks and bayonets belonging to the city, or the cannon mounted on the city walls, fell into the hands of the rebels, through the wilful neglect of the said pannel, or that he refused or neglected to take proper measures, when re∣quired or demanded, which were in his power, for securing, or rendering use∣less to the rebels, the said arms; and find relevant as aforesaid, all such acts charged upon the pannel by the libel, which shall appear to have been unneces∣sarily done, and which did manifestly tend to the preventing or weakening the defence of the town, or the facilitating the rebels getting possession there∣of, or their seizing the arms therein.”</NOTE>; but the pannel
had a full acquittal of all the points of the charge.</P>
<P>III. The crime of THEFTBUTE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theftbute, what it is.</NOTE> which also belongs to the
class of offences against public justice, is so named from
the Saxon word <HI>Bute,</HI> signifying amends. It is committed
by compounding with a thief, to save him from prosecution.
That a person whose goods have been stolen, simply takes
them again, and lets the thief go; though it is not a course
<PB N="219" REF="220"/>
of conduct which the law can approve, will not however come
within the notion of theftbute; which implies some sort of
corrupt compact with the thief, whereby the person who
has him in his power, barters the public justice for profit
and lucre to himself. This, however, may either be done,
by taking a ransom from the thief to dismiss him, (which
seems to have been called the <HI>selling of a thief</HI>), or by <HI>sining with
him,</HI> that is, receiving a share of what he has stolen, to pro∣tect
him. For in either case, the compounder shews his
utter disregard of the public interest, and not only encourages
the thief to persist in his thieving, but is himself parta∣ker
of a gain which arises out of it; and is thus invol∣ved
in a sort of guilt, somewhat allied to that of stealing,
or of resetting stolen goods. In this point of view the mat∣ter
had been considered, at the date of our only general statute
on the subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against it.</NOTE> 1515, c. 2.; which treats the taker of theftbute
as art and part of the theft, and orders him “to underly the
law and be accused therefor as principal thief and rie∣ver.”
A prior statute, 1436, c. 137. but which seems only
to relate to the case of Magistrates, (for the word <HI>uthers,</HI>
which occurs in the act, cannot well be carried farther than
to other <HI>Magistrates,</HI> beside those who are mentioned in the
statute), had ordained, that in the deeper and more shameful
case of <HI>their</HI> guilt, in whom the public trusts for the detection
of thieves, the punishment shall be loss of life and confisca∣tion
of goods. At least, these are the pains denounced
against Sheriffs and Justiciars; for the words of the act
are aukwardly enough disposed, to occasion some difficulty
of applying the same sanction, (though probably intended by
the Legislature), to the case of other Judges.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221"/>
BUT although theftbute be still a point of dittay, and
might probably have been so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If now punishable in terms of the Statutes.</NOTE> though the Legislature had
said nothing on the subject; yet it may be questioned whe∣ther
there is now sufficient authority to pass judgment for
the <HI>statutory pains,</HI> at least in the less aggravated case of
an ordinary culprit. And this, not only on account of the
altered situation of the country, which does not now re∣quire
the same sharp restraint as formerly, of this corrupt
and pernicious sort of compact; but because, even in the
times which stood more in need of such a remedy, the ri∣gour
of the law, or even any prosecution of the offenders,
does not appear to have been in use. In so much that up∣wards
of a century ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crim. Part I.</NOTE> as Mackenzie has informed us, it had
become a point of controversy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 20. No. 1.</NOTE> and was agitated in the case
of Angus Mackintosh, whether the statutes had not been lost
by long neglect<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Mackenzie's account of this decision is incorrect, 1<HI>st,</HI> In the date, which, as reported by Stair, is February 21. 1666. 2<HI>dly,</HI> In the substance of the decision, for the Lords of Session did not resolve to hear it themselves, but advocated and remitted to the Justices. 3<HI>dly,</HI> As far as appears, the debate was not about the competency of punishing the offence, but about the nature of the crime, and the competency of punishing <HI>in terms of the statutes.</HI></P>
<P>In his Observations on the statutes, p. 30. Mackenzie says, and probably with relation to this case, (though he neither mentions date nor names of parties). that theftbute was found a crime, <HI>yet punishable.</HI> I have not found any such decision in the Books of Adjournal; at any rate, these terms do not indicate a capital pain.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the giving of theftbute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Giving of Theftbute, if punishable.</NOTE>—I cannot find
that this had ever been held to be cognisable as a separate
offence. But if we may trust to the laws of William, and
of Robert I.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Stat. Wilh. c. 15.—Stat. Inea. R. I. c. 9.</NOTE>; such was the weight of this circumstance
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
as a presumption of the guilt of <HI>theft,</HI> that the giver was on
this single ground to be held as a thief convicted, and to be
disposed of accordingly. This might be agreeable to the
character of the jurisprudence of those times, and especi∣ally
to that article of the practice concerning theft, by
which a person was liable to death upon the mere <HI>bruit</HI> and
defamation of the neighbourhood. But such a circumstance
could not now be considered any otherwise, than as one
ground of suspicion along with others.</P>
<P>IV. THESE seem to be a summary of the chief offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilful Error upon Assize.</NOTE> of
which the law now takes cognisance as hostile to the course of
public justice. But as relative to the practice of former times,
there is one more to be added to the list, and among the
most important of any in its consequences, that of the <HI>temera∣rium
perjurium supper assizam,</HI> or rash and wilful error upon as∣size.
This transgression, according to the <HI>Regiam Majestatem,</HI>
b. 1. c. 14. which is referred to and confirmed by stat. 1475,
c. 63. was to be punished with the severe pains of infamy,
escheat of moveables, and imprisonment for year and day.</P>
<P>THAT it is equally a point of dittay for a juryman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of that Offence.</NOTE> as for
a Judge, to be corrupted by bribe or reward, and to return
a false verdict, contrary to the trust of his office, and the so∣lemn
oath which he has taken to do justice between the par∣ties;
this never could be doubted to be law. But that to which
I now allude, is quite a different, and a far more exception∣able
sort of charge; which was made without the warrant of
any favour received by the juror, or even of any solicita∣tion
or improper practice with respect to him, from which
corruption might reasonably be inferred; and on the single
ground of verdict of acquittal having been returned by the
assize, contrary to what, in the prosecutor's estimation, was
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
clear and sufficient evidence for condemnation; so that the
error being palpable and manifest, was therein to be held as
proved to be a corrupt and wilful error too.</P>
<P>THAT this was the proper notion of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds for convicting of it.</NOTE> and of the
competent grounds for convicting of it, in particular appears
from that clause of the act 1475, c. 63. which regulates the
trial of the jurors on such a charge, and appoints the pro∣secutor
to produce as proof against them, “the evidents or
notour knowledge of the trespasse, in sa far as was schawen
to the first assize;” meaning by this, <HI>the very proof of guilt</HI>
which was disregarded in the first trial, by the persons of
assize who are accused of wilful error. Accordingly, after
a full argument on this question, judgment was given to that
effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 25. 27. 1681.</NOTE> in the case of Alexander Blair and others
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The same point had been debated at large, and with much ingenuity and learning, between Sir Thomas Hope and Nisbet of Dirleton, (December 1635), upon the libel against Alexander Irving and others; but no decision was given; the diet being deserted by order of Council.</NOTE>, where
the depositions given upon the former trial were engrossed in
the libel; and where several of the pannels were convicted
on that one ground, and were condemned in the statutory
pains. Mackenzie too, in his observations on the foregoing
statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 81.</NOTE> approves of this decision, “because, (says he) the
error being <HI>clear,</HI> the error behoved necessarily to be <HI>wil∣ful,</HI>
and by partial means; nor was it possible to prove
these occult qualities, otherwise than <HI>ab effectu.</HI>”</P>
<P>THOUGH the text of the <HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI> make no di∣stinction
whether the false verdict acquit or condemn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was not com∣mitted by a wil∣ful conviction.</NOTE> and
though one expression towards the end of the statute 1475,
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
(“outher to be convict or made quit”), may seem to be fa∣vourable
to the same opinion; it is clear upon the principal
enactment and the sanction of that law, and still more upon
the course of practice, which does not afford a single in∣stance
of libel raised against an assize for a rash conviction,
that the only danger which had been thought necessary to
be guarded against in this manner, was that of favour in
absolving the pannel. It is true, that at inclosing the jury,
the pannel's counsel appear often to have protested for assize
of error, in case they should condemn, (as in the case of Fra∣zer,
30th July 1641, of Finnie, December 1664, and George
Graham, November 11. 1663); yet in those very cases, no
prosecution followed, though the pannel was found guilty.
Indeed, as the act 1475 declares, that the first verdict shall
stand good and have its course; this extraordinary conclusion
would have followed on the opposite opinion, as applied to
any capital case, that the jury were to be punished for con∣victing
the pannel, but the man was to be executed never∣theless.</P>
<P>IT seems also to have been the meaning of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor by the Votes of a lesser part of the Assize, to acquit. Obs. on Stat. p. 81.</NOTE> and it
was a settled point in practice, (though Mackenzie inclines to
think, that a different course would at least have been more
expedient, but he admits that the Court had never been
gained over to this opinion), that in case of a division in the
jury, there could be no process for error against those ju∣rors
who voted to acquit, unless, <HI>de facto,</HI> the pannel were
acquitted; because otherwise no prejudice ensued upon their
wrong.</P>
<P>THOUGH criminal trials were the most improper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False Verdict on retorable Brieves was punishable.</NOTE> they were
not, however, the only trials, upon which a jury were liable
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
to this sort of challenge; as appears from the statutes 1471,
c. 47. 1617, c. 13. which apply the same remedy to the case
of false verdict upon any of the retourable brieves. But
there was this material difference with respect to the issue of
the complaint in the two departments, that the acquitted cri∣minal
had the full benefit of the verdict in his favour, not∣withstanding
the attaint of the assize; whereas, by express
order of the statute 1471, relative to the verdict upon the ci∣vil
interest, this was to be set aside at the same time that the
assizers were to be punished for their fault. It may also
be mentioned, that the challenge of assizers making false re∣tour
of service, was, by act 1617, c. 13. limited to three
years from the date of the verdict; which seems to have been
a peculiar provision for that single case.</P>
<P>IN either province of right, the manner of trial was the
same, in terms of the act 1475; being either by verdict of a
great assize of 25 <HI>noble persons,</HI> (in practice construed to mean
<HI>landed men</HI>), or, (which was the course more commonly adopt∣ed,
as a means of mollifying the prosecutor), by confession
of party made before the Court; which sort of proceed∣ing,
in this case perhaps alone in the whole circuit of the
law, was thus made a competent ground of conviction and
sentence.</P>
<P>IN order to the preparing of the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Trial for this Crime.</NOTE> and the selecting
of the proper pannels, the act 1475 empowered the Privy
Council to call the assize before them, and require them se∣verally
to disclose their votes; and with the same view, the
regulations of judicial procedure made in 1672, enjoined the
Chancellor of assize, in making out the verdict, to distinguish
the vote of each assizer, by a note subjoined to his name. If
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
this was omitted, the guilt of the acquittal attached by pre∣sumption
to the whole assize, and it lay with any one who
had voted for condemning, to bring evidence of this fact
in his own vindication.</P>
<P>THE single instance of conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances of Trial for it.</NOTE> or indeed of trial be∣fore
a great assize, for this sort of perjury, is the case already
mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 25. 27. and Aug. 3. 1681.</NOTE> of Alexander Blair, James Baillie, and James
Gray, who were accused of acquitting certain persons, upon
their trial in absence, for treason. They had sentence of
escheat of moveables, infamy, forfeiture of the benefit of
the law, and to be imprisoned for year and day. In several
other instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 30. 1576. May 27. 1607. Dec. 1635.</NOTE> prosecution was commenced for wilful error;
but in some of them the diet was deserted, and in others
the pannels came in the King's will, and were fined.</P>
<P>IT is almost unnecessary to remark how inconsistent such
a challenge was with the principle of a trial by jury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">When abolished.</NOTE> or
to enlarge upon the evil consequences which might ensue
from the state of fear and constraint, in which jurors were
thus inclosed to determine on the lives and dearest inte∣rests
of their fellow-creatures. Assizes of error were, ac∣cordingly,
among the articles of grievance which were ex∣hibited
and declared by the Estates of Scotland in 1689;
and the abuse was from thenceforward at an end.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689, c. 18. art. 5.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF MOBBING.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER class of offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVI.</NOTE> little less interesting to the
community than those which we last considered, con∣sists
of such as tend to the disturbance of the public peace.</P>
<P>THE most eminent of these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extensive appli∣cation of the Term.</NOTE> and that which occupies the
largest portion of the books of adjournal, is the crime of
<HI>Mobbing,</HI> or, according to our older style, <HI>the Tumultuous Con∣vocation
of the Lieges.</HI> Under which general appellation our
practice seems to reduce the several degŕees and stages of
disorder, which are known in the law of England by the
names of <HI>Riot, Rout,</HI> and <HI>Unlawful Assembly.</HI> For whether the
convocation proceed to execute their violent purpose, which
is a <HI>riot</HI> according to the law of that country; or only take
some step towards execution of it, which is a <HI>rout;</HI> or are sim∣ply
met with the intention of doing mischief, which is an <HI>un∣lawful
assembly;</HI> this is a consideration which, in our practice,
seems to affect only the measure of the punishment, and
in nowise the style under which the offence falls to be char∣ged
in the indictment: provided always the meeting be at∣tended
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
tended with those circumstances of disorder and alarm,
which make it a punishable meeting.</P>
<P>I. THE crime being thus so various in kind and degree, I
shall not attempt to circumscribe the thing in any definition;
but shall rather allow the notion of it to be gathered from an
inquiry concerning the several particulars which are neces∣sary
towards the conviction of any offender in this kind.</P>
<P>1. THE most obvious circumstance is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must be the As∣sembly of a Number.</NOTE> that a great host or
multitude of people must be assembled. For herein it is,—in
the appearance of power, as well as disposition to execute their
unlawful purposes, of their own will and authority, that the
alarm and danger of such assemblies lies. But as to the lowest
number that will in any case suffice to make a mob; I have
found nothing in our records, which even tends to the esta∣blishment
of any constant rule. And truly this is a matter
of that sort, which is better left open to be decided upon the
circumstances of each case; according to the aspect and
purpose of the meeting, and the nature and degree of the
excesses to which they have proceeded. The higher these are,
the less the number that will be necessary to bring their of∣fence
within the notion of a mob; as, on the other side,
inferior outrages will sustain the charge, if they are the act
of a great host or multitude, whereof the very convocation
is itself a terror and subject of alarm.</P>
<P>2. THE assembly must be described as that which is to
the fear of the lieges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assembly must be to the sear of the Lieges.</NOTE> and the disturbance of the pub∣lic
peace; being accompanied with such circumstances
of actual violence, or of plain tendency thereto, as be∣get
a reasonable apprehension of what may ensue. It will
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
not, therefore, always affix the character of a mob to any
meeting, that it is a meetin for a wrong and an unlawful pur∣pose,
were it even such as is forbidden under pain of death;
if the business may be withal, and actually is transacted, in
a regular and quiet manner, without any circumstance of
open disorder or commotion. Thus the assembling to ce∣lebrate
mass, is, by certain statutes, a capital crime; and
the assembling to contrive the death of the King, is an ou∣vert
act of treason; for which the offenders may certainly
be arrested on the spot, and dealt with according to their
guilt: but still not as rioters; having convened, as for such
a purpose they naturally will, with all the precautions of se∣crecy
and retirement. If this be true of criminal conven∣tions
such as these; much more will the same hold good
of those meetings, though noisy and bustling, which are for
innocent or allowable purposes, such as foot-ball, racing,
cock-fighting, and the like; none of which pastimes are to
the disquiet nor uneasiness of the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>As a multitude may be convened for a criminal purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May be done by an Assembly for a lawful Act.</NOTE>
without being guilty of mobbing; so it is possible, on the
other side, that this crime may be committed in the execu∣tion
even of a lawful act, if the manner of it be irregular
and tumultuous. Thus, a Sheriff, a Justice of Peace, and
on some occasions a messenger, constable, or revenue-officer,
has right to command the assistance of the neighbourhood,
towards execution of the duty of his office. But it becomes
all these persons to confine the exercise of this delicate pri∣vilege
to the proper cases, and to proceed therein in a tempe∣rate
and orderly course.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disorderly exe∣cution of Dili∣gence.</NOTE> If, therefore, a messenger, being em∣ployed
to eject from lands or houses, shall take up a vain and
groundless fear of resistance; and if in this conceit, or under
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
the cloak of a pretended fear, he shall levy and carry along
with him a great host of armed and disorderly people, who,
without waiting to know their reception, tumultuously set to
work and drive off the cattle, break open the houses, and
alarm and insult the inhabitants; this seems to be alike pu∣nishable
under the name of Mobbing or Convocation, as if
there were no letters of ejection in the case; since they
are no warrant for proceeding in this rude fashion. If this
be true as to the messenger, it will be no less so as to those
who attend him on such an occasion; being bound to know
that such a rout, ready raised, cannot be the due order of
legal proceeding; so that if they remain with and accom∣pany
him, seeing the manner and temper of the assembly,
this is of their own choice, and not in virtue of any autho∣rity
he has over them<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Libel was raised on the 26th February 1722, bearing a charge to that effect against Monro of Culcairn, Sheriff-depute of Ross, George Robertson, Sheriff∣substitute, David Beaton, messenger, Colonel Munro of Fowlis, and other gentle∣men of that county, for a great convocation in arms by them as Sheriffs and assisstants, under pretence of executing a caption, against certain counsellors of the burgh of Dingwall, on the eve of an election there. The case was remitted for trial at the Circuit.</P>
<P>In November 1790, under pretence of executing an order of the Court of Ses∣sion, for pulling down a dam dike upon the river Leven, belonging to Sir James Colquhoun, a vast rout was levied, who proceeded to do their work with many circumstances of disorder, directed rather to the contumely of the individual, than to the interest of his adversary, or the honour of the Court. The Lords of Session took up this matter as incidental to a process which was depending before them, and inflicted a censure.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same judgment would meet the case of the revenue∣officer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disorderly search for run Goods.</NOTE> if instead of searching in a sober manner, and at
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
the proper places and seasons, he should parade with drum
and banner, and a multitude of followers, and predoniously
enter, insult and seize, wheresoever he chose to suspect.
The issue of such charges will, however, be always affected
by any reasonable fear of violence, which is shown on the part
of the pannel; as in the case of executing diligence against
a person who is known to be in the use of deforcing the offi∣cers
of the law, and who keeps a garrison of armed men in
his house, for his protection. And on this ground, probably,
went the interlocutor sustaining the defence in a case where
an allegation of this sort was made; the case of Keith, Gor∣don
and Innes, January 11. 1692<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Found the libel as to convocation to the number of forty or fifty persons, with the arms, libelled, relevant to infer the pains of the acts of Parliament; but sound that defence of the pannels Mr Robert Keith and James Gordon, that they were in the execution of a caption, also relevant to elide the libel <HI>sim∣pliciter, quead</HI> the <HI>convocation.</HI>”</NOTE>. In the now better disci∣plined
condition of the country, such a plea would, however,
be received with greater difficulty than it was in former
times.</P>
<P>3. THE convocation must not only have a tendency
towards violence and mischief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must be a com∣bination for Vio∣lence.</NOTE> but it must also consist of
persons, who are <HI>combined</HI> for some purpose of that kind.
It is the <HI>union</HI> and resolution of a multitude, who are in
league to defy authority, and to execute their pleasure by
means of force; by that means whereof the employment be∣longs
to the supreme power alone; that is the aggravat∣ing
quality of the crime of mobbing. And in this it is di∣stinguished
from a pure casual affray, or sudden quarrel break∣ing
out among persons, how numerous soever, who have
no such hostile views against the peace of the neighbourhood.
In vulgar speech, such a scene may sometimes be called
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
a riot; but in truth it is an offence of a far lower kind: For
a sudden broil of this fort, which may arise any how, shows
no rebellious temper nor determination of the assembly up∣on
mischief, from which the continuance or farther growth
of the disorder may be dreaded. I do not, however, mean to
say, that there cannot be a mob without a previous compact,
which was subsisting among the persons concerned, at the time
when they first assembled. There may be, and often is, a sub∣stantial
and sufficient, though sudden and tumultuary con∣sent
on such occasions, and among persons who at meeting
had no settled purpose of mischief. And wherever this fort
of tacit confederacy is evident in the behaviour and pro∣ceedings
of the body, the case is materially different from that
of a quarrel or occasional outrage, which is not conducted
upon any common principle of contempt, but is the peculiar
concern of those individuals who take an active part in it.
If this be true of the whole body, at the time when they
move upon their project; it is no less plain, with respect to
any individual who joins them after they are on foot, and
have declared their unlawful purpose, that he thus becomes
partaker of the guilt of their enterprise, and is punishable in
the same manner, as if he had been engaged in it from the
first.</P>
<P>4. TOUCHING the nature of the project in a case of mobbing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must be for an object of private Concern.</NOTE>
it is also to be observed, (and herein lies the main difference
between that crime and treason), that it is always a matter
of private concern. This is to be understood of private, as
in opposition to national concern, or the interests of State:
such as the reformation of the government; the lowering
of taxes; the throwing down of all inclosures; the repeal
or the passing of a public law; and other the like matters of
general and not of local or peculiar interest. Of which
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
last kind are such objects as these: to reduce the price of
grain in the market of a particular place; to rescue such
a criminal from execution; to hinder the division of the
town's common, or the like. Two tumults have happened in
Scotland, which may be thought to have been in this respect
of somewhat an ambiguous character: I mean the great mob
at Glasgow, in 1725, commonly called <HI>Shawfield's Mob,</HI> which
happened on occasion of the passing of the malt-tax; and
the still more considerable tumult in Edinburgh, commonly
called <HI>the Porteous Mob,</HI> which took upon itself the execution
of a person, who was indeed under sentence of death, but
had received a respite, which was supposed to be the fore∣runner
of a pardon. Yet I think; that in both instances, and
under the whole circumstances of the fact, the prosecution
was brought more properly for mobbing only; as will be
more fully shown under the head of treason. If the same
things had been done by an association of numbers from dif∣ferent
quarters of the country, and on a declared purpose
of travelling through Scotland to do the like, so as to
compel the repeal of the malt-tax act, or to hinder in every
instance the operation of the royal pardons; certainly such
a project, though the assembly were not attended with all
the apparatus of an army, would have been a levying of
war against the King, and an act of treason under the sta∣tute
of Edward.</P>
<P>5. WE have also to inquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the requisite degree of Vio∣lence.</NOTE> how far the assembly must
carry their disturbance of the public peace, to incur the
guilt of mobbing. Now, with respect to this; it is certain
that they become a mob by destroying, riffling, or in any
manner of way damaging, seizing, or invading, the property
either of individuals or the public. As also by any manner
of injury done to the persons of individuals; or by invasion,
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
seeking or pursuit of them, with intent to abuse, confine, or
put them in fear. Likewise, by violently constraining or in∣timidating
any one to act contrary to his interest, duty, or
inclination; as, for instance, to sell grain to the invaders at
their own price,—to refuse working at the ordinary rate of
labour,—to give orders for release of prisoners, or the like. It
would be tedious to rehearse the many judgments to this pur∣pose,
which appear in the record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>In the case of William Paton, David Black, and others, it is, <HI>inter alia,</HI> and <HI>separatim,</HI> found relevant to infer an arbitrary pain, “the said pannels or either of them, having, about the time libelled, in company with others, entered in a tumultuary manner into the house or houses, cellars or granaries, of any per∣son residing within the village of Ely or Kilconquher, <HI>making search therein</HI> for oats, pease or other victual, or were art and part thereof.” May 25. 1720.</P>
<P>On the 27th May 1720, in the case of Alexander and David Barry from Montrose, it is found relevant, “the saids pannels, or either of them, having the time libelled, threatened others of the town of Montrose, to meet with them at the times and places libelled, and that they did actually meet and convocate together, and did by threats oblige the Magistrates, Alexander Strachan, &amp;c. &amp;c. or any of them, to let them have meal at the price the said pannels de∣manded, or that the said pannels, or either of them, were art and part there∣of.”</P>
<P>And, of the same date, in the case of James Grant and others from Arbroath, tried on the same libel, it is sustained, “that in a tumultuous manner, they searched, or attempted to search, the houses or girnels of any of the inhabitants of Aberbrothock, for meal or other victual; or the said pannels, or either of them, their having the time libelled, threatened Thomas Wallace, or his wife, or others in his family, to open the said Thomas Wallace his girnels; or the said pannels, their having, the time libelled, by threats, compelled the said Thomas Wallace, to sell them a quantity of meal at the price the said pan∣nels, or the Deacon Convener set upon it; or that the said pannels, or either of them, were art and part of any of the facts above mentioned, all, <HI>separatim,</HI> re∣levant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P>
<P>Farther; on the 26th May 1720, in the trial of James Geddie, and others, in the town of Dysart, it is found relevant, among other acts, “that the said pan∣nels, did, at the time libelled, insult such as kept guard in the said town of Dysart, or threatened to force the guard, or burn the houses of the town; or that the said pannels, or either of them, were art and part of any of the facts above mentioned, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P>
<P>To mention one case more. The charge against Peter Macgrigor and George Lowrie, (August 3. 1784), was, That they had attacked a distillery with sticks and stones, in the view of forcing entry, but without success, and that they had staved some casks which lay without the wall of the building. The jury found, “That the said Peter Macgrigor was present in the mob at Canonmills, on the 4th June last, and particularly active in throwing stones at the distillery belong∣ing to James Haig and Company, and that the said George Lowrie was pre∣sent at said mob, and attempted to stave some casks, the property of Haig and Company; but find no other part of the libel proven against either of the said pannels.” Lowrie was imprisoned for six months, and Macgrigor was tran∣sported for fourteen years.</P>
<P>I have selected these passages, as instances of the <HI>lower</HI> acts of violence, which have been found relevant.

<P><PB N="234" REF="235"/>
IT is also certain, that although the assembly have not pro∣ceeded
to acts of force or outrage; yet if once, if any way,
they have plainly discovered their purpose of some violent
enterprise, and have made a movement, or taken any measure
towards immediate execution of it, this too, in the understand∣ing
of law, amounts to an act of mobbing. If, for instance,
a multitude assemble in the streets of a burgh, and take the
road in a body to a certain mill, with the declared purpose
of seizing the miller's grain; although, owing to panic,
or to intelligence that a force is provided against them,
they should disperse by the way, and without doing harm to
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
property or person; still they are guilty of a riot: because
of the great commotion and breach of the public peace;
as well as that their malice has taken a determinate course,
by which the individual is put in fear, and some advance
is made in the pursuit of the particular object. A sepa∣rate
charge of this character was sent to the assize along
with the others, in the case of John Fraser, of the 26th July
1784: it related to a meditated attack on the house of
the Sheriff of Edinburgh; for which purpose the mob went
thither, but retired without doing any damage, on finding
that a force was stationed there, to repel them.</P>
<P>As already intimated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is tumultuous assembling suffi∣cient without acts of Violence?</NOTE> our term of <HI>Mobbing</HI> or <HI>Convocation
of the Lieges,</HI> is of a broader construction even than this;
and such as reaches the bare act of being tumultuously assem∣bled
for a violent purpose, though no farther movement be
made toward execution of the unlawful project. If a great
host of people assemble upon the streets of a burgh by beat of
drum, and with something hoisted by way of standard, and
continue to parade there for a length of time, in contempt
of the peace-officers; providing themselves also with wea∣pons,
increasing their numbers, communicating by a watch∣word,
making declaration of some violent purpose, and with
loud clamours, and angry speeches and gestures, deterring all
interference with them; this, of itself, makes a mob, inde∣pendently
of the appearance of any Magistrate, to warn them
by reading the riot-act. For though no farther outrage
ensue, at least this great harm is done, that the peace of the
neighbourhood is broken; the individuals are alarmed who
know themselves to be the objects of these preparations; and
all the idle and licentious are put in motion, in the hope
of farther mischief. In the case, accordingly, of Peter
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
Macgrigor, August 3. 1784<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“That whereas, by the laws of this and every other well governed realm, the riotously or tumultuously assembling or convocating of a mob, or number of disorderly people, by beat of drum or otherwise, or the assisting, abetting, or being active in such riotous and tumultous mob, or the exciting, instigating, encouraging and somenting of such mob, to the disturbance of the public peace, and the invasion of private property.” See also the case of John Taylor, July 12. 1792.</NOTE> of Paul and Anderson, Au∣gust
23. 1784, and of John Fraser, July 26. 1784, the con∣vocating
of a tumultuous rabble, or disorderly mob, is made
an article of charge, distinct from the outrages afterwards
committed; and in each of these cases an indiscriminate re∣levancy
is found upon all the articles of the charge. In
the older case of the Darrachs and others, in October
1725, a separate relevancy was in like manner found<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And finds, that the pannels, at the time and place libelled, assembled themselves in arms, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” October 1, 1725.</NOTE> on
the act of assembling within burgh in arms; which indeed,
without the help of any other circumstance, is itself a plain
preparation of violence, and being so unusual an occurrence,
carries rumour, alarm, and agitation abroad with it, among
the people.</P>
<P>IN this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of art and part of Mobbing.</NOTE> and before proceeding to inquire con∣cerning
the punishment of mobbing, it will be proper to
attend to the doctrine of art and part, as applicable to
this offence, which is not of the same simple nature as
most other crimes, but often consists of a succession of
parts, which are performed by different persons, and on
several occasions. It is almost unnecessary to remark, that
in this instance, as in others, assistance is not held to con∣sist
exclusively in the lending of hands to do the acts of
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
violence which are perpetrated; but equally in every other
proceeding which occasions, facilitates, encourages, or in
anywise contributes to promote the common enterprise: so
that he who beats a drum to convocate the rioters, or who
reviles the Magistrate that comes to disperse them, or who
goes among the multitude and exhorts them to persist, or di∣stributes
liquor or money to them, to encourage them, is doubt∣less
art and part of all the outrages of which they are guilty
at that time. For this sort of heartening and countenance,
as sabstantially forwards the enterprise upon the whole, as
the aid of hands or force of body, in the execution of their
unlawful doings. I must here again take notice of the case of
John Fraser,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 6. 1784.</NOTE> who was adjudged to be transported for life, upon
conviction to this effect, “that he was present and active in
the mob and riotous assembly libelled, and that he grossly
insulted and abused the Sheriff, Mr Cockburn, in execution
of his duty.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 24. 1784.</NOTE> The conviction of Paul and Anderson was
in these words: That they were guilty “of exciting and
instigating a mob by beating a drum;” and of William
Welsh, that he “was concerned in exciting the mob, but
in a less degree.” Upon which verdict the two former
were punished with scourging and transportation for fourteen
years; and Welsh with imprisonment for six months, and
until he should find security to keep the peace for the space
of two years. This rule is farther exemplified in the case of
Captain Walter Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. &amp; 27. 1722.</NOTE> who was sined in L. 1000 Scots,
in pursuance of a verdict which convicted him of uttering
words of command or exhortation to an act of violence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find it proven, that John Clelland, one of the pannels, struck Bailie Se∣ton with the but-end of his musket, as he was going up the Council-house stairs; and that the said Captain Walter Hamilton, by using these words, <HI>Keep him down,</HI> or, <HI>Knock him down,</HI> is guilty art and part in the terms of the Lords interlocutor.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239"/>
IT is even a possible thing, that a person may justly be
convicted as art and part of a riot by instigating and exci∣ting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part by Instigation.</NOTE>
though he be not present on the spot where the acts of
violence are done. For if he be in such situation, that he
communicates with the active persons, and directs or has a
plain influence on their motions, as by sending money or
liquor to them from some short distance; the only differ∣ence
between him and them is in point of prudence, or of
boldness, and nowise in point of guilt. One instance of con∣viction
upon such a ground, (though certainly not to be men∣tioned
as an example of the just or proper application of
this rule), is the case of Alexander Keith, February 26.
1686; who was found art and part of a seditious meeting,
along with certain other persons, in an alehouse, where they
drank success to those who were engaged in a riot on the
street at the time, and promised liquor and money to all who
would go forth and assist them in their purpose<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The jury find the pannel Alexander Keith, guilty and culpable of being present at the seditious assembly, or meeting mentioned in his dittary, and of his joining with his accomplices, in his unlawful resolutions, and order to a tu∣mult; and art and part of the same seditious meeting, in respect they find the samin sufficiently proven by the witnesses depositions.”</NOTE>. The defect
of this case was, that the libel did not charge, nor did
the verdict distinctly find, that any sort of intercourse or
concert took place between Keith and any of the persons
who were active in the tumult, nor that any one engaged
in it at his desire or instigation; so that the accusation
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>
amounted to little more than the uttering of expressions of fa∣vour
to their cause. Keith, however, had sentence of death.</P>
<P>IN the next place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part by Presence.</NOTE> with respect to him who is present in
the mob, and witness of the riotous proceedings, the ques∣tion
arises, whether he is art and part of their offence pure∣ly
by his presence, although no circumstance of activity or
co-operation be proved against him. Now, as to this mat∣ter;
the only general doctrine that seems sit to be deli∣vered,
amounts to no more than this, that the question de∣pends
upon the <HI>animus</HI> or purpose with which the pannel
mingles in the assembly: in judging whereof, all the cir∣cumstances
of his situation will of course be weighed, and
a different decision be therefore given, according as upon
the whole evidence in the case, his presence shall appear to
have been accidental only, or owing to indiscretion, or with
a purpose to countenance and abet the unlawful doings.
Thus, on the streets of a burgh, a person may, for a short
time, be found among a mob, either innocently, or at least
excusably; being perhaps impeded by them in his passage,
or having stopped for a while to look at their proceedings, or
to inquire what they are about: and though he should even
follow them for a short way, and linger in the rear of the
multitude, it would be severe to construe this into an acces∣sion,
which may be mere heedlessness, or idle curiosity. In
this sense, I interpret the words of the verdict in the case of
David Black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 26. 1720.</NOTE> and others “finds it proven, that David
Black, Elias Ross, and James Bred, were only in compa∣ny
with that number of people convened upon the sands of
Ely;” upon which these persons were assoilzied, as not
being convicted of having <HI>joined,</HI> (in any proper sense), or be∣come
part of the riotous body.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241"/>
BUT, if a man is found in the throng, with his face black∣ed,
or in woman's apparel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and part of mobbing by Pre∣sence.</NOTE> or with a shirt over his coat; or
if upon search, a loaded pistol or a parcel of seditious hand∣bills
is found upon him; or if it be proved that he used the
watch-word of the rioters, or that he wore in his hat the badge
of the friends of the cause for that day; in all these and the
like cases, his presence is circumstanced in such a manner, as
fixes the purpose and disposition with which he came there;
and is a just ground for convicting him as art and part, though
there be no proof that he ever showed his arms, or hawked
the hand-bills, or gave assistance of deed, word, or gesture,
in the executive part of the business. In like manner, with∣out
the testimony of circumstances so decisive as these, susficient
evidence may still be found to the same effect, in the
length of time that the pannel has continued in the mob, or the
length of way he has gone along with them; if they be such
as are not reasonably to be reconciled with any other opinion
of his intention. If, for instance, at midnight, when he
ought to be with his family, and in bed, a mechanic or
working man is found in a mob at the distance of miles
from his home, and is proved to have accompanied them
from place to place, and on all those occasions to have
been in the throng of them, and without any pretence of
lawful business in that quarter of the country; what other
opinion can be formed of him, but that he is an asso∣ciate
in the enterprise; and is there to favour and promote
it? In all cases, therefore, where presence is attended with
the due accompaniments of this kind, it is by itself a law∣ful
ground of conviction. In truth, the presence of any
one who joins the multitude in this fashion, is itself a real
assistance; since it adds to their number, confidence, and
apparent force, and to the attendant terror and alarm,
which are their engines for execution of their lawless pro∣ject.
<PB N="241" REF="242"/>
The Judge cannot therefore listen to the plea of cu∣riosity
in such a case. For a curiosity of this anxious and
continued kind is not innocent nor excusable; nor is it pure
nor simple curiosity, but attended with favour to what is go∣ing
on: for who will put himself to so much trouble, to be
a witness of proceedings which he heartily disapproves?</P>
<P>I SHALL refer the reader to the following judgments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Art and Part by Presence.</NOTE> in evi∣dence
of the assent of our practice to this construction of the
law. On the 5th of August 1720, verdict was returned against
Thomas Gilkie, thus: “Find it <HI>proven,</HI> that Thomas Gilkie
was <HI>in the mob</HI> at the time libelled; but <HI>not proven</HI> that he
was seen taking away victual or breaking of houses or
shops.” Upon which Gilkie, who was a burgess of Dun∣dee,
was adjudged to be scourged through that burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 9. 1720.</NOTE> and
to lose his franchise as a burgess, and to be incapable of the
same in future. In like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 9. and May 12. 1741.</NOTE> William Gilchrist had
sentence of transportation for seven years, upon a verdict in
these terms: “Find, that at the time libelled, the mill pos∣sessed
by Charles Sawyers at Bell's Mills, was broke open
by a mob, and meal and kiln-pot oats carried off from
thence, and that the pannel was present <HI>at</HI> the said mob,
and <HI>while</HI> the meal was carried off; and do not find it pro∣ven
that the pannel was compelled to go <HI>thither by force,</HI>
nor that he was under any restraint while there; and, by
a plurality of voices, find no other part of the libel pro∣ven.”</P>
<P>A THIRD conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Art and Part by Presence.</NOTE> nearly to the same effect, was that
of Richard Robertson, on the 16th March 1773. “The jury
unanimously find it proved, that he was <HI>engaged in the
riot,</HI> in the house of Millfield; but do not find it proved
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
that he had <HI>any hand</HI> in demolishing or pulling down the
said house.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17. 1773.</NOTE> This pannel was transported for life. Add to
these the verdict in the case of Walter Buchanan, and others,
on the 14th October 1725: “Finds its proven that the above
Walter Buchanan was <HI>in</HI> the mob in Mr Campbell of Shaw∣field's
house, and <HI>in</HI> the mob at the guard, that threw
stones at the soldiers, and <HI>in</HI> that mob that brought back
the two soldiers as prisoners, <HI>and the said Buchanan having
a gun;</HI> as also, finds it proven that the said George Mac∣farlane
was <HI>in</HI> the mob in Mr Campbell of Shawfield's
house; as also, finds it proven that the above Patrick Mit∣chell
was <HI>in</HI> the mob in Mr Campbell of Shawfield's house;
as also, finds it proven the above Janet Balleny was <HI>in</HI>
the mob that drew the chariot along the streets towards
the Gorbals;” and as to William Hamilton, what they
find is, “that the above designed Hamilton, was <HI>in</HI> the
mob both on the street and in the house of Daniel Camp∣bell
of Shawfield.” Nothing is here found against Bal∣leny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 15. 1725.</NOTE>
Macfarlane, Mitchell, or Hamilton, but that they were
part of a riotous meeting, where certain things were done.
Yet all these pannels were adjudged to suffer high pains.
Balleny was twice pilloried; Buchanan, (who bore the gun),
and along with him Macfarlane and Hamilton, were scourged
and transported for life; and Mitchell was transported with∣out
being scourged.</P>
<P>THIS question may also arise concerning a person who is
present and actively engaged in a mob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Person Art and Part of one Act, is he of all?</NOTE> how far he is to be
held art and part of all their criminal proceedings. If a
great multitude separate, by agreement, into a number of
smaller bodies, which proceed to different places, where
they commit sundry outrages and mischiefs; here, though all
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
be done in execution of one great plan, (as, for instance, if
they destroy the gaols in the several quarters of the same
city); yet the proceedings of any one of these bodies are
only a proper charge against the persons who are present in
it, and witnesses of what is done: so that if one division,
after entering, have proceeded to burn a gaol, this cannot
be charged against the individuals in another party, who
have not gone to the same excess; whether this be owing
to want of inclination, or to other causes. Nevertheless,
in fixing the punishment of the several convicts, regard may
certainly be had to this circumstance, that the several out∣rages
are proved to be parts of the same commotion, and of
one great and extensive scheme of mischief, wherein all the
persons, in all the different parties, were leagued; and which
thus serves to aggravate the guilt of the particular proceed∣ings
of every portion of the confederates. The same seems
to be true with respect to any individual, who meets a mob
upon their passage, after execution of one outrageous act,
and who knowing this, proceeds with them to some other
quarter, where they complete their purpose. For although,
properly speaking, he is not art and part of what was done
before he joined the meeting, so as to be specially chargeable
with it in a libel; yet is he the more guilty, that he wil∣fully
associates himself to a set of persons who have already
proceeded to such excesses. This is even applicable to a tu∣mult,
which has a continuance for days: Those who engage
in the proceedings of the last days, are punishable the more
severely on account of the disorders of the former days,
which they deliberately ratify, when they join the force
which has been guilty of them, and renew the tumult.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245"/>
BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of one Act; is it of all?</NOTE> though it may in the case of so extensive a commo∣tion,
it will not in the common case be necessary, so nearly to
consider the degrees of activity of the several offenders, or the
particular acts of violence in which they have has a part.
In the construction of law, (and it cannot in reason be any
other), every member of the riotous assembly is art and part of
all the violences which are committed by any portion of that
assembly, while he continues in it; if they are the natural
and ordinary accompaniments of such a tumult, and are not
quite out of the verge and bounds of the original enterprise;
for they, all of them, suffer the things to be done, and are, by
their assembly, the cause why such things are possible to be
done, and are not resisted. In the case, therefore, of an ordi∣nary
mob, all the insults offered to passengers, all the hin∣derance
and obstruction of Magistrates and officers of the
law, all the threats of mischief to property and person, and in
general, all the disturbance, agitation and terror natural to
such occasions, are chargeable alike, against all the persons
who are on foot. In like manner, if a mob set out with the
declared resolution of burning a certain house, or killing a
certain person, which resolution they accordingly execute;
doubtless the guilt of the fire-raising or murder is common
to all who are zealous and active in that part of the enterprise,
though it should not appear that they are the very persons
who wounded or applied the fire: for they are all mutually,
and not remotely assistant, in the direct steps and preparations
thereto, and cannot therefore be held to be without con∣cern
in the event. In the case, for instance, of the Porteous
mob, the guilt of the murder was not peculiar to him who
fixed the rope about the neck of the unfortunate victim on
that occasion, or otherwise laid hand upon him at the time of
his execution: It was equally the crime of all who were active
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
in breaking up the door of the gaol, or who attended the
deceased in arms to the place of his death, or who took
any other the like forward part in hastening his destruction.
Nay, if it had even been proved with respect to any indivi∣dual,
that the quitted the assembly after assisting to break up
the door of the gaol and pull forth the deceased; still the
same judgment would have been due to him; since whe∣ther
he retired out of policy, or fear, or even out of repen∣tance,
it was to no purpose, after so materially promoting a
catastrophe, which he from first knew to be resolved on,
and to be then no longer possible to be prevented.</P>
<P>THE terms in which I have delivered their rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if Some∣thing be done remote from the Purpose of the Mob.</NOTE> imply the
exception of those cases, where something is done by a part
of the assembly, and without the assent or perhaps the know∣ledged
of the others, which is quite away from the scope, or
out of the bounds of the original design. Thus if a mob re∣pair
to the storehouse of a dealer in grain, with intent to
cause him fell to them at their own price; and if, while this
is doing, some of the party secretly enter on another side
and set fire to the house; this seems to be the peculiar guilt
of these who apply the fire: because it is not done in prose∣cution
of the original and common enterprise; though this
facilitates and gives occasion to the other.</P>
<P>II. To proceed to the punishment of mobbing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for Mobbing.—Roman Law.</NOTE> This we
shall first examine, as it stands at common law; and next we
shall inquire into the supplemental provisions which have
been made by statute. Resorting to the Roman law as an
authority in that matter, we find that this delict, which
fell under the sanction of the <HI>Lex Julia de vi Publica,</HI> was
variously punished, according to the degree of the violence,
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
and the rank of the offender; with deportation in ordinary
cases, but sometimes with death, especially in offenders of
low degree. This severity was in particular used with re∣spect
to those transgressors, who broke into or rifled a
dwelling-house, <HI>si quidem in turba cum telo fecerint;</HI> but un∣derstanding
by arms in this case, all offensive weapons,
“<HI>ex quibus singuli homines nocere possunt</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 11. tit. 6. lib. 48. Dig. ad L. Jul. de vi Pub.</NOTE>.” And truly this
course of punishment for those more atrocious disorders, seems
worthy to be approved of, as a very salutary part of the
Roman practice. For if we consider the danger with respect
to the public; what so necessary as a strong curb to those
sudden and outrageous effusions of rage, to which the giddy
multitude are so liable; and which are so much more ter∣rible
in their consequences, as well as so much more conta∣gious
in the example, than the crimes of single persons?
And with respect also to the individual; whether it be that
his house is burned, or his effects plundered and destroyed, or
his person assaulted and wounded in his dwelling; surely his
sufferings are not the less on such occasions, (or rather they
are in some respects much higher), that these things are not
done by an individual, (in whom any of them would be a
capital offence), but by a whole host of foes, of whom he
cannot know how far their wantonness and cruelty will
carry them.</P>
<P>So it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punishment of Mobbing at Common Law.</NOTE> however, that our common law does not seem to
have taken this view of the subject; but rather to have at∣tended
to those humane considerations, which may be urged
for the offender in alleviation of his guilt; to the indiscre∣tion
of youth, the ignorance of the low and uneducated, the
pressure of want on some occasions, the seduction of example,
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
and the temptation of present opportunity: causes, it is sup∣posed,
which may sometimes ensnare such persons who are
not habitually profligate, nor in the course of forming sepa∣rate
projects of violence or plunder for themselves. On these,
or some such views, it probably is, that our custom interposes
to save the life of the rioter, how great soever the excesses
against property or person which have been committed;
if the libel is laid at common law, for the crime of mobbing
or convocation of the lieges, and not for any higher or more
special denomination of crime. This lenient construction
was in particular followed in that numerous set of trials
which took place in the months of May, June and July
1720, for the extensive commotions occasioned at that pe∣riod,
by the high prices of grain. Very great excesses, of
different kinds, were charged in the indictments: The tu∣multuous
and forcible entry of ships and granaries; the pre∣donious
seizing, destroying, and embezzling of grain; the bo∣ring
of the bottoms, and cutting of the tackle and rigging of
ships; the beating and wounding of obnoxious persons to the
effusion of their blood; the assaulting and wounding of Ma∣gistrates;
the entering of shops and houses, by essraction of
doors and windows, and the destroying, rifling and plunder∣ing
of the owner's furniture, merchandise and effects<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Aug. 3. 1720. “Find that the pannels, or either of them, the time and place libelled, their having assembled themselves with others, in a tumultuous man∣ner, did forcibly unload, plunder, carry away or embezzle, quantities of vic∣tual out of a ship or ships, lying in the harbour of Dundee; or that the saids pan∣nels, or either of them, being so tumultuously assembled as said is, did break into or forcibly enter the house, shop or warehouse of George Dempster, or any other house or houses within the town of Dundee; or did break down, <HI>embezzle,</HI> or take away household furniture, merchant-ware, or any other ef∣fects out of any of the said shops or houses; or that the saids pannels or either of them, was art and part of any of the facts above mentioned, <HI>separatim,</HI> re∣levant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” This is the interlocutor on the case of John Buntine, Thomas Gilkie, and others, which I have selected out of many of that time, as one of the strongest instances.</NOTE>. Yet
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
in no one instance was the libel found relevant to infer the
pain of death, as far as the charge was laid at common law,
and for the crime of mobbing only.</P>
<P>A STILL stronger evidence of the same rule is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mobbing not ca∣pital at Com∣mon Law.</NOTE> however,
to be found in the trials that ensued upon the great tumult
at Glasgow, (commonly called Shawfield's Mob), which
happened on occasion of the passing of the malt tax. The
first of these was the trial of James and William Darrach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 17. 1725.</NOTE>.
and others, who were charged with injuries of the highest
kind, and particularly with the following: The forcible en∣try
of a dwelling-house, by effraction of the doors and win∣dows;
the breaking, plundering, and away-taking of all
the effects within the house, to a great value; the assem∣bling
with warlike weapons by beat of drum; attacking a
body of his Majesty's forces, and pursuing them to a consi∣derable
distance; taking some of the soldiers prisoners,
and beating them to the great danger of their lives. Yet
were all these outrages found only relevant to infer an arbi∣trary
punishment; aggravated as they were, in being done
on account of a public law, and out of malice to an indivi∣dual,
for his conduct as representative in Parliament of the
burgh where these excesses happened<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords finds the pannels, at the time and place libelled, that their assembling themselves tumultuously or riotously, or invading, or violently breaking into the house libelled, or the carrying away, or breaking or de∣stroying, any of the goods or furniture thereof, or their being art and part of the same, or any of these facts, <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment, (here follows a clause on the riot act); and finds the breaking and defacing the statues, or other ornaments of the house or gardens, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and finds, that the pannels, or any of them; at the time and place libelled, assaulted or invaded the guard, especially with stones or batons, consisting of his Majesty's forces, or being art and part there∣of, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and finds, that the pannels, at the time and place libelled, assembled themselves in arms, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” September 30. 1725.</NOTE> The same judgment
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
was afterwards given upon the libel raised against Walter
Buchanan and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 11. 1725.</NOTE> for accession to the same tumult. On
both occasions, several of the pannels were convicted, and
had sentence of transportation and other inferior pains.</P>
<P>NEITHER do the Judges of later times seem to have enter∣tained
a different opinion of the law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mobbing, not ca∣pital at Com∣mon Law.</NOTE> As appears from the
sentence of transportation in the case of Richard Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17. 1773.</NOTE>
who was convicted as art and part of a mob, which forcibly
broke into and riffled the house of Millfield. And as also
appears from the interlocutor on the libel against John Fra∣ser,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1784.</NOTE>
which, as far as laid at common law, is found only re∣levant
to infer an arbitrary punishment; though it charges
that a building was invaded, and that a hay-stack, carts,
and other effects, were burned and destroyed.</P>
<P>THUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Fire∣raising by a Rio∣ter; if Capital.</NOTE> upon the whole, there seems to be no authority
for saying, that any mischief or depredation of this sort,
when prosecuted under the name of mobbing, and with
the purpose, consequently, of inferring art and part against
the several members of the assembly, from their presence
and countenance on the occasion, is acknowledged as a
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
capital crime, in the practice of Scotland. But from this it does
not follow, nor am I sure that it is law, that from the same facts,
materials may not sometimes be extracted for a relevant and
capital charge of stouthrief, house-breaking, theft, or fire-raising,
against an individual, upon the special narrative of his
particular deed. If the libel bear the crime of murder as
well as riot in the major proposition, and if the minor charge
the pannel; that having gone with a mob to the house of
James, to deface and pillage it, and James having stood on
his defence, he the pannel, with a pistol, fired at and killed
him; certainly this is as relevant a charge of murder, as if
the pannel had lain in wait for James, or had entered the
house, alone, with intent to kill him. The case of Mac∣lauchlane,
one of the Porteous mob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, No. 93.</NOTE> in 1737, is here in
point: for he was charged with wilful murder, as well as
riot and other crimes; and the libel was found relevant ge∣nerally
to infer the pains of law. There is also a precedent
with respect to the crime of fire-raising committed by a
mob.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 1784.</NOTE> I allude to the trial of William Spence, who was
charged with the fire-raising as well as mobbing<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Major.</HI> “As also, wilful fire-raising, and consuming by fire, any such houses, buildings, &amp;c. are crimes of an heinous nature, and severely punish∣able.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Minor.</HI> And you the said William Spence not only was active in exciting and encouraging the said mob, but did with your own hands deliberately assist in setting fire to one or more of the buildings of the said distillery, or houses adjoining thereto, whereby the house called the still-house, &amp;c. were burnt down and destroyed, nothing being left but the stone walls.”</P></NOTE>, upon this
narrative; that having attacked and broken into a distillery,
at the head of an outrageous multitude, he did with his
own hands deliberately assist in setting fire to it; where∣by
several of the buildings were consumed and destroyed.
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
This charge was accordingly sustained to infer the proper
pains of that atrocious crime; for in this sense the Court ex∣plained
to the jury the general terms of their interlocutor,
which found the libel relevant to infer <HI>the pains of law.</HI> The
fact was fully proved, as related in the libel; but the pan∣nel
had the good fortune, nevertheless, to have a verdict re∣turned
in his favour.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge of House-breaking against a Rioter; if Competent.</NOTE> according to the analogy of these cases, there seems
to be the same reason for sustaining the charge of stouth∣rief
or house-breaking, with respect to any individual in the
mob, against whom a set of facts, sufficiently special, can be
established. As if it be proved, that the pannel forced open
a window, beat a cabinet in pieces, and carried off the valu∣able
contents; which are afterwards found secreted in his
possession, or disposed of by him, for money, to others. Such
a charge seems to possess the full distinctive qualifications
of stouthrief. The spoil is not destroyed out of malice, but
is taken away for lucre; and it is taken by proceedings of
the same kind, (only still more violent), as in any other case
of stouthrief. This material distinction, however, there is
between such a charge, and the charge of the like facts as
an act of riot, that they will not be subject to the same con∣struction
as to the matter of art and part. Under an indict∣ment
for mobbing, the bare presence and assent of the pan∣nel
at the time when the house is entered and riffled, is a
lawful ground on which to find him guilty of the charge;
because in this way he becomes a member of that tumultu∣ous
meeting in which those outrages are openly done; which
is the complex and general accusation against him and them.
But if the trial is to be for house-breaking, or stouthrief, the
pannel's special concern in the seizure or removal of the par∣ticular
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
thing must be brought home to him, to justify his
conviction in that sort; and the libel must charge him with
the fact, in the same articulate fashion as in any ordinary
case. The difficulty of procuring the necessary evidence to
this effect, is probably the reason why such atrocious injuries
have ordinarily been tried under the name of mobbing only.</P>
<P>WE have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rioter libelled for House-break∣ing.</NOTE> however, three instances at least of a charge of
theft and house-breaking sustained upon such grounds;
though in none of them prosecuted to a capital issue. On
the 18th June 1716, Allan Guthrie is indicted for theft
and house-breaking<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Major.</HI> “That contrary to the laws of this and all other well governed nations, whereby <HI>the crime of theft and house-breaking,</HI> odious in themselves, are punishable with the pains of death, and confiscation of moveables, he the said Allan Guthrie did commit the said crimes; in so far as,” &amp;c.</NOTE>; in as much as he forced entry of
the Customhouse at Leith; broke up a chest therein, and
stole out of it a bag of foreign gold. The pannel answers,
that it is notorious that the house was pillaged by an arm∣ed
host of Highlanders, in open day; whom if the pannel
joined, he might be guilty of spuilzie, or riot, or perhaps
of treason, but in nowise of theft; which is a clandestine
crime, that is done for the sake of lucre, and not as here,
<HI>animo ulsciscendi.</HI> And he concludes with pleading, that since
the charge is made under no other name but that of theft,
he may be assoilzied in this process, leaving it to the pro∣secutor
to indict him for a riot, as accords. The prosecutor,
without much disputing that the mode and occasion of the
house-breaking were such as alleged by the pannel, restricts
his libel to an arbitrary punishment; and contends, that the
crime is not the less a theft on account of those accom∣panyments
<PB N="253" REF="254"/>
of numbers and open violence; and that as such
it may competently be tried, although it might also have
been libelled under other appellations. Upon this debate, the
Court repel the defences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2. 1716.</NOTE> and find it relevant against the
pannel, “his having at the time libelled, in company with
others, broke open a wooden box or chest in the said Cus∣tomhouse,
and taking out thereof all or any of the pieces
and species of gold libelled, or being art and part there∣in.”
It is separately found relevant to the same effect,
“the pannel his having, the time libelled, in company with
others, broke open the doors of the Customhouse of Leith,
or being art and part therein.” The verdict was in fa∣vour
of the pannel.</P>
<P>THE second instance of this kind is the case of John In∣nes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rioter indicted for House-break∣ing.</NOTE>
where the charge in the major proposition of the libel,
is of house-breaking, robbery, and stouthrief<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“That where by the law of God, the laws of this and all well govern∣ed realms, <HI>house-breaking, robbery, and stouthrief, are crimes of a very heinous nature,</HI> and severely punishable, especially when committed under cloud of night, by persons in great numbers, in breach of the public peace, and mani∣fest violation of his Majesty's laws: Yet, true it is,” &amp;c. The jury found the libel not proven.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 13. 1727.</NOTE> The minor
relates that Innes, with his associates, tumultuously assem∣bled,
to the number of 100 or more, and armed with fire∣arms,
swords, and other offensive weapons, made an attack
upon the Excise-office in the town of Elgin; and having fired
through the doors and windows, violently forced entry of the
house, and masterfully robbed and carried off from thence
640 gallons of spirits, and other parcels of goods, there
lodged for his Majesty's behoof. The defence is the same as
in the case of Guthrie; that this is not a charge of house-breaking,
stouthrief or robbery, the crimes set forth in
the indictment, but of riot, or forcible rescue from the
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
revenue-officers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20. 1727.</NOTE> The Lord Advocate restricts his conclu∣sions
to an arbitrary punishment, and the libel is found rele∣vant
as laid. Now, as in both instances, the charge was made
under the denominations only of house-breaking, theft, and
stouthrief; I think the pannel argued justly, that if not rele∣vant
in this form, the libel fell to be dismissed, and could
not, by any restriction of the conclusions, be made a proper
ground of punishment.</P>
<P>IN the third cafe, that of William Gilchrist, in March
1741, which was for breaking into a mill, and carrying off
a quantity of grain, the charge of robbery and house-break∣ing<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“That where by the laws of this and other well governed realms, <HI>robbery, house-breaking,</HI> the violent invading or taking away of the properties of another, especially when committed under cloud of night, and by numbers of people assembled in a riotous or seditious manner; the stirring up, moving or promo∣ting,” &amp;c.</NOTE> was coupled to that of riot; and, after hearing an ar∣gument
to the same purpose as in the other cases, the Court ex∣plicitly
sustained the charge in all its forms; finding “the
libel, and several articles thereof, relevant to infer the
pains of law.” The jury, however, did not convict the
pannel of either theft or house-breaking, but of presence only
in a <HI>mob,</HI> while the grain was carried off; and the man in
consequence had sentence of transportation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">March 13. 1741. “Find, that at the time libelled, the mill possessed by Charles Sawers at Bell's Mills was broke open by a mob, and meal and kiln∣pot oats carried off from thence, and that the pannel was present at the said mob, and while meal was carried off; and do not find it proven that the pan∣nel was compelled to go thither by force, nor that he was under any restraint while there.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256"/>
IT is true, that in the debate upon the libel against Bu∣chanan,
Hamilton, and others, (in October 1725), offer was
made to prove with respect to Hamilton, that he had carried
off and disposed of a valuable jewel, the property of Mr
Campbell; on which account it was contended, but without
success, that Hamilton was punishable with death as a rob∣ber.
But no mention had been made of this matter in the
libel, which was laid throughout, as for the mischievous
pillaging, robbing and demolishing of the house, by a mob,
out of revenge. Therefore, without disputing the compe∣tency
of prosecution in another shape, the pannel answered
justly, “That it is out of time for the pursuer to alter
the shape of his libel from an injury, which is but an atro∣cious
trespass, to robbery, which is capitally punished, or
to condescend upon the species of goods now, when the
pannel stands upon his trial at the bar.”</P>
<P>UPON the whole of these proceedings, joined with the
strong reasons in the nature of the thing itself, there seems
to be room for doubting, whether, when the proper case for
trial of such a charge shall happen, it may not be found re∣levant
to infer the forfeiture of life and goods.</P>
<P>THUS much of the pains of mobbing at common law.
Let us next inquire how far our statutes have aggravated
these, in cases of a more flagitious or alarming kind.</P>
<P>IT is obvious, that all such commotions are far more dan∣gerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Commotion within Burgh.</NOTE>
and need to be repressed with greater severity, within
towns than in the country. Because there the profligate and
licentious are collected in great numbers, ready to lay hold
of any occasion of disorder, to soment and push it to every
excess of mischief and rapacity. There too, great wealth and
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
property are gathered together into a small compass; where
it lies an easy prey, and in a manner a temptation to the in∣vaders,
who in a few hours may make themselves master of the
spoil. Above all, the crowd of inhabitants is to be consider∣ed,
of all ages and conditions, whose peace is broken by
the tumult; and who, on such occasions, are as apt to alarm
and distress, as to assist each other, by their frequent and
near communication. Our Legislature, accordingly, are
said to have attended to the peculiar exigencies of this situa∣tion,
and to have made suitable provisions for it in aid of
the common law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1457, c. 77.</NOTE> A statute of James II. ordains, “That
within the burrowes throwout the realme, na leagues nor
bandes be maid, nor zit na commotion nor rising of com∣mounes
<HI>in hindering of the commoun law,</HI> but at the com∣mandement
of their head officiar. And gif ony dois in the
contrarie, and knawledge and taint may be gotten thereof,
their gudes that ar foundin guiltie therein, to be consiscat
to the King, and their lives at the Kingis will.”</P>
<P>THIS is re-enacted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Commotion within Burgh.</NOTE> in almost the same words, by the act
1491, c. 34.; and both are renewed by the act 1606, c. 17.
which ratifies and approves, “All and whatsoever acts made
heretofore for staying of all tumults, and unlawful meet∣ings
and conventions within burgh;” and appoints the
offenders, “to be punished in their bodies, goods, and geare,
with all rigour, conforme to the lawes of this realme.”</P>
<P>The fundamental law, is, therefore, the act of James II.
which the others only reintegrate; and whereof the pecu∣liar
object was to punish, (as the words are), “all commotion
or rising of commons in hindering of the common law.”
Now this is a peculiar, and not very precise phrase; but
which, as far as I can judge, was at one period held to be
<PB N="257" REF="258"/>
applicable to any tumult that was in hinderance of the course
of public justice, or of lawful and established authority; For
instance, to obstruct the apprehending, imprisoning, or exe∣cution
of criminals; to break open gaols and set free the
prisoners; to invade or molest courts of justice in their sit∣tings;
to resist the raising of the militia, or the levying of
a supply; all these and the like contemptuous enterprises,
in defiance of the order of law and the power of the State,
seem to have fallen under the received construction of the
foregoing phrase: Because in such cases not only some∣thing
is done that is unlawful, (which is true of every sort
of violence), but something is hindered, which the law has
commanded to be done, and has made costly establishments
to enforce. Certain it is, that on the 8th of February 1686,
David Moubray had sentence of death; being convicted,
by his own confession, of art and part in a tumult, which
rescued a criminal from the officers of justice in the execu∣tion
of a sentence of whipping. And, on the 26th of the same
month, Alexander Keith had the like sentence, as formerly
mentioned, for a more remote concern in the same commotion.</P>
<P>BESIDE the foregoing statute, there is another, which
also was the ground, in former times, of more than one pro∣secution
for the highest pains. I allude to the act passed in.
the reign of Queen Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563, c. 83.</NOTE> and entitled, “<HI>Ament the stancheing
of tumults within burrowes,</HI>” wherein it is ordered, “That
naine of our Soveraine Ladies lieges presume, pretende,
or take upon hand to make onie privie conventiones nor
assemblies within burgh, put on armour, cleeith them∣selves
with weapones, or make sound of trumpet or talbrone,
or use culveringes, displayed banners, hand seinzies, or
uthers instruments bellical quhatsumever, in onie time
heireafter, without the special licence of our said Sove∣raine
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
Lady, and her Hienes Magistrates within the burgh,
quhair the said tumult and uproare chauncis to be, had
and obtained theirto under the paine of death.”</P>
<P>UPON this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions on these statutes. Nov. 26. 1664.</NOTE> along with the others, indictment was raised
against John Strachan, for convocating an armed mob in the
city of Edinburgh, who marched to the house of Sir Wil∣liam
Seton, farmer of the customs, which they broke into
and riffled; as well as they resisted a party of soldiers that
was sent to quell them. The libel concluded for the pains
of death and confiscation of moveables; and the Lord Advo∣cate
insisted to the same effect in the debate upon the charge,
“The Justice-depute sustains the libel as it is libelled and
declared by my Lord Advocate, and ordains the same to
pass to the knowledge of an assize; and declares that he
sustains the presence with the being in arms, and deeds of
accession libelled.” An irregularity in the proceedings
prevented this case from coming to an issue.</P>
<P>THE next example is the trial of Alexander Clunie and
others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 6. 1682.</NOTE> where the charge was of a convocation in Edinburgh,
who forced the drummers of the King's militia to beat for
them, compelled the enlargement of prisoners from the Ca∣nongate
gaol, took possession of the keys of the city gates,
and insulted certain Privy Counsellors who interposed to stay
the tumult. It does not appear, that the multitude in this case,
nor any part of them, were provided with warlike weapons.
But the prosecutor, availing himself of the circumstance of
the alarm having been given to the mob by beat of drum, or
<HI>talbrone,</HI> strenuously contended, that the several qualities men∣tioned
in the act of Mary, (for the libel was mainly laid up∣on
that law), were not to be taken jointly, but separately;
so that death might be inflicted for any tumult, where any
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
one of those qualities occurred. To this (as I must think it)
unreasonable construction, (for the statute was plainly made
for repressing assemblies <HI>in arms</HI>), the Judges of that time gave
their assent; and delivered their interlocutor thus: “Finds
the convocation libelled, as it is circumstantiate and qua∣lified,
relevant, any one of the circumstances being pro∣ven,
to infer a capital punishment; and that the pannels
being present, and did assist or concur, by deeds or words,
in the said tumult, although without arms, is relevant to
infer art and part thereof against them.” The assize
found it proved, “That Alexander Clunie was present and
apprehendit in the stair of Sir George Kinnaird his cham∣ber,
at the tyme when a part of that seditious and tumul∣tuous
rabble did invade these Lords of his Majesty's Privy
Council condescendit on in the indictment, but his con∣curring
or assisting by deeds or words not proven.” I
conjecture that this verdict had not been to the satisfaction of
the Court; for the following addition is subjoined to it in
the record. “The assize having <HI>again</HI> considered the with∣in
verdict, by plurality of voices adhered thereto, in re∣spect
they find nothing proven but naked presence at the
invasion.” After all, Clunie was remanded to prison,
until farther order with respect to him; and how he was in
the end disposed of, the record does not inform me.</P>
<P>ANOTHER precedent upon the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions on these Statutes.</NOTE> but by no means
liable to the like strong objections as the last, occurred a
few years after;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 2. 1691.</NOTE> the case of Captain James Bruce, who was
prosecuted upon this and the other statutes above mentioned,
for ordering a convocation of soldiers in arms within the city
of Edinburgh, and assaulting the city guard; in which tu∣mult
several soldiers of the guard were killed. The Court
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
found the libel relevant to infer the pain of death<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds that part of the libel anent the pannel's giving command to drum∣mers to beat an alarum in the Canongate, for gathering of souldiers to their as∣sistance, and the souldiers gathering thereon, and possessing themselves of the Netherbow Port, and seizing upon some of the town's Captains, and making them prisoners, relevant to infer the pain of death libelled against the giver of the said command.”</NOTE>. He
was acquitted of the command to convocate, but was con∣victed
as art and part of the slaughter, and had sentence ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>IT appears that shortly after this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Construction of these Laws altered.</NOTE> doubts had come
to be entertained respecting the true object or these sta∣tutes;
whether they did not relate only to regular leagues
and bonds, or confederacies to raise and maintain men in
arms against the Government, on pretence of public grievan∣ces,
and had been strained in being applied to occasional
tumults on account of local incidents, or for private causes.
What was, perhaps, of at least equal weight; there concur∣red
with these grounds a general dislike of the statutes
themselves, on account of the oppressive use which had been
made of them in some of the foregoing cases. So it is, that
in the next trial after that of Captain Bruce, we find the be∣ginning
of a milder interpretation of this part of the law;
which not only has not been departed from in later times,
but has gradually been extended, to the entire abandonment,
in the end, of the benefit of the capital sanction.</P>
<P>I NOW allude to the trial of Charles Weir and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of these Laws alter∣ed.</NOTE>
which was for a great tumult in the city of Edinburgh, by
persons armed with swords and other mortal weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22. 1700.</NOTE> who
invaded the city gaol, forced entry thereof by fire, set free
<PB N="261" REF="262"/>
several prisoners for crimes, and deforced the Magistrates in
their exertions to quell them. It was thus both an armed
assembly within burgh, in which the bare act of presence in
arms was capital, according to the statute of Mary, as ex∣plained
in the case of Strachan; and it was also an assem∣bly
in hinderance of the common law, wherein it was ca∣pital
to assist or concur, according to the customary con∣struction
of the act of James II. But the interlocutor found
the libel relevant to infer death against those pannels only,
who had lent a special assistance with hammers or with war∣like
weapons, in the burning or breaking up of the prison
doors or fastenings, or in the invasion of the town's guard.
Those who had assisted in the foresaid acts with rung or ba∣ton,
or who had even assisted with warlike weapons, if it
was only in the convocation at large, and not in the effrac∣tion
of the gaol, were found only liable to an arbitrary pu∣nishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">July 29. 1700. “Find that part of the libel, of having a drawn sword or biggonet, or other bellical instrument, or forehammers, and thereby assisting by presence, at the burning of the tolbooth-door, for effraction thereof, or by set∣ting of fire to the said gate, or feeding of the fire when sett to, or by entering the prison thereafter, and assisting at the breaking up of the cheeklock, or in∣vading of the town-guards, relevant, <HI>separatim,</HI> to infer the pains of death li∣belled; and find, the acting and assisting with drawn sword, biggonet or dag∣ger, in the convocation, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and finds, the assisting with a rung or baton, at the burning or breaking up of the tol∣booth-door, or cheeklock, or at the invading of the guard, also relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>. Weir and Easton were convicted of being in
the gaol with drawn sword and durk, after the burning of
the doors; and Aitchison, at the same period, with a sword
undrawn; and these persons were, in consequence, variously
punished, with whipping, pillory, and banishment from Scot∣land.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263"/>
THE next remarkable set of trials for mobbing, were those
in 1720; at which time a number of prosecutions took place
on account of the many tumults in Fife, and some of the
neighbouring counties, occasioned by the high prices of
grain. Violent as the disorders on that occasion were, it
might however be questioned, how far any of them fell un∣der
either of the statutes above mentioned, even, according
to the sense, which in some former cases had been put upon
them. It is certain, that the act of Mary was not libelled
in any one instance; and as far as laid upon the other Scots
statutes, or at common law, the charge was invariably found
relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment only.</P>
<P>BUT on the next occasion after these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The construction of these Laws al∣tered.</NOTE> that of the great
tumult in Glasgow, already so often mentioned, there was a
more favourable opportunity than had yet happened, of try∣ing
how far these ordinances were still in force, and to what
objects they properly applied. For this was a case of very great
and formidable convocation within burgh, called by beat of
drum, and consisting of persons equipped with fire-arms
and other warlike weapons; and who after assembling for
that precise purpose, invaded and drove out of the burgh a
party of his Majesty's forces; and of which party they
made two soldiers prisoners, whom they abused to the danger
of their lives; beside endeavouring to hinder the reception of
the party into a neighbouring burgh, whither for safety they
retired. The acts of James and Mary, as well as others, were
therefore libelled; and the whole circle of argument relative
to this matter was anxiouisly debated. The result was a judg∣ment,
finding that these high charges, equally as that of pil∣laging
the house of an individual, were only relevant to in∣fer
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">September 30. 1725. “Finds, that the pannels, at the time and place li∣belled, assembled themselves in arms, relevant to infer ane arbitrary punish∣ment; and finds, that the defence offered, viz. that the pannels provided them∣selves with arms by order of the Magistrates, is relevant to exculpate them from the crime of simply assembling themselves in arms; and finds, that the pannels or any of them, at the times and places libelled, pursued his Majesty's forces when they retyred from Glasgow, and more especially that they pursued them with arms, or drums, or warlike weapons, or in a hostile warlike man∣ner, to retyre to Dunbarton, in manner, and on the occasion lybelled, or that they were art and part of the same, or any of the saids facts, relevant to infer ane arbitrary punishment; and finds, that the pannels or any of them did en∣deavour to excite the inhabitants of the town of Dunbarton to rise in arms, or oppose the said troops or forces, or to refuse to give them admittance into their town, or that they were art and part thereof, relevant to infer ane arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>. On the 4th October 1725,
the Justice-General, Lord Ilay, who presided on this occa∣sion,
inserted the following protest against the interlocutor:
“Whereas in obedience to the law and forms of pro∣ceeding
in this Court, I have signed the afore written in∣terlocutor,
as President, I think it my duty to declare
that part of the said interlocutor which finds the break∣ing
with violence into a person's house, and carrying
away his goods, and that part which finds the pursuing
with an armed force his Majesty's troops, relevant to in∣fer
an arbitrary punishment <HI>only,</HI> are both of them in my
humble opinion contrary to law.” Since that time, the
same question has not again been moved. In all later cases,
either these statutes have not been libelled at all; or they
have only been urged in confirmation of the common law,
and not as grounds of pronouncing sentence of death.</P>
<P>THIS alteration of practice is of the less moment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riot-Act, 1st Geo. I. c. 5.</NOTE> that the
place of those ancient statutes is in a great measure sup∣plied
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
by one of modern date; the act of the 1st Geo. I. c. 5.
commonly called the <HI>Riot-Act,</HI> which passed at the accession
of the House of Hanover, and on account of the many tumults
which the political divisions of that time gave rise to; but
which proving an useful supplement to the law, has been al∣lowed
to stand unrepealed, after that reason has long been at
an end. It contains two principal provisions, of which one
is in these words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clause against the demolishing of Buildings.</NOTE> “That if any persons unlawfully, rio∣tously
and tumultuously assembled together, to the distur∣bance
of the public peace, shall unlawfully, and with force,
demolish or pull down, or begin to demolish or pull down,
any church or chapel, or any building for religious wor∣ship,
certified and registered according to the statute made
in the first year of the reign of the late King William and
Queen Mary, intituled, &amp;c. or any dwelling-house, barn,
stable, or other out-house, that then every such demolish∣ing
or pulling down, or beginning to demolish or pull
down, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of clergy,
and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons, and
shall suffer death, as in case of felony, without benefit of
clergy.”</P>
<P>OUR first trial upon this part of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of that clause.</NOTE> was that of the
Darrachs, in September 1725; where judgment was given
upon the meaning of the words, “beginning to pull down
or demolish.” The question was, whether it should be
held to be an inception of demolishing, that the doors and
window sashes of a house were torn down; and in this article,
the Court distinguished between these acts committed from
without, and in order to gain entrance of the building, and
the same acts done from within, after obtaining entrance,
and with intent, therefore, to destroy the building. To tear
down the partitions, or the panelling of the apartments, or
<PB N="265" REF="266"/>
the slates or lead from the roof, was in the same trial resolv∣ed
to be within the meaning of the act; and the contrary was
held with respect to the destruction of statues, vases, and the
other exterior ornaments of the house and gardens<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the pannels, or any of them, their beginning to demolish the house libelled, by breaking or pulling down with force, the doors and windows, af∣ter the saids pannels had entered the said house, or being art and part of the same, relevant to infer the pain of death, and consiscation of moveables; and find the pannels, or any of them, that they did at the time and place libelled, did with forge-hammers, or otherwise, knock down the partitions in the house, or part of the same, or pull down the linings or part thereof, or broke down the roof or part thereof, or pulled away or destroyed the sclates or lead, or were art and part of the same, or any of the said facts, relevant to infer the pain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of death, and confiscation of moveables.”</NOTE>. The
pannels were not convicted of the capital part of the charge.</P>
<P>THE only way of destroying a house that comes under
the expressions of the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of that clause.</NOTE> is by tearing it to pieces, and not
by burning, blowing up, nor otherwise; as indeed it was the
pulling down of the dissenting meeting-houses, that princi∣pally
gave occasion to the passing of this law. But although
these were the immediate objects of protection at the time;
all dwelling-houses, barns, stables, or other out-houses, are
however under the same safeguard, by the express words
of the act. It is also to be remembered with respect to
this clause of the statute, that it creates a capital offence,
which is quite independent of the proclamation to disperse;
and of any of the several circumstances of guilt and con∣tempt,
which are required under the other and leading ar∣ticle
of the enactment.</P>
<P>THAT part of the riot act is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clause as to Assembly to the Number of Twelve.</NOTE> like the former, an en∣tire
new provision, but a renewal only, though with material
<PB N="266" REF="267"/>
additions, of what had formerly been enacted, for a time,
by statute, 1. Mary, stat. 2. c. 12. and 1. Elisabeth, c. 16.
Under these laws, if persons being assembled to the num∣ber
of twelve, should practise, intend, or go about to
commit, any of the unlawful actions therein set forth,
(among which, beside others of a higher nature, was the
burning of houses, barns, or stacks of corn, the breaking of
sences, warrens or dove-houses, the abating of rents or the
prices of grain), and should continue so assembled for the
space of an hour after proclamation made to them to dis∣perse;
or should afterwards persist in their unlawful at∣tempt;
this was made felony, but within the benefit of
clergy. In imitation of this model, the act of the 1st of
George makes the like provision, more generally, with re∣spect
to every case of persons riotously or tumultuously as∣sembled,
for any purpose whatsoever, to the number of twelve,
and prescribes the form of the proclamation to be made to
them to disperse, and declares “that then such continuing to∣gether”
(that is for the space of an hour), “to the number
of twelve or more, after such command or request made by
proclamation, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of
clergy, and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons,
and shall suffer death, as in case of felony, without benefit
of clergy.”</P>
<P>THE persons whom the statute authorises to make procla∣mation
to this effect are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who have Right to make Procla∣mation.</NOTE> for the counties, any one Justice of
Peace, or the Sheriff, or Under Sheriff; and for a burgh any
Justice of Peace for the same, or the Mayor, Bailif, or other
head-officer. It does not therefore, in either territory, fall
within the commission of an ordinary constable or peace-offi∣cer
to employ this expedient; which point was indeed in some
measure decided in the trial of Andrew Fairney and others,
<PB N="267" REF="268"/>
of the 18th July 1720. The libel in that case had charged the
proclamation to have been made by a Justice of Peace, or
a Magistrate of the burgh, “or by one or other of the con∣stables
or other peace-officers of the said county or burgh,
having power to make such requisition.” But instead of
adopting the several parts of this alternative, the interlo∣cutor
studiously avoids it, and employs a general phrase,
“and being required by a Justice of Peace, Magistrate, or
others empowered to that effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. 1720.</NOTE> by act of Parliament 1st
of George I.” which leaves the matter at large.</P>
<P>To authorise the making of proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumult, without selonious Act, is Ground of Pro∣clamation.</NOTE> it is not ne∣cessary
that the meeting have proceeded to any felonious
attack upon property or person; such as wounding, fire∣raising,
or breaking into houses. If the persons be unlawful∣ly,
riotously, and tumultuously assembled; that is to say, with
such circumstances of force, agitation, and disorder, as are
alarming to the lieges, and amount to a disturbance of the pub∣lic
peace; this, in terms of the statute, is a sufficient ground
for the Magistrate to interpose, and command the offenders
to disperse. Which warning if they despise; and if at the end
of an hour they are found to be still assembled in the same tu∣multuous
fashion; they are then guilty of that complete of∣fence
which the statute punishes with death, though no at∣tempt
have ensued to commit any felonious outrage. As on
the other side it is equally certain, that if the rioters pro∣ceed
to any invasion of property or person; then, without re∣gard
to the expiration of an hour, or any other space of time,
and though no proclamation have been made, the offenders
therein are not only liable to be punished for those violences
upon trial, but also to be forcibly resisted, suppressed, and
taken on the spot, either by the Magistrate or by the indivi∣duals
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
invaded, and their assistants, according to the known
tenor and permission of the common law for such cases; to
which cases this enactment relateth not. The law was in
particular explained in this manner by Lord Chief Justice
Loughborough, on occasion of the trials for the great riots
in the metropolis, in 1780.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must the Pannel be proved to have been pre∣sent at the Pro∣clamation.</NOTE> in order to convict any one of this new and insti∣tuted
felony, is it sufficient that he is found in the tumul∣tuous
meeting at the expiration of the hour; or must he be
proved to have been present at the time of making the pro∣clamation?
No case has yet happened to require a deci∣sion
of this point; but the leading consideration with re∣spect
to it seems to be this, that the felony created by the
statute lies in the rebellious and obstinate purpose of the
meeting,—their wilful and deliberate contempt of the law∣ful
warning to disperse. Now, though in most other cases
of criminal proceeding, the ouvert act which is going on,
carries full information with it to all who are present,
of the nature, extent, and consequences of the guilt; it is
quite otherwise in this instance, where, though the crime
be only then capital when proclamation has been made
and the hour has expired, yet the aspect of the assembly is
the same to any one who joins it, whether these aggravating
circumstances exist or not. It cannot therefore justly be pre∣sumed
against any one, who is not shown to have been present
when the proclamation was made, that he is in the know∣ledge
of that monition; and thus, though he be one of a
meeting, which, taken complexly, is involved in the guilt
of a capital felony, yet he may not be personally art
and part thereof; because not participant of that mutinous
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
resolution, wherein lies their guilt, and the one reason and
justisication of the enactment.</P>
<P>THIS favourable construction to the pannel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if he be duly warned that it was made.</NOTE> cannot, how∣ever,
be reasonably carried any greater length. Though he
was not present at the time of proclamation; yet if on join∣ing
the assembly he is duly informed of that matter; as for
instance if he insult a Magistrate or constable, and is then
told that half an hour before proclamation was made in
terms of the act; certainly, in failing to depart upon this
warning, he becomes a member of the felonious assembly;
and associates himself, not to their company only, but to
their progressive state of guilt and danger, as at the time of
his joining them, and is thence forward in the same case with
those who have all along been in the meeting: so that by
continuing with them for half an hour more, he is equal∣ly
guilty as they of the capital offence. If he only join the
assembly after the hour is out, and is then duly informed
of the situation of things; in this case too he is involved
in the same guilt, if he shall not depart forthwith.</P>
<P>WITH respect to those persons who are present at the time of
making proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All present are presumed to hear Proclama∣tion.</NOTE> these things seem to be no less clear:
that they shall all be presumed to hear and understand it;
and that if they are found in the assembly after the hour,
this shall be quite the same as if they were proved, (which
is scarcely possible), to have continued in it constantly. As
also, it is indisputable in regard to those who have recently
joined the multitude, and whether they be in the knowledge
of the proclamation or not, that they must run the risk of
any force which the Magistrate shall employ to suppress the
<PB N="270" REF="271"/>
tumult. For, beside this good reason, that it is impossible
for the Magistrate to distinguish the case of individuals on
such an occasion, truly the man sussers no sort of hard∣ship
in this construction; knowing, as he ought to do, that
the Magistrate may lawfully make use of all means for dis∣persing
and seising rioters, and that to resist or hinder him
therein, is at the peril of the opposer's life, by the rules of
common law.</P>
<P>BUT how shall the case stand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Pro∣clamation be ob∣structed.</NOTE> if, as may happen, the rioters
shall violently hinder the proclamation from being made? This
danger the Legislature have provided for by an additional
clause of the statute; in terms whereof, such let or hinder∣ance<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">By the words of this clause, it may perhaps seem to be intended, that even to obstruct or oppose the Magistrate in making the proclamation, shall be a capital felony, albeit the proclamation should be made, if such opposition is with force and arms.</NOTE> of the Magistrate, who has begun, or is about to pro∣claim,
is itself made an instant, distinct, and capital felo∣ny.
Not, however, in all who are present, but in those only
who are “offenders therein;” that is to say, who are parti∣cipant
of the let or hinderance; which will be judged of by
the ordinary rules of art and part. Farther, by the same
clause, the continuing riotously assembled to the number of
twelve, for the space of an hour <HI>after such let or hinder∣ance
so made,</HI> is a capital felony in the persons so continuing,
“and having knowledge of such let or hinderance so made.”
Under these words, information of the fact, without pre∣sence
at the obstruction, will, therefore, expose any one who
joins and continues in the meeting, to be convicted upon
this part of the statute. There has not been any instance of
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
conviction in any Scots court upon either of these clauses;
but they were libelled, and relevancy was found on them,
in the case of Andrew Fairney, &amp;c. July 18. and 25. 1720;
and that of John Fraser, July 26. 1784.</P>
<P>I SHALL add a few words concerning that other clause of this
act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clause as to Use of Force against the Rioters.</NOTE> which empowers the Magistrate and peace-officers, and
all whom they shall call to their assistance, to disperse,
seize, and apprehend the persons who thus continue riotous∣ly
assembled, to the number of twelve, for an hour after pro∣clamation,
and declares, that if in the course of these mea∣sures,
any of these persons shall be killed, maimed or hurt,
“by reason of their resisting the persons so dispersing, seizing
or apprehending, or endeavouring to disperse, seize or ap∣prehend
them, that then every such Justice of the Peace,
Sheriff, Under Sheriff, Mayor, Bailisf, head-officer, high
or petty constable, or other peace officer, and all and sin∣gular
persons being aiding or assisting to them, or any of
them, shall be free, discharged and indemnified, as well
against the King's Majesty, his heirs and successors, as
against all and every other persons, of, for, or concern∣ing
the killing, maiming or hurting of any such person or
persons,” &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS clause is copied after the statutes above mentioned of
Mary and Elisabeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Construction of this clause. 1. Mary, Sta∣tute 2. c. 12.; 1. Elisabeth, c. 16.</NOTE> The statute 3d and 4th Edw. VI. c. 5.
according to Hale's account of it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Pl. Cr. v. i. p. 53. 293. 294.</NOTE>, contained the like provi∣sion
with respect to the killing of the rioters, for barely conti∣nuing
together, and not returning to their homes after procla∣mation
to disperse. But this, which perhaps could only be justi∣sied
upon the authority of an express law, the act of George has
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
not allowed. And as to that which it has allowed, and which
is only to use the necessary force towards the suppressing, ta∣king,
and dispersing of the rioters, in case they continue
their disorderly proceedings, and resist or make head against
the Magistrate in his efforts to quell the tumult; truly this
is no more, (and in this opinion all the English authorities
are agreed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, Vol. i. p. 53. 293. 495.; Hawkins, vol. i. p. 158. 159. No. 11.: Foster, p. 270. No. 2.; Blackstone, b. 4. c. 11.</NOTE>), than a declaration of the power which the
common law attributes to every Magistrate for the preserva∣tion
of the peace, and which, if it had not been bestowed
in this statute, could not have been understood to be with∣held.
In virtue of his office, the Magistrate has always
had right to command the assistance of all the lieges, who
are of age and ability, to suppress and secure the offen∣ders
in any tumult; wherein, if they oppose him, and will
not desist, nor suffer themselves to be taken, it has al∣ways
been at their own peril, and not imputable to the
Magistrate; provided he be temperate in his proceedings,
and use his privilege with due humanity and discretion. In
this point, the statute has in truth made no addition to
the law; farther than as by aggravating the character of the
tumult into a capital felony, it has made the call the strong∣er
upon the Magistrate to suppress it, and has pointed out a
certain season in the progress of the disorder, as peculiarly
proper for his exertions to that end. In like manner, as al∣ready
hinted, if the assembly are not only tumultuous, but
proceed to violence against property or person; in this si∣tuation
also, without any regard to the hour, whether it has
expired or not, or even to the circumstance of proclama∣tion
having been made; the force may instantly be repel∣led
<PB N="273" REF="274"/>
with force, on the part either of the individual for him∣self,
or of the Magistrate in aid of him; who has not only
power, but is in duty bound, to levy a sufficient <HI>posse</HI> for his
defence. For, though such a notion may have gone abroad
among the ignorant, it is not to be imagined, that the ope∣ration
of this statute, intended as it was in supplement to
the common law, can be to disarm in effect and unnerve the
Magistrate, during a space of time which is sufficient for the
perpetration of the most outrageous excesses.</P>

in the proceedings of the inferior courts,
which have the ordinary cognisance of such disturbances,
the name of riot is also given to a mere brawl, or occasional
quarrel and fighting, among persons who were not assembled
with any purpose of mischief to others. If, however, a con∣test
of this sort happens in such a place, or is carried to such
a length, as to disturb and alarm the neighbourhood, this
seems to be cognisable at instance of the public prosecutor,
as a breach of the public peace; to the effect at least of in∣flicting
fine and imprisonment, and exacting caution from
the offenders, for their good behaviour for some time to
come.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276"/>
II. I had occasion to mention formerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">THREATENING LETTER.</NOTE> by connection
with the crime of fire-raising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sending of In∣cendiary Letter punishable.</NOTE> that the law takes cognisance
not only of an attempt, but even of a threatening to raise
sire, and though made in form of words only; which may
be the mere passionate effusion of ill-temper at the moment.
Much more, therefore, will it pay regard to denunciations
of this or any other the like atrocious mischief, when reduced
to the more serious and deliberate form of writing, or incen∣diary
letter (as it is often called), addressed and conveyed to
the person who is the object of this malicious contrivance.
Even in the case, which is the least formidable, of such a
letter being signed with the real name of the writer, our
Judges have thought such an attempt not undeserving of
the punishment of transportation; as tending to deprive the
person to whom it is addressed of that peace of mind, and
opinion of security, which are among the chief benefits of
the state of civil union. John Fraser was tried upon a
charge of this kind, in March 1759. He had, at different
periods, written letters to John Shand, his brother-in-law,
all of them in his ordinary hand, and signed with his own
name, and threatening Shand with all sorts of mischief, if
his demands of money were not complied with; in which
course being successful for a time, he was encouraged to
make farther requisitions. He was found guilty, and was
adjudged to be transported for seven years.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mode of the same offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extorting of Money by In∣cendiary Letter, is not Robbery.</NOTE> and more likely to
be resorted to by ill-disposed persons, both as safer for
themselves, and more effectual for their purpose, whether
this be to indulge malice, or to profit the offender, is
the sending of anonymous letters, or letters signed with
fictitious names, and threatening harm to person or pro∣perty,
<PB N="276" REF="277"/>
by fire or other violence, unless something shall be
done, or shall be desisted from, which is mentioned in the
letter. Even in the case of this practice having had com∣plete
success in the eliciting of money, it cannot indeed
be construed into a robbery or capital offence. On the one
part, the contriver of this device does not show the same
hardy and resolute wickedness as the robber: On the con∣trary,
he, in the whole scheme, shows a fear of any per∣sonal
rencounter, and purposely avoids to put the object of
his attempt in that instant hazard of death or bodily harm,
or to bring things to that dangerous issue of a personal
struggle, which are the just reasons for punishing robbery
with death. On the other part, the sufferer is himself in
some measure accessory to the completion of the crime
against him; being worked upon to yield up his money
through a vague apprehension of mischief, which though
natural, and in some instances excusable, is however exces∣sive,
and is indeed, in some measure, a breach of that due re∣gard
which he owes to the public. For, instead of recur∣ring
to the Magistrate, and to his neighbour for protection,
such a person deliberately chuses to abandon that social
safeguard; and submits himself to the dominion of a russian,
who thus intermeddles with his property, in some measure
with his own consent, and upon a sort of contract of ransom
between them upon the matter.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against sending threaten∣ing Letters.</NOTE> though it cannot be reduced under the de∣scription
of robbery, it is a wicked attempt against the peace
of the individual; who is kept in dread of some great
evil, which he cannot fully guard against, from an un∣certain
hand. It is also a practice of the most dangerous
example, as tending to lay the orderly and industrious part
<PB N="277" REF="278"/>
of the community, and especially its Magistrates and pub∣lic
officers, under contribution to the licentious and prosli∣gate.
In certain parts of the neighbouring kingdom, prac∣tices
of this kind had, at one time, arrived at such a pitch of
frequency, as to require the special interposition of the Legis∣lature,
in aid of their common law. The act of the 9th
George I. c. 22. proceeds upon the narrative, that ill-de∣signing
persons had of late associated under the name of
<HI>Blacks,</HI> who went about armed, and with their faces blacked,
and doing all manner of mischief; and who were in use to
send letters under fictitious names, making demand of veni∣son,
money, and other things, and threatening great vio∣lence
if such their orders should not be complied with,
or if they should be hindered or molested in their law∣less
proceedings. Wherefore it enacts, that whoever “shall
knowingly send any letter without any name subscribed
thereto, or signed with a fictitious name, demanding mo∣ney,
venison, or other valuable thing,” shall be adjud∣ged
guilty of felony, and suffer death without benefit of
clergy.</P>
<P>THE act of the 27th George II. c. 15.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against sending threaten∣ing Letter.</NOTE> was meant as a sup∣plement
to the former; and appointed the same pains for
any person who should send a letter not signed, or signed
with a fictitious name, and threatening death or fire-raising,
“though no money, or venison, or other valuable thing be
demanded in or by such letter:” Which sort of address
might indeed be thought to be the more distressing of the
two, as leaving no way of compliance open, to avert the
threatened evil.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do they extend to Scotland?</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT as the first of these laws was made for the suppression
of local and temporary disorders in a certain quarter of
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
England; so in the case of James Gray, where this matter
underwent a full discussion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27. and July 11. 1737.</NOTE> it was virtually found not to ex∣tend
to this part of the united kingdoms; the libel being
only sustained to infer an arbitrary punishment. Though
the same judgment has not yet been given, it may probably
be expected with respect also to the latter statute, which has
reference to the first, and is calculated (as the title bears)
to explain and amend it. The charge was in part laid
on it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29. 1781.</NOTE> in the case of Thomas Gemmell; but it was judged
prudent in the end to abandon the statute, and restrict the
conclusion to such an arbitrary punishment as might be ob∣tained
at common law.</P>
<P>THE truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of this Crime at Com∣mon Law.</NOTE> that we have little reason to regret the limi∣tation
of these statutes to the other quarter of the kingdom;
because our common law has native vigour sufficent to pu∣nish
this enormity in a manner which the common law of
England would not have authorised; and which is fully equal
to what the urgency of the evil in this country has at any
time required. As appears from the aforesaid case of James
Gray, who, being convicted of writing anonymous letters to
several persons, threatening all sort of violence, if a purse of
money were not laid for him in a certain place, was adjudged
to stand in the pillory, and to be transported for life. This,
and the case of Fraser already quoted, in which also the pannel
had sentences of transportation, are, as far as I have seen, the
only instances of judgment for this sort of offence. But the
charge has been found relevant in sundry other cases.</P>
<P>IT was one accusation among others against William Gil∣christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1741.</NOTE>
that he had written two letters to a certain dealer in
corn, threatening him with fire and violence, unless he
should bring forth his grain, and sell it at a low rate; or if
<PB N="279" REF="280"/>
he should inquire about the persons who had broken into and
plundered his mill. And in that case, the “libel and several
articles thereof,” were found relevant to infer the pains
of law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 17. &amp; 18. 1761.</NOTE> In like manner, John Edwards was accused of wri∣ting
an anonymous letter to Johnston of Straiton, threaten∣ing
to kill or rob him, unless he should put L. 50 under a
certain stone, at such a time when the writer might find it.
The libel was found relevant to infer the pains of law, and
the prosecutor restricted his conclusions to an arbitrary pu∣nishment;
but the jury found a verdict for the pannel.
The like restriction had been made, and the like verdict
was returned, in the case already mentioned, of Thomas
Gemmell, who was charged as author of sundry anonymous
letters to a certain gentleman, threatening to kill him,
or to destroy his property with fire. Much about the same
time, this gentleman had received another letter, of simi∣lar
contents, and concluding with this device, by way of
subscription, <HI>Ask about is my name.</HI> William Rennie fell under
the suspicion of being the author of this composition, and
was <HI>fugitate</HI> upon a charge to that effect, February 5. 1781.</P>
<P>THIS is an offence which seems to be of modern invention,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scopelismus</HI> of the Roman Law.</NOTE>
and has nothing analogous to it in the Roman law; unless it
be the crime of <HI>Scopelismus</HI> (as it was called), which was pe∣culiar
to the province of Arabia, and is described in these
terms:<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. 9. <HI>Dig. de extraord. Crim.</HI></NOTE> “Plerique solent praedium inimici scopelizein;
id est, lapides ponere, indicio futures, quod si quis eum
agrum coluisset, malo letho periturus esset insidiis eorum
qui scopulos posuissent; quae res tantum timoris habet, ut
nemo ad eum agrum accedere audeat, crudelitatem timens
eorum qui scopelismon fecerunt.”</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="281"/>
THE offenders were liable to be severely chastised, ac∣cording
to the custom of the province, “usque ad paenam
capitis, quia et ipsa res mortem comminatur.”</P>
<P>III. IT has been held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verbal Threats of Mischief, are Punishable.</NOTE> that even the verbal threatening of
personal mischief, if it be violent and pointed, is relevant,
as a reasonable ground of alarm, both to the individual and
the public, for obliging the offender to find caution to keep
the complainer free of harm. And this is a distinct expe∣dient
from that of caution in law-borrows; which any per∣son
may obtain summarily, from any Magistrate, upon his
own oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593, c. 170.</NOTE> without the help of other evidence, but only under
such penalties as have been appointed by the statute in that
behalf. Whereas, in the case of him who is convicted of
threats upon indictment and evidence, the caution may be
ordered under such penalties, as the Court, in the circum∣stances
of the case, shall see cause to appoint. Mackenzie has
said so, in his Observations on the 5th stat. 1st Parliament,
James III.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Obs. on the Statutes, p. 59.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 24. 1712.</NOTE> and interlocutor was given to that effect in the
trial of Captain Andrew Nairne, at instance of Mrs Jean
Leslie, James Baird, and the Lord Advocate, for threats
of death and mischief<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the libel as libelled, relevant to infer the pannel's being obliged to find caution for keeping the said Mrs. J. Lesly and James Baird, pur∣suers, harmless and skaithless, <HI>and that under the pain of such a sum of money, as the Lords should find just and modify.</HI>”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IV. IN this place I shall also treat briefly of the offence of
sending a chal∣lenge to fight a duel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Duels and Challenges.</NOTE> or single combat; this
<PB N="281" REF="282"/>
being a crime which has a direct tendency to occasion a
breach of the peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">DUEL, &amp;c.</NOTE> We have already seen, that where a
duel takes place upon a challenge, and is followed with the
death of one of the parties, this, according to the law of
Scotland, is murder in the surviver, how fair and equal soever
the manner of conducting the combat. But, the better to
repress such irregularities, to which the servent temper of
the Scots so strongly disposed them, the Legislature, by the
statute 1600, c. 12. raised the bare act of engaging in a duel,
to the same rank of a capital crime as the actual slaughter;
without distinguishing whether any of the parties did or did
not suffer any wound or material harm on the occasion. To
complete the restraint; it was, by statute 1696, c. 35. made
punishable with banishment and escheat of moveables, to be
concerned in the giving, sending, or accepting of a chal∣lenge;
even though no combat should ensue.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is to be held a Chal∣lenge.</NOTE> however, is a rigorous law, upon which indictment
will not lie, but in the case of a direct and deliberate de∣fiance
to fight; a proposal to that effect, seriously and expli∣citly
given, and if not attended with all the observances
that are often used on such occasions, at least definite and re∣gular
in a certain degree; so as to exclude on the one hand,
all ambiguous hints or innuendos, and on the other, all
scornful taunts, or sudden and passionate words of defiance,
(<HI>verba jactantia),</HI> uttered face to face, and only tending to a
challenge, but not the very proposal and adjustment of a
combat. In that view, judgment was given dismissing one ar∣ticle
of the charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5. &amp; 9. 1719.</NOTE> in the libel at instance of William Alves
against William Irving of Gribtoun; which bore, among
other matters, that in the course of a scuffle with the prose∣cutor,
his wife and servants, Irving, beside other abuse, desired
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
Alves to get a sword, and give him satisfaction<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And as to that article of the libel, which concerns the pannel's giving a challenge to the said Alexander Alves to fight, the said Lords finds the same as libelled, not relevant to infer the pains of the act of Parliament against duel∣ling.”</NOTE>. In the
prior case of James Maccall, merchant in Leith, indicted
at instance of Basset Eids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 5. 1714.</NOTE> land-surveyor there, the Court
had, however, sustained a charge to this effect; that Maccall,
having thrown out a personal defiance to Eids to sight, and
threatened to affront him wherever they should again meet,
he early next morning left a verbal message for him with his
servant, at his house in Leith, bearing that he should wait for
Eids upon the beach, and have satisfaction from him for what
had passed the day before. The challenge had been much of
the same sort, in another case, and the only one, as far as I can
find, where a prosecution on the statute has been attended
with success; the case of David Cairns, (brother to the Laird
of Torr), tried at Dumfries before Lord Bowhill, on the 1st
and 2d of May 1712. It appears from the proof, that the
defiance was given verbally, and by the one party in the
personal presence of the other; but in direct and plain terms,
and with mention of time and place, though accompanied
with soul and opprobrious epithets. The Judge found the
libel relevant to infer the statutory pains<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>Macdouall for the pannel, alleges, that as to that point of the indictment, anent giving of a challenge, the same is not relevant, seeing there was no written challenge given; and what was spoke by the pannel anent a challenge, was when he was in drink, and no fighting ensued.</P>
<P><HI>Interlocutor.</HI> “And finds that point of the libel, as to the pannel's giving a challenge, relevant to infer the pains contained in the 35th Act, last Session of King William's Parliament, and remits,” &amp;c.</P></NOTE>; and the pan∣nel
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>
being convicted, had sentence of escheat of moveables,
and of banishment from Scotland, for the space of seven
years. It was objected, in the first of these cases, that there
was no mention of mortal weapons, nor any express appeal
to sight <HI>a duel of single combat;</HI> but this plea was over-ruled<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“They find the said James Maccall, pannel, his having, about the time li∣belled, challenged the said Basset Eids to sight, relevant to infer the pains li∣belled.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE found in the record but one libel more upon the act
of William; that at instance of Alexander Brown, merchant
in Edinburgh, against William Alexander, of the same place
and profession.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. &amp; 16. 1757.</NOTE> After some account of a disagreement be∣tween
the parties, it relates that Alexander, being alone with
Brown, in a room adjoining to a public coffee-room, sudden∣ly
pulled out a pistol, and held it towards him, and demand∣ed
satisfaction; and that another pistol was found in his
pocket, but neither of them loaded. The charge was there∣fore
laid, not only upon the foresaid act, for the statu∣tory
penalties, but also at common law for damages, as for
an assault and putting in fear. It was found relevant in ge∣neral
to infer the pains of law, damages and expences; but
in the end the prosecutor passed from his conclusions on the
statute. The jury found, “That the pannel did, at the time
and place libelled, assault Alexander Brown the complainer
with a pistol, with a view, as he said, to procure satisfaction
from him for an injury the pannel supposed the complain∣er
had done to him.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 18. &amp; 21.</NOTE> Alexander had sentence to pay
a fine of 1000 merks, and L. 68: 6: 11 of expences.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285"/>
V. I SHALL conclude this Chapter with a few words as to
the bearing of mortal weapons upon the person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bearing of Fire-arms; Laws against it.</NOTE> a practice
which our Legislature have regarded as a preparation for vio∣lence,
and the sign of an evil and quarrelsome disposition. The
earliest restraint of the freedom of the lieges in this particu∣lar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567, c. 18.</NOTE>
is by a statute of James VI. which was made on occa∣sion
of certain outrages committed in Edinburgh; and is ge∣neral
with respect to the persons who are forbidden, but is
only directed against the using or bearing of <HI>fire-arms,</HI> as
those with which mischief may most suddenly be done,
and which chiefly exclude the common means of defence,
by superior courage or activity. By this law, the punish∣ment
of using or bearing fire-arms, is the loss of the right
hand;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597, c. 252.</NOTE> to which an after law, superadds the escheat of move∣ables.
Probably, the great severity of these pains, and the
bent of the manners of the time, had proved an obstacle to
the execution of this measure of police. At least this may
be conjectured from the style of the next law on the subject,
the act 1600, c. 6.; which complains, in the preamble, of
the difficulty of convicting offenders in the ordinary way of
trial, by an assize, and upon the testimony of witnesses; and
therefore bestows a jurisdiction on the Privy Council in this
matter, with a power of trial by oath of party; but only to
the effect of inslicting a fine, or escheat of moveables, or ward∣ing
of the person. According to Mackenzie, it authorises
the Justice Court also to proceed in the same form; but
as such a course of trial is in derogation of the common
rule, so this opinion seems to be contrary to a just con∣struction
of the statute.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that any of these laws was ever put to ve∣ry
strict or rigorous execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of this Crime.</NOTE> In some instances, such as that
<PB N="285" REF="286"/>
of William Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">UNLAWFUL WEAPONS.</NOTE> the Court referred the punishment to the
decision of King and Council. Very often the pannel came
in the King's will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1620.</NOTE> and was dismissed with a slight censure.
And sometimes, for aught that appears, the conviction was
not followed with any sentence at all; as in the case of Sir
Henry Lindsay, in February 1603; and of William Max∣well
of Cowhill, August 6. 1605. In short, no instance is
to be found of a person condemned to lose his hand for using
or bearing fire-arms, unless that offence were coupled to an
act of slaughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2. 1602.</NOTE> or other capital crime. Thus, Alexander
Rowan had sentence of death, on conviction of bearing fire∣arms,
and of theft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. 1608.</NOTE> and Elliot, on conviction of the same
offence, and of slaughter. It is true, that on 18th August
1603, George Turnbull, for bearing and using fire-arms, was
adjudged to lose his hand; but he was at the same time
charged with three acts of slaughter; of one of which he
emitted a confession, qualified only with this unfavourable,
though at that time lawful defence, that the person killed was
at the horn.</P>
<P>IT farther appears, that as early as Mackenzie's own time,
(who indeed remarks, that the bearing of arms was more
commonly libelled as an aggravation, than a crime), these
statutes were tending to go into disuse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24. 1673.</NOTE> In the trial of John
Nicolson for murder, it was stated in defence, that he was
fowler to a landed man, and as such carried a gun; and that
being abused by the deceased at a mill, where he had called
for food to his dogs upon his way, his piece discharged in
the struggle, and thus the man was killed. The prosecutor
answered, that the bearing of fire-arms, either for fowling
or otherwise, was itself a crime, and could be of no service
to his cause. But the Court sustained both the charge and
the defence.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287"/>
WITH regard to the keeping of arms in a person's habita∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keeping of Fire-arms.</NOTE>
for the defence thereof,—this was never doubted at any
period to be lawful; though by the statutes, 1. George I.
c. 54.; 19. George II. c. 39.; and 26. George II. c. 29. it
was for a time forbidden, or laid under restrictions, with
respect to certain parts of the country, which were suspected
of disaffection to the family upon the Throne.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF INCEST.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the example of Judge Blackstone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVIII.</NOTE> I shall refer
to one class all those offences, though in other respects
of very various descriptions, which are against the public
<HI>Police</HI> and <HI>Oeconomy.</HI> Meaning by this, (says that judicious
and elegant writer), “the due regulation and domestic order
of the kingdom: whereby the individuals of the State,
like members of a well governed family, are bound to
conform their general behaviour to the rules of propriety,
good neighbourhood, and good manners, and to be de∣cent,
industrious, and inoffensive, in their respective situ∣ations.”</P>
<P>ONE of the most important branches of this internal oeco∣nomy,
is that which has relation to the intercourse of the
sexes: For upon the due regulation of this connection
depend many of those habits, dispositions, and affections,
which are alike essential to the happiness of the indivi∣dual,
and to the health and prosperity of the State. Let us
<PB N="288" REF="289"/>
therefore attend to the several offences, which are violations
of the duty of a decent and well disposed citizen in that
respect.</P>
<P>AND first of Incest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incest; why punishable.</NOTE> or the crime of carnal knowledge be∣tween
persons who are near of kin. Which sort of inter∣course,
as in a greater or less extent it has been forbidden
by the general custom of all communities, and even of times
very little advanced in civilization; so must it no less be
ascribed to the native feelings of the human constitution,
than to those obvious views of policy and discipline, which
recommend the enforcing of such a restraint.</P>
<P>WITH regard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prohibition in the Catholic times.</NOTE> however, to the precise extent of the in∣junction;
if we except those very near relations whom na∣ture
itself has filled with mutual sentiments of a more pure
and severe affection, and has made repugnant to the very no∣tion
of each other as objects of desire; it will in some measure
be affected, in different countries, by their situation of so∣ciety,
and the other circumstances of their state of man∣ners
and institutions. With us in Scotland, and in the times
of Popery, this matter, like some others of the same class,
seems chiefly to have been viewed in the light of a sin, or
offence against religion; which fell, therefore, to be chasti∣sed
with the weapons of spiritual censure. And hence, part∣ly
owing to the superstition of the age, and partly to other
motives, less honourable than profitable to the church, the re∣straint
was carried to a far greater length, than any reason
of either policy or morality required: In so much, that all
<PB N="289" REF="290"/>
marriage in the fourth degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">INCEST.</NOTE> (by the canonical computa∣tion),
either of consanguinity of affinity<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Denuntient etiam presbyteri parochianis suis, quod matrimonium prohibi∣tum est infra quartum gradum consangumitatis vel affinitatis; ultra quartum gradum legitime contrahitur.” Canons of Scots Provincial Councils, A. D. 1242, and 1269, Art. 65.</NOTE>, was forbidden.</P>
<P>UPON the Reformation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes con∣cerning Incest.</NOTE> this, as in practice it must have
proved, very troublesome abuse, was among the first to be cor∣rected.
By the statute 1567, c. 15. “the halie band of mar∣riage”
was declared “to be as lawful and as frie as the
lawe of God hes permitted the samin to be done;” and by
another statute of the same year, c. 14. entitled, “Anent
them that committis incest,” this offence is limited to those
“that abuses their bodie with sik persones in degrie, as God
in his word hes expresslie forbidden, as is contained in
the 18th chapter of Leviticus.” But withall, as the man∣ners
of those times were not a little turned towards se∣verity,
with respect to all sinful or irregular indulgence in
pleasure, and more especially in what related to the inter∣courses
of the sexes; so, while the description of the offence
was retrenched to a more reasonable measure than formerly,
the punishment was carried to the greatest height, and was
declared by the same law to be the punishment of death.</P>
<P>IN treating of this crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to be con∣strued.</NOTE> our chief inquiry will be con∣cerning
the degrees of relation, which are the object of the
statutory pains; a matter, though of some importance, which
is not perhaps, so clear in every article, as might be wished.
In the entrance, I would venture to suggest, that the just con∣struction
of these two statutes, intended as they may have
<PB N="290" REF="291"/>
been, and probably were, to establish one rule for the two
matters of incest and unlawful marriage, in themselves so
nearly connected, may not however in all points be the
same; because of the different nature of the objects of
their enactment. The provisions of the one, as regulating
a pure civil interest, may, perhaps, with respect to cer∣tain
omitted articles and degrees of relation, admit of a
broad and liberal interpretation, according to the analogy
of what is expressed in the text; especially if such a con∣struction
is sanctified by the opinion, and the custom of
observance of the inhabitants of the land. Or, at least, these
may be called in to settle the meaning of any doubtful pas∣sage,
and they may settle it for the restraining sense; being,
(which is certainly true), the favourable sense to order and
morality, and attended too, (as in these circumstances it
would be), with little reason for complaint of hardship.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes; how to be construed.</NOTE> that the same liberty shall be equally warrant∣able
in the construction of a penal statute like the other, by
which a certain act is for the first time raised to the rank
of a capital offence; this is a far more doubtful position.
Many have rather thought, that the one consideration in the
decision of those high interests of life and death shall be,
<HI>what hath the statute said;</HI> and that neither custom, nor
analogy, nor inference of the purpose of the Legislature, has
here any just claim to be regarded. How rigorous soever the
enactment; as far as it is clear and positive, it must be
obeyed. But in any point that is ambiguous or equivocal,
a strict and literal construction to the side of mercy, may
seem to be the only proper one to be applied to it. And as
to any blunder or defect of the statute, whereby the offend∣er's
<PB N="291" REF="292"/>
life may be saved; this (as it may here be esteemed)
not unfortunate omission, must not even out of deference to
erroneous precedents of judgment, and far less to popular in∣clination
or belief, or from any regard to the regularity and
beauty of the law, be corrected or supplied. At farthest;
if any exception is to be admitted to this rule, it can only
be of those cases in which the connection is forbidden by the
law of nature, and the universal custom of all nations; and
which for this reason only were not set down in words by
the Legislature, that they were taken for granted, or were
held to be included in the broader sense of the general terms
made use of in the statute, or were too unnatural to be ima∣gined.</P>
<P><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It may also be observed, that the expressions of the two statutes are not the same. The statute concerning marriage “declares, That secunds in degrees of consanguinity and affinity, and all degrees out with the samin, contained in the word of the eternal God, <HI>and that are not repugnant to the said word,</HI> might, and may lawfully marry.” The other relates only to those “who abuses their body with sic persons in degree, as God in his word, <HI>has expressly for∣bidden.</HI>” Perhaps the expressions of the one, may be thought to admit a lati∣tude of construction, which is excluded by those of the other.</NOTE> THERE is another circumstance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes; how to be construed.</NOTE> which may be thought
the more to recommend this rule of judgment in the pre∣sent
instance. The Legislature, at one time, had them∣selves
remarked the imperfections of the statute concerning
incest, and thought it necessary to supply them by farther
and more particular provisions. The statute 1649, c. 16.
proceeds upon the narrative of the act of James having omit∣ted
“many other degrees of incest, both in assinity and con∣sanguinity,
no less heinous and punishable than those ex∣pressed
in the letter of that text, because they be either
nearer or fully as near.” And it therefore extends the
<PB N="292" REF="293"/>
appellation of incest, and applies the pains of death to all
cases of that description, as contained in a table which is
subjoined to the act. This statute fell under the general
act recissory of the Usurper's laws; whereby we are now
again referred to the Levitical law, as our sole warrant and
direction; and thus there arises even a stronger argument
for a strict adherence to the words of that text, how defec∣tive
soever they may be found, than if no such supplemen∣tary
provision had ever been thought necessary to be made.</P>
<P>LET us therefore inquire how far the prohibitions of the
18th chapter of Leviticus extend.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prohibitions among <HI>Consan∣guinei.</HI></NOTE> And first of <HI>consanguinei,</HI>
or relations by blood.</P>
<P>1. IN the direct line of relation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the direct Line.</NOTE> the parent is forbidden
to know the child, (v. 7.), or the grandfather to know the
granddaughter, (v. 10.); and there is no farther express
prohibition. But it has been doubted, whether the other
modes and more remote degrees of the direct relation, all
of which have equally the sanction of nature and of uni∣versal
custom on their side, may not be held to be included
under the terms of <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter, Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI>
which are perhaps employed in the text, in their broad and
looser acceptation.</P>
<P>2. AMONG the collateral relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collaterals: Brother and Sister.</NOTE> there is an express pro∣hibition
to sister and brother, whether uterine or consangui∣nean,
(v. 11. 9.). The statute was accordingly applied to
such a case, within a few years after its date: for on the
2d February 1570, James and Agnes Bonnar, brother and
sister, were convicted of incest and adultery, and had doom
to be burnt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. 1641. Jan. 28. 1642.</NOTE> Andrew Bannock also had sentence of death
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
for incest with his sister Margaret. And for this crime it
was, that Jean Weir, the sister of the noted Major Weir,
was convicted and suffered death, in April 1670.</P>
<P>A NEPHEW,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncle and Niece, Aunt and Ne∣phew.</NOTE> likewise, is forbidden to know his aunt, (v. 12.
13.) whether by father or mother's side. And as to uncle
and niece, though nothing be expressly said; yet our prac∣tice,
holding the guilt of the two offences, as the degree of the
relation, to be the same, and the prohibition of either to im∣ply
the other, has in more than one instance applied the statu∣tory
pains to this case too; and this equally whether the rela∣tion
were in full or in half blood. On the 8th February 1633,
John Baxter and Helen Sheviz, his niece by his sister uterine
(as I understand the record<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Record calls her “his sister-doghter by the mother's side.”</NOTE>), had sentence of death for
incest. As had James Strang, and Janet Strang, his niece
by his brother german, on the 24th April 1649. This was
before the passing of the act of that year, which would have
reached such a case; and the like judgment was repeated in
later times, after that ordinance had been rescinded. As in

<P>3. As to relations in affinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relations in the direct Line of Affinity.</NOTE> Father and daughter-in-law
are expressly forbidden, (v. 15.); as also, son and step∣mother,
(v. 8.); and father and stepdaughter, (v. 17.); and
by the same passage, the like seems to be true with respect to
the granddaughter of one's wife, begotten either of her son
or daughter. Sentence of death accordingly passed on James
Wilson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 20. 1649.</NOTE> coal-grieve at Bonhard, for incest with his wife's
daughter, committed, (as the record has it), “a threattie-five
year since or thereby.” He had, on the same libel been
convicted of adultery; but with another woman, and not of
a capital nature.</P>
<P>WHEN we come to speak of the collateral relations in af∣finity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collateral Relations in Affinity.</NOTE>
we find more than one case, with respect to which
there is much room for difference of opinion. A brother is
indeed expressly forbidden to know the wife of his brother,
(v. 16.); and to that effect we had an example of conviction
in the case of Catharine Nairne and Patrick Ogilvy, in Au∣gust
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
1765. But whether under the term <HI>wise,</HI> which is employ∣ed
in the text, we are to understand a brother's <HI>widow</HI> also
to be included; or shall conceive the crime to be committed
by knowledge of the woman in the brother's lifetime only;
this is a question which for several reasons, and especially
by reason of a passage in the book of Deuteronomy, (ch. xxv.
v. 5. <HI>et seq.</HI>) which seems rather to enjoin the marriage of her
as a duty, is attended with some difficulty. At one period, this
point inlisted on the one or the other side, the whole Doctors
and theologians of Europe, as relative to the lawfulness of the
marriage between Henry VIII. and Catharine of Arragon,
the widow of his elder brother Arthur. With us, however,
judgment had once, at least, been given upon the rigorous
side; for on the 19th November 1624, and upon a libel which
bore no charge but that of incest, Jeffray Irvine had sen∣tence
to lose his head; having, it appears, begotten four
children on his brother's widow.</P>
<P>THERE is the like ground of scruple with respect to the
sister of one's wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sister by Affini∣ty.</NOTE> whom, in v. 18. one is indeed forbidden
to know, but then only in such terms, “(in her lifetime),”
and for such a reason, “(to vex her<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other, in her lifetime.”</NOTE>),” as occasion some
difficulty of applying the rule to the other case, of inter∣course
with the sister of a wife, after the wife's decease.
Doubts have accordingly been entertained, as well by
divines as by lawyers, concerning the successive marriage
of two sisters, whether it be not even a lawful, and to all
effects sufficient marriage. Our practice affords, however,
one instance, of the pains of incest applied to this situ∣ation
also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 8 &amp; 22. and Mar. 12. 1705.</NOTE> I allude to the case of Barbara Tannahill;
<PB N="296" REF="297"/>
who had sentence of death for incest committed with the
sister of his deceased wise; but on which conviction Lord
Royston has this remark in his notes: “<HI>Sed dubito an jure,</HI>”
“for, since King James's act has an express reference to the
Judaical law, Levit. xviii. it ought not to be extended
to other cases not therein expressly mentioned.”</P>
<P>As to examples of conviction in the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Incest with Sis∣ter by Affinity.</NOTE> and more cer∣tain
mode of the crime, which involves adultery as well as
incest; they have been more numerous, though they are all of
distant date. On the 17th July 1613, James Stewart, for
incest with Catharine Clogie, his wife's sister, who bore him
a child, as appears in the lifetime of his wife, (though the li∣bel
is laid for incest only), was condemned to be hanged, and
his body to be burned at the cross of Edinburgh. Sentence
of death also passed on Henry Dick in Bandrum, indict∣ed
on the statute 1567, c. 14. for the procreation of a child
in incest and adultery, with Mary Douglas, the sister of his
wife. This was on the 19th August 1629; but the Privy
Council, on the 6th April 1630, commuted the sentence
for banishment. I find a third instance of capital con∣viction;
the case of Donald Brymer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17. 1649.</NOTE> who in the lifetime
of his wife Margaret, had a child by Janet Hutchieson her
sister. The libel was laid for the crime of incest only.</P>
<P>NEXT of the more distant collateral relations in affinity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aunt and Ne∣phew by Affini∣ty.</NOTE>
And here the question shall first be stated, as between the wife
and the blood relations of the husband. It is certainly incest,
(by v. 14.) if a woman know her husband's nephew by his
brother; and the charge was accordingly sustained in such
a case, that of Elizabeth Smith and Thomas Hardy, of the
<PB N="297" REF="298"/>
12th November 1705<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The diet in this case was afterwards deserted.</NOTE>. Nay, in the case of John Weir of
Clenachdike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25. 1629.</NOTE> the rule was extended to the marrying of the
<HI>relict of a gudsire's brother,</HI> or grand-aunt, by affinity; for
which transgression this pannel had sentence to be beheaded.
With respect to a nephew by the husband's <HI>sister,</HI> though
certainly in itself such a case stands in the same degree of
guilt as the other, the text of Leviticus has said nothing;
nor have our Courts as yet had any opportunity of consi∣dering
the question.</P>
<P>STATING the question on the other part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncle and Niece by Affinity.</NOTE> with respect to
the husband and the blood-relations of the wife, such as her
niece or her aunt, our text almost entirely fail us; for upon
none of these cases has it either expressly ordered any thing, or
even furnished any clear indication of its purpose. Neverthe∣less,
in two instances the sanction of the statute has been ap∣plied
to this sort of transgression also. One is the case of Alex∣ander
Blair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9. 1630.</NOTE> who was beheaded for incest committed after the
death of his wife, with Catharine Winram, the daughter of
his wife's brother in half blood. The other is the case of
Alexander Gourlay of Southhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 5. 1626.</NOTE> who being indicted for
incest with Euphemia Corstorphine, sister of his wife's mo∣ther,
had his defences repelled, “in respect of the libel, and
act of Parliament whereupon the same is founded<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This pannel had, however, a verdict in his favour.</NOTE>.” But
to these we have to oppose the judgment in the later and
stronger case of Alison Beatson;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 13. &amp; 14. 1692.</NOTE> whereby the indictment
against her, which was laid upon the statute, for incest with
John Nicol, the husband of her mother's sister, and also for
murder of the incestuous issue, was, in the first article,
<PB N="298" REF="299"/>
found relevant only to infer an arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“He maist shamefully gave the use of his body to twa young damoseils, baith being sisters, the ane namit Margarate Henderson, and the other Cath∣rane Henderson, baith his scholars, and young virgins, and thereby committed notour and manifest incest.”</NOTE>. She
was convicted both of the incest and the concealment of
her pregnancy, and escaped with sentence of imprisonment
and transportation.</P>
<P>THE same inclination of our older practice to severity
against offenders of this sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Illicit commerce with two Sisters or Brothers.</NOTE> (but which is rather to be im∣puted
to the general cast of the manners and opinions of
those times, than to any peculiar disposition of the Judges),
may be observed in the following judgments; which pro∣bably
would not be repeated now, if the like cases were
again to happen. On the 2d August 1628, George Sinclair<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the incest as libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment; and that article, that she put violent hands on her child, relevant to in∣fer the pain of death; but find the last part of the libel, anent her concealing her being with child, and not calling for help, &amp;c. only relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>,
a schoolmaster, convicted of carnal intercourse with two sis∣ters,
of the name of Henderson, his pupils, (along with cer∣tain
other, but none of them capital offences), had sentence
to be drowned. On the 2d June 1643, Janet Imbrie was
convicted of lying “and keeping company” (as the record
has it), with John and Andrew Thomson, two brothers; and
was condemned to be beheaded. The case of Jean Knox, of
the 28th of May 1649, was of the same class, but still more
shameful and scandalous: for this woman, being with child by
William Murray, had married and cohabited with his brother.
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
She also had sentence of death. It is to be observed of all
these convictions, that they were prior to the passing of the act
1649, which declared, that an affinity should equally be con∣tracted
“by unlawful company of man and woman as by
marriage.” A fourth instance, which followed after the
repeal of that act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 20. 1669.</NOTE> was the case of Callum Oig Macgregor,
who was charged, among other crimes, with that of incest;
having begotten a child on Elizabeth Macgregor, after se∣veral
children had been born to him, and all of them out of
wedlock, by Christian Macgregor, her sister. The libel
concluded for capital punishment, and was found relevant in
all its articles. The man was convicted (<HI>inter alia</HI>) of the
“filthie and abominable crime of incest;” and had sentence
of death accordingly.</P>
<P>Now, though it could not be disputed, respecting any of these
connections, that they were very gross and shameful immo∣ralities,
and such as deserved the cognisance of a criminal
court; yet it may well be doubted, whether, in any of them,
the offence amounted to the crime of incest, or was sub∣ject
to the statutory pains. The proper notion of that crime,
and which is announced in the text of the law of Moses, (v. 6.)
is the carnal knowledge of those who <HI>are near of kin;</HI> and
in none of these cases, at the time of the facts libelled, was
there any relation between the pannel and either of the
objects of the illicit intercourse. Even in the case of Knox,
which is by far the strongest of them, the crime could not
be made out without taking that into account, which was
committed while as yet the woman had no alliance to either
of the brothers; so that these judgments seem to have pro∣ceeded
on the notion, adopted indeed and made law by the
act 1649, but which in itself seems to be a loose and ground∣less
<PB N="300" REF="301"/>
notion, of some sort of affinity contracted through the
<HI>vaga venus,</HI> or <HI>unlawful company,</HI> (as it is termed in that law),
of man and woman. This opinion may now be given with
the less dissidence, that in the later case of Margaret Pa∣terson,
who was indicted on the statute for incest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1. 1692.</NOTE> as having
been found naked, in bed, with David and James Kennedy,
brothers, the prosecutor thought it proper to depart from
the capital conclusion of his libel. This woman was con∣victed,
and was ordered to stand in the jugs for two hours,
and to be scourged and transported.</P>
<P>ONE question more which relates to this crime, is con∣cerning
the bastard relations, (if such they may be called);
whether these, equally with the relations through lawful
wedlock, are objects of the statutory pains. It cannot indeed
be doubted, that in the first and most certain degree of that
connection, as between the mother and the son, the offence
in itself is of equal enormity, and cannot escape without
some severe chastisement. Yet still, since the law so utterly
disregards this sort of filiation, as to deny the child any of the
privileges or advantages of blood; so there seems to be some
difficulty of subjecting it to a sanction like that in question,
which has only been created by positive statute, beyond what
the law of nature may seem to require. This matter came
to be agitated in the trial of George and Janet Johnston;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1705.</NOTE>
who being indicted for incest, as uncle and niece, maintain∣ed
this defence, that the woman was not the lawful, but
the bastard daughter of the man's brother. The prosecutor
answers, that legitimacy is to be presumed, she being own∣ed
as his daughter; and <HI>esto,</HI> she were his bastard, yet that
<HI>cognation</HI> also is sufficient to infer the crime. The terms of
the interlocutor are ambiguous, and such upon which one
<PB N="301" REF="302"/>
cannot with certainty say<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords found, the pannel's being uncle and niece, their carnal copulation together in the corn-baulk, or his being <HI>nudus cum nuda</HI> in the bed for some time with her, relevant to infer the crime of incest, and the pains libelled; and found the other qualifications, and adultery as libelled, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; and repelled the haill other defences proponed for the pannel.”</NOTE>, whether any judgment was
meant to be given on this point of the debate.</P>
<P>To conclude: It is essential to the guilt of this, as of all
other crimes, that the parties, at the time of their offending,
have been in the knowledge of that circumstance, wherein
lies the criminality of their act; so that either of them,
who was then ignorant of the relation, (if such a thing should
happen), shall be free of all punishment. But that the
ignorance of either, or even of both, shall sustain the legiti∣macy
of the incestuous issue, (as some authorities have
alleged), is an opinion more difficult to be allowed.</P>
<P>IN regard to the proof of the offence. If the party do not
confess, it can scarcely be any other than by circumstances; but
which ought, however, to be conclusive of the actual consum∣mation
of the guilt. For, in this I must differ from Mac∣kenzie,
that I see no good reason, why our practice should
in this instance deviate from its usual lenity, of holding the
mere <HI>conatus</HI> to be a lower offence than the completed act;
as well as that an actual <HI>abuse of the body</HI> seems to be re∣quired
by the very words of the statute 1567.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF ADULTERY.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not very much enlarge upon the next offence of
this class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIX.</NOTE>—Adultery,—which though it keep its place
in our statute-book, as a heinous, and in some cases a capital
crime, has not for many years been the subject of a criminal
prosecution.</P>
<P>YET I think it is hardly to be doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adultery is a Point of Dittay.</NOTE> that our law has done
wisely in placing this high breach of moral and social duty in
the list of crimes, instead of classing it, (which seems to be the
case in England), in the rank of a mere civil trespass, and ap∣plying
the feeble censure only of an award of damages; a sort
of amends which truly has no sort of proportion or relation
to an injury of this kind, which breaks in so deeply on the
happiness of the individual, and the welfare of a family, as
well as on the interests of decency and public order. For even
with those who are not corrupted by the example of infidelity,
it still tends to weaken, in some measure, that delicate and jea∣lous
sense of honour, which is the surest protection of female
virtue. What though the forfeit of the law is not exacted
in every instance: it in nowise follows that it is therefore
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
an useless law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ADULTER.</NOTE> or without a salutary influence on the man∣ners
of the people. The transgression still retains its de∣gree
and character, as settled by authority of the nation
in the penal code; and to have been guilty of any thing
of which this is the description, will always, with the sober
and reputable part of the community, be attended with so
much the more shame and disgrace on that very account.
And to this provision of our law it was, perhaps, in a
great measure owing, (a thing not a little honourable to this
country, and which it were to be wished that we had still to
boast of), that down to a very late period, the notion of this
high wrong, as commensurable with damages or pecuniary
reparation, had never been heard of in any Civil Court.</P>
<P>THOUGH directed to a salutary purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Adultery.</NOTE> our ancient or∣dinances
on this head, can, however, scarcely be vindicated
from the charge of excessive severity; and may indeed be su∣spected
not so much to have originated in any rational consi∣deration
of the injury, or a temperate regard to the public
good, as in that morose and austere temper, with which the
people of Scotland were infected at the Reformation, and
which occasioned an extreme antipathy to all irregular or
licentious intercourse of the sexes. Besides, they had in this
matter the example of the law of Moses before them, which
punished the adulterer with death; and in the fervency of
their zeal for the holy Scriptures, then first laid open to
them in the vulgar tongue, they were rashly disposed to in∣fer,
that the rules of the Mosaic dispensation were meant
for the indiscriminate observance of all times and countries.</P>
<P>1. OUR oldest provision on this subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes con∣cerning Adul∣tery.</NOTE> is the act 1551.
c. 20. which passed before the downfal of Popery, and on∣ly
<PB N="304" REF="305"/>
directed with respect to a common and incorrigible adul∣terer,
that he should be put to the horn, and suffer the or∣dinary
consequences of that sort of rebellion. But the next
in date, the statute 1563, c. 74. which passed in the very
heat of the Reformation, makes a wide step, and at once ap∣plies
the curb of the highest pains of law, to this (as it terms
it) “abominabil and filthie vice and crime of adulterie,
which has bene perniciously and wickedly used within
this realm in times bygane.” It enjoins the execution
of all former laws, made upon the matter of simple or un∣aggravated
adultery; and with respect to “all notour or
manifest committers of adulterie in onie time to cum,” it
orders, that they “sall be punished with all rigour unto the
death, as weil the woman as the man, doer and commit∣ter
of the samin.”</P>
<P>ADULTERY is thus distinguished in our practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notour Adul∣tery; what it is.</NOTE> into that
which is simple, and that which is manifest, or incorrigible,
and notour; of which last, this character is given in the act
1551, and is repeated, though in more general terms, in the
act 1563, that the parties persist in their intercourse, “and
will not desist and cease therefra, for feare of ony spiritual
jurisdiction or censures of halie kirk, to the great perrel
of their awin saules;” but sustain “the processe of halie
kirk, sa far as the samin may extend to.” But, by a later
statute, 1581, c. 105, which, under colour of explaining this
part of the older laws, in truth made a large addition to them,
but was ratified and ordered to be put to execution by the act
1701, c. 11. the appellation of <HI>notour</HI> was applied alike to the
three several cases, of adultery attended with procreation of
a child, or with open and notorious company and bedding
of the parties, or with contempt of the church's admonition,
given on the suspicion and scandal of the sin, and with ex∣communication
<PB N="305" REF="306"/>
for that contempt. In either of the two
former and stronger cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 12. 1676.</NOTE> (as was found in the trial of Janet
Spence), no course of ecclesiastical discipline is requisite.</P>
<P>IF Mackenzie's opinion in this matter were to be followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes are the sole Warrant of capital Pains.</NOTE>
even these are not the only degrees of adultery, to which the
highest pains of law may warrantably be applied. For, says
he, “this act does not <HI>exclude</HI> capital punishment in other
cases of adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. Adultery, No. 3.</NOTE> but only ordains that these three degrees
<HI>shall be</HI> punished with death.” But I think it may with
certainty be concluded, that in every instance where by a
correctory law, a crime not formerly capital is made so as
to certain more heinous degrees; and where these degrees are
not left to opinion or construction, but are defined by a later
law in plain and express terms; there is no room for the ex∣tending
of this new sanction to any other case, how fla∣grant
soever in itself, on any argument of proportion or ana∣logy.
It might well be doubted, whether such a licence would
be warrantable, if it had even the countenance of those pre∣cedents,
to which Mackenzie in support of his own sentiment
has appealed. But in truth those cases are no precedents at all
on the matter. The three adulteries in Sir John Stuart's case
were all of them notour, by procreation of children. And
Margaret Hamilton was not executed, as Mackenzie has
supposed, under the certification purely of her first sentence,
but upon a second conviction of another act of adultery,
committed after her return to Scotland, and of which a
child was born.</P>
<P>THE same author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simple Adulte∣ry is not capital.</NOTE> in the succeeding passage to the above,
seems to have advanced another questionable piece of doc∣trine,
<PB N="306" REF="307"/>
when he argues, that even simple adultery may, “for
the good of the commonwealth,” be punished by the Ma∣gistrate,
at his discretion, with the highest pains. I cannot
find that there is even <HI>scintilla juris</HI> for such an opinion. In∣deed,
the contrary is implied in the whole strain and tenor
of the act 1563 itself, which on any other supposition was
an useless and even a hurtful law; and would have tended
to the encouragement rather than to “the eschewing” of
the vice of adultery, which, as the preamble tells us, was the
motive of the Legislature. To say more on this head, may
be thought unnecessary after the judgment in the case of
Nicolson and Maxwell, (January 25. 1694), which in point∣ed
terms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the indictment as to the simple adultery relevant to infer an arbi∣trary punishment, and that there were bairns one or more procreate betwixt the pannels, or that they were notour and manifest adulterers, likewise relevant to infer the pains of death libelled.”</NOTE> distinguishes the lawful pains of the two degrees.
In the later case of Murdoch and Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 14. 1699.</NOTE> the Lord Advo∣cate,
who had founded his libel for simple adultery on the
Canon law, and at first insisted for a capital punishment,
found it necessary in the end to depart from that conclusion.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that if there be any room for controversy
touching the pains of simple adultery, it will rather be, whe∣ther
the Court have not in some instances gone too far, when
they have pronounced sentence of banishment or of scour∣ging;
seeing that none of the later statutes are special in that
respect, and that by the act 1551, the earliest of them all,
even a manifest adulterer is only to suffer the penalties of
denunciation at the horn.</P>
<P>BESIDE the personal consequences which attend the con∣viction
of adultery, our Legislature have thought proper to
<PB N="307" REF="308"/>
guard against that offence, by inflicting certain civil dis∣abilities,
which may tend to lessen the temptation, or are
material to the interest of other persons, the near connec∣tions
of the parties. For the latter reason, a woman divor∣ced
for adultery, who marries her paramour, or openly co∣habits
with him, is by statute 1592, c. 119. disabled to do
any deed respecting her real estate, to the prejudice of her
heirs. With a view to the former object, the statute 1600,
c. 20. declares the marriage of the adulterous parties to be
null and unlawful, and their issue incapable of succession.</P>
<P>To speak of those things which are common to both modes
of the offence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is adultery, though the Wo∣man be single, if the man is married.</NOTE> 1. Adultery, in our practice, is equally com∣mitted,
whether it be that a married man has knowledge of
an unmarried woman, or that a married woman is known
by an unmarried man. It is true, the civilians and fo∣reign
doctors have much disputed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Voet, Mathaeus, Clarus, and Van-Eck, maintain, that adultery was only committed <HI>cum nupta.</HI> Carpsovius and Wissenbach take the lead in supporting the more rigid opinion.</NOTE>, and not without plau∣sible
grounds, whether such was the rule of either the
civil law, or the law of Moses. And certainly it is not to
be denied, that the more heinous mode of the offence is in the
seduction of a married woman, which at once dries up the main
source of the happiness and welfare of the family; neither
can it be said, that the expressions of our statutes are in them∣selves
decisive of the question, either way. Yet our custom,
(I think on the whole, with a wiser policy and founder judg∣ment,
though perhaps chiefly actuated in the beginning by
regard to the consideration of the sin, and the peril to the
souls of the parties), has always disowned any such distinc∣tion;
<PB N="308" REF="309"/>
and in this article, as in the matter of divorce, has
invested the spouses with equal privileges, prescribed to both
one line of duty, and subjected them to the trial of the same
rigid and salutary rule. Witness, among other instances which
might be mentioned, the case of John Fraser, and of Nicol∣son
and Maxwell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 17. 1673. Jan. 25. 1694.</NOTE> where this point underwent a full dis∣cussion.</P>
<P>2. IT is obvious, that there can be no adultery without
violation of the bond of a present and subsisting marriage.
Though the pannel have once been married; yet, if before
the date of the fact charged in the libel, the union has been
dissolved by a regular divorce, the spouses are thereby re∣stored
to their free and single state.</P>
<P>3. IN this I incline to differ from Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the Marriage was unlawful.</NOTE> who, in his
whole treatise of Adultery, rather inclines to a rigorous con∣struction,
that I think the marriage must not only be a sub∣sisting,
but a lawful marriage; such as is no infringement of
any of the prohibitions of the law on that head. For other∣wise,
(as for instance, if it be contracted within the forbid∣den
degrees); to punish the accused for the violation of du∣ties,
whereunto he is not truly bound, and in circumstances
where he will be even punishable for continuing to adhere,
if he be in the knowledge of the impediment, should seem
to be both incongruous and unjust. To establish the mar∣riage,
is the first, and a necessary part of the trial upon eve∣ry
libel for adultery; and if, at the same time that the ce∣remony
is proved to have taken place, it is shewn to have
been a vain and inefficacious ceremony, as to any effect of
begetting relation between the parties, or binding them to
the duties, or bestowing the rights and privileges, of the
<PB N="309" REF="310"/>
matrimonial state, the case is the same in substance, as if
this part of the proof had entirely failed. That the pannel
was guilty in intention, does not obviate the objection; since
punishments are not inflicted in the temporal courts, for the
corrupt purposes or dispositions of the heart, but for the evil
and pernicious deeds which have been done in violation of
the laws.</P>
<P>ONE situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Mar∣riage challenge∣able on the Head of Impo∣tence.</NOTE> however, there is (though not very likely
to happen), which may seem to warrant a construction not so
favourable to the offender,—that of a marriage which is
liable to be rescinded by reason of impotence. For although
lawyers have spoken of this defect as a nullity of the con∣tract,
rather than a ground of divorce; yet it seems to be
such a cause of challenge, as, in more respects than one, is
upon a very different footing from those other and proper
nullities with which our books have classed it. The distinc∣tion
lies here; that impotence, like adultery or desertion, is
of the nature of a pure personal cause of complaint; which
if the spouse herself dissemble, no third party, upon any the
strongest ground of patrimonial interest, (the heir for instance
of the deceased husband, in order to exclude the widow from
her terce), will be allowed to plead. In which it is quite
unlike a challenge on the ground of near relation or pre∣vious
marriage; which are a common and public ground of
plea to all who can show a proper interest in the trial of the
question. Farther, in these situations there is an absolute im∣pediment,
such as attaches to the act itself of the matrimonial
consent, and makes it vanish at the very moment when it is
given; seeing that, between persons who are so circumstan∣ced,
the law forbids any such consent to be exchanged. Now,
it is quite otherwise in the case of impotency. For, doubtless,
<PB N="310" REF="311"/>
if so disposed. the parties may lawfully, and without scandal,
or the breach of any precept, divine or human, continue to
live together; and far from being null, their act of consent,
(which by our law is alone the marriage, whether followed by
consummation or not), is in itself good at the time when given;
so that if by any accident the couple should be separated af∣ter
celebration of the ceremony, and be kept asunder against
their will, they would continue to be married persons for the
rest of their lives. If, therefore, the party concerned shall
dissemble the grievance, and rather than have recourse to the
remedy which the law has provided for such a case, shall
choose to continue in possession of the civil state and cha∣racter
of wife; she has fairly made, and must adhere to her
option, subject to all the duties, and that of fidelity among
others, which are incident to that relation; and whereof
the violation would be of the same evil example here, and
would occasion the same public scandal, as in any other case.
This, however, is a nice question, and of that sort upon
which it may be very long before a court have any oppor∣tunity
of giving their opinion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maclaurin, p. 732.</NOTE> though I find that in one
instance such a plea had been made use of.</P>
<P>4. THOUGH there be a subsisting and unexceptionable mar∣riage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Effect of Error▪ as to the Sub∣sistence of the Marriage.</NOTE>
yet still adultery is no crime with respect to that one
of the pannels, where such there happens to be, who is ig∣norant
of the married state of the other party. Because, in
these circumstances, not only is there no room for the charge
of any evil purpose; but it may be, (as for instance, in the case
of a woman who is betrayed into a marriage with a man who
is already married), that this pannel is grievously injured, and
suffers even a greater wrong than the lawful spouse herself.
Hence, as this is not one of those acts which in themselves
<PB N="311" REF="312"/>
imply dole, and lay the proof of innocent intention on the
pannel, but, according to the circumstances, may be either a
harmless act, or one of some inferior degree of guilt; so it
seems to lie with the prosecutor, in support of his libel, to
bring such a proof, either of the general notoriety of the
marriage, or of the pannel's special knowledge of it, as may
make room for that <HI>malus animus,</HI> which is essential to the
crime.</P>
<P>FARTHER, even with respect to that one of the parties
who is married, and against whom, in the common case, a
presumption of dole must lie; there seems, nevertheless, to
be room for a good plea, to the effect at least of avoiding
the statutory pains of adultery, if he or she, on probable
and reasonable grounds, believed the marriage to have been
dissolved by death: in which situation, not only can the
pannel not be justly charged with the proper dole of the
crime, but even the scandal of the intercourse is also in a
great measure done away. With respect to the just and suffi∣cient
grounds of such a belief; these are hardly to be deci∣ded
by any general rule, but will be more proper for the
consideration of the jury on the whole circumstances of the
particular case: such as the long absence of the party with∣out
notice got of him; the common rumour and belief of
his decease; the accounts which have actually been recei∣ved
to that effect; the pains bestowed to search the truth
of these accounts, and the like.</P>
<P>Two cases may perhaps be quoted as hostile to this indul∣gence,
—that of John Fraser in 1674, reported by Arnot,
(and perhaps related more correctly before him by Mac∣kenzie),
and the case of Janet Spence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 12. 26. and July 24. 1676.</NOTE> a sailor's wife, whose
defence, of the long absence of her husband, and the common
rumour of his death, was repelled. But Fraser had a pardon
before sentence; and Spence also, though convicted of no∣tour
adultery, did not experience the utmost rigour of the law,
<PB N="312" REF="313"/>
but was suffered to escape, (which at that time was a course
of lenity), with sentence of transportation; having offer∣ed
a supplication to the Court, in which she set forth the
hardship of her case. Indeed, it is far from being clear,
that the interlocutor in either of these instances was intend∣ed
any otherwise than as a special judgment on the particu∣lar
grounds of error alleged for these pannels, as being short
of those strong and pregnant reasons of belief, to which
alone in this question, the law can properly pay regard.</P>
<P>III. THESE seem to be the requisite qualifications of the
crime of adultery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may pro∣secute for Adul∣tery.</NOTE> For which a prosecution may equally be
brought at instance of the injured spouse, if so disposed, (as
in Fraser's case), or at instance of the Lord Advocate; whose
interest is independent of the concurrence, or even of the
remission of the private party; as was found in the case
of Nicolson, in January 1694. It seems however, (and so
Mackenzie has said), to be a just and natural exception
to the husband's title, if he has himself been privy and
aiding to the dishonour of his spouse; as by making gain of
her person, or contriving the occasions of meeting, or even
by conniving at her gallantries. If this be true of him, with
respect to the very acts that are charged in the libel; then
is he art and part of those adulteries, and cannot prosecute
his own associate, who is far less criminal than he. And
though it be only true of her other and previous amours;
this seems still to be a distinction of that sort to which the
law can pay no manner of regard, in admitting any one to
prosecute as for an injury, and to the end of inflicting pu∣nishment
on the very person, whose morals and affections
were under his own peculiar guardianship, and whom he has
betrayed to shame and misery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10. 1668.</NOTE> The case of Elizabeth Moor,
<PB N="313" REF="314"/>
which Mackenzie alludes to, is truly no precedent on the
other side; and this not only for the reason given by that
author, but because the woman's allegation does not seem to
have been pointed and specific, of her husband's privity to
other adulteries of which she had been guilty, but only of
promises and solicitations which tended to her dishonour.</P>
<P>IV. RESPECTING the proof of this offence,—I shall only
say, (though without any purpose of denying that circum∣stantial
evidence must sometimes be received), that Macken∣zie
seems to be mistaken in citing the case of Janet Brown,
and that of Elizabeth Moor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21. 1664. Dec. 10. 1668.</NOTE> as instances of conviction in that
way; for in the former there was one direct testimony to
the fact, and in the other there were two. Of whichever sort
the proof be, it must be taken, (as in all other cases, excepting
trial for forgery), in presence of the assize themselves;
who cannot lawfully pay regard to any decree of divorce
that may be produced<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The decision to that effect, in the case of Hay of Dalgety, August 1. 1598, which is mentioned by Mackenzie, was not given by the Court, who seem to have allowed production of the decree, but by the jury, who divided upon the question, nine to six.</NOTE> to them, nor to the testimonies which
are there engrossed. And this, notwithstanding what Mac∣kenzie
has suggested, may certainly be held to be alike the
rule, in the trial for simple as for notour adultery.</P>
<P>I HAVE observed only the following instances of capital
sentence pronounced, and executed, for this crime. The
case of John Guthrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 14. &amp; April 16. 1617.</NOTE> who had married and cohabited with
a second wife, during the lifetime of the first. The case of
Marion Kempt and Patrick Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. 1627.</NOTE> where the adulte∣ry
was notour by procreation of children, (but here the
destroying of a conception by a poisonous draught was
<PB N="314" REF="315"/>
also charged). The case of Marion Alston, and that of Mar∣garet
Thomson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 23. 1631. May 28. 1677.</NOTE> in both of which also the adultery was no∣tour
by procreation of children. It appears that the rigour
of the law was often avoided even in cases of repeated
guilt, and of the highest kind<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>See case of David Gray and Elspeth Hissop, Dec. 17. 1601, Nov. 27. 1602, banished, carted, and fined; of Alexander Thomson, March 14. 1617, ba∣nished and forfeited of moveables; of John Redpath, December 4. 1662, scourg∣ed and banished.</P>
<P>Also, May 11. 1570, Patrick Urquhart, <HI>convict. et wardat.</HI>—June 14. 1570, Carnbie, <HI>convict. et wardat.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE instances are, however, numerous, of conviction of
this offence, joined to the murder of the adulterous issue,
or the injured spouse. As in the case of Andrew Rowan,
August 2. 1627; of John Swinton, April 21. 1664; Elizabeth
Moor, December 10. 1688; Margaret Hamilton, May 17.
1665; Margaret Taylor, June 24. 1663; Marion Smith,
April 14. 1665. And here, in passing, it may be remarked
on these miserable cases of complicated guilt, that they fur∣nish
(if any were needed) another evidence of the wisdom of
our practice, in stigmatising as a crime this sinful intercourse,
which thus suppresses all the feelings of nature, and leads
to the mortal hatred of the nearest relations.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF BIGAMY AND CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>I. ANOTHER crime of the same class with adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XX.</NOTE> and
which indeed will commonly involve the capital
species of that offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason why Bi∣gamy is punish∣ed.</NOTE> is bigamy; or the contracting of a
second marriage, standing the former. This, in every point
of view, is a great wrong, and high infringement of civil or∣der:
being with respect to the first spouse, a treacherous deser∣tion
of the many serious and interesting duties, to which the
offender stood solemnly contracted; and with respect also
to the second spouse, where that person, (as commonly hap∣pens),
is ignorant of the impediment, being a no less cruel
and infamous deceit; as well as with respect to the public,
it is a presumptuous and flagrant breach of that laudable
discipline and oeconomy, which the wisdom of the nation
has established for purposes of the highest importance.</P>
<P>AT the date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigamy, how punishable.</NOTE> however, of our only statute respecting biga∣my,
the statute 1551, c. 19. this offence seems chiefly to have
been considered in a religious point of view; as a sort of
perjury, or violation of the sacrament and solemn vow or
<PB N="316" REF="317"/>
oath, which was then used in the contracting of marriage;
and with the proper pains of perjury, it was accordingly or∣dained
to be punished.</P>
<P>1. THE most important question concerning the descrip∣tion
of bigamy relates to the quality of the two marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Must both Mar∣riages be by re∣gular Celebra∣tion.</NOTE>
which must concur to it; whether both must be marriages
by formal celebration, or if it will be sufficient, though both
or one of them be contracted in that loose and unceremonious
fashion, which is sustained by the custom of Scotland. In
this (as it must be admitted to be) both delicate and important
inquiry, we have as yet no aid of precedent, nor even of
argument or debate to guide us. It is however obvious,
in favour of the more lenient opinion, that it has the counte∣nance
of the general strain, and of several of the expressions
of the statute<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“It is statute and ordained, that whatsumever person marries twa sindrie wives, or women marries twa sindrie husbands, livand together, undivorced lawfully, contrair the <HI>aith and promise maid at the solemnisation and contracting of the matrimony,</HI> and swa are of the law perjured and infamous, therefore, that the paines of perjuring be execute upon them with all rigour.”</NOTE>, which was made at a time when there was
no marriage without celebration; and which, in applying
the pains of <HI>perjury</HI> to this offence, plainly supposes the con∣tempt
of a solemn oath or vow, and an abuse of the service
of religion.</P>
<P>STATING the case therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of both Marriages being without Cele∣bration.</NOTE> (certainly the most favourable
of any to the offender), of both connections being of this
ambiguous and equivocal character, as by promise and <HI>co∣pula,</HI>
or courtship and acknowledgments, or the like; it
may be urged for the pannel, that here has been no solemn
<PB N="317" REF="318"/>
entry into the holy state, no prostitution of the religious ce∣remony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BIGAMY, &amp;c.</NOTE>
or of the ministry of the church. And farther, it
may be urged, on the merits of the question in itself, that cir∣cumstances
such as these, relevant as they may be found in the
civil question of state, which must necessarily be sometimes
decided on probabilities and presumptions, do not however
yield that clear and decisive evidence of dole, and of a set∣tled
purpose to marry and betray, without which there can
be no conviction of the crime of bigamy.</P>
<P>THIS argument will not so strongly apply to the case of
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a regu∣lar Marriage fol∣lowed with clandestine In∣tercourse.</NOTE> who after having duly solemnised a marriage, betakes
himself to some clandestine and irregular connection. But
even for him, it may with some show of reason be argued,
that as he well knew himself to be already married, and to
be for the time incapable of any second marriage; so must
it be presumed in his favour, as long as it possibly can, and
until he take that decisive step of again undergoing the ce∣remony,
which does not admit of an innocent construction,
that he had no wicked or deceitful purpose in that respect,
but truly, notwithstanding any appearances of the contrary,
intended to carry on an intercourse of a quite different sort,
and for that very reason avoided the celebration of the ce∣remony,
Besides, the party injured has not in these circum∣stances
the same reasons of resentment and complaint, as one
who has been regularly married; having come into this
situation by the wilful neglect of those precautions, and that
public order, by proclamation of banns, and so forth, which
the law has instituted and devised to this very end, of disco∣vering
all impediments to the proposed alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319"/>
A THIRD, and a less favourable case to the offender than
either of the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of clan∣destine Inter∣course <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ior to regular Mar∣riage.</NOTE> is that of a regular marriage subse∣quent
to some clandestine connection; though I shall not
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irm, that even here we have got the proper materials of
the crime of bigamy. At least with respect to those equi∣vocal
and doubtful situations, (the most frequent of any),
where the complainer has not been in possession of the
repute and state of a married woman, but is in the case
of a mere claimant, or pretender to that character, upon
grounds not known with certainty to any but herself; it
seems to merit consideration on the pannel's part, that pos∣sibly
after all he neither intended to marry, (notwithstand∣ing
what the civil court may have found), nor even un∣derstood
that a marriage could be effectually made in any
such way; and that in this opinion and belief he proceed∣ed
publicly to contract himself to another woman.</P>
<P>THE case, however, alters materially to the disadvantage
of the pannel, if, instead of this secret and ambiguous in∣tercourse,
we suppose the complainer to have been in the
full and continued enjoyment, not only of that degree of re∣pute,
which a civil court, in case of challenge, might pos∣sibly
sustain as sufficient to make her a wife; but of that de∣cisive,
public, and invariable character which hinders any
doubt to be moved upon the matter. And that the cri∣minal
court would not, in these circumstances, find the re∣levant
qualifications of bigamy, it would certainly be rash to
say; though no case of this character has yet happened,
to afford me any authority upon which I can affirm that such
is the law.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320"/>
2. THUS much of the form of the two marriages. Next
of the other qualities which are required in the first mar∣riage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Marriage must be lawful:</NOTE>
to bring it under this safeguard of the law.</P>
<P>RESPECTING this, it seems to be clear, that it must be a
lawful marriage; such which has not been contracted in con∣tempt
of any of the injunctions of the law; as between those
who are too near of kin, or who have been previously con∣victed
of adultery. As in every case of this description, the
contract is fundamentally null; so it seems to be all one, as
if the ceremony had never been performed: And it were
absurd to imagine, that the law shall employ its vengeance
in defence of that which itself hath forbidden. Touching
a marriage that is challengeable by reason of impotence, the
same observations will apply, which were made in treating
of the crime of adultery.</P>
<P>3. THE marriage must not only be a lawful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And still subsist∣ing.</NOTE> but a sub∣sisting
marriage. If, before the second marriage, the first
has been dissolved by divorce in the course of law, the
parties are again free to contract anew. And this the
statute itself, equally as the reason of the thing, indicates,
when, speaking of the spouses, it uses these terms, “li∣vand
together undivorced, lawfully;” which must either
mean <HI>living together, lawfully married, and undivorced,</HI> (which
is the more natural sense), or it must mean, <HI>living together,
and not separated by any lawful divorce.</HI> Whichsoever be the
true construction, Mackenzie's remark seems to be equally
just; that though the decree of divorce be afterwards set
aside, yet still it shall afford a good defence to the party,
who, in the mean time, on the faith of it, and before any
challenge of it has been moved, proceeds to form another al∣liance.
But the exception also from this rule seems to be no
less suitable, in case of the reduction taking place upon any
<PB N="320" REF="321"/>
of those grounds, of bribery, suborned evidence, or other
evil device on the part of the pannel, which imply the dole
and malice of the contriver, and cannot therefore, in any
question, result to his advantage<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Twelve Judges of England were of this opinion in the Dutchess of Kingston's case, upon allegation of a collusive decree of jactitation. April 1776.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>4. THERE seems to be the same reason here, as in cases of
adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Bigamy owing to Error.</NOTE> for admitting a proof on the part of the pannel,
that the former marriage was truly, and on reasonable
grounds, believed to have been dissolved by death. John
Campbell was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 9. 1680.</NOTE> however, convicted of bigamy, and senten∣ced
to the statutory pains, upon the pure evidence of his
own confession, which bore, (though to be sure, without any
specification of the grounds of his opinion), that he believed
his first wife to have been dead.</P>
<P>5. IN regard to the second marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What if the se∣cond Marriage be incestuous, &amp;c.</NOTE> if it be formal and ce∣remonious,
it matters not how vitious and exceptionable it
be in other respects. It is always a null marriage, as con∣tracted
standing a former; and if it be also an incestuous,
adulterous, or otherwise forbidden marriage, this additional
fault cannot take away the guilt, or protect against the pains
of bigamy.</P>
<P>6. THE guilt of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and Part of Bigamy.</NOTE> according to circumstances,
may either be the exclusive guilt of that one of the par∣ties
in whose person there is a double marriage; or it may
be the common guilt of both the parties to the second mar∣riage,
although to one of them it be the first contract of
that sort. The former holds with respect to the second wife,
<PB N="321" REF="322"/>
(or husband, as the case happens to be), who knew not of the
impediment of the former marriage; and who in this situ∣ation
not only is in nowise criminal, but has been cruelly
betrayed, and is perhaps the greatest sufferer of any. But
if the second wife has been in the knowledge of the impedi∣ment;
then, though there be no proper bigamy in her own
person, as contracting for the first time, yet is she art and
part of the bigamy committed by the man, and committed
through her aid, who knows, adopts, and deliberately con∣summates,
the intended wrong. The same is true of the priest
who marries the couple, if he is in the certain knowledge of
the prior and subsisting marriage; and this equally whether
there be or be not imposition by one of the parties who come
before him, on the other: For still he accomplishes an act of
bigamy, and prostitutes his holy office to the doing of that
which he knows to be sinful and criminal. The witnesses
shall likewise be art and part, if they, being privy to the
fact, and to the intended fraud, have aided in the execution
of it, by wilfully concealing the truth from the priest, or
from either of the parties. Whether their presence at the
ceremony will be sufficient to implicate them, in the case
that all concerned are apprised of the true situation of
things, may be more doubtful, and is undecided. That the
statute only speaks of men “wha marries twa sindrie wives,”
or “women wha marries twa sindrie husbands,” is no ar∣gument
against conviction on these grounds. It was the bu∣siness
of the Legislature to create, and in a general way to
describe the body of the main offence; which, when once
constituted, and made a part of the system, falls to be judged
of in the matter of accession, and other relative doctrines,
according to the ordinary rules of law and common sense.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="323"/>
7. THE statute not only appoints the pains to be those of
perjury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutory pains of Bigamy.</NOTE> but has also said what those pains shall be under∣stood
to be. “That is to say, confiscation of all their gudes,
moveable, warding of their persones for zeir and day, and
langer induring the Queenes will, and as infamous per∣sons,
never able to bruick office, honour, dignitie, nor be∣nefice
in time to cum.” This direction has not however,
in every instance, been strictly complied with. John Job
workman in Leith, was whipped and banished for bigamy,
on 19th June 1650.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 9. 1630. Mar. 9. 1631.</NOTE> And William Lauchlan, for the same
crime, was banished.</P>
<P>IT is also to be observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Same fact may be Bigamy and Notour Adulte∣ry.</NOTE> that it may sometimes depend on
the prosecutor's pleasure to libel the same fact as bigamy, or
as notour adultery, (that is, by procreation of children,
of open cohabitation of the parties); under which last appel∣lation,
he may even relevantly insist in a capital conclusion.
Upon this footing, John Guthrie, <HI>alias</HI> William Laird, had
sentence of death, March 14. 1617. And on the same
ground, libel for notour adultery was sent to an assize,
and a conviction obtained, in the case of John Fraser, writer
in Edinburgh, in November 1673. Nor can these proceed∣ings
be quarrelled as unlawful; since the adultery certainly is
not the less such, nor the less scandalous and manifest, for
being attended with the false assumption of the character of
man and wife. And perhaps to this very reason, that biga∣my
could be punished to such an extend in the more aggra∣vated
cases, it was owing, that the pains of that offence were
not made the subject of a new and more severe enactment,
at the same time with those of adultery and incest, and
the other crimes of the same class, which were all subjected
<PB N="323" REF="324"/>
to a more rigorous course of discipline at the period of the
Reformation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLANDESTINE. MARRIAGE.</NOTE></P>
<P>I HAVE occasionally mentioned the few instances of prose∣cution
for this crime, that I have found in the books of ad∣journal.</P>
<P>II. THE offence of clandestine marriage, naturally con∣nects
with that of bigamy. It is committed by the non-ob∣servance
of that laudable and public order in the contract∣ing
of marriage, which the law, for obvious and salutary
purposes, has enjoined. It is well known, that the custom of
Scotland imposes very little restraint on the inclinations of
such persons, who are desirous of entering into the state of
matrimony. They may accomplish their union, not only
without any assistance of religion or the church, but even
without the use of any appointed civil form; so the couple
themselves, though unauthorised by the will of parents, or
guardians, do explicitly, fully, and deliberately consent. But
although our law, which in this seems to be guided upon
the whole by wise and liberal considerations of policy, does
permit and suffer, yet it by no means approves, or would en∣courage,
the contracting of marriage in this private and
unceremonious fashion; attended as it is with the plain ha∣zard,
not only of rash and unsuitable matches, but of inces∣tuous,
adulterous, or otherwise unlawful alliances. On the
contrary, it bestows on all marriage of this description,
the name of clandestine and disorderly; and holds no mar∣riage
to be right or inoffensive, but that which is celebrated
by a priest, duly authorised by the church, and after procla∣mation
of banns.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="325"/>
To secure obedience in this particular, the Legislature

and witnesses, as for the parties themselves.</P>
<P>BY statute 1661, c. 34. the parties are liable to imprison∣ment
for three months, and to certain fines, according to
their rank; which fines are to be decreed for in the civil
courts, and may be enforced by imprisonment, and shall be
applied to pious uses within the parish. In case of inability to
pay the fine, the offender is to be punished “with stocks and
irons.” Farther, in the case of their being married by a
person not duly ordained, the parties are, by act 1672, c. 9.
forfeited of their legal rights of <HI>jus mariti</HI> and <HI>jus relictae;</HI>
but this penalty seems to be taken away through the repeal
of that law, by the act 1690, c. 27.</P>
<P>UNDER the act 1698,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penalties on the Witnesses.</NOTE> c. 6. the witnesses are liable to a
fine of L. 100 Scots each; and in order the better to secure
the detection both of them and the celebrator of the mar∣riage,
the parties are, by the same statute, subjected to cer∣tain
fines, proportioned to their rank, and higher than those
in the act 1661, in case they shall refuse to reveal the names
of the persons who have officiated in these capacities. It ra∣ther
appears, that in the case of such refusal, these fines
are meant to come in place of, and not to be exigible from
the parties, over and above those other penalties, which are
set down in the act 1661. The care of decreeing for these
pecuniary pains is, by that act, remitted to the civil Judge;
and as this does not seem to be altered by any of the later
laws, so our attention shall chiefly be directed towards those
things which concern the celebrator of the marriage, who
alone has ever been prosecuted in a criminal court.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="326"/>
WITH respect to him, the sanction of the statute 1661,
c. 34. is, that he “be banished the kingdom, never to return
therein under the pain of death.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penalties on the Celebrator.</NOTE> And by the act 1698,
c. 6. which ratifies the former, he is made liable (beside sei∣zure
and imprisonment for trial, at the discretion of any or∣dinary
Magistrate) to “such pecunial or corporal pains as
the said Lords of Privy Council shall think fit to inflict.”
Whether the Lords of Justiciary shall be held to have suc∣ceeded
to the discretionary power, thus specially bestowed
on the Lords of Privy Council, I shall not venture to deter∣mine;
but certain it is, that if they enjoy, they have not
made use of it; for there is no sentence upon record, which
inflicts any penalty additional to what are appointed by the
act 1661.</P>

regular in other respects, if he is not a person (to use the
words of the statute 1661) who has been authorised by
the kirk;—regularly called, that is, to the exercise of the
pastoral functions within this country of Scotland: be∣ing,
for instance, a Jesuit or Popish priest; or a deposed
minister of the Established Church<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">June 18. 1590.

George II. c. 34. It is not a good objection, which has been
made to this last application of the law, that the statute 1661
passed at a time when Episcopacy was the communion by
law established. For these restraints are not to be considered
as having been instituted by way of favour or privilege
merely to any one communion or set of clergy, in preference
to others, but for the general benefit of the people, and bet∣ter
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> land, in the hindering of improper mar∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

of celebrating the ceremony to such persons as by national
authority, and according to the state of public order and dis∣cipline
for the time, are duly vested with the pastoral office.
Being thus founded upon reasons of a general and perma∣nent
nature, those provisions apply equally in all changes
of communion or church-government; in like manner as the
treason-laws, which were enacted for the national tranquil∣lity
under the Tudors and the Stuarts, now serve to secure
the House of Hanover upon the Throne. Upon the Circuit
at Inveraray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 10. 1755. See Arnot's Cases.</NOTE> John Connachar, an Episcopal pastor, was ac∣cordingly
convicted, and had sentence in terms of the sta∣tute,
upon this along with other the like charges; being nei∣ther
possessed of proper letters of orders, nor having taken
the necessary oaths.</P>
<P>IF this be true of one whose institution to the pastoral
office is only in some measure irregular or defective;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or if he is no Clergyman.</NOTE> much
more must it be law for him, who has truly no pretension
to the character of priest or pastor at all; but is a mere
lay impostor or intruder thereto, who has never received
any manner of call or ordination, and is therefore utterly
inexcusable, and guilty of a still more indecent and audacious
breach of order, in meddling with any of the functions of
<PB N="327" REF="328"/>
that holy office. Such a charge, among others, was brought
upon the statute 1661, against George Craighead, as a person
who falsely assumed the character of minister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. &amp; 6. 1750.</NOTE> and took up∣on
him to celebrate marriages; and being convicted, he was
banished from Scotland, under pain of death in case of re∣turn.</P>
<P>IT is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Marriage declared before a Magistrate.</NOTE> it sometimes happens, that a couple go into the
presence of a Magistrate, and there exchange the matrimo∣nial
consent; and in this there does not seem to be any
thing unlawful on the part of the Magistrate, who does not
pretend to marry them, or at all to officiate in the matter,
but merely serves as a reputable witness of the act and ci∣vil
contract of the parties. But if he should so far forget
himself, and step out of his civil office, as to pray on the
occasion, or pronounce the nuptial benediction, and act as
a clergyman would; and especially if he make a common
trade of this sort of interposition, and take a fee for his
trouble; his quality of Magistrate will not hinder this in∣decent
and unwarrantable conduct to be the proper subject
of the statutory pains.</P>
<P>2. THE other way of infringing the statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest is punish∣able, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not Pro∣claimed.</NOTE> and which
holds alike, whatsoever be the quality of the person offi∣ciating,
is, if marriage be celebrated without proclamation of
banns. This salutary precaution, which in its original was
a Popish institution, (being introduced by Lateran Council
of the year 1215, and sanctioned by the Canons of our Pro∣vincial
Councils<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Nullus sacerdos praesumat, aliquas personas matrimonialiter conjungere, nisi prius terna denuntiatione, in ec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> letia, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lice et solenniter praemissa, secun∣dum formam Concilii Generalis; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> qui voluerit, et valuerit, legitimum impedimentum opponat.” Canons of Provincial Councils, art. 65.</NOTE> 1242 and 1269), is one of the few rem∣nants,
<PB N="328" REF="329"/>
that were saved from the general wreck of the Popish
discipline. It remained in fresh observance at the date of
the act 1661, which therefore includes it as part of “the
laudable order and constitution of this Kirk,” therein or∣dered
to be maintained; as well as it is particularly requi∣red
in that clause of the same statute, which relates to the
marriage of Scots persons in England. It is specially men∣tioned
in the act 1695, c. 12. which is a temporary regula∣tion,
relative to the same subject. And, still more fully and
expressly, it is recognised as a necessary article of the order
of marriage, by statute 10. Anne, c. 7. which forbids the
Episcopal pastors to marry, unless banns have been pro∣claimed,
as well in the parish kirks of the residence of par∣ties,
as in the Episcopal meeting; and this under the penal∣ties
of the Scottish acts of Parliament against clandestine mar∣riage.
Relevancy was found upon a charge to that effect, in
the case of Alexander Duguid<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the said Mr Duguid, his marrying James Stewart and Taylor, notwithstanding their banns not being proclaimed in the parish church where the said parties did at the time reside, relevant to infer the penalties in∣flicted by law in the case of clandestine marriage.” He was not convicted of

in that of Archibald Muir, minister of Garvald, who was
charged, (but he was not convicted), with having officiated
in the marriage of his own daughter to Walter Nisbet, a
minor; and in the case of William Wyllie and David Strang<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find that Mr William Wyllie, pannel, having at any of the times libel∣led, clandestinely married any of the two persons mentioned in the libel against him, without proclamation of banns, relevant to infer the pains of law; as also, find that Mr David Strang having, the time libelled, clandestinely married the two persons, named in the libel against him, without proclamation of banns, relevant to infer the foresaid pains”</NOTE>,
<PB N="329" REF="330"/>
the former of whom was convicted, but suffered no judg∣ment,
that I have been able to discover. This was also part
of the charge against the aforesaid George Craighead, who
was indicted for marrying a girl of thirteen, to one who had
a wife alive; which accusation was found relevant in gene∣ral
terms, and issued in a verdict against the pannel. Far∣ther;
on the 18th March 1768, but only on his own petition,
Peter Wilson had sentence of banishment for marrying with∣out
banns proclaimed, or the consent of relations.</P>
<P>THE charge of this mode of the offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of non-proclamation of Banns.</NOTE> as it involves
the allegation of a negative, is attended with this peculia∣rity,
that the prosecutor, proving the celebration of the mar∣riage,
and that no certificate of proclamation of banns was
on that occasion produced to the minister, (for I conceive
that this at least may certainly be exacted of the prosecu∣tor),
has sufficiently made out his case; and thus transfers to
the pannel, the burden of showing, (which, however, in any
instance where it is true, must be always within his power),
that proclamation was duly made. If a false or forged cer∣tificate
of proclamation has been presented to the minister;
this will ordinarily be to him a sufficient excuse, who is not
blameable for failing to suspect such an imposition. But as
clear it is, that if he be privy to or contriver of the device,
(as sometimes happens), for the purpose of procuring to him∣self
an ostensible warrant of his wrong; then not only shall he
be still punishable for his own proper guilt as celebrator, not∣withstanding
this subtile precaution; but it may even be true,
(according to the lengths he has gone), that he shall be art
and part of the falsehood and abuse of trust committed by the
session-clerk; for which that person is doubtless answerable,
not to his constituents only, but also to the public and the
<PB N="330" REF="331"/>
law. If the minister admit that no certificate of proclama∣tion
was shown to him, but plead that the parties falsely af∣firmed
to him, that the law had been complied with; whether
this, of itself, is to be allowed as a good defence, may well be
doubted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This point was argued in the papers in Muir's case; but the interlocutor is in terms which do not imply any decision of it.</NOTE>: For in prudence he ought not to credit any
such averment, but ought rather to be suspicious of the want
of this, the regular, and ordinary, and accessible sort of evi∣dence
on the subject. Of itself, therefore, it will scarce∣ly
excuse him, that the parties alleged so; which he
might possibly give no credit to, or might very well un∣derstand
to be false. But, that he was truly over-reached
and imposed on, seems to be a relevant allegation, which
must be open to a proof on the pannel's part; if by a train
of facts and circumstances he can fully make it out.</P>
<P>THESE seem to be the only modes of this offence that
are the objects of the statutory pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Law on this subject.</NOTE> agreeably to the pre∣sent
rules of the Church, as recognised in law; for along
with those rules, if statute shall make any addition to them,
the term of clandestine marriage will extend its meaning.
In default of these, the common law, of its own native
strength, is sufficiently powerful to repress some of the higher
abuses in this quarter; if they are conducted in such a man∣ner,
as to bring them under any of the other and larger deno∣minations
of crime. Thus, it was a separate article of charge
against George Craighead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 5. &amp; 6. 1750.</NOTE> and was laid upon the common law,
and went to the jury along with the other articles, that he
had falsely assumed a fictitious name, and the character of
clergyman, and under these had married, and given certifi∣cates
<PB N="331" REF="332"/>
of marriage<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And further, by the laws of this and all other well governed realms, a person taking upon him to act as a minister or clergyman, and as such celebra∣ting a marriage, or signing an attestation or certificate thereof under a false or assumed name, &amp;c.” <HI>Major of the libel.</HI></NOTE>. Nay, though the man act under his own
name; still if he be in the public and common habit of as∣suming
the personage and performing the part of clergyman,
which neither really nor by pretension belongs to him; he
seems to be a criminal and false impostor, or cheat, whom
the common law may therefore chastise.</P>
<P>3. BY a clause in the act 1661,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Pro∣secutor.</NOTE> the Procurator for the
Church is constituted joint prosecutor of this offence along
with the Lord Advocate; but only before the civil Judge,
and for recovery of the pecuniary penalties. By the act of
the 7th Anne, c. 6. the right of action is limited to the
space of two months from the date of the transgression. It
seems, however, to be doubtful on the words, whether this
relates to any thing but the <HI>fines</HI> inflicted by that statute: At
any rate, the limitation is only for the benefit of the clergy
of the Episcopal communion. This defence was therefore
repelled in the case of Archibald Muir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. and Feb. 1727.</NOTE> minister of the esta∣blished

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF FORNICATION, DRUNKENNESS, AND UNNATURAL LUSTS.</HEAD>
<P>1. IN the three preceding Chapters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXI.</NOTE> I have treated at
some length of those offences which relate to the in∣tercourse
of the sexes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Fornication.</NOTE> excepting only the lowest of any, that
of fornication, or the carnal intercourse of man and woman,
out of wedlock. This irregularity is the subject of a full
and anxious statute of James VI. 1567, c. 13. entitled, “A∣nent
the filthie vice of fornication, and punishment of the
samin.” By this act, which is of the same Parliament with
those that punish incest and adultery with death, and which
stands immediately before them in the statute-book, the of∣fender,
man or woman, shall pay for the first fault a fine of
L. 40 Scots, and shall stand, bare-headed, and fastened, at
the market place, for the space of two hours; for the second
fault, shall pay a fine of 100 merks, have the head shaven,
and be again exposed in the same public fashion; and for
the third offence, shall pay a fine of L. 100, be thrice duck∣ed
in the foulest pool of the parish, and be banished the
town or parish for ever; and shall be again treated in the
same manner for every farther offence. In case of inability
<PB N="333" REF="334"/>
to pay the fines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORNICATION.</NOTE> the person is to be imprisoned and fed on
bread and water for so many days; which are more in num∣ber
as the offence is repeated. What attention was paid to
this rigid ordinance in the inferior judicatures, I have not
made the subject of inquiry; but in the records of the Su∣preme
Court, I have met with but one memorial of punish∣ment
inflicted in pursuance of it. And this occurs at that
period of our history, when irregularities of this sort were
watched with equal attention as more serious offences, and
under that same government which in England went the
length of making fornication, in the second instance, a fe∣lony
without benefit of clergy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackstone, b. 4. c. 4. No. 11.</NOTE>. I allude to the case of Christopher Little and Margaret Jamieson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24. 1653.</NOTE> whom the Usur∣per's
commissioners for administration of justice sentenced
to the statutory pains for the first offence. It is true, that
this transgression appears in the dittay and conviction also of
the noted Major Weir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1670.</NOTE> along with the high crimes which are
there set forth; but from the nature of the verdict, there
was no room for application of the statutory pains. It is al∣so
true, that the act 1696, c. 31. contains a general confir∣mation
of all prior statues passted against fornication and un∣cleanness;
but it has not, in any late instance, been thought
necessary to curb this voice of incontinence, by the public ex∣ample
of a criminal prosecution. It is not, however, to be
doubted, that the keeping of an open and notorious house of
lewdness, for the reception of indecent and disorderly visi∣tors,
is of itself such an offence, both against public decen∣cy,
and the quiet of the neighbourhood, as is punishable
even at common law, (and of this there are daily examples
in the burgh courts), with imprisonment or whipping, or
<PB N="334" REF="335"/>
with banishment from the vicinity, to which the scandal or
disturbance has been given<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The act 1426, c. 74. orders “that common women be put at the utmost ends of the town, where least perell of fire is, and that na man set them houses in the heart of the town, under the paine of ane unlaw, or zit receipt them under the samin paine.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN connection with this irregularity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excessive Drinking.</NOTE> I shall here take no∣tice
of the offence of notorious and excessive drinking;
which if it could effectually be restrained by penal laws,
would well deserve the serious attention of the Legislature:
on account of the manifold and great evils that attend the
spreading of this contagious vice, which is at once alike de∣structive
of the industry and honesty, the health and the
morality, of all who yield to the habit; not to mention the
instant danger of violent and outrageous crimes, which are
so often committed in this state of willful alienation of rea∣son.</P>
<P>AN old statute, 1436, c. 144.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against it.</NOTE> ordains that no man be found
in taverns “after the straike of nine hours,” under pain of
50s. By the act 1617, c. 20. a drunkard, (or he who haunts
tavern or alehouse “after ten hours at night, or any time of
the day, except in time of travel, or for ordinary refresh∣ments),”
shall pay a fine of L. 3 for the first offence, of
L. 5 for the second, and of L. 10 for the third; and shall
be put in the jugs, or sent to jail for the space of six,
or twelve, or twenty-four hours, (as it is the first, se∣cond,
or third offence), in case of refusal or inability to
pay these sums. The act 1661, c. 19. proportions the fine
to the rank of the offender; being for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant 20s.; for
a yeoman 40s▪; for a burgess, gentleman or heritor L. 10;
for a baron 20 merks; and for a nobleman L. 20; with an
<PB N="335" REF="336"/>
alternative of corporal punishment, according to the degree
of the fault, if the offender be unable to pay. These statutes are
ratified and renewed by others of a later date, 1672, c. 22.
1693, c. 40. 1696, c. 31. of which the first empowers the kirk-session,
in a certain case, to appoint an executor of these laws
for the parish; the second empowers the presbytery to ap∣point
a prosecutor and informer for the bounds; and the
third, besides various provisions tending to limit any review
of the sentence, throws the right of prosecution open to all
the world.</P>
<P>I SHALL now close this part of the catalogue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sodomy and Bestiality.</NOTE> with men∣tion
of those shameful and unnatural lusts, which are known
by the names of Sodomy and Bestiality; and which, by our
law, like that of most other countries in Europe, justly expose
the offender to be punished with death, as one whose very
presence is a pollution to the society of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>SUFFICE it to say with respect to the first, that the crime
is only mentioned twice in the course of our records. On
the 1st of September 1570, John Swan and John Litster, are
convicted “of the wild, filthie, execrabill, detestabill, and
unnatural sin of sodomy, otherwise named bougarie, abu∣sand
of their bodies with utheris, in contrare the lawes of
God, and all other human lawes.” They are doomed to
be strangled at a stake, and their bodies to be cast into a fire,
and burned to ashes. The other instance, is the case of Mi∣chael
Erskine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 2. 1630.</NOTE> “delated (as the record has it), of diverse
points of witchcraft and filthy sodomy.” He was con∣victed
“of the haill crimes, contained in his dittay,” with
exception of a single act of sorcery, and had sentence “to
be worried at ane staik while he be dead, and thereafter
his body to be burnt to ashes.”</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="337"/>
THERE have been more frequent instances of prosecution
for bestiality:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bestiality.</NOTE> as in the following cases among others, where
the trial issued in sentence of death; which was ordered to be
carried into execution in some unusual way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1. 1675.</NOTE> James Mitchell
had sentence to be drowned in the North Loch of Edinburgh,
between four and five in the morning; in order that the
public eye might not be offended by the spectacle of the
death of so vile a criminal. Andrew Love, 17th April
1662; Major Weir in April 1670; Thomas Fotheringham,
November 11. 1702; and George Robertson, December 14.
1719; were severally condemned to be strangled at a stake;
and, (that no vestige of them might be committed to our

ashes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4. 1734.</NOTE> In the case of David Oliphant, the attempt to com∣mit

<P>THE several offences of drunkenness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EGYPTIANS.</NOTE> fornication, clandes∣tine
marriage, bigamy, adultery, incest, and unnatural
lust, which have now been spoken of, have a natural coherence,
(and therefore I have treated of them in succession), as vio∣lations
of that order and decency of life, which in every
well regulated society it is one great object of the laws to
maintain. The offences which make the subject of this chap∣ter,
are not only cognisable for the fame reason; but also
as they are attended with some hazard to the peace and se∣curity
of the inhabitants of the land, both in property and
person.</P>
<P>1. THE first that I shall mention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egyptians; thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> History.</NOTE> is the offence of being
one of the persons called Egyptians, or Gypsies. Respect∣ing
the origin or extraction of the breed of people distin∣guished
by that name, (who seem to have been first taken
notice of about the year 1417), little more seems to be known
with any certainty, than that they were not an accidental
association of vagabonds, but a distinct and unmingled race
<PB N="338" REF="339"/>
of foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXII.</NOTE> who travelled into Europe from the cast<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Graelman, a German author, who has written a treatise on this subject, with considerable learning, endeavours to show from their manners, institutions, and language, that they were Hindoos of the lowest cast, who had been driven from their native country, by the conquests of Tamerlane.</NOTE>.
They first appeared in Hungary and Bohemia, (the countries
where they are still in the greatest numbers, and hence in
France they are called Bohemians), and seem to have given
themselves out for a set of holy men or pilgrims, who were
upon this expedition by way of penance, or on some reli∣gious
account. As such they accordingly received passes
and recommendations from the Princes in that quarter; by
means of which, and under the direction of their chiefs,
(or Dukes and Kings as they chose to call them), they quick∣ly
passed into and overspread all the other kingdoms of
Europe.</P>
<P>IT was however soon found, that their manners, and their
morals, did by no means correspond to the sanctity of their
pretended errand; and as new swarms of them were con∣tinually
coming forward, which were joined by all the idle
and dissolute of every country on their way; they came to
be felt as an intolerable nuisance, and in the course of the
16th century were every where proceeded against as such.
They were banished out of Spain in 1492; out of Germany
by an Imperial Constitution of 1500; out of France by an
edict in 1561, and by another in 1612; and out of England,
by statute of the 22d of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>THE laws of Scotland likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banished from Scotland under Pain of Death.</NOTE> in their numerous provi∣sions
for the restraint of rogues and vagabonds, never fail
to enumerate the Egyptians, as among the foremost and most
<PB N="339" REF="340"/>
incorrigible. But all ordinary means having proved insuffi∣cient
to restrain so numerous and so sturdy a crew, the Privy
Council at length, in June 1603, were induced to venture
on the more effectual expedient, (recommended by the ex∣ample
of some other realms), of at once ordering the whole
race to leave the kingdom by a certain day, and never to
return under the pain of death. A few years after, this pro∣clamation
was converted into a perpetual law, by statute
1609. c. 13.; with this farther convenient, but very severe pro∣vision
towards the more effectual execution of the order,
that it should be lawful to condemn and execute them to
the death, upon proof made of the single fact, “that they
are called, known, repute and holden Egyptians.” The
statute annuls at the same time all protections and warrants
purchased by the Egyptians from his Majesty or Privy Coun∣cil,
for their remaining within the realm; as also all pri∣vileges
purchased by any person to reset, entertain, or do
them any favour. It appears, indeed, from a paper in the
appendix to Maclaurin's Cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No. 29.</NOTE> that even the King's servants
and great officers had not kept their hands entirely pure of
this sort of treaty with the Egyptian chiefs; from whom
some supply of money might in this way be occasionally
ob∣tained.</P>
<P>THE first gypsies that were brought to trial on the statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trails on these Statutes.</NOTE>
were four persons of the name of Faa; who on the 31st
July 1611, had sentence to be hanged. They had pleaded
upon a special license from the Privy Council to abide with∣in
the country; but this appearing to be clogged with a
condition of finding surety for their appearance when
called on, and their surety being actually at the horn, for
<PB N="340" REF="341"/>
failure to present them; they were held to have infringed the
terms of their protection.</P>
<P>THE next trial was on the 19th and 24th July 1616, in the
case of other two Faa's and a Baillie (which seem to have
been the most noted names among the gypsies); and here
was started that plea which has since been repeated in al∣most
every case, but has always been over-ruled, viz. that
the act and proclamation were temporary ordinances, and
applicable only to such Egyptians as were in the coun∣try
at their date. These pannels, upon conviction, were or∣dered
by the Privy Council to find caution to the extent of
1000 merks to leave Scotland, and never to return; and ha∣ving
failed to comply with this injunction, they were in con∣sequence
condemned to die.</P>
<P>IN January 1624,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials of Egyp∣tians. Jan. 23. and 24.</NOTE> follows a still more severe example; no
fewer than eight men, among whom Captain John Faa, and
other five men of the name of Faa, being convicted, and doom∣ed
to death on the statute. Some days after, there were
brought to trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 29.</NOTE> Helen Faa, relict of the Captain, Lucretia Faa,
and other women, to the number of eleven; all of whom
were in like manner convicted, and condemned to be drown∣ed<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The assize for the maist part findis, that the persones on panell, are vaga∣boundis, and repute and holdin for Egyptianis, and be their remaining within this kingdome, and nocht removeing thaimeselfis furth yrof, conforme to the act of Parliament, findis thaime, and everie ane of thaime, giltie and culpable of contravening thereof.”</NOTE>.
But in the end, their doom was commuted for banish∣ment,
(under pain of death), to them and all their race.
The sentence was, however, executed on the male convicts;
and it appears that the terror of their fate had been of ma∣terial
<PB N="341" REF="342"/>
service; as for the space of more than 50 years from
that time, there is no trial of an Egyptian.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of that century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials of Egyp∣tians.</NOTE> the nuisance seems
to have again become troublesome. On the 13th of De∣cember
1698, John Baillie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13. 15, 19. 1698.</NOTE> and six men more of the same
name, along with the wife of one of them, were indicted as
Egyptians, and also for sundry special misdeeds; and being
convicted, (all but the woman), they were ordered for execu∣tion.
But on this case, it is to be remarked, that the Court
had so far departed from the rigour of the statute, as not to
sustain a relevancy on the habit and repute of being an
Egyptian, of itself<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“They find their being called, holden, and repute Egyptianes, with one or other of the facts of pykeing and little theiving, relevant to infer the pain of death; and sustains the facts of pykeing or little theiving, relevant, <HI>per se,</HI> to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</P>
<P><HI>Verdict.</HI> “Find it proven, that John Baillie elder, &amp;c. are guilty of being called, holden, and repute Egyptians; and also finds it proven, that the haill forenamed pannells (except the said Margaret Baillie), are guilty of being art and part of pykeing and pettie theiving.”</P></NOTE>, but only along, “with one or other of
the facts of picking and little thieving,” libelled; thus re∣quiring
some proof of actual guilt in aid of the evil fame. In
these terms they were accordingly convicted. In the next
trial, which was that of William Baillie, June 26. 1699, a
still farther indulgence was introduced<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind the said William Baillie's being called, holden, and repute ane Egyptain, <HI>wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several</HI> of the facts, of pykeing or little theiving, or <HI>several</HI> acts of beating and striking with invasive weapons, relevant to infer the paines of death; and sustains the act of pykeing or little theiving, or beating and stri∣king, <HI>per se,</HI> relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>; for the interlocu∣tor
<PB N="342" REF="343"/>
required a proof not of <HI>one</HI> only, but of “<HI>several</HI> of the
facts of picking or little thieving, or of several acts of
beating and striking with invasive weapons.” He was only
convicted as an Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 27 and 28. 1699.</NOTE> and of <HI>one</HI> act of striking with an
invasive weapon; and he escaped, in consequence, with his
life.</P>
<P>THIS lenient course of dealing with the gypsies, was not
taken, however, from any opinion of it as a necessary thing;
nor was there any purpose of prescribing it as a rule for
other times, or for future cases of the kind, where such an in∣dulgence
might seem improper. As appears from the inter∣locutor
of relevancy in the case of John Kerr and Helen
Yorston<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the said pannels, or either of them, their breaking in upon the house of Pilmuir, &amp;c. or, <HI>separatim,</HI> the saids pannels, or either of them, their be∣ing sorners, by masterfully taking meat and drink of her Majesty's leiges with∣out paying therefor; or art and part of any of the said crimes, or, <HI>separatim,</HI> the saids pannels or either of them, their being called, known, habit and re∣pute to be Egyptians, relevant to infer the pain of death, and confiscation of moveables, and remit, &amp;c.”</NOTE>, and of William Baillie and other seven;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 19. 1714. Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> in both
of which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imple same and character▪ of being an Egyp∣tian,
is again found <HI>separatim</HI> relevant to infer the pains of
death<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And also, the Lords finds the saids pannels, or any of them, their being called, known, habit and repute Egyptians, relevant to infer the pain of death; but allows the saids pannels, or any of them, to adduce what legal evi∣dence they can, to prove they were reputed to be honest persons, and of no bad character. that the assize may be the better able to determine whether the saids pannels were really called, known, habit and repute, to be Egyp∣tians.”</NOTE>. Kerr and Yorston had a verdict in their favour.
Baillie and two of his associates were convicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 20. 1714. Aug. 10. &amp; 11. 1714.</NOTE> and con∣demned
to die; but as far as concerned Baillie, (for the
<PB N="343" REF="344"/>
others were executed), this doom was afterwards mitigated
into transportation, under pain of death in case of return.</P>
<P>As early as the month of August 1715,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials of Egyp∣tians.</NOTE> the same man (as
I understand it) was again indicted, not only for being found
in Britain, but for continuing his former practices and course
of life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 29. 1715.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this aggravation, the interlocutor
is again framed on the indulgent plan<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“September 6. 1715. Find the said pannels, or either of them, at the times and in the manner libelled, their having taken possession of a house belong∣ing to, &amp;c. and of an house called, &amp;c. and of another house belonging to, &amp;c. and when in the said houses, they or either of them their taking corn, straw, or hay for their horses without the consent of or paying the price therefor to the owners, and being habit and repute, and going under the designation of Egyptians, <HI>jointly,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death, and other pains libelled.</NOTE>; and only infers the
pain of death from the fame and character of being an Egyp∣tian,
joined with the various acts of violence and sorning, to
the number of three,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 8. &amp; 15. 1715.</NOTE> that are stated in the libel. Though
convicted nearly to the extent of the interlocutor, he again
escaped with transportaion.</P>
<P>NOR have I observed that the Court, in any later case,
have thought it necessary to proceed upon the repute alone,
unvouched by evidence of at least one act of theft or vio∣lence;
so that upon the whole, according to the practice of
later times, this sort of charge seems to be reduced nearly
to the level of the charge of being habite and repute a thief
at common law. Judgment was given to that effect up∣on
full debate in the case of Pinkerton and others<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“And also finds the saids David Pinkerton, <HI>alias</HI> Maxwell, John Marshall and Helen Baillie, <HI>alias</HI> Douglas, pannels, or any of them their being habit and repute to be Egyptians, sorners, or masterful beggars <HI>in conjunction</HI> with the said pannells, or any of them, their being the times and places libelled guilty art and part of the facts of violence, theft, robberie, or attempts of robberie, li∣belled, <HI>or any of the saids facts,</HI> relevant to infer the pain of death and confis∣cation of moveables.”</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16. &amp; 23. 1726.</NOTE> two of
<PB N="344" REF="345"/>
whom were hanged, and two transported; though even the
latter were convicted to an extent which, in terms of the in∣terlocutor
of relevancy, should have been sufficient to forfeit
their lives. The same course was held in the trials that
took place at Jedburgh, in 1731 and 1732; which seem to
be the last where any proper discussion of this sort of charge
can be said to have taken place. Thus, upon the whole, it
may seem to admit of doubt, whether by this long usage
of a lenient construction, and by reason of the better order
of the country, (which no longer requires the use of such
irregular expedients), the statute has not thus far been disarm∣ed;
and this point of dittay been reduced to be no otherwise
of a capital nature, than in the qualified and more reasonable
sense above explained. It is true, that the fame of being an
Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. and Nov. 12. 1751. Aug. 9. &amp; 13. 1770.</NOTE> was part of the <HI>charge</HI> in Wilson and Macdonald's
case; and in the case also of Macdonald and Jamieson. But
the interlocutor in both instances, was conceived in the ge∣neral
and ordinary terms, inferring <HI>the pains of law;</HI> and
a conviction followed of such facts which were capital of
themselves, without any regard to the character or habits of
the men.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the proof of such a charge (if ever it shall again
be the subject of a special inquiry):<NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessary Proof on this Sort of Charge.</NOTE> It will not be sufficient
to prove, in general, that the pannel is <HI>habite and repute</HI> a
sorner, vagabond, or thief; or that he is addicted to those
pilfering and vitious courses, which are common to Egyp∣tians
with other wandering and dissolute societies. The spe∣cial
opinion of him as an Egyptian, or one of a different breed
from the other inhabitants of this land, must be established;
<PB N="345" REF="346"/>
and this proceeding on those noted and peculiar circumstan∣ces
of manners and appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SORNING.</NOTE> by which, in all countries
that they have visited, this loose and lazy race have so re∣markably
been distinguished. Among these some of the chief
are the black eye and swarthy complexion,—a peculiar lan∣guage,
or gibberish intelligible only to themselves,—the
practice of palmistry and fortune-telling,—and the custom
of living (as far as the climate will permit), in solitary places
and in the open air<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie's Obs. on Stat. p. 333.—4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. ALONG with the crime of being an Egyptian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorning a great Oppression for∣merly in Scot∣land.</NOTE> we
may rank the kindred, and also capital offence of SOR∣NING;
being one of the many evil habits to which that
profligate and sturdy crew have every where been addict∣ed.
By sorning we understand the <HI>masterful</HI> taking of meat
and drink without payment; a thing which in the for∣mer
undisciplined situation of this country, (happily ve∣ry
remote from the present), those numerous bands of
dissolute and lawless people easily accomplished, more espe∣cially
in remote and solitary situations, where they chiefly
haunted, by the very terror of their looks and appearance,
and their known violent and vindictive temper. The state
of Scotland in this respect, if we may trust the description
that is given of the numbers and the manners of those va∣gabond
fraternities, by one who was able to judge and had op∣portunity
of knowing, was indeed such as we have now some
difficulty to imagine. Fletcher of Salton, in a treatise writ∣ten
in 1698, affirms that the numbers who lived as vagabonds,
even in ordinary times, (and in that year of dearth they were
double), amounted to at least a hundred thousand; who (he
<PB N="346" REF="347"/>
says) might be seen on all occasions of public meeting, both
men and women, perpetually drunk, cursing and blasphe∣ming,
and fighting together; who lived without any regard
or subjection either to the laws of the land, or even those
of God and nature; fathers incestuously accompanying
with their own daughters, the son with the mother, and the
brother with the sister; and of whom no Magistrate could
discover that ever they were baptized, or which way one
in a hundred of them died. “They are not only (says
he) a most unspeakable oppression to poor tenants, (who
if they give not bread or some kind of provision to per∣haps
forty such villains in one day, are sure to be insulted
by them), but they rob many poor people who live in
houses distant from any neighbourhood<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Second Discourse on the Affairs of Scotland, p. 145.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IN like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Sorning.</NOTE> the statute-book, in its numerous provi∣sions
against sorners, bears ample testimony to this intole∣rable
grievance. In some of these they are described as
“companies overlyand the King's lieges,” in others “as
overliers and masterful beggars with horse hounds and
other gudes,” or as those “that daily oppressis and
herryis the King's lieges:” And high pains are de∣nounced
against them as thieves and robbers; which in
effect they were. According to the laws of Robert II.
c. 12. offenders of this sort (there denominated <HI>Catherani</HI>),
and whom it describes as persons who passed through the
land, “<HI>comedendo patriam, et consumendo bona comitatuum, et
capiendo per vim et violentiam bona et victualia.</HI>” were to be
treated as fugitives and rebels; and might lawfully be kil∣led
on resistance, or refusal to surrender. The act 1449, c. 22.
<PB N="347" REF="348"/>
orders a sorner to be laid in irons, to lose an ear, and to be
banished, and in case of return to be hanged; and more di∣rectly
still, (though probably intended for the case of a
known and obstinate offender),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Make it a capi∣tal Crime.</NOTE> the act 1455, c. 45. orders
justice to be done upon a sorner “as upon a thiefe or
riever.” The rubric of this statute, in the first edition, or
black acts, is “<HI>of sorning</HI>” simply; in the later edition, in
three small volumes, it is in these words: “<HI>Sornares should
be punished to the death:</HI>” But whichever of these be the
correct reading, the appointed pain, being that of a thief <HI>or
riever,</HI> is the pain of death. And this is made still more
clear by the later statute 1477, c. 77.; which orders the
King's Justice to execute the law upon a common sorner
“as on a <HI>commoun</HI> thiefe or riever.”</P>
<P>A RELEVANCY seems to have been found to that effect, up∣on
a charge of sorning among other crimes, in the case of
the Macgibbons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 18. 1676.</NOTE> where the thing is libelled to have been
done in a hostile manner, and with convocation of the lie∣ges,
and arms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“They find the articles mentioned in the defence, relevant, in respect that it is libelled, that these deeds were done in a hostile manner, with convocation of the liedges in arms.”</NOTE>. And more expressly in the case of Kerr
and Yorston, which was not attended with any such ag∣gravation,
the crime of sorning, equally as that of being an
Egyptian, is found relevant to infer a capital conclusion.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Or, <HI>separatim,</HI> the saids pannels, or either of them, their being sorners, <HI>by masterfully taking meat and drink off her Majesty's leiges, without paying therefor;</HI> or art and part of any of the said crimes; or, <HI>separatim,</HI> the said pannels or either of them, their being called. known, habite and repute to be Egyptians, relevant to infer the pain of death, and consiscation of move∣ables.”</NOTE>.
<PB N="348" REF="349"/>
These pannels were however acquitted. Nor have I disco∣vered
any instance of death inflicted for sorning singly;
though along with other violences and oppressions to which
sorners were commonly addicted, it sometimes was the
ground of a capital sentence; as for instance in the foresaid
case of the Macgibbons.</P>
<P>THE proper description of sorning is the taking of meat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Crime.</NOTE>
drink, or victuals only, and not of free-quarters; though this
practice also, which indeed is a wrong of its own sort, has
sometimes been inaccurately added to the description of it
in indictments. But the interlocutor in the case of Kerr
and Yorston specially limits sorning to the kinds above men∣tioned.
And in the case of Baillie and Watson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> where this
objection had been started, the Lord Advocate in his infor∣mation
says, “as to the exacting of quarters without pay∣ing
therefor, the pursuer does not pretend that this is sor∣ning;
but it is a crime of its own nature, that deserves to
be punished.”</P>
<P>IN regard to the form of a libel for sorning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of a Li∣bel for sorning.</NOTE> Being a ge∣neric
offence, which does not stand upon a single deed, but
upon the repeated acts and habit of offending, which stamp
a character upon the man; it may, like others of that de∣scription,
admit a certain latitude in the way of charging the
particular articles and instances, from which that character
is to be made out. On the other part, to libel sorning quite
at large, without any specification of particulars, in the same
manner as the charge of being an Egyptian, this would be
unwarrantable; since there is not in the one as in the
other case, the authority of statute to sanctify so unusual
and so dangerous a form of process. It is true, the thing
was once permitted to be done,—in the case of the Mac∣gibbons,
<PB N="349" REF="350"/>
for the special reason, (it was said), that the sor∣ning
had been committed by those pannels in such an open
and hostile manner, as brought it near to a case of insurrec∣tion
and treason. But far from passing into a practice on that
account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27. and Aug. 7. 1714.</NOTE> this freedom was in the case of Watson and Baillie
refused to be allowed; and the charge of sorning found ir∣relevant
and dismissed for that very reason<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And the Lords find, that the said libel, not specifying any particular fact of sorning, is in that part thereof not relevant, and therefore repel the same.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER sort of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exacting of Blackmail.</NOTE> or felonious constraint,
which often went hand in hand with sorning, was the ex∣acting
of what was called blackmail, “<HI>firma nigra.</HI>”
This was a sort of ransom money, which was given to pro∣tect
the payer, his goods and effects, from theft and depre∣dation;
and is said to have been so denominated, in opposi∣tion
to “<HI>alba sirma,</HI>” or, “<HI>silver mail,</HI>” as being often paid
in copper and base-money, by poor and helpless people.
The thing itself, as well as the term, was well known, not
only in the highland parts of Scotland, but in the border coun∣ties
of both kingdoms; where the weak on either side of the
border put themselves under this sort of assurance to the pow∣erful
of the other, and sometimes of their own. Being a plain
encouragement to rapine, and a great obstacle to the course
of justice, even the paying of it was by statute 1567, c. 21.
(which proceeded on a proposition of the border counties),
made a capital crime. But I have not met with any in∣stance
of death inflicted even on the <HI>taker,</HI> much less on the
payer, for that sort of oppression singly. Along with other
enormities, nearly allied to it, and commonly practised by
the same persons, it might go to make up the capital charge:
<PB N="350" REF="351"/>
as it seems to have done in the case of James Gullan and
John Gray, two messengers at arms, concerning whom there
is this entry in the manuscript abridgment of the books of
adjournal. October 3. 1550, “<HI>Jacobus Guland, Johannes
Gray, convict. de captione et apprehensione Johannis Guttry, et
ab ipso proficua pro sua libertate recipiend. item de communi op∣pressione,

was also charged in the case of the Macgibbons, December
18. 1676.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, it will not be necessary to engage in a more
particular inquiry concerning the nature of this enormity,
which is now almost entirely unknown: Though the period
of our complete deliverance from it is not so distant, as from
the present state of things we should be led to conceive. No
longer ago than the months of June and May 1741, a bond
of blackmail was entered into between John Graham elder
and younger of Glengyle, and various landholders of the
counties of Perth, Stirling and Dumbarton; in which con∣tract,
Glengyle, in consideration of an annual payment of
L. 4 for every L. 100 of valued rent of the lands subscri∣bed
for, engages either to restore the cattle stolen from those
persons, within six months after intimation of the theft, (if
made to him with due dispatch), or to pay the value to the
owners. The asurance is, however, expressly covenanted
not to extend to the case of mere <HI>pickeries</HI> committed upon
the lands of the subscribers; and what shall be esteemed a
<HI>theft</HI> and not a <HI>pickery,</HI> is explained and settled thus: “De∣claring,
that one horse or black cattle stolen within or
<PB N="351" REF="352"/>

construed to be a <HI>theft</HI> and not <HI>pickery</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Signed by Bontein of Mildovan, Napier of Ballikinrain, Buchanan of Bal∣quhan, Buchanan of Glins, Wright of Easter Glins, Monteath of Kepp, Key of Edinbelly, Wright of Pouside, Robert Galbraith, portioner of Edinbelly, and Buchanan of Cremanan. It is printed entire in the Appendix.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IV. THE several classes of evil doers which have now been
mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Vagabonds.</NOTE> are all of them included under the more general
denomination of vagabonds; for our riddance of whom we
have a long succession of severe and anxious statutes, in pro∣portion
to the great need in which we formerly stood of a
relief from that sort of nuisance and oppression.</P>
<P>IN terms of those laws, there are to be held and treated as
vagabonds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1449, c. 22. 1457, c. 79. 1579, c. 74. 1592, c. 149.</NOTE> or masterful beggars,—all bards and jugglers, all
users of subtle crafty and unlawful plays, Egyptians, sor∣ners,
fenzeit fools, (pretended idiots, that is), counterfeit
deaf and dumb persons, fortune tellers, pretenders to know∣ledge
in charms, prophecy, or other abused sciences<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the case of Baillie, Watson and others, (July 27. August 7. 1714.) The
Court “Find the said pannels, or any of them, their being vagabonds, and ha∣ving

an arbitrary punishment.”</NOTE>; also
all minstrels, songsters, and tale-tellers, not being in the ser∣vice
of the Lords of Parliament, or the great burghs.</P>
<P>FOR this multifarous description of delinquents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Vagabonds.</NOTE> a great
variety of corrections have at different tims been appoint∣ed;
such as banishment, loss of the ears, being in the
King's will, and the like. But by the act 1579, c. 74.
which upon the whole seems to be the leading regulation,
<PB N="352" REF="353"/>
they are ordered to be laid in irons, and upon conviction by an
assize, to be scourged, and have their ears bored with a hot iron,
unless some one will find surety to take them into his service for
a year; from whom if they desert they are to be scourged and
again burned through the ear; and upon a second desertion
they are to be hanged as thieves. Beside these, there are many
other provisions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1579, c. 74. 1597, c. 272. 1617, c. 10. 1663, c. 16.</NOTE> both in the above and other statutes, (but
which have hardly been ever put in execution), for compel∣ling
both them and their children to serve for a term of
years, and even in some cases for life, either in public and
common works, or with such individuals as will take charge
of them. There are also two British statutes which may de∣serve
to be particularly taken notice of: the act of the
9. George II. c. 5. which punishes the pretending to exer∣cise
any sort of witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment or conju∣ration,
fortune-telling, or discovery of stolen goods, with a
year's imprisonment, and pillory once a-month; beside sure∣ty
for the person's good behaviour in future, if the Judge
shall see cause. The other is the act of the 4. Geo. I. c. 11.
which makes it lawful for a person, arrived at the age of
fifteen, to indent himself for transportation, and service in
any of the American colonies, for the term of eight years;
the contract being signed in the presence, and with the ap∣probation
of two Justices of Peace for the place where it
is made.</P>
<P>V. I SHALL now close this chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against harbouring Va∣gabonds.</NOTE> with a word or two
concerning the misdemeanour of keeping a house of harbour∣age
and entertainment for thieves and robbers, Egyptians,
and other such vagabond and disorderly persons, of whom
we have now been discoursing.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="354"/>
AGAINST this and other practices of the same pernicious
encouragement to the idle and worthless, we have many
sharp and severe enactments, especially relative to the High∣lands
and borders; and some which, being made for looser
times, when both the height of the disorder, and the weak∣ness
of Government, made recourse be had to violent and
excessive denunciations, might not now be thought proper,
(if indeed they ever were), to be put in execution. By one
in particular, the act 1567, c. 21. whoever intercommunes
with a thief within forty-eight hours before or after his
doing of a theft; or whoever shall within that time give him
food, harbourage, or assistance, either in his going to or co∣ming
from his theftuous deed, (and the act has not required
special proof of the assister's knowledge of the theftuous
purpose); is to be held art and part of the theft.</P>
<P>BUT independently of any of these statutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harbouring Thieves is a Crime at Com∣mon Law.</NOTE> or of special
comfort and privity as to any particular act of theft; the
earning a livelihood by keeping a known and peculiar house
of haunt and harbourage for persons of that loose and disor∣derly
description, is an offence which cannot be neglected
even of the common law: being in its very nature a nui∣sance
to the neighbourhood; a substantial though tacit asso∣ciation
with thieves in their trade, as well as a partici∣pation
of their gains; and a material, nay indispensable
assistance to them in their adventures, without which their
confederacy could not subsist, nor their business thrive nor
be carried on.</P>
<P>ON authority of the common law alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conviction at Common Law for harbouring Thieves. June 2. 1736.</NOTE> a libel was ac∣cordingly
raised for this, among other offences, against John
and Elizabeth Bell, in 1736. It sets forth in the preamble,
<PB N="354" REF="355"/>
“That where by the laws of God and the laws of this and
all other well governed realms, theft, or the reset of theft,
<HI>or the entertaining and assisting of common thieves, vagrant
persons, tinklers, Egyptians or vagabonds, or the keeping of a
house for a haunt and trysting place to such persons, and con∣cealing
them therein,</HI> and the assisting common thieves and
robbers to make their escape from the officers of the law:
As also, the outhounding and directing of common and
known thieves where to steal, are all and each of them
crimes of a high nature, and severely punishable, more
especially when the same are perpetrated and reiterated
by persons known habite and repute to be <HI>resetters and en∣tertainers
of common thieves, robbers, vagabounds, and vagrant
persons.”</HI> In the <HI>minor</HI> proposition, beside a direct charge
of breaking the shop of Francis Gibson, the libel sets forth
numerous instances of thieves repairing to the pannel's house
recently before or after the fact; and of stolen goods brought
thither; and of searches made, and criminals apprehend∣ed
there, and the like; and it concludes with charging, that
the pannels are habite and repute for harbourers of thieves.
The interlocutor of Court finds it relevant (<HI>inter alia</HI>)
to infer the pains of law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 1736.</NOTE> “The said pannels, or any of
them, their being <HI>habite and repute</HI> common thieves, or har∣bourers
of notorious thieves, or resetters of stolen goods,
joined with all or any of the facts charged against the
pannels, or any of them.” That is to say; the Court
would not punish upon the fame and repute by itself; but
only if it were supported with proof of one or more acts of
receiving evil company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 15. 1736.</NOTE> and the like. The jury found,
That the said pannels John and Elizabeth Bells were ha∣bite
and repute, and actually have been harbourers and en∣tertainers
of common and notorious thieves, vagabounds,
<PB N="355" REF="356"/>
tinkers and gypsies.” On this verdict they were banished
Scotland for life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1736.</NOTE> under pain of transportation in case of
return. It was argued in this case, for the prosecutor, (and
on that footing all the articles of the dittay were sustain∣ed,
though many of them were charged with a great latitude
in point of time and other circumstances), that in a libel for
this crime, there neither could nor needed to be as minute
and accurate a charge, as in the trial of the thief himself,
thus harboured and received, for any of the acts of theft there
mentioned. Upon such a dittay it is the use and habit, the
way of livelihood that is to be proved, as relative to a certain
course and period of time; and the particular facts of reset∣ting
are but as circumstances and <HI>indicia,</HI> or presumptions,
from which the pannel's trade is to be inferred.</P>

<P>I INTEND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIII.</NOTE> in this Chapter, briefly to take notice of some of
those offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piracy is a Crime against the law of Na∣tions.</NOTE> which are punished as injurious to the
interest of public trade.</P>
<P>THE principal of these, and in all cases a capital crime,
is that of Piracy, or roving and robbing on the seas; which
indeed is even to be considered as an offence against the law
of nations; being utterly destructive of the intercourse of
trade between one state and another. Hence in the law of
some countries, we find that pirates are described as <HI>beasts
of prey, sea-wolves,</HI> and <HI>foes of the human race.</HI> Hence also
the doubt, suggested in some authorities, whether any faith
is to be kept with pirates, or contracts of ransom and the
like to be observed with them; and hence the common
and established right of all men, without commission, to
<PB N="357" REF="358"/>
take their ships and reduce them to captivity<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Zouch de Jure Nautico; Molloy de Jure Maritimo, b. 1. c. 4.; Laws of Oleron, c. 47.; Coke 3. Inst. p. 113.; Laws and Inst. of Admiralty, vol. i. p. 225. 226.</NOTE> and even,<NOTE PLACE="marg">PIRACY.</NOTE> ac∣cording
to some authors, summarily to hang them up at the
main-yard, when overcome and taken at sea, if they cannot
easily and safely be carried to a place of lawful trial; nay,
it is said, even to do the same after arrival in a port, upon
refusal or delay of justice<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">MoHoy, b. 2. c. 4. No. 12. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>UPON this ground also it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piracy commit∣ted by or against Foreigners is pu∣nishable here.</NOTE> that, beside an empire over
the British seas, our Sovereign has an undoubted jurisdiction
and power, in concurrence with other Princes and States, for
the punishment of all piracies and robberies at sea, commit∣ted
in the most remote parts of the world<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Sir Charles Hedge's charge in case of Joseph Dawson, &amp;c. St. Tr. vol. 5. p. 3.; Grotius, lib. 2. c. 20. No. 40.; Case of Captain Green, March 1705.</NOTE> And for the same
reason, the commission of our Courts is no less unlimited
with respect to the persons by or against whom, than as to the
place where such depredations have been committed: so as
to punish the pirates of all countries<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Molloy, b. 2. c. 4. No. 9. 15.</NOTE> equally as those who
have their haunt or residence in Britain; and so as not only
to protect the denizens or inhabitants of the British realms,
and their property, or that of nations with whom we are in
special alliance; but equally that of all foreigners, whether
Europeans or of the other quarters of the world, and whe∣ther
Christians or of any other religious persuasion, with
<PB N="358" REF="359"/>
whom we are not at war, and are in the use of holding trade
and correspondence. For the suppression of pirates is a
matter of common interest to all nations that use the sea for
trade; and if each were only to consider the injuries sus∣tained
by their own people, or only to restrain the native pi∣rates
of their own realm, the opportunities of punishment
would happen but seldom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 8. &amp; 9. 1701.</NOTE> Thus, in England, William Kidd<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. No. 169.</NOTE>
and others, were convicted of piracy, committed in the
East Indies upon a vessel, the property of certain Armenian
merchants. In like manner with us, on the 3d July 1555,
Gilbert Stalfurde, and twenty-six others, had sentence of
death, being convicted, “de piratia et oppressione fact. su∣per
subditis, mercatoribus. supradict. nos. reginae, <HI>ac aliis
personis extraneis, sui regni amicis confederatis ad illud,”</HI> &amp;c.
In the case too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 8. 1610.</NOTE> of Peter Love and others, Englishmen, who
had sentence of death for piracy, the depredations seem to have
been chiefly upon the ships of other nations, English, Dutch,
and French. Again; on the 3d November 1624, Brown
elder and younger, and Dowie and Duff, had sentence of
death for an act of piracy, committed on a Spanish vessel,
which they ran away with on a voyage from St John's to
Calais, after throwing certain Spaniards, the owners, over∣board<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Records of Just.</NOTE>.
Likewise; in the case of Roger Hews and others,
tried in the Scots Court of Admiralty, on the 15th of Novem∣ber
1720, one of the charges sustained and sent to the assize,
was the seizing of a French sloop, in some distant latitude,
which is not particularly described. In the same case, that
some of the ships captured were British, or the ships of states
in alliance with Britain, is charged as an aggravation of the crime.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="360"/>
THE characteristic of a pirate, and that wherein he dif∣fers
from a regular enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirate is he who has no commis∣sion from any State.</NOTE> is, that he has no license or com∣mission
of hostility from any acknowledged state or govern∣ment,
(in which class those of Algiers and Tripoli have how∣ever
at last come to rank); but acts predoniously, and car∣ries
on a private and indiscriminate war, purely of his own
authority, and upon no principle but his pleasure. For even
between nations which are in a state of open war, and much
more between those which have only causes of complaint
for denial of justice to their subjects, or the like, there is no
permission of cruising and hostility to the private citizens
of either, against the other; in which course there could be
no security for observance of the rules of war, nor against
any sort of excess or irregularity. On the contrary, all such
adventures must be carried on under warrant of proper li∣censes
or commissions to arm; which are granted upon se∣curity
found to a certain effect, and oblige the persons who
receive them to bring in all captures entire, and without
breaking bulk, for condemnation in course of law, and di∣stribution
of the value according to the regulations for the
time. In short, by the very nature of civil society,
<HI>all em∣ployment
of force</HI> can only be by public authority; or in other
words, the power of the sword belongs exclusively to the
Prince; and except as far as delegated by him, cannot be
exercised by any individual or association of persons. Any
adventurer, therefore, who sails upon a voluntary and un∣licensed
warfare against the enemy, (for I do not speak of
an occasional combat between two trading vessels, neither of
them equipped to cruize, though even in that case the prize
would probably go to the King); and who condemns, distri∣butes,
or disposes of his prizes at sea, or elsewhere, by his
<PB N="360" REF="361"/>
own jurisdiction; is no other than a pirate, and if taken by
the enemy, may lawfully be dealt with as such<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Order of King and Council, February 3. 1694, containing directions to the commanders of King's ships, respecting privateers and pirates, Art. 6. “In case, upon your taking any privateer, <HI>that no commission be found,</HI> you are to cause all the prisoners be carried before a Magistrate so soon as they are brought on shore, with such witnesses as you shall think requisite, who can speak to the manner of the capture, and the identity of the prisoners; and that the ship ta∣ken was armed in like manner, and that thereupon all the prisoners <HI>be commit∣ted as pirates.</HI>” Bank. Inst. b. 2. tit. 2. §3.—Stair, b. 2. tit. 2. No. 4.—Molloy, b. 2. c. 4. No. 10.; says, he shall have judgment <HI>by martial law.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY a commission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is a Pirate who abuses a lawful commis∣sion.</NOTE> must here be understood such a one as the
bearer may properly hold. Hence, with respect to any com∣mission
held under a foreign power, by a native born subject
of Britain,—it is to be observed, that if the foreign power be
at open enmity with Britain, the using of any such commis∣sion,
and cruizing under it, is an act of treasonable adhe∣rence
to the King's enemies. If the foreign power is not at
open war with Britain, still the using of such a commission
for the purpose of depredation on British subjects, seems in
itself to be a piracy; for the man can have no lawful com∣mission
to cruize against his fellow subjects, and is therefore
to be judged, as if he were unprovided with any authority at
all.</P>
<P>FARTHER, under the name of commission, not every com∣mission
is here to be received, but such a one as autho∣rises
the bearer in the sort of hostility he has carried on, and
the things he has done. For though he have letters of
marque to cruize against the enemies of his Prince, or
though he be even in the naval service of his Prince; yet if
he do not act in pursuance of those letters, but under colour
of them, shall wilfully take and plunder the ships of his own
<PB N="361" REF="362"/>
country, or of countries which are at amity with his own,
and privately turn them to his profit, without any law∣ful
condemnation; certainly he can have no benefit, but
shall rather be prejudiced by that commission which he has
infringed and abused<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Molloy de Jur. Mar. b. 1. c. 2. No. 23.; c. 4. No. 2.</NOTE>; so that the ship shall be forfeited,
and the man be liable to punishment as a pirate. This is
clear law; and was the opinion of the Court in the case al∣ready
mentioned of Captain Kidd, who had a commission
from our King to cruize against the French, and another
for the taking of certain pirates; but turned pirate himself,
and plundered a Moorish vessel, under the affected and false
pretence of its being French property, or navigated under
a French pass. The same rule was applied in our Court of
Admiralty, upon the trial of Wilson Potts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 8. and Dec. 3. 4. 10. 1781.</NOTE> Captain of the
Dreadnought privateer of Newcastle; who under colour of
his commission to cruize against the French, Spaniards, and
Dutch, our enemies at the time, laid hold of a Danish vessel
in Balta Sound, in the islands of Shetland, and robbed it of
four bags of dollars, beside abusing the persons of the ma∣riners,
and laying them in irons. This man had sentence of
death, and was executed within flood-mark upon the sands
of Leith.</P>
<P>IT is, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But this is only true of gross and wilful abuse.</NOTE> only such acts of gross and intentional abuse,
that lay open the case to this construction. For though the
vessel turn out not to be a lawful prize; yet if it was seized
upon probable or excusable grounds, such as bearing flags of
different nations, or being navigated by foreign mariners, or
under suspicious clearances and passes; and if it was proceeded
with by the captors <HI>bona fide,</HI> and in regular course, for con∣demnation;
<PB N="362" REF="363"/>
the owners can have no criminal process, but
only a claim of damages and restitution at most<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Justices Treatise of the Laws of the Sea, p. 462. Molloy, b. 1. c. 2. No. 24.</NOTE>. In like
manner, owing to the defect of felonious purpose, it will not
amount to piracy, if the taking be from necessity, and of
those things only, such as provisions, sails, or cables, which
relieve the distress of the captors; and this upon payment
of the price, or obligation granted for it<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Laws of the Admiralty, vol. i. p. 228. Molloy, b. 2. c. 4. No. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PIRACY is committed by taking either the ship itself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Piracy to take either the Ship or the Ship or the Effects, or Persons in it.</NOTE> or the
effects that are in, it, or the persons on board, in order to sell
them for slaves; and equally whether the crew be on board
and are mastered, or are ashore, or in their boat at the time.
As also it seems in reason to be all one, whether the ship and
effects are run away with by strangers who invade it, or by
the mariners themselves on board the vessel; for they take
it out of the possession of the master or officer, by whom it
is held for the use and behoof of the owners<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In the English case of Joseph Dawson, William May and others, (Oct. 19. 1696), it was judged to be a piracy for part of the crew, with assistance of cer∣tain strangers, who came from another ship, to run away with the vessel. This was before the stat. 11th and 12th William III. c. 7. by which it is piracy for either master or mariner to run off with the vessel, or voluntarily to yield it up to a pi∣rate, or to conspire to do any of these things; as well as in sundry other cases. State Trials, vol. v.</NOTE>. This, accor∣dingly,
seems to have been the <HI>species facti</HI> in the case, al∣ready
mentioned, of Brown, Dowie and Duff, November 3.
1624.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="364"/>
BY the ancient practice, the trial of this crime was
equally within the cognisance of the Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jurisdiction in Cases of Piracy.</NOTE> and the Lord
High Admiral, and their respective deputes. Which in par∣ticular
appears from the trial of twenty-seven English pi∣rates
on July 3. 1555; where the Earl of Bothwell, Lord
High Admiral, appeared and protested for the sole trial of
such offences: But the Justice proceeded, and eleven of the
pannels had sentence of death. Peter Love, of Lewis in
Sussex, and other English pirates, to the number of eight,
were in like manner capitally convicted before the Justice,
on the 8th December 1610. The following are farther in∣stances
of conviction of piracy in the same Court: The
case of John Davidson and John Lewis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 2. 1613.</NOTE> sentenced to be
hanged for piracy committed in Yarmouth roads: The
case already quoted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 3. 1624.</NOTE> of Brown, Dowie and Duff; the case
of John Macrorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 1625.</NOTE> and eleven other Highlanders, order∣ed
to be hanged on the sands of Leith, within flood-mark,
on conviction (<HI>inter alia</HI>) of piracy done upon a Flemish vessel,
which had been stranded in the Sound of Mull. But this
concurrent jurisdiction of the Justice Court and that of the
Admiral, was put an end to by the statute 1681, c. 16. which
declares the High Admiral to be the King's Lieutenant
and Justice General in all maritime cases, criminal and civil,
and forbids all Judges to meddle with such trials in the first
instance. In this however, as in all other cases, the power
of review, in the form of suspension, remains, as of natural
right, with the Supreme Criminal Court of the country.</P>
<P>IN regard to the manner of the process.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of a Libel for Piracy.</NOTE> There seems to be
a good reason in the nature and circumstances of the offence,
for allowing a greater latitude in the charge of time and place,
and of the description of the things taken, than is ordinarily
<PB N="364" REF="365"/>
used in the libelling of crimes committed at land; of which
more accurate information, and by more credible witnesses,
can be obtained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1705.</NOTE> In the case, accordingly, of Captain Green,
where the vessel taken is no otherwise described than “as
bearing a red flag, and having English or Scots aboard,
at least such as spoke the English language,” an objec∣tion
of that kind was explicitly repelled<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Repels the objection against the generality of the indictment, in regard of the nature of the crime.”</NOTE>. In the case of
Roger Hews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 1720.</NOTE> one of the charges is even thus: It sets forth,
that the pirates failed to such a station “where they took
several ships belonging to Antigua, Liverpool, Barbadoes,
or some other places under subjection, or in alliance with
his Majesty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. &amp; Dec. 1781.</NOTE>” In the case too of Wilson Potts, the piracy
is charged to be committed “on the vessel called the
White Swan of Copenhagen, or having a certain name to
the prosecutor unknown, and which vessel was the property
of a certain person or persons, the subjects of the Crown
of Denmark, a neutral or friendly power.” <HI>Socii criminis,</HI>
too, are more especially necessary to be admitted in such
cases, as witnesses on the part of the prosecutor.</P>
<P>ON the other side;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compulision a good Plea against Charge of Pi∣racy.</NOTE> this seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be one of those crimes,
with respect to which the situation affords more sufficient
grounds than in most others, for sustaining the defence of
compulsion to the pannel; who may at first have been for∣ced
into the service, (being perhaps carried on board from
a prize), and afterwards detained in it owing to the want of
an opportunity of escaping, and the just fear of consequences
to his life and person, if he should refuse to concur. These
things, if proved <HI>idoneis argumentis,</HI> seem therefore to be
<PB N="365" REF="366"/>
a sufficient excuse of mere presence at least with the pira∣tical
crew, or assistance in navigating the vessel, or the
performance of ordinary services aboard: nay, even a
share in fighting the vessel may be excused on the same
ground; especially if joined to the preceding constraint,
there be proof of threats and compulsion employed against
the person at the time. In the case of Roger Hews and
others, such a defence was sustained by the interlocutor of
Court; and being found <HI>proven</HI> by the verdict in favour of
several of the pannels, they were in consequence assoilzied.
On this ground also, out of 165 pirates, who were tried by
special commission, in March and April 1722, at <HI>Cabo-corso
Castle,</HI> on the coast of Africa, for piracies committed in that
quarter of the world, seventy-four were acquitted<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fifty-two were hanged, twenty sentenced to seven years servitude on the coast of Africa, and the others respited, or referred to the Marshalsea. See trial of the pirates taken by Captain Chaloner Ogle, on board the Swallow man of war, on the coast of Guinea.—London, 1723.</NOTE>. It is
equally plain on the other side, that if the person continue
in the adventure when free to leave it, and receive his share
of the spoil; or if he accept a command in the ship, or be
otherwise active and forward in deeds of hostility; it will
not serve him to prove that his first engagement in the trade
was not of his own choice: for his conduct shows that he
afterwards freely assented to the piratical course of life.</P>
<P>OUR most noted trial for piracy in modern times is that
of Captain Green and others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 1705.</NOTE> a case of some interest and
curiosity in itself, but which attracted still more attention
than it was otherwise entitled to, owing to the discontents
and political complexion of the times. Green and thirteen
of his crew were convicted; but of the whole only three
su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered death according to their sentence: the others were
respited, and in the end received a pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="367"/>
II. THE plundering of stranded vessels, chiefly differs
from piracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plundering of wrecked Vessels.</NOTE> as it can only be committed on the shores of
the kingdom; and is not the act of known freebooters,
who have betaken themselves to robbery as a trade, but of
persons who are tempted by the unprotected situation, ge∣nerally
speaking, of the prize, and the present opportunity
of profit. Like piracy, it is however, an injurious act to the
interest of trade, and shows a hardened and rapacious dispo∣sition
in the offender.</P>
<P>IN the advancement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Law of Wrecks is ob∣solete.</NOTE> therefore, of policy and civilization,
the iniquity of the old <HI>law of wrecks</HI> has been gradually
done away; and many humane provisions been received
for the succour of the unfortunate owners. According to
the ordinance of Alexander II. entitled, <HI>de wrecto maris,</HI>
all wreck escheated to the King; but under this limitation,
(similar to that established in England in the time of Hen∣ry
I. and II.), that no vessel should be held a wreck, if
any living thing were found on board, <HI>“si illo inveniatur bo∣mo,
canis, vel murilegus vivens</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stat. Alex. II. c. 25.</NOTE> But even in this case the
owner lost his property, if he failed to make his claim with∣in
year and day. By statute 1429, c. 124. this rigour was
departed from, with respect to the vessels of those countries
which do not use “the law (as the act calls it) of broken
schippes in their awin lande;” and the same favour was
ordered to be shown them here, “as they keep to the schippes
of this land broken with them.” But, though not express∣ly
altered by any later statute, this political provision has
effectually been abrogated by the custom and decisions of
modern times; which sustain the claim of the owners, of any
<PB N="367" REF="368"/>
country, without regard to the lapse of year and day, and
whether any living thing be found on board or not.</P>
<P>ALL pretence of right in the first occupier of stranded
goods is thus excluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plundering of Wrecks is not a capital Crime.</NOTE> (and indeed it was so under the old law
of escheat to the King), even in the case of an absolute and
proper wreck. It is true, the plunderer cannot be pro∣secuted
as a thief, by reason of the open and unprotec∣ted
state in which he finds the spoil; yet still in seizing and
detaining that which is the right of another, he is guilty of
a wrong and dishonesty, such as is cognisable in a criminal
Court, and may be punished arbitrarily, according to the de∣gree
of the fault. It appears that in England, the common
law no farther accommodated the owners of the ship or
cargo, than by granting a commission at their request, to in∣quire
concerning the detainers of their property, and com∣pel
them to make restitution<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackstone, vol. i. p. 283.</NOTE>. To enlarge, therefore, this
very feeble protection, the Legislature interposed with a suc∣cession
of statutes; 12th Anne, stat. 2. c. 18.; 4th Geo. I.
c. 12.; 26th Geo. II. c. 19. in virtue of which, all the high∣er
offences of this sort are raised to the rank of felony
without benefit of clergy. But, by express provision of
the last of these statutes, it does not extend to Scotland;
and the same has been found, (though in a question only
as to other parts of their enactment); respecting the
two former; first by the Judge-Admiral, in the case of Sa∣muel
Lampro in 1751, and afterwards by the Court of Ju∣sticiary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. 1784.</NOTE>
in the case of Maciver and Macallum. Thus, there
does not seem to be any authority with us in Scotland, for
punishing the depredator of <HI>wrecks</HI> with death, how great
soever the excess to which he has gone.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="369"/>
BUT it is to be remembered, that no vessel is a <HI>wreck,</HI>
unless all on board have perished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But it is Robbe∣ry, to Plunder a Stranded Vessel under care of the People.</NOTE> As long, therefore,
as any human creature is in the vessel alive; or though all
on board have left the vessel, for the time, to save their
lives, yet if they continue their care and management of
the ship and cargo; it seems to be as much a stouthrief, or
masterful theft, to invade and pillage it, not withstanding
their resistance, or in their sight, or when anywise under
their protection, as in any other case of property that is
forced from the lawful possessors. For, from the nature of
the situation, any person on board who survives the calami∣ty,
and thus preserves the knowledge of the property of the
ship and cargo, is constituted keeper thereof, for behoof
of all concerned; and not only has right, but is in duty bound
to take all the necessary measures, in this their common
misfortune, towards the protection of their interest. Ac∣cordingly,
in our older practice, so much was this view ta∣ken
of the predonious invasion of a stranded vessel, that the
offenders were judged and executed as pirates; which in ef∣fect
they are as to the particular instance, though not as to
the habit or trade of the men. This appears from the case
of John Macrorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 2. 1625.</NOTE> and eleven others, who had sentence of
death, as pirates, for coming in boats and invading and plun∣dering
a Flemish vessel, (beside killing several of the crew),
which had been stranded in the Sound of Mull. This was
perhaps inaccurate, as far as related to the form of the
charge; but I see no reason to think, that the men had a
more severe judgment than their offence deserved, and would
have received, if it had been prosecuted in the competent
and proper form. The charge was accordingly laid as for
<HI>theft and robbery,</HI> in the case of Robert Graham, and others,
prosecuted before the Judge-Admiral, in March 1792, for
<PB N="369" REF="370"/>
pillaging a stranded vessel; and in these terms it was found
relevant and sent to an assize<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Certain informalities in the verdict and proceedings prevented sentence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. THE statute of the 4th of Geo. I. c. 12. (one of those
above mentioned),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilful Destruc∣tion of Ships.</NOTE> as also the statute 11th Geo. I. c. 29. made
provision likewise for the capital punishment of such who shall
wilfully cast away, burn, or otherwise destroy any vessel to
which he belongs, or in which he has an interest, with intent to
prejudice the underwriters of insurance thereon, or any mer∣chant
that has goods on board, or the owners themselves of
the vessel. In the above mentioned cases, of Lampro in
1751, and Maciver, &amp;c. in 1784, it was found that Scotland was
not within the operation of these enactments. As a gross and
most dangerous fraud, or falsehood, the execution of such
a plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14. 1751.</NOTE> was, however, in the case of James Macnair<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Finds that the said indictment or libel is not relevant to infer the pains of death, or the punishment enacted by the foresaid statute made in the eleventh year of the reign of his said late Majesty King George the First; but finds that the said indictment or libel is relevant by the common law to infer an arbitrary punishment.” Macnair was not convicted.</NOTE>, found
relevant by the Judge-Admiral to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment
at common law. The same was found by the Court
of Justiciary in the case of Maciver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arnot, p. 279.</NOTE> &amp;c. with respect even to
the contriving and attempting to perpetrate so deep a scheme
of villany.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 28. 29. 1784.</NOTE> Likewise, James Herdman, convicted in the
Court of Admiralty of sinking a vessel with this intent, had
sentence to stand in the pillory, and to be banished Scotland
<PB N="370" REF="371"/>
for life. But in the end, this course of punishment having
by experience been found too lenient to repress a practice,
which holds out such high temptations of gain to the un∣principled,
the benefit of the capital sanction was extended
to Scotland by statute, 29th Geo. III. c. 46.</P>

<P>1. AMONG the offences which have relation to trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SMUGGLING.</NOTE> we
cannot pass over that of Smuggling, or importing
goods from abroad without payment of the duties thereon im∣posed
by national authority, towards the aid of the public ser∣vice.
This trespass, which, in whatever shape committed, ex∣poses
the offender to pecuniary penalties and forfeiture of the
goods, has, in the higher and more audacious modes of it, been
found necessary to be repressed with chastisement of a higher
sort. And in this respect the law is marked with progressive se∣verity,
both as to the punishment and the description of the
crime, in proportion to the growing temptation and greater
frequency of such transgressions, through the increase of the
duties on importation, and the consequent higher profit of
evading them. I shall distinguish those enactments, which
are levelled against convocations of numbers, from those
which relate to the offences of single persons.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="373"/>
BY statute 6th Geo.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIV.</NOTE> I. c. 21. No. 34. it is punishable with
transportation for seven years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes Against Smuggling, 6th Geo. I. c. 21.</NOTE> if persons tumultuously as∣sembled
to the number of <HI>eight,</HI> and armed with club or any
manner of weapon, shall wound, beat, or forcibly hinder
any officer of the customs, or any person acting in assistance
of him, in the execution of his office. Upon this statute Ro∣bert
Shaw was convicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1. 2. 8. 1725.</NOTE> and had judgment, as art and part
of an assembly, who carried off a quantity of salt from a
cellar where it had been lodged by the tide-waiters; and also
bound the tide-waters themselves, put them on board a boat,
and carried them for some days, as prisoners, from place to
place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 27. and Mar. 7. &amp; 8. 1721.</NOTE> Jeremiah Keddy also had sentence in terms of this
statute; being one of a number, armed with staves and the like
weapons, who by threats of death and mischief, and prepa∣rations
to invade, but without actually offering any violence,
had hindered the officers to make seizure of a boat loaded
with brandy. It was pleaded for these pannels, that the
qualifications of violence set forth in the libel were not suf∣ficient:
but the answer was made, and was sustained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the saids pannels, or either of them, having, at the time and place libelled, in a tumultuous assembly, with others, to the number of eight or more persons, armed with clubs or other such weapons, forcibly hindered Arthur Stark complainer, in the due execution of his office, as having com∣mission from the Commissioners of Customs to that purpose, from seizing some brandy in quarter casks, or other goods prohibited to be imported, when the said complainer, with his assistants was in pursuit thereof, or the saids pannels or either of them was art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of the act libelled.”</NOTE>, that
the forcible hinderance, equally as the wounding or beating
of the officer, was the act described and forbidden in the
statute.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="374"/>
LIBEL was also raised, partly on this statute, and partly
at common law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials upon that Statute. Sept. 22. and Nov. 8. 1725.</NOTE> against Thomas Anderson and others, for vio∣lently
taking from the revenue-officers a quantity of soap, which
they had seized for his Majesty's use, and for beating and abu∣sing
the men themselves. Sundry pleas were entered for the
pannels, and especially these; that the officers had not duly
intimated that they were such, nor the purpose of their co∣ming;
that the libel did not describe the soap as foreign or
uncustomed goods; and that the officers had acted irregu∣larly
in making the seizure; in as much as they had entered
a house for that purpose, without <HI>a writ of assistance,</HI>
or the
presence of a peace-officer, as required by statute, 14th
Charles II. sess. 5. to which the act of George refers. These
objections were not without their weight; and the prosecu∣tor,
in the end, restricted his libel to a charge of assault
and riot as at common law. For it will be observed, (and
this was yielded on the part of the pannels), that though the
officers and their party fall into a mistake in the execu∣tion
of their duty; yet do they not in consequence become
straightway accountable to the populace, so as to be beaten
and abused at pleasure, but are to be dealt with ac∣cording
to their quality, and the opinion in which they
act, until they are themselves guilty of violence and excess<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The pannels are far from pretending, that an officer, or any other man, may be beaten and insulted, merely because he commits a mistake; no, the beating and insulting the officer, may still be criminal and punishable as a riot; but then it cannot be punished with the pains of this statute, <HI>sexto Georgii.</HI> And though the officers are not to be accountable to a mob for their mistakes, yet they are to be accountable to your Lordships whether they were in the due execution of their office or not.” <HI>Information for the pannels.</HI></NOTE>.
Accordingly, the interlocutor in this case sets forth both the
general rule in that respect, and the provision under which
<PB N="374" REF="375"/>
it is to be received: It likewise announces this position, that
it is punishable at common law to carry off goods from the
revenue officer, who is in the possession of them; even
though this be done without any injury to the person of the
man<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds the saids pannels or any of them violently invading at the time and place libelled, the officers of the customs mentioned in the libel, or any of them, or the beating bruising or wounding any of them, or being art and part there∣of, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment; but for eliding thereof, sustains the defences offered, viz. That the said officers, or some of them, did commit acts of violence against the defenders, by whipping or siring a pistol at some of them before the said officers were invaded as asoresaid; and <HI>separatim</HI> find the defenders or any of them, at the time and place libelled, carrying away the goods libelled, or any part of the same, after they were in possession of the Customhouse officers, or any of them, relevant to infer an arbitrary punish∣ment.”</NOTE></P>
<P>THE next statute upon this matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 8th Geo. I. c. 18.</NOTE> is the 8th Geo. I. c. 18.
which (in No. 6.) appoints the punishment of transportation
for seven years, for those persons who shall pass from the coast,
or within <HI>twenty</HI> miles of it, with goods smuggled from any
ship or vessel, if they be more than <HI>five</HI> in company; <HI>or</HI> carry
any offensive arms or weapons; <HI>or</HI> wear any vizard, mask,
or other disguise; <HI>or</HI> forcibly resist or hinder any officer of
customs or excise in the seizure of such goods. A libel, laid
upon this act, was found relevant to infer the pains of law,
against Chalmers and Yorstoun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. &amp; 29. and Aug. 1. 1751.</NOTE> who were charged as pas∣sing
with run goods, to the number of more than five in com∣pany;
one of whom had struck the revenue-officer with a
hammer.</P>
<P>UNDER this enactment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 9th Geo. II. c. 35.</NOTE> the actual passing with smuggled
goods was necessary towards conviction. But this was taken
<PB N="375" REF="376"/>
away by statute 9th George II. c. 35. No. 10. which orders
sentence of transportation for seven years, upon proof that
persons to the number of <HI>three,</HI> and armed with fire-arms, or
other offensive arms and weapons, <HI>have been assembled</HI> in
order to be aiding in the running, landing, rescuing, or car∣rying
away of uncustomed or prohibited goods.</P>
<P>BY another clause of the same statute, (No. 13.) the pains
of the statute 8th George I. c. 18. are applied to persons, as∣sembled
to the number of <HI>two</HI> or more, and passing within <HI>five</HI>
miles from the coast, or from any navigable river; if they
are conveying uncustomed goods of a certain specified quan∣tity
and value, upon carts or horses, and are otherwise in
any of the predicaments described by the said statute of the
8th.</P>
<P>A FARTHER step was taken by statute 19th George II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 19th Geo. II. c. 34.</NOTE>
c. 34. which aggravates the punishment, and makes it capital
for persons to the number of <HI>three, and</HI> armed with fire∣arms,
or other offensive weapons, <HI>to be assembled</HI> in order
to be aiding in the exportation of wool, or other goods not
allowed to be exported; <HI>or</HI> in the running, landing, or carry∣ing
away of prohibited or uncustomed goods; <HI>or</HI> in the re∣landing
of goods which have been shipped on debenture for
exportation; <HI>or</HI> in the rescuing of the same after seizure from
any officer of his Majesty's revenue; <HI>or</HI> in the rescuing or
hindering to apprehend any person who has been guilty of
any of the above offences.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly upon this last statute that prosecutions for
deforcement of the revenue officers, have of late years been
brought. In cases, however, not of a very flagrant nature, it
has been usual for the prosecutor to restrict his conclusions
to an arbitrary punishment: As was done in the case of John
<PB N="376" REF="377"/>
Stevenson, March 10. 1755, who had a verdict in his fa∣vour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1. &amp; 2. 1754.</NOTE>
and in that of Mackirdy and Hamilton, who were
convicted, and adjudged to be transported for life. In the
case of Carson and others, January 20. 1752, the libel, as laid
on the statute, and not restricted, was found relevant to in∣fer
the <HI>pains of law;</HI> but the pannels were acquitted by the
jury. Prosecution was also brought on this statute against
William Limond and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 12. &amp; 13. 1791.</NOTE> and against James Brown and
others; but these pannels were in like manner acquitted.</P>
<P>IN terms of the said statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 24th Geo. 11. c. 40. No. 28.</NOTE> it is a requisite qualification
of the capital charge, that the persons assembled have been
armed with fire-arms or offensive weapons. But under the
statute 24th George II. c. 40. (one of the latest which relates
to offences done by persons in company), it is punishable
with transportation for seven years, if persons to the number
of <HI>five</HI> (and the statute does not distinguish whether they be
armed or not), shall be <HI>tumultuously assembled,</HI> in order forcibly
to oppose the execution of the powers respecting spirituous
liquors bestowed by that act; or to rescue any offender against
that or any former act relative to spirituous liquors, or for
licensing retailers thereof; or to assault or beat any person
who shall have informed or born evidence against, or have
brought to justice, any person so offending.</P>
<P>IN regard to offences of this class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offences done by single Persons.</NOTE> which may be commit∣ted
by an individual, being alone, the like progressive seve∣rity
of the law may equally be remarked.</P>
<P>BY statute 8th George I. c. 18. No. 25.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 8th Geo. 1. c. 18.</NOTE> any person who
hinders or obstructs an officer of customs or excise, in the
seizure of spirits, either British or foreign, or of any foreign
<PB N="377" REF="378"/>
exciseable liquors, or who rescues, staves or destroys, or
attempts to stave or destroy, after seizure, any vessel con∣taining
such liquors, is punishable with a fine of L. 40.
Hog and Bryson were prosecuted on this statute in 1730,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22. &amp; 29. July 7. &amp; 15.</NOTE> for
assaulting the revenue-officers, in order to rescue a seizure of
brandy; and here the like debate arose, as in the case of
Thomas Anderson, concerning the effect of an alleged irregu∣larity
on the part of the officer, in entering a house to make
a seizure, without the presence of a constable. There was,
however, this other circumstance in the case, unfavourable to
the pannels,—That the officers had been for some hours in the
peaceable possession of the brandy, and were only invaded af∣ter
they had moved the casks from the house where they were
seized, and when in the course of conveying them to the
King's cellars. This interval seems to have been held suffi∣cient
to deprive the pannels of all right to a summary reco∣very
of their possession. For the libel was found relevant as
laid;<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Lords find the pannels, or either of them, their having time and place libelled, violently invaded the complainer Mr William Smith, or his as∣sistants, after they were in the possession of the seized goods libelled, <HI>by carry∣ing them in carts from the place where they had seized them,</HI> and that by beat∣ing, bruising, or wounding the said complainer, or any of his assistants, or their being guilty art and part thereof, relevant to infer the pains of law.”</NOTE> and Bryson being convicted, had sentence in terms
of the statute. Hog also was convicted; and was fined in
L. 20.</P>
<P>BY the words of another clause (No. 6.) of the same sta∣tute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 8th Geo. 1. c. 18.</NOTE>
it seems to be punishable with transportation, for even
a single person to pass from the coast, or within twenty miles
of it, with uncustomed goods landed from any vessel; if he
shall forcibly resist or hinder the officers of customs or excise,
<PB N="378" REF="379"/>
attempting to make seizure of such goods: for that circum∣stance
raises the guilt as high as in the case of an assembly
to the number of <HI>five;</HI> which is punishable in that way un∣der
the same clause, as already quoted.</P>
<P>BY statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 19th Geo. 11. c. 34.</NOTE> 19th Geo. 11 c. 34. No. 1. (the same which
first applied a capital punishment to smuggling by companies
of people), it is farther made a capital offence for <HI>any person</HI>
to pass with prohibited or uncustomed goods, if he have his
face blacked, or wear any vizard, mask, or other disguise;
as it also is for any person to main or dangerously wound
any officer of the customs or excise, when attempting to
go on board any vessel within the limits of a port; or to
maim, dangerously wound, or shoot at him, when on board
such vessel, and in the execution of his duty. By the words
of the latter part of the same clause, it seems even to be made
a capital offence, to be passing with prohibited or uncustomed
goods, and forcibly to hinder or obstruct the officers of cus∣toms
or excise in the attempt to seize them; and this without
regard to the circumstances mentioned in the beginning of
that clause, of persons being assembled to the number of <HI>three and</HI>
armed with fire-arms, or other offensive weapons. But,
though favoured by the words of the act, this construction
seems to be liable to very weighty objections; not only on
account of the excessive severity of such a law, but by rea∣son
of the want of all proportion (if this construction be
followed) in the punishments of the several offences created
by the statute; which in themselves are of very different de∣grees.
This matter was debated in the case of William
Mein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 25. and Aug. 1. 1751.</NOTE> whom the libel charged as passing with run goods,
and assaulting the revenue-officer, being in company with
persons to the number of three or more; but who were not
<PB N="379" REF="380"/>
described as armed with fire-arms or other offensive wea∣pons.
The result was, that after full debate the prosecutor
passed from his charge <HI>simpliciter,</HI> as far as concerned this
pannel.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this point may be settled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 24th Geo. III. c. 47.</NOTE> it is certain that by
statute 24th Geo. III. c. 47. it is a capital crime for any
person on the shore, or on board any vessel, maliciously to <HI>shoot
at any vessel</HI> of the navy, or in the service of the customs or
excise, within the limits of a port, or within four leagues of
the coast; or maliciously to wound or <HI>shoot at any officer of
the navy, customs or excise,</HI> acting in the execution of his duty;
which last seems to be enacted generally, without regard to
the situation, (that is whether he be on board or on shore),
where such injury is attempted.</P>
<P>To secure the punishment of offenders acting in this sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 19th Geo. III. c. 69.</NOTE>
the statute of the 19th Geo. III. c. 69. No. 10. empowers
the revenue-officer, who is assaulted or obstructed in seizing
prohibited goods, or in case of any attempt to rescue such
goods after seizure, himself to apprehend the culprit, and
carry him before a Justice of the Peace. He has the like
authority (by No. 9.) with respect to persons passing, to the
number of <HI>two</HI> or more, with horses or carts, loaded with
tea or foreign spirituous liquors, if they shall carry offensive
arms, or wear any vizard or disguise.</P>
<P>LAST of all; it is to be remembered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assault of a Re∣venue-officer is Crime at Com∣mon law.</NOTE> that when any branch
of revenue is created by statute, it is thenceforthe a genuine
public property, which equally as the property of any in∣dividual
is entitled to the protection of the law; so that to
assault the public officers, who are entrusted by his Majesty
<PB N="380" REF="381"/>
with the collection of it, is a high offence, and severely punish∣able
without any aid of statute. The common law, therefore,
as well as the special statute, is in use to be set forth in eve∣ry
libel for deforcement, or beating of a revenue-officer;
and in the case of James Caithness and Thomas Bisset, where
the libel was laid at common law only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 1. 1788.</NOTE> the objection to
that form of charge was repelled upon mature delibera∣tion.</P>
<P>IT is another consequence of the same principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And cognisable in the Court of Justiciary.</NOTE> that on
the passing of any revenue law, there arises a jurisdiction to
the Court of Justiciary, for the punishment of all assaults
committed in violation of it; unless the act itself has remit∣ted
the cognisance of such offences to some other Court. In the
case of Thomas Anderson and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 22. and Nov. 8. 1725.</NOTE> an objection was taken
to the charge on account of the following clause of the sta∣tute
libelled, (6th Geo. I. c. 21.), which was alleged to
commit the trial of such assaults to the Court of Ex∣chequer:
“And be it further enacted by the authority afore∣said,
That the several <HI>offences</HI> in this act mentioned, rela∣ting
to the customs or other duties upon importation or
exportation, or to uncustomed or prohibited goods, (ex∣cept
as in this act is otherwise provided), shall and may
be heard, tried and determined by bill, plaint or infor∣mation,
in any of his Majesty's Court of Record at West∣minister,
or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, re∣spectively.”
It was answered, that this clause did not
relate to the criminal offence of assaulting or beating, but
only to the civil offences, punishable with pecuniary penalties:
or at the most, that it only gave the Court of Exchequer a
cumulative jurisdiction, along with other Courts. The decli∣nator
was accordingly repelled. The like objection was
<PB N="381" REF="382"/>
moved, and had the like fate, in the case of Chalmers and
Yorstoun; as far as the libel was laid on the act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29. 1751.</NOTE> 8th Geo. I.
c. 18. which appoints the <HI>penalties and forfeitures</HI> thereby in∣troduced,
to be pursued for in the Court of Exchequer.</P>
<P>II. THE Legislature have been no less careful to guard that
valuable interest which the nation has in the skill and indus∣try
of its artisans and mechanics,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seduction of Artisans to go abroad.</NOTE> by severe provisions against
such who shall entice them to desert their native country,
and settle abroad. By statute 23d Geo. II. c. 13. the sedu∣cer,
for the first offence, is liable to a fine of L. 500, and
imprisonment for a year, on account of each artificer con∣tracted
with to be sent abroad; and for the second offence
to a fine of L. 1000, and imprisonment for two years. By a
former statute, the artificer himself, if he has gone abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Geo. I. c. 27.</NOTE>
and does not return within six months, after warning by the
British Ambassador, is liable to the only penalties which the
nature of his situation admits; viz. Forfeiture of lands and
goods, the incapacity of gift or legacy, and the loss of all
his rights and privileges as a British subject, in the same
manner as if he were an alien born. I have found but one
instance of prosecution for this offence; the case of Robert
Cresswell, who was fugitate upon such a charge, on the 10th
February 1766.</P>

<P>THERE is another crime against public trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXV.</NOTE> which
will require a particular examination, that of Usu∣ry;
which is the stipulating or exacting of an unlawful re∣turn,
or rate of interest, upon the loan of money. For with
respect to this commodity, contrary to the rule which is ob∣served
in other cases, it has not been thought proper to leave
men at freedom to six the terms of their contract as they
please; but to regulate the conditions of their transaction by
public authority, and set a bounds to the profit of the creditor.
A provision of this sort at once answers the double purpose
of protecting the needy borrower from oppression; and of
guarding the greedy and unconscientious lender against the
temptation of a high premium, which might induce him to
trust his money in the hands of rash and visionary adven∣turers,
who ought not to be encouraged.</P>

or whereby there shall be reserved or taken above
the rate of L. 5 in the hundred, as aforesaid, shall be ut∣terly void.”
In terms of this clause, the bond or con∣tract
is vitiated by the bare stipulation of an usurious profit;
though nothing have been paid or received in pursuance of
the engagement. Also, it has been holden, that under these
words, “<HI>whereupon or whereby,</HI>” employed in the act, the
nullity equally attaches to two different situations of the
contract. The word <HI>whereupon,</HI> is understood to relate to the
case of an open and direct stipulation, (which will not often
be inserted), of an usurious rate of interest, such as six or
seven <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the sum written in the contract; and
the word <HI>whereby,</HI> relates to that of a false and simulate
contrivance, whereby, in effect, though not upon the face
of the contract, the like stipulation is made. As if upon a
loan of L. 100, a bond is taken for L. 120, with interest for
that sum at 5 <HI>per cent.;</HI> which is in truth a stipulation of 6 <HI>per∣cent.</HI>
upon the sum which has actually been advanced: or if
at executing a bond for L. 100, payable at the distance of a
year, L. 5 is agreed to be retained as a year's interest; for
in this way, the bond relates a falsehood, and the real bar∣gain
<PB N="384" REF="385"/>
gain is equal to a stipulation of L. 5, for the use of L. 95 for
a year.</P>
<P>FARTHER;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute reaches all indirect De∣vices.</NOTE> in the construction of this statute, it is held to
be immaterial, whether the principal and usurious interest
are secured by the same, or by different deeds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkin's, b. 1. c. 82. No. 21.</NOTE>; if they be
plain parts and confirmations of one corrupt bargain and
agreement. And so it had been held in questions also under
the Scottish statutes. For one of the articles found relevant
against William Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. 1667.</NOTE> and on which he was convic∣ted,
and suffered escheat of moveables, (having, however,
received the usurious profit), was a charge of lending 5000
merks on wadset, and taking a separate bond of annual pen∣sion
for 200 merks, so as to raise the interest to 10 <HI>per cent.</HI>
Neither will it make any difference in favour of the lender,
that the contract is lawful in its stipulations of money; if it
assure him over and above of the furnishing of any other
thing or commodity, such as grain, meal, grazing of cattle,
or the like, which has a known and substantial value. Nay,
it will not even save the lender, though, as upon the face of
the contract, the stipulation should not be of interest, but in
a quite different shape; if it be truly intended in defraud of
the law. As if the debtor, in the bond which he gives for
the money, or in another deed of the same date, and rela∣tive
to it, lets the creditor a house for a rent corresponding
to the lawful interest of the sum lent, but much lower than
the just and accustomed rent of that tenement; and authorises
him to retain the rent in payment of the interest of his loan.
This is the opinion of Hawkin's on the act of Anne<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">B. 1. c. 82. No. 22.</NOTE> and
to the same effect, our Judges had decided in the case of
<PB N="385" REF="386"/>
Hugh Craig, of the 24th November 1668. This article,
among others, was there found relevant; that in the bond
for the loan, and in order to cover the usury, the lender
had taken a tack of two booths or shops from his debtor, at
the rent of L. 100 Scots, to be annually retained in pay∣ment
of the interest, and with a clause of relief from all
stents and public burdens; which shops had always rented
at L. 153 Scots, and were subset by the pannel at eight score
pounds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Justices finds the defence and duply relevantly proponed against the dittay, and repels the answers made thereto; but finds if it was communed betwixt the parties, the time of the setting of the tack, that considering that the two booths did formerly pay a greater duty nor the annualrent of the mo∣ney, and that <HI>intuitu</HI> and satisfaction of more annualrent nor is allowed by the law, the tack was set, relevant, and ordains the same to pass to the knowledge of an assize.”</NOTE>. Nor is the case of Robert Lauder to be consider∣ed
as an authority on the other side; though as related by
Mackenzie<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Tit Usury, No. 4.</NOTE>, it might seem to be so. But his account of the
case is thus far erroneous, that the tack was let for security
of the principal sum as well as interest, and bore a clause
for imputation of the creditor's receipts against both. In∣deed
several devices of this sort, as by letting back-tacks of
wadset lands for high duties, or by simulate sales of victual,
under high penalties in case of failure to deliver at a certain
day, are described and specially forbidden in the Scots act,
1597, c. 251.; which, as far as it is not contradictory of the
statute of Anne, but in the like strain with it, and calcula∣ted
for the same end, still continues to be in force; and af∣fords
an argument towards expounding of the latter, in its
application to the Scottish practice.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="387"/>
THE other provision of the act of Anne, was made to meet
the case of an instrument of debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute of Anne, as to Payment of usurious Interest.</NOTE> in itself fair and lawful,
but followed with the actual taking and receiving of an
usurious profit, in virtue of some separate and later settle∣ment,
or upon a verbal or understood agreement. The con∣sequence
is declared thus: “And that all and every person
or persons whatsoever which shall take, accept and receive
by way of means of any corrupt bargain, loan, exchange,
cherizance, shift, or interest of any wares, merchandizes, or
other thing or things whatsoever, or by any deceitful way
or means, or by any covin, engine, or deceitful conveyance,
for the forbearing or giving day of payment for one
whole year, of and for their money or other thing, above
the sum of five pounds for the forbearing of one hundred
pounds for a year, and so after that rate for a greater and
lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter term, shall forfeit
and lose for every such offence the treble value of the
monies, wares, merchandizes, and other things so lent,
bargained, exchanged or shifted.” If therefore a bond
stipulate 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> but the parties settle accounts at the rate
of 6 <HI>per cent.</HI> the treble penalties are due; but the bond is a
ground of action nevertheless, and the creditor shall equal∣ly
have decree for the contents, as the King for the statu∣tory
penalties<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 82. No. 12.</NOTE>. In the case of Cohoun and Dun, decided in
the Court of Session,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. 1790.</NOTE> action was accordingly sustained for
payment of a bond bearing interest <HI>at</HI> 5 per cent. <HI>but upon</HI>
which usurious profits had been taken. If, on the contrary,
an unlawful rate of interest has been stipulated in the instru∣ment,
as well as received in pursuance of it, the case falls
under both clauses of the statute; and the debtor has not
<PB N="387" REF="388"/>
only his acquittance of the debt, but he may pursue for his
moiety of the treble penalties too.</P>
<P>IF,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Receipt of usurious Interest not in Money.</NOTE> in the construction of this sort of charge, we shall fol∣low
the same rules which governed our ancient practice, and
which seem not to be unreasonable in themselves; it will in
this question also be reckoned immaterial, whether the usu∣rious
profit be received in money, or in other kinds. It was
found relevant against John Williamson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4 &amp; 5. 1665.</NOTE> that he had taken,
1st, a boll of bear and a boll of meal, besides L. 3 in mo∣ney,
over the just interest of a certain debt; 2dly, a boll of
bear, over the interest, for half a year's loan of 100 merks;
3dly, a boll of meal, worth 10 merks, for six weeks loan of
100 merks; 4thly, upon a loan of 200 merks, that he had
taken the grazing of twenty lambs, equal to L. 10, over the
interest<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Justice-depute sustains the haill fyve articles of the dittay relevant, and ordains the same to be put to ane assize.”</NOTE>. On the 1st June 1666, James Harper was in like
manner remitted to an assize upon a charge, <HI>inter alia,</HI> of
taking L. 13 Scots, and three loads of coal, and candle, be∣side
the lawful interest of his debt<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“The Justice-depute, notwithstanding of the defence, ordaines the dittay to be put to the knowledge of ane assize, and to be proven by witnesses, albeit not insert in the wreit.”</NOTE> By parity of reason,
all premiums allowed and paid, either upon the original loan,
or for continuing the money with the debtor afterwards,
are substantially the same thing as the receipt of usurious
interest; and will be judged as devices to elude the statutes.
This was held to be law in the said case of James Harper;
where another of the charges which were remitted to the
<PB N="388" REF="389"/>
assize, was the receiving of lambs, hogs, wool, and cheese,
from the debtor, as a consideration, over the interest, for con∣tinuing
the loan of the money. To make out a charge in
either of these kinds, it is, however, necessary, that the thing
be rendered upon some agreement of the parties, either ex∣press
or understood; and not in the way of free offering or gra∣tuity
on the part of the debtor. Whether for want of evi∣dence
in this particular, or for some other reason, both Har∣per
and Williamson were acquitted.</P>
<P>How broad soever this construction of the statutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alternative Sti∣pulations of far∣ther Interest.</NOTE> it can∣not
reach those stipulations, which are not direct for pay∣ment
of some unlawful profit, absolutely, in name of inte∣rest;
but of an alternative or provisional nature, for some ad∣ditional
or commuted consideration, in case the lawful in∣terest
shall not be punctually rendered. As, if upon an an∣nualrent
of grain, the creditor shall stipulate a certain high
commuted price, for every boll that shall not be delivered
at a certain day; or, as in our ordinary bonds of borrowed
money, which bear <HI>a termly failzie,</HI> (as it is called,) or stipu∣lation
of a certain sum upon failure of punctual payment of
each term's interest. In either of these cases, the debtor
has it in his power to avoid the higher obligation by due
performance of the lower; and the stipulation is not pro∣perly
of interest for the use of the sum, but of damages or
costs for failure to pay the interest; and which if excessive or
unconscionable may be subject to retrenchment by the Judge.
The advantage in such a case arises from the debtor's negli∣gence,
and not from his use of the money<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">At at a time when the lawful interest was 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> (by a temporary statute), a person having lent money at four, but stipulated 6 <HI>per cent.</HI> in case of failure to pay within a month after the term, this, under the same notion of damages, was held by the Civil Court to be a lawful and actionable bargain, July 23. 1679, Patrick Murray against Bank of Scotland. This, however, seems to be a questionable judgment.</NOTE>. In the trial, accor∣dingly,
<PB N="389" REF="390"/>
of Skene of Hallyards, who, upon an annualrent of
victual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. 1672.</NOTE> had stipulated a conversion of L. 10 for every boll
that should not be delivered by a certain day; this, as well
as the other articles of charge, was found to be no suffi∣cient
ground of process<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Repels the libel, answers and duplies, in respect of the allegeance, reply and triply, and finds no process.”</NOTE>. Of all contracts in this shape
it is however to be observed, that if from circumstances
they can be be shown to have been from the first intend∣ed
as covers for the stipulation of the high rate of in∣terest,
which and no other was ever meant to be taken;
they will then be judged according to their real object,
how speciously soever they may be disguised.</P>
<P>ANOTHER class of bargains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargains of Ha∣zard are not u∣surious.</NOTE> to which, according to the course
of either Scots of English practice, the penalties of usury
will not apply, are those wherein the lender runs a hazard of
losing his principal sum. Under this exception fall all loans
upon bottomry, or at <HI>respondentia</HI> or the like, which depend
on uncertain events, as to the payment of both principal and
interest; neither have the statutes any relation to the prin∣ciple
of such a transaction as a grant of annuity upon lives,
where the stock is sunk and given away, as the price of an
annual income, for a limited but uncertain term. The same
is true of all those modes of bargain, by which a present
sum is given for return of another sum or sums in a certain
event; as if John shall give James L. 50, to receive L. 100
<PB N="390" REF="391"/>
whensover James shall marry, and otherwise to receive no∣thing.
As unconscionable, and in some instances as immo∣ral
and of evil example, such bargains may be liable to be
set aside; but they are beyond the reach of the law of usury,
not being loans for stated profit, but pure wagers or bar∣gains
of chance, whereof the advantage may turn to either
side<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See July 13. 1745, Abercromby <HI>contra</HI> Earl Peterborough; and Sir Wil∣liam Maxwell <HI>contra</HI> Pringle, July 9. 1760.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH respect to a bargain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargains where the Interest is at Hazard.</NOTE> by which the interest only,
and not the principal sum is at hazard,—it seems to be the
rule of the law of England, that this does not hinder the
high rate of interest to be usurious. But in this their prac∣tice
is at variance with the known tenor of our custom re∣specting
proper wadsets; according to which it has always
been lawful for the creditor to receive a pledge of land more
than equivalent, in common years, to the interest of his mo∣ney;
provided he be subject to the hazard of the fruits and
rents of the tenement impledged, and thus in bad years, or
by the failure of tenants or otherwise, run the risk of losing
his interest. The provision of the statute 1661, c. 62. con∣cerning
usurious wadsets, is limited, accordingly, to the op∣posite
case, of the wadsetter being relieved of all such ha∣zard.
Nor does the act 1597, c. 251. contain any general
declaration to the contrary; but only a special provision for
the case of a back-tack of the wadset lands, given at a rent ex∣ceeding
the interest of the debt<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Mackenzie, Tit. Usury, No. 4. Dict. Decis. vol. ii. <HI>voce</HI> Usury.</NOTE>. In regard to annualrents
of grain, which, by the variation of the price of that com∣modity,
might give rise to questions of this kind; and had pro∣bably
<PB N="391" REF="392"/>
been made the cloak of unconscionable bargains,
such as could not be remedied at common law, (by reason
that the lender ran the risk of the fall of the price below his
interest); the statute last mentioned, made provision for re∣ducing
them “to sik conformity of price as shall answer to
ten for the hundred allenarly,” (being the rate of inte∣rest
at that time), “swa that the party addebted payand ten
for the hundred, the samine shall be as lawful, as gif they
had paid the victual contained in the said infeftments.”
Now, though this act will no longer apply in its own precise
terms; yet upon the principle of it, which seems in itself
to be just, and calculated, like the act of Anne, for hinder∣ing
all receipt of undue profit, “directly or indirectly;” it
may seem that the creditor who receives a much greater
quantity of grain than by the fiars of the year corresponds
to the lawful rate of interest, and who wilfully refuses to
let his bargain be reformed according to that standard, shall
be liable to the charge of usury. It is true, that in the case
of Skene of Hallyards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. 1672.</NOTE> such a charge was found irrelevant;
but this probably, (for the interlocutor does not assign
any reason), because the advantage libelled was neither
clear nor considerable, nor imputable, in the whole circum∣stances
of the case, to a purpose of defrauding the law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">If, as Mackenzie seems to think, (No. 4. <HI>tit. Usury</HI>), it proceeded on the notion that the act 1597, c. 251. did not abrogate the prior statute 1594, c. 122: which allows an <HI>absolute</HI> stipulation of five bolls of victual for each L. 100, the propriety of it may be questioned. For the act 1597, appears to be a <HI>general</HI> statute, for reducing all bargains of annualrent of victual, to conformity with the lawful rate of interest. This was a separate charge from that mentioned in p. 389.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Payment of In∣terest before∣hand</NOTE> in which also our custom seems
to have been more rigorous than that of England; and yet,
<PB N="392" REF="393"/>
as not being inconsistent with the act of Anne, our own
rules must still be observed, when the occasion of applying
them shall happen. This is the payment of interest before∣hand.
To a certain extent at least, this practice is pro∣vided
against by the act 1621, c. 28.; which ordains, “That
no person who lendes or gives out money, and receaves
annuel therefor, shall retaine the time of the lending, ex∣act,
crave or receave from their debtors the annuel of
their lent summes; untill the tearme of payment appoynt∣ed
by their bandes be first come.”</P>
<P>THE retention of a year's interest out of the principal
loan of 2500 merks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1. 1666.</NOTE> was, accordingly, one of the articles of
charge which were found relevant in the case of James Har∣per.
But, under authority of the last words of the statute, the
penalties of usury have even been applied to the receiving of
interest at any period after the loan, for a term not yet expi∣red.
Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11. 1666.</NOTE> John Purdie was convicted of usury upon the
evidence of two receipts, one of the 18th July 1663, for the
term's interest due at Martinmas 1663, and the other of the
27th November 1663, for the term's interest due at Whit∣sunday
1664.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23. 1668.</NOTE> In like manner, Hugh Roxburgh was convic∣ted
“of taking the annualrent of 1800 merks ane month or
thereby before the term of payment, or the same was
due.” In the first of these instances, the verdict was car∣ried
by one vote;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 6. 1666.</NOTE> and the Privy Council, having considered
the circumstances of the case, prohibited the passing of any
doom on the conviction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 30. 1668.</NOTE> In the other, the pannel had sen∣tence
of escheat of moveables. The like sentence was
given in the case of William Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 18. &amp; 25. 1667.</NOTE> upon this
ground; that having lent a sum of 20,000 merks, he, upon
the 13th of May 1658, gave the debtor a discharge of the
interest down to Whitsunday 1660, and at the same time
<PB N="393" REF="394"/>
took from him a bond of corroboration, accumulating the
principal and these two years interest into one sum<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The assize find the pannel guilty, and culpable in exacting and taking ten for the hundred of five thousand merks in manner mentioned in the dittay; as also, all in ane voice finds the pannel guilty and culpable of the exacting the an∣nualrent of 20,800 merks two years before the same was due, contrary to the act of Parliament, viz. from Whitsunday 1658 to Whitsunday 1660, in respect they find the same sufficiently proven.”</NOTE> This
was an aggravated case: But it may seem doubtful whe∣ther
the simple taking of interest before arrival of the
term, on a sum which has really been advanced, is either
properly usurious in itself, or within the purview of the sta∣tute
1621; which is ambiguously worded, and perhaps has
only relation to the stronger case therein specially set forth,
of the retention of the interest out of the principal sum,
at the time of the loan. Notice may be taken of the later
case of Cleland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 15. 1741, C. Home.</NOTE> where the Court of Session found that a re∣ceipt
of interest down to Lammas, and dated in the pre∣ceding
month of January, was no sufficient evidence of usury,
to annul a bond for a loan of money.</P>
<P>BUT granting that the law has not been strained in this
construction;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Receipt of In∣terest before∣hand.</NOTE> it does not follow, nor is there any precedent
for it, that the statute, equivocally worded as it is, shall be
interpreted by the very letter; so as to hinder the receiving
of interest before the term of payment written in the bond,
though it be rendered in proportion only to the time du∣ring
which the creditor has had the use of the money, whe∣ther
this be half a year, or a quarter of a year, or even a
shorter period. The creditor has indeed an advantage in the
more prompt payment; yet still he receives from this debtor
only the lawful interest for the time that the money has re∣mained
<PB N="394" REF="395"/>
with him. An exception must also be admitted of
the transactions of bankers; some of which, and the most
useful and frequent of any, such as the discounting of bills,
might seem to fall under the sanction of this statute, if rigo∣rously
construed.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to all the authorities in our law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stipulation of Interest upon Interest is un∣lawful.</NOTE> which in this
article is grounded on the Civil, it is also an unlawful and
fruitless covenant, to bargain for interest upon interest<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, tit. Usury, No. 5.; Stair, p. 139.; Bankt. vol. i. p. 440. No. 14.</NOTE>: but
this is only true according to a distinction. The creditor
is not forbidden annually to take a new document for the
actual arrear of interest, and thus convert it into a stock,
which shall bear interest in time to come. For after this course,
the debtor's attention is roused to the increase of the burden
upon him; and if he wittingly choose to retain the interest
upon these terms, there is no good reason why it may not be
lent to him, equally as to any other person<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This matter is debated in the case of James Daes, Nov. 22. 1664; but the interlocutor and proceedings are perplexed and obscure.</NOTE>. But if the
arrear is suffered silently to run on for a series of years,
and, at settlement of accounts, a charge is made against the
debtor, upon the principle of compound interest; this is
an oppressive exaction to that person, who, unconscious of
the growing evil, had all the while neglected to keep down
the claim. The law will not, therefore, support the creditor
in his demand of a settlement on that ground; nor will it
give effect to a previous paction for compound interest,
which would be a plain temptation to the lender, always to
stipulate in that form, and to forbear the demanding of the
interest as it falls due: not to mention that the debtor,
not being pushed for payment, would be apt to forget
<PB N="395" REF="396"/>
or to undervalue the operation of such a covenant against
him.</P>
<P>BUT, though the paction or demand of compound interest,
be, for these equitable reasons, ineffectual in law; yet if
parties actually settle accounts on that footing, it is not
so clear that the creditor is subject to the treble penalties,
as taking more than 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the sum lent. The ar∣gument
against it is, that truly the additional profit is not
taken for forbearance of the original sum, but of the an∣nual
profits, which ought to have been paid, and might
have been exacted, and have been gainful to the debtor by
remaining in his hands. And it happens in many instances,
that things which the law, for good reasons, will not
enforce, it yet holds for valid when done, and will not undo.
Certain it is, that I have found no instance of conviction,
nor even of interlocutor of relevancy, obtained upon such
grounds. It is at the same time clear, that if (as in the case
of Cohoun and Dun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 12. 1790.</NOTE> where it was so judged) the creditor
shall accumulate the interest <HI>termly,</HI> and take a bill for the
amount; this bill is void, as being an assurance of usurious
profits: for they are more than 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> for a year's
forbearance of the original loan. By the same rule, if he
take payment of such bill, the treble penalties also shall be
due.</P>
<P>THE pains of law for usury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pains of Law for Usury.</NOTE> have in part been already
mentioned. They are, 1. by the act of Anne, the nul∣lity
of the bond or contract, where it contains, directly
or indirectly, any usurious stipulation. By the act 1594,
c. 222. the debtor was to be discharged of his obligation,
if he revealed the usury; and if another revealed it, the
<PB N="396" REF="397"/>
claim of debt was to accrue to the revealer. By the act 1597,
c. 251. this was altered for a confiscation of the sum, and or∣dinary
interest, in all cases, to the King; along with restitu∣tion
of the usurious profits to the debtor, if he concur∣red
in the prosecution. But both these regulations seem
to be superseded by the act of Anne, which introduces
an absolute nullity of the obligation; such as is not only
good against the creditor and his heirs, but even against his
onerous assignees, who were not affected by the Scottish
statutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Kilk. Decis. <HI>v.</HI> Usury, p. 591. No. 1.</NOTE>. 2. By the act of Anne, in case, of usurious profit
being received, action lies for treble the amount of the sum
lent or contracted on; whereof one half goes to the party,
whatsoever, prosecutor, and the other to the King, who may
sue for these penalties without the debtor's concurrence; and
whose suit seems to be subject to no other limitation with
respect to the competent time for bringing it, than according
to the common rules of the law of Scotland<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">December 2. 1766, Mackechnie against Wallace; January 19. 1775, James Wilson against James Jackson. Wallace's Decisions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. To these pecuniary penalties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corporal Pains; if still compe∣tent.</NOTE> the act 1597, c. 251. super∣adds
the confiscation of moveables, and other punishments
in the person. I do not, however, find that this discretion∣ary
power of inflicting corporal punishment has in any in∣stance
been made use of; although in the case of William
Sommerville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 25. 1667. Nov. 23. 1668.</NOTE> and in that of Hugh Roxburgh, after decla∣ring
the escheat of goods, the sentence ordains the pannel to
find caution for his appearance before the Court or Privy
Council “whenever he shall be called, to underlie such other
<PB N="397" REF="398"/>
“punishment and censure, as they shall think sit.” And
indeed, even as to the escheat of moveables, and much more
as to any farther severity, it may seem to deserve conside∣ration
whether it be not in effect taken away by the act of
Anne; which establishes the present rate of interest, and pre∣scribes
the penalties of usury for both kingdoms, as relative
to this rate, in like manner as the act 1597 did with relation
to the rate of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> at that time allowed. If still com∣petent,
the confiscation and other pains can only be inflicted
in the Court of Justiciary, to which the act 1597 remits the
cognisance of the proper criminal charge; whereas not only
may the nullity of the contract be declared, in the way of
either action or exception, in any court where the writing is
put in suit; but even the treble penalties may be decreed by
any Judge-Ordinary, and without the assistance of a Jury;
this being a pure pecuniary action. These points were set∣tled
in the case of Wilson and Jackson above referred to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 19. 1775.</NOTE>
4. By the act of Anne, any scrivener, broker, solicitor, or
driver of bargains, who for procuring the loan or forbear∣ance
of L. 100 shall take above 5 s. is made liable to a fine
of L. 20, and six months imprisonment.</P>
<P>THE competent evidence of usury has not been left
to the course of common law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of using Oath of Party.</NOTE> but is the subject of spe∣cial
provisions; which being equivocally penned, have
given rise to controversy, and fluctuation of practice.
The direction given in the statute 1597, was, that it
should “be tried by the <HI>aith of party,</HI> and all uther law∣ful
probation, <HI>conjoyned therewith,</HI> competent of the law.”
Under these words, a doubt had arisen concerning the
oath which was meant to be used; whether it were the
oath of the party debtor, and payer of the unlawful in∣terest,
<PB N="398" REF="399"/>
or of the party receiver and pannel. This contro∣versy
was settled by the act 1600, c. 7. which allows the li∣bel
to be proved, “by writte or aith of party <HI>receaver</HI> of the
said unlawful profite, <HI>and</HI> be the witnesses <HI>insert in the said
security</HI> made for the said summes.” In the case, according∣ly,
of Robert Lauder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 4. 1668.</NOTE> after interlocutor sustaining the defences
against the libel as laid, reference was made <HI>simpliciter</HI> to
the oath of the pannel, that he had received more than the
lawful interest; which, with the pannel's consent, was found
relevant; and on swearing in his own favour he was assoil∣zied.
In the case too of James Wilson<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“In supplement of the deposition of the witnesses, and remanent probation, the Justices, with consent of the pannel, and his procurators, ordaynes the said James Wilsone's oath to be taken.”</NOTE>, but only with his
own consent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 11. 1667.</NOTE> his oath was allowed to be taken, along with,
and in supplement of other probation. He swore <HI>negative,</HI> and
was assoilzied. Whether, without his consent, his oath
could have been resorted to in this supplementary way, and
not as decisive of the cause, I shall not affirm. On the one
hand, this sort of reference to the oath of party is contrary
to the ordinary rule of law, even for civil interests and
actions; and on the other, the words of both statutes 1597
and 1600, give a colour at least to argue, that the Legisla∣ture
intended to permit it. But these laws are both of them
very incorrectly drawn; and I have not observed, that in
any instance the prosecutor for usury has advanced such a
pretension. Indeed, if that plea be good on his side; the
words of both statutes give the pannel equal countenance
in this pretension, (which, however, does not seem to have
been urged on any occasion), that his oath is in every instance
<PB N="399" REF="400"/>
a <HI>necessary</HI> part of the proof, without which he cannot be
convicted.</P>
<P>IN regard to the evidence of witnesses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof by Wit∣nesses; who are competent.</NOTE> the said statute 1600,
while it solved one doubt, gave rise by its expressions to ano∣ther,
namely, whether this sort of proof were not confined to
the witnesses inserted in the deed. But this would be such a
limitation of the process, as truly to prevent conviction, ex∣cept
upon very rare occasions. And as the act 1600 was in∣tended
in the main to do away the ambiguity of the former
law, with respect to the oath of party; so in the brief men∣tion
which it makes of the instrumentary witnesses, as also
competent to give evidence, it seems more probable, that
the Legislature intended to obviate the doubts which might
arise concerning the admissibility of those persons, whose
evidence upon the matter of usury may often be contra∣dictory
to, and tend to set aside the written contract which
they have subscribed. Accordingly, as appears from the
judgment in the case of Harper<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“The Justice depute, notwithstanding of the defence, ordains the dittay to be put to the knowledge of an assize, and to be proven by witnesses, albeit not insert in the writ.”</NOTE>, relative to a bribe of
L.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 1. 1666.</NOTE> 100 for the loan of the money; it was at that time
a settled point, that matters extrinsic to the bond or con∣tract
might be proved by any witnesses whatsoever. And in
the civil court the like judgment was given, with respect to
the payment of interest beforehand, in the case of James Mit∣chell
<HI>contra</HI> William Petrie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 7. 1724, Kaimes.</NOTE> under provision that the wit∣nesses
were persons above exception. Now, these judgments
seem to be truly decisive of the general point: For the
<PB N="400" REF="401"/>
statute has not distinguished between one description of cases
and another.</P>
<P>THE question may likewise be stated concerning the
debtor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is the debtor a habile Witness.</NOTE> whether he is a competent witness to prove this of∣fence,
committed indeed against him, but of which he is al∣so
in some measure himself participant. Now, with respect
to him, there seems to be room for a distinction. If the
debtor is pursuing, either to declare the nullity of his con∣tract,
or to recover the treble penalties; certainly he can∣not
at the same time be a witness in his own cause, and for
his own behoof. Farther, even though the prosecution be
at instance of the King; yet still if the claim of debt be
standing, this seems to be such a situation in which the
debtor cannot justly be admitted to give evidence; by reason
of the strong and immediate interest on his part, which
arises, as the law now is, from the absolute nullity of the
contract, which ensues upon conviction. Agreeably to this
view; under the old laws 1594 and 1597, by which the
debtor's interest in the conviction depended on the circum∣stance
of his being informer of the King's Advocate, and
concurring in the reduction of the contract, the practice was
only to admit his testimony, if he would purge himself up∣on
oath of these grounds of suspicion. Thus, in the trial of
Rutherford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 29. 1664.</NOTE> Daes and others, for separate acts of usury,
John Learmonth, and Thomas Kincaid, the debtors, were
admitted witnesses <HI>cum nota;</HI> they purging themselves of ha∣ving
been informers of those particular charges, and renoun∣cing
all benefit they might have by the process. In the case,
too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 11. 1667.</NOTE> of James Wilson, which Mackenzie has noted as a judg∣ment
on the other side, the procedure seems truly to have
been to the same purpose. For though it be true, that the
<PB N="401" REF="402"/>
interlocutor of Court, finds the objection relevant to
George Home of Graden the debtor, offered as a witness to
prove the libel; yet there is this entry in the record imme∣diately
under it: “Thereafter George Home of Graden
being sworn, deponit that he had given information of this
pursuit to the pursuer.” In like manner, Alexander Home,
the next witness, being objected to for the same reason, he is
sworn upon it; and having confessed that he is informer, he is
no farther examined: so that in both instances the judgment
was qualified by relation to the debtor's interest in the prose∣cution<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie farther makes mention of the case of Sommerville as a prece∣dent for admitting the debtor's testimony. But it does not seem to be in point to this question; for in that case Stewart of Hillside, the debtor, only de∣poned respecting a particular fact or defence which the <HI>pannel</HI> offered to prove in that way. And it was not till after Stewart had deponed <HI>negative</HI> on this de∣fence, that the libel was remitted to an assize, According to the practice of that time, if the defence had been proved by Stewart's deposition, the libel never would have gone to an assize at all.</NOTE> Now, according to this principle, as applicable to
the present state of the law, by which the nullity of the as∣surance
of debt is independent of all such considerations, the
debtor seems with us, (as he is in England), to be liable to
an absolute objection; if the debt is still subsisting. But if
the debt has been fully paid, in which case the treble penalties
are due; and if the debtor will renounce the right which he
has under the act of Anne, to pursue for a moiety of those
penalties, as one of the people; the objection seems thus to be
done away, to the effect; at least of admitting him <HI>cum nota.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be proper to say, before concluding, that owing to
the altered situation of the country, and the less hazard which
the debtor now runs of being oppressed by the money-lend∣er,
any criminal charge for this offence would probably meet
<PB N="402" REF="403"/>
with a more lenient construction than seems to have been
used in former times. The period in which chiefly the laws
against usury were put to execution, appears to have been
from 1663 to 1670. And in that space the prosecutions
were very numerous indeed: owing, it is supposed, to a gift
of the penalties and forfeitures in favour of the Earl of
Glencairn, who appears as prosecutor in all those actions;
and who, in the view of constraining parties to compound
with him, (in which, to judge by the many deserted diets
in the record, he was very successful), had set on foot
a di∣ligent
inquisition concerning all offences on this kind. In∣deed,
to such excess was his activity carried, that the Privy
council in the end interposed to forbid all process for
usury at
any private instance, without a special warrant from them∣selves;
and for infringing this ordinance, a fine was inflict∣ed
on one Muschet, on the 19th January 1674. There has
not, in the present century, been any instance of a libel for
usury raised in the Supreme Criminal Court.</P>
<P>II. IN this chapter I may also take notice of the offence
of fraudulent bankruptcy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Fraudulent Bankrupcy.</NOTE> or the wilful cheating of credi∣tors
by an insolvent person, or one who conducts himself as
such; whether this be done by withdrawing his effects for
his own use and behoof, or for that of others, whom he is dis∣posed
unduly to favour. By statute 1696, c. 5. this iniquity
stands remitted to the cognisance of the Supreme Civil Court,
who are directed to declare the offender infamous; and are also
empowered to punish him “by banishment or otherwise, death
excepted, as they shall see cause,” according to the measure
of his fault. The ordinary course has been by sentence of
pillory: as in the case of James Wauchope, February 4. 1757;
and of James and George Keltie, February 14. 1776. But
<PB N="403" REF="404"/>
in more aggravated cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">FORESTAILING.</NOTE> such as that of George and Ro∣bert
Forresters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 26. 1748.</NOTE> the pannel has been adjudged to be trans∣ported
beyond seas. Though brought in the civil court,
the prosecution of this crime has been found to be thus far
in the ordinary condition of a criminal process; that it can
only be raised with the concurrence of the Lord Advocate;
August 10. 1765, Syme <HI>contra</HI> Steel; February 9. 1796, Hew
Darby <HI>contra</HI> James Love.</P>
<P>III. I SHALL now close the list of offences injurious to the
interest of trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Forestalling and Regrating.</NOTE> with a few words upon forestalling and re∣grating.
The first of these, as described in the statute 1592,
c. 150. (which is a literal transcript of the English stat. 5.
and 6. Edward VI. c. 14.) is committed in the buying, or
contracting for any commodity that is on the way to mar∣ket;
or the dissuading any one who is on the way to mar∣ket,
from carrying his commodity there; or the making
motion to enhance the prices in the market. By the same
statute, the person is to be held <HI>a regrator,</HI> who buys corn,
victual, flesh, fish, or other <HI>vivres,</HI> in fair or market, and
sells them again either in the same, or in any other fair or
market, within four miles thereof; or who, by buying, con∣tract,
or promise, gets into his hand the corn growing in the
field. The punishment is, for the first offence, a fine of
L. 40, and the finding of surety to abstain for the future;
for the second, a fine of 100 merks; and for the third,
escheat of moveables. And to facilitate conviction, the sta∣tute
authorises to send the accused to an assize upon a gene∣ral
charge of being <HI>habite and repute</HI> a common engrosser or
regrator, without any more special dittay. There are many
instances of the prosecution of forestallers and regrators; but
few convictions have been obtained; and of those which are
<PB N="404" REF="405"/>
on record, some appear not to have been followed with any
sentence. On the 15th May 1588, Alexander and James Robert∣son
and Thomas Reid were convicted of forestalling cattle and
sheep, and keeping it up to a dearth; and they were fined. On
the 9th June 1596, John Wilson and Bernard Stuart, were con∣victed
of forestalling and regrating corn; but I cannot find that
any punishment ensued. On the 12th of the same month, John
Anderson, and others, were accused as regrators, on the single
ground of buying corn as merchants, in order to sell it again;
which, according to the prosecutor's doctrine, was unlawful
for any but maltsters and dealers in meal. The pannels an∣swered,
(and certainly with reason), that corn is a lawful
subject of merchandise, if the trade be not carried on by
forestalling or regrating; and that otherwise, all transporta∣tion
of corn from the remote parts of the country would
cease; since none but merchants would be at the trouble, or
run the hazard. The Justice, however, “fand the sum∣mons
relevant;” and some of the pannels were convicted:
But no sentence is marked in the record. The same is the
case with respect to John White, John Mure and others,
who were convicted on the 25th of the same month, of fore∣stalling
and regrating corn. I have observed but one con∣viction
more; that of John Reale, (or Rule), merchant in
Leith, convicted of forestalling and regrating, by privately
purchasing a ship load of timber in the harbour of that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 19. and 20. 1607.</NOTE>
before landing or entry in the town's books, or the putting
of a price upon it by the Magistrates, as directed by the
statutes 1540, c. 100.; 1555, c. 57. He had sentence in
terms of the statute, as for the first offence.</P>
<P>WE know from the statute-book, that beside the laws
against forestalling and regrating, the policy of former times
had shackled the commerce of the lieges, with many other
<PB N="405" REF="406"/>
and more troublesome restraints, (at least they are thought
so now), which were enforced by fines and confiscations,
and in some instances by more severe penalties. Accordingly
there are instances in the record, from time to time, of pro∣secution
for such crimes as these: the transporting of tallow
forth of the kingdom; the selling of linen, cattle, &amp;c. to
the English; and the enhancing of the price of malt<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Books of Adjournal, April 28. 1585, Inhabitants of Musselburgh; June 9. 1596, Robert Knox.</NOTE>. But
it would serve no purpose to enlarge on these points of dit∣tay;
which were long ago thrown out of the criminal code,
by the great change in the situation of the country, and in
the manners, opinions, and custom of dealing of our people.</P>

which is due to his Majesty from all his subjects,
in return for the protection of his laws and dominion.
And which to forget or disown, is not only deemed a hei∣nous
crime, by reason of the danger to the peace and tran∣quillity
of the kingdom, which are so highly concerned in
the preservation of the person, dignity and authority of the
King; but also in a moral point of view, as a treacherous
breach, <HI>proditio,</HI> of that trust and considence which the
Prince reposes in every one of his subjects, as standing
bound to him by the manifold and signal benefits, which
they are continually receiving from the Sovereignty.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="408"/>
As this high crime may be committed in a great variety
of ways;<NOTE PLACE="marg">TREASON.</NOTE> so to analise it to any advantage, would require
a long and laborious treatise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots Treason Law abolished at the Union.</NOTE> if it were to be compiled from
the like materials, as those which have hitherto served us in
our researches. But fortunately for this part of the realm,
any commentary on the Scottish statutes or precedents and au∣thorities,
is rendered unnecessary by an event which has at once
blotted out the▪ whole of them; and communicated to us the
benefit of an entire new, and far more improved system of
treason law, wherein great moderation and precision are hap∣pily
united with a high degree of vigour; and which alone now
serves to regulate the trial and decision of all such charges.</P>
<P>AT the Union of the two kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And that of England extend∣ed to Scotland.</NOTE> when, beside ac∣knowledging
the same Prince, they were to be consolidated
in one government, and ruled by the same Legislature, as
parts of one realm; it was plainly seen to be expedient, or
rather necessary, that the inhabitants of both countries should
be placed upon the same footing, with respect also to the
bonds of their allegiance to that Government, and the con∣sequences
of any violation of those public and interesting
duties. In this view, a general provision was inserted in
the act of Union, and in that article of it (the 18th)
which saves and maintains the laws of “Scotland, declaring,”
that the laws which concern public right, policy and ci∣vil
government, may be made the same throughout the
whole united kingdom.” Under authority of which allow∣ance,
and in order (as the title bears) to the improvement of
the Union of the two kingdoms, a statute was soon after
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Anne, c. 21.</NOTE> in which it is declared, “That such crimes and of∣fences
which are high treason or misprision of high trea∣son
within England, shall be construed, adjudged and
<PB N="408" REF="409"/>
taken to be high treason, and misprision of high treason
within Scotland; and that from thenceforth, no crimes
or offences shall be high treason or misprision of high
treason within Scotland, but those that are high treason
or misprision of high treason in England.” It farther
provides, that the pains, penalties and forfeitures of high
treason shall be the same in both countries; and it appoints
a mode of inquiry and trial, such as is agreeable to the
English practice.</P>
<P>To be acquainted with this part of the system, the Scots
lawyer has therefore to resort to the books of the law of
England. Now, as these are patent to all the world, and treat
very fully, and with much ability of the subject; so all that
shall here be proposed to be done, is to compile a summary
from them, (and this in many places without an alteration
even of their words), of those leading and settled points of
doctrine, wherein all the best authorities are agreed.</P>
<P>THE great basis of the law of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute 25th Edward III. c. 2. is the Ba∣sis of Treason Law.</NOTE> is the statute of the
25th Edward III. c. 2.; which passed for the purpose of
settling the nature and limits of this offence, and of
correcting the too great latitude of loose and constructive
doctrine, which had sometimes been applied to it; whereby
every thing had been interpreted to be treason, which was
or might be reputed to be an encroachment on Royal power,
or to the diminution of the dignity of the Crown<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, part 1. c. 11. p. 80. <HI>et seq.</HI>—Hawkin's, b. 1. c. 17. No. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I. IT is treason under the first branch of this statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compassing the Death of the King.</NOTE>
“when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our
Lord the King, or of our Lady the Queen, or of their
<PB N="409" REF="410"/>
eldest Son and heir.” By these words, it is not the
killing of the King that is alone made treason, but even to
compass or imagine his death; that is, to entertain the pur∣pose,
or conceive the design, of aiming so fatal a blow at
the tranquillity of the kingdom. In holding this to be a
crime of as deep a die as the actual perpetration of the
murder, it is said that the English Legislature had not
invented a new principle, but only recurred to an old
one. Their ancient writers, in treating of homicide, had
taught that the murderous intention, manifested by plain
facts, was of the same degree of guilt, and equally punish∣able
as the complete crime; and this rule, though laid
aside as rigorous in regard to ordinary persons, the statute
of Edward has for the public benefit, and through sense of
the high national interest in the preservation of the person of
the King, adopted and maintained in his particular case. It
has been considered, that the life of the King cannot in the
ordinary course of things be taken away, without involving
the whole land in bloodshed and confusion. “The law
therefore (says Foster) tendereth the safety of the King
with an anxious, and if I may use the expression, with a con∣cern
bordering upon jealousy: It considereth the wicked
imaginations of the heart in the same degree of guilt as
if carried into actual execution, from the moment that
measures appear to have been taken to render them ef∣fectual<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster's Crown Law, p. 193. 195.; Blackst. Com. b. 4. c. 6. notes. We find the same doctrine, and even phraseology, in the oldest Scottish record with respect to treason. The conviction of John Master of Forbes, July 14. 1537, is thus: “<HI>Convictus de arte et parte proditionis et abominabilis</HI> imaginationis <HI>inter∣fectionis et destructionis nobilissimae personae serenissimi domini nostri regis, per bombardum seu machinam bellicam (lie Culvering vulgariter appellat.”)</HI> The like in the conviction of Lady Glamyss, for an <HI>attempt</HI> to poison the King. Ju∣ly 17. 1537.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="411"/>
THE provision added by Foster in these last words, is what
the statute is understood to mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compassing must be shown by overt Act.</NOTE> when it requires that the of∣fender
shall “thereof be proveably attainted of open deed, by
the people of their condition.” That is to say, as the law∣yers
of later times have commonly expressed it, that his pur∣pose
or imagination against the life of the King must be de∣monstrated
in some <HI>overt</HI> act, which is made out by sufficient
proof against him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The form of the statute is strictly followed out in practice, in making the charge. A strong instance of this is, that in the trial of the regi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides, the charge was not for <HI>killing</HI> the King, but for <HI>compassing</HI> the King's death; and the execu∣tion and beheading of the King, were given as overt acts, to prove that compas∣sing. In the meeting of the Judges, preparatory to the trial, “It was agreed that the <HI>actual murder</HI> of the King should be precisely laid in the indictment, with the special circumstances as it was done, and should be made use of as <HI>one of the overt acts,</HI> to prove the <HI>compassing of the death.</HI>” St. Trials, v. ii. p. 308.</NOTE>. And this seems to be necessary in two
points of view. First as matter of evidence; in as much as
the purpose of the heart, the imagining of the King's death, is
such a matter as can only appear, or become the subject of
judicial cognisance, through some external act which is in∣dicative
thereof, or connected with it. But farther, it
is not as evidence only of the treasonable purpose that the
<HI>overt</HI> acts are to be considered, but as the means also made use
of to accomplish that purpose, and which tend to carry it into
execution. It was in this light that <HI>overt</HI> acts were required
by the ancient practice, in the case of ordinary homicide; and
in the same light they are still considered in the case of trea∣son:
<PB N="411" REF="412"/>
with this only (very natural and proper difference), that
whereas in the case of an ordinary man nothing would
have served for an overt act, but some direct and violent
attempt on the life of the person; here, on the contrary, by
reason of the higher interest in the safety of the Sove∣reign,
acts of less malignity, or of more remote prepara∣tion
and tendency to his destruction, shall equally be su∣stained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Forster, p. 203, 204, 195. In order to obviate all doubts which might be entertained with respect to the degree of violence which should be held sufficient evidence of a purpose against the life of the King, a statute was passed in the 36th of Geo. III. c. 7. on occa∣sion of an outrage offered to his Majesty's person, which makes it treason, “to compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction, or any <HI>bodily harm, tending</HI> to death or destruction, <HI>maim or wounding,</HI> imprisonment or restraint of the person of our Sovereign Lord the King.” This enactment both in words and substance, has a near analogy to the Scots statute 1662, C. 2. It endures only during the life of his present Majesty, and until the end of the next session of Parliament, after a demise of the Crown.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS it seems to be agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overt Acts di∣rectly relative to the King.</NOTE> that these things are sufficient
overt acts to make a compassing of the King's death: to lie
in wait in order to attempt his life; to provide arms, or pre∣pare
poison for that purpose, or to send letters for the execu∣tion
thereof; to assemble and consult upon the means how
he may be killed, though no resolution be come to; nay the
mere presence at such a consultation, and concealment of
what passes, though without any actual part taken there∣in,
if by a person who has previous knowledge of the purpose
of the assembly. In like manner, to offer money to any one
to kill the King, whether the money be taken or refused;
or in any manner of way, by special advice, persuasion, or
command, to instigate or encourage any one to a course of
<PB N="412" REF="413"/>
action for taking away his life: these also are clear grounds
of this sort of charge; being not only plain demonstrations

“For experience hath shown (says Foster), that be∣tween
the prisons and the graves of Princes, the distance
is very small.” In conformity to the same principle of
<PB N="413" REF="414"/>
political justice, the like judgment must be passed with respect
to the mere conspiracy or consultation to levy war, or the
holding of deliberations and taking measures towards insur∣rection,
if the object of that insurrection be such as in the
judgment of law is intended against the person or govern∣ment
of the King: as to compel him to alter his measures,
or dismiss his counsellors, or submit to their demands of re∣formation
in the State, or in general to constrain him in, or
enforce him to any act, which he has right to do by his
Sovereignty<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 211. No. 3.—Hale, vi. p. 148. No. 2. p. 122, 123, 151. No. 8.—Hawkin's, vi. i. p. 35. No. 9. See also the opinion of Lord Chief-Justice Holt, on the trial of Sir John Friend, March 23. 1695. Also the trial of Sir Christ. Blunt. St. Tr. v. i. p. 209.</NOTE>. For such purposes cannot be effected by
numbers and open force, without manifest danger to his
person; “and (says Hale) it is a kind of natural and ne∣cessary
consequence that he that attempts to conquer and
subdue the King, cannot intend less than to take away his
life.” This was held to be a settled point in the case of Chri∣stopher
Layer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Tr. vol. vi. p. 328.</NOTE> (tried in November 1722), against whom it was
laid for an overt act, that he had planned and consulted to
levy war, in order to seize and depose the King. On the
same principle judgment was given in the late cases of Watt
and Downie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 1794.</NOTE> who were convicted of holding consultations
and providing arms towards an insurrection, for the purpose
of taking the government into the hands of them and
their associates, and compelling the King to submit to their
demands. As having a tendency, though not so immediate,
to the same end, the soliciting of a foreign power to invade
the kingdom, or the concerting of measures with such power
for that purpose, had been subjected to the same constructive
rule: nay the mere act of going into a foreign country, or,
<PB N="414" REF="415"/>
as in Lord Preston's case, the mere purpose and motion to go
thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 17. 1690.</NOTE> when testified by the accompanying circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State Trials, vol. iv. p. 448, 449.</NOTE>
to have been for the purpose of forming such a concert<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 196.—Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 35. No. 9.—Hale, p. 120, 121, 122, 123.

<P>WITH respect to writings:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writings; are they overt Acts?</NOTE> How far and in what sense
these may amount to an overt act of treason, had been a
point of controversy, and the subject of some judgments under
arbitrary Princes, which have not met with the approba∣tion
of sound lawyers, or impartial judges, in later times.
But what may be maintained upon the credit of the best
authorities, seems to be thus.</P>
<P>1. No writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speculative Writings not published.</NOTE> how wicked and abominable soever, amount
to treason, if they are purely speculative, and without re∣lation
to any treasonable practice that is on foot, or in con∣templation
of the offender at the time; and are withal
kept in the author's own possession, unpublished. A treatise,
for instance, branding all kingly government as an usurpa∣tion,
and maintaining that it is therefore right to dethrone
<PB N="415" REF="416"/>
or to kill our Sovereign; if it has no connection with any
purpose of insurrection, or violence to the King's person,
that is in agitation at the time, but appears to be the wild
effusion of a bad heart or an unsound head; will not bear
out a charge of treason: for, while unpublished, it is not
in anywise a measure or motion towards the destruction of the
King, nor clearly proves the existence of any such malignant
resolution. It is in this respect that the judgment in the case
of Algernon Sydney was, and has continued to be thought
exceptionable. It is true, that he was charged also with trea∣sonable
measures and attempts; but these were unconnected
with the essays and papers found in his closet, which were
laid as of themselves amounting to an overt act<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 198—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 80, 81.—Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 38. No. 32. I find this case of Algernon Sydney, quoted in the pleadings on the Scots case of Robert Calder, minister at Nenthorn, September 6. 1693. The paper there libelled was in a more unfavourable shape; being the draught of a manifesto ad∣dressed to the people, and exciting them to take up arms for restoring the Epis∣copal government. A more lenient decision was, however, pronounced: “Find the manifesto mentioned in the indictment does contain treasonable mat∣ters; but finds, that the pennel's being the framer or writer thereof, does not infer the crime of treason against him, unless he had shown or divulged it to some person before it was seized, or among his papers; yet finds the same re∣levant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” The prosecutor declined to take any proof on this interlo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utor.</NOTE>▪ of treason.</P>
<P>2. IT is no less clear on the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writings rela∣tive
to a trea∣sonable Purpose.</NOTE> and is indeed on
all hands agreed, that writings, though unpublished, and
much more where they are divulged, may amount to a pro∣per
overt act; if they are relative to any treasonably mea∣sure
which is in actual preparation. As in the case of a letter
inviting a foreign power to invade the kingdom; even though
the letter should never come to hand. This, indeed, was resol∣ved
<PB N="416" REF="417"/>
in the case of▪ Lord Preston and Mr Ashton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 17. &amp; 19. 1690.</NOTE> whose pa∣pers
and memorials, containing the plan of an invasion, though
never communicated to the French King or his ministers,
were however laid and read as overt acts of compassing the
King's death; being written in prosecution of a certain de∣terminate
purpose which was treasonable, and was in imme∣diate
prospect of execution. The like opinion prevailed in
the case Francis Francia;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 22. 1716.</NOTE> where one of the overt acts laid
in the indictment, and that which chiefly was insisted on,
and attempted to be proved, was the writing of certain let∣ters
to persons in France<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The only other overt act laid in the indictment, is consulting to raise an insurrection; which was also agreed to be an overt act of compassing the King's death.</P>
<P>In regard to the letters, the Lord Chief Baron said to the jury. “Now if you believe that these letters were wrote to him and by him, and that they contain a correspondence of a treasonable nature, inciting or encouraging any persons to levy war against the King, or any thing which shows that he was privy and assenting to it, then he is guilty of high treason.” “And if you believe that he did promote the invasion, or conceal and assent to that design, that is, a conspiring the death of the King; then he will be guilty of the treason char∣ged in the indictment.” St. Trials, vol. vi. p. 100,—102.</P></NOTE>, declaring his intention to join in
a rebellion, and soliciting assistance towards such an enter∣prize.
And again, in the case of Mr Layer, (November
1722), where the paper published was subservient to a de∣sign
of seizing on the Tower, and some principal persons
about the King<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 198, 218. No. 8.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT between these, there seems to be a third case; that of
words and opinions, <HI>written and published,</HI> which plainly
tend to the danger of the King's life, and yet cannot be
<PB N="417" REF="418"/>
shown to have relation to any plot or conspiracy that is in
existence against him; so that the discourse or writing is itself
the only evidence of the treasonable purpose. On such a case
(as I understand the author) Sir Mathew Hale expresses him∣self
thus<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 118. No. 7.</NOTE>: “Those words which being spoken will not make
an overt act to make good an indictment of compassing the
King's death; yet if they are reduced into writing by the
delinquent, either letters or books, will make an overt act in
the writer, to make good such an indictment, <HI>if the matters
contained in them import such a compassing.</HI>” Now these last
words seem to suggest a distinction. If any one publish a
book, or compose and deliver a sermon, which impeaches
all monarchy, and teaches that it is lawful to kill all Kings;
that he is guilty of a most seditious act and a high misde∣meanour,
and is therefore punishable, who can doubt? But
it seems difficult, out of this general precept, nowise ap∣plied,
nor more specially illustrated, to make a treason of
compassing the King's death. For, though it be of evil in∣fluence
in that respect; it does not prove any resolution or
purpose of the writer against the life of our Sovereign;
nor can be accounted such a measure as tends directly to
his destruction. But, if the book or discourse, either open∣ly,
or by plain insinuation, arraign <HI>our Sovereign</HI> as a ty∣rant,
and maintain the right, and also the expediency
of killing him, as in the situation of the country, and of
public affairs at the time; and if it insist on all the suit∣able
topics for encouragement of the King's subjects to such
an attempt; this, in sound construction, and according to the
<PB N="418" REF="419"/>
language of Hale, seems <HI>to import such a compassing</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Accordingly in the trial of John Twyn, printer, February 20. and 22. 1663, for printing and publishing a book, which not only laboured with the people to cast off their allegiance, but in direct terms exhorted them to put his Majesty to death, this was held to be clear treason. And he had judgment accordingly. See St. Tr. vol. ii. p. 527. In the case of Edward Fitzharris, March 25. 1681; things were carried farther. But I do not mention this case as a precedent. See St. Trials, vol. iii. p. 287.</NOTE>. For
it cannot reasonably be denied of the person who delibe∣rately
publishes an argument and exhortation of this kind,
that he has the purpose of the King's death in his heart,
and has taken a material and most dangerous step towards
the accomplishment of his design. If he should use the like
exhortation to but one proselyte in private, or should write
a letter to any one enforcing the same topics, this would
certainly be treason: and is the exhortation the less wicked,
or the less dangerous, for being addressed to the people at
large?</P>
<P>WITH respect to words that are uttered and spoken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Do Words a∣mount to an overt Act?</NOTE>
the general rule, laid down by all authorities (excepting
Hawkin's<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 39. No. 33.</NOTE>, who speaks more doubfully), seems to be this;
that be they ever so wicked and abominable, they do not at
common law, nor under the statute of Edward, amount to
treason, but to a high misdemeanour only; so they be mere
loose words, not relative to any act or design: such as ex∣pressions
of hatred to the King, prayers and wishes for his
death, curses or invectives against him, or even threats and
denunciations of mischief. And certainly there is great
reason for distinguishing with respect to treason, between
spoken words and written. Because the former are often∣times
no deeper than the lips, and rather argue the heat
<PB N="419" REF="420"/>
of temper, than the malice of the heart; beside that they
are so liable to be mistaken, misconstrued, perverted, or im∣perfectly
remembered by the hearers; whereas a writing is a
deliberate and advised act, and always testifies for itself,
what it is, and was meant by the writer to be<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 111. <HI>et seq.</HI>—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 80.—Foster, p. 200. No. 7.—Coke, 3. Inst. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But Words ex∣pound Acts into Treason.</NOTE> to be just or rational, this rule must be un∣derstood
with certain qualities and limitations; for we should
form a very false notion of the law if we conceived it to
stand thus, that words are utterly indifferent in this matter,
and in no circumstances can amount to treason. All consul∣tation
and debate, though purely verbal, how to kill the
King, or towards the levying of war to imprison or depose
him, is an undoubted overt act of compassing his death; be∣cause
the words in such a case are not the evidence only
of the traiterous purpose, but an act and measure in prose∣cution
of it, and which tends to the advancement of the pro∣ject.
In like manner, by advice, or by argument and per∣suasion
to instigate any one to kill the King, is certainly
treason, though all pass in the form of words between the
parties personally present; and though there be no evidence
of the traiterous purpose, but this very instigation. <HI>A fortiori,</HI>
therefore, if there be any act or deed in the case to which
the words refer; or which they apply and explain, as to the
meaning and scope of it, or the <HI>animus</HI> with which it is
done; the words are here most material to the charge, and
as they are or are not proved may determine the issue of the
trial. For instance, the giving of money to A or B, may,
according to circumstances, be either a virtuous or a criminal
<PB N="420" REF="421"/>
act, or in a great measure indifferent. But if it is given
upon condition of killing the King, or as the reward of
that stipulated service; and if this is proved by the words
which pass on the occasion; then is this act explained and
characterised after such a manner, as makes it an overt act
of treason; which it would not otherwise be. Such a case,
and mentioned in that view by Hale and Foster, was the case
of Crohagan an Irish priest, in the reign of Charles I. who
was charged, “That being at Lisbon in Portugal he used
these words, <HI>I will kill the King if I can come at him,</HI>” after
which he actually came to England, and was there taken.
Of itself, the man's coming into England was very innocent;
but explained as it was by this speech, to have been with in∣tent
to kill the King, it became a decisive overt act of trea∣son;
and the person had judgment accordingly. In short,
words may be so joined to an act in an indictment of treason,
as to make the same applicable to, and expositive of, a com∣passing
of the King's death; which act, if not so expounded
and applied, would not be an overt act of treason, nor make
a good indictment of itself<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 115, 116.—Foster, p. 202, 203.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the person whose death is compassed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is a King in this Question.</NOTE>—it seems
to be agreed that a Queen regnant, (but not the husband of
such a one) is within the meaning of the act; which is like∣wise
true of the heir of the King from the moment of his
predecessor's death, though not yet crowned<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 101—Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 36. No. 19, 20.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 76, 77.</NOTE>. Also it seems
not to be disputed, that the statute applies to the King
<HI>de facto,</HI> to him who is in plenary possession of the Crown,
though without rightful pretensions, equally as to the King
<PB N="421" REF="422"/>
<HI>de jure.</HI> The reason of this lies in his administration of the
laws and government for the time, and in the protection
thence derived by the inhabitants of the realm; in return for
which they owe him duty and allegiance, while his possession
shall endure.</P>
<P>FROM this, on the other side it follows, that the rightful
heir of the Crown, during such time as the usurper is in ple∣nary
possession, and while no possession is in the heir, (as
was the case with the House of York, during the reigns of
Henry IV. V. and VI.) is not a King within the sense of
the act of Edward, against whom any treason can be com∣mitted.
In conformity to which principle, the statute 11th
Henry VII. c. 1. has pronounced all persons excused of any
penalty or forfeiture, on account of assistance or obedience,
whether in the field or otherwise, rendered to the King in
possession for the time. This in truth can only be esteemed
declaratory of the common law; as it were certainly against
all reason to prescribe the duty of allegiance towards a So∣vereign,
how rightful soever, who is in no condition to pro∣tect
any one against the power or violence of the usurper.</P>
<P>WHAT has now been said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is a King in this Question.</NOTE> seems to be justly applicable to
the case of the rightful heir, who has never been in posses∣sion
nor vested with the character of King; and to whom,
as he has never yielded any protection, no allegiance can be
due. But it may be doubted how far the same will hold in
the case of the rightful King who has once been in possession,
and is turned out for a time by an usurpation; which not∣withstanding,
he maintains his claim, continues to bear his
style and title of King, and finally repossesses himself of the
throne of his inheritance. This at least is the opinion of Sir
<PB N="422" REF="423"/>
Mathew Hale<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 104. No. 1.</NOTE>, which I do not find expressly contravert∣ed
by other authorities, but rather avoided to be touch∣ed
on. Yet it may require to be considered, whether to
make this doctrine either equitable in itself, or consistent
with what has already been said, a distinction must not be
received between those acts of compassing, which may be
necessary in compliance with the usurper's dominion for the
time, and out of dread of his power and vengeance; and
those voluntary attempts which proceed from the will and
affections of the party. Thus to be in arms, and in the
field against the rightful Sovereign, in his attempt to repos∣sess
himself of the throne, ought not to be construed treason;
because perhaps the party dare not, for his personal safety,
decline the service. But secretly, and of free-will, or for
bribe and reward, to attempt to assassinate or poison the King
<HI>de jure,</HI> though out of possession, is an act of a different and
quite inexcusable nature; and which seems properly to fall
under the rule laid down by Sir Mathew Hale, who, per∣haps,
only intended it for cases of this description.</P>
<P>IT is farther to be observed with respect to the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen and Prince, if with∣in the Act.</NOTE> and
the King's eldest son, that though they also are within the
words of the statute, yet they are not so in the same ample and
plenary construction, as is the King himself; for their charac∣ters
and stations are absolutely different. The Sovereign is
such; one in whom the nation has the highest possible inte∣rest;
and who, as long as the government subsists, cannot
be laid under any manner of force or restraint: whereas,
viewed with respect to him, the Queen and Prince are sub∣jects,
capable of doing wrong, and liable to the controul and
coercion of law. Hence it comes to pass, that there are
<PB N="423" REF="424"/>
certain overt acts of compassing the King's death, which are
personal and appropriate to the King, and his sovereign power
and royal dignity; and are not applicable to the Queen or
Prince. The compassing for instance, to depose the Queen,
or to constrain or imprison the Prince, is not treason; be∣cause
there are situations of offence and misdemeanour on
the part of those personages, where they are lawfully subject
to that sort of process. With respect to them, the com∣passing
is therefore only to be understood of those acts,
which go to a direct attempt upon their lives by force or
poison<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 127, 128.</NOTE>; and even against these the Queen enjoys the pro∣tection
of the treason-laws as long only as she is the Queen
Consort, the King's wife, and during the subsistance of the
marriage between them<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, <HI>ib.</HI> p. 124.</NOTE>. Neither does any heir to the
Crown enjoy it, unless he be the King's son: no collateral
heir enjoys it, nor even the eldest daughter of the King,
when there is no son; unless by special provision of the statute
for the case<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hale, <HI>ib.</HI> p. 125, 126.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. THE second point of treason set down in the act of
Edward is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violation of the Queen or Prin∣cess.</NOTE> “If a man do violate the King's companion or
the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the
King's eldest son and heir.” Which is not a mere jealous
and proud provision of the law, on the notion solely of the
personal contempt and insult to the Royal Family (though
certainly these are not to be overlooked); but is grounded in
a most substantial reason of public interest, the expediency
of guarding the blood-royal against all suspicion of bastar∣dy,
and the nation against the manifold evils of a disputed
<PB N="424" REF="425"/>
succession to the Crown. In this article, as in the last, only
the Consort of the King and Prince, still in life, is with∣in
the act; but the eldest daughter is within it, though
there be sons existing, who are before her in the succes∣sion
to the Crown. In the case of all these persons, it is
equally treason whether the carnal knowledge be by force
or by consent; and equally in the woman consenting as in
the man<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, 128, 129—Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 37. No. 22.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>III. THE third species of treason is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levying of War against the King.</NOTE> “If a man do levy
war against our Lord the King. within his realm.” Which
description, though short, includes three things: There
must be a levying of war;—It must be levied against the
King;—and it must be levied within his realm.</P>
<P>1. THERE must be a levying of war. Wherein are exclu∣ded
all consultations, conspiracies, and projects to levy
war, though in themselves complete, and how high soever
their objects; if no war be in pursuance thereof levied<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 38. No. 27.—Foster, p. 211, No. 3.—Hale, vol. i. p. 131.—Blackst, vol. iv. p. 82.</NOTE>
It has, however, been already said, that though ineffec∣tual
in this point of view, such deliberation or conspiracy
will justify an indictment for compassing the King's death;
if the purpose of the meditated insurrection be against the
person or government of the Sovereign.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="426"/>
BUT what shall be construed to be a levying of war? Thus
far seems not to be matter of controversy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is an Act of levying War.</NOTE> that any attack
made upon the King's forces is a sufficient act of hostili∣ty;
if it is not made upon occasional quarrel or special
grudge, but for public reason of enmity to them, as the mi∣litary
power and instruments of the state, and in opposition to
the government of the King. The same is true of the for∣cible
holding out of a castle or fort against the King's troops;
or the fortifying of one's own house, or that of another,
with weapons, defensive or invasive, on purpose to make head
against the King and his power; nay of the bare rai∣sing
and assembling of a force, arrayed in manner of war,
or furnished with weapons bellical, though no manner of
combat or bloodshed ensue<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There are many convictions of treason in the Scots records, upon the ground of holding out a castle against the King, after summons to surrender; and on other the like grounds. See the conviction of Cunningham of Tourlands, Decem∣ber 15. 1601, for keeping out the place of Cunninghamhead;—the case of An∣gus Macdonald and others, July 7. 1615, for holding out the castle of Dunno∣caig, in Isla, against the King's Lieutenant;—the case of Robert Stuart, natural son of the Earl of Orkney, January 3. 1615; and of the Earl himself, as giving mandate to his son, to take and hold out a castle, February 1. 1615;—the case of George Meldrum, January 1604, convicted (<HI>inter alia</HI>) of the treasonable keeping out his house of Dumbreck against the King's guards, sent by order of Privy Council, to demand entrance thereof. In the case of Macleod of Assint, February 2. 16. 1674. it was found relevant, “that after publication of the commission of fire and sword, the pannel did raise or levy 100 men or up∣wards in arms, and put them under officers or military discipline, or swore them to colours, or had them under colours, or drilled them, or put them un∣der daily, weekly, or monthly pay.” As also, “that after such publication, the pannel stuffed, provided, and garisoned the house of Arbreck.”</NOTE>. In the opinion of Foster,
the like holds as to the mere detainer of the King's fort
or castle from him, and the refusal to receive him therein,
<PB N="426" REF="427"/>
though without employment of any other force; if it can
be shown that this is done in confederacy with rebels<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 144, 150, 152. No. 9—Foster, p. 218, 219. No. 9, 10.—Hawkin's, vol. i. p. 38. No. 27.—Hale gives his opinion upon the case of the Earl of Essex, that when the Queen sent the keeper of the Great Seal to him, commanding him to dismiss the armed persons in his house, and to come to her; and he refused to come, and continued the arms and armed persons in his house; and fortisied it against the Queen's officers, this was a levying of war.

<P>BUT it may also happen the general tranquillity to be en∣dangered
by the assembling and continuing together of a
great but more tumultuous and disorderly multitude; who
march in force upon some occasion of a public nature, and
proceed in the execution of an unlawful enterprise, with
a plain intent to defy the authority of the State. How far
this is to be accounted a levying of war, though the persons
are not listed and organised after the fashion of a regular
military force, nor furnished with warlike weapons, but with
such rude instruments only as can be had at the time; this is
a point which in the opinion of Sir Mathew Hale deserved
to be considered, and which he forbore to decide<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 131, 151.</NOTE>. But the
question has since been resolved in the affirmative, by the
judgment in the case of Damaree and Purchase, (commented
on and approved of by Foster);<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 18. &amp; 21. 1710. St. Tr. vol. vi.</NOTE> in which the ground of charge
was the pulling down of the dissenting meetinghouses by a
tumultuous rabble, consisting of some thousands, but armed
only with axes and crows, and other such instruments as
were at hand, and suitable to their purpose<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 208, 211, 212.</NOTE>. The difference
<PB N="427" REF="428"/>
therefore between such cases, and those which are accompa∣nied
with the order and pageantry of war, seems rather to lie
in this; that in the former the charge of treason will only
be good upon the actual execution, in part at least, of the
rebellious purpose of the assembly, by which alone the cha∣racter
of their enterprise is clearly declared; and in the
latter it will be good upon the bare assembling or marching
and continuance in arms, which is itself an act of rebellion,
and ground of terror to the State, as well as a plain evi∣dence
of their deliberate resolution to resist and subdue all
power that shall be sent against them.</P>
<P>2. THE war must be levied against the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The War levied must be against the King.</NOTE> The raising,
therefore, and drawing out of the most regular military
force, nay the actual employment of it in rapine and blood∣shed,
is no treason; if all is done upon a private quarrel, and
to the injury of an individual only or family, without any
hostile view to the authority of the King, or the govern∣ment
of the land. Under this description would fall the
mutual hostilities and depredations, (happily not so frequent
now as they once were), of two Highland clans, arising out
of their casual broils, or hereditary feuds. And thus it was
judged in England, of the quarrel between the Lords March∣ers,
Hereford and Gloucester, in the 20th of Edward I.;
who had mutually made war upon each other, (according to
the custom, they said, of the Lords Marchers), with banners
displayed, and a great power of both horse and foot.</P>
<P>ON the other side, in the construction of law, the levying
of war against the King is not understood of those insur∣rections
only, which have immediate relation to the person
of his Majesty; as if the object be to dethrone or imprison
<PB N="428" REF="429"/>
him, or to drive him out of the realm, or to cause him
alter his measures, or to remove evil counsellors from his
presence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was judged treason in the case of the Earl of Essex, that he marched with an armed body from his house into the city, and there prayed aid of the citizens to bring him into the Queen's presence with a strong hand, that he might re∣move his enemies from about her. But this was laid as an overt act of com∣passing the Queen's death. Hale, vol. i. p. 138, 139.</NOTE>. It equally embraces all those risings, which
though not aimed directly at the person of the King, are
however against his royal Majesty; that is against his Crown
or royal dignity; against his prerogative, authority, or office.
Under this description, according to all authorities, falls an
insurrection for any of these objects: to reform the established
law, religion, or political constitution of the land; or to ob∣tain
redress of national grievances, whether real or imagi∣nary.
For though they be real, the law and government
of the realm, as long as they subsist, cannot know any
thing of this course of correcting them; nor make ac∣count
of it as any other than rebellion against the King,
who, as head of the State, is bound to prevent all such for∣cible
interference of private persons with his own functions,
or those of the legislative power. And with regard to those
rare and extraordinary situations of oppression, which justify
a whole nation in rising to assert their rights; of these there
is no room to speak: for as the government itself is dis∣solved
in that case, so for such situations there can be no
rule in the law of any country<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 210, 211. No. 3, 4.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 81, 82.—Hale, vol. i. p. 152, 131, 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS constructive levying of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constructive le∣vying of War against the King.</NOTE> is understood in even a
larger sense than in any of these instances; and such as ap∣plies
<PB N="429" REF="430"/>
it to all systematic and extensive opposition of the laws
and executive authority of the realm, in matters of general
concern. Thus to pull down all prisons and courts of justice,
or all customhouses and houses of revenue; to throw open
all inclosures; to raise all wages of labour; to abate all rents
and prices of provisions; to hinder the collection or pay∣ment
of all taxes; to prevent the trial of all traitors: all
these alarming and extensive projects of forcible opposition
to the King's laws <HI>generally,</HI> are, by construction, within
the clause of the statute as to levying of war. For if the
persons who are concerned in the maintaining and enforcing
of those matters shall resist and oppose this usurpation, accord∣ing
to their duty; then is the whole country involved in ho∣stility,
and it cannot be foreseen to what other new objects
the rebellion thus set on foot may extend itself. It is no less
obvious, that beside their immediate tendency to unhinge
the whole frame of society, such enterprises are in a pecu∣liar
manner against the King's Majesty as protector of his
people, dispenser of justice, and Supreme Executive Magi∣strate;
to whom is entrusted the defence of property, and
the conservation of peace, and of the established order of
things. That no ill is intended to the person of the King,
is not material; if his office and authority are forcibly de∣fied
in any thing which by the law and his prerogative he
has right or is bound to do in the government, as King<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 132. <HI>et seq.</HI>—Foster, p. 211, 212.—Hawkins, vol. i. p. 37. No. 25.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE noted instance of the application of this principle
was in the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constructive le∣vying of War against the King. April 18. 21. 1710.</NOTE> already mentioned, of Damaree and Pur∣chase;
whose enterprise, undertaken on occasion of the ac∣quittal
<PB N="430" REF="431"/>
of Dr Sacheverell, was to pull down <HI>all</HI> the dissenting
meetinghouses<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Foster, p. 214, 215.</NOTE>, and for which they both had judgment, as
for an act of levying of war against the King. The same
had been ruled in the 20th of Charles II. by the opinion of
all the Judges except Sir Mathew Hale, in the case of an
armed convocation of apprentices in the city of London,
who assembled to pull down <HI>all</HI> bawdy houses<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 134. Peter Massenger, and others▪ were tried on 4th April 1668, for assembling with weapons, and proceeding under a Captain, and with an Ensign, to pull down bawdyhouses. The Court gave this opinion: “By levying of war is not only meant when an army is gathered together, as an army is, but if a company of people will go about any public reformation, this is high treason, if it be but to pull down inclosures; for they take upon them the regal authority. These people do pretend their design was against bawdyhouses. Now, for men to go about to pull down houses, under the pretence of bawdyhouses, with a Cap∣tain, and an Ensign, and weapons; if this thing be endured, who is safe?” St. Trials, vol. ii. p. 587.</NOTE>, and demolished
several in prosecution of their purpose. The like opinion had
governed in the construction of another of the treason laws,
the statute of the 13th of Elizabeth, c. 1. under which it
was treason even to <HI>conspire or intend</HI> to levy war against the
King. For in the case of Grant and others, in the 37th of
Elizabeth, it was judged to be treason within this statute,
that the apprentices in London had conspired and assembed
with intent to kill the Lord Mayor, to burn his house, and
deliver certain of their companions who had been impri∣soned
by the Mayor, on account of a proclamation made
by them concerning the price of victuals. In the trial like∣wise
of Robert Burton and others, the same statute was
held to reach the case of a conspiracy to rise in arms, and
set out upon a general enterprise of pulling down inclosures<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 144, 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="432"/>
IT is obvious that such projects of extensive and systema∣tical
resistance to the laws and the Magistrates of the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction be∣tween levying War and Riot.</NOTE>
are of a more contemptuous character, and involve far more
audacious motives, as well as higher consequences, than those
sudden and limited disturbances which arise from special
grudge and provocation; or are calculated to get rid of some
local grievance, in which the offenders themselves have, or
think they have, a peculiar concern. A rising for instance
to throw open a certain common, to pull down a certain
gaol, to hinder the execution of such a criminal, or to abate
the price of grain in the market of a certain place: this
does not involve hostility to the State, nor any general plan
of spreading rebellion against the law or government; and
though severely punishable as a riot, is, however, in compari∣son
of the other instances, a mere private outrage or effusion of
passion, which could not with propriety be made the ground
of a charge of treason. Upon this distinction it was, that
on occasion of those two noted commotions in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 1725. Mar. 1737.</NOTE>
commonly called <HI>Shawfield's mob</HI> and the <HI>Porteous mob,</HI> though
not altogether void of some affinity to a levying of war, it
was yet judged proper to proceed against the offenders as
guilty of the lower offence. It is true, that in the one instance
there was an interference with the course of the royal mercy,
by the execution of a capital convict who had been re∣prieved;
and in the other, the house of a member of Parlia∣ment
had been pillaged and demolished, in resentment of his
conduct in that capacity, on occasion of the passing of a cer∣tain
revenue law. But as it was plain, upon the whole cir∣cumstances
of the case of <HI>Porteous,</HI> that there was no im∣peachment
among the multitude of the royal prerogative
of mercy, nor any project of opposition to it <HI>generally;</HI>
but only a quarrel with the exercise of it in a parti∣cular
<PB N="432" REF="433"/>
instance, and on account of special enmity of the of∣fenders
to the person who was the object of mercy; the crime
was therefore justly held not to be treason, but a case of riot
only and murder. The same judgment was properly given
with respect also to the other case: because all was done with
the purpose of injury to the particular man, with whom, as
their representative, the offenders were peculiarly connec∣ted;
and not as part of any great combination for resistance
of the tax every where, and abuse of all concerned in
the passing or executing of the law; for in that case it would
have amounted to treason<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See case of Maclauchlane, March 1737; and of the Darrachs, September 1725.</NOTE>. A more ambiguous case than
either of these, and upon which accordingly the Judges of
England differed in opinion, is that related by Hale, of the
great rising of the weavers, to destroy the engine looms for
weaving ribbons; which resolution they put in practice,
with many circumstances of aggravation, not in one place
only, but in sundry places of several counties. The enter∣prise
was thus, in some sort, of a general nature. But it was
also a particular quarrel, between men of the same trade,
about a particular engine, which they thought a grievance
to them; and in this it was unlike the design of altering re∣ligion
or laws, or pulling down inclosures generally, or en∣tirely
to destroy any trade or calling. The result of the
consultation was, that the offenders were proceeded against,
as for a riot only<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 143. <HI>et seq.</HI>—Foster, p. 210. No. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="434"/>
IN the close of all, it may be observed of these construc∣tive
ways of levying war, which have no immediate relation
to the person or government of the King, that the bare
conspiracy to engage in them is not an overt act of compass∣ing
the King's death; as it is where the intended war is to
dethrone, imprison, or constrain the King, or to have any
power over him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 213. No. 6. Opinion of Ch. J. Holt in the case of Sir John Friend.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. THE war must be levied against the King <HI>within his
realm.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">War must be within the Realm.</NOTE> But it is held in this question that the narrow seas
are within the ligeance of the Crown of England; so that
to assail any of the King's ships, (which are so many royal
castles), upon those seas, is a levying of war within the
realm.</P>
<P>IV. THE article immediately subjoined to that of levying
war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adherence to the King's Ene∣mies.</NOTE> is of a nature nearly allied to it, and is thus described
in the statute. “If a man be adherent to the King's ene∣mies
within the realm, giving to them aid or comfort
within the realm or elsewhere.” There are two kinds
of warlike force, against which the law has to provide secu∣rity
to the King. There is the hostility on the part of
rebels, who have broken the allegiance which they owe to
his Majesty, and whom to aid or comfort is a levying of
war, either direct or constructive, under the clause of the
statute last examined; and there is the hostility on the part
of foreign and open enemies, who owe no such allegiance,
and who if taken in arms, could not themselves be demean∣ed
as traitors, (having broken no bond of subjection), but
would be treated as prisoners of war. Those, however, of
<PB N="434" REF="435"/>
his Majesty's subjects who adhere unto such open enemies;
who, contrary to their allegiance, give them aid and comfort,
are in a far more unfavourable situation; and in terms of
this clause, which rests upon the most substantial reasons of
policy and justice, are subject to the pains of treason, though
the enemies to whom they adhere are not. The same acts
of assistance, which if lent to rebels would make a levying
of war, being lent to enemies, are of course acts of treason∣able
adherence within the statute.</P>
<P>SUCH it clearly is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of treason∣able adherence.</NOTE> to join and march with the enemy in war∣like
array<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the trial of Stirling of Keir, and others, November 22. 1708, (the last trial for treason upon the law of Scotland), the Court sound “the said pannels, their rising and continuing in arms without her Majesty's authority, and actually corresponding with an open enemy upon the coast, ready to in∣vade this part of Great Britain▪ called Scotland, relevant to infer the pains of treason libelled against the pannels.”</NOTE>; or to cruise under his command or commission in
a ship of war at sea, though no fighting ensue, (as was ruled
in Vaughan's case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Trials, vol. v. p. 37.</NOTE> November 6. 1696); or to remain in his
service and take his pay, though without any pointed act of
personal hostility to Britain; or any how to accompany and
be attached to the enemy's force: so the prisoner have not the
excuse of compulsion by reasonable fear of injury to his life
or person, (for fear of mischief to lands or goods will not
suffice); which defence it lies on him to prove. The same is
true of all voluntary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending of intelligence to the enemy, or
of arms, provisions, or warlike stores; and of the surren∣dering

ships of war, if it does not happen out of cowardice or mis∣conduct,
but upon bribe or reward, or in any sort of com∣bination

or understanding with the enemy<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 216, 217. No. 8; 219. No. 11.—Hale, vol. i. p. 167, 168.—Hawkins, vol. i. p. 38. No. 28.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 83. In the case of William and John Riddell, November 7. 1681, “The Lords find the defence proponed for the pannel relevant, he always proving <HI>vis major,</HI> and force to every act of furnishing the rebels with meat and drink, and assisting them in carrying of their cannons, to eleid that part of the libel.” “The assize find that the woman did carry ale, and did deliver ale and bread to be carried to the rebels; but finds it not proven, that the pannel William Riddell had any accession thereto; and as to the furnishing of malt libelled, they all in one voice assoilzied the pannel <HI>simpliciter,</HI> because he was compelled thereto.” Upon the 21st November, the pannel was dissmissed upon taking the test. In the case of Mackie of Drumbowie, December 11. 14. 18. 1682, the Court found it relevant to eleid the libel, that he never was with the rebels but once at a certain place, and went thither to dissuade them, and actually did so, and straightway left them.” Upon verdict finding that he had been with the rebels at other places, and that the occasion on which he dissuaded, was different from that libelled, he had sentence as a traitor.</NOTE>. Nay, in the
opinion of Hale, we are to hold the same of him who shall
take an oath of fealty or allegiance to the enemy, freely,
and not being constrained thereto by fear of his life; nor
having it in view to gain his freedom thereby, and return
to his duty<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the 27th December 1665, Colonel John Kirkpatrick, and several other persons, Scots officers in the service of the States of Holland, were fugitate upon a libel for treason. They had continued in the service of the States, after the breaking out of the war with Britain; and had taken an oath which was exacted of them, disowning all fidelity and obedience to any but the States.</NOTE>. The remaining abroad in an enemy's country,
where the person has been before the breaking out of war,
were it even after proclamation ordering all British subjects
to return home, though it may be a circumstance along with
others, in a proof of adherence, will not however make
an adherence, of itself. And indeed, even an invitation to a
foreign power that is in peace and amity with Britain,
to invade and levy war upon us, is not such an act as
<PB N="436" REF="437"/>
can be tried under this clause, (though it is an act of com∣passing
the King's death); because there is no enemy at the
time of the solicitation, to whom it can be construed an ad∣herence<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 165, 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is construed an enemy.</NOTE> who shall be construed a
proper enemy, this is a question of fact; and is to be tried
by the jury, not upon the single circumstance of indiction
or proclamation of war, (which is now almost a forgotten ce∣remony),
but upon the actual state and condition of things
between the two countries, as it is or is not a state of open
hostility. Nay it is not always necessary to allege even so
much as this. The name of enemy in this question applies
not only to a King or State in enmity, but to every alien
who comes into Great Britain in open hostility; so that if
the subject of a foreign state which is in peace and amity
with Britain, shall, without a commission from his Sove∣reign,
come against this country to invade it, any aid or
comfort lent to this public enemy is equally a treasonable
adherence, as if it were lent to a more regular and systema∣tic
war<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 163, 164—Foster, p. 219, 220.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 83.—Case of Vaughan. St. Trials, vol. v. p. 34.</NOTE>. It is also all one, according to Foster<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 220. No. 12.</NOTE>, in a case
of open war, whether the acts of adherence which are char∣ged
have been committed directly against the King and his
forces, or against his allies and their forces, carrying on war
against the common enemy, whom the prisoner aids, and is
in league with. For by this the common enemy is strength∣ened,
and the King's hands are weakened. This was the
<PB N="437" REF="438"/>
opinion of Lord Chief Justice Holt, in the case of Tho∣mas
Vaughan, November 6. 1696<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">St. Tr. vol. v. p. 34.</NOTE>. Under this, as under
the former articles of the statute, it is not sufficient to charge
the offence generally, as committed at a certain time and
place: The special overt act wherein it consists, and which
is to be given in evidence, must be shown. But in this the
levying of war and the adhering to the King's enemies, are
distinguished by express provision of the statute; that the
war or rebellion must be levied within the realm, and the
adherence may be by aid and comfort given the enemy, ei∣ther
within the realm or elsewhere<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Cases put by Hale, p. 165, 166, 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>V. THE fifth sort of treason set down in the act of Ed∣ward
is, “If a man counterfeit the King's Great or Privy
Seal.” In supplement of this, the act of the 7th of Anne
c. 21. provides, “That if any person counterfeit her Ma∣jesty's
seals appointed by the 24th article of Union to be
kept, used and continued in Scotland, that the doing there∣of
shall be construed and adjudged to be treason.”</P>
<P>VI. ONE treason more, mentioned in the act of Edward
is, “If a man counterfeit the King's money; or if a man
bring false money into this realm, counterfeit to the mo∣ney
of England, as the money called Lusburgh or other,
like to the said money of England, knowing the money
to be false, to merchandise or make payment, in deceit of
our Lord the King and of his people.” Under these words,
according to Hawkins and Hale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">B. 1. c. 17. No. 69. B. 1. c. 20. p. 229.</NOTE> who in this argue against
the opinion of Lord Coke, the gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is attached to the act
of importing counterfeit British money with <HI>intent</HI> to mer∣chandise
<PB N="438" REF="439"/>
or make payment therewith, though no payment
be made. Those who coin the King's money are guilty
of treason, whether they utter it or not; but the bare ut∣tering,
without participation in the counterfeiting or im∣porting,
does not fall within the words of this clause. Nei∣ther
is any but gold or silver coin held to be the King's
money in the sense of the statute; much less any thing that
is counterfeited after the similitude of a foreign coin, even
though made current here by proclamation<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Hale, vol. i. p. 227. No. 2.—Hawkins, vol. i. p. 42. No. 55, 56, 57.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 84.</P>
<P>By statute 16th Geo. II. c. 28. the coining of copper money is punished with two years imprisonment; by the 11th Geo. III. c. 40. it is made felony; as it also is to buy, sell, take, receive, pay or put off, any counterfeit copper money, at a lower rate than the same by its denomination doth import.</P>
<P>In September 1729, William Deane, indicted of counterfeiting and uttering halfpence, was tried not as for treason, but by our ordinary forms, and on con∣viction he had sentence of pillory and transportation.</P></NOTE>. But of this
more at large, when we come to treat of the new and in∣stituted
treasons; of which the greater part have relation to
the coin.</P>
<P>VII. THE only other treason set down in the act of Ed∣ward
is, “If a man slay the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the
King's Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in
Eyre, or Justices of Assize, and all other Justices assigned
to hear and determine, being in their places doing their
offices.”</P>
<P>IN this article also, the Supreme Judges of the two king∣doms
have been placed upon an equal footing of dignity and
security, by the said act of the 7th of Anne. It provides,
that if any person shall slay any of the Lords of Session, or
Lords of Justiciary sitting in judgment in the exercise of their
<PB N="439" REF="440"/>
office within Scotland, that the doing thereof shall be con∣strued,
adjudged, and taken to be high treason<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are some of the chief Scottish treasons, of a public and in∣teresting nature, which were abolished by the communication of the law of Eng∣land. By statute 1584, c. 130. it was treason to impugn the dignity, or to seek or procure the diminution of the power of authority of the three Estates of Par∣liament, or any of them. It was upon this statute, along with other grounds, that James Skene had sentence as a traitor, on the 22d November 1680. He had publicly disclaimed the authority of King and Parliament, in all matters con∣trary to the Covenant; and to this opinion, he with unshaken firmness adhered, first before the Council, and afterwards upon his trial, to the Court and jury; and professed that he held it an honour to bear testimony with his blood to such a doctrine.</P>
<P>By the act 1584, c. 129. it was declared, that the King was judged compe∣tent to persons of every estate, degree, or function, spiritual or temporal, in all matters wherein they should be called to answer before him, or his Council; and to decline the authority of him, or his Council therein, was made treason. This act was principally levelled against the troublesome ecclesiastics of the time, who, under pretence of speaking to matters of church government, filled the pulpits with sedition, and inflamed the people with jealousy and hatred of the temporal powers; and when called to answer for such conduct before the King and Council, they declined their authority as in a spiritual matter. But this act seems very rarely to have been executed <HI>ad rigorem.</HI> In 1596, one Black, a minister, con∣victed upon the statute, was dismissed with a slight censure. On the 10th Janua∣ry 1606, John Forbes, and other five ministers, also convicted on the statute, were banished the King's dominions. In August 1610, Andrew Crichton was indeed condemned to die, as mentioned by Mackenzie; but this sentence was commuted for banishment, February 27. 1611. This too was one of the charges-against Ogilvy, who suffered death in 1615; but he was also charged as a Jesuit, and with the saying of mass, and asserting the jurisdiction of the Pope, which was a capital offence of itself.</P>
<P>The act 1661, c. 3. declares his Majesty's prerogative in the calling and dis∣solving of Parliament, and the necessity of his consent to the passing of any act; and makes it treason to impugn the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, or call it in question.</P>
<P>If offences of this nature, which were properly acts of sedition, were to be punished with the pains of treason, it would have been proper to employ more definite terms in the description of them, as well as to have distinguish∣ed the different ways of committing them, whether by writing and printing, or by advised, or unadvised discourse. Several additions were made to this description of treasons by these statutes: 1689, c. 1. c. 2. 1703, c. 1. c. 3.; by the last of which, it was made treason by writing, advised speaking, or open deed, to impugn, or endeavour to alter the claim of right.</P>
<P>Mackenzie has shortly taken notice of that point of treason which consisted in abiding frae the host, that is in failure to obey the King's summons to the field, in case of rebellion or invasion of enemies. Against such defaulter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the statute 1424, c. 4. provided, that they should be proceeded against as favourers of the rebels. And in the case of John Connell, John Wight, John Allan, and others, April 20. 21. 1599, judgment accordingly passed, declaring the forfeiture of all their lands and goods, and appointing their persons to be warded during the pleasure of the King. That ever judgment of death was given against a defaulters as a proper traitor, I do not find. And, in later times, after the establishment of a more re∣gular military force, even the forfeiture of lands was laid aside for punishment by fine. There are many prosecutions upon this ground in the years 1679 and 1680, for failure to assist in suppressing the rebels in the well. However, by a letter of the 26th November 1679, the King consented that the fine should not be carried beyond two years rent of the offender's estate; and that deserters, though punishable with death, should be proceeded against as absents. The truth seems to be, that the law was used at this time as an engine for drawing money from the disaffected. See March 9.; February 23. 26. 1680.</P></NOTE>.</P>

VIII. SOMETHING shall now be added respecting certain
instituted and statutory treasons of a later date;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treasons rela∣tive to the Pro∣testant Succes∣sion.</NOTE> some of
which are in effect exceptions to the construction which
the act of Edward would have received. It has been said
that words, even though committed to the forms of wri∣ting
or printing, and much more if only uttered, are not
a sufficient overt act of treason, reducible to any of the
heads of that enactment; if they are only words of specu∣lation
and opinion, not of exhortation or direct advice to
some act against the King, or such as necessarily tend to
<PB N="441" REF="442"/>
his immediate danger. It would not, for instance, be treason
under the act of Edward (though, as a slander, and tending
to disaffection, it would be punishable at common law) to de∣ny
the King's title to the Crown, or to affirm the title of an∣other
in preference of him, or to deny the right of Parliament
to bind the succession of the Crown by laws. But the particu∣lar
circumstances of these realms considered, with respect to
a point so interesting to the national freedom and tranquil∣lity,
it has been thought warrantable to innovate upon this
rule, by a special provision for security of the Protestant suc∣cession.
The act of the 6th of Anne, c. 7. which passed at
the time of a projected invasion by the then Pretender, and
is copied from a temporary statute of Elizabeth, has there∣fore
made it treason, advisedly and directly, by writing or
printing, to maintain and affirm, that any person has right
to the Crown of these realms, otherwise than according to
the act of settlement; or that the Kings of this realm, with
the authority of Parliament, are not competent to make
laws and statutes to bind the Crown and the descent there∣of<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">To do the same thing maliciously and directly, but only by preaching, teach∣ing, or advised speaking, (without writing or printing), does, by the same statute, subject to the penalties of a <HI>praemunire;</HI> which are the forfeiture of lands and te∣nements, goods and chat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els, and imprisonment during the King's pleasure. Even to maintain the same things heedlessly, in common and unadvised discourse, is accounted a contempt which may be punished by imprisonment and fine. By statute 6th Anne, c. 23. it is also a <HI>praemunire</HI> if the Peers of Scotland, assem∣bled to elect their representatives, shall presume to treat of any matter but the election.</NOTE>. By a prior statute, 1st Anne, St. 2. c. 17. it had also been
made treason, by any direct and overt act, to endeavour to
hinder the succession of any person to the Crown, being the
next in succession according to the limitations of the act of
settlement.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="443"/>
OTHER interpositions have also been made with a view to
the same important object. By statute 13th and 14th of
William III. c. 3. it was made treason, by letters, messages,
or otherwise, to hold correspondence with the then Pretend∣er,
or any one employed for him, or knowingly to remit
money for his use. By statute 17th George II. c. 39. the
same is declared with respect to correspondence with any of
his sons, or the remitting of money to their use; as well as
it is made treason for any of those persons to land, or at∣tempt
to land in this Kingdom, or to be found in Great Bri∣tain
or Ireland, or any of the dominions belonging to the
same.</P>
<P>IX. The second branch of instituted treasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treasons relative to the Prote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant Religion.</NOTE> is nearly
related to the first; and includes those extraordinary provi∣sions,
which have been thought necessary towards the securi∣ty
of the reformed religion, and the exclusion of the Popish:
a matter which, on account of the strict connection of the
latter with certain temporal doctrines and principles of go∣vernment,
has been the object of the peculiar anxiety of the
Legislature. In this view, the adherents of the Popish com∣munion
have been made liable to many civil disabilities, and
inferior penalties, which shall be taken notice of in their pro∣per
place. But the offences of this sort, which have been
reckoned of so heinous a degree as to deserve being placed in
the rank of treason, are only three in number. By statute 27th
Elizabeth, c. 2. if any Popish priest, born in the dominions of
the Crown of England, shall come over hither from beyond
the seas; or shall tarry here three days without conforming
to the church; this is treason. By statute 5th Elizabeth,
c. 1. it is also treason, if a person shall be twice convicted of
advisedly maintaining or defending the Pope's jurisdiction,
<PB N="443" REF="444"/>
heretofore claimed in this realm. By 13th Elizabeth,
c. 2. Parl. 2. and 3. it is treason to put in ure any bull, or in∣strument
of absolution or reconciliation, obtained from the
see of Rome<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Hawkins, vol. i. p. 44. No. 75.</NOTE>. And by statute 3d James I. c 4. if any natu∣ral
born subject be withdrawn from his allegiance, and re∣conciled
to the see of Rome, or any other Prince or State,
this is treason in the person reconciled, and in those who
procure him to be so: nay the mere attempt to persuade any
one to such apostacy, seems, by the words of the act, to stand
in the same degree of guilt.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> No. 78.</NOTE></P>
<P>X. THE third and last sort of special statutory treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treasons rela∣tive to the Coin of the Realm.</NOTE> is
one which comes more into practice than either of the others;
and relates to the injuring or falsifying of the current coin of
the realm. It has been said that this matter was touched up∣on
in the statute of Edward, but only as to two species of traffic
in false coin; so that in later times, according to the progress
of ingenuity and invention in this gainful sort of fraud, large
additions have been thought necessary to be made to this part
of the code of treason. 1. By 1st Mary, St. 2. c. 6. it is
treason to counterfeit any foreign coin of gold or silver, that is
current within this realm by consent of the Crown; or to
forge the sign manual, Privy Signet, or Privy Seal. 2. By
1st and 2d Philip and Mary, c. 11. it is also treason to bring
into the realm any such false or counterfeit foreign mo∣ney,
to the intent to merchandise therewith; under which
words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hale, vol, i; p. 229. Hawkins, b. 1. c. 17. No. 69.</NOTE> in the opinion of Hale and Hawkins the import∣ing
<HI>eo animo,</HI> without actual uttering, is sufficient. 3. By
5th Elizabeth, c. 11. whoever shall wash, clip, round or
file, and by 18th of Elizabeth, c. 1. whoever shall impair,
diminish, falsify, scale or lighten the proper coin of this
<PB N="444" REF="445"/>
realm, or that of other realms made current here by procla∣mation,
is to be deemed an offender in high treason. 4. By
8th and 9th William III. c. 26. made perpetual by 7th Anne,
c. 25. whoever shall knowingly make or mend, buy or sell,
or have in his possession, any instruments proper only for the
coinage of money, or shall convey such instruments out of
the King's mint, shall be guilty of treason. 5. The statute
declares the same, with respect to him who shall mark any
coin on the edges after the manner used in the mint, or shall
colour, gild, or case over any coin resembling the cur∣rent
coin, or even round blanks of base metal. In the 6th
and last place, by statute 15th and 16th, Geo. II. c. 28. he
also is to suffer the pains of treason, who shall colour or alter
any current silver coin of this realm, to make it resemble a
gold one, or any copper coin, to make it resemble a coin of
silver.</P>
<P>BEFORE I dismiss this article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May coining be libelled ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst the Scots Sta∣tutes.</NOTE> it may be proper to ob∣serve,
that by the practice of Scotland before the Union,
all the offences above enumerated, were punishable more or
less, and most of them with the highest pains of law. And
here arises a question, which may deserve to be taken notice
of, whether, notwithstanding the general statute which has
raised these offences to the rank of treason, they still re∣tain
their former station also, and may be tried, if the pro∣secutor
pleases, by our ordinary forms, upon a libel which
charges them as falsehoods, and concludes for punishment
according to the law of Scotland. The reasons against it
seem, however, to be strong, and are chiefly these. 1. The
benefit of the new denomination of those offences is not en∣tirely
to the prosecutor, but in some measure to the prison∣er
too; who must have a bill found against him by a grand
jury before he can be tried, and otherwise enjoys all the ad∣vantages,
whatsoever they be, of a trial according to the
<PB N="445" REF="446"/>
English forms. 2. This is not like the case of a new quality
added by statute to a single offence, (as in the case of murder
under trust, or theft in landed men), and which enactment
is consistent with the train of prior laws upon the same mat∣ter.
It is the introduction of an entire new system, rela∣tive
to a whole department of crimes, whereof the rank and
character was meant to be fundamentally altered; so that
the field must be held to be clear of all prior laws upon the
subject, as far as contrary to the new provision. Now that
system is absolute in the direction which it gives, that
these offences shall be taken, adjudged, and deemed to be
treason, and the offenders be tried and punished as offenders
in treason. This point was debated at large in the case of
William Deane, indicted in September 1729, for falsehood and
coining of halfpence; and there the trial proceeded by our
ordinary forms, and the pannel being convicted, had sentence
of pillory and transportation. But as it is clear that the
coining of copper money is not treason, which position also
was fully argued in support of the propriety of the charge;
so it cannot be said that this was a judgment on the point.
In the only other trial for coining that has been since the
Union, that of John Smith, in the Court of Justiciary, July
1749, the prosecution was conducted and brought to an issue
against the prisoner, in all respects as a trial for treason.
But however this may be; certain it is, with respect to all
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ences against the coin which are not treason by the law of
England, that these remain upon the same footing as before
the Union, and liable to prosecution on the Scottish sta∣tutes.
For which reason, I shall afterwards treat of the
Scottish practice touching offences against the coin, as in∣sringements
of the prerogative of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="447"/>
I SHALL now close this enumeration of the different heads
of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Treason all are principals.</NOTE> by taking notice of one circumstance which is
common to them all, viz. That in the language of law,
there are no accessaries in treason, neither before nor after
the fact; the same things that make a person accessary in
other cases, making him principal in treason, on account
of the heinousness of the crime. By incitement, therefore,
or aid towards the commission of an act of treason; or
by comforting or harbouring the traitor after his deed
is done; or by rescuing him from the officers of justice;
or by assisting him to break the gaol, or even allowing him
to escape; a person, in the strictness of the law, becomes
liable to the pains of treason. Indeed, as Foster has ob∣served,
and after him Blackstone; from the very nature
of that head of treason which relates to compassing the death
of the king, there can be no accessaries before the fact;
since the mere preparation, conspiracy, or advice to do the
thing, itself amounts to a principal treason or overt act of
compassing; though the deed in contemplation should never
be done, nor even attempted. In delivering this doctrine,
the later authorities have not even made any express excep∣tion
of those treasons, which relate to the coin or royal
seals<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Hale, vol. i. p. 233. <HI>et seq,</HI>—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 310. No. 2, 3.—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 35.—Foster, p. 341. <HI>et seq.</HI></P>
<P>This of punishing the resetters of rebels, as art and part of the treason, is not however a novelty in the practice of Scotland. There are two strong statutes to that effect, 1424, c. 37. and 1592, c. 146.; which seem in practice to have been applied to the resetting of any one who either had been forfeited in absence, or sugitate and denounced upon libel for treason; or against whom letters of intercom∣muning had issued by warrant from the Privy Council. It even appears from the enactment of the statute 1693, c. 33. that these proceedings had been held to beget an absolute presumption against the resetter, of his knowledge of the qua∣lity and situation, and even of the person of the man whom he harboured; for it requires a proof of the pannel's knowledge of the person from the prosecutor, as a new thing, and in derogation of former practice. Nay, it was decided in more than one case, and especially in these, Ferguson and Cairns, December 11. 1682; and William Lawry, January 31. February 5. 1683; that the same was law with respect to persons, neither denounced nor intercommuned, if they were notour rebels, or persons who were holden and reputed to have been in the rebellion.</P>
<P>In general, it seems to be true, that with respect to all accession, whether be∣fore the fact, by advice, command, instigation or the like, or after it by ratiha∣bition, resetting, concealing, or the like, the practice of Scotland was far more rigorous in the case of treason than of any other crime. In so much that even in the trial of coiners, concealment and resfe seem to have been relevant grounds of charge. The old libels for that crime, <HI>uniformly</HI> charge the pannel, “as art and part, redd, counsel and concealing.” And, on the 3d March 1598, Ralph▪ Wallace has sentence as a traitor, for resetting Hew Brunton a coiner, and allow∣ing him to escape from justice, after being taken.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="448"/>
XI. BEFORE proceeding to the mode of trial for treason, it
may be proper shortly to inquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who may be quilty of Trea∣son.</NOTE> concerning the persons by
whom treason may be committed. The general answer on
this head, naturally arises from the account that has been gi∣ven
of the crime: As it is an infringement of the allegi∣ance
of a subject to the Prince, so all may be guilty of it,
by whom that allegiance is due.</P>
<P>Now, allegiance is not all upon one ground and reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural bor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Subjects.</NOTE> but
of two sorts, natural or local, which are drawn from sour∣ces,
that are in some measure different. The natural, in∣trinsic,
or primitive allegiance, is that which is due by the
natural born subject of Great Britain; he who is born with∣in
the realm, or even out of it (under certain exceptions),
if born of a British father. And which person, as by his
birth he is a member of the society of the inhabitants of
this land; and is protected by its laws and government, at
<PB N="448" REF="449"/>
a season when he is destitute and helpless; and possesses, as
his birthright, (in virtue of his nativity alone), a great va∣riety
of valuable privileges, such as the capacity of landed
property, of public office, of a share in the Legislature, and
the like; so must he stand in a state of strict relation to the
Sovereign, who is the head of that society, and under whose
guardianship and administration all this protection is enjoy∣ed, and these privileges are ensorced and maintained<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 183. No. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As on the one hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Owe perpetual Allegiance.</NOTE> these franchises attach upon the person
(<HI>inhaerent ossibus,</HI> according to the style of law) and can by
nothing but a man's own crime be forfeited; so is the
obligation of allegiance to our King equally permanent and
indefeasible, and what a man can by no act of his own
cast off, nor transfer to another Prince. Go into what part
of the world he may, and let him remain ever so long a
stranger to his native country; yet still he cannot hin∣der
it to be his country, nor make himself another man,
than nature hath made him by his birth<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 96.—Hawkins, vol. i. p. 35. No. 7.—Foster, p. 183, 184.</NOTE>. There was a sig∣nal
instance of the application of this doctrine in the case of
Angus Macdonald, tried on the 10th December 1747. This
person was born in Britain, and of British parents; but he had
been carried to France in early infancy, had received his
education there, and had spent his riper years in a profitable
employment in that kingdom, where his property was fixed,
and all his prospects centered. It was held, that, as a natu∣ral
born subject, he was nevertheless within the law; and
that if in the particular circumstances of his case it were a
<PB N="449" REF="450"/>
hard law, the constitution had provided a resource in the
royal prerogative of mercy. He was accordingly pardon∣ed
upon very favourable terms<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 59. 183, 184.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE local or secondary allegiance again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aliens resident here owe alle∣giance for the time.</NOTE> (but which while
it endures, is no less binding than the other), obliges equally
an alien as a natural born subject; and is due to the Sove∣reign
by every inhabitant of the land, for the time he con∣tinues
in it, by reason of the protection which he receives
in his person and effects, from the Sovereign's administra∣tion
of the government and laws. We have seen, that upon
the very same principle allegiance is even due to an usurper
of the Throne, for the time he is in possession, and while by
his exercise of the Sovereignty he protects the people in the
enjoyment of their rights.</P>
<P>AN alien,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aliens continu∣ing here in time of War with their Prince.</NOTE> therefore, living in Britain, if he is an alien
<HI>ami</HI> (according to the phrase of the law of England), that
is the natural born subject of a State which is in amity with
Britain, shall be dealt with as a traitor, if he commit any
offence which would be treason in a Briton born. Nor will
it even make any difference in his favour, though his Prince,
who was in amity with Britain at the time of this person's
first settlement there, should afterwards come to be an enemy.
His subject has in that case his freedom to withdraw and re∣turn
home, and will be allowed the proper time, and the ne∣cessary
pasports to that end; and if, after having withdrawn,
he shall again appear in Britain <HI>modo guerino,</HI> in guise of open
war as an enemy, then indeed he must be treated as a com∣mon
prisoner of war, if he fall into our hands. But other∣wise,
<PB N="450" REF="451"/>
—if he remain in Britain after the commencement of ho∣stilities,
living privately as a subject, and partaking of the be∣nefit
of our laws and government, in common with the other
inhabitants of the land; in so doing he continues the owning
of his former local allegiance: he hath made his choice of his
condition and his duty; and must be tried as a traitor, if un∣der
this cover and protection, he execute or meditate any
thing against our King, that would be treason in any of his
natural born subjects<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 59, 60. 94. 165.—Foster, p. 185. No. 2, 3.—Hawkins, vol. i. p. 35. No. 5.</NOTE>. Nay it has even been said, (which
is going a much greater length), that though upon the break∣ing
out of war, such alien should himself depart the kingdom;
still his allegiance shall be held to endure, and the treason
laws to apply to him, if he continues his family and effects
within Great Britain, there to receive the cherishment and
comfort of the British laws. This, it seems, was the opinion
of all the Judges, when consulted on the case of Tracey
Price and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foster, p. 185. No. 4.</NOTE> on the 12th January 1707. The like seems
to be law for an enemy coming hither, and staying here
in time of war, upon the King's letter of safe conduct; for
he is under a special protection which puts him in the case
of a subject; in return for which he is bound to abstain from
all practices against our King or his government<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to an alien, who comes into Britain for the first time,
after the breaking out of war with his Prince, but who
comes privately and covertly by himself; such a one can in
nowise be regarded as a subject, but only as a spy, and is to
be dealt with according to the laws of war. For coming
hither in time of war, and not as an <HI>open</HI> enemy, yet with∣out
<PB N="451" REF="452"/>
any public commission from his own Prince, or any safe
conduct from ours, he is not under the protection of our
laws, either as to person or effects: on the contrary he is in
a state of delinquency, and liable to seizure and imprison∣ment,
from the day that he sets a foot within this realm<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale vol. i. p. 94.—Foster, p. 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to the ambassadors of foreign States,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Am∣bassadors.</NOTE> they are in a quite
peculiar situation, and different from that of any other alien.
They are professedly here as the servants, and for the pur∣poses
of the foreign Prince, and, properly speaking, are un∣der
his protection rather than ours. At least, what they re∣ceive
from us is only of an incidental and subordinate na∣ture;
so that for any offences against the State, (unless per∣haps
there be an exception in the case of a direct attempt
upon the life of the King), they cannot be proceeded against
as traitors, but as enemies. For murder indeed, and other
atrocious offences that are against the light of nature, they
are answerable in the ordinary course of justice to the laws
of the country where they are; because whatever may be
thought of their duties with respect to the Crown, they are
for the time members of the civil society of the inhabitants
of this land, and bound to them by the common ties of hu∣manity
as men. But it is true with respect to other crimes,
what Hale has observed, and Foster has assented to, that
such questions will always be rather governed by pruden∣tial
considerations and reasons of State, than by the strict
rules of reason and justice<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 98.—Foster, p. 187.</NOTE></P>
<P>XII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Process for Trea∣son.</NOTE> LET us now attend to the jurisdiction and manner of trial in cases of treason; a matter of great importance, and
<PB N="452" REF="453"/>
which requires to be guarded on both sides with very cau∣tious
provisions: That the law may not be strained against the
prisoner, nor the State be without the due protection from so
high and dangerous a crime. The alterations in this respect
which have been occasioned by the introduction of the law of
England, are perhaps still more considerable, than those in
the nature and description of the offence.</P>
<P>BY the statute of the 7th of Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jurisdiction in Trial for Trea∣son.</NOTE> instead of being pecu∣liar
as formerly to the Court of Justiciary, the trial of trea∣son
is made equally competent to any commission of <HI>oyer and
terminer,</HI> issued in favour of such persons as his Majesty may
appoint; under provision only that three of the Lords of Justi∣ciary
be in such commission, whereof one to be of the quo∣rum.
Farther; at the desire of the Lord Advocate, and upon
a writ of <HI>certiorari</HI> under the Great Seal of Great Britain,
any indictment of treason which is depending either before
such Justices of oyer and terminer, or before the Judges in
the circuit Courts, may be removed for trial into the Court
of Justiciary, in like manner as it may be removed in Eng∣land
into the Court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great alteration is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand Jury must find a Bill.</NOTE> that the prosecution for trea∣son
is not now at the discretion of the Lord Advocate, or
of the Privy Council, who in cases of treason commonly fur∣nished
him with a special warrant to pursue; but upon bill
found by a grand jury of twelve men, who are summoned
and impannelled, and hold their proceedings, according to
the forms of the law of England.</P>
<P>THE petty jury also consist of only twelve persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petty Jury; how composed.</NOTE> instead
of our ordinary number of fifteen; and it appears that these
<PB N="453" REF="454"/>
persons, at least in all trials for treason committed within
the realm, must be taken from the county where the treason
was done<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 2. c. 40. No. 1, 2, 3. This rule was modified with a view to the trials for the last rebellion, by the special statutes 19th Geo. II. c. 9.; 21st Geo. II. c. 19.</NOTE>. In trial for treason committed out of the
realm, this matter is regulated by statute 35th Henry VIII.
c. 2. which directs, that in case of trial before the King's
Bench, the jurors shall be of the county where the court
sits; and in case of trial before commission of oyer and ter∣miner,
that they shall be taken from the shire, assigned by
his Majesty for holding the commission. In either case,
they must he persons possessed of the due qualification; which,
by statute 19th George II. c. 9. is declared to be for Scot∣land,
the possession of lands or tenements of the yearly va∣lue
of 40s. or valued in the tax-rolls at 30s. within the
shire whence the jury comes; but this equally, whether the
possession be as owner or liferenter, and whether in the per∣son's
own right, or that of his wife.</P>
<P>A THIRD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial in absence for Treason.</NOTE> and doubtless a very desirable alteration of the
law, which has ensued upon the statute of the 7th of Anne,
is the abolition of all trial for treason in absence of the ac∣cused.
This was no part of our ancient or customary
law, which had invariably required the presence of the
pannel; but an innovation made for reasons of State, in
an arbitrary reign, and at a period of domestic trouble. This
was after the action with the Covenanters at Pentland Hills,
in November 1666; when the King's servants for Scotland,
not content with the many victims whom the chance of war
<PB N="454" REF="455"/>
threw into their hands, had farther judged it material to the
authority of Government, that the estates of the fugitives
should be laid hold of, and themselves deterred from continu∣ing
in or returning to their country, by the terror of capi∣tal
sentence, ready for execution upon them, on their being
taken. For this purpose, recourse was had to a new and extra∣ordinary
form of process. On the 15th of August 1667, a
libel is called against William Maxwell of Monreith and
others, (for the most part landed men), to the number of 50,
charged either with presence in the action at Pentland, or
with rising in arms in the western counties, or at least with
harbouring and assisting those who had risen. After sen∣tence
of fugitation passed against them in common form, as
non-compearing, the Lord Advocate, Sir John Nisbet of
Dirleton, proposes to the Court to remit the libel to an as∣size;
in order that proof thereof may be taken, and a verdict
found, and doom of death and forfeiture pronounced upon
the pannels if convicted, in the same manner as if they had
appeared for trial. And to prevail with them in this new
request, he produces an opinion of the Judges of the Court
of Session, given upon a memorial which he had laid be∣fore
them, and bearing that this sort of trial in absence for
treason is a competent and lawful process<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“It is their opinion, That upon the Justices citation, and sufficient proba∣tion taken before the Judge and assize, they may proceed and pronounce sen∣tence thereint<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and forfeiture against persons guilty of high treason, though they be absent and cont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acious.”</NOTE>. The reasons ur∣ged
in the memorial are chiefly these. 1. The authority of
the Roman law, which as it is in general our highest autho∣rity,
so special statute 1540, c. 69. has declared the Sove∣reign's
right to pursue all summons of treason, “conforme
to the <HI>common law,</HI> gude equitie, and reason.” 2. The
<PB N="455" REF="456"/>
reason of the thing itself; in as much as it is absurd that the
traitor should have benefit, and the King be injured by his
contumacy, which is an aggravation of his fault. 3. The
practice of Parliament, who are in the use of trying for
treason in absence; and who proceed in this way, not in their
legislative capacity, but as the fountain of justice, and the
Supreme Court of the land. 4. The analogy of the practice
of trying traitors after their death, as allowed by the said
act 1540, c. 69; though the absence in that case be not con∣tumacious,
but necessary. These are the arguments which
had prevailed with the Judges of the Court of Session to
comply with the desires of Government on this occasion, and
to send this legislative measure of the King's ministers to
their brethren of the Criminal Court, sanctified with their
recommendation of it, as a rule of judgment. In deference
to this opinion, the Earl of Athol, Justice-General, and Sir
John Home of Renton, the Justice-Clerk for the time, toge∣ther
with the Earls of Linlithgow and Dumfries, (whom at
their earnest desire the Privy Council had appointed assessors
to the Court), do accordingly proceed in the trial of certain of
these pannels selected by the Lord Advocate; and upon convic∣tion
they declare them to have forfeited their lands, and ad∣judge
them to be executed and demeaned as traitors, at such
times and places as the Court, upon their being taken, shall
appoint.</P>
<P>IT appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of Trial in Absence for Treason.</NOTE> however, (and surely it is not wonderful), that
these proceedings were far from meeting with the general ap∣probation
of the country. To quiet, therefore, the clamour
of the people, and protect the individuals concerned in this
unprecedented judgment, as well as to obviate the objection
in future cases of the same kind; a statute was thought pro∣per
<PB N="456" REF="457"/>
to be passed; the statute 1669, c. 11. which commends
and ratifies these sentences, approves of the Lord Advocate's
good services therein, and bestows power on him and the
Court to proceed in the same course for the future. In
consequence, from that time down to the Revolution, this
sort of process was in ordinary practice. It is to be noted,
that while the Judges thus broke down the ancient custom
of the realm, by proceeding to trial in absence of the ac∣cused;
they rigidly adhered to the other side of that same
custom, in refusing to let any counsel appear, or any defence
be offered, on his behalf.</P>
<P>IT does not appear to have been so early settled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of Trial in Absence for Treason.</NOTE> that it
was warrantable straightway to proceed to execution, on the
apprehending of the traitor convicted in this extraordinary
course. On the 24th March 1679, William Veatch had come
to stand in this hazardous situation. The Court, unwilling
to decide in so new and so distressing a question, referred the
matter to the Privy Council for their direction and advice.
The King desires the Council to instruct the Court, to proceed
against the prisoner according to law. Whereupon the
Court again entreat, and earnestly request the advice of the
Privy Council, and of the Lords of Session; finding, they
say, no precedent for execution of these sentences in ab∣sence,
and esteeming this to be a point of equal importance
and delicacy, as that of the forfeiture in absence itself; and
seeing cause to follow in this instance, the laudable custom
of their predecessors, who in new and important cases, did
not proceed without the advice of their superiors, the Coun∣cil,
and of the Lords of Session. At length, on the 28th
July 1679, they are extricated from this dilemma by a
remission. Nevertheless, in the end, this step also was ta∣ken,
<PB N="457" REF="458"/>
and at a period too, when any such proceeding was less
to be looked for. On the 28th June 1699, Hugh Fraser and
John Fraser, two of the associates of Fraser of Beaffort, in
his high and monstrous crimes, and who along with him
had been forfeited in absence, on the 6th September 1688,
“being now apprehended and brought before the said Lords
to hear the time, place and manner of their execution ap∣pointed,”
they are, without farther form or proceedings,
ordered to be executed on the 4th of August 1699.</P>
<P>CONTRARY to what might have been expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of Trial in Absence for Treason.</NOTE> this ini∣quitous
mode of trial is none of the grievances which
were set forth in the Claim of Right in 1689. Perhaps it
had been thought desirable for the security of the new esta∣blishment,
to keep the terror of the law hanging over
its adversaries; in which there was thus far the appear∣ance
of justice, that their own invention was turned against
themselves. So it is, that the act 1690, c. 31. while it re∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>einded
all those sentences of forfeiture in absence which
passed before 1669, because there was till then no autho∣rity
in law for any such proceedings; and while it rescind∣ed
the act 1669 itself, as far as it ratified those particular
forfeitures; yet left the general enactment of that statute as
to the future standing and entire. There is accordingly a
noted instance of trial in absence, since 1690; that of Simon
Fraser of Beaufort (afterwards Lord Lovat) and his asso∣ciates,
convicted in September 1698, of a treasonable rising
and continuing in arms. But with this one exception, which
was owing probably to the public indignation at the mon∣strous
and abominable injuries to a private person, which ac∣companied
that case, no use was made by King William's
ministers of the high power which the law thus put into
<PB N="458" REF="459"/>
their hands. In particular, the Earls of Melfort, Midleton,
and Lauderdale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23. 1694</NOTE> along with ninety others, being summoned
on points of treason, and failing to appear, were none of
them put to any hardship beyond the course of common
law by fugitation. It was, however, only the statute of the
7th of Anne, which by communicating the English form of
process, and virtually repealing the act 1669, deprived the
prosecutor, if he should be so disposed, of all power of
insisting in such a process. The remedy, therefore, in our
days, against the danger from known traitors who have esca∣ped
to parts abroad, and who by their possessions and in∣fluence
in the country may be movers of further troubles,
and a means of maintaining disaffection to the Government,
lies only where it ought to be; in an application to the ju∣stice
and wisdom of the Legislature for an act of attainder.</P>
<P>ANOTHER course of process,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial for Trea∣son after Death.</NOTE> of the same stamp with the last,
but of an older date, and which served accordingly as an argu∣ment
for that innovation, was the trial and forfeiture of a
traitor deceased. This was attempted for the first time in 1540,
in the case of Robert Lesly; and mainly upon the authority of
the Civil Law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dig. ad L. Jul. Maj. L. ult.;—Mack. Obs. on statutes, p. 136, 137.; Crim. p. 29. No. 22▪</NOTE>, which, in the case at least of proper perduel∣lion,
or rising in arms, seems to have permitted this extraor∣dinary
sort of accusation. The novelty and injustice of such
a proceeding, excited, however, surprise and discontent in
the country. Therefore the King, “for stancing of sik mur∣mur,”
and meaning (as he tells us) “on nae sorte to move
or doe ony thing, bot that hee may justlie bee advised of
the three Estaites,” came to Parliament and desired their
<PB N="459" REF="460"/>
opinion “quhidder that he hes ane action to pursew sik sum∣mondes
or not.” In answer to which consultation the
whole Estates of Parliament “all in ane voyce, but variance
and discrepance,” assented to this new pretension; and de∣clared
his Majesty's right to insist in such actions “conform to
the commoun law, gude equity and reason, notwithstanding
there is nae special law, acte nor provision of the realme,
made thereupon of before.” Positive as this opinion was, it
did not however prove satisfactory to the people at large; and
it was thought proper thus far to comply with their desires,
that the prosecution should only lie within the space of five
years after the traitor's death, and for such treason as had
been notorious in his lifetime. This, which in the main was
agreeable to the Civil Law, was ordered by a statute of 1542,
which has never been printed. Yet on the 24th June 1609,
sentence of forfeiture passed in Parliament against Logan of
Restalrig, for accession to the Earl of Gowrie's conspiracy; of
which in his lifetime Logan had never been suspected<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See an account of this trial in Arnot's Criminal Cases, p. 46. <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE form of this extraordinary sort of process,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial for Trea∣son after Death.</NOTE> was by cita∣tion
of the traitor's heirs; not only as they might defend his
memory, but as they were themselves interested to save
their inheritance from consiscation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hence, in the process of forsaulture against the Duke of Monmouth, we find the Court demurring to proceed, and the diet from time to time continued, be∣cause the Duke's heirs were prisoners at the time, and not in a situation to de∣fend; until such time as a letter came from the Dutchess naming lawyers for her and her children; who judicially said that they had no defences to plead.

<PB N="460" REF="461"/>
render the iniquity of the thing more palpable, the shock∣ing
indecency was sometimes used, of raising the bones of
the deceased from the grave, and presenting them at the
bar. This was done, both in Robert Lesly's case, and in
that of Logan of R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stalrig. Notice may also be taken of
the proceedings in the case of Francis Moubray, in January
1603. This man being killed in his attempt to escape from
the Castle of Edinburgh; his dead body was brought to the
bar, and there had doom pronounced over it, to be hanged and
quartered, and the head and limbs to be stuck up on con∣spicuous
places of the city.</P>
<P>IT does not appear, that either trial in absence or trial after
death was ever attempted to be applied to the statutory trea∣sons
of murder under trust, theft in landed men, and the
like. Every proceeding of this kind is now excluded by the
communication of the English course of process; for which
reason nothing farther shall be added on the subject.</P>
<P>ANOTHER article of moment respecting trial for treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Evi∣dence in Cases of Treason.</NOTE> is
the nature of the evidence on which the prisoner may be con∣victed.
Touching this, Mackenzie has said<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Criminals, Tit. Treason, No. 21.</NOTE>, that not only per∣sons
who would be reckoned inadmissible as witnesses in other
cases, are freely admitted in treason, but that one witness is
sufficient to condemn; and for this he appeals to an act of
sederunt of the Lords of Session in 1591. As, however, no
such ordinance is to be found in the books of sederunt; so it
is to be hoped, that none to that effect was ever published.
But if in truth such was ever the practice of the Court; cer∣tainly
it was a departure from our ordinary cautious rule of
decision, in just the very case where it was most necessa∣ry
<PB N="461" REF="462"/>
to be observed. And this our neighbours of England so
well perceived, that notwithstanding their rule for ordinary
crimes, which condemns upon the testimony, if positive and
creditable, of a single witness, they, by repeated statutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1st Edward VI. c. 12.—5th and 6th Edward VI. c. 11.—1st and 2d Philip and Mary, c. 10.</NOTE>,
required two witnesses to convict of treason; except in
cases of coining and counterfeiting the seals. By the
last of these laws, which is statute 7. William III. c. 3.
it is farther explained and declared, that either there must
be two witnesses to the same overt act of treason; or if
they swear to different acts, these must be acts of the same
sort of treason, so as in some measure to cohere, and strength∣en
each other<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This seems to have been law even before the statute of William. Thus, in the trial of Ireland, Groves, and Pickering, (December 17. 1678,) for conspi∣ring to kill the King, the Chief-Justice laid it down: “For if killing the King be the fact in question, and one person proves they would do it by one thing, and another by another, and one in one place, and another in another; yet these are two witnesses to prove one fact, that is the substance, which is the killing of the King.” St. Trials, vol. ii. p. 714. In like manner, in the conference of the Judges preparatory to the trial of the regicides, it was resolved, “That there need not be two witnesses to prove every act tending to the com∣passing of the King's death. But one witness, to prove one overt act tending to the compassing of the King's death, and another witness to prove another act tending to the same end, are sufficient. For compassing the King's death is treason. And then, if two several witnesses prove two several acts tending to compassing the King's death, the treason is proved by two witnesses; as the law in case of treason requires.” St. Trials, vol. iii. p. 303.</P>
<P>The same opinion was given by all the Judges in the trial of Lord Stafford. St. Trials, vol. ii. p. 204, 205.</P></NOTE>. Thus, if one witness swear that a letter was
written to provide arms for attempting the King's life, and
another that the prisoner lay in wait to kill the King; both
these overt acts of compassing the King's death are sufficient∣ly
<PB N="462" REF="463"/>
proved. But if one swear that the prisoner lay in wait to kill
the King, and another, that he cruised at sea, under an enemy's
commission; these two acts are neither of them proved; be∣cause
the one is an act of compassing the King's death, the other
an act of adherence to his enemies<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 235, 236, 237.—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 428. No. 2.—See the case of Vaughan, St. Trials, vol. v. p. 38.</NOTE>.
It is, however, only
with respect to the overt acts charged in the indictment, that
the statute has laid down this rule.
In regard to other and
extrinsic circumstances, which are not evidence of any overt
act, nor so laid in the indictment, these are still open to be
proved by a single witness, according to the common law of
England.
For instance, that the prisoner is a native born
subject, and not an alien; this is a circumstance, which though
material to the treason, may be proved by one witness; be∣ing
neither itself an overt act, nor any wise subservient to the
proof of any that is charged<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 240.—Case of Vaughan, St. Trials, vol. v.</NOTE>.
As far, however, as relates
to the charge of the overt acts, the statute of William equally
regulates the evidence that is given upon the bill, towards the
indictment, as that which is given upon the trial itself<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 232, 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this rule respecting the evidence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof by Con∣fession.</NOTE> an exception is
made by the statutes of the 1st and 5th of Edward VI.
in case “the offender should willingly, and without vio∣lence,
confess the same.” These words had given rise
to a debate concerning the sort of confession that was meant;
whether it were only a confession upon arraignment, or if
a confession made to a Magistrate upon examination would
not equally satisfy the law; so that if this were proved by
<PB N="463" REF="464"/>
two witnesses, it might itself be ground of conviction, with∣out
farther proof of any overt act. But the act of William,
in repeating this provision, has farther described the con∣fession
as that which is made “in open court.” Under which
words, according to the opinion of Hawkins and Foster, no
confession shall be sufficient of itself to convict, unless it be
made upon arraignment; that is upon trial, and in presence
of the Court<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster's Crown Law, p. 240. to 244. Foster's Reports, p. 11. Case of Ber∣wick—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 429. No. 4.</NOTE> This will not however hinder a confession of another sort, before a Magistrate, or perhaps even to ordina∣ry
witnesses, to be given in evidence, in the same manner,
and to the same effect, as a declaration is admitted by the
Scottish practice, in other cases; that is to say, not as
being of itself a ground of conviction, but as a circum∣stance
of evidence, or a collateral fact, in corroboration of
the other testimony to the overt acts<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 241, 242.—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 249. No. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is farther to be observed upon this matter of confession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Confession by Use of Tor∣ture.</NOTE>
that under the law as it now stands, no use can be made of
violence or torture, to move the prisoner to an accusation
either of himself or others. The practice in Scotland, as
in most other countries of Europe, had been, to have re∣course
occasionally to that barbarous expedient; and rather
according to the supposed exigency of the case, than ac∣cording
to any settled rule, but more especially upon char∣ges
of treason<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>July 26. and August 7. 1684. William Spence servant of the Earl of Ar∣gyle was put to the torture, to cause him make discoveries against the Earl and others. See Fountainh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l.</P>
<P>John Spruel and Robert Ferguson had been tortured, and pleaded, that not ha∣ving confessed they were to be held as absolved, and could not be put to the knowledge of an assize. This defence was repelled (June 10. and 13 1681) on the ground that the questions put to them when under torture, relative to the charges in this libel, had been put to them irregularly, and without warrant from the commission of Privy Council.</P></NOTE>. And with respect to such cases, at least
<PB N="464" REF="465"/>
where the charge was confirmed by any presumptions against
the prisoner, (and Mackenzie says that one witness would in
this view be sufficient), even the Claim of Right seems indi∣rectly
to admit the lawfulness and propriety of the practice;
for it only says “that the using torture without <HI>evidence,</HI>
“and in <HI>ordinary</HI> crimes, is contrary to law.” But the act
of the 7th of Anne, c. 21. took the decisive step of at once
abolishing this vestige of barbarity, with respect to all
crimes, and in all cases whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE act of William has farther said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evidence must be of the overt Acts libelled.</NOTE>“that no evidence
shall be admitted or given of any overt act, which is not
expressly laid in the indictment.” The meaning of this
provision is no other, than to enforce in this instance that rule
of natural justice, (observed in all other cases without the aid
of any positive injunction, but necessary perhaps to be guarded
in the case of State prosecutions), which confines the proof
to the heads and charges set forth in the indictment; upon
which alone the prisoner comes prepared for his defence. One
who is indicted for compassing the King's death, in as much as
he lay in wait to kill the King, cannot therefore be convicted
on proof, (nor will any such proof be taken nor allowed), that
he gave money to another to make the attempt to kill the
King at a different time and place. For though both be overt
acts of treason, and of the same sort of treason; and though
both, if duly laid in the indictment, would be admitted to
<PB N="465" REF="466"/>
proof (since there is no limitation of the number of overt
acts that may be laid); yet they are distinct and indepen∣dent
charges, which may require quite different courses
of defence, on the part of the accused. It is this and
not any reason of form, that is the substantial ground
of the rule; which is therefore carried no greater length
than these considerations require. Whereby, if the circum∣stance
offered to be proved, though not laid in the in∣dictment,
be however nearly connected with the overt act
which is laid, and goes directly to establish it, this, without
a doubt, may be given in evidence: for it bears upon the
very charge to which the prisoner's attention has been called;
and no indictment can be expected to set forth (nor is there
any law nor practice for it in other cases), the whole detail
of circumstances and presumptions, from which the truth
of the libelled charge may appear or be made out<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the case of Francis Francia, January 22. 1716, one of the overt acts laid was his writing several letters to persons in France, declaring his purpose of en∣gaging in a rebellion, and soliciting assistance towards it. In evidence of this, it was offered to produce the answers to these letters, received by him from his French correspondents. It was objected, that every one of these answers, was it∣self also an overt act, and that the words of them not being set forth in the in∣dictment, they could not be given in evidence. But this objection was over∣ruled, and the letters admitted. The Chief Baron said, “None can say that here is not an overt act expressly laid. It is expressly laid, and sufficiently de∣scribed: Sure it is not necessary to mention all the evidence that is to prove the overt act: The intent of the law is no more than that the overt act should be sufficiently described and charged in the indictment.” “If it be laid that a man did consult and agree to levy war, a time and a place must be laid; but all the times and places when and where he met and consulted, and all the persons names with whom he met and consulted, need not be mentioned in the indictment; neither need the words of the consultation be set forth.” State Trials, vol. vi. p. 73. <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE> Thus
in the trial of Ambrose Rockwood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21. 1696.</NOTE> these were two of the
<PB N="466" REF="467"/>
overt acts laid in the indictment; that he and others had
consulted on the means of way-laying the King, and that
they agreed to provide forty men for that purpose. In evi∣dence
of these it was offered, and after consultation was al∣lowed
to be proved, that Rockwood showed to one of the
conspirators, a list of a certain number who were to join in
the attempt, at the head of which list stood his own name as
their leader. It was plain that this circumstance went di∣rectly
to prove the overt acts which were laid, viz. the de∣liberation
to way-lay the King, and to provide a party for that
end<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Foster, p. 245, 246.—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 436. No. 34. St. Tr. vol. iv.</NOTE>. The benefit therefore of the statute lies in this, that
contrary to the older practice in cases of treason, an overt
act not laid in the indictment, and which has no relation to
the overt act that is laid, cannot be given in evidence; where∣as
by the older practice it might have been given, if both
overt acts were of the same sort of treason. Farther; though
the circumstances relative to the overt act libelled be of
that nature, that they might themselves have been laid as
overt acts in the indictment; yet, if being admitted to proof,
they do not fully establish the very overt act that is libelled,
certainly no regard can be paid to them, and the prisoner
must be acquitted.</P>
<P>IN the article next to be taken notice of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Service of In∣dictment for Treason.</NOTE> the practice of
England has been reformed by positive statutes, after the re∣semblance
of the <HI>common law</HI> of Scotland; and at the same
time, the exception of cases of treason from our ordina∣ry
rule, has very properly been taken away. It is the
general direction of the Scottish practice for citation of
the accused, whether a prisoner or at large, that he be
<PB N="467" REF="468"/>
called on 15 days <HI>induciae;</HI> and be served at the same time
with a copy of the libel, and of the lists of jurymen and
witnesses who are to pass upon his trial. But it appears from
the trial (among many that might be mentioned) of Fran∣cis
Tenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 8. 1600. Dec. 3. 1684.</NOTE> and of Baillie of
Jerviswood, that in the case
of crimes against the State, so far was this equitable custom
from being uniformly observed, that the pannel was some∣times
brought to the bar, upon no longer notice than 24
hours; and especially this was allowed, if, as in Jervis∣wood's
case<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>“Repel the defence, in respect the pannel is a prisoner, and that it has been the constant custom of the Court, and that the pannel made no former appli∣cation for an exculpation.” State Trials, vol. iv. p. 1096, 1097.</P>
<P>The same objection had been made and overruled in the case of James Finlay, and thirty-two persons more, (November 10. 1679), who had only been allowed about sixteen hours after service of their libels.</P>
<P>In the case also of Patrick Earl of Orkney, (February 1. 1615), where the libel was long, and bore a variety of charges, it appears that no copy of it was ever given him.

1685, c. 3. (suggested probably by the complaints that
were made of the proceedings in that very trial), which,
while it ratified what had been done in former cases, extend∣ed
however the <HI>inducia</HI> to 48 hours, as well as authorised
a farther delay, if the prisoner applied for exculpation.
Now, so different are the views which have been taken of this
matter in the neighbouring kingdom, that whereas, by the
course of their practice in ordinary cases, the prisoner has no
right to see his indictment, and much less the list of witnesses or
jurors, before his trial; yet as to the case of treason, it is pro∣vided
<PB N="468" REF="469"/>
by statute 7. William III. c. 3.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">It was not law before, in cases of treason more than in others. See the trial of Lord Preston, where the opinion of the Court was given, that the prisoner could not have a copy of the indictment. See State Trials, vol. iv. p. 415, 416, 417, 418.</NOTE> that five days at least
before he is tried, he shall be served with a true copy of the
whole indictment; and two days at least before he is tried,
he shall have a true copy of the pannel <HI>of jurors,</HI> who are
summoned to his trial. Farther, by statute 7. Anne, c. 21.
after a certain period therein mentioned, and long ago ex∣pired,
the <HI>induciae</HI> for service of the copy of indictment are
enlarged to <HI>ten</HI> days; and the prisoner is at the same time to
be served with a copy of the list of witnesses as well as jurors,
with their professions and places of abode. Sir Michael
Foster<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Crown Law, p. 250, 251.</NOTE> has expressed himself as doubtful with respect to the
propriety of these provisions; and in particular, he takes no∣tice
of the inconvenience which might attend them in the
trial of offences against the coin or royal seals. But this ob∣jection
has since been obviated by the statute 6. Geo. III.
c. 53. which repeals the act of Anne, as far as it relates to
that class of treasons.</P>
<P>IN the following articles also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prisoner's Wit∣nesses, to be ci∣ted and sworn.</NOTE> the practice of Scotland
has long been familiar with those equitable rules, which
have only found admission into the English process of trea∣son
in virtue of modern statutes, and in derogation of
their common law. By statute 7. William III. c. 3. the
prisoner is to have the aid of the like process of Court, as
the prosecutor, for compelling his witnesses to appear. By
the same statute, and by 1. Anne, (stat. 2.) c. 9. such wit∣nesses
are also to be examined upon oath; whereby they
<PB N="469" REF="470"/>
may receive the same degree of credit as the witnesses for
the Crown. And again, by the said act of William, the pri∣soner,
on his desire, shall have counsel assigned him by the
Court, to examine the witnesses, and take charge of his de∣fence:
a benefit which the common law of England does
not allow to any person, in his trial for a capital crime,
unless to plead some point of law, which the Court desire to
have considered.</P>
<P>To conclude;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitation of Process. Per∣emptory chal∣lenge.</NOTE> this change of our system of treason law has
been attended with two alterations more, which are both in fa∣vour
of the accused. Unless in the case of attempt upon the
King's life by assassination or otherwise, the indictment for
treason must be found by the grand jury, within three
years after the offence. This was provided by the said act
of William. Moreover, the prisoner now enjoys, as by the
common law of England, that which no person has right to
upon his trial in Scotland for any other crime, the benefit
of a peremptory challenge to the jurors, to the number of
thirty-five.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 347.—Hawkins, vol. ii. p. 414. No. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XIII. WE have now reached the last article in the doc∣trine
of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judgment for Treason.</NOTE> the judgment that attends it on conviction;
which is, as to the person of the offender, judgment of death,
accompanied with such circumstances of rigor in the way
of execution, and of indignity to the dead body, as may be
supposed to affect the spectators with terror, or to mark the
public contempt and detestation of the traitor. He is to
be drawn to the gallows on a sledge or hurdle<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This was part of the sentence by the law of Scotland. See the sentence upon John Master of Forbes, July 14. 1537.</NOTE>; he is to be
<PB N="470" REF="471"/>
hanged by the neck, and then cut down alive; his entrails
are to be taken out, and burned while he is yet alive; his
head is to be cut off and his body divided into four
quarters; and the head and quarters are to be at the King's
disposal. In the case of a woman offender, in order to
avoid these shocking indecencies, (which however have
been generally dispensed with by the royal mercy even in the
case of men), the sentence is, that she be drawn to the gal∣lows,
and burned alive<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This was the doom in the case of Janet Douglas, Lady Glamyss, July 17. 1537.</NOTE>. Treasonable offenders against the
coin, as being rather traitors by the construction of the law,
than in the substance of their offence, are more mildly dealt
with if they are males; being drawn to the gallows, and
hanged till they be dead. But, by a strange distinction, a
woman coiner has judgment to be burned alive.</P>
<P>IN regard to the estate of the traitor, the consequences are
<HI>first,</HI> the confiscation of all his moveables as in other cases of
felony; and <HI>secondly,</HI> the forfeiture of all honours and real
estate to the Crown, for him and his heirs for ever: a con∣sequence,
which, as far as relates to Scotland, is peculiar to
the crime of treason, but is an ancient part of our common
law respecting that crime; and seems to have held at a very
ancient period, when the escheat, in all other instances of
delict, was not to the Crown, but to the superior of the
lands<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the case of treason, committed by adherence to the Pretender, or corre∣spondence with him, the Sovereign, by statute 1st, George 1. c. 20. commonly called the <HI>Clan Act,</HI> departed from the emoluments of forfeiture with respect to lands held of subjects superior, in the view of rewarding such superiors or others, as should continue faithful in their duty. 1. If a vassal holding of a subject were at∣tainted of treason, his lands were to recognosce to the superior, continuing in his duty, and to remain with him for ever, in the same manner as is resigned, <HI>ad∣perpetuam remanentiam.</HI> 2. In case of the attainder of a tacksman, his right was to fall, and the tenement, together with the single and liferent escheat of such tenant, to be enjoyed by the landlord, the author of his right, continuing in his allegiance. 3. In case of the attainder of any immediate vassal of the Crown, his sub-vassal, continuing in his duty, was thenceforth to hold his tenement im∣mediately under the King. 4. Any tenant under such offender, and continuing in his duty, was to hold his lands free of rent, for two years after the attainder. But by statute 21st, George II. c. 34. the 1st, 2d, and 4th of these provisions. were repealed, from and after the 29th September 1748; and even as to the <HI>third,</HI> it may seem liable to doubt, whether the benefit of it did not cease with the life of the then Pretender; notwithstanding the act of the 17th, George II. c. 39. which introduces a new treason by correspondence with the Pretender's sons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="472"/>
THIS absolute and perpetual forfeiture is, however, by the
law as it now stands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture of entailed Estates.</NOTE> only in the case of an estate in see∣simple,
where the one and entire interest in the estate is
vested in the traitor;. According to the native principles
of the law of Scotland, there was no room for any more
favourable construction of the forfeiture even in the case of
a tailzied fee, or entailed estate. For in the estimation of
our practice, every substitute in the tailzie, when he suc∣ceeds,
is no other than an <HI>heir;</HI> who takes by <HI>inheritance,</HI>
of and through those who are called before him, and by
the proper forms of title as in a <HI>succession,</HI> the very same estate
of see, which has been vested in those prior and more savour∣ed
persons. As also, it is not conceived with us. that before
succeeding, the heir of tailzie has in him any actual or real
estate of his own, distinct from that of the present owner; but
only a prospect of succeeding guarded by extraordinary pro∣visions,
and which the law accommodates him with peculiar
expedients to enforce and maintain. In conformity to this
principle, the act 1685, c. 22. which first regulated the mat∣ter
of tailzies, was guarded with an express provision saving
his Majesty's interest “in all confiscations or other fines, as
<PB N="472" REF="473"/>
“the punishment of crimes.” At the Revolution however
among other popular laws then passed, with the view of con∣ciliating
the people to the new establishment, was the act
1690. c. 33.; which declared in substance, that no heir of
entail should be prejudged by the forfeiture of his prede∣cessor,
except in as far as the traitor had power to contract
debt or affect the lands, by the quality of his right; if the
tailzie were duly completed by insertion in the record. This
then was the state of things at the Union; when by the act
of Anne, (and it is said after a severe struggle in the House
of Lords<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 376, 377.</NOTE>), persons convicted of treason in this country
were made liable to the same corruption of blood, pains,
penalties and forfeitures, as persons convicted of that crime
in England.</P>
<P>Now in England, all estates of inheritance had been made
liable to forfeiture, by statute 26. Henry VIII. c. 13. in
virtue of which, the traitor forfeits for himself and his
heirs. But, on the other side, according to the notion of
an English entail, with <HI>remainders over</HI> as they are termed,
which in point of <HI>legal description,</HI> are the nearest thing to
our <HI>conditional institutions,</HI> the estate or fee is held to be
broken into parts; whereof that which belongs to the re∣mainder-man,
(or substitute heir as we should call him),
is distinct from the interest of the present tenant in tail,
or possessor of the estate, and his heirs, and appertains
to him in his own proper and original, though even∣tual
right; and cannot therefore be forfeited nor lost to
him by the treason or delict of any other person. In pursu∣ance,
therefore, of the object of the statute of Anne, which
was to bring the forfeitures and punishments of treason as
near as may be to an agreement throughout the united king∣doms;
<PB N="473" REF="474"/>
the substitute heir has been held to be a remain∣der-man,
and this analogy has been assumed as the ground
of decision with respect to the extent of the forfeiture of
a Scots entailed estate. The judgment of the House of Lords
upon that matter in the case of Gordon of Park was, that
the estate forfeited for the life of Sir William Gordon, the
traitor and present tenant, and during the life of his issue∣male.
called as such to the succession by the tailzie; and that
on extinction of these, it would revert from the Crown to the
next substitute (or remainder-man) Captain John Gordon, as
called by the tailzie, failing Sir William's issue-male, under
the description of heir-male of the body of Sir James Gordon
the entailer<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Falconer's Decisions, November 16. 1750, Captain Gordon <HI>contra</HI> King's Advocate. Kames's Elacidations, art. 42.</NOTE>. That is to say, the interest of this next order or
class of substitutes was to be viewed as a new acquisition, or
separate estate from that of the offender and his issue male.
Even this limitation of the forfeiture will, however, only
hold in the case of such tailzies as are duly completed by
entry on record, in terms of the statute 1685. For that
circumstance is a necessary qualification to the benefit of
the statute, and for taking the estate out of the case of a
fee simple; which, as the possessor may effectually alienate
or incumber by his deed, so must it absolutely and entirely
forfeit by his crime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falconer, vol. ii. No. 178.</NOTE> Judgment was given to that effect, in
the Court of Session, on the claim of James Kinloch, January
10. 1751.</P>
<P>As entailed estates are thus far subject to forfeiture by the
public law of the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture of entailed Estates. Kilk. No. 8. v. Tailzie.</NOTE> any attempt on the part of the entailer
to disappoint or elude the law by the provisions of his deed, is
<PB N="474" REF="475"/>
of course nugatory, and ineffectual<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Kilkerran, No. 8. <HI>voce</HI> Tailzie.</NOTE>. Likewise, it is obvious,
that though the traitor have contravened the tailzie before
committing the treason, this is no hinderance of the forfeiture,
if the irritancy has not also before that time been declared.
For until declarator, the contravener's infeftment is not re∣solved
by his fault; and all his deeds, as far as consistent with
the tailzie, done after the irritancy, and before the decree
declaring it, shall stand and have effect; whereas by the trea∣son
the right of the Crown instantly vests, and attaches on
the subject. This was the decision, both of the Court of Session
and in the House of Lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falconer, vol. ii. No. 165. 178.</NOTE> in the case of Gordon of Park,
November 16. 1750; and on the claim of David Kinloch,
January 10. 1751. On the same principle went the judg∣ment
in the nearly parallel case of Lundin against the
King's Advocate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 171.</NOTE> December 13. 1750; where the forfeited
estate of James Drummond, a Papist, was claimed by James
Lundin, in virtue of his right under the statute 1700, c. 3.
as the nearest Protestant heir. It was esteemed a good an∣swer
to this claim, that the Protestant heir is not immediate∣ly
and <HI>vi juris</HI> invested with the estate; but has only a power
bestowed on him, which he must exert and follow forth by
a certain mode of proof, to divest the Popish heir, who is in
the apparent title; and which right if he do not use, but
suffer the Popish heir to possess and enjoy until attainder, he
is then too late with his claim.</P>
<P>BY the Scottish practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture of an apparent Heir.</NOTE> the proper law of forfeiture, (ab∣stracting
from those consequences, which may perhaps at∣tend
the corruption of blood, and of which afterwards),
attaches not only on such tenements wherein the offender
<PB N="475" REF="476"/>
is duly vested in form of law; but on those also whereof <HI>at the
time of the forfeiture</HI> he is in the apparent title as heir, by the
death of his predecessor; for the substantial right to these is
in him<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stair, p. 441, 442. No. 36, 38.—Dirleton's Doubts, p. 72. 76.</NOTE>. And I have not observed that there is any thing
contrary to this in the law of England. Whether the same
should hold in the case of an estate falling to a person after
forfeiture, (as for instance if the convict escapes from gaol
and outlives his ancestor); or whether in such a case the
estate would devolve to the next in succession after him, (he
by reason of his forfeiture being disregarded and accounted
as none); this was a point of the Scottish practice, which
Dirleton thought doubtful, but which Stair<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">There is no doubt if the person forfeited should be <HI>fugitive,</HI> and <HI>survive</HI> his predecessor, but the heritage <HI>accrescing</HI> to him, wherein <HI>de presenti</HI> he might be infest, would fall under forfeiture though he were not actually infest.” Stair, b. 3. tit. 3. No. 38.—See Dirleton's Doubts, <HI>voce</HI> Forfeiture, p. 72.</NOTE> resolved in fa∣voured
of the Crown. And indeed this opinion seems to be fa∣voured
by the words of the statute 1584, c. 2. The remark
made by Bankton upon this situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. ii. p. 263. No. 35.</NOTE> seems, however, to be
just; that though the attainder give rise to this emolument,
yet truly the tenement does not accrue to the Crown <HI>by for∣feiture,</HI>
or as part of the estate of the traitor, who never
had any right therein; but by the escheat of <HI>ultimus baeres</HI> or
as <HI>bona vacantia,</HI> which the King claims, because during the
life of the traitor, who is the nearest heir, no other person
can have them. But it appears that in this situation, the
escheat by the law of England is not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blakstone, b. 2. c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. v. ii. p. 253.</NOTE> as it was with us, to the
King, but to the lord of the fee. Hence arises a que∣stion,
<PB N="476" REF="477"/>
whether in this article we are to be ruled by the law
of England, or by our ancient custom.</P>
<P>THE reason of doubt seems to lie in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If regulated by the Scots or En∣glish Law.</NOTE>—that the only
thing meant to be regulated and brought to an uniformity
by the act of Anne, is the punishment of the traitor and his
race; and that these persons equally suffer the forfeiture of
their property, whether the tenement forfeit to the King, or
escheat to the superior. But it may be answered, that from
this there would in the end result a difference of the
condition of the forfeiture sustained by the traitor in the
two parts of the realm. For if the tenement goes to the
Crown; then can the King, whose interest is alone concern∣ed
in that case, restore the estate to the traitor, and rein∣state
him in his possessions: whereas over the interest of the
superior, if it escheats to him, the King, by the law of
England, has confessedly no such power. It is to be obser∣ved
too, that in other matters, as for instance with respect
to the interest of creditors, the act of Anne has already
been construed to intend a more extensive alteration of the
law, such as applies the English system, as far as may be, to
all the relative and subordinate portions of doctrine.</P>
<P>BY the law of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeiture at∣taches at the Date of the Treason.</NOTE> the forfeiture relates backwards
to the time of the treason, so as to annul all interme∣diate
sales and incumbrances, but not those before the
fact. This rule, which in the main is agreeable to that laid
down in the Scots act 1690, c. 33. it has however, on occa∣sion
of the two last rebellions, been found necessary to break
in upon, by special statutes<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1st George I. c. 20.; 20th George II. c. 41.</NOTE>; which, the better to avoid
<PB N="477" REF="478"/>
all settlements <HI>intra familiam,</HI> and all simulate or trust con∣veyances,
made by persons who had it in contemplation to
rebel, invalidated all deeds made after certain days (Au∣gust
1. 1714, June 24. 1742) prior to the time of open re∣bellion;
except as far as they were made for real and one∣rous
causes, vouched otherwise than by the deeds of convey∣ance
themselves.</P>
<P>IN regard to the interest of third parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenants, Credi∣tors, &amp;c. if hurt by the Forfei∣ture.</NOTE> depending on
that of the traitor, such as tenants, vassals, spouses, and credi∣tors;
this was secured in the main (for it had formerly
been otherwise, and this was among the grievances set forth
at the Revolution) by the statute 1690, c. 33. which
preserved to all creditors, whether personal or real, their
claims upon the property; to all tacksmen their rights, if
clad with possession; to all vassals their subaltern titles, in
like manner as if confirmed by the Crown; and to husband
and wife, their rights of terce and courtesy, as well as those
arising from the provisions of contract of marriage. As far
as relates to the husband's courtesy, or the wife's conven∣tional
jointure, but not her dower or legal provision out of
the husband's inheritance, the law of England seems to be
the same<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. c. 29. p. 375. St. 5, &amp; 6. Edw. VI. c. II.</NOTE>. In regard also to incumbrances, and in gene∣ral,
any sort of lien or real interest in the forfeited tene∣ments;
these too seem to be maintained by a saving clause
in the statutes 26. Henry VIII. c. 13.; 33. Henry VIII.
c. 20. But for pure personal creditors, there does not
seem to be the like security, either by any general statute,
or at common law. Therefore, on occasion of the rebel∣lions
in 1715 and 1745, special provision was made in that
<PB N="478" REF="479"/>
behalf, by the statutes which prescribed the management of
the forfeited estates.</P>
<P>THE interest which thus arises to the Crown upon attain∣der
of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Estate vests by the Attainder.</NOTE> is held to vest straightway, in virtue of the
attainder itself, without aid of any process, decree, or vest∣ing
act; so that the King is held and adjudged to be thence∣forward
in possession, and his managers in these matters, the
Barons of Exchequer, may issue their precepts to the proper
officers, to survey and enter on the premises. But it is on∣ly
to attainder, that is, judgment received, or to outlawry,
which by the law of England in this instance amounts to at∣tainder,
that any such consequence is attached: for if the
traitor be killed in battle, or be executed by martial law, or
die before judgment, though after conviction, no manner
of forfeiture ensues<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 374, 380.</NOTE> It is also to be observed of some of
the modern treasons with relation to the coin, that the for∣feiture
is avoided by express provision of the statutes which
create them.</P>
<P>A THIRD and very severe consequence of attainder of trea∣son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of Treason works Corruption of Blood.</NOTE>
and which in our system is peculiar to that one case,
and even in that one seems only to be introduced by the act
7. Anne<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>Craig has no doubt informed us, (Lib. 2. Dieg. 18. No. 23.), that in one instance, grandchildren were excluded from the succession of their grandfather, by reason of the treason of their father, who had been killed in open rebellion. But Craig himself allows that this matter was the subject of much difference of opi∣nion;
and he is the single authority for any such doctrine.</P>
<P>No mention is made of it by Mackenzie. It is stated by Dirleton, (<HI>voce</HI> Forfeiture, p. 72, 73.), as a subject of doubt with respect even to the issue of the traitor. Lord Stair, (b. 3. tit. 3. No. 37, 38.) after taking notice of the practice of England, says, that it is not consonant to our custom, that forefeiture should infer corruption of blood, unless where the sentence specially inflicts it; and gives his opinion, (not having sound any practice to the contrary, and seeing no reason for it), that even the descendents of the traitor may succeed to their grandfather, or other predeces∣sor through him. These authorities, joined to the instances of <HI>special</HI> sentence of dishabilitation, which seems to be an expedient that is resorted to in default of the other, may be thought sufficient to show, that there was at least no regular nor thorough establishment of the corruption of blood, by the law of Scotland.</P></NOTE>, c. 21. but in England, is the ordinary consequence
<PB N="479" REF="480"/>
of conviction of any felony, is what they term the corrup∣tion
of the traitor's blood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vol. ii. p. 254, 255.</NOTE> Whereby, as Blackstone ex∣presses
it, “the channel which conveyed the hereditary blood
from his ancestors to him, is not only exhausted for the pre∣sent,
but is totally dammed up, and rendered impervious
for the future.” He cannot, therefore, after attainder, (sup∣posing
him to escape execution), succeed as heir to any one;
nor can his posterity, nor any other person inherit any thing
<HI>of</HI> him, nor even of any other person <HI>through</HI> him, if the
descent must be connected in that way, and with mention of
him as a link in the chain of conveyance. Thus, if John,
the eldest son of James, is convicted of treason in his fa∣ther's
lifetime, and is executed, and leaves a son, George;
this person, though he may take by direct settlement made by
his grandfather in his favour, (because no crime committed by
John can lessen the powers of James over his own property);
yet he cannot inherit of his grandfather, in course of law.
For in serving heir, he must connect his propinquity through
his father John, whose blood has lost the power of forming
a relation, as to this matter of inheritance. Nor is this to
be understood as true of the traitor's lineal descendents
only; but equally of all, who either upwards or collaterally,
<PB N="480" REF="481"/>
have occasion to trace their connection through his per∣son.
Thus, if there be two brothers, and one of them be at∣tainted
of treason, and the son of this person afterwards
purchase lands, and die without issue; his uncle cannot
inherit these lands: because they are related through the
attainted person<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 2. c. 49. No. 49.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falconer, vol. ii. No. 171.</NOTE> This principle was applied with us in
the case of the King <HI>contra</HI> Lundin, December 13. 1750.
On the other side, where the attainted person is not necessary
to be mentioned in tracing the descent from the deceased
to the heir claiming; there the corruption of blood is no
obstacle to the inheritance. Thus, if the son of one who
was attainted shall purchase land, and have a son, and die;
this son shall inherit of him; because he derives his descent
immediately from him. Or if a man have two sons, and
then be attainted, and one of the sons purchase lands, and
die without issue; the other shall be his heir; because he
may make up his title without mentioning the father<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 2. c. 49. No. 49.</NOTE> Nay,
if a person have two sons, of whom the eldest is attainted
and executed in his father's lifetime, and leaves no issue;
the second son shall nevertheless inherit of the father: be∣cause
he is the eldest son of his father in life at the time
when the succession opens; and his relation to his father is
nowise through his deceased brother, (who need not<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Craig, Lib. 2. Dieg. 18. No. 23.—Blackst. b. 2. c. 15.—Hawkins, b. 2. c. 49. No. 50.</NOTE> be
mentioned in his retour of service), but to his father direct∣ly.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="482"/>
ANOTHER thing to be observed of the corruption of blood,
and which serves not a little to increase the hardship of that
penalty is, that even a royal pardon will not cure it.
The bodily pains his Majesty may remit, and restore the
offender against the <HI>forfeiture,</HI> wherein only the royal in∣terest
is concerned; but over the corruption of blood he
has no power, by reason of the interest which thence arises
to a third person, the lord of the fee. If therefore a man
have a son, and be attainted, and afterwards pardoned, this
son shall nevertheless not inherit of him, nor of any person
through him; but shall give way to the lord of the fee, in a
question with whom, his blood, being once corrupted, conti∣nues
to be so for ever. But if that son had died, and another
been begotten after the pardon, this other would have suc∣ceeded;
because by the pardon the father is as it were a new
creature, and regains the capacity of conveying inheritable
blood to his issue. The only way, therefore, of completely
salving an attainder, is by an act of the Legislature<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Blackst. b. 2. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONLY two things more shall be observed. 1. With re∣spect
to those treasons which relate to the Papal supre∣macy,
or the counterfeiting the coin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the kingdom;
this consequence of attainder is saved by the statutes which
create them. 2. By the statute 7. Anne, c. 21. neither
the corruption of blood, nor even the total forfeiture of
lands, is a perpetual consequence of attainder, but for the
period only of the then Pretender's life; which has since,
by statute 17. Geo. II. c. 39. been extended to the lifetime
also of the Pretender's sons. After the death of those per∣sons,
no attainder for treason shall be to the disinheriting of
any heir, nor to the prejudice of any right or title, other
than that of the offender himself during his natural life.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="483"/>
THE law of Scotland is altered by the ad of Anne, not Only
as to treason but misprision of treason;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Misprision of Treason.</NOTE> which is committed by
being in the knowledge of a treason, and failing to reveal the
same, as soon as conveniently may be, to some Judge of assize,
or Justice of the Peace. It is thus not a substantive crime of
itself, but relative to that which is or shall be made treason;
so that whensoever any new treason is enacted, there results,
as a sort of necessary consequence from it, a new misprision
of treason, without any special words enacting it to be so<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Hale, vol. i. p. 373, 374.</NOTE>.
At common law, and until the statute 1. and 2. Philip and
Mary, c. 10. such concealment was more rigorously con∣strued,
and involved the person as a principal offender in
treason<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This seems also to have been the law of Scotland. George Sprott had sen∣tence as a traitor, August 12. 1608, for his treasonable fore-knowledge and con∣cealment of Gowrie's conspiracy. Also, in the case of Archibald Douglas, par∣son of Glasgow, indicted, May 16. 1586, for the murder of King Henry, (Darn∣ley), this of sore-knowledge and concealment of the conspiracy was stated as a se∣parate treason, and equal to the murder. The relevancy of this charge was not disputed; and the pannel protected himself by producing a remission of that part of the crime Again, on the 13th July 1537, the Master of Glamis, was convic∣ted of treason for concealing, and not revealing his mother's conspiracy to destroy the King by poison.</P>
<P>There is a noted controversy respecting the Roman law on this head, between the commentators Bartolus and Baldus. It turns on the meaning of the word <HI>consciis,</HI> in Law 5. No. 6. of the Code <HI>ad Leg. Juliam Maj.</HI> Bartolus, who in this is followed by Voet, maintains, that it is to be understood of mere know∣ledge and concealment of the treason, without farther participation. Baldus, and along with him Mathaeus, are of opinion that it only relates to <HI>accessories</HI> in the ordinary sense of the word. The debate is truly of little moment, as only rela∣tive to a constitution of the Emperor Arcadius, at that time under the tyranny of the Eunuch Eutropius, for whose safety this law was meant. This is hardly to be reckoned the Roman law. Baldus says, that Bartolus is now roasting in hell for his opinion.</P></NOTE> And it is still to be understood that this construc∣tion
<PB N="483" REF="484"/>
shall hold, if the concealment be accompanied with
any probable circumstance of assent; as by receiving and
comforting a traitor, or by presence at a treasonable con∣sultation
to kill the King or the like, if the person be in
the previous knowledge of the purpose of the meeting<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 120—Hawkins, b. 1. c. 20. No. 3, 4.</NOTE>.
There is also an instituted and positive misprision of
treason, by statute 13. Elizabeth, c. 2.; which enacts,
that those who forge foreign coin, not current in the king∣dom,
shall be held and punished as offenders of that degree.
The judgment for misprision of treason is perpetual impri∣sonment,
forfeiture of goods, and of the profits of land for
the offender's life. With respect to the necessity of two
witnesses in proof of the overt acts, the allowance of copies
of the indictment and of the lists of jurors and witnesses,
the benefit of counsel, and the limitation of time for the
prosecution; this offence seems by the several statutes rela∣tive
to these points, to be placed upon the same footing of
privilege as the principal treason.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF SEDITION.</HEAD>
<P>AS a proper sequel to the crime of treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP XXVII.</NOTE> something
shall now be said concerning that of Sedition; which
is so often the parent and forerunner of the other, by stir∣ring
those foul and mutinous humours in the multitude, which,
when once set afloat, may naturally issue in open violence
and insurrection.</P>
<P>I HAD formerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Crime.</NOTE> in drawing the line between sedition and
leasing-making, a proper occasion to explain the general no∣tion
of this offence. And I shall not now attempt any far∣ther
to describe it, (being of so various and comprehensive
a nature), than by saying, that it reaches all those practices,
whether by deed, word, or writing, or of whatsoever kind,
which are suited and intended to disturb the tranquillity of
the State;—for the purpose of producing public trouble or
commotion, and moving his Majesty's subjects to the dislike,
resistance, or subversion, of the established Government and
laws, or settled frame and order of things.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="486"/>
UNDER this description would fall a work, (such as it has
been reserved for the wickedness of the present age to pro∣duce),<NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices which amount to Se∣dition.</NOTE>
which should teach that all monarchy and hereditary
rank, or all clerical dignities and establishments of religion,
are an abuse and usurpation, contrary to reason and justice,
and unfit to be any longer suffered or continued. Or, though
the piece should not set out upon so broad a principle as this;
if it argue, (in common with the many compositions which
have lately been pressed upon the world), that the power of
the King is overgrown, and ought <HI>at any hazard</HI> to be re∣trenched;
or that the Commons are a mere nominal and pre∣tended
representative of the people, whose laws are entitled
to no manner of regard; or that the whole State is full of
corruption, and that the people ought to take the office of
reforming it upon themselves. All exhortations of this kind,
whether any commotion follow on them or not, (for if any
do follow, then it will depend on the degree, fashion, and
immediate occasion of that disturbance, whether it is not
treason in those who partake of it), are undoubted acts of
sedition; being calculated and employed for the direct pur∣pose
of loosening the hold which the Government has of the
opinions and affections of the people, and thus preparing
them for acts of resistance or aggression.</P>
<P>THE same judgment must be given with respect to him
who in a pamphlet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices which amount to Se∣dition.</NOTE> sermon, or other public and advised dis∣course,
shall exhort dissenters to refuse payment of taxes
till repeal of the Test Act; or shall question the lawfulness
of septennial Parliaments, and advise the people to meet at
the end of three years, and choose another Parliament for
themselves; or who shall devise a new form of league, asso∣ciation,
or convention for the people, whereby to constrain
<PB N="486" REF="487"/>
and overawe the Legislature into compliance with their de∣sires,
upon any point which is popular at the time.</P>
<P>THERE seems to be as little doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices which amount to Se∣dition.</NOTE> that any person would
incur the pains of sedition, (if the statute 6. Anne, c. 7.
had not made it treason), who, by writing or printing,
should deny the right of King and Parliament to make
laws for binding, the succession to the Crown. And the same
would be true, if, in the like advised form, any one should
inveigh against the statutes respecting the patronage of
church-livings, as beyond the powers of Parliament, and
contrary to the inherent rights of the people; and should
suggest a plan to them for taking the election of the clergy
into their own hands, with out regard to those enactments.</P>
<P>THE reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Sedition is a Point of Dittay.</NOTE> in all these cases, is the same; that measures
of this description, by exasperating the multitude, and in∣fecting
them with jealousy, and dislike of the established or∣der
of the State, tend directly to a breach between Sovereign
and subject, and to fill the realm with trouble and dissension.
Which miserable calamity to prepare, can no more be doubted
to be a cognisable crime, and one too of a high degree, than
that it is a crime to partake of the very measures themselves
of resitstance and violence (if such follow), to which these
exhortations have seduced. For it would be against all rea∣son
and policy to believe, that the Government of any coun∣try
must knowingly suffer the wicked project of its own sub∣version,
to be contrived, improved, and matured; and can
only then interpose when the conflagration has spread, and
the destruction of the fabric can no longer be prevented.
Such a position amounts indeed to nothing less than this,
(surely too absurd to need a refutation), that there may be a
<PB N="487" REF="488"/>
Sovereign without subjects, a law without an obligation,
and a Government without allegiance.</P>
<P>THIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition is a Crime at Com∣mon Law.</NOTE> therefore, of sedition is a crime, whereof the no∣tion
is coeval in all countries with the institution of regular
government; and arises directly out of the situation itself,
by the force of reason and necessity, without the aid of any
positive act or promulgation of the Legislature, pointing out
such practices as the subject of prosecution. So that even
if our statute-book were silent on the subject, and no instance
had occurred in past times of punishment inflicted on trans∣gressors
in this kind; yet still our Judges would be warrant∣ed
in applying a suitable correction to so pernicious a crime,
which cannot be left unpunished, without betraying the
people to misery, and the law and Government to destruc∣tion.
We have already, more than once, in the course of
our inquiries, had occasion to take notice of the applica∣tion
of this salutary principle with respect to those crimes,
which are only to the injury of individuals; and much
more must it apply to such as concern the peace and se∣curity
of the whole.</P>
<P>SEDITION is accordingly set down as a point of dittay in
our oldest book of law, the <HI>Regiam Majestatem</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">B. 4. G. 1. No. 2, 5; c. II.</NOTE>; which puts
the life and limb of the offender in the King's will, and
seems to class the offence, as in some measure at least allied
to that of treason.</P>
<P>AND to this rank it was accordingly raised by the statutes
of later times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was made Trea∣son in certain Cases.</NOTE> in certain instances, either in themselves
<PB N="488" REF="489"/>
more alarming to the State, or which, by experience, had been
found to be attended with danger of seduction and disturb∣ance.</P>
<P>ONE in particular deserves to be attended to; I mean the
act 1584, c. 130. which proceeds upon the narrative, that
the power, dignity and authority of Parliament had of
late years been called in some doubt; at least that some
had curiously travelled to introduce innovations with respect
to it. Therefore, it statutes and ordains, “that naine of
his leiges and subjectes presume or tak upon hand <HI>to im∣pugne
the dignitie and authoritie of the faidis Three Estates, or to
seek or procure the innovation or diminution of the power and au∣thoritie
of the same Three Estates, or ony of them,</HI> in time
cumming, under the paine of treason.”</P>
<P>IN like manner, the act 1661, c. 3. declares it to be trea∣son,
to call in question or impugn the King's sole and pecu∣liar
prerogative of calling, holding, proroguing or dissol∣ving
Parliament, and of consenting to the acts of the other
Estates.</P>
<P>UPON the same plan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was made Trea∣son in certain Cases.</NOTE> it is made treason by the act 1681,
c. 2. for any of the subjects of this kingdom, by writing,
speaking, or in any other manner of way, to endeavour the
alteration, suspension, or diversion of the right of succession
to the Crown according to the proximity of blood; or the
debarring the next lawful successor from the immediate,
actual, full and free administration of the Government, con∣form
to the laws of the kingdom. The like declaration
is made by the act 1685, c. 5. with respect to the giving or
taking of the Solemn League and Covenant, or writing in
defence of it, or owning it as an obligatory compact.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="490"/>
SOME of these are indeed the laws of arbitrary times;
but the principle which they enforce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was made Trea∣son
in certain Cases.</NOTE> that of maintain∣ing
the obligation and authority of the existing Govern∣ment,
is a principle of all times and situations; and is ac∣cordingly
adopted and applied in the statutes next to be
mentioned, which were made for the security of a Prote∣stant
Prince, and of the free settlement at the Revolution.
The very first statute of the first Parliament of William and
Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689, c. 1.</NOTE> anxiously provides against all challenge of the power
and authority by which the Crown had been settled on those
personages; and in this view it declares, “That it shall be
high treason for any persons to disown, quarrel or impugn
the dignity or authority of this Parliament, upon any
pretext whatever.” And this example is followed by
Queen Anne's first Parliament, who by the act 1703, c. 3.
ratify the said statute of William and Mary, and farther
declare, “That it shall be treason in any of the subjects of
this kingdom to quarrel, impugn, or endeavour by wri∣ting,
malicious and advised speaking, or other open act
or deed, to alter or innovate the Claim of Right or any
article thereof.”</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are not Trea∣son since the Union.</NOTE> each of these enactments, in its order, is an acknow∣ledgment
and confirmation of the doctrine of the common law;
proceeding as they do upon the notion of the wickedness of all
such practices which tend to impugn the principles, and shake
the security of the established Government, or to withdraw
from it the reverence and affections of the people; and
raising such offences from their natural rank of sedition,
to that of treason, by reason of the exigency of the times.
Being now again lowered from that rank by the statute
7. Anne, c. 21. which abolishes the peculiar treasons of
<PB N="490" REF="491"/>
the law of Scotland; these, and all other instances of trans∣gression
in the same sort, as <HI>mala in se,</HI> and evils too of
a very high order, retain, of course, their proper place
and quality as acts of sedition at common law; whereby
the offenders are justly exposed to the highest arbitrary pu∣nishment.
On these grounds, many convictions have of
late years been obtained. For, by a strange fatality, it
has been reserved for a season of the most perfect free∣dom,
and unrivalled prosperity, to instruct us in the fuller
knowledge of these pernicious disorders; and to fill our re∣cords
with trials for mutiny and disaffection, of such a
kind as was utterly unknown in former times, when our fore∣fathers
laboured under real grievances and oppressions.</P>
<P>ON the 8th of January 1793,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Sedition.</NOTE> three young men, Morton,
Anderson, and Craig, were convicted of attempting to raise
discontent in the minds of his Majesty's soldiers, and
seduce them from their duty; and of proposing to them to
drink a disloyal and seditious toast. They had sentence
of imprisonment for eleven months. On the 18th March
1793, sentence of imprisonment was also passed upon Ro∣bertson
and Berry, booksellers, for printing and publishing
a pamphlet, which in gross terms traduced the whole frame
and exercise of the British Government, as a system of ve∣nality
and oppression.</P>
<P>NEXT to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convictions of Sedition.</NOTE> was the case of Thomas Muir, advocate; who
was tried on a charge of uttering seditious speeches, cir∣culating
seditious publications, and forming associations,
for the purpose of constraining, and accomplishing, of their
<PB N="491" REF="492"/>
own authority, an alteration of the Government of this
country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 31. 1793.</NOTE> He was convicted, and adjudged to be transport∣ed
for fourteen years. Likewise, sentence of transportation
for the term of seven years, was given at Perth, on the 13th
September 1793, by the Judges on the Circuit, in the case of
Thomas Fische Palmer. This man was convicted of publish∣ing
a hand-bill, which described the King and Parliament
as in a league to enslave the country, and exhorted them to
combine and take decisive measures in their own defence.
These were followed, in the succeeding year, with the con∣victions
of William Skirving,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 6. &amp; 7. 1794.</NOTE> Maurice Margarot, and Joseph
Gerald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 13. &amp; 14. 1794.</NOTE> for their several parts and proceedings in the coun∣cil
termed the British Convention;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 13. &amp; 14. 1794.</NOTE> an assembly which ar∣rogated
to itself the character of representatives of the in∣habitants
of Great Britain, and in that capacity took mea∣sures
for debauching the affections of the people, as well as
to defy the Legislature, and resist any attempt which might
be made by statute or otherwise, to suppress them. All
these persons had sentence of transportation for fourteen
years. In England, on the like grounds, sentence of impri∣sonment
passed on the venders of the work entitled <HI>The
Rights of Man;</HI> and in many cases of seditious words ut∣tered,
or seditious hand-bills circulated among the people.
In the end, with the increase of this alarming evil, to which
the powers of the common law of England were found to be
unequal, recourse was at length had to the assistance of the
Legislature, who by statute 36th Geo. III. c. 7. authorised
the inflicting of the same punishments, that are competent in
Scotland according to the common law; and by means of
which, duly and steadily applied by the Scots Judges, the
growing audacity of the licentious in this quarter of the
kingdom, had in a great measure been repressed.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="493"/>
THE information which has thus by dear experience been
purchased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Real Sedition and Riot are different.</NOTE> and which is now so extensively diffused by means
of the many printed trials, hinders me to enlarge farther
on a subject, how important and interesting soever in itself,
where I cannot hope to add materially to the stock of know∣ledge,
of which the public are already in possession. This
observation, however, may be fit to be subjoined, that the
division which Erskine has made of sedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. Crimes, No. 29.</NOTE> into verbal
and real, does not seem to be a just division; that is, accord∣ing
to the description which he has given of those two
modes of the transgression. In his account of real sedition,
that author in some measure confounds it with the crime of
riot or convocation of the lieges; in as much as he holds it
to be committed, (at least if this is not his meaning, his ex∣pressions
are inaccurate), by an actual commotion only, or
breach of the peace. But truly the two offences differ in
more articles than one. <HI>First;</HI> Because an indictment may
be maintained for real sedition, as in all the instances al∣ready
quoted, though no manner of tumult or violence have
taken place. For the characteristic of sedition lies in the
forwarding, preparing, and producing such a state of things,
as may naturally issue in public trouble and commotion;
and it is opposed to the guilt of those who are actively en∣gaged
in the tumult or rising, if any ensues. Farther, riot
and sedition differ in their scope and object. The crime
of sedition is a State crime; which is levelled against the
Government, structure of laws, or political order of the land;
or at least has relation to some object of public and general
concernment; in regard to which if any <HI>hostile</HI> rising ensue,
the offender shall be guilty of no lower crime than treason.
Whereas the objects of riot or convocation of the lieges,
(as has already more fully been explained), are matters
<PB N="493" REF="494"/>
of local and private grievance; things in which a parti∣cular
place or neighbourhood only is concerned, and such
as in nowise tend to impugn the authority, or unsettle the
order or economy of the State. If, by handbill, or by
speech and discourse, any one excite the populace of such a
town, to rescue such a prisoner from gaol, or to plunder
such a vessel lying in the harbour with grain; and if a tu∣mult
actually follow; this is a riot, of which he the insti∣gator
is art and part: or if no riot follow, he is guilty of at∣tempting
to excite one. But if a person print and publish a
discourse, wherein he describes the Legislature as corrupt
and incompetent to its functions; and advises to hold a
convention of the people, who shall reform the Govern∣ment
after their own fancy, or upon a new and more popu∣lar
system, devised and proposed in this discourse; then is
the author guilty of <HI>real sedition:</HI> for he has taken a most
material <HI>step</HI> or <HI>measure</HI> towards disturbing the tranquillity
of the State. The members of such convention too, if it
shall assemble, are guilty of the same offence, though in
their meetings and proceedings they confine themselves to
the traducing of the Legislature, and the uttering of dis∣loyal
and inflammatory <HI>speeches:</HI> for the holding of any assem∣bly
for such purposes is a substantial <HI>act,</HI> which forwards
and facilitates, and in part executes the main project of de∣bauching
the minds of the people, and altering the Govern∣ment
of the land. But if, in farther prosecution of the same
plan, suggested by the seditious mover of this measure, and
having sufficiently inflamed the people for their purpose, the
members of this convention, and their adherents, shall pro∣ceed
to rise in hostile manner, though it should not be
with full equipment of arms, nor in regular array of war;
then is this rising no mob nor riot, but an act of war levied
<PB N="494" REF="495"/>
against the King; by reason of the high and public nature of
the enterprise. The crime of sedition, therefore, lies in the
stirring of such humours, as naturally tend to change and
commotion in the State. So near, indeed, is the alliance be∣tween
sedition and treason, that if, instead of sowing the
seeds of a hostile disposition to the Government, or preparing
such materials as in time may kindle into a flame, the of∣fender
shall seck the same object more immediately, by a direct
and definite exhortation to the people to rise at that particular
season and conjuncture, as advantageous for gaining their
ends; this measure, in like manner as a consultation to levy
war, seems to be nothing less than an act of compassing the
death of the King; being a decided and material step towards
the doing of that, which cannot be done without the plain
danger of the Sovereign's life<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">If the exhortation to rise in the case of Fische Palmer, had been more spe∣cial, direct and appropriate, instead of vague and general declamation, it would have fallen under the observation here made.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AGAIN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verbal Sediton and Leasing∣making distin∣guished.</NOTE> with respect to verbal sedition, Erskine has said,
that it is the same offence as leasing-making. And this, as
mentioned formerly, under the head of Leasing-making, may
thus far be true, (in which the situation is not peculiar),
that these transgressions may in some instances coincide, and
the same act be libelled with propriety, either as leasing∣making
or sedition; seeing they so often agree in this circum∣stance,
of their tendency to lessen the due reverence of the
Sovereign with his people. Yet still, as observed on the
same occasion, the two offences are materially distinguished;
both with respect to the means employed, which in the case
of sedition, may be far more various and extensive than in
leasing-making, and in the nature also of the object at which
<PB N="495" REF="496"/>
they aim; the one being done upon a project of disturbing
the State, the other out of special dislike of the particular
Prince upon the throne as a person, and with the purpose of
injuring his fame or giving him distress. Thus leasing-ma∣king
and sedition are not convertible terms. There is sedi∣tion,
which is not leasing-making, and leasing-making which
is not sedition; and either may be committed in many in∣stances,
without at all approaching to the guilt of the other.</P>
<P>The Legislature, accordingly, in framing the statute 1703,
c. 4. which abolished leasing-making as a capital crime, had
well understood and paid strict regard to this distinction.
For while they specified the act 1584, c. 134. “<HI>anent slan∣derers
of the King, his progenitors, estate and realm,”</HI> as one
of the proper statutes against leasing-making, which was to
be modified by the new law; they left untouched and en∣tire
another act of the same Parliament, the act 1584, c. 130.
which has for title “<HI>anent the authority of the Three Estates of
Parliament;</HI>” and which punishes as traitors, all persons who
shall travail to impair the power, authority, or dignity of
them, or any of them.</P>
<P>IT may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction of verbal and real Sedition.</NOTE> however, be true, that sedition may with propriety
be divided, as in Erskine's work, into that which is verbal and
that which is real; though as to any use which this will serve
in the practice, or even in the teaching of the law upon the
subject, it is not perhaps material nor worthy to be observed.
But serve what use it may, the distinction is not to be taken, as
in Erskine, from the form wherein the mischief is conveyed,
as by words and speeches, or by other proceedings; but
from the nature and substance of the thing itself that is
done. Under which rule, a pamphlet, a hand-bill, or even a
speech, according to the matter thereof, or the occasion of
<PB N="496" REF="497"/>
uttering it, may properly be referred to the one or the
other species of sedition. If all that can be said of the
composition is, generally, that it is of an inflammatory
kind; such as by the principles it inculcates, and the
obloquy it throws out on the management of public af∣fairs,
tends to the infusion of jealousy and discontent among
the multitude; but without proceeding to any proposal of a
plan, or set of active operations, as grounded upon these prin∣ciples,
and fit to be followed in the existing state of things;
this may with propriety be referred to the head of verbal se∣dition.
It was for a composition of this character, that Robert∣son
and Berry were convicted, as has been mentioned; and
William Stewart was outlawed upon a charge of the like
nature, on the 11th March 1793. But if, along with this
general exposition of false doctrines, or this passionate satyr
and reproach of the Government, the work shall proceed
to make a practical application of its principles, and to dis∣close
and recommend a course of measures for accomplish∣ing
a change or reformation of the State; as was done in an
address by Joseph Gerald to the people, which urged the
instituting of societies all over the land, and the uniting
of them by a general convention of delegates, to be called
and holden after a certain fashion there described; then is
this publication no other than an act of real and substantial
sedition. It is not the pure divulging of words, which may
corrupt the temper of those to whom they are addressed:
The opening of such a counsel, and the organising of the
future assembly and political relation, is a <HI>measure</HI> which pro∣motes
the project of change, and may as materially serve
the cause, as any thing that is done in pursuance of the pro∣posal.
The speeches, in like manner, which are made in the
regular meetings of the disaffected, as far as they contain
<PB N="497" REF="498"/>
any suggestion of activity, or chalk out a line of conduct to
be followed for making proselytes to their opinions, or
otherwise strengthening their interest, are to be viewed in
the very same light: They are not mere words; they are
the doing of business, and the consolidating of the enter∣prise
that is in hand. But after all, this distinction seems
not to be of any moment or advantage in the law. For either
species of the offence may be equally charged and tried un∣der
the general name of sedition; and there is no absolute
rule for distinguishing the degree of punishment of the two
kinds.</P>
<P>II. THE crimes of treason and sedition are the most inte∣resting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enlisting Men to serve a Foreign State.</NOTE>
as well as comprehensive of those offences which
are committed against the King or State. It is, however,
proper to mention, that by statute 9th Geo. II. c. 30.
which proceeds upon the just and salutary principle of hin∣dering
the sidelity of his Majesty's subjects to be corrupted,
and the power of the kingdom to be weakened, by with∣drawing
them from the realm, and attaching them to the mi∣litary
service of a foreign State; the following practices are de∣clared
to be felony, without benefit of clergy, and punishable
with death, 1. If any subject of Great Britain shall enlist or
enter as a soldier with any foreign Prince or State, without
his Majesty's leave. 2. If any person shall procure a subject
of his Majesty's so to enlist and enter: Or, 3dly, shall hire or
retain any such subject, with intent to cause him so enlist or
enter: Or, 4thly, shall procure any such subject to embark
or go beyond seas, with intent so to enlist. It appears that
doubts had been entertained how far the contracting, hiring,
retaining, or procuring with such intent, fell under the in∣tendment
of the statute, unless the enlisting-money were actu∣ally
<PB N="498" REF="499"/>
paid within this realm. To obviate this difficulty, it
was declared by statute 29th Geo. II. c. 17. that the several
things above mentioned should be felony, and punishable
with death, though no enlisting-money were paid or recei∣ved
on account of the engagement. On the first of these
statutes, libel was found relevant and sent to an assize, in the
case of Robert Cameron, in the month of January 1743. But
this pannel had a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>III. WITH respect to the offence of an enlisted soldier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crime of desert∣ing from Bri∣tish Army.</NOTE> in
deserting his Majesty's service;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blackst. vol. iv. c. 7. No. 5.</NOTE> it does not appear that this,
by our practice, as by special statutes in England, is a point
of dittay, or crime cognisable by the ordinary courts of law.
In 1644, a Parliamentary commission was indeed given to
the Bailies of Edinburgh, to hold courts upon runaway sol∣diers;
and under this authority<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The record bears that they had authority “<HI>per commissionem Dominorum Parliamenti in Parliamento seden. et Dominorum committium eorundem vertute eorum Litterae commissionis.</HI>”</NOTE> sentence of death was
passed upon James Freische, on the 13th of August 1644, for
leaving his company and colours in the course of an expe∣dition.
But this was a special interposition for that time,
and has not been followed by any general provision to the same
effect: so that the prosecution of this offence in Scotland
entirely rests upon the annual statute against mutiny and de∣sertion,
which punishes it with death, or such other punish∣ment
as a Court Martial shall think proper to inflict.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF OFFENCES (NOT TREASONABLE) AGAINST THE COIN.</HEAD>
<P>I AM to inquire in this chapter concerning those offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">COINING, &amp;c.</NOTE>
under the rank of treason or misprision of treason, which
are injurious to his Majesty's prerogative with respect to
the right of coinage for his dominions. And as an in∣troduction
to the knowledge of these, which continue to be
governed by the proper Scottish practice, it will be worth
while briefly to take notice of our ancient ordinances, and
course of practice with respect to this matter in general;
though now in part superseded by the communication of the
English treason laws.</P>
<P>IN entering upon this inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes relative to Coining.</NOTE> we have to remark nearly
the same state of things, as with respect to the forgery of
writings; namely, a succession of vague and ill digested sta∣tutes,
in which, taken by themselves, it would be difficult to
find the precise rule of the several modes of offence; but
which were probably rather intended as monitors towards
execution of the law at particular times, when there was
need of severity, than to introduce any thing new into it;
<PB N="500" REF="501"/>
and which are explained by a constant and invariable usage
of inflicting the highest pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CH XXVIII.</NOTE> with little distinction, on all
the transgressions of this class.</P>
<P>THE oldest act on the subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes relative to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the act 1449, c. 29. is alto∣gether
general; and only directs, “that all false strikers of
gold, silver, or of false groates and pennies, be searched and
written for, and broucht to the King to be punished as law∣will.”
Of the same character is the act 1540, c. 124. which
directs, that the offenders be sent to the Justice, “to be
justified for their demerites, after the form of the lawes of
the realme, made upon false cuinzieours.” As is also ano∣ther
law of the same Parliament, c. 99. which enjoins,
“That nae manner of man take upon hande for to wrong the
Crowne of weicht, or ony uther gold of weicht, throw
pretence of this act, under the paine to be accused and
punished as falsers of the King's graces money, conforme
to the commoun lawe and statutes of the realme.” Beside
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, which truly determine nothing, there are but two sta∣tutes
more; of which the last in date, the act 1563, c. 70.
would be entirely of the same vague description, if it were not
for that clause which invites to inform of such offences, and
promises to the informers, that they “fall have that ane
halfe of the escheit of all his lands and gudes, moveable and
unmoveable, of the said person or persones, offenders of
this present act and law.” Now this, though it does not
enact, implies, that the pains are the pains of treason; since
to that crime alone our custom has attached any forfeiture of
immoveable goods. The other and more ancient statute 1469,
c. 40. as printed in Skene's edition, and in Glendook's small
edition of the statutes, entirely relates to the uttering of
counterfeit black or copper money; which offence, however,
<PB N="501" REF="502"/>
it expressly punishes with death. As printed in the Black
Acts, and in Glendook's solio edition, the same statute has
these farther words: “that nae maner of person bring into
this realme ony strange black money of uther realmes,
<HI>or counterfit the King's money,</HI> under pain of death, as
said is.” Which last words apply the capital pain, alike
to the counterfeiting as to the home bringing and uttering.
But still, as Mackenzie has observed of this statute<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Obs. p. 74.</NOTE>, it in ei∣ther
part only relates to black money; though it no doubt
affords a very probable argument, that the pains of law were
not inferior for counterfeiting the more precious coins.</P>
<P>THE truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offences against the Coin were by Custom trea∣sonable.</NOTE> however, as already hinted, is, that the cus∣tom
of Scotland, grounded in some measure on the civil law<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Cod. lib. 9. tit. 24. Lex 1, 2.; Dieg. lib. 48. tit. 10. L. S.</NOTE>
and to which, in their general expressions, these enactments
must be held to have relation, was uniform and decided in
applying the punishment of death to all the offences of this
class; and that frequently, though not invariably, it even
punished them as treason, or at least as in some sort of a trea∣sonable
nature. I sind the following entries in one of the
oldest books of record: “June 22. 1554, <HI>Petrus Chaplaine,

Thus, on the 24th of November 1599, Walter Murray,
William Sympson, Walter Thomson, and Thomas Fraser, were
severally convicted of venting, or as art and part of forging,
or of knowing and concealing the feigning of false money;
such as ten shilling, two merk, and five pound pieces, as also
crowns, hat-pieces, and brass-pistoles gilt over. They had sen∣tence
to be worried at a stake, their bodies to be burned to
ashes, their lands, heritages, and possessions, to be forfeited, and
their moveables escheat. John Murray, convicted at the same
time, was banished in virtue of a special warrant from the King;
which proceeds upon the narrative of his confession, and in∣formation
against the others. On the 6th June 1601, Thomas
Glass, convicted of venting twelve false 50s. pieces of gold,
and 20 false five pound pieces, received by him from George
Drummond and the said Murray, had the like sentence of
death, forfeiture; and escheat. On 27th November 1601,
George Drummond, for treasonable <HI>outing</HI> of false hat-pieces,
crowns, four pound pieces, and four merk pieces, by him
bought from Hans Johnston, a Fleming, and others, has judg∣ment
in the same terms. As has Patrick Drummond, January
12. 1602; being convicted as art and part, redd, counsel,
and concealing, of the forging of five pound and 50s. pieces,
<PB N="503" REF="504"/>
by the said Hans Johnston. Sentence also passed to that effect
January 19. 1603, upon Alexander Thomson, mariner in
Borrowstounness, convicted of bringing home from England,
and outputting here, four score and six false merk pieces;
with only this difference, that the mode of execution was
by hanging on a gibbet. This also was the doom pronoun∣ced
on Robert Dow <HI>alias</HI> Menzies, and Alaster Maclaren,
<HI>ult.</HI> June, July 5. 1603, on their conviction “of the trea∣sonable
concealing of the forging, printing, and counter∣feiting
of false cunzie, printed and forged by the said Ar∣thur
Smith, in his smiddie, beside Banff.”</P>
<P>IN all these instances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forfeitures for Offences against the Coin.</NOTE> both in the charge and verdict, or
sentence the crime is characterised as treason, or of a treason∣able
nature. The same description is also given of it in the
following cases, where, however, no forfeiture of heritage is
decreed. On the 9th of February 1598, Elspeth Skirling, Ma∣rion
Hepburn, and Helen Bruce, spouse of Ralph Wallace, are
convicted of coining and uttering “Scots testones with the
cross,” (a trade which they are stated to have learned
from Hew Brunton an Englishman); and are condemned to
be worried at a stake, their bodies to be burnt, and their
moveables to be escheat. On the 3d March 1598, Ralph
Wallace<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The record in this case also mentions forfeiture of heritage, but the words are interlined in a blacker ink, and in a different hand.</NOTE>, husband of the said Helen Bruce, receives the
same doom on a letter from the King, “as convict of the
treasonable taking and apprehending of the said Hew
Brunton, Englishman, wha cunzied false cunzie within
the said Ralph's dwellinghous, and not putting him to jus∣tice.”
On the 13th and 20th July 1602, Alexander Reid,
<PB N="504" REF="505"/>
cuttler in Edinburgh, was sentenced to be hanged, and to
forfeit his moveables, for the “treasonable printing of
false twa merk pieces on the King's irons.” On 7th De∣cember
1602, Allan Napier, cuttler in Glasgow, for the
treasonable gilding of 27 eight and four merk pieces, was
adjudged to be worried at a stake, his body to be burned,
and his moveables escheat. Add to these, very numerous
cases for so short a period, that of Rennie and Reid, 15th
August 1637, who are hanged and <HI>for fault</HI> for coining half
dollars, grose-cus, and other foreign coins in Ireland, and
importing and vending them here.</P>
<P>THUS it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Later capital Convictions for Offences against the Coin.</NOTE> that at this ancient period our practice
capitally punished every sort of offence against the coin;
counterfeiting, vending, disguising, or importing; and equal∣ly
whether the coin were gold, silver or brass, home or fo∣reign
coin, if it were of a sort that was commonly current
in the country. Neither did the course of judgment alter
at a later period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 6. 1677.</NOTE> Thus, in the case of Patrick Burne and
John Hamilton, the libel concludes for death, forfeiture, and
confiscation of moveables and immoveables, and is found
relevant as laid. And it is only by warrant from the Privy
Council, which proceeds upon a narrative of their confession,
and other favourable circumstances, that the Court are au∣thorised
“to mitigate the sentence,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12. and Nov. 12. 1677.</NOTE> (as the record has it),
“to banishment for life.” On the 7th of April 1688, John
Allan has sentence of death on conviction of “frequent and
fraudulent passing and venting of false and adulterate
coynes,” some of which are charged in the libel to be
dollars of Culn, or some other foreign coinage. In
like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 12. and Nov. 12. 1694.</NOTE> John Lawson and Thomas Anderson, con∣victed
on their own confession, of <HI>vending and passing</HI> false
<PB N="505" REF="506"/>
coin, such as dollars and ducadoons, are sentenced to be
hanged<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The verdict “finds them guilty of the libel and indictment in the haill points and articles of the same, except as to actual coyning.” The sentence proceeds on narrative of the verdict, “whereby they are found guilty of the crimes of passing, venting and outputting false and adulterate money in manner mentioned in their indictment.”</NOTE>. And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22. &amp; 29. 1696.</NOTE> in the case of John Cochons, charged
with the coining of ducadoons, dollars and other <HI>broad mo∣ney</HI>
(as the libel calls it), this article after full debate, is
found relevant to infer the pains of death<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Finds the clipping of good broad and unclipped money, or causing the same to be vented, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer ane arbitrary punishment; as also, finds that the pannell, his coining, or causing to be coyned, of the said clip∣pings, and likeways of good broad money, false money, as false ducadoons, dollars, or other species, (which were for the greatest part adulterate), also rele∣vant to infer the pain of death and escheat of lands and goods, moveable and immoveable.”</NOTE> and escheat of
goods, moveable and immoveable.</P>
<P>IT appears from the proceedings in this case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 1696, c. 42. abolished the Forfeiture.</NOTE> that doubts
had now come to be entertained, how far the clipping of mo∣ney,
at least of foreign money, and vending it for good after
clipping, was to be held a crime of the same degree: for this
practice, which was a separate article of charge against Co∣chons,
was found only relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.
But within a few months, this doubt was put an end to by
the statute 1696, c. 42. (probably suggested by this very trial),
which made it a capital crime, by clipping, washing, filing,
or in any other manner of way, to diminish the proper coin
of the kingdom, or any other coin allowed to be current here.
This statute, however, entirely took away the treasonable part
of the doom; and ordered that the pains either of coining
<PB N="506" REF="507"/>
false money, or lessening the genuine coin, should only be the
pains of death and confiscation of moveables.</P>
<P>ON this footing matters stood at the time of the Union;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining again made Treason∣able at the Union.</NOTE>
when by the communication of the English treason laws,
these and all other high offences against the coin, were
again raised to the rank of treason, from which they had
been so lately degraded. We have therefore only to in∣quire
in this place, concerning those few articles of trans∣gression
in this sort, which not being treason by the law of
England, still remain under the rules of our ancient and
municipal practice.</P>
<P>1. SUCH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining Copper Money; if Ca∣pital.</NOTE> in the first place, is the coining of brass or cop∣per
money; which before the statute 15. Geo. II. c. 28.
was only accounted a misdemeanour by the law of England,
and was not liable to any severe correction. By that en∣actment,
which in its whole style, as well as in the narra∣tive
on which this part of it proceeds, seems to be purely
English, the penalty is two years imprisonment, and the
finding of surety for good behaviour during two years more.
But this restraint being also found insufficient, another sta∣tute
was passed, the act 11. Geo. III. c. 40. which proceeds
on the like narrative as the former, and raises the coining
of a halfpenny or a farthing to the rank of felony: which
is also enacted with respect to the taking, receiving, or put∣ting
off any quantity of counterfeit copper, not melted nor
broken down, for or at a lower rate or value than its deno∣mination
imports. No specific punishment is, however, men∣tioned
for either case.</P>
<P>IT seems to be very doubtful whether either of these sta∣tutes
can be construed to extend to Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining Copper Money; if Ca∣pital.</NOTE> where, so far
<PB N="507" REF="508"/>
from being reckoned a mere delinquency, and liable only
to some slight censure, the coining of copper money
may, by our old laws, be punished with the highest arbi∣trary
pains, or even with death. This last opinion may be
maintained on these grounds. 1. That by the express words
of the act 1469, c. 40, as printed in the Black Acts, or ori∣ginal
edition, the coining of false black money is a capital
crime. 2. By the words of the same act, as in the other
editions, even the importing, uttering, or taking of false
black money, is a capital crime; which affords a strong in∣ference
with respect to the coining. 3. The course of an∣cient
practice offers many instances of capital sentence for
the coining of brass money. 4. The act 1696, c. 42. says
generally, of the coining of false money, that it shall be pu∣nished
with death. These considerations were, however, dis∣regarded
in the case of William Deans;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 6. and Nov. 3. 4. 11. 1729.</NOTE> where the Court in∣deed
found the libel relevant to infer the pains of law, but
on conviction of the pannel as art and part of the coining,
condemned him only to the pillory and transportation<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“They find the pannel, his having, the time libelled, forged counterfeit or coined Scots sixpenny pieces, commonly called halfpennies, of brass, copper, or other base metal, resembling, or in imitation of the sixpenny pieces coined be lawfull authority, <HI>or</HI> his having uttered or output <HI>considerable</HI> quantities of such counterfeited halfpennies, knowing them to be counterfeited, or his having counterfeited the King's irons for coining, or his being art and part of the saids facts, <HI>separatim,</HI> relevant to infer the pains of law; and repelled the haill de∣fences proponed for the pannel; but allow him to adduce what proof he can for eliding any of the circumstances that may be brought in evidence against him.” The jury find “William Deane pannel, at the time libelled, aiding and assist∣ing to Joseph Skirmer and William Chomley, in casting and coining of the brass and base halfpennies, libelled.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="508" REF="509"/>
WHATSOEVER the pains of law be, they are incurred in
this, as in every other instance of coining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offence is com∣plete without uttering.</NOTE> by the bare act
of counterfeiting or throwing off the coin, though not ac∣companied
with any uttering or attempt to utter it in trade:
for the act is an unlawful and prohibited act, and which as
being attended with so much labour and trouble in the per∣formance,
is not supposed to be undertaken by any man but
for lucre<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 84.—Hawkins, b. 1. c. 17. No. 55.</NOTE>. On the other hand, it is not the striking of me∣tal
with a die, and the offering it to pass as a medium of
exchange, that always makes the crime. So to do is inno∣cent,
and in nowise liable to prosecution, if the piece is not
formed after the similitude of some known national coin; so
as it may circulate for such, and thus be forced upon those
to whom it is tendered in payment. As to all other pieces,
stamped with some private and peculiar device, to distin∣guish
them from the national money; these are no other
than medals, which no one is obliged to take at any va∣lue,
and whereof the fabrication, even when they are not
of the value put upon them, does not come under the
notion of coining; being no infringement of the royal
prerogative, nor in any degree tending to bring the national
faith into question. The benefit of this permission will
however be in favour of such pieces only, which are plainly
not intended to resemble the national coin; and not of those
which differ from it in some of the more minute parts only of
the device, which may probably pass unobserved in the course
of ordinary circulation. The law cannot be disappointed
under colour of such pretences, contrary to the plain import
of what is meant to be done<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In the case of King <HI>contra</HI> Varley, convicted of counterfeiting the impres∣sion of half-a-guin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, on a piece of gold which was <HI>bammered,</HI> and was not <HI>round,</HI> the Twelve Judges were of opinion, that this could not be held a coin <HI>to the similitude of half a-guinea,</HI> and recommended the man for a pardon. In the case of Mini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Harris, (Hilary Term 1776), convicted of coining a shilling, the Twelve Judges were of opinion, that the conviction was not good; because none of the base metal found upon the prisoners had yet been brought into that state in which it <HI>could</HI> have passed, or might be said to be the similitude of a shilling, In the case of John and Patrick Welsh in 1785, upon reference to the Twelve Judges from the assizes for the county of Hertford they were of opinion, that a counterfeit shilling, though quite smooth, and without impression of any kind, was sufficient to support an indictment of coining, having a <HI>reasonable</HI> likeness and similitude to the genuine coin, which time has so defaced, and which yet passes in circulation. The same was found in the case of Samuel Wilson in Oc∣tober 1783, before Mr Baron Eyre. Leache's Cases in Crown Law, No. 41. 71. 156. <HI>Ib.</HI> notes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="510"/>
2. THE offence also of knowingly uttering false Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish
coin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uttering false British Coin; how punishable.</NOTE> counterfeited within the realm, was by the law of Eng∣land,
at least in many cases, only a misdemeanour, until the
said statute 15. George II. c. 28. which punishes it with six
months imprisonment for the first offence; and, in the case of a
common utterer, (as there described), with imprisonment for
a year; and in case of a third offence, or of an act of uttering
by one who has been previously convicted as a common utter∣er,
with death. There is the like reason of doubt concerning
these, as the other clauses of this statute, whether they extend
to Scotland. We have seen, that according to the course of
the ancient Scottish practice, which in this is confirmed by
the opinion of Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. Falsehood, No. 9.</NOTE> the uttering, or <HI>outputting</HI> (as it
was termed) of false coin, stood in the same degree of guilt
as the coining; probably as being reputed to be done, (which
will often be the case), in league and concert with the
coiner. By one judgment, however, of a later date, that in
the case of Weir, Hallywell, and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 5, 6. 1699.</NOTE> the venting of the
false coin, even when joined to the procuring of materials sub∣servient
to the coining, was found relevant only to infer an
<PB N="510" REF="511"/>
arbitrary punishment<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Finds the indictment in sua far as relates to David Weir and James Ren∣wick, their buying the materials libelled, and venting false coin, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment.” These persons were not convicted; but <HI>John</HI> Weir and Hallywell were convicted of the actual coining, and had sentence of death.</NOTE> Yet in the still later case of Gabriel
Clarke;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 11, 26. and July 2. 1706.</NOTE> where the libel charged both coining and venting, and
in particular set forth as to the last, that it is “punishable by
the same pains, and as art and part of the foresaid crime,”
and so concluded for capital punishment, the Court found
the indictment, as libelled, relevant to infer the pains libel∣led.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A verdict was returned against this man, finding only certain presumptions proved; on which he was transported, July 2. 1705.</NOTE>
But whether in this they meant to sustain either
branch of it, or only the actual coining, as capital, cannot
from these expressions with certainty be said; nor have I
found any later precedent upon the matter. If in truth, a mi∣tigation
of the ancient practice on this head has taken place,
it may perhaps be attributed to the act 1696, c. 42. which
appears to have been intended as a general settlement of the
law relative to the coin; and does not, as naturally it might
have done, take any notice of the vending, as punishable in
the same manner with the counterfeiting. One thing is,
however, clear,—that to have the benefit of this mitigation,
the vender must be purely such, and without any concern
in the fabrication; for if the vending take place upon any
sort of society or combination with the coiner, by which the
profit of the whole adventure is to be shared between them,
this certainly makes the vender art and part of the capital
offence.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="512"/>
3. A THIRD offence, which is not treason by the law
of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uttering of false British coin brought from abroad.</NOTE> is the <HI>uttering</HI> of false British coin, which
has been counterfeited in, and imported from a foreign
country; for the statute of Edward only reaches him who
<HI>imports</HI> such money, in order to utter it<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—Hawkins, b. I. c. 17. No. 68—Hale, b. 1. c. 20. p. 225.</NOTE>. I need hardly
observe, that this offence cannot be subject to a higher pu∣nishment
than the uttering of false coin which has been
fabricated within the realm.</P>
<P>4. IN regard also to false <HI>foreign</HI> coin, such as is current
here by proclamation; it is to be observed, that according
to statute 1. and 2. Philip and Mary, c. 11. it is only the
importing it from abroad, with intent to utter, that is made
treason<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hawkins, b. 1. c. 17. No. 65, 68—Blackst. vol. iv. p. 89.</NOTE>. To utter only, though knowingly, such false fo∣reign
coin, imported by another, is not treason, but a lower
offence. According to the course of our practice, it would be
severely punishable, but not with death; at least, if it be
true, as already hinted, that even the uttering of the proper
coin of the realm cannot any longer be punished in that
way.</P>
<P>5. A FIFTH offence of this class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coining or light∣ening foreign Money.</NOTE> is that of coining within
Britain, or lightening there, such foreign monies as are
not current here by act of Parliament, nor by royal procla∣mation<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Blackst. vol. iv. p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN former times, and especially in the 15th century, ma∣ny
statutes were passed upon this matter of the currency of
<PB N="512" REF="513"/>
foreign coin; settling from time to time the several species
which should be allowed to pass, and often altering their
proportions to each other, and to our own coins, in the
hope probably by that means of gaining some advantage.
Once, indeed, it was attempted, (by statute 1597, c. 253.)
to call in all foreign money into the mint, and hin∣der
its having course among the lieges for the future.
But this, if intended as a perpetual law, was in a great
measure incapable of execution, and accordingly failed
to be observed; as appears from the capital convictions
which have been mentioned, for the fabricating or passing
of foreign coins. But in consequence of the Union, which
reduced the two kingdoms into one realm as to the matter of
coin, we are now subject to the same rule in that respect as
in England; so that nothing but statute or royal proclama∣tion
can raise any foreign money to the denomination of a
lawful coin, such as it is <HI>treason,</HI> by 1. Mary, st. 2. c. 6.
or 1. and 2. Philip and Mary, c. 11. to import for the pur∣pose
of uttering.</P>
<P>Now with respect to those foreign coins which are only
current by consent of parties, and are taken at a rate and va∣lue
as fixed by their agreement; it appears that to counter∣feit
them is misprision of treason, by statute 14. Elizabeth,
c. 3. But the vending of such false coin, or the lightening
and impairing of it, seems to be only a misdemeanour, to
which some lower punishment may be applied.<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">As for example, in the case of Allan, April 7. 1688; and of Cochons, July 22. 1696.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF OFFENCES AGAINST RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>IT now only remains to treat of the highest order of crimes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BLASPHEMY.</NOTE>
those which are injurious to religion, and, by weakening
the impression of its precepts, tend to loosen the foundations
of morality, and undermine the fabric of the national
strength and prosperity.</P>
<P>OFFENCES of this general description seem to be of two
kinds: in as much as some of them are directed only to the
hurt or dishonour of the National Faith, the Protestant
Reformed Religion; while others strike at the very roots
of Christianity, its fundamental doctrines, wherein all Chri∣stendom
agrees; or go still deeper, to the denial of those great
and original truths, which are the sources of all religion.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>I. BLASPHEMY.</HEAD>
<P>I. I SHALL begin with a transgression of the latter class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Blasphemy.</NOTE>—
the crime of Blasphemy,—or as some of the foreign doctors,
<PB N="514" REF="515"/>
with more fancy than propriety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP XXIX.</NOTE> have termed it, the crime
of treason or laese majesty against God; which consists in
the denial of his being, attributes, or nature, or in the ut∣tering
of impious and prophane things against God, or the
authority of the Holy Scriptures. According to the same
lawyers, who in this are supported by the acceptation of
the term in common language, blasphemy is only com∣mitted
by the uttering of such things, when it is done in
a scoffing and railing manner; out of a reproachful dis∣position
in the speaker, and, as it were, with passion against
the Almighty, rather than with any purpose of propagating
the irreverent opinion. The like sentiments, uttered dis∣passionately,
or conveyed in any calm and advised form,
though they are still criminal, are, however, according
to this opinion, a crime of a different sort; and rather a
heresy, or an apostacy, according to the degree of what is
said, than a proper blasphemy. Voet has described it thus:
“<HI>In Deum blasphemia, qua de Deo pugnantia cum ejus natura et
sanctitate, cum contemptu, et velut in contumeliam ejus proferun∣tur</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Comm. in Tit. ad Leg. Jul. Maj. No. 1.</NOTE>” And to the same purpose, Clarus, “<HI>Blasphemia est
omne convitium, contumelia, vel maledictum, in Dei nomen pro∣latum.</HI>”</P>
<P>As far as relates to the application of the term <HI>Blasphemy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Blasphemy.</NOTE> this distinction has not been strictly attended to in our prac∣tice.
The crime, with us, does not rest upon the foot of
common law; but has, in all its higher species, been brought
under the regulation of positive statutes, which, both in the
rubric and enactment, apply the name of Blasphemy to ei∣ther
mode of transgression. Nevertheless, with respect to
<PB N="515" REF="516"/>
the substance and punishment, those very statutes seem to
di∣stinguish
between the reproachful abuse, or malicious scof∣fing,
and the erroneous or heretical teaching. The act 1661,
c. 21. which is our earliest ordinance upon this subject, de∣clares,
in the first place, thus, “That whosoever, hereafter,
not being distracted in his wits, shall <HI>rail upon, or curse</HI> God,
or any of the persons of the blessed Trinity, shall be pro∣cessed
before the Chief Justice, and being found guilty, shall
be punished with death.” Under which words, it is cer∣tain
that the offender incurs the pain of death for one trans∣gression;
the thing being done in that spiteful and contumeli∣ous
manner, which is shocking to all who hear it, and is held
to indicate the wilful, depraved, and licentious disposition of
the speaker. The sequel of the statute is distinct from the
clause above recited, and materially different. “<HI>Likeas,</HI> his
Majesty, with advice foresaid, finds, statutes, and ordains,
that whosoever shall <HI>deny</HI> God, or any of the persons of the
blessed Trinity, <HI>and obstinately continue therein,</HI> shall be pro∣cessed,
and being found guilty, that they be punished with
death.” Now here, to the denying of any of the per∣sons
of the Godhead, but without cursing or railing at them,
the pain of death is only affixed in case of obstinate conti∣nuance
in the fault: wherein the Legislature have probably
proceeded on the opinion, that such errors may arise from
weakness only, or ignorance, or hasty decision, without ma∣lice
of heart; and may in some measure be atoned for by
public disavowal and expression of regret.</P>
<P>OUR only other statute concerning blasphemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against Blasphemy. 1695, c. 11.</NOTE> is that of
William and Mary, which passed a short time before one that
was made towards the same end, but on a less rigorous plan, in
England. It relates to the same sort of blasphemy as the latter
<PB N="516" REF="517"/>
part of the act 1661; and is to be considered as in explana∣tion
and supplement of that law, which is said to have been
found too narrow for the licentious opinions of those times.
It therefore extends the description of blasphemy to any
denial or challenge, whether in discourse or writing, “of
the authority of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments, or the Providence of God in the govern∣ment
of the world,” equally as to the denial of any of
the persons of the Godhead. And it proceeds to settle,
(which the former act, very improperly, had left indefinite),
who shall be accounted an <HI>obstinate</HI> offender, upon whom,
as irreclaimable, the pain of death shall be inflicted; name∣ly,
he who shall for the third time be convicted in this sort.
For the first fault, he is to make public atonement in sack∣cloth,
to the parish where the scandal was committed. For
the second fault, he is to pay a fine of a year's rent of his
real estate, and a twentieth part of his personal effects;
and he is also to be imprisoned till he again make satisfac∣tion
to the parish. “And for the third fault he shall be pu∣nished
by death as an obstinate blasphemer;” so that with∣out
a relapse after suffering the penalties of his first and se∣cond
fault, his life is not a forfeit to the law.</P>
<P>THE other mode of blasphemy, by railing at or cursi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
any of the persons of the Godhead, this statute has no re∣lation
to, and has left under the provisions of the former
act; whereby, in the single instance, and though not attend∣ed
with any aggravation of obstinacy, such irreverent and
contumelious words are still a capital crime. As this is
plain upon the statutes themselves; so it is confirmed by the
proceedings in the case of Aikenhead, in December 1696,
and that of Kinninmount, in November 1697; in which
last a plea to the contrary was overruled.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="518"/>
IN the statute 1695, we find the solution of that question,
suggested by Mackenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penitence is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Defence.</NOTE> touching the efficacy of immedi∣ate
contrition in such cases; whether it does away, or at
least lessens the fault, and will mitigate the judgment. Un∣der
that act, the censure of the first offence is nothing
more than a public humiliation, and confession of sorrow for
the fault; and the pains of the first and second offences can
only be inflicted in such circumstances, as show that the
pannel's professions of repentance are not worthy of regard.</P>
<P>ANOTHER question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Intoxication a Defence?</NOTE> also transiently spoken of by Macken∣zie,
has been resolved since his time, in the trial of Patrick
Kinninmount:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 22. and Dec. 13. 1697.</NOTE> I mean that which relates to blasphemy
committed in a state of intoxication. Kinninmount was
charged with passionate and violent railing against the God∣head;
with assirming that Christ was a bastard; calling a
person scum of Christ and—of God; threatening another with
violence unless he would abjure our Saviour; defying the
power of God and Christ to hinder him of his will; and
other the like speeches, of which it would be difficult to say
whether they were more impious or absurd. His defence
against this high charge was that of intoxication at the time,
or rather of fury and distraction arising from excess in liquor.
But the Court would not sustain his plea, though stated
in these strong terms, to the effect even of alleviating the
fault<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“And finds the defence, that the pannel was surious or distracted in his wits, relevant, in the terms of the act of Parliament; but repels the allegiance of sury or distraction arising from drunkenness; and also, repels the haill other defences proponed for the pannel.”</NOTE>. The libel was not however prosecuted to any is∣sue.
<PB N="518" REF="519"/>
I have ventured elsewhere<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Chapter I. p. 40.</NOTE> to express a doubt concern∣ing
the propriety of this decision.</P>
<P>THE only instance of capital judgment for blasphemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capital Con∣viction of Blas∣phemy.</NOTE> is in
the case of Thomas Aikenhead, which seems to have been
tried with a rigorous disposition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 23. &amp; 24. 1696.</NOTE> Not, however, on the
part of the Court, whose interlocutor on the relevancy of
the charge is correct<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“Find the cursing or railing upon any of the Persons of the blessed Trini∣ty, relevant to infer the paine of death.”</NOTE>, and who, upon the verdict returned
to them, could pronounce no other sentence than they did;
but on the part of the assize, who found the pannel guilty of
railing at and cursing our Saviour, without any proof of his
having directly done so, and upon inference only from opi∣nions
which he had occasionally vented. Now, in the trial of
those crimes which consist in the uttering of words, and are
only made capital by statute, it seems to be the sounder, and
certainly is the more humane construction, that the pan∣nel
is not to be condemned upon arguments and consequences
deduced from his discourse. The thing itself which the sta∣tute
has forbidden to be uttered, must be said explicitly and
directly; in such a palpable and open form, that every one
who hears the words shall know the law to be infringed. That
what he has said is an offence of the same class, or tends to
the thing which is prohibited, or even that in the general
opinion it is equally or more criminal, will not justify the
applying of this rigorous law to any thing which its expres∣sions,
general as they are, do not comprehend. And as far
as the capital punishment is more severe than any other; so
wide is the step from that which the pannel has affirmed, to the
<PB N="519" REF="520"/>
conclusions and inferences which may thence be drawn
against him.</P>
<P>I HAVE found in the record but one instance more of pro∣secution
for blasphemy: This was against Francis Borthwick,
who, on the 15th June 1681, was fugitate upon a libel which
charges that he had railed at Christ, and had become a Jew,
and suffered circumcision.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the competent judicature for such trials.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jurisdiction in Trial for Blas∣phemy.</NOTE>
The execution of the act 1695, in as far as concerns the first
and second offences, is committed to inferior Judges; but
the trial of the third is reserved to the Lords of his Majes∣ty's
Justiciary alone; which is also true, by express provi∣sion
of the statute 1661, as to trial for railing at or cursing
any of the Persons of the Godhead.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>II. PROPHANITY.</HEAD>
<P>AKIN to this, though lower in degree, is the offence of
Prophanity. Under which general appellation is included
the practice of prophane cursing and swearing; all indecent
scoffing at religion; the disturbance of divine worship; and
also the open prophanation of the Lord's day, by the doing
of such acts thereon, whether for lucre or amusement, as are
inconsistent with the command of God on that head, and
with the salutary ends which that institution is excel∣lently
fitted to promote.</P>
<P>I. THE chief statutes with respect to cursing and swearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statutes against prophane Swear∣ing.</NOTE>
are those of Charles II. 1601, c. 19. and 1661, c. 38. No. 25.;
<PB N="520" REF="521"/>
which annex pecuniary pains to it, in proportion to the rank
of the offender, (whereof one half to go to pious uses within
the parish, and the other to the informer, and to defray the
expence of process); and which in case of inability to pay,
allow corporal punishment to be inflicted according to the
degree and repetition of the fault, and the direction of for∣mer
laws. The corporal pains pointed out for that case by
the older statutes, 1551, c. 16. and 1581, c. 103. are chiefly
those of imprisonment, and setting in the jugs or stocks, or
in case of great obstinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Judge and Pro∣secutor.</NOTE> banishment. The execution of
these laws, is by the statute 1661, c. 38. in a particular
manner committed to the Justices of Peace; and by 1696,
c. 31. it is made competent for any person to pursue.</P>
<P>2. THE act 1661, c. 38.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scoffing at Re∣ligion.</NOTE> applies the same penalties, as in
case of cursing and swearing, to all “who shall be mockers
or reproachers of piety, and the exercise thereof.” Which
words seem to reach all reviling, scossing at, and reproaching
of the Established Church, its ordinances, discipline, or worship.
The same thing is mentioned as a known offence in these
statutes, 1690, c. 25.; 1696, c. 13.; 1701, c. 11. Indeed it
is not to be doubted, that even at common law, all speeches
or practices which favour of blasphemy, or are to the plain
contempt and mockery of religion, fall under the cogni∣sance
of the Magistrate as scandalous indecencies; and are
punishable with the same censures as those which the sta∣tutes
against cursing and swearing have appointed.</P>
<P>3. THE first provision against the disturbance of public wor∣ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbance of public Worship.</NOTE>
is in the act 1551, c. 17. which was made at a time
when this protection had become necessary, through the in∣creasing
contempt of the then established religion. The pe∣nalties
<PB N="521" REF="522"/>
appointed in this statute are pecuniary. It was follow∣ed
by a provision towards the same end, in support of the re∣formed
Religion, the statute 1587, c. 27.; which punishes the
culprit with escheat of moveables, (sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving the right to in∣flict
a higher punishment if any great violence is done);
and applies this correction to the raising of any fray or
disturbance in the kirk-yard, equally as in the kirk, to the
troubling or dispersing of the people assembled there for
religious purposes. Interlocutor of relevancy was given up∣on
a charge of this sort, in the mutual libels between Forbes
of Barns and Reid of Bara;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 13 &amp; 14. 1703.</NOTE> which were occasioned by an
indecent contest between them in the church, relative to
the right or possession of a pew<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Verdict was returned against Forbes, but was set aside by an informality.</NOTE>. Again; in 1726, James
Pyrie was indicted at common law, as having, at the head
of a multitude, violently invaded and dispersed a congre∣gation
assembled in a kirk-yard for divine service; and be∣ing
convicted he had sentence of banishment for seven years
from that part of Scotland beyond the Tay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 14, 15, 16. 1726.</NOTE> under pain of
transportation in case of return. In the case also of Wil∣liam
Black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. 1714.</NOTE> Alexander Troup, William Gordon and others,
relevancy was found upon their forcibly hindering a preach∣er
to obtain entrance of the church; or their breaking up of
the church-door; or carrying off the church-bible, sand-glass
or pulpit-cloth; or their keeping garrison in the church with
intent to exclude the minister<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">“They find the said pannels, or any one of them, assembling together in a tumultuous manner, and breaking open the church-door libelled, or being art and part thereunto; and <HI>separatim</HI> the taking away the church-bible or sand∣glass, glass, or pulpit-cloth, or bason, about the time libelled, or being art and part of the same, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and damages, and ex∣pences: And find likewise, the said pannels, or either of them, their forcible hindering, about the time libelled, Mr Anderson, sent by the Presbytery to preach in the church above mentioned, from having access thereunto, or to preach therein, or being art and part therein, relevant to infer an arbitrary pu∣nishment, and damages, and expences: And also, the said Lords find the said pannels, or either of them, their keeping garrison, in the said church, as libel∣led, relevant to infer an arbitrary punishment, and damages, and expences.”</NOTE>. They were convicted of
<PB N="522" REF="523"/>
breaking open the church-door, and had sentence to be im∣prisoned
severally for different periods, to make payment
of L. 50 of costs, and to find caution to abstain from such
disturbances in future.</P>
<P>4. To secure the due observance of the Lord's day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking of Sun∣day.</NOTE> we
have a long succession of statutes, most of them passed after
the Reformation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1503, c. 83. 1579, c. 70. 1592, c. 124. 1593, c. 163. 1594, c. 201. 1661, c. 18. 1663, c. 19.</NOTE> which prohibit the holding of fairs or
markets; all buying and selling, working, gaming, or play∣ing;
resort to ale-houses or taverns; salmon-fishing; going of
salt-pans, mills or kilns; hiring of reapers; and in general
all use of ordinary labour, employment, or sport upon that
day. The penalties appointed by these laws, and especially
by 1661, c. 18. which is one of the latest of them, are chiefly
pecuniary fines, with a power of ordering corporal punishment
in case of inability to pay; but which the Judge could not
probably, for a first offence, make use of to any greater extent
than that of inflicting a short imprisonment, or setting the
offender in the stocks or jugs. For a third offence, however,
by 1594, c. 201. the offender forfeits his moveables, and
brings his person in the King's will. Also, by 1579, c. 70. the
goods exposed to sale in a fair or market upon Sunday, or in
a kirk or kirk-yard upon any day, are escheated to the use
of the poor of the parish. In the article too, of holding
<PB N="523" REF="524"/>
<HI>public market</HI> within royal burgh, the prohibition is not li∣mited
to the twenty-four hours between Saturday and Mon∣day;
but, by the act 1663, c. 19. reaches both these days
themselves. The reason is, that through the preparation
for market, early on Monday morning, and still more by the
prolonging of the market in drinking and revelling on Sa∣turday
evening, there is risk that the holiness of the Lord's
day may be violated, and disturbance given to the pious and
well-disposed.</P>
<P>THE record offers but one instance of this sort of charge
within the present century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking of Sun∣day.</NOTE> viz. the case of Captain Moodie,
of the 1st August 1712, where, “as to the article against
the said Captain Moodie for compelling James Anderson,
&amp;c. to break the Sabbath day, by obliging them on the
said day, and at the time libelled, to cross Pentland Frith,
and carry great burdens openly over land, find the same
relevant to infer a pecuniary mulct against the said
Captain Moodie.” The diet in this case was afterwards
deserted.</P>
<P>THE execution of the laws against these different modes
of prophanity is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compètent Judge and Pro∣secutor.</NOTE> by stat. 1661, c. 38. in a particular manner
committed to the Justices of Peace; but it also belongs by the
common law, as well as by the words of many later statutes,
such as 1672, c. 22.; 1695, c. 13.; 1696, c. 31.; to all other
both supreme and inferior Judges, for their bounds, or the
parishes where they reside. The pecuniary mulcts are ap∣plicable,
one half to the use of the poor, and the other
to defray charges, and reward the informer. The prosecution
is competent at instance of any person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693, c. 40.</NOTE> and in one statute
<PB N="524" REF="525"/>
it is even enjoined every Presbytery, to name an informer
and prosecutor for the district.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<HEAD>III. HERESY.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER offence of the same class with the above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Was at first pu∣nished in the Clerical Courts.</NOTE> but
of which, happily, there is now no occasion to treat any
otherwise than as an article of history, is that of heresy;
which consists in the profession of such opinions as do not
go to the entire subversion of Christianity, but only to the
denial of some of its material articles or points of faith.
How mysterious and subtile soever any of these might be,
no one but knows the extreme danger which once attended
the misunderstanding of them; and how deep the guilt was
held of any the slightest deviation, whether out of wilful∣ness
or ignorance, from the absolute standard of the pure
and orthodox faith. To determine what this was, and to
detect and punish the error, was a department of business,
which, according to the notions of former times, was above
the cognisance of any secular court, and even beyond the
power of the Legislature, in any manner of way to regulate
or interfere with. But, (which rendered these pretensions
so much the more grievous), from this of attributing the
sole jurisdiction in such matters to the Spiritual Courts, the
just consequence did not ensue, of limiting the censures to
be inflicted for those errors of opinion, to such as were <HI>pro
salute animoe,</HI> and of a proper spiritual nature; as by the en∣joining
of alms or penance, the refusal of admission to the
privileges of the Church, or throwing out the heretic from
the society of Christians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aid of secular Arm afterwards lent them.</NOTE> It is true, this was the course
of discipline in the beginning; but from which, at an early
period, the clergy were every where tempted to depart, and,
<PB N="525" REF="526"/>
in aid of their censures, to call in the temporal expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">HERESY.</NOTE>
of immediate punishment in the offender's goods and person.
Nor did they long confine themselves to those inferior penal∣ties
of this sort, which their own courts were in some countries
suffered to inflict, such as imprisonment, fine or confiscation;
but extended their pretensions, and were not content till they
engaged the civil power to interpose for them with its coercive
authority, and undertake the odious office of executing the
highest vengeance of the Church, upon whatsoever person
it delivered over as a heretic convicted to the secular arm.</P>
<P>THIS is the general outline of the history of the thing all
over Europe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statute on this Head.</NOTE> and with us of Scotland, as elsewhere, laws
were enacted, which appointed the Church this service and
assistance, when need should be, for containing her chil∣dren
in their duty. Especially, the act 1424, c. 28. ordains,
“That ilk bishop shall garre inquire to the inquisition of he∣resie,
quhair onie sik beis founden, and that they be pu∣nished
as law of halie kirk requires. And gif it misteris,
that secular power be called in support and helping of ha∣lie
kirk.” How far the secular arm was to interpose, in
aid of the spiritual censures, the statute does not say; nei∣ther
does it pretend to describe or limit the offence itself.
But we know that even before this time, and while there was
no statute for it, the general example of Europe had come to
be followed here, in carrying the interposition to the utmost
length<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In 1408, John Resby, one of the followers of Wickliffe, was delivered over▪ to the secular arm; and was burned at Perth. Bower, 441–443.</NOTE>; and that as the sentence of the Church consigned
the soul of the heretic to eternal perdition, so the tempo∣ral
power delivered over his body to the flames.</P>
<P><PB N="526" REF="527"/>
WITH the Reformation, two great and salutary changes
took place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of Prac∣tice on the Re∣formation.</NOTE> Instead of being left to the variable and uncer∣tain
construction of an ecclesiastical court, the standard of
doctrine was now settled, and made public by national au∣thority,
in a statute which engrosses the full confession of
the Protestant doctrine of faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1567, c. 3.</NOTE> And at the same time,
though without the aid of any express law, and owing to the
absolute downfal of that domineering power which had
alone supported so gross an abuse; the lieges gained a pro∣tection
against all severe punishment in their persons, upon
any sentence of the Church for heretical opinions. I say
against all severe punishment <HI>in their persons:</HI> For so far
was this from being true with respect to their estate, that by
two statutes of the year 1609, (c. 3. and c. 4.) the rents and
revenues of all persons excommunicated for religious causes,
were declared to be escheated to the King; and an injunc∣tion
was given not to <HI>expede</HI> any heritable title in their fa∣vour,
either in the King's Chancery, or in that of any sub∣ject
superior. Nay more; even as to their persons, it still
continued to be law, and was provided for by express sta∣tutes,
first in the Presbyterian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1572, c. 53. 1661, c. 25. 1663, c. 23.</NOTE> and afterwards in the Episco∣pal
times, that letters of horning and caption should issue
upon sentence of excommunication; and should be followed
with the ordinary consequences of that sort of civil rebel∣lion,
for compelling them to obey the sentence, and be re∣conciled
to the Church.</P>
<P>AT the Revolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil pains of Excommunica∣tion abolished.</NOTE> however, by which time long expe∣rience
had taught men some of the inconveniences of this
alliance of the Church and the temporal estate; all acts en∣joining
civil pains upon sentence of excommunication were
rescinded, by the statute 1690, c. 28. The same thing was
<PB N="527" REF="528"/>
again declared by the statute 10. Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NON-CONFOR∣MITY.</NOTE> c. 7. which even
takes the farther step of prohibiting any Judge to lend
his aid for obliging any one to appear before a church court,
when summoned in a process for excommunication, or to
obey such sentence when given. In this manner, at length
was established, the complete, and, (as I must certainly
esteem it), salutary separation and independence of the ec∣clesiastical
and civil powers. The conviction, therefore, of
heresy, in the spiritual court, is not, at this day, the ground
of any forfeiture or penalty, in either the person or estate
of the offender.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>IV. NON-CONFORMITY.</HEAD>
<P>BUT although,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Laws against Non-conform∣ists.</NOTE> at the Reformation, the adherents of the
new establishment, thus vindicated themselves from that
state of bondage in which their ancestors had lain under the
clergy; this was not done, in the main, out of any dislike
of persecution for religious opinions, nor with any purpose
of introducing a comprehensive scheme of toleration; a
thing, how just and reasonable soever in itself, of which there
was not an example any where, till a much later period in
the history of Europe. On the contrary, with almost equal
zeal as the votaries of that religion under which they had
endured so much oppression, they laboured after the like ob∣ject,
of suffering none but <HI>the religion</HI> (as their term for it
was) within the realm; and reducing all their fellow sub∣jects
to a strict conformity to the national worship. I pass
over the statutes 1567, c. 9. and 1609, c. 5. which disabled
all but the members of the Presbyterian Church to hold any
whatsoever public office or employment. For whether it be
<PB N="528" REF="529"/>
true or not, according to the opinion of an enlightened nation
at this day, that such a preference is at all times a proper and
necessary barrier to a national establishment of religion; this
will not decide the policy of such a measure, applied to the
recent establishment of Presbytery, which had such a host of
powerful and implacable enemies to contend with. But not
content with this security, and with passing a long train of
rigorous statutes, (of which more particularly afterwards),
against the teachers and adherents of the ancient faith;
the Legislature proceeded to punish for bare non-conformity,
consisting only in the failure to hear the word, or receive the
sacrament, in the reformed kirks of the realm. To that pur∣pose
is the enactment of the statute 1600, c. 17. (in some
measure copied from the temporary act 1572, c. 45.) which
imposes a fine upon every such non-communicant, according
to his degree.</P>
<P>IT is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Laws against Non-conform∣ists.</NOTE> that, though expressed in general terms, this
statute, as some of its expressions indicate, was in the main
levelled against Papists; the grand enemy, of whom the
dread did for a while, in some measure, withdraw attention
from the lesser differences of opinion with respect to church-government
and form of worship, among the Protestants them∣selves.
But, as in the warfare with this adversary, the people
of Scotland had imbibed a great jealousy and bitterness of
disposition in all matters of religion; so it was not long be∣fore
an almost equal rancor and animosity broke out be∣tween
the two communions of Protestants, the Episcopals
and Presbyterians: and this was heightened to the utmost
by the long train of mutual injuries and persecutions, which
they underwent from each other in the course of the civil
war. On the re-establishment, therefore, of Episcopacy, at
<PB N="529" REF="530"/>
the Restoration, not only were such of the Presbyterian teach∣ers
ejected from their livings, who would not submit to a new
institution by the Bishops, (by which means nearly a third of
the whole parishes in the kingdom were deprived of their pas∣tors);
but measures were taken to silence and extirpate them,
by insisting for the same strict conformity of every man to the
national discipline and worship, which the Presbyterians
themselves had so lately exacted; and by proceeding against
all schismatical withdrawers from the Church, though not
guilty of any offensive act, or public exercise of another form
of worship, as persons disaffected to Government, and movers
of sedition.</P>
<P>THE act 1663,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Laws against Non-confor∣mists.</NOTE> c. 2. contains an open declaration to that
purpose; and inflicts sundry penalties and confiscations, ac∣cording
to the rank of the offenders, upon all “who shall
hereafter <HI>ordinarily</HI> and <HI>wilfully</HI> withdraw and absent them∣selves
from the ordinary meetings of divine worship in
their own parish-church on the Lord's day, whether on
account of Popery or other disaffection to the present go∣vernment
of the Church.” The same injunction is re∣newed
in the act 1670, c. 7. which bears the same reasons,
and heightens the pecuniary penalties, as well as applies
them to every case of absence from the parish-church for
three successive Sundays, without a reasonable excuse, to be
judged of by the Magistrate; whom to encourage in his
inquiries concerning transgressors, the act rewards him with
a certain share of the fines. Farther, in regard to any he∣ritor
who should withdraw for the space of a year; it autho∣rised
the Privy Council to call him before them, and tender
him a bond for his subscription, obliging him not to rise in
arms against the King's authority, nor to countenance any
<PB N="530" REF="531"/>
who should do so; which bond if he refused, he was then to
be banished, or to be secured at pleasure of the Council, beside
forfeiting his moveables and the profits of his real estate for
his lifetime. This was a law for a limited time; but was
continued during the King's pleasure by statute 1672, c. 17.
There were, besides, a great number of supplementary acts,
relative to disorderly baptisms and marriages; the taking up
of lists of suspected persons; rendering account of the con∣victions;
and other the like matters, calculated to secure an
effectual compliance with the will of the Legislature on this
interesting subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681, c. 6.</NOTE> At length, in 1681, the noted Test-Act was
passed, which imposed an oath upon all persons in stations of
public trust, civil, ecclesiastical, or military, binding them to
the statutory confession of faith in every article; acknowledg∣ing
the King's supremacy over all persons, and in all causes,
as well ecclesiastical as civil; and disowning any power to
meet in assemblies without leave of his Majesty, to treat
of any public matter relative either to the State or the
Church.</P>
<P>WHILE such was the temper of the times with respect to
the negative offence of withdrawing from the national
Church;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Conventicles.</NOTE> it is easy to imagine, how little chance there was
of any indulgence being shown to acts of positive non-conformity,
by the public use of other forms of worship.
Under the management of Lauderdale, who in the end be∣came
the sole minister for Scotland, and who, though at
bottom a zealous Presbyterian, scrupled not to promote the
flrongest measures against his brethren of that communion,
a violent law was enacted against <HI>conventicles:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1670, c. 5.</NOTE> for so the
meetings were called in which those deluded people, either
<PB N="531" REF="532"/>
privately and under cover, or in the fields, assembled to hear
their favourite preachers, and make worship after their own
fashion. By this statute, heavy fines, to be made effectual
by summary imprisonment, were imposed upon all persons
not authorised by a Bishop, who should preach, pray, or ex∣pound
the Scriptures in any meeting for worship, except in
their own houses and with those of their own family; or who
should even be present at any such meeting. And as to
preaching, praying, expounding the Scriptures, or convening
persons in a field conventicle, (or one held in a house, but so
numerous that part of the audience stood without doors,
which was to be accounted a field conventicle); this trans∣gression
it punished with death and confiscation of moveables,
even for the first offence. By statute 1681, c. 4. very erroneous∣ly
entitled “<HI>for securing the peace of the country,</HI>” the pecuni∣ary
penalties were doubled; and additional penalties were
appointed for certain cases. At length, the evil being
daily more and more exasperated by this irritating course
of treatment; it was judged necessary to apply the pain of
death to all preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685, c. 8.</NOTE> or even presence, in those meetings for
worship, which it terms “Nurseries and Seminaries of rebel∣lion,”
whether held in house or field. And to enforce the
execution of these oppressive edicts, they were followed with
a long train of jealous and arbitrary provisions, exciting in∣formers,
compelling evidence, making one person answerable
for another, indemnifying for the slaughter of offenders, and
so forth; which, to be sure, the iniquity of the main law,
and the aversion, generally speaking, of the lower orders of
the people to the Episcopal communion, rendered necessary,
if so faulty a system of management were to be persisted
in.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="533"/>
OPPRESSIVE as these edicts were in themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rigorous Exe∣cution of these Laws.</NOTE> they were
rendered still more so by the rigorous proceedings in execu∣tion
of them, on the part of the King's servants for Scot∣land,
our countrymen, Middleton and Sharp; who not only
strained the law and their own authority to the utmost, but
even ventured to elude the express instructions of their
master on the side of mercy. A sort of high commission
court was appointed by the Privy Council, to execute the
ordinances against non-con∣formists. And in aid of this tri∣bunal,
if in any part of the country the people had general∣ly
deserted the parish churches; there, as if in a state of re∣bellion,
a military force was sent among them, to be quar∣tered
on the supposed delinquents, whom the commanders,
of their own authority, and without pretence of trial, obli∣ged
to ransom themselves by the payment of fines and com∣positions,
according to their pleasure. At a later period, and
under the false pretence of a rebellion in the western coun∣ties,
which only consisted in the refusal of the landlords to
sign an illegal bond, by which they were to answer for their
tenants; an army of undisciplined Highlanders were let loose
to live at free quarters on the lands of these recusants, where
they committed at will every manner of spoil and violence.
No wonder, that under such usage, men who were natural∣ly
sullen and bigoted, and who thus found themselves hunt∣ed
as it were like wild beasts, in return for the submissive be∣haviour
with which they had seen their chosen establishment
overthrown, contracted a fierce and savage nature; which at
length broke out in an insurrection, and required the use of
that military force, which had at first been so wantonly employ∣ed
against them. But this resistance, had, for the time, only
the effect of bringing down upon them the still more severe
vengeance of the authors of this blind and cruel policy; a
<PB N="533" REF="534"/>
vengeance which the sufferers might indeed have avoided,
but only by renouncing the Covenant; which apostacy these
deluded enthusiasts, (surely scarce deserving of hatred for
such an opinion, even if they had not been fixed in it by per∣secution),
believed to be at the hazard of eternal perdition.</P>
<P>IN Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against Non-conformists repealed in 1690.</NOTE> the Revolution of 1689 was still more com∣plete
in the Church, than in the State. The Presbyterian
worship and form of government, as agreeable to the majo∣rity
of the people, were re-established; and by the acts 1690,
c. 5. and 27. all the laws against conventicles, or for en∣forcing
uniformity of worship, or establishing the tests, and
in general, all laws prejudicial to, or derogatory from the
Presbyterian model, were rescinded without any reservation.
But while the peace and security of the new establishment
were thus provided for; we now happily avoided the ex∣cesses
into which the zeal of former times had betrayed us.
Papists, indeed, still continued to be marked out by new
laws, as the peculiar objects of jealousy and aversion. But
no statutes for conformity were now renewed, similar to
those of which we have taken notice, as passing on the first
establishment of Presbytery; nor did we even think it ne∣cessary
to imitate our neighbours of England, in establish∣ing
a test for the support of our national faith, such as that
by which with them the dissenters from their Church are
excluded from all communion of either civil or military
trust or employment. Our only ordinance of this sort, is
that very moderate provision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1706, c. 7.</NOTE> being part of the treaty of
Union, which orders that all persons bearing office in any
university, college, or school, shall subscribe the confession
of faith, and adhere to the government and discipline, of
the Presbyterian Church.</P>
<P><PB N="534" REF="535"/>
IT was not, however, to be expected, that between the ri∣val
communions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Present Laws as to Non-conformists.</NOTE> which had so long been in a state of war∣fare,
and had each enjoyed the exultation of overthrowing
the other, all memory of former injuries should instantly be
effaced, and things at once subside into a state of harmony
and quiet. It appears that jealousy had arisen on the part of
the Presbyterian pastors, with respect to the baptizing of chil∣dren,
and the celebration of marriage; two articles of which
they claimed the exclusive right, to the prejudice of the
ejected Episcopal clergy who had interfered with them there∣in;
and who, by statute 1695, c. 12. were prohibited so to do,
under pain of being imprisoned, till they should find caution to
leave the kingdom. On the other side, as was likely to happen;
the zeal of the Presbyterians had moved them to molest and
disturb the Episcopal congregations, in their meetings for
religious worship. To cut off, therefore, all doubt on so in∣teresting
a subject, and repress the growth of such disorders,
it was thought proper, by a positive statute, to declare their
right of assembling for divine worship, to be performed af∣ter
their own manner; but this, under such provisions as
might secure the purity of the manners of their pastors, and
also the soundness of their doctrines and principles, as well
political as ecclesiastical. To reconcile these two objects,
was the purpose of the statute 10. Anne, c. 7. commonly
termed <HI>the Toleration Act;</HI> which prohibits any one to molest
them in their meetings under the penalty of L. 100, to be
decreed upon conviction in the Court of Justiciary, or other
competent Court.</P>
<P>THUS, the result of these several changes, is in the entire
abolition of all censures for non-conformity, either nega∣tive
or positive; with the exception of the members of the
Church of Rome, and also of the members of the Church of
<PB N="535" REF="536"/>
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">POPERY.</NOTE> if they comply not with the reasonable conditions,
which are prescribed in the Toleration Act. We are now,
therefore, to inquire concerning the penalties to which, in
the strictness of the law, the adherents of those commu∣nions
are exposed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5">
<HEAD>V. POPERY.</HEAD>
<P>THE reason why the members of the Roman Catholic
Church continue to be excepted from our common rule of
toleration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grounds of the Penal Laws against Popery.</NOTE> does not lie so much in any peculiar aversion to
the articles of their spiritual creed; as in certain relative
principles of theirs, which are attended with a plain danger
to our civil state and constitution of government. Such in
particular it is, that Popery implies the acknowledgement of
a foreign power as supereminent to the Sovereignty of these
realms; and this a power, which in its very nature is at per∣petual
war with our Sovereign, and with our whole frame and
political order of things. From this peculiarity of the doc∣trines
of Popery, which makes them matters of the most im∣portant
temporal consequence, not of conscience and specu∣lation
only, comes the singular severity with which Papists
are chastised by our laws, and distinguished from all other
non-conformists. A severity, which I shall not attempt to
vindicate from the charge of being excessive in some points;
but which we shall not be disposed to think so wonderful, if
we reflect on the long contest between the two religions, the
restlessness of the Papists under the new establishment, and
the many attacks which it underwent from them, and with
much difficulty withstood.</P>
<P><PB N="536" REF="537"/>
I HAD formerly occasion to mention, that the following
offences even amount to treason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penal Laws against Papists.</NOTE> viz. to be reconciled to
the Pope or See of Rome; to defend the Pope's jurisdiction
in this realm, if a person be twice convicted thereof; or for
a Popish priest, born within the dominions of the Crown,
to come over hither from beyond seas, or to tarry here three
days, without conforming to the Church. But farther, any
professed Jesuit or seminary priest, apprehended within this
realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1587, c. 24. 1594, c. 196. 1607, c. 1. 1609, c. 5.</NOTE> is punishable with death; which pain may also be in∣flicted
upon all wilful hearers of mass and concealers of
the same. As to the saying of mass, which was capital in
the third offence, by 1567, c. 5.; this, by several statutes, was
raised to the degree of treason.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1592, c. 122. 1607, c. 1. 1661, c. 8.</NOTE> And though this provision
has since been altered, in consequence of the new system of
treason law; yet as a capital crime, it still retains its place
in our code. Hence, as late as the 11th March 1775<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Having heard this petition, and considered the same, particularly the war∣rand of commitment, mentioning the petitioner's own declaration, and where∣in he owns his saying mass; find they cannot admit the petitioner to bail, as it seems the Lord Advocate, or his deputes, don't consent thereto, and that the saying mass is by law capital.”</NOTE>, the
petition of Alexander Macdonald for bail was refused, on
the ground that the saying of mass, which is confessed in the
petition, is not within the privilege of that relief. Besides,
by a great variety of laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1587, c. 24. 1592, c. 122. 1600, c. 18. 1700, c. 3.</NOTE> the importing, vending, or dis∣persing
of Popish books; the endeavouring to persuade any
person to decline from the true faith; the resetting of any
Jesuit, seminary-priest, or trafficking Papist, (which last also
was treason at one time); all these things are punishable
with fine, banishment, or escheat of moveables; and rewards
are offered to such as shall inform against the delinquents.</P>
<P><PB N="537" REF="538"/>
LAST of all; instead of being done away by any later re∣gulation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Summary Mode of convicting a Popish Priest.</NOTE>
the whole penal laws against Popery and Papists,
are ratified and revived by the act 1700, c. 3.; which, in
addition to them, and the better to meet “the malice and
subtilety of the said Jesuit priests and trafficking Papists,”
introduces a new and more compendious way of proving
their faith, and convicting them of the error of Popery. In
terms of this act, if any person shall labour under the re∣pute
of being a Jesuit priest or trafficking Papist; or shall
be proved to have changed his name or surname; and, in
either of these cases, if, being called on to purge himself of the
suspicion of Popery, according to a precise form prescribed
in the statute, he shall refuse so to do; this shall be a suffi∣cient
warrant to the Privy Council, (and now under the act
12. Anne, c. 14. to the Lords of Justiciary), for banishing
him forth of the realm, never to return under pain of death;
which return being proved, (he being still a Papist), shall be
a sufficient ground of capital sentence, in like manner as if
he had been convicted of the actual saying of mass, upon
any of the statutes which annex the punishment of death to
that offence.</P>
<P>THESE provisions have given occasion to a new and singular
form of criminal indictment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of Process for that purpose.</NOTE> Where or how the <HI>formula</HI>
shall be tendered, the statute has not indeed directed; but
the most regular and authentic way is in the course of the
trial, and before the assize who are to judge of the refusal: be∣cause,
though the pannel have formerly refused the <HI>formula,</HI>
yet if he will now comply and abjure, he is not within the
meaning of the act, nor in the possibility of conviction.
This course was accordingly followed in the trial of Hugh
Macdonald;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 5. Feb. 2. Mar. 1. 1756.</NOTE> for which purpose the libel, (very unlike in
<PB N="538" REF="539"/>
this to the form that is used in any other case), bore refe∣rence
to a refusal which had not yet taken place, but was
expected only to happen after impannelling the jury<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“All or part of which, together with your refusing to purge yourself of Popery, by taking the <HI>formula</HI> prescribbed by and annexed to the third act of the, &amp;c. … when the said <HI>formula</HI> shall be tendered to you by any of the Judges of the Court of Justiciary, before whom you are to be tried, being found proven by the verdict of an assize before the Lord Justice Gene∣ral, &amp;c. …. you ought to be banished forth of this realm, with certifica∣tion that if ever you return thereto, being still a Papist, you shall be punished with the pain of death.”</NOTE>. The
<HI>formula</HI> was accordingly tendered to the pannel and refused;
and upon a verdict finding the repute and the refusal proved,
he had sentence in terms of the statute. In the prior case
of Robert Maitland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 4. 1751.</NOTE> who had the like sentence upon his
own free confession of his state and faith, the libel is not in
so good a form; for it erroneously supposes the verdict of
assize to go to the repute only of the man, and not to
the refusal of the <HI>formula.</HI> Prior to either of these, there is
a libel against John Wallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 23. 1722.</NOTE> which relates the pannel's re∣fusal
of the <HI>formula</HI> when tendered by the Magistrates of a
burgh; but this charge was only followed with a fugitation.
I have observed but one instance more, of sentence proceed∣ing
upon the statute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25. 1755.</NOTE> and this is against Alexander Macdo∣nald;
who is banished under certification of death, upon his
own petition, which admits that he is habite and repute a
Papist, and does not contain any offer to abjure.</P>
<P>To make the certification of death apply to the banished
person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Can he be exe∣cuted on return, without farther Trial?</NOTE> he must not only return, but return as he went, a Papist;
for in this lies the only reason of forbidding him to enter
the country. Hence it seems to follow, that, in case of his
return, the Court cannot straightway, upon view of the man's
<PB N="539" REF="540"/>
person and proof of his identity, give warrant for his exe∣cution.
On the contrary, these facts must be made the
ground of a new process, and a second conviction by the ver∣dict
of an assize: because this is not a pure question of identi∣ty,
or concerning the execution of a former sentence; but a
question concerning a fresh and additional transgression. The
original sentence of <HI>banishment</HI> is a qualified and conditional
sentence, for as long a time only as the pannel shall continue
a Papist; and it does not, like an ordinary sentence of ba∣nishment,
bear a warrant annexed to it, for carrying the cer∣tification
into effect; but only mentions, declaratively, what
the consequence shall be in a certain event. It is, therefore,
a new inquiry, and matter of proof upon the pannel's re∣turn,
whether or not he be still a Papist, and involved in
the farther guilt which exposes him to the capital sanc∣tion;
and on the verdict to that effect, if such be found against
him, a new sentence and warrant of execution are necessary
to be given. Now this, <HI>like every other point of guilt,</HI> can only
be established by the verdict of an assize. Nor will it alter
the case, though it should even be granted that the presump∣tion
of law is against the pannel, that he has returned a
Papist. For, if he may remove this by now taking the <HI>for∣mula,</HI>
which he certainly may; there seems to be the same
reason as in the original trial, for tendering it in presence
of an assize. But this is a point which has never yet been
tried. Thus much with respect to the <HI>members of the Church
of Rome.</HI></P>

<PB N="540" REF="541"/>
<HEAD>VI. OFFENCES BY EPISCOPALS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to those of the Episcopal persuasion. It has
been hinted, that there were reasons in the principles and
attachments of many of this communion, why the indul∣gence
granted them should be guarded with due provisions for
the security of the State, and the civil Government of the
land. The statute 10. Anne, c. 7. requires, accordingly, sun∣dry
equitable compliances on the part of the Episcopal con∣gregations,
and their pastors; without which they are not en∣titled
to the benefit of the toleration, and are liable to cer∣tain
penalties, if they shall meet for divine worship.</P>
<P>THE first condition is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of proper Letters of Or∣ders; duly Re∣gistered.</NOTE> that the pastor have letters of orders
from a Protestant bishop, or, according to the later statute 19.
Geo. II. c. 38. from some bishop of the Church of England,
or of Ireland; and which letters shall be produced to the
Justices of Peace for the county or burgh, at their general
or quarter-sessions, and be there entered on record. The sta∣tute
of Anne has not, however, assigned any penalty in case of
contravention in this particular. On which account, in the
several cases of George Fairly and others, January 6. 1718;
Oughterlony and Duguid, January 20. and 31. 1718; Daniel
Taylor and others, June 18. 1716; this part of the charge
was found relevant only to debar them from the exercise of

the registration of any orders which are not from an Eng∣lish
or Irish bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">EPISCOPAL MEETINGS.</NOTE> is declared to be null; and thus the
pastor becomes liable to the penalties appointed by that act
for officiating without registration of the orders; that is,
six months imprisonment for the first offence, and for the
second, transportation for life.</P>
<P>THE second condition by the act of Anne is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omission to take the Oaths to Government.</NOTE> that the pas∣tor
have taken the oaths of allegiance and abjuration. And of
his compliance in this particular, the said act of George II.
requires him to take out a certificate from the proper officer,
(which certificate must also bear a description of his meet∣inghouse);
and to present it to the clerk of the county or
burgh, to be by him entered on record. In case of failure
to take the oaths, he is liable by the act of Anne, and the
statutes there referred to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Will. III. c. 6.</NOTE> to a fine of L. 500, and to be decla∣red
incapable of his office;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Anne, c. 14. Feb. 6. 1718.</NOTE> both which penalties were ac∣cordingly
decreed against Alexander Robertson, and five per∣sons
more. This, however, seems to be altered by the said
act of George II. which, in the case of failure to take the oaths,
or to record the certificate, inflicts the same high pains as
in the case of failure to record the orders; and authorises
Sheriffs and the Magistrates of burghs to shut up the doors of
such meetinghouse, not again to be opened until surety be
given by the owner or occupier, that the house shall not be
farther employed in the same unlawful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="543"/>
A THIRD condition prescribed by the act of Anne, and
which for a time proved the occasion of more prosecutions
than either of the other two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omission to Pray for the King. 1689, c. 16.</NOTE> was, that the clergyman at
some time during the service, should pray in express words
for her Majesty Queen Anne, the Princess Sophia Electress
of Hanover, and all the Royal Family: This under penalty
of L. 20 for the first offence, and incapacity of any living
for three years, for the second. The statute 19. George II.
c. 38. in like manner requires that the King, his heirs
and successors, by name, and all the Royal Family, shall
be prayed for according to the form of the Liturgy of the
Church of England; under pain of six months imprison∣ment
for the first offence, and transportation for the second.
For a while, many subterfuges were fallen upon by the dis∣affected,
to avoid this violation of their conscience and af∣fections.
Some pastors prayed in general terms for <HI>the Royal
Family;</HI> some had a person to pray in their stead; and others
thought to cut the knot by entirely omitting to pray. But
in all these devices, the positive injunction of the statute met
them; and on the accession of the House of Hanover, many
convictions were accordingly obtained for omissions in this
particular. James Lauder and James Inglis had sentence for
the first offence, January 10. 1718; George Fairly, for the
same, January 18. 27. 1718; William Abercromby, and
others, for the second offence, June 22. 1717; and Daniel
Taylor, and nineteen others, for the first offence, June 28.
1716. The prosecutions were the more numerous at that
period, as the expressions of the act of Anne, wherein her
successor was not mentioned by name, gave ground to argue,
that the omission to pray for King George did not fall under
the provisions there made. But the act was construed to or∣der,
that the successor to the Crown should be prayed for;
<PB N="543" REF="544"/>
and it was held, that, by a proclamation which the Lords
Justices had issued on the death of Queen Anne, pointing out
the successor to the Crown, and ordering him to be prayed
for, the statute was sufficiently applied.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient which had been employed to elude
the law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is deemed a Meetinghouse.</NOTE> was to perform divine service within the pastor's
own dwellinghouse; but this could not, any more than the
others, be effectual, if there were the form of a public dis∣course,
delivered to any meeting of persons, beside the mem∣bers
of the family. It was thought, however, expedient,
to lay down a precise rule on this subject, for the direction
both of the lieges and the courts of law. Therefore, the
statute 19. George II. c. 38. declares, that every place shall
be deemed a meetinghouse, and within the meaning of the
act, where divine service is performed to more than five per∣sons
assembled; or, if it be a dwellinghouse, to more than
five beside the members of the family. Upon this clause,
John Petrie was convicted in an inferior court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 26. 1748.</NOTE> notwith∣standing
his contrivance of drawing a screen cross the room,
which concealed the congregation from his view; but
through which they heard his discourse, and made their re∣sponses.
A bill of suspension was refused.</P>
<P>BESIDE these penalties, applicable to the pastor who does
not fully comply with the law, even his hearers are, by the
said act of George II. liable to several forfeitures and civil
disabilities. But I find no instance of prosecution for any of
these in the records of the Criminal Court.</P>

<PB N="544" REF="545"/>
<HEAD>VII. INTRUSION INTO CHURCHES.</HEAD>
<P>To this detail, there may properly be subjoined some no∣tice
of another offence, which originated in the same war∣fare
of the Presbyterian and Episcopal communions, and has
commonly been styled <HI>Intrusion into Churches.</HI></P>
<P>IT never could be doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrusion made a Point of Dit∣tay by Act 1695, c. 22.</NOTE> that any violent interruption of
public worship, or any disturbance whatsoever raised in a
church, is an aggravated sort of disorder, by reason of the
time and place; and this, whether it were occasioned by the
private quarrel of two members of the congregation, or by
two clergymen and their adherents contending against each
other for possession of the building. But the proper offence
of <HI>intrusion,</HI> though it may often be attended with this sort
of indecent disturbance, is however independent of it, and
seems first to have been formed into a point of dittay by
the statute 1695, c. 22. At the Revolution, as has been
said, the Presbyterian form of worship and Church govern∣ment
had been established, as agreeable to the wishes of
the greater part of the people. In this predilection the
people were, however, far from being unanimous; and
in particular, a large proportion of the gentry and bet∣ter
ranks of people, were no less sincerely attached to the
Episcopal communion, than the lower orders were disposed
to idolize Presbytery. Now, as the establishment had more
than once been altered in the course of a century and a half;
and each party had somewhat intemperately used its advan∣tage
against the other, in which way they had contracted a
mutual and strong dislike; so it is easy to conceive, that
<PB N="545" REF="546"/>
when the Episcopal communion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">INTRUSION<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>INTO CHURCHES.</NOTE> which had been in possession
for a course of years, was now ordered to give way, (though
this was done with many circumstances of indulgence towards
such pastors of that persuasion as would conform<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See act 1689, c. 16.; 1693, c. 22.; 1695, c. 27.</NOTE>), a rea∣dy
and universal obedience was not to be expected; and
that the new ministers might stand in need of some spe∣cial
interposition of the law, to support them against the at∣tempts
of their competitors unwarrantably to interfere with
them in their office, or living, or the possession of the parish
church. In that view, as also for the no less desirable pur∣pose
of bringing things to order and regularity among the
Presbyterian clergy themselves, the statute above mentioned
was framed, which declares, “that whoever shall intrude
themselves into any church, or shall possess manse or be∣nefice,
or shall exercise any part of the ministerial func∣tion
within any parish, without an orderly call from the
heritors and eldership, and legal admission from the Pres∣bytery
within whose bounds it lies, shall be incapable of
enjoying any church or stipend, or benefice within this king∣dom,
for the space of seven years after their removal from
the church, and quitting possession of the stipend and be∣nefice
into which they intruded.”</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence not necessary to the charge of In∣trusion.</NOTE> to expose any person to these penalties, it is not ne∣cessary,
(as indeed the term of intrusion indicates), that he
have taken possession with violence or tumult. If these ac∣company
the fact, they are an aggravation, and a ground of
punishment, of themselves; but they are not essential to the
charge of <HI>intrusion,</HI> which is relevantly laid upon the bare ex∣ercise
of the pastoral functions without an orderly call and
<PB N="546" REF="547"/>
admission to the office. It was so resolved in the case of
Gideon Guthrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 18. 1715.</NOTE> where no manner of violence was libelled;
on which ground an objection was stated to the charge.</P>
<P>INDEED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclusion of the lawful Pastor is not necessary.</NOTE> it is not even requisite that the Presbyterian
pastor be interfered with, or excluded from the church.
Though the intruder perform divine service on a day
when there is to be no service by the established minister,
he is still within the purview of the act; because he assumes
the character of pastor of that parish, which is one, and
does not belong to him; and takes possession of the church,
whereof the use pertains exclusively to the established mini∣ster
and his communion. And herein it is,—in this usurpa∣tion
of a certain character, and the exercise of public functions
which have not been conferred on him,—that the scandal and
audacity of the transgression lies. In this point also the in∣terlocutor
in the case of Guthrie is a precedent<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find the said Mr Gideon Guthrie his exercising the ministerial function, or any part thereof within the paroch of Brechin, about the time lybelled, with∣out being duly qualified in terms of the Toleration Act, relevant to infer the pains and punishment contained in the 22d act, &amp;c.… entitled, Act against intruding into churches without a legal call and admission thereto.”</NOTE>; for such
was the <HI>species facti</HI> there. By the same rule, it is not even
necessary that there be an existing and lawful minister of the
church, to be dispossessed at the time. If the living be va∣cant,
and an Episcopal or other minister, without pretence
of title, take possession of the church; he is still an intrude<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into that which belongeth not to him. The case, indeed, of a
vacant church, was that in which the usurpation would most
frequently happen, and for which the enactment was chiefly
meant; as the preamble itself informs us. Sentence was
therefore passed in terms of the statute, upon Dr John
<PB N="547" REF="548"/>
Sharp and David Hedderwick, for preaching in the vacant
church of Old Machar, without a legal admission thereto<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“But finds it proven in one voice, that Mr William Black, sub-principal of the King's Colledge of Aberdeen, and Mr Alexander Fraser, regent there, pannels, did, as patrons of the said church of Old Machar, give a presentation to Dr John Sharp, Episcopal divine, to be minister of the said parish. And likewise find it proven, that the said Dr John Sharp did enter upon the pos∣session of the said church of Old Machar, and did exercise the ministerial function therein, by preaching, and reading of prayers after the form of the book of Common Prayer used in the Church of England, without a legal presen∣tation or a legal admission thereto. And farder find it proven, that Mr Da∣vid Hedderwick pannel, did exercise the ministerial function in the said parish-church of Old Machar, by preaching, and reading of prayers after the form of the book of Common Prayer used in the Church of England, without legal admission thereto.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is also clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 6. &amp; 23. 1714.</NOTE> upon the words of the statute, that it is
not by preaching only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Any Assump∣tion of the Of∣fice is sufficient.</NOTE> but by public exercise of any part of
the ministerial function, nay even by assuming possession of the
manse or benefice, that intrusion may be committed. It is
true, that those of the Episcopal communion are indulged by
the Toleration Act, with the free exercise of all the pastoral
functions; but still only in their own peculiar and registered
place of worship, in which and which alone they are forbid∣den
to be disturbed: So that if the Episcopal priest should
presume to hold a kirk-session for the parish; or take posses∣sion
of the parish church, to celebrate marriage or baptism
there; or if he should even perform the service for the burial
of the dead, within the parish church-yard, he is in the pre∣dicament
prescribed by the act: for he is substituting his own
in place of the national communion. In the cafe of Sharp,
and in that of Guthrie, a relevancy is therefore found against
<PB N="548" REF="549"/>
the pannel, on his exercising the ministerial function, “or
any part thereof.”</P>
<P>To make a relevant charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Intrusion must be pre∣donious.</NOTE> the intruder must, however,
be plainly such; one who is without any seeming pretension
to the office. For if he have a call and admission to the
cure, though irregular and liable to some objection, and
perhaps known to the person himself to be so; this will be
sufficient to defend him in a prosecution for the statutory
pains, which to one engaged in the profession of clergyman
are severe, and were only meant for the case of a plain pre∣donious
occupier of the church or living. This is illustrated
in the case of Mr William Duguid;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 16, 17, 18, 19. 1713.</NOTE> who, after having en∣tered
to preach in a certain church as probationer, by li∣cense
of the presbytery of the bounds, and after being in the
course of admission to the benefice upon call and presenta∣tion,
had in the end been deprived of his license by the Ge∣neral
Assembly; but had nevertheless persisted to preach,
under colour of some vice in the sentence of Assembly, and
the intimation thereof to him. In these circumstances, the
prosecutor found it proper judicially to pass from the statu∣tory
penalties, and limit his conclusions to the bare removal
of Mr Duguid from the church, until he should be lawfully
admitted; which was accordingly decreed upon conviction.
On the other side, the appearance at least of an order∣ly
title is requisite to the pannel's defence. And here I
again quote the case of Sharp and Hedderwick above men∣tioned,
in which, notwithstanding a presentation to Sharp
by the proper patron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 28. and July 6. &amp; 28. 1714.</NOTE> decree went against him for the sta∣tutory
penalties; he being an Episcopal divine, and ut∣terly
unqualified to hold the cure; as well as he had no pre∣tence
<PB N="549" REF="550"/>
of license or admission from the Presbytery of the
bounds<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">“Find, that the said regents or masters of the College libelled against, or any of them, who by act of Parliament are in a particular manner ordained to give submission to the church as settled by law, their having given a pre∣sentation to Dr Sharp, an Episcopal divine, contrary to their duty as patrons, and the statutes whereby patrons are ordained to present qualified ministers, relevant to inser an arbitrary punishment and expences; and find the said Doctor his having entered upon the possession of the church above mentioned, or his having exercised any part of the ministerial function therein, without a legal presentation, and also a legal admission thereto, relevant to infer the pains contained in the 22d act of Parliament 1695.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE offence of intrusion seems to have relation only to
the irregular entry or beginning of possession;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is not Intrusion, to act after De∣position.</NOTE> as indeed the
continuing to exercise the pastoral function, in disregard of
a sentence of deposition or suspension, though doubtless a
wrong, is however one of a different and an inferior kind.
This is clearly intimated by the statute itself, in that part
of it which directs the Privy Council to devise a course for
hindering ministers, “who are or shall hereafter be deposed
by the judicatories of this present established Church,
from preaching or exercising any act of their ministerial
function.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 19. 1709.</NOTE> Conformably to this view of the matter, John
Skinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2, 9. 1710.</NOTE> convicted of using the office of minister after depo∣sition,
was only ordained to lie in gaol till he should find
caution to abstain from doing so in future, and to remove
from the Presbytery where he had offended.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 27, 28. 1717.</NOTE> Alexander
Robertson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 2. 1718.</NOTE> and six others, convicted of the like offence,
were decerned to cede possession of the several manses,
kirks, glebes, &amp;c. in question, under pain of L. 10 each;
to find caution, to the extent of L. 500 merks each, not to
molest the established pastors in future; and to make pay∣ment
<PB N="550" REF="551"/>
of L. 25 of damages. Again, on the 31st January 1718,
the Court “find the said Mr Robert Thomson, his posses∣sing
and detaining the manse of Lethnot, notwithstanding
his being deposed from being minister of that parish, re∣levant
to make him liable to quit his possession thereof,
and to restore to the present incumbent of that parish.”</P>
<P>IT may here be asked, concerning those lay offenders who
assist the clergyman in his intrusion, and to whom the penal∣ties
in the statute will not so properly apply; are they there∣fore
to pass entirely unpunished? This consequence by no
means follows. If any outrage or tumult happens in ac∣complishing
the intrusion; for this, the persons concerned concerned are
of course liable to punishment, and the more by reason of the
nature of the occasion which gives rise to the disturbance.
But even if there be no violence; still all such proceedings
as naturally make a person art and part of the intrusion, are,
as a necessary consequence of the statute which creates that
offence, subject to such censure as the case shall seem to de∣serve.
And this has more than once been resolved. In the
case of Kenneth Mackenzie, and others, Magistrates of Elgin,
it was found relevant to infer an arbitrary pain, damages and
expences against the Magistrates, that they had turned out the
established minister, and put an Episcopal priest in posses∣sion
of the church; and against James Russell, that, being
entrusted with the keys of the church, he delivered up the
same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9. &amp; 24. and March 2. 1713.</NOTE> or made the church patent to the intruder. On con∣viction,
they were fined in L. 20 Sterling, and decerned to
pay L. 30 of costs. In the case also of Old Machar, Messrs
Fraser and Black, masters of King's College, Aberdeen, who,
as patrons, had given a presentation to the intruder, an Epis∣copal
divine, and an unqualified person, were found liable in
L. 50 of costs; were sent to gaol for ten days; and ordered
<PB N="551" REF="552"/>
to find caution not to trouble the Presbyterian communion
in its possession of the church and parish of Old Machar in
time to come. Certain other persons, who had aided in
breaking up the door of the church, were likewise sent to
gaol, and put under surety to the same effect.</P>
<P>IN terms of the statute 1695,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Pro∣secution for In∣trusion.</NOTE> the prosecutor for intrusion,
is the Presbytery of the bounds where the offence has been
committed; or some person in their name, and furnished
with a warrant from them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9. 1713.</NOTE> In the case of William Duguid, it
seems, however, to have been held, that the Moderator, and
two members of Presbytery, might prosecute in their name,
though not furnished with any special authority. In most
cases, along with the Presbytery, the Procurator for the
Church has appeared, as having a plain title, from the na∣ture
of his office; and in some instances he has been the sole
prosecutor, without either the authority of concurrence of
the Presbytery of the bounds.</P>
<P>UPON the words of the said act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Judge in Trial for Intrusion.</NOTE> it might seem at first
view, that the cognisance of charges for intrusion is at∣tributed
to the inferior courts, in exclusion of the Supreme.
But the true purpose of the provision there made in that be∣half,
was to declare the competency of the inferior Judges,
for the sake of speedy trial, if the prosecutor chose. It ap∣pears,
however, that in practice advantage was not taken of
this permission; for from 1709 to 1719, the records of Justi∣ciary
are full of trials for intrusion; in most of which very
keen, but tedious and uninstructive debates took place.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. SIMONY. BARRATRY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the crimes referrible to this class,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simony, if a Point of Dittay.</NOTE> Mackenzie has
placed that of Simony, or the selling or buying of a church-office.
But there is no instance of a prosecution for that
offence in the records of the Criminal Court. Neither is
there any statute which appoints a punishment for Simony, or
in which it is even set down as a crime. Indeed the only one
where mention is made of Simoniacal paction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612, c. 1.</NOTE> alludes to no
consequence but the refusal of the presentation, and remits
the cognisance of such debates to the Civil Court; nay, by
authorising the presentee to come under such engagements
with respect to the living, as are not prejudicial to his <HI>suffi∣cient
maintenance,</HI> it seems rather to protect Simony to a cer∣tain
extent, than to reprehend it.</P>
<P>BARRATRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barratry, its Meaning in our Practice.</NOTE> in the law of England, is the offence of stir∣ring
up frequent suits and quarrels among his Majesty's sub∣jects.
The term is, however, of foreign origin, and in Italy
and other countries seems ordinarily to have been applied to
the traffic of ecclesiastical benefices; but was afterwards
used in a more general sense, as applicable to all corrupt
buying and selling of justice<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">See Craig de Feudis, lib. iii. Dieg. 5. No. 15, 16.; Mackenzie's Observa∣tions on Act 38. Parl. 4▪ James IV.</NOTE>. With us it signified the cor∣rupt
purchasing of benefices, or offices of collection, from the
See of Rome, by persons who left the realm for that pur∣pose;
a practice which had become frequent, and was, in
more views than one, injurious to the realm: as a means of
<PB N="553" REF="554"/>
carrying money out of it, without any return of value; as
prejudicial to the right of patronage in the King or others,
and to the free election of the monks in the monasteries,
both which the Pope by prevention pretended to exclude;
and as contributing to raise the rate of taxation upon bene∣fices,
by the false accounts which those suitors for the office
of collector carried to the Pope.</P>
<P>IT was first forbidden by the statute 1427,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws against it.</NOTE> c. 106. under the
pains due to those who export money out of the kingdom
The act 1471, c. 43. declared that barratours should be inca∣pable
of holding benefice, or using worship within the
realm. The act 1494, c. 53. adds to these the pains of pro∣scription,
banishment, and denunciation at the horn. In
both these laws, the offenders are farther ordered to be
demeaned as traitors to the King; but as special penalties
are at the same time appointed, this was rather to be look∣ed
on as a rhetorical expression, than a part of the sanction.
Accordingly, no such term is used in the latest, and only
statute after the Reformation concerning baratry, the act
1567, c. 2. <HI>anent the abolishing the Pope and his usurped autho∣rity;</HI>
by which the lieges are forbidden, “to sute or desire
title or richt of the said Bischop of Rome, or his sect, to ony
thing within this realme under the paines of barratrie, that
is to say, proscription, banishment, and never to bruke
honour, office, nor dignitie within this realme.” In order to
secure the youth of the realm against the errors of Popery,
<HI>the pains of baratry</HI> were by 1579, c. 71. ordered to be inflicted
on the sons of noblemen, gentlemen, or others who should
pass abroad for education, without his Majesty's previous
license. As also such persons, if, within twenty days after
their return from abroad, they should not appear before the
<PB N="554" REF="555"/>
proper officer of the church there mentioned, and adhere to
the national confession of faith, were ordered to leave the
realm, within forty days more, under pain of being “admo∣nisched
and persewed as the adversaries of the saide trew
religion.”</P>

<HEAD>IX. WITCHCRAFT.</HEAD>
<P>WE cannot properly close this catalogue of offences against
God and religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Authorities for the Belief of Witchcraft.</NOTE> without adding a few words respecting one
which unhappily occupies a very large portion of our Cri∣minal
records, the crime of sorcery, or witchcraft; which
consisted in holding communion with the grand enemy of
mankind, or with evil spirits. This, in the sight of those
who believed in such an intercourse, was of course one
of the most abominable offences of the high class of which
we are now treating; since, according to the common no∣tions
of it, it implied a renunciation of baptism, and Chri∣stianity,
and of God Almighty; an acknowledgment of the
devil for sovereign and master in his stead; and an upgiving
of the servant's soul and body into the power and disposal
of Satan; all of them acts of the most horrid wickedness
and impiety. Besides, this compact was supposed to be com∣monly
entered into, for the purpose of acquiring preter∣natural
powers, which were to be used by the pupil for pur∣poses
of mischief and revenge. If real, it was thus, in every
point of view, a monstrous and fearful offence, and the sit
subject of the most exemplary vengeance that could be ap∣plied
to it. And that it was no illusion, but a possible, real,
and frequent crime, our ancestors were not singular in be∣lieving;
but had to countenance them in that opinion, the
<PB N="555" REF="556"/>
law and ordinary custom of all the nations of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">WITCHCRAFT.</NOTE> without
exception even of those which were held to be most enlighten∣ed.
These appealed, too, in support of their practice, to certain
passages of the Holy Scriptures, which were alleged to coun∣tenance
the belief of such a thing; as also to the example of
the Roman law<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cod. lib. 9. tit. 18. 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. 7. 8.</NOTE>, which spoke of the <HI>ars mathematica</HI> as “<HI>dam∣nabilis

therein, of all descriptions, to die by fire, as enemies
of the human race; as well as it punished with death, all
who should consult any magician or soothsayer, or attempt
to learn the art of divination, &amp;c. “<HI>Sileat</HI> (says the Em∣peror
Constantine) <HI>omnibus perpetuo divinandi curiositas. Ete∣nim

<P>THE lawyers of foreign countries had accordingly bestow∣ed
no little pains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots Statute punished it with Death.</NOTE> in a thorough analysis of this dreaded im∣piety;
separating the different classes of wizards and necro∣mancers,
(of which <HI>Carpsovius</HI> enumerates six); investigating
the <HI>indicia</HI> of the guilt; and devising the rules of evidence
and trial, that might be most suitable to each kind of mali∣fice
and enchantment: In all which inquiries, much subtle∣ty
is employed, and even great precision attempted to be
attained. No wonder then, that in this ruder and more ig∣norant
corner of the world, so popular a superstition found an
easy and universal reception, not only with the lower ranks,
but with the Legislature of the country. There is but one
statute on the subject, the act 1563, c. 73. which appoints the
pain of death to be executed as well upon the seeker or em∣ployer
as the user of sorcery; and seems to have been equal∣ly
<PB N="556" REF="557"/>
calculated for the case of him who was really an adept in
the craft, and of him who falsely pretended to possess it.
There seems, however, to have been little need of any provi∣sion
conceived in such extensive terms. For among the many
trials for witchcraft which sill the record, I have not ob∣served
that there is even one which proceeds upon the no∣tion
of a vain or cheating art, falsely used by an impostor
to deceive the weak and credulous. In all of them, there is
either a charge of preternatural powers acquired by the
seeker of sorcery; or at least a charge of actual communi∣cation
with Satan and other evil spirits; and this stated in
such a manner as bears evidence of a full assent to the essi∣cacy
of those impious practices, and marks the horror which
was felt of the irresistible and dreadful dominion that might
be gained and conferred in this way of intercourse.</P>
<P>I DO not intend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Detail of the Law unne∣cessary.</NOTE> (it would be of no use, and surely it
could not be amusing), to enter into a detail of the law in
this melancholy and humiliating article; which unhappily
is one of the longest, the most laboured, and the fullest of
adjudged cases, of any in the whole circuit of our Criminal
practice. Mackenzie, in that chapter of his treatise which re∣lates
to witchcraft, has given us sufficient information of mi∣serable
consequences of this strange delusion; and of the vain
and ineffectual precautions by which our Judges attempted
to guard themselves against error or precipitancy, in a mat∣ter
where even they, believing as they did in the reality of
the crime, saw, however, that they had to tread upon so
foul and treacherous a bottom. Those who are desirous of
a still fuller knowledge of this afflicting sort of history, may
have recourse to the volume of reports by Mr Arnot; who has
<PB N="557" REF="558"/>
been at pains in collecting some of the most noted and ex∣traordinary
trials.</P>
<P>SUFFICE it to say in general, (without engaging in the re∣lation
of the sufferings of helpless and inoffensive creatures),
that it cannot surprise us if men lost all sight of reason, and
of the ordinary rules of justice, in the execution of a part of
the law which was founded altogether upon ignorance and
terror.</P>
<P>IT would have been dangerous enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Received Grounds of Witchcraft.</NOTE> if the charge of
witchcraft had even been confined to those situations of vi∣sible
mischief or calamity, whereof the circumstances might
serve as grounds of inquiry, and in some, though an improper
sense, as a <HI>corpus delicti</HI> in the case. But no such limitation
was received into practice. It was not only to account for
strange events, or such as were out of the ordinary course of na∣ture,
and which might move the fears and passions of men,
that this supernatural agency was resorted to: Neither was it
only called in aid on occasion of rare and uncommon casual∣ties,
such as the burning of a man's house, or the wreck of his
ship at sea; or on occasion of those events, such as loss of
health, or failure of credit, which though familiar, are, how∣ever,
distressing to those concerned. Every thing that cros∣sed
a person in his pursuits, or that did not happen according
to his wishes, was held equally relevant: As, for instance,
that such a man's boat caught no fish, when other boats were
successful; or that such a woman's corn yielded less meal,
or her cows gave less milk, than those of her neighbours.
They stopped not even here, with <HI>indicia</HI> like these, which,
were at least tangible facts, and capable of being ascertain∣ed
in the way of ordinary proof; but also received the
charge of witchcraft, and even more frequently than other∣wise,
upon such grounds as had never been exhibited in any
<PB N="558" REF="559"/>
outward or palpable occurrence at all; and only for the first
time came to light, by the confession of the pannel and
his associates as to their intercourse with the other world.
Thus the following were all undoubted articles of dittay:
To enter into a paction with the devil to serve him; to call
him up and confer with him; to be baptized by him, or re∣ceive
his gifts; as also, which was often charged, and some∣times
found proved, to join with him in carnal copulation.
It would be tedious to recount the numerous instances of
these and the like crazy dreams and revelations, which were
propagated and believed so much the more greedily, in pro∣portion
as they were extravagant and absurd.</P>
<P>SUCH as was the substance of the charge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of Inquiry as to Witchcraft.</NOTE> such also was the
procedure against the abhorred offender, and the proofs ad∣mitted
to substantiate his guilt; in both of which all sight
was lost, not only of all ordinary rules, but of humanity and
common sense. The taking inquisition concerning witchcraft
was not confined to Magistrates and Judges, who might be sup∣posed
somewhat more competent to such investigations; but
was given, at least was permitted, almost to all persons in any
sort of authority, and especially to clergymen and kirk-sessions;
who seem to have proceeded upon common fame, or other
the like loose ground, and before whom, in particular, most
of the many fatal confessions that were made by the accu∣sed,
seem to have been obtained. Also, the ordinary judi∣catures
were set aside, even as to the trial of the crime.
For though it was held that the inferior judges were not
competent to the conducting of so nice an inquiry, the ac∣cused
had truly no advantage in this rule: on the contrary he
<PB N="559" REF="560"/>
was so much the more hardly dealt with; as the trial in con∣sequence
was often delegated to Commissioners who were
named by the Privy Council, and were not uncommonly
taken from among the gentry of the parts where the <HI>fame</HI>
of the witchcraft had arisen. No fewer than fourteen com∣missions
for trial of witches were granted for different quar∣ters
of the country, in one sederunt of the 7th of November
1661; which year seems to have been the most fertile period
of this sort of accusation.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the circumstances of evidence which were
held to be relevant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Competent Evi∣dence in the Trial.</NOTE> or the competent ways of proving those
circumstances; it may truly be said, that scarce any settled
distinction was observed. If the pannel had uttered threats
against the accuser; one could not much wonder that this
was held to be an ingredient of suspicion. Or, if a person were
found making use of charms and ceremonies; it was still
less to be admired, that this was sustained as undoubted evi∣dence
of guilt. But the instances are frequent of the like con∣clusion
being drawn from circumstances, either quite trifling
and accidental, or which seem to have no peculiar connection
with the events that are attributed to them in the libel. As
for instance, that a person was taken ill, or became well, (for
that made no manner of difference), soon after speaking to, or
touching the pannel, or upon her passing the house, or co∣ming
into the neighbourhood. There was, indeed, hardly
any thing so familiar, upon which suspicion did not fasten. If
a woman prospered in the world more than her neighbours
saw cause for, or perhaps wished; or if she kept her health
in a sickly season; or were not to be found at any time when
she was sought for; it behoved her, by the rules of this
<PB N="560" REF="561"/>
code, to be in company with the devil, and to be one of his
servants. Along with other means, use was made of presump∣tions,
drawn from certain marks upon the body, or from the
possession of certain things or implements, which, how ordi∣nary
soever the nature and use of them, were agreed to be the
gifts of the devil, or symptoms of witchcraft: or the accused
was subjected to certain summary experiments, as by throw∣ing
into water with the hands and feet bound, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof by Con∣fession of Party.</NOTE> strange as it may appear, the prime and the ordina∣ry
mode of evidence, was that which in common cases is the
best of any; but which in this had not the same advantage,
both by reason of the nature of the crime, as to which a
crazy imagination might quite impose on the accused; and
still more by reason of the shameful and cruel means, which
seem to have been too commonly employed to obtain it: I
mean the canfession of party. Torture, of one kind or
other, seems to have been freely made use of. The most
common mode of it was the thrusting of pins into the body,
and the denial of sleep for many successive days and nights;
both of which expedients, as far as I can judge, were often
employed, not as in other cases, under the special direction
of the Justiciary or Privy Council, but at the discretion of
the Commission, or other judicature, not excepting mini∣sters
and kirk-sessions, who took charge of the preparatory
inquisition. The art of conducting this sort of <HI>quaestion</HI> was
indeed so common a thing, and in such request, that the
knowledge of it even became a trade<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, vol. i. p. 16. reports the complaint of Catharine Liddell against Rutherford, a baron-baillie, who had imprisoned her as a witch, and against Da∣vid Cowan, who, under his authority, had tortured her with long pins thrust in∣to several parts of her body. Cowan defends himself upon the lawfulness of his trade, and the truth of his art; in which he says he had been instructed by “Kineaid, a famed pricker.”</NOTE>, by which men were
<PB N="561" REF="562"/>
described, and earned a livelihood. Other and more se∣vere
tortures were, however, on some occasions employed.
Monstrous as the thing is, the allegation is upon record,
that in one instance at least,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24. 1596.</NOTE> (the case of Alison Balfour), the
torture was not confined to the accused herself; but was ap∣plied
in her presence to her husband, and her son, and her
daughter, a child of seven years old, to force her to confess.</P>
<P>ALL these things duly considered; the present misery;
the long consinement; the small hope of acquittal; the risk
of a new charge and prosecution; and the certain loss of all
comfort and connection in society; there will be less reason to
wonder at the numerous convictions of witchcraft which were
obtained on the confession of party. Add to these causes,
though of themselves sufficient, the influence of another, as
powerful perhaps as any of them; the unsound and crazy state
of imagination in many of these unhappy victims themselves.
In those times, when all the inhabitants of this country, with∣out
exception even of the most intelligent, were thoroughly
persuaded of the truth of witchcraft, and of the possibility
of acquiring preternatural powers, it seems nowise impro∣bable
that individuals would sometimes be found, who, ei∣ther
seeking to indulge their malice, or stimulated by cu∣riosity
and an irregular imagination, did actually court and
solicit a communication with evil spirits, by the means
which in those days were reputed to be effectual for such a
purpose. And it is possible, that among these there might be
some, who, in the course of long and earnest employment
in such a pursuit, came at last to be far enough disordered,
<PB N="562" REF="563"/>
to mistake their own dreams and ravings, or hysteric affec∣tions,
for the actual interviews and impressions of Satan.</P>
<P>I WILL not enlarge farther on so disagreeable a sub∣ject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosecution for Witchcraft for∣bidden by Sta∣tute.</NOTE>
The crime itself was cast out of the law, by the sta∣tute
of the 9. of Geo. II. c. 5. which discharges all pro∣secutions
for witchcraft, or for imputing witchcraft to an∣other
person; in as much as this is now to be held an ab∣surd
and incredible imputation, by which no person can be
injured in point of same. The statute also provides, that any
one who shall pretend, from his skill in any occult or crafty
science, to discover where lost or stolen goods are, or how
they may be recovered, shall, as a cheat and impostor, suffer
imprisonment for a year, and in that space stand four times
on the pillory.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LORD ROYSTON's NOTE
ON THE
CASE of Mrs NISBET<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Referred to vol. i. p. 241.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FALSEHOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Expressly to condemn,</HI> &amp;c. This opinion was so gene∣rally
taken to be good law, that when in a late case it was
called in question, it was look't on as a novelty, and a
singular opinion against a received and fix't rule in law.
However, if we examine it, it will be found to be without
foundation, or good authority. The first time it was called
in question was in Margaret Nisbet's case, July 1726, who
was found, upon a complaint exhibit against her at the in∣stance
of one Henderson, with concourse of the Lord Ad∣vocate,
to have forged a bill for L. 58 Sterling, said to be
drawn by said Henderson, and accepted by the Dutches
of Gordon, and indorsed by him to Margaret Nisbet; and
to have forged a declaration by said Henderson, by which
he acknowledged that he had truely indorsed said bill; all
which was made appear to have been contrived by her, by
inducing one Husband <HI>alias</HI> Cameron to personate and assume
Henderson's name, and sign the declaration before witnesses.
When it came to be advised, the question was, Whether she
<PB N="575" REF="576"/>
should be punished arbitrary by the Lords, or remitted to
the Justiciary; some out of compassion to her sex, and that
the bill was never made use of in judgment or abidden by,
were for the milder sentence; others, because of the artfull
contrivance and atrocity of the forgery, by which an in∣nocent
person was put in hazard of his life, by being very
near found guilty of the forgery, thought she justly deser∣ved
the highest punishment. To reconcile these two opi∣nions,
I said, that it appeared that those who inclined most
to favour her were of opinion she deserved the highest ar∣bitrary
punishment, even such as could not be inflicted by
any civil Judge, such as amputation of a member, which
was an ordinary punishment for this crime by the practice
of nations: That therefore I was of opinion she should be
remitted to the Justiciary. To this it was said, that in this
case the Justiciary were tied down to punish her with death,
and cited this passage for support of this opinion. To this
I answered, that though I had great respect for the opinion
of that eminent lawyer; yet I could not in this agree with
him, unless it could be made appear that it was supported
either by express statute or precedents, neither of which did
appear to me. Nor is it easy to conceive that any law would
tye down one Sovereign Court implicitly to follow the opi∣nion
of a co-ordinate judicature, especially in a question
that properly belonged to their own cognisance, and to leave
them no other power than to pronounce sentence of death.
This is not to give them a power to act as judges, but as
executioners; an office very unbecoming the dignity of a
Sovereign Court. Especially in this crime of falsehood,
which has no fix't or determined punishment, but is greater
or less according to the degree of the crime, and, as the
<PB N="576" REF="577"/>
civil law terms it, <HI>pro modo admissi,</HI> nor does any of our acts of
Parliament once mention the pain of death, but refers to the
punishment by the laws, civil and canon; by which first
law it was arbitrary, and the pain of death seldom inflicted,
but on <HI>personae viles,</HI> as I have noticed on another place of
this title; so that it is plain death is not the <HI>paena ordinaria</HI>
of this crime, but rather indeed <HI>extraordinaria.</HI> Two things
I apprehend have given rise to this opinion. The first is, that
it was thought the Justiciary could not judge this crime <HI>in pri∣ma
instantia,</HI> and so says our author, § 4. <HI>h. t.;</HI> but this is a
mistake, nor does the decision in Macculloch's case, which he
cites, support it, as will appear by looking into it. On the
contrary, there are several decisions of late where the com∣potency
of the Court <HI>in prima instantia</HI> being objected to,
it was expressly over-ruled and repelled, of which I have
given instances in <HI>Obs. ad d. par.</HI> 4. The second thing that
seemed to support this opinion is, that there were no instan∣ces
where the Justices inflicted a lesser punishment than
death in the case of such remitts; and though this were true
in fact, it does not conclude; for it may be, that all who
were remitted to them were so atrocious as justly to deserve
that punishment. But neither does it hold in fact, there being
many instances on record where arbitrary punishments were
inflicted; of which I shall give some, as Croy, 15th March
1605, for being a false witness, only scourged. <HI>It.</HI> 28th ditto,
Strachan a messenger, for giving several false executions and
denunciations, was only deposed and whipped. <HI>It.</HI> 4th July
1638, Forsyth a notary, for forging a charter, was set on the
Cross and banished. <HI>It.</HI> 27th February 1650, Lawson and
Blair, two nottars, for forging a discharge and remit by the
Session to the Justices, to be judged according to law;
Lawson was only declared infamous, his ear nailed to the
<PB N="577" REF="578"/>
Trone, and banished; and as to Blair, the Justices petitioned
the Parliament to have their opinion what punishment to
inflict on him, who gave their opinion he should be hanged;
which sentence was accordingly pronounced. These instan∣ces
fully make it appear, that the Justices did not think
themselves tyed down to pronounce sentence of death on
every one who was remit to them for falsehood by the Ses∣sion.</P>
<P>Mrs Nisbet having been remit to the Justiciary, the King's
lawyers did not insist on the argument that the indytement
should be found relevant to infer the pain of death, because
it was remitted; but because of the atrocity of the crime.
But the pannell's lawyers did inform upon it. The Lords,
at advising, were of opinion, that they were not tyed down
by the remit, but were absolutely at liberty to inflict what
punishment they judged the crime deserved. But because it
was not pled by the prosecutors, no notice is taken of it in
the interlocutor; however she was sentenced to be hanged,
<HI>et merito.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding what the author says here in page 195.
<HI>inf.</HI> he says, that the Session in their remit qualify the decree
of the punishment they are to inflict, as scourging, &amp;c. ac∣cording
to the degree of the guilt; which is more reasonable
than what he here asserts, that in all remitts they must con∣demn
to death, without distinction of the degree of the
guilt.</P>

<P>Thereafter, the Sheriff-depute of Air and Wigton were
called, and it being asked, if there was any in Court who
had any complaints to make against the Sheriff-deputes; Mr
John Crawfoord of Jordanhill, Advocate-depute, represent∣ed,
that there was a decreet in the clerk's hands against Wil∣liam
Colville of Nether Eriff, pronounced by the Sheriff de∣pute
of Air, at the instance of his fiscal, and craved the clerk
might be ordained to read: which being accordingly done,
the Advocate-depute did allege that the said decreet was
most unwarrantable, and the said Sheriff depute's procedure
against the said William Colville, oppressive and illegal; in
as far as the said William Colville's goods were rouped and
sold by the said Sheriff-depute's warrand, before any trial,
conviction or fugitation: though thereafter there was a sham
process pursued at the instance of the procurator-fiscal against
the said William Colville, yet all done thereupon being in
absence, he is decerned to pay to him one hundred and fifty
pounds Scots; whereas nothing could be done save the fugi∣tating
of the said Colville, he not compearing, which was
clearly instructed by the extract produced under the Sheriff-clerk's
hands.</P>
<P>Thereafter, the said William Ferguson of Auchinblain
being ordered to the pannell, and being publicly and judi∣cially
interrogate, whether or not the facts contained in the

said extracted decreet presently read were all true; and if
every thing was so transacted as was mentioned in the said
extract, to which the said William Ferguson answered, that
they were all true, and that it was the custome of the coun∣try,
and of other Sheriffs so to do.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners of Justiciary having considered
the above complaint, with the extract of the decreet produ∣ced,
and Auchinblain's judicial acknowledgement, they in

pounds Scots, the one half thereof to be paid to John Grier∣son,
macer of Court, and the other half to be paid to James

betwixt them: As also, ordaine him to consign in the clerk
of Court's hands, the sum of one hundred and sixty-eight
pounds Scots money, as the prices of the said William Col∣ville's
goods intromitted with by him, to be made furthco∣ming
by the clerk of Court unto the parties having best

by him against the delinquents contained in said Por∣teous-roll
at their respective dwelling houses; but, as is to be

trial of the delinquents), neglect to execute the said roll at the

untill the nineteenth of said April, after which they had not

<SPEAKER>Eskgrove.</SPEAKER>
<P>The alternate charge of murder or culpable
homicide, not customary till of late. Is an improvement.
Libel is relevant in both charges. I think the facts, <HI>if proved
as charged,</HI> infer murder. Instrument in itself deadly—point∣ed
up a public lane—fired there in day-time—firing at a
multitude is murder;—though there be no special enmity at
any one. If the pannel's state of facts be proved, it will only
reduce the guilt to culpable homicide: It was found so in a
case tried before me at Stirling, where the gun was only
<HI>wadded,</HI> and the wadding killed.</P>

<PB N="582" REF="583"/>

<P>Where there is an <HI>animus injuriandi,</HI> though not

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice-Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be murder without malice or
special enmity at a certain person. Wilfully to fire a load∣ed
gun in the streets of a burgh in the day-time, that is mur∣der.
If it be proved that the pannel loaded, as he thought,
with powder only, still the homicide will be culpable; for it
was a great fault to fire there at all, considering the risk of
accidents. So I am for finding the <HI>murder</HI> libelled relevant
to infer death, and the culpable <HI>homicide</HI> relevant to infer an
arbitrary pain; and allow a proof, &amp;c.</P>
