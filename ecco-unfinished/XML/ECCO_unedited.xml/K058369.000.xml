<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NO</HI> Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults, but
he that has none of his own, <HI>say some People, who
are loth to be told of their Errors;</HI> and 'tis on this Ac∣count
only, that the World has the Trouble of a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>If that be true, the Author freely acknowledges he is the
most unqualified Man in the World to reprove.</P>
<P>That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes,
who allows himself in the Practice of the same, is very rea∣dity
granted, and is the very Substance and Foundation of
the following <HI>Satyr:</HI> And on that score, the Author has as
good a Title to Animadversion as another, since no Man can
charge him with any of the Vices he has reprov'd.</P>
<P>But instead of Self-defence, he is rather willing to
look back on the best Actions of his Life, with the Temper
of a Penitent, and he wishes all Men won'd do the like; 'tis
the onely way to make the <HI>Satyr</HI> Impertiment.</P>
<Q><L>For Penitence would all his Verse disarm,</L>
<L>The <HI>Satyr</HI>'s answer'd if the Men reform.</L></Q>
<P>But the Fact is not true neither: 'Tis a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity way for
Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition. If none
but faultless Men must reprove others, the Lord h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mercy
upon all our Magistrates; and all our Clergy are undigni∣fied
and suspended at a Blow.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
Nor does the <HI>Satyr</HI> assault private Infirmity, or pursue
Personal Vices; but is bent at those, who pretending to sup∣press
Vice, or being vested with Authority for that purpose,
yet make themselves the Shame of their Country, encouraging
Wic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dness by that very Authority they have to suppress it.</P>
<P>He professes himself sorry, either that Freedom of Speech
is so dangerous in this Age, or that he is too much a Cow∣ard
otherwise, some had heard of their Crimes who think
themselves above the Power of Punishment.</P>
<P>'Tis hard that Vice should have so much shelter from Ci∣vil
Power, that Reproof should lead the Party to suppress the
Poet rather than the Crime.</P>
<P>And yet his Friends give him over for lost: An Account
of what he has ventur'd to say, to whose Importunity he thinks
himself oblig'd to answer with <HI>Juvenal,</HI>
<Q><L>Difficile est Satyram non scribere. Nam quis Iniquae.</L>
<L>Tam Patiens Urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?</L></Q></P>
<P>If any Man is injur'd by the Characters, he is content
they should carry their Resentment to what Extremity they
please; but if Truth may be on his side, the only way to make
him do them Justice is to reform: And he promises to give
Testimony to their Repentance, <HI>as an Amand Honourable,</HI>
in a manner as publick as possible.</P>

<LG>
<L>HOW long may Heaven be banter'd by a Nation,</L>
<L>With broken Vows, and Shams of Reformation,</L>
<L>And yet forbear to show its Indignation?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell me ye Sages, who the Conscience guide,</L>
<L>And Ecclesiastick Oracle divide,</L>
<L>Where do the Bounds of Sovereign Patience end,</L>
<L>How long may People undestry'd offend?</L>
<L>What Limits has Almighty Power prepar'd,</L>
<L>When Mercy shall be deaf and Justice heard?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<L>If there's a Being Immortal and Immense,</L>
<L>Who does Rewards and Punishments dispense,</L>
<L>Why is he Passive when his Power's defy'd,</L>
<L>And his Eternal Government's deny'd?</L>
<L>Tell us why he that sits above the Sky,</L>
<L>Unreins no Vengeance, lets no Thunders fly,</L>
<L>When Villains prosper, and successful Vice,</L>
<L>Shall human Power controul and Heavenly Power despise?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If 'tis because the Sins of such a Nation,</L>
<L>Are yet too small to conquer his Compassion,</L>
<L>Then tell us to what height Mankind may sin,</L>
<L>Before Celestial Fury must begin?</L>
<L>How their extended Crimes may reach so high,</L>
<L>Vengeance must follow and of course destroy;</L>
<L>And by the common Chain of Providence,</L>
<L>Destruction come like Cause and Consequence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then search the dark <HI>Arcana</HI> of the Skies,</L>
<L>And <HI>if ye can,</HI> unfold these Mysteries:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
His clashing Providences reconcile</L>
<L>The partial Frown, and the unequal Smile.</L>
<L>Tell us why some have been destroy'd betimes,</L>
<L>While <HI>Albion</HI>'s glittering Shores grow black with Crimes?</L>
<L>Why some for early Errors are undone,</L>
<L>Some <HI>longer still, and longer</HI> still sin on?</L>
<L><HI>England</HI> with all her blackening Guilt is spar'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sodom</HI>'s lesser Crimes receiv'd a swift Reward:</L>
<L>And yet all this be reconcil'd to both,</L>
<L>Impartial Justice, and unnerring Truth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why <HI>Ostia</HI> stands, and no revenging hand</L>
<L>Has yet dismist her from the burthen'd Land;</L>
<L>No Plague, no sulphurous Shower her <HI>exit</HI> makes,</L>
<L>And turns her Silver <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Stygian</HI> Lakes,</L>
<L>Whose so uninhabitable Banks might flow</L>
<L>With Streams as black as her that made 'em so:</L>
<L>And as a Monument to future Times,</L>
<L>Should send forth Vapours nauseous as her Crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell us why <HI>Carthage</HI> fell a Prey to <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>And mourn the Fate of bright <HI>Byzantium.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Why ancient <HI>Troy</HI>'s embrac'd by Destiny,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rome,</HI> Immortal <HI>Rome,</HI> to Fate gives way,</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Ostia</HI> stands, more impious far than they?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where are the Golden Gates of <HI>Palestine,</HI></L>
<L>Where High Superiour Glory us'd to shine?</L>
<L>The mighty City Millions dwelt within,</L>
<L>Where Heaven's Epitome was to be seen.</L>
<L>God's Habitation, sacred to his Name,</L>
<L>Magnificent beyond the Voice of Fame:</L>
<L>Those lofty Pinnacles which once were seen,</L>
<L>Bright like the Majesty that dwelt within.</L>
<L>In which Seraphick Glory cou'd reside,</L>
<L>Too great for human Vision to abide;</L>
<L>Whose glittering Fabrick, <HI>God</HI> the Architect,</L>
<L>The Sun's less Glorious Light, did once reject</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These all ha' felt the Iron hands of Fate,</L>
<L>And Heaven's dear Darling City's desolate.</L>
<L>No more the sacred Place commands our Awe,</L>
<L>But all become a Curse, a <HI>Golgotha.</HI></L>
<L>The Reverend Pile can scarce its Ruines show,</L>
<L>For sook by him whose Glory made it so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<L>Yet <HI>Ostia</HI> stands, her impious Towers defie</L>
<L>The threatning Comets of the blazing Sky,</L>
<L>Foreboding Signs of Ruine she despises,</L>
<L>And all her teaching Saviour's Sacrifices;</L>
<L>The Jews are Fools, <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s out-done,</L>
<L>We crucifie the Father, they the Son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within her Reprobate Gates there are allow'd</L>
<L>Worse Jews than those which crucified their God:</L>
<L>They kill'd a Man, for they suppos'd him so;</L>
<L>These boldly sacrifice the God they know,</L>
<L>His Incarnation Miracles deny,</L>
<L>And vilely Banter his Divinity;</L>
<L>Their old Impostor, <HI>Socinus,</HI> prefer,</L>
<L>And the long Voyage of Heaven without a Pilot steer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet <HI>Ostia</HI> boasts of her Regeneration,</L>
<L>And tells us wondrous Tales of Reformation:</L>
<L>How against Vice she has been so severe,</L>
<L>That none <HI>but Men of Quality</HI> may swear:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
How Publick Lewdness is expell'd the Nation,</L>
<L>That <HI>Private Whoring</HI> may be more in fashion.</L>
<L>How Parish Magistrates, like pious Elves,</L>
<L>Let none be Drunk a Sundays, <HI>but themselves.</HI></L>
<L>And Hackney Coach-men durst not Ply the Street</L>
<L>In Sermon-time, <HI>till they had paid the State.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These, <HI>Ostia,</HI> are the Shams of Reformation,</L>
<L>With which thou mock'st thy Maker, and the Nation;</L>
<L>While in thy Streets unpunish'd there remain</L>
<L>Crimes which have yet insulted Heaven in vain,</L>
<L>Crimes which our Satyr blushes to review,</L>
<L>And Sins thy Sister <HI>Sodom</HI> never knew:</L>
<L>Superiour Lewdness Crowns thy Magistrates,</L>
<L>And Vice grown grey usurps the Reverend Seats;</L>
<L>Eternal Blasphemies, and Oaths abound,</L>
<L>And Bribes among thy Senators are found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old Venerable <HI>Jeph,</HI> with trembling Air,</L>
<L>Ancient in Sin, and Father of the Chair,</L>
<L>Forsook by Vices he had lov'd so long,</L>
<L>Can now be vicious only with his Tongue;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Yet talks of ancient Lewdness with delight,</L>
<L>And loves to be the Justice of the Night:</L>
<L>On Baudy Tales with pleasure he reflects,</L>
<L>And leudly smiles at Vices he corrects.</L>
<L>The feeble tottering Magistrate appears</L>
<L>Willing to Wickedness, in spite of Years;</L>
<L>Struggles his Age and Weakness to refist,</L>
<L>And fain wou'd sin, but Nature won't assist.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>L—l,</HI> the <HI>Pandor</HI> of thy Judgment-Seat,</L>
<L>Has neither Manners, Honesty, nor Wit;</L>
<L>Instead of which, he's plenteously supply'd</L>
<L>With Nonsence, Noise, Impertinence, and Pride;</L>
<L>Polite his Language; and his flowing Stile</L>
<L>Scorns to suppose Good Manners worth his while;</L>
<L>With Principles from Education stor'd,</L>
<L>Th' Drudgery of Decency abhor'd:</L>
<L>The <HI>City-Mouth,</HI> with Eloquence endu'd,</L>
<L>To Mountebank the listning Multitude,</L>
<L>Sometimes he tunes his Tongue to soft Harangues,</L>
<L>To banter Common Halls, and flatter Kings:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="11"/>
And all with but an odd indifferent Grace,</L>
<L>With Jingle on his Tongue, and Coxcomb in his Face;</L>
<L>Definitive in Law, without Appeal,</L>
<L>But always serves the Hand who pays him well:</L>
<L>He Trades in Justice, and the Souls of Men,</L>
<L>And prostitutes them equally to Gain:</L>
<L>He has his Publick Book of Rates to show,</L>
<L>Where every Rogue the Price of Life may know:</L>
<L>And this one Maxim always goes before,</L>
<L>He never hangs the Rich, nor saves the Poor.</L>
<L>God-like he nods upon the Bench of State,</L>
<L>His Smiles are Life, and if he Frown 'tis Fate:</L>
<L>Boldly invading Heaven's Prerogative;</L>
<L>For with his Breath he kills, or saves alive.</L>
<L>Fraternities of Villains he maintains,</L>
<L>Protects their Robberies, and shares the Gains,</L>
<L>Who thieve with Toleration as a Trade,</L>
<L>And then restore according as their paid,</L>
<L>With a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ward scornful Phyz, and vile Grimace,</L>
<L>The g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Talents of an ugl, Face;</L>

<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<HI>F—e</HI> for so sometimes unrighteous Fate</L>
<L>Erects a Mad-man for a Magistrate,</L>
<L>Equipt with Leudness, Oaths, and Impudence,</L>
<L>Supplies with Vices his defect of Sence;</L>
<L>Abandon'd to ill Manners, he retains</L>
<L>His want of Grace, as well as want of Brains.</L>
<L>Before the Boy wore off, the Rake began,</L>
<L>The Bully then commenc'd, and then the Man.</L>
<L>Yet Nature seems in this to do him wrong,</L>
<L>To give no Courage with a saucy Tongue;</L>
<L>From whence this constant Disadvantage flows,</L>
<L>He always gives the Words, and takes the Blows;</L>
<L>Tho' often Can'd, he's uninstructed by't;</L>
<L>But still he shews the Scoundrel with the Knight,</L>
<L>Still scurrilous, and still afraid to fight.</L>
<L>His Dialects a <HI>Modern Billingsgate,</HI></L>
<L>Which suits <HI>the Hositer,</HI> not the Magistrate;</L>
<L>The same he from behind the Counter brought,</L>
<L>And yet he practis'd worse than he was taught;</L>
<L>Early debauch'd, in Satan's Steps he mov'd,</L>
<L>And all Mechanick Vices he improv'd:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="13"/>
At first he did his Sovereign's Rights invade,</L>
<L>And rais'd his Fortune by clandestine Trade;</L>
<L>Stealing the Customs, did his Profits bring,</L>
<L>And 'twas his Calling to defraud his King:</L>
<L>This is the Man that helps to Rule the State,</L>
<L>The City's New-reforming Magistrate.</L>
<L>To execute the Justice of the Law,</L>
<L>And keep less Villains than himself in awe;</L>
<L>Take Money of the Rich, and hang the Poor,</L>
<L>And lash the Strumpet he debauch'd before.</L>
<L>So for small Crimes poor Thieves Destruction find,</L>
<L>And leave the Rogues of Quality behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search all the Christian Climes from Pole to Pole,</L>
<L>And match for Sheriffs <HI>S—ple</HI> and <HI>C—le;</HI></L>
<L>Equal in Character and Dignity,</L>
<L>This fam'd for Justice, that for Modesty:</L>
<L>By Merit chosen for the Chair of State,</L>
<L>This fit for <HI>Bridewell,</HI> that for <HI>Billingsgate;</HI></L>
<L>That richly clad to grace the Gaudy Day,</L>
<L>For which his Father's Creditors must pay:</L>
<L>This from the fluxing Bagnio just dismist,</L>
<L>Rides out to make himself the City Jest.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
From some <HI>lascivious Dish-Clout</HI> to the Chair,</L>
<L>To punish Leudness and Disorders there;</L>
<L>The Brute he rides on wou'd his Crimes detest,</L>
<L>For that's the Animal, and this the Beast:</L>
<L>And yet some Reformation he began;</L>
<L>For Magistrate ne're bear the Sword in vain.</L>
<L>Expensive Sinning always he declin'd,</L>
<L>To <HI>frugal Whoring</HI> totally resign'd:</L>
<L>His Avarice his Appetite opprest,</L>
<L>Base like the Man, and brutish like the Lust:</L>
<L>Concise in Sinning, Nature's Call supply'd,</L>
<L>And in one Act two Vices gratified.</L>
<L>Never was Oyster, Beggar, Cinder Whore,</L>
<L>So much caress'd by Magistrate before:</L>
<L>They that are nice and squeamish in their Lust,</L>
<L>'Ts a sign the Vice is low, and wants a Gust;</L>
<L>But he that's perfect in the Extreme of Vice,</L>
<L>Scorns to excite his Appetite by Price.</L>
<L>'Twas in his Reign we to Reform began,</L>
<L>And set the Devil up to mend the Man.</L>
<L>More might be said, but Satyr stay thy Rimes,</L>
<L>And mix not his Misfortunes with his Crimes.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<HI>C—n</HI> superbly wise and grave of Life,</L>
<L>Cou'd every one reform, except his Wife:</L>
<L>Passive in Vice, he Pimps to his own Fate,</L>
<L>To shew himself a Loyal Magistrate.</L>
<L>'Tis doubtful who debauch'd the City more,</L>
<L>The Maker of the Masque, or of the Whore.</L>
<L>Nor his Religion less a Masquerade;</L>
<L>He always drove a strange mysterious Trade:</L>
<L>With decent Zeal, to Church he'll gravely come,</L>
<L>To praise that God which he denies at home.</L>
<L><HI>Socinian T—d</HI>'s his dear Ghostly Priest,</L>
<L>And taught him all Religion to digest.</L>
<L>Took prudent Care he shou'd not much profess,</L>
<L>And he was ne're addicted to Excess.</L>
<L>And yet he <HI>Covets</HI> without Rule or End,</L>
<L>Will sell his Wife, his Master, or his Friend.</L>
<L>To boundless Avarice a constant Slave,</L>
<L>Unsatisfy'd as Death, and greedy as the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, Satyr, let us view the numerous Fry,</L>
<L>That must succeeding Magistrates Supply,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>
And search if future Years are like to be</L>
