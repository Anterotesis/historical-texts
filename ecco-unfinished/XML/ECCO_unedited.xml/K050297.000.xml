<HEAD>TO THE
Right Honourable Sidney Lord
Godolphin, Lord High Trea∣surer
of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THE Author of these is none of those numerous Attendants,
which the envious Party says</HI> Wait at your levee, and
pay Homage to the Profits, they expect from your
Power.</P>
<P>As these envy your Lordship that Trust, which the Nation
in general, sees your Lordship discharge with an Integrity equal,
and Success beyond all that ever went before you. So, pardon me,
my Lord, to say, The humble Author of these Sheets, wholly
unknown to your Lordship, shaded by his Obscurity, from the
Sun-shine of your Bounty, and in no Expectation of Reward,
thinks your Lordships Defence so much his Duty, in Gratitude
as an English Man, and in Return for his share in common,
with the rest of his Country, of the Blessings receiv'd from
your exquisite Management of the Nations Treasure, that he
could not see you attack'd with so much Insolence, without ex∣posing
that Spirit of Malignity that so much reigns at your
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Lordship and the whole Government, in a Party whose whole
Complaint is, that they are thrown out of a Trust they had no
Temper or Bounds, in the Discharge of; and from which,
nothing but their Resolutions to ruine us all, could have dis∣plac'd
them.</P>
<P>Your Lordship, however, has the Satisfaction to be thus
treated in very good Company: Her Majesty has a double
Portion of the Rage of this Party thrown upon Her Royal
Conduct; The Moderation of the Queen is first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uled
and abused, and Her Majesty is then said, <HI>with an unpara∣lell'd
Insolence,</HI> to be wean'd from the Church; and that the
Church does not stand in the same Rank, in Her Esteem, as it
formerly did.</P>
<P>The Bishops are charg'd with being Traytors to the Church
and the Sacred Office, discharg'd from being a Signature of
a True Church-man.</P>
<P>The whole House of Lords are said to bully the Commons
with Things which they have nothing to do with.</P>
<P>All the Loyal Church of <HI>England</HI> Men in the Nation, that
are not for <HI>The shortest Way with the Dissenters,</HI> in the
Litteral Sense, are Abettors of a Faction.</P>
<P>Thus, my Lord, the Nation is insulted by a Party, or at
least, by a sroward Author, who writes in the Name of a
Party, and whose Book the Party are far from disou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing.
And, to sum up all; He brings them up to the Face of the
Government, and threatens the Resentment of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
It has often been said, in Behalf of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and that even by this Party, That her Loyalty is such, she
cannot be provok'd to Rebellion: A certain sign these Gentle∣men
are not of that Church, when they tell your Lordship and
the Government, P. 12. “The Principles of the Church of
<HI>England</HI> will dispose Men to bear a great deal, but he is a
mad Man that will try how much; and that Nature is apt
to rebell against Principle.”</P>
<P>From hence it would seem a just Enquiry to be made of
these Gentlemen, what Church they mean, since it cannot be
meant of the Protestant Church of <HI>England,</HI> even by their
own Principles, If of the Protestant Church of <HI>England</HI> they
speak, when they complain of the Danger arriv'd to Her, by turning
the <HI>D</HI> of <HI>B</HI>—my Lord <HI>R</HI>—and my Lord <HI>N</HI>—it might not
be improper to enquire what mighty Things those noble Lords
ever did for the Church, and what the Church has suffer'd by
their most necessary Dismission.</P>
<P>My Lord, 'tis hop'd your Lordship and the Government, who
were not ignorant of the Temper of this Party, when you shew'd you
durst disarm them of their Power, will equally contemn their
Threatning and Buffoonry, while disarm'd and appearing unfit
to be trusted they shew their Teeth, snarle at the Power they
misimprov'd, and attempt to bully your Lordship with their
impotent R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tment.</P>
<P>The Queen, my Lord and the Government, have nothing to
fear from these Men. <HI>Like the Devil,</HI> their Rage is great,
because their T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne is short. Murther, Treason, and Asassina∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
they once fled to in the late Reign, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
found their Reward at the Gallows, where all the Satisfaction
they could have, was to have one High-Church Man absolve an∣other,
and own that those behind, had as much Hand in the
Guilt as those that went before.</P>
<P>God Almighty, we trust, will protect the Queen from the
bloody Designs of exasperated mad Men; and as for their
Resentment as a Party, I am perswaded your Lordship sleeps
in quiet, and cannot but do so, while administring your high
Trust with so equal a Hand, so faithful to the Queen, and so sa∣tisfactory
to the People. Your Lordship has the Satisfaction
to see, That not one Man either▪ envys or complains, but in
the Behalf of a Party, whose chief Discontent arises from the
Loss of that Power they knew not how to manage, had neither
Temper enough to execute, nor Moderation enough to bear the
Loss of.</P>

<HEAD>THE
MEMORIAL
EXAMIN'D.</HEAD>
<P>THat no Age can paralell the Moderation of the present Go∣vernment,
the Contempt of snarling Enemies, their
Disregard of Slander and intolerable Insolence, are Testimonyes
be yound Exception.</P>
<P>The Daily Insults of a Party, which the Government may,
and which some think they ought to resent, are most un∣accountable.</P>
<P>The Loose the hot Men of this Party give to their
Tongues, even in the most Sacred Place the Church, the
Sacred Office of the Pulpit; and their common Discourse is
such, as no Government but this, would ever bear with; a
clear and apparent Proof that the Queen and the Ministry,
act by those Principles of Temper and Moderation, that they
at the same Time perswade the Nation to.</P>
<P>But, as if the Party were resolved to try the Extent of Royal
Patience, and see, how long the Queen may be insulted, and
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
the Government ridicul'd, before Her Majesty can be provok'd
to shew her just Resentment such Usage calls for. We have
now publish'd a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>The Memorial of the
Church of England. Humbly offered to the Consideration of all
true Lovers of our Church and Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>To present the Reader with the Heads of this Tract, full
of Words, full of horrible Suggestions, and most barbarous
Treatment, both of the Queen, the Ministry, and the Diffenters,
would be to answer it Paragraph by Paragraph, a Thing too
tedious, and too big for this small Tract; but as the most
significant Part of it is reduceable to a few Heads, I shall
give a short Abridgment of the Substance, and then speak to
the Whole, as a Thing all of a Piece, with some other De∣signs
of the Party, express'd in different manner.</P>
<P>The whole Book is a virulent Exclamation against the Go∣vernment;
a meer <HI>Church Legion.</HI> The Stile, gross and unman∣nerly,
fill'd with all that Vehemence and Gall, that a Party
(who in Place were furious, and out of Place Revengeful)
could be imagin'd to be fill'd with.</P>
<P>The Subject of this Libel is, <HI>The Danger of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The Foundation of that, the Author places in the Turn of
the Court, and Change of the great Officers.</P>
<P>The Instruments of this Change are call'd,</P>
<P>The present Ministry; and particularly, The Lord Treasurer,
Duke of <HI>Marlbro'</HI> and his Dutchess.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Bishops,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Diffenters,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Whig Lords,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Low-Church,
<LIST>
<ITEM>And at last the QUEEN.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These are loaded with infamous Terms, horrid Suggestions,
presumptive Insinuations, Facts unprov'd, a long and black
Charge of Corruption, and Designs to overthrowthe Constitution;
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
all the Evils of our Affairs, abroad and at home, are laid at their
Door, as Enemies to their Country, and Destroyers of the
Church; and at last they are openly threatned with the Churches
Resentment.</P>
<P>He begins with what he calls▪ <HI>The History of the Dissenters
Carriage towards the Church;</HI> asserting positive and premeditated
Falshoods.</P>
<P>“1. That at the Death of King <HI>William</HI> they were ready
to have thrown a Blank to the Church, and would have taken
a general Indemnity, with an Exclusion from all publick
Trust and Office.”</P>
<P>“2. That not a Month before, they breathed nothing but
Defiance, insulted the Church, and treated the Princess
with the most scandalous Indignities: That now, they
preach nothing but Charity, Peace, Love, Forgiveness of
Injuries, Oblivion of Wrongs, and the utter Extinction of
Parties for ever; so very good and gracious can Men in
Fear be.”</P>
<P>Really, if a Man were to measure the Danger of the Church
asserted in this Book, by this Relation, and the Truth of the first was
to be judged by the Truth of the last, the Controversy might
soon end.</P>
<P>If the Dissenters were in this pickle, at the Death of the late
King, pray Gentlemen, come forth and make good this Charge.</P>
<P>What were the Crimes they had commited, for which they
wanted Indemnity?</P>
<P>You say their own Consciences, P. 5. prompted them to seek
Pardon and Peace—Pray, who did they seek it for, and who
were the Persons they sought it of?—'Tis very strange and
wonderful, these Criminals that wou'd have thrown the Church
a Blank, were neither Pardon'd nor Punished.</P>
<P>We read of no Act of Indemnity, in Her Majesty's Reign; the
Church never offer'd to grant it, and the Diffenters had no oc∣casion
to ask it: 'Tis very hard to find out what the Crimes were
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
the Dissenters had Commited, that they were in such pain
about, and how their Fears came to be blown over.</P>
<P>Well, but says this <HI>Legeon</HI> Author, in the very next Para∣graph;
<HI>They found the Head of the Church, and after her Example,
the Members too, enclin'd to forgive,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> With all humble Deference to Her Majesty's Clemency,
the Dissenters think themselves happy, in endeavouring
to merit Her Majesty's Protection, and value themselves,
in having hitherto avoided coming into any Condition, which
should make them fly to Her Mercy.</P>
<P>Forgiveness in a Prince, implyes Guilt in the Subject: Now,
with all the Respect to the Publck Justice Immaginable, I must
say, where there is no Guilt there is no Need of Forgiveness.
The Dissenters cannot be thought to lessen her Majesty's Mer∣cy,
by insisting upon their Innocence, and not seeking any Par∣don
'till they are convicted of a Crime.</P>
<P>“But they insulted the Church, and abused the Princess.”</P>
<P>To this the Dissenters must plead, Not guilty too; and de∣mand
who are the Men, let them be brought forth, let them
come to Justice, it is not yet too late; we desire they may re∣ceive
no Mercy: And on the other Hand, we demand, If two
Earls, often thus named among the List of the Church's
Friends—which <HI>N</HI>—and <HI>R</HI>—did not use the <HI>Queen</HI>
as ill, during the last Reign, as any Person whatsoever.</P>
<P>Thus, the Great Foundation Charge against the Dissenters,
stands upon a Column of Falshood and Forgery; and by exa∣mining
into the Truth of Fact <HI>falls to the Ground of it self.</HI> And
the fourth and fifth Pages of this Book are pleased to impose
three point blank Falsities, that have no Colour for them, but
in the Malignant Humour of the Relater.</P>
<P>And 'tis a great Felicity to the Nation and Government,
that the present inveterate Malice of the high Party, is oblig'd
to fly to <HI>a Refuge of Lyes</HI> for its Support, imposing positive
Contradictions in Defence of Erroneous Suggestions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Again, says this false Accuser, “The Dissenters, as soon as
they found the <HI>Queen</HI> gave them Assurances and comfortable
Speeches, return'd to their Former Insolences and Presum∣ption.”</P>
<P>All this is still beg'd, here's no Proof of Fact, nor
indeed can there be; the Person, or Examples are not brought
to light; and these bold Assertions remain absolutely unprov'd.</P>
<P>From this History of the Dissenters Carriage, not one Word
of which hath had the Good Fortune to be true: The Memorial
proceeds to tell us of, “<HI>The Advances which have been made in their
Favour,</HI> and <HI>Repulses the Church has met with,</HI> all Attempts
to settle it having been opposed, and rendered ineffectual.”</P>
<P>And who is all this done by? Who has given the Church so
many Repulses? Who made Advances to the Dissenters, and
opposed the Settlement of the Church?</P>
<P>The Persons charg'd, in this black List are, The <HI>Queen,</HI> and
My Lord Treasurer.</P>
<P>And a bold and insolent Suggestion is made, that the Mem∣bers,
who have places, hold them of my Lord <HI>T</HI>—, by this
Tenure, <HI>viz.</HI> To vote against the Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> is then charg'd with turning out the E—of
<HI>Jersey,</HI> Sr. <HI>E—S</HI>—, the E. of <HI>N</HI>—, and the E. of <HI>R</HI>—,
only because their Consciences made them adhere steadily to
the Interest of the Church.</P>
<P>Nor is this all the Insult offered the <HI>Queen,</HI> but P. 6, 7. Her
Majesty is brought in, putting the Church out of her Favour,
that she might keep the D—ke and Dutchess of <HI>M</HI>—, in her
Favour, wean'd from the Church, and suffering all that ad∣hered
firmly to the Church, to be driven from her Favour.</P>
<P>All these Insolences are suggested of the <HI>Queen</HI> and Ministry,
to introduce the Picture of Moderation; and this they draw as
monstrous as they can make it: in the <HI>Queen</HI> They call it
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Partiality for the Diffenters, and boldly affirm, P. 8. That
<HI>“the Church does not hold the same Rank, in the</HI> Queen's <HI>Esteem
and Confidence, that it held heretofore: That Her Majesty
was fill'd with Apprehensions of the Mischicvous Heat and
Passion of the C—Men.”</HI></P>
<P>In this, Manner for about twenty six Pages, this Monstrous
Libel goes on to expose the <HI>Queen</HI> and her Ministry, as Ene∣mies
to the Church, all along intermixing Threatnings of the
Church's Resentments and calling to Account for these Things;
buffoons my Lord Treasurer, as triming against his Principle; in∣sults
the <HI>Queen</HI> as aw'd by her Ministry, and not daring to shew
her Dislike, represents the Dissenters as rushing into the Royal
Favour; upbraids the Minisiry with spiriting up a Faction, and
making them pretend to the whole Power, who were so de∣press'd,
that they would have purchas'd Impunity, with In∣capacity;
charging them with disobliging the best House of
<HI>C—ns</HI> that ever any Prince had, and from an idle Jealousy of
some Lords rising in the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Favour, courting and truck∣ling
to the Lord <HI>Wh—Somers</HI> and <HI>H—fax,</HI> who requite
them with Contempt.</P>
<P>The Bishops, the House of Lords, and all the Gentry of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' never so constant in her Com∣munion,
and loyal to her Principles, that cannot come up to
the Intemperance and Zeal of this Party, come in for a Share
of their Reproaches: And at last, 'tis all sum'd up, P. 26. Thus,
the present prospect of the <HI>C—ch</HI> is very melancholyand so is
that also of the Government, <HI>&amp;c</HI></P>
<P>From this Period, the Book proceeds to a Satyr upon Mode∣ration—and
Abundance of false and unaccountable Assertions;
which indeed, give the Book some Disadvantage, as Lyes al∣ways
do, to any Cause, and which we shall endeavour to de∣tect.</P>
<P>Several Pages run on to examin the Impotencies of an Act of
Comprehension, and then addressing to the Moderate Clergy
of the C—of <HI>England,</HI> comes on an Offer to yeild, in Mat∣ters
of Ceremony, to the Dissenters, but at the same Time
tells them, it will notbe accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12"/>
As this is a Horrible Insolence in offering that in the Name of
the <HI>C.</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> which the <HI>C.</HI> has always refus'd, and which there can
be no Legal Authority to offer, it is a Mine laid for the Offence of
the Dissenters, but breaks out backward, to the shaking the Repu∣tation
of the whole Book, discovers the Authors of it not to be of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> speaks without Book, and as they say what
they cannot prove, so they propose what they cannot perform.</P>
<P>From hence the Book runs on to insult the Lords in the Case
of the <HI>Aylesbury</HI> Men, and so sets up in Defence, as it is call'd, of
the Rights and Privileges of the Commons. To this I shall not
offer any thing, the Reasons of the Lords having sufficiently done
it, and the Brevity of these Papers not admitting it.</P>
<P>The Conclusion of the Book is a Defence of the Tackers; and
this is done with a Mixture of Insults and Threatnings, how and
in what manner it shall be attempted in the next Parliament,
and in Explicit Terms, telling the Queen, She shall have no Mo∣ney
till 'tis past, and threaten the Consequences lying on those
that refuse it.</P>
<P>In short, the Insolence of this Book is Unaccountable and Intol∣lerable:
If the Authors and Publishers of it go Unpunish'd, the
Government must expect yet greater Insults than these, and tho'
<HI>except</HI> in more <HI>Coventry</HI> Tumults, 'tis hardly possible; yet, all
that can be the Consequence of such Insolence, ought to be expe∣cted,
if this way of treating Governments be not suppress'd.</P>
<P>Who the Author of such a rank Excursion must be, is not for
me to determine. Sometimes 'tis call'd <HI>Ʋs,</HI> speaking of the Cler∣gy;
sometimes <HI>Ʋs,</HI> speaking of the House of Commons: Some∣times
the <HI>Spectre</HI> appears in one Shape, sometimes in another. All
I can in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er is, and I think it seems to be the Sense they would
have the Book be understood in, that it is a Conjunction of Sediti∣ous
Heads laid together, some of the Church, some of the State,
some in the late House, some out of it, and so may pass as before,
for the Party's <HI>Legion,</HI> the Church's <HI>Scandalous</HI> Club; for sure no∣thing
so Extravagant, nothing so Abominable, nothing so Un∣seemly,
so Disloyal, Disrespectful or Undutiful, ever came from
the Church of <HI>England</HI> to Her Sovereign.</P>
<P>In order to consider this Inveterate Excursion, this Flux of
High-Church Choler, with a little more Temper than is shewn
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
in its own Method, I shall begin to state the Case a little fairly,
and I hope unexceptionably between us, which I take to be the
truest Method to come at the Decision, and if possible, the end of
this Controversy.</P>
<P>If in doing this, I am oblig'd to be free with some Persons,
whose Quality demands some more Respect than their Integrity,
tho' some may object against it, yet the Authors of this Book
cannot, whose Indecencies even to their Sovereign must stop their
Mouths, and wholly incapacitate them from being Censurers of
Manners.</P>
<P>As the Memorial begins with the first of this Reign, so must I.
When the High-Church Party had disgorg'd themselves of their
restrain'd Spleen in most extravagant Insults and Triumphs on
the Death of King <HI>William,</HI> when they had with unparallell'd
Insolence upbraided and insulted the Whigs with their certain
approaching Destruction, when Down with the Phanaticks,
Down with the Presbyterians, Down with the Meeting-Houses,
had been so long the Cry, that the whole Party began to be
out of Breath with it. The first Heat of their Joy being a lit∣tle
over, they fell diligently to work, to put in Practice what
was always in their Hearts to do; and what they began to
think, <HI>now,</HI> was the only Opportunity to bring to pass.</P>
<P>If any Man will debate with me the Matter of Fact, and
deny that these Insults were the Voice of the Party, I'll un∣dertake
to bring such Crowds, such Volumes of High-Church
Sayings to make it out, as it shall no longer remain a De∣bate.</P>
<P>Is the <HI>D—g Dead,</HI> said an Eminent Divine of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> not far from <HI>Glocester</HI> Shire? Then your God Almigh∣ty
is gone to the Devil, and not a Dissenter shall be left in the
Nation.</P>
<P>D—ye <HI>Jack,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Man is gone, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid a wise Gentleman
of <HI>Essex,</HI> that calls himself a Champion of the Church, he is
Dead, <HI>Hogen Mogen</HI> is Dead, and we have got a Protestant
Queen. Now you Rogue, we'll Down with these Dogs, and
I hope there shall not be a Meeting-House left in the Nation for
those Phanatick Rogues to Cant in.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14"/>
These Things are not worth naming here; but to introduce
this General, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Party having been disappointed in
the late King, whose Immoderate Clemency even to themselves
was his greatest Mistake, and counting all his (to them redious)
Reign a Restraint to 'em from the old Temper of Persecution
and Destruction, which ever since the Restoration they had
breath'd out against the Dissenters, they thought at the Coming
of the Queen to the Throne, their Time was come.</P>
<P>Her Majesty at Her first Accession to the Throne, as a full De∣monstration
of Her Sincere Affection to the Church and to all
its most Zealous and Pious Members, and firmly believing
the Sincerity of these Church-Men to be equal to their Pro∣fession,
put Her Self and the Nation wholly into their
Hands.</P>
<P>When Her Majesty did this, it was with such a Declaration of
Her true Design for the Good of all Her Subjects, that had these
Gentlemen had the least Foresight of Things, had they weigh'd
the Justice, the Candour, the Prudence and Piety of the Queen,
had they consider'd the Publick Good, the Means of obtaining a
happy Conclusion of Troubles Abroad, and avoiding the Embar∣rasment
of Parties at Home, they could not have imagin'd Her
Majesty could entertain Thoughts equally Destructive of any part
of Her Subjects to what they had suppos'd.</P>
<P>But all these Matters were hid from their Eyes; the Fury of
their Party-Zeal so unhappily hood wink'd their Politicks, that
they could see nothing before them. So far had their eager Thirst
after the Ruin of their Brethren blinded them to their own Interest,
that they suffer'd nothing to stand in their Way, but filling their
Mouths with the Church, the Church, like the Cry of <HI>Diana</HI> of
the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> they run on with this Extreme, That <HI>nothing could
procure the Safety of the Church, but the Destruction of the Dis∣senters.</HI></P>
<P>The first Shock this Warmth met with, was from a small,
but inconsiderable Difference between Men, who, tho' of the
same Principle as to the Dissenters, yet of a disserent Interest as
to Politicks, happen'd to clash in their Design.</P>
<P>This happen'd between the Jacobite Non-Jurant Clergy, and
High-Church Complying Clergy.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15"/>
The first of these were in hopes of some Turn in Favour of
their old Master's Posterity, and at least expected from the Queen,
that the Right of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> should be Recogniz'd, and
that Her Majesty enjoying the Crown for Life, should restore it
as to the right Owner after Her Decease.</P>
<P>It was thought most of our High Church-Men would have
come into this Project, but when they began to Examine it, it
struck so directly at Her Majesty's Right of Possession, that they
saw it was to no purpose to attempt it; and those Lords, who
they had the Face to move it to, presently Objected it would be
to acknowledge Her Majesty an Usurper, and at best to bring
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be the right Heir, only lending the
Crown to his Sister for Life, with a Reserve to himself and his
Heirs.</P>
<P>This being an irreconcileable Difficulty, gave the first Killing-Wound
to the Party, which appear'd United and Formidable be∣fore;
for now all the Jacobite-Party fell off, and Rail'd at the
Queen as an Usurper, just as they did before at the King.</P>
<P>This Necessity of Owning the Queen's `Right to depend upon
the Revolution Settlement, drove the High-Church-Men all to a
yet worse Extream, and that was to fall in with the <HI>Hannover</HI>
Succession, confirm'd with an Abjuration.</P>
<P>This lost them yet more of their Friends, and so weakened
their Party farther.</P>
<P>These Steps, which indeed the Nature of Things more than
the Inclination of these People led them to, brought them gradu∣ally
to see the open Designs of the Jacobite-Party; and the Con∣sequence
was plain, That if the Queen sat on the Throne by
the Right of Parliament Limitation, which was the Effect of
King <HI>William</HI> and the Revolution, all those Parties who were
Enemies to the King and the Revolution, could not but be
Enemies to the Queen's Interest, and the Succession of <HI>Han∣nover.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Church and the Dissenters were found to have but
one and the same Civil Interest, whatever their Religious Inte∣rest
might seem to be.</P>
<P>This was such a Choak-Pear to this High-Party, who, in their
Imagination, had swallow'd up the Dissenters, that it put them
out of all manner of Bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
The Pretence of Loyalty to the Queen they could not go from,
but they treated the Succession with all possible Contempt; and
finding the Principle upon which the present Establishment stood,
would of course lead the Queen to moderate Measures, and to
join with all her Subjects that profess'd Revolution Doctrins,
they shew'd their Partiality to the Interest of King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Po∣sterity
and Party upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>It would be endless, and put me by more necessary Clauses,
here to recite the Indecencies, the Slights, the Contempts put
upon the Family of <HI>Hannover,</HI> whom on all occasions they have
represented as no Friends to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before they
know them.</P>
<P>It may suffice, that they discover'd these Discontents upon all
Occasions; and as the Ministery was wholly in these Hands,
the Fury of their Proceedings, the Ends they aim'd at, and the
Means they propos'd for it, discover'd themselves so, that it just∣ly
gave Offence to the Queen, and to all those of the Nobility and
Gentry that had any Compassion for their Native Country, and
who had Wisdom to see the Tendency of those unhappy Mea∣sures,
that they found it absolutely necessary to begin upon a third
Foundation in general, <HI>viz.</HI> to Establish the Nation's Security upon
the blessed Mean, between all these Extreams, and Build up the
Nation's Safety upon the Heavenly Foundation of Party, Peace
and Moderation.</P>
<P>That Perswasions to Peace, that Principles of Moderation, that
Union among Protestants, should Enrage a Party, make them Fu∣rious
and Distracted, might occasion some Wonder; were it not,
that whoever considers it, struck at the Root of their Design, blew
up all their Hopes of rooting out the Dissenters, and put an end
to the Expectation and Ambition of the whole Party, must allow
it was very Provoking.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Pulpit immediately Thundred against all the Mo∣d'rate-Church-Men,
as Enemies to the Church, Association, Plots,
Rebellion, and every Thing possible, that might blacken them
to the Government, are pretended.—Bloody Flags and Destru∣ction
of Dissenters was Preach'd up, as the necessary Duty of all
that had any true Love for the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
But it still more and more exasperated them, to see that the
more they push'd at these Extreams, the more the Eyes of all ho∣nest
Men began to be opened.</P>
<P>The Queen, who far from any Thoughts so Barbarous as these
People had suggested, yet had put the Management of Affairs
wholly into their Hands, and expected better Treatment, was
justly mov'd at this manner of Proceeding; and finding the
Dissenters really and justly Allarm'd at a prevailing Party so open∣ly
threatning their Destruction, Her Majesty thought fit to re∣peat
Her Assurance to them, That the Toleration Act should
be inviolably Preserv'd, and they on their part, behaving them∣selves
Dutifully, should be sure of Her Royal Protection.</P>
<P>How the Party treated Her Majesty upon this Head, how Sir
<HI>E—S.</HI> the Ld. <HI>R.</HI>—and <HI>N—M.</HI> express'd themselves upon
these Heads, what Threatnings, what Insulrs, what Reproaches
upon Her Majesty's Principles as well as Conduct, follow'd these
Wise and Moderate Proceedings of Her Majesty? If I should
enumerate them here, the World would cease to Wonder,
why Her Majesty clear'd Her Hands and Her House of such a
Ministry.</P>
<P>Under this general Contempt of the Party, fell with Her
Majesty, my Lord Treasurer, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and
all the Men of Wisdom and Temper in the Court.</P>
<P>Not all the Faithful Discharge of a difficult Office, not the re∣covering
the National Credit, almost Bankrupt by deficiency of
Funds and a Tedious Expensive War: Not the most Punctual
Untainted Fidelity to his Mistress the Queen, as well as his Mo∣ther
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> could fence my Lord Treasurer a∣gainst
the Reproaches of Time-Server, Trimmer, and a hundred
Ignonimous Slanders: Not venturing his Life in the most despe∣rate
Engagements: Not a wise and consummate Conduct in the
Congress of Forreign Allies: Not prodigious Marches: Not un∣heard
of Adventures, or unparallell'd Victories, can screen the Duke
of <HI>Marlborough</HI> from being charg'd as an Enemy to that Church
he was always bred up in, and has always vigorously Fought to
Maintain.</P>
<P>Nay, so eagerly did they watch for the least Miscarriage of
this Great Man, than whom next to King <HI>William,</HI> none ever
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
labour'd more, or hazarded himself more for the Publick Good:
That when that prodigious March of His from the <HI>Maes</HI> to the
<HI>Danabe</HI> was first undertaken, a certain great Man, whose Name
I forbear in respect to his Family, not his Party; when the News
came, that the Mareschal <HI>Tallard</HI> had joyn'd the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
and we all look'd upon the Project as defeated: This Gentleman
clapt his Hand upon his Knee, with this Expression of the
Duke—<HI>G—D—him: Nothing but his Head shall satisfie for
this March.</HI> So that 'tis apparent, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> Fought
for his Life more ways than one, and had he not Conquer'd, tho'
his Grace might have scap'd the Shot of the <HI>French,</HI> he had
the Axe prepar'd for him at Home, as the Reward of all his
Services Abroad</P>
<P>But Success sanctify'd the Action, and Heaven that saw
the Snare, deliver'd the Duke and the Nation both at a
Blow.</P>
<P>From this short History, which indeed tho' exactly true in
Fact, is but an Abstract of those Things. I draw these Conclu∣sions,
which I humbly Recommend to the Consideration of our
High-Church-Complainants.</P>
<P>That neither the Queen nor a select Ministry, has Displac'd
these Gentlemen, but <HI>Themselves,</HI> their own fiery furious Mea∣sures.
And how can the Authors of this Pamphlet, say, <HI>They
were Conscious to themselves of no intemperate Behaviour.</HI> p. 8. Will
they join Issue upon that Point? Let their Parliamentary Debates,
their Conference Speeches, their, Sermons Pamphlets, Discourses,
their Cabinet Measures; let them be brought on the Stage, and
the World will soon Determine whether they were Guilty of any
Intemperate Behaviour or no.</P>
<P>Nor has the Lord Treasurer or the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> much
less the Queen, yet less the Bishops, abandon'd the Church. All
Men know my Lord Treasurer remote from a Dissenter, or from
that you call a Whig; that he was always so in Principle: Nay,
themselves own it, for while they call the Queen a Whig and the
Bishops Presbyterians, my Lord comes under another Scandal of a
Trimmer.</P>
<P>Now Gentlemen, if you will run up to such Excess that no
wise Man can go with you, who can you blame? My Lord
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
Treasurer has not left the Church, but You have driven him from
You in Defence of the Church: You have forc'd him from You
because He would not be Mad.</P>
<P>What could else make a Church of <HI>England</HI> Queen? The
Church of <HI>England</HI> Bishops and above three Fourths of a Church
Nobility stand at a Distance from you.</P>
<P>If Men will be Mad, they must not expect to be joyn'd by
those that remain in their Wits; the Queen, the Bishops,
the Moderate Clergy, the Peers, the Gentry, are they all Con∣verted
to Phanaticism, or are You turn'd Lunaticks of ano∣ther
Kind?</P>
<P>The Business in short is, this happy Conjunction, is seeking
the Church's Safety one Way, and You another.</P>
<P>'Tis agreed the Church is in Danger, and I joyn with You,
that the Prospect of the Church is very Melancholy; but I differ
in the Circumstance. The Danger of the Church is from You,
that would Enflame Her, Embroil Her with Parties, Raise a
Civil Feud in Her Bowels, and place Her in <HI>Ishmael</HI>'s Circum∣stance,
with Her Hand up against every Body, and every Bo∣dy's
Hand against Her.</P>
<P>Now the Queen, and the Ministry, and the Bishops, and
Moderate Clergy, who are all known to be steddy Adherers
to the Church, are on one side, and the High-Church-Men
on the other.</P>
<P>These are seeking the Church's Safety in the Nation's Peace;
You in Persecution, Oppression and Ruin of your Neighbours;
and because You will have these Extremes to be the Measures,
the Government, who cannot be convinc'd of the Reasonable∣ness
of your Way, have laid You by, and resolve to go on
their Way. Now the Question is, Whether Peace or Persecu∣tion
be the best Way to Establish the Church.</P>
<P>To get off of this Difficulty, the Party never found a ready
Way till now; and this Author has hit of it, <HI>The Churches Danger.</HI>
But the Misfortune of it is, that the Thing would be a very Effe∣ctual
Proof, only that it happens to be false in Fact, and no Body
but an Author with such a Face could possibly advance such a
Thing.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="20"/>
Persecution was declar'd, <HI>tho' some thought a little too hasty</HI> in
the first Occasion Bill, and <HI>therefore left out in the second,</HI> to be
contrary to the Principles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Christian Religion.—</P>
<P><HI>But to come off of this, this Memorial declares, p. 35.</HI> If the
parting with a few Ceremonies in the Form of our Worship would
Reconcile and Ʋnite them sincerely to our Church, we are ready to Sa∣crifice
them to their Scruples. Let them state their Demands: <HI>Im∣pudent
Forgery! Was ever any thing like this?</HI></P>
<P>Would the Church have Sacrific'd a few Ceremonies to the
Scruples of the Dissenters, there had been at this Day but few
Dissenters; all the Heads of their Ministers, all the principal
Leaders of their Numbers had Conform'd at first. And 'tis
apparent, that when their Demands were stated, and it was re∣fer'd
to Bishop—his Answer was, <HI>That the Church would part
with none of her Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but now you will.—How does this appear? Who
is it that makes the Offer, and calls upon the Dissenters to make
their Demands? Is it the Church? Will they make an Order of
Convocation? Shall there be a second Conference, and shall it be
with more Sincerity than the first?</P>
<P>Let us see a stated Authority before us which the Church will
stand by, ready to make such Concessions to really scrupulous Con∣sciences,
and ready to abate what shall appear reasonable to be
abated; and it will soon appear, whether the Dissenters, at least
in such Numbers as would make your Occasional Bill useless,
would not come over to You.</P>
<P>As this therefore is the only way to Answer the Dissenters, so
this Memorial takes hold of the crafty Part of the Argument,
and makes a right Use of it: But where is the Call let us see it?
Done! There shall be no need of a Call for the Demands, they
will be ready Made and Defended.</P>
<P>But then says the Author, it must be from the whole Body:
This is another Fallacy, presuming great Numbers will not come
into it.</P>
<P>I believe not such Numbers would come into it, as would have
done at the <HI>Savoy</HI> Conference; but I believe 100000 Families of
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
Dissenters would come into it, if the Concessions were Christian
and Sincere.</P>
<P>But let me tell the Gentlemen of the High Church, this cannot
be their Sense, and that in particular proves it a Presumption
in the Author of this Legion.</P>
<P>For should the Church of <HI>England</HI> by Concession of her indif∣ferent
Things, open a Door for all those Dissenters to come in,
who could comply; as these new Converts would be then Entitu∣led
to the publick Posts and Trusts in the Government, and be all
Low Church Men or Whigs, as ye call them, for such they would
certainly be: What would then become of your High Church?
They might in time come to open the Door farther, Vote down
your Liturgy, Episcopacy, and what not; and so the Church's
Danger would encrease from the Conversion of the Party: There∣fore
in their Senses, the High-Church-Men cannot wish to let
them into the Church, and so all this fine and most specious
Scheme of Charity and Agreement, appears a meer Sham; what
the Church in general has given no Commission to offer, and
what the Party in particular cannot desire, without wishing their
own Extirpation and effectual Ruin as a Party.</P>
<P>Thus a scandalous Refuge of Lies runs thro' the whole Book:
The Design of which is plain,</P>
<P>To fill the Nation with ill Suggestions of the Queen, the Mi∣nistry,
the Bishops and the House of Lords, as Persons estrang'd
from the true Interest of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> abetting Whigs
and Dissenters, and invading the Privileges of the Commons.</P>
<P>How absurd the Imagination is, how managed with Gall and
Bitterness, little Argument and no Manners; I Appeal to the
Book for.</P>
<P>But lest it should not prevail with all Parties, and that every
Sort may be dealt with by Arguments most suitable to their own
Constitution, there are Wheedlers for the Foolish, such as the—sham
Offer of Church Moderation hinted before: Then there are
Frights for the Timerous, such as Threatnings of the Church's
Resentment, and that in Terms so Insolent, that in Obedience to
<HI>Sachevrel</HI>'s Commands, the Bloody-Flag is hung out, even against
the Queen and Ministry; and much less than this should have been
call'd Rebellion in a Dissenter.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22"/>
The Memorial advises our States-men to consider in Time,
(that is, before it was too late) <HI>P.</HI> 12. “Whether the Provoca∣tions
given to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> may not if continued, be
strong enough to rouze Nature to Rebel against Principle, for
tho' the Church is not to be wrought up to Rebellion, yet <HI>the,</HI>
(THE HIGH-CHURCH) may be so Allarm'd, as
to secure themselves at the Peril of those Ministers who give
them the Allarm.”</P>
<P>If this be not Rebellion, I would be glad to see it Explain'd.
Here is a plain Deposing the Ministry, which is in all Ages under∣stood
the King or Queen; all Rebellions have been thus managed.
<HI>Evil Counsellors</HI> has been the Cry in all the popular Tumults that
we have seen.</P>
<P>The Case of the <HI>Spencers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> occasion'd the Taking up
Arms against, and afterwards the Deposing the King; and tho'
the Case had some Justice in it there, yet they won't alledge the
same in King <HI>Charles</HI> the First: And these Things afterwards
practised in the late Civil-War, brought the Church to make that
famous Declaration against a certain <HI>Trayterous Position,</HI> of taking
Arms against the King's Authority, but not against His Per∣son.</P>
<P>Now how these Gentlemen can <HI>secure themselves at the Peril of
the Ministry,</HI> which must mean <HI>the Queen</HI> in Her Authority,
and Her Counsellors in their Persons, and yet acquit themselves
of Rebellion, is a Secret J want mightily to see Disclosed.</P>
<P>And what is become of our passive Doctrin all this while? 'Tis
fairly thrown by in the same Page. “Perhaps our wise Men
think themselves secure in the passive Principles of the Church.
If this be the true Motive, they may be Simple-well-meaning-Men,
but must be wretched Politicians. The Principles of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> will dispose Men to bear a great deal, but
he is a mad Man that tries how much. For when Men are ve∣ry
much provoked, Nature is apt to Rebel against Principle.
Nor is it to be expected that they should long bear to be thus
used.”</P>
<P>From thus going on to Threaten the whole Nation with
taking Arms, they in particular Bully my Lord Treasurer thus</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23"/>
The Treasurer is Wise, let him therefore look to that, and ma∣turely
Weigh who is to be provoked at this Time.</P>
<P>Of all the Pamphlets that were ever Publish'd in <HI>England</HI> since
the Restoration, none ever spoke such plain <HI>English</HI> as this, I
think it needs no Comment; 'tis a plain Declaration of the depo∣sed
Ministry, for they are in every Paragraph mentioned as the
Persons for whom the Party are Aggriev'd.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 25. They are Enumerated, the D. of <HI>B—ham,</HI> E. of
<HI>No—ham, Ro—r, Jer—y, Winch—sea,</HI> Sir <HI>Ed. Se—r,</HI>
L. <HI>Gran—l, Gl—rd, Go—r,</HI> E. of <HI>Dysert,</HI> Sir <HI>G.—Ro—k.</HI>
These, says the Memorial, turn'd out <HI>without the
least Pretence or Colour of Offence.</HI> Page 26. <HI>Was any Thing ob∣jected
to them that might deserve to be Punished with the Loss of their
Places?</HI></P>
<P>Here's Obedience! The Queen must be Ask't what Her Ma∣jesty's
Reasons are for Dismissing Her Officers.</P>
<P>In the next Paragraph the Bishops are Cry'd down, and we
are told, <HI>Lawn-Sleeves are no Tokens of True Church-Men:</HI> But a
few they tell us are left, and to these an Humble Petition is made,
That <HI>the Lower-Clergy, who want only to be Headed and Counte∣nanc'd,
may be Encourag'd to Exert themselves in Defence of the
Church.—And to shew their respective Congregations the Evil
of that Position, that there ought to be no Distinction among Pro∣restants.</HI></P>
<P>And now Gentlemen, do You ask Reasons why the Queen
and the wiser Men of the Nation <HI>left your Measures?</HI> Do You
ask for what Reason these Men were turn'd out of Office?
For what Reason your <HI>own Bishops,</HI> and the best of your Clergy
abandon'd You?</P>
<P>These very Things were the Reasons, because they saw You
abandon all manner of <HI>Temper,</HI> they saw You bent at <HI>Embroiling
the Nation,</HI> Trampling on your Brethren, Persecuting <HI>Consci∣ence,</HI>
and Widening <HI>Breaches;</HI> they saw You all Sworn Enemies
to Peace, and that You had doom'd all your Christian Brethren
to the Devil <HI>the Shortest Way;</HI> they saw You Mad with Fury,
and Drunk with Rage, and by no Measures to be ruled or
guided.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Thus You turn'd out your Selves; You drove every Man of
Moderate Principles from You; You made all your Friends a∣fraid
of you; and to allow some People to see as well as your
Selves, the Queen dismiss'd You, that You might not by your
precipitant Conduct overthrow the Church You pretended to
secure. Her Majesty sent your <HI>Bu—hams, Nott—hams,
G—vills</HI> and <HI>Dy—ts,</HI> your <HI>Sey—rs</HI> and <HI>R—ks</HI> home,
that they might retire into the Country, <HI>Shave their Heads,</HI>
Air their Understandings, and coming up again like <HI>Nebuchadnez∣zar,
when he came Home from Grass,</HI> new Men, recover'd and
found, they might be better qualify'd to guide the State, and be
capable of finding out some other Ways to secure the Church,
than by flying in the Face of Law, Liberty and Consci∣ence,
to the Reporoach of Religion, and Scandal of the Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>Of all Men in the Nation, I think these have the least
Reason to complain of Her Majesty's dismissing them in time,
who, had they been suffer'd to go on, must have been dis∣plac'd
by the Axe or the Halter, for involving their So∣vereign
in the Oppressions, Breaches and Tyranny of their
Ministry.</P>
<P>The Queen, who is far from being that <HI>Tool of Her Ministry,</HI>
which they suppos'd Her, and which their own Experience
might tell them <HI>She was not.</HI> Tho' Her Majesty's Zeal for
the Church is beyond the Reach of their Slander, yet having
never design'd to Establish it on Blood and Perfecution, soon
found it absolutely necessary to <HI>Check this Torrent.</HI> Her Ma∣jesty
on all Occasions declar'd Her Love of Peace and earnest
Desire of the Union of Her People, and prosess't Her Resolu∣tion
to promote it. But when Her Majesty's Measures came
to be laid before these Gentlemen, they all <HI>flew in the Face of
their Sovereign.</HI> Thus they turn'd themselves out of Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
And do they now ask the Queen a Reason, why they are dis∣miss'd?
<HI>Why really Gentlemen,</HI> because the Queen wanted no
<HI>Jehu's,</HI> no <HI>Boutefeus,</HI> no <HI>Firebrands</HI> to root out and destroy the
Church. But her Majesty and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> taught
by better Masters, and built on better Principles, suitable to
the Gentle, Meek and <HI>easy to be entreated Rules</HI> of the Christi∣an
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
Religion, were not to be hook'd into these <HI>bloody Measures,</HI>
but broke the <HI>Projected Ruin of Her People,</HI> heal'd the early
Wound, quench'd the Fire in its first kindling, and the Men
dropt of Course.</P>
<P>And it is to be remark'd with what Regret Her Majesty saw
the Necessity of parcing these rash People, and yet what ill
Use they make of Her Royal Forbearance, how long She try'd
them, with what Patience Her Majesty has born their Insults,
how long before they were turn'd out, how often sollicited to
change their Measures and to joyn in the general Good, how
many of them Her Majesty has left in their Places to this
Hour, striving to Convince and Reclaim 'em, and hoping for
their Amendments, and not one Man put out, that could be
prevail'd with to fall in with the Interest of his Country, and
of the Church.</P>
<P>And as these are the Measures the Queen has us'd, 'tis
plain, You have turn'd cut your Selves, and You will go
on to ruin your Selves to the last Gasp; your Inveterate
Speeches, your Malignant Spirits, your <HI>Tacking,</HI> your <HI>Co∣ventry
Elections,</HI> your Bullying the Government, what do
they all tend to, but your own Ruin? And if God and
the Queen had no more Mercy for, and in regard to, the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> than these Men, they would make Her
first a Prey to any Enemy that should next Invade Her, by
ruining that Union and Peace, which alone, <HI>Miracles excepted,</HI>
can uphold Her.</P>
<P>And as every Step this Party has larely taken, has been a
Step backward as to their own Interest, so let us examine
a little the general Scheme of this Book.—One would think
it was writ by some Body that was in a Plot against the High-Church,
that it was <HI>an Irony,</HI> to Expose 'em, like <HI>Defoe's Short∣est
Way with the Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>To have the Passive Church of <HI>England</HI> threaten to secure
themselves at the Peril of the Queen's Ministers, to have them
tell Her Majesty, <HI>for telling the Ministry so, is the same thing,</HI> She
had best not to provoke 'em too much.—</P>
<P><HI>What can be the Ʋse of this?</HI> Really Gentlemen, not at all to
Awe, Affright, or Terrify the Minitry, whose Protection is
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
in the Laws, and the Laws in the whole People of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
but 'tis hanging out a Lanthon in a dark Way, to
tell the Queen and Her Ministry, if they meet with any
Obstruction, or any Interruption in their Government, <HI>who to
lay their Hands on first.</HI> And I must recommend it to the D. of
<HI>B.</HI> my Ld. <HI>N. R.—I—y, W—sea, D—t, Gr—vill,
G—er,</HI> Sir <HI>E. Seymr.</HI> Sir <HI>G. R.</HI> and the outed Gentlemen
to consider, whether in some Countrys and Governments
such an Impudent Suggestion would not have caus'd them
all to have been taken up, and at least to have given Cauti∣on
and very good Hostages for their Behaviour and Forth-Coming.</P>
<P>And therefore it seems well worth heir Consideration,
whether it does not behove them to Teftifie their Abhorrence
of a Pamphlet, which insults their Sovereign in their Names,
and to protest openly against the Seditious Principles, suggested
by a Party who pretend to Expose their Interest?</P>
<P>Nor is this needful for them, in respect to Duty and their
Obligation to the Queen only: But if this exasperated Spirit of
a High-Party should, <HI>as God only knows where it will end,</HI> reach
to offer any Insolence to the Queen's Person, what could these
Gentlemen, <HI>singled and mark'd out as the Persons in whose Behalf
this is done,</HI> expect from the People? For my part, I do not
think any Body can answer for the Rage of a provok'd Nation,
if Assassination, as it has once been entred into by this very
Party, should come a second time into their Design, and God
for our Sins should suffer any Fatal Effect of it to be brought
to pass, who shall answer for it? That the enrag'd People would
not make an immediate Sacrifice of those Men in the first Heat,
as the very Persons pointed out in this Book, for whose sakes
these Things were openly threatned.</P>
