<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>IF the author of the Complete History of England may be allowed to judge from the extraordinary demand for his work, and the sentiments of many persons, for whose opinions he has the utmost deference, this addition will be favourably received, and in∣deed required by his readers, as a completion of the original plan.</P>
<P>In this task he has engaged with the greater alacrity, as the subject teems with incidents and events which the historian can record with pleasure, and the reader peruse with pe∣culiar satisfaction.</P>
<P>The latter part of what has been offered to the public exhibits an unpleasing tissue of mis∣conduct and miscarriage; at home, an ad∣ministration without vigour; abroad, a war without success: in a word, a people groan∣ing under the double pressure of internal dis∣content and external dishonour. In the period that remains to be discussed, the scene is agreeably changed, and presents such a for∣tunate assemblage of objects as never occur∣red in any other aera of English history.</P>
<P>The views of the crown are at length re∣conciled to the desires of the people. We
<PB N="iv" REF="40"/>
see, for the first time, a minister in full pos∣session of popularity, requiring infinitely greater subsidies than ever were exacted under any former reign, since the beginning of the mo∣narchy; and the subjects paying them with chearfulness, because they confide in the inte∣grity of the administration, and know those liberal aids will be expended for the honour and advantage of the commonwealth. We have also lived to see the fallacy of a perni∣cious and spurious maxim, adopted by some late ministers, that the machine of govern∣ment could not be properly moved, unless the wheels were smeared with corruption.</P>
<P>Our military operations are now planned with so much wisdom and sagacity, and exe∣cuted with such spirit, as revive the lustre of past ages; and the glory of our late conquests even rivals the renown of those heroic at∣chievements which dignify and adorn the an∣cient annals of Great Britain. We behold valour tutored by conduct, sentiment united with courage, and the godlike virtues of hu∣manity shining in the midst of slaughter and desolation. What is still more extraordinary, and above all other circumstances redounds to the honour of our national councils, we feel none of those rude tempests that are raised by the furious breath of war. Notwithstand∣ing all the hostile efforts of the▪ most formi∣dable enemy, which Discord could have
<PB N="v" REF="50"/>
armed against this island, we enjoy the bless∣ings of security and repose▪ as if we were hedged around by some Divinity; and our commerce flourishes undisturbed as in the bosom of peace.</P>
<P>Themes like these cannot fail to warm the heart, and animate the pen of the historian▪ who glows with the love of his country. Yet he will carefully avoid the imputation of en∣thusiasm. In the midst of his transports he hopes to remember his duty, and check the exuberance of zeal with the rigid severity of historical truth.</P>
<P>This is the guiding star by which he hath hitherto steered his dangerous course; the star whose chearing radiance has conducted him safe through the rocks of prejudice and the tides of faction. Guiltless of all connexions that might be supposed to affect his candour▪ and endanger his integrity, he is determined to proceed with that fearless spirit of inde∣pendence, by which he flatters himself the former part of the work hath been remark∣ably distinguished. Equally incapable of ser∣vile complaisance to power, and implicit at∣tachment to particular systems, he will praise without reserve, and blame without appre∣hension, as often as virtue merits his applause or vice provokes his censure; and the reader shall have no just cause to tax him with having concealed any important blemish or
<PB N="vi" REF="60"/>
defect even in the most shining character, so far as it falls within the province of history.</P>
<P>He takes this opportunity of expressing his warmest acknowledgments to those gentle∣men who have contributed their advice and assistance towards the execution of this de∣sign; and as he is provided with authentic materials for that purpose, he doubts not but that he shall be able to preserve the favour of the public, which he shall always assidu∣ously cultivate, in presenting it with the sequel of a work, which hath surmounted every species of opposition, and acquired some degree of credit, though unowned by patronage, and unsustained by party.</P>
<P>N. B. As many anonymous writers have been hired to abuse this work in printed papers and pamphlets, the author takes this opportunity of declaring, that if any person of character in the Republic of Letters shall think proper to censure this history in print, and set his name to his animadversions, he (the author) will answer them to the best of his power; but it cannot be expected that he should employ his time in disputing with obscure, mercenary, and desperate scribblers, who en∣list themselves under the banners of malicious interested calumny, and may be said to subsist upon the wages of assassination.</P>

<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GEORGE II.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748. Reflec∣tions on thepeace.</NOTE> THE peace of Aix-la▪Chapelle, however unstable or inglorious it might appear to those few who understood the interests, and felt for the honour of their country, was nevertheless not unwelcome to the nation in general. The Bri∣tish ministry will always find it more difficult to satisfy the people at the end of a successful cam∣paign, than at the conclusion of an unfortunate war. The English are impatient of miscarriage and disappointment, and too apt to be intoxicated with victory. At this period they were tired of the burthens, and sick of the disgraces, to which they had been exposed in the course of seven tedious campaigns. They had suffered considerable losses and interruption in the article of commerce, which was the source of their national opulence and power▪ they knew it would of necessity be clogged with
<PB N="8" REF="80"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> additional duties, for the maintenance of a con∣tinental war, and the support of foreign subsidia∣ries; and they drew very faint presages of future success either from the conduct of their allies, or the capacity of their commanders.</P>
<P>To a people influenced by these considerations, the restoration of a free trade, the respite from that anxiety and suspence which the prosecution of a war never fails to engender, and the prospect of speedy deliverance from discouraging restraint and op∣pressive impositions, were advantages that sweet∣ened the bitter draught of a dishonourable treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to acquiesce in the peace, not barely without murmuring, but even with some degree of satisfaction and applause.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erents of the prince of Wales join the oppo∣sition in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Immediately after the exchange of ratifications at Aix-la-Chapelle the armies were broke up: the allies in the Netherlands withdrew their several pro∣portions of troops; the French began to evacuate Flanders: and the English forces were reimbarked for their own country. His Britannic majesty re∣turned from his German dominions in November, having landed near Margate in Kent, after a danger∣our passage; and on the twenty-ninth of the same month he opened the session of parliament. By this time the misunderstanding between the two first personages of the royal family had been en∣creased by a fresh accession of matter. The prince of Wales had held a court of stannery, or what is called a parliament, in quality of duke of Cornwall; and revived some claims attached to that dignity, which, had they been admitted, would have greatly augmented his influence among the Cornish bo∣roughs.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> These efforts aroused the jealousy of the admi∣nistration, which had always considered thm as an interest wholly depending upon the crown; and therefore the pretensions of his royal highness were opposed by the whole weight of the ministry. His adherents resenting these hostilities as an injury to their royal master, immediately joined the remnant of the former opposition in parliament, and re∣solved to counteract all the ministerial measures that should fall under their cognizance; at least, they determined to seize every opportunity of thwart∣ing the servants of the crown, in every scheme or proposal that had not an evident tendency to the advantage of the nation.</P>
<P>This band of auxiliaries was headed by the earl of E—t, Dr. Lee, and Mr. N—t. The first pos∣sessed a species of eloquence rather plausible than powerful: he spoke with fluency and fire: his spirit was bold and enterprising, his apprehension quick, and his repartee severe. Dr. Lee was a man of extensive erudition and irreproachable morals, parti∣cularly versed in the civil law, which he professed, and perfectly well acquainted with the constitution of his country. Mr. N—t was an orator of mid∣dling abilities, who harangued upon all subjects in∣discriminately, and supplied with confidence what he wanted in capacity: he had been at some pains to study the business of the house, as well as to understand the machine of government; and was tolerably well heard, as he generally spoke with an appearance of good humour, and hazarded every whimsical idea as it rose in his imagination. But Lord Bolingbroke is said to have been the chief spring which, in secret, actuated the delibera∣tions
<PB N="10" REF="100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> of the prince's court. That nobleman, seemingly sequestered from the tumults of a pub∣lic life, resided in the neighbourhood of London, at Battersea, where he was visited like a sainted shrine by all the distinguished votaries of wit, elo∣quence, and political ambition. There he was cul∣tivated and admired for the elegance of his man∣ners, and the charms of his conversation. The prince's curiosity was first captivated by his cha∣racter, and his esteem was afterwards secured by the irresistible address of that extraordinary per∣sonage, who continued in a regular progression to insinuate himself still farther and farther into the good graces of his royal patron. How far the conduct of his royal highness was influenced by the private advice of this nobleman, we shall not pretend to determine: but, certain it is, the friends of the ministry propagated a report, that he was the dictator of those measures which the prince adopted; and that, under the specious pretext of attachment to the heir-apparent of the crown, he concealed his real aim, which was to perpetuate the breach in the royal family. Whatever his sen∣timents and motives might have been, this was no other than a revival of the old ministerial clamour, importing, that a man cannot be well affected to the king, if he pretends to censure any measure of the administration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the mi∣nistry.</NOTE> The weight which the opposition derived from these new confederates in the house of commons, was still greatly overballanced by the power, in∣fluence, and ability, that sustained every ministerial project. Mr. Pelham, who chiefly managed the helm of affairs, was generally esteemed as a man of
<PB N="11" REF="110"/>
honesty and candour, actuated by a sincere love for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> his country, though he had been educated in er∣roneous principles of government, and in some measure obliged to prosecute a fatal system, which descended to him by inheritance.</P>
<P>At this time he numbered Mr. Pitt among his fellow-ministers, and was moreover supported by many other individuals of distinguished abilities; among whom the first place, in point of genius, was due to Mr. M—, who executed the office of sollicitor-general. This gentleman, the son of a noble family in North Britain, had raised himself to great eminence at the bar, by the most keen intuitive spirit of apprehension, that seemed to seize every object at first glance, an innate sagacity that saved the trouble of intense application, and an irresistible stream of eloquence, that flowed pure and classical, strong and copious, reflecting, in the most conspicuous point of view, the subjects over which it rolled, and sweeping before it all the slime of formal hesitation, and all the intangling weeds of chicanery.</P>
<P>Yet the servants of the crown were not so im∣plicitly attached to the first minister as to acquiesce in all his plans, and dedicate their time and talents to the support of every court-measure indiscrimi∣nately. This was one material point in which Mr. Pelham deviated from the maxims of his prede∣cessor, who admitted of no contradiction from any of his adherents or fellow-servants, but insisted upon their sacrificing their whole perception and faculties to his conduct and disposal. That sordid deference to a minister no longer characterised the subordinate instruments of the administration.
<PB N="12" REF="120"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> It was not unusual to see the great officers of the government divided in a parliamentary debate, and to hear the secretary at war opposing with great vehemence a clause suggested by the chancellor of the exchequer.</P>
<P>After all, if we coolly consider those arguments which have been bandied about, and retorted with such eagerness and acrimony in the house of com∣mons, and divest them of those passionate tropes and declamatory metaphors which the spirit of op∣position alone had produced, we shall find very little left for the subject of dispute, and sometimes be puzzled to discover any material source of dis∣agreement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session opened.</NOTE> In the month of November his majesty opened the session of parliament with a speech, importing, That the definitive treaty of peace was at length signed by all the parties concerned; That he had made the most effectual provision for securing the rights and interests of his own subjects; and pro∣cured for his allies the best conditions, which, in the present situation of affairs, could be obtained. He said, he had found a general good disposition in all parties to bring the negotiation to a happy conclusion; and observed, that we might promise ourselves a long enjoyment of the blessings of peace. Finally, after having remarked that times of tranquillity were the proper seasons for lessen∣ing the national debt, and strengthening the king∣dom against future events, he recommended to the commons the improvement of the public reve∣nue, the maintenance of a considerable naval force, the advancement of commerce, and the cultivation of the arts of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748▪</NOTE> This speech, as usual, was ecchoed back by an address to the throne from both houses, contain∣ing general expressions of the warmest loyalty and gratitude to his majesty, and implying the most perfect satisfaction and acquiescence in the articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate on the address▪</NOTE> The members in the opposition, according to custom, cavilled at the nature of this address. They observed, that the late pacification was the worst and most inglorious of all the bad treaties to which the English nation had ever subscribed: that it was equally disgraceful, indefinite, and absurd: They said the British navy had gained such an ascendency over the French at sea, that the sources of their wealth were already choaked up; that the siege of Maestricht would have employed their arms in the Low Countries till the arrival of the Russians; and that the accession of these auxilia∣ries would have thrown the superiority into the scale of the allies. They did not fail to take no∣tice, that the most important and original object of the war was left wholly undecided; and they de∣monstrated the absurdity of their promising, in the address, to make good such engagements as his majesty had entered into with his allies▪ before they knew what those engagements were.</P>
<P>In answer to these objections the ministers re∣plied, That the peace was in itself rather better than could be expected; and that the smallest delay might have proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They affirmed, that the Dutch were upon the point of concluding a neutrality, in consequence of which their troops would have been withdrawn from the allied army; and, in that case, even the
<PB N="14" REF="140"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> addition of the Russian auxiliaries would not have rendered it a match for the enemy. They asserted, That if the war had been prolonged another year, the national credit of Great Britain must have been intirely ruined, inasmuch as many of the public funds had in the preceding season sunk below par, so that the ministry had begun to despair of seeing the money paid in on the new subscription.</P>
<P>With respect to the restoration of Cape Breton, the limits of Nova Scotia, and the right of navi∣gating without search in the American seas, which right had been left unestablished in the treaty; they declared, That the first was an unnecessary expence, of no consequence to Great Britain; and that the other two were points in dispute, to be amicably settled in private conferences by commis∣saries duly authorised; but by no means articles to be established by a general treaty.</P>
<P>The British ministry, in the course of their par∣liamentary contests, have generally injured their own projects, by attempting to prove positions in∣discreetly urged in the face of common sense and understanding. Had they rested their defence of the treaty upon the imminent danger to which the States of the United Provinces were exposed, and the certain prospect of their being obliged to withdraw their forces from the general confederacy, the plea would have been perhaps universally ad∣mitted; or, at least, it would have served as a plausible excuse for closing with certain proposals, which, in other circumstances, ought to have been rejected with disdain. But, in presuming to offer such an outrage to the understanding of the people, as that of declaring, that the disputes which pro∣duced
<PB N="15" REF="150"/>
the war were not the objects to be dis∣cussed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> in the treaty of peace; and that the national credit of Great Britain would not probably suf∣fice to animate the operations of another cam∣paign; they exposed themselves to the censure and the ridicule of all the world, and even invalidated the credit which their other allegations had a right to acquire.</P>
<P>If the public credit had run any risque, or un∣dergone the smallest shock, this misfortune was not owing to the war, but to the shameful practices of the ministers themselves, who endeavoured to make a job of the subscription, for the benefit of their favourites and understrappers. As in every former expedient of this kind the subscription had sold for a considerable premium, they concluded that this would meet with the same eager reception; and in this hope parcelled out the greater part of it among their friends and adherents, though few of them had credit sufficient to borrow money for the first payment of the large sums for which they were allowed to subscribe: a circumstance of which those who were really moneyed men took the advantage. They were determined against submitting to the tyranny of this ministerial job; and they restrained their impatience to purchase, well knowing that the subscription would fall to a considerable discount. The difficulty, therefore, that threatened to clog the operations of government, was owing to a scan∣dalous spirit of monopoly and oppression in the members of the administration, not to the distresses of the public, which we have lived to see in a flou∣rishing condition, under the load of much greater incumbrances.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="160"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748. Supplies granted.</NOTE> What the opposition wanted in strength, it en∣deavoured to make up with spirit and perseverance. Every ministerial motion and measure was can∣vassed, sifted, and impugned with uncommon art and vivacity: but all this little availed against the single article of superior number; and accord∣ingly this was the source of certain triumph in all debates, in which the servants of the crown were united. The nation had reason to expect an im∣mediate mitigation in the article of annual expence, considering the number of troops and ships of war which had been reduced at the ratification of the treaty: but they were disagreeably undeceived in finding themselves again loaded with very extraor∣dinary impositions, for the payment of a vast debt which the government had contracted in the course of the war, notwithstanding the incredible aids granted in parliament.</P>
<P>Four points of consideration did the committee of supply establish, in their deliberations concern∣ing the sums necessary to be raised; namely, for fulfilling the engagements which the parliament had entered into with his majesty, and the services undertaken for the success of the war; for dis∣charging debts contracted by the government; for making good deficiencies; and for defraying the current expence of the year.</P>
<P>It appeared, that the nation owed four and forty thousand pounds to the elector of Bavaria; above thirty thousand to the duke of Brunswic; the like sum to the landgrave of Hesse Cassel; and near nine thousand pounds to the elector of Mentz. The queen of Hungary claimed an arrear of one hun∣dred thousand pounds. The city of Glasgow, in
<PB N="17" REF="170"/>
North Britain, presented a petition, praying to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748▪</NOTE> reimbursed in the sum of ten thousand pounds, ex∣torted from that corporation by the son of the Pre∣tender, during the rebellion. One hundred and twelve thousand pounds were owing to the forces in North America and the East Indies; besides near half a million due on extraordinary expence incurred by the land forces in America, Flanders, and North Britain, the office of ordnance, and other services of the last year, to which the par∣liamentary provision did not extend. The re∣maining debt of the ordnance amounted to above two hundred and thirty thousand pounds: but the navy bills could not be discharged for less than four millions. The addition of two millions three hun∣dred and seventy four thousand three hundred thir∣ty-three pounds fifteen shillings and two pence, were required for the current service of the year. In a word, the whole annual supply exceeded eight millions sterling; a sum at which the whole nation expressed equal astonishment and disgust. It was charged upon the duties on malt, mum, cyder, and perry, the land-tax at four shillings in the pound, annuities on the sinking fund, an applica∣tion of one million from that deposit, and a loan of the like sum to be charged on the first aids of next session. The number of seamen was reduced to seventeen thousand, and that of the land forces to eighteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven, including guards and garrisons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opposi∣tion to a demand of the Empress-queen.</NOTE> Every article of expence, however, was warmly disputed by the anti-courtiers; especially the de∣mand of the queen of Hungary, which was deemed unreasonably exorbitant and rapacious, considering
<PB N="18" REF="180"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the seas of blood which we had shed, and the im∣menfity of treasure we had exhausted for her be∣nefit: and surely the subjects of this nation had some reason to complain of an indulgence of this nature, granted to a power which they had literally snatched from the brink of ruin; a power whose quarrel they had espoused with a degree of enthu∣siasm, that did much more honour to their gallantry than to their discretion: a power that kept aloof, with a stateliness of pride peculiar to herself and family, and beheld her British auxiliaries fighting her battles at their own expence; while she squan∣dered away, in the idle pageantry of barbarous magnificence, those ample subsidies which they ad∣vanced in order to maintain her armies, and furnish out her proportion of the war. The leaders of the opposition neglected no opportunity of embittering the triumphs of their adversaries: they inveighed against the extravagance of granting sixteen thou∣sand pounds for the pay of general and staff of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icers during a peace that required no such esta∣blishment, especially at a juncture when the na∣tional incumbrances rendered it absolutely neces∣sary to practise every expedient of oeconomy. They even combated the request of the city of Glasgow to be indemnified for the extraordinary exaction it underwent from the rebels; although it appeared, from unquestionable evidence, that this extraordi∣nary contribution was exacted on account of that city's peculiar attachment to the reigning family; that it had always invariably adhered to revolution-principles; and, with an unequalled spirit of loyal∣ty and zeal for the protestant succession, distinguish∣ed itself both in the last and preceding rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748. Progress of the bill relating to sea∣men.</NOTE> But the most violent contest arose upon certain regulations which the ministry wanted to establish in two bills, relating to the sea and land service. The first, under the title of a bill for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parlia∣ment the laws relating to the navy, was calculated solely with a view of subjecting half-pay officers to martial law: a design which not only furnished the opposition with a plausible handle for accusing the ministers, as intending to encroach upon the con∣stitution, in order to extend the influence of the crown; but also alarmed the sea-officers to such a degree, that they assembled to a considerable num∣ber, with a view to deliberate upon the proper means for defending their privileges and liberties from invasion.</P>
<P>The result of their consultations was a petition to the house of commons, subscribed by three ad∣mirals and forty-seven captains, not members of parliament, importing, That the bill in agitation contained several clauses tending to the injury and dishonour of all naval officers, as well as to the detriment of his majesty's service; and that the laws already in force had been always found effectual for securing the service of officers on half-pay, upon the most pressing occasions: they therefore hoped, that they should not be subjected to new hardships and discouragements; and begged to be heard by their counsel, before the committee of the whole house, touching such parts of the bill as they ap∣prehended would be injurious to themselves and the other officers of his majesty's navy. This petition was presented to the house by Sir John Nor∣ris, and the motion for its being read was second∣ed
<PB N="20" REF="200"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> by Sir Peter Warren, whose character was uni∣versally esteemed and beloved in the nation.</P>
<P>This measure had like to have produced very serious consequences. Many commanders and sub∣al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erns had repaired to the board of admiralty, and threatened, in plain terms, to throw up their com∣missions, in case the bill should pass into a law; and a general ferment was begun among all the subordinate members of the navy. A motion was made, That the petitioners, according to their re∣quest, should be heard by their counsel; and this proposal was strongly urged by the first orators of the antiministerial association: but the minister, confiding in his own strength, reinforced by the abilities of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Lyttleton, and Mr. Fox the secretary at war, strenuously opposed the mo∣tion, which, upon a division, was thrown out by a great majority.</P>
<P>The several articles of the bill were afterwards separately debated with great warmth; and al∣though Mr. Pelham had, with the most disinterested air of candour, repeatedly declared that he required no support, even from his own adherents, but that which might arise from reason unrestrained, and full conviction, he, on this occasion, reaped all the fruit of their zeal and attachment which could be expected from the most implicit complaisance. Some plausible amendments of the most exception∣able clauses were offered, particularly of that which imposed an oath upon the members of every court-martial, importing, that they should not, on any ac∣count, disclose the opinions or transactions of any such tribunal. This was considered as a sanction under which any court-martial might commit the most fla∣grant
<PB N="21" REF="210"/>
acts of injustice and oppression, which even<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the parliament itself could not redress, because it would be impossible to ascertain the truth, eternally sealed up by this absurd obligation. The amendment proposed was, that the member of a court-martial might reveal the transactions and opinions of it, in all cases wherein the courts of justice, as the law now stands, have a right to interfere, if required thereto by either house of parliament: a very rea∣sonable mitigation, which however was rejected by the majority. Nevertheless, the suspicion of an in∣tended encroachment had raised such a clamour without doors, and diffused the odium of this mea∣sure so generally, that the minister thought proper to drop the projected article of war, subjecting the reformed officers of the navy to the jurisdiction of courts martial; and the bill being also softened in other particulars, during its passage through the upper house, at length received the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objecti∣ons to the mutiny-bill.</NOTE> The flame which this act had kindled, was rather encreased than abated at the appearance of a new mutiny-bill, replete with divers innovations, tend∣ing to augment the influence of the crown, as well as the authority and power of a military jurisdic∣tion. All the articles of war established since the reign of the second Charles, were submitted to the inspection of the commons; and in these appeared a gradual spirit of encroachment, almost imper∣ceptibly deviating from the civil institutes of the English constitution, towards the establishment of a military dominion. By this new bill a power was vested in any commander in chief to revise and cor∣rect any legal sentence of a court-martial, by which the members of such a court, corresponding with
<PB N="22" REF="220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the nature of a civil jury, were rendered absolutely useless, and the commander in a great measure ab∣solute; for he had not only the power of summoning such officers as he might choose to fit on any trial, a prerogative unknown to any civil court of judica∣ture: but he was also at liberty to review and alter the sentence; so that a man was subject to two trials for the same offence, and the commander in chief was judge both of the guilt and the punish∣ment. By the final clause of this bill, the martial law was extended to all officers on half-pay; and the same argument, which had been urged against this article in the navy-bill, were now repeated and reinforced with redoubled fervour. Many reasons were offered to prove that the half-pay was allotted as a recompence for past service; and the opponents of the bill affirmed, that such an article, by aug∣menting the dependents of the crown, might be very dangerous to the constitution. On the other hand, the partisans of the ministry asserted that the half-pay was granted as a retaining fee; and that originally all those who enjoyed this indulgence, were deemed to be in actual service, consequently subject to martial law. Mr. P—, who at this time exercised the office of paymaster general with a rigour of integrity unknown to the most disinte∣rested of all his predecessors in that department es∣poused the clause in dispute, as a necessary exten∣sion of military discipline which could never be at∣tended with any bad consequence to the liberty of the nation. The remarks which he made on this occasion implied an opinion that our liberties wholly existed in dependence upon the direction of the so∣vereign, and the virtue of the army. "To that
<PB N="23" REF="230"/>
virtue, said he, we trust even at this hour, small<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> as our army is—to that virtue we must have trusted had this bill been modelled as its warmest opposers could have wished; and without this virtue, should the lords, the commons, and the people of Eng∣land intrench themselves behind parchment up to the teeth, the sword will find a passage to the vitals of the constitution." This being the case, vain, fruitless, and unnecessary, must those precautions be, which are so carefully transmitted from one session to another, in order to restrain the military power within the constitutional pale of parliament. At any rate, it cannot surely be advisable to esta∣blish such new regulations as may possibly be produc∣tive of prejudice to national liberty, unless the want of them had been proved detrimental to the ser∣vice of the public.</P>
<P>All the disputed articles of the bill being sus∣tained on the shoulders of a great majority, it was conveyed to the upper house, where it excited an∣other violent contest. Upon the question whether officers on half-pay had not been subject to martial law, the judges were consulted and divided in their sentiments. The earl of Bath declared his opinion, that the martial-law did not extend to reformed of∣ficers; and opened all the sluices of his antient elo∣quence. He admitted a case which was urged of seven officers on half pay, who, being taken in ac∣tual rebellion at Preston, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, had been executed on the spot by martial law, in consequence of the king's express order. He candidly owned, that he himself was secretary at war at that period: that he had approved of this order, and even trans∣mitted it to general Carpenter, who commanded at
<PB N="24" REF="240"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> Preston; but now his opinion was entirely changed. He observed that when the forementioned rebel∣lion first broke out, the house presented an address to the king, desiring his majesty would be pleased to employ all half-pay officers, and gratify them with whole pay; and indeed all such officers were voted on whole pay, by the house of commons. They were afterwards apprised of this vote, by an advertisement in the Gazette, and ordered to hold themselves in readiness for repairing to such places as should be appointed; and finally commanded to repair by such a day to those places, on pain of be∣ing struck off the list of half-pay. These precau∣tions would have been unnecessary had they been deemed subject to martial law; and the penalty for non-obedience would not have been merely a privation of their pensions, but they would have fallen under the punishment of death as deserters from the service. His lordship distinguished, with great propriety and precision, between a step which had been precipitately taken in a violent crisis, when the public was heated with apprehension and resent∣ment, and a solemn law concerted at leisure, during the most profound tranquillity. Notwithstanding the spirited opposition of this nobleman, and some attempts to insert additional clauses, the bill having undergone a few inconsiderable amendments, passed by virtue of a very considerable majority.</P>
<P>Immediately after the mutiny bill had passed the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for limiting the term of a sol∣dier's ser∣vice.</NOTE> lower house, another fruitless effort was made by the opposition. The danger of a standing army, on whose virtue the constitution of Great Britain seemed to depend, did not sail to alarm the minds of many who were zealously attached to the liber∣ties of their country, and gave birth to a scheme,
<PB N="25" REF="250"/>
which, if executed, would have enabled the legi∣slature<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> to establish a militia that must have an∣swered many national purposes, and acted as a con∣stitutional bulwark against the excesses and ambi∣tion of a military standing force, under the imme∣diate influence of the government. The scheme which patriotism conceived, was, in all probability, adopted by party. A motion was made, and a bill brought in, limiting the time beyond which no soldier, or non commissioned officer should be compelled to continue in the service. Had this limitation taken place, such a rotation of soldiers would have ensued among the common people, that in a few years every peasant, labourer, and inferior tradesman in the kingdom, would have understood the exercise of arms; and perhaps the people in general would have concluded, that a standing army was altogether unnecessary. A pro∣ject of this nature could not, for obvious reasons, be agreeable to the administration, and therefore the bill was rendered abortive; for, after having been twice read, it was postponed from time to time until the parliament was prorogued, and never ap∣peared in the sequel.</P>
<P>Such were the chief subjects of debate between the ministry and the opposition, composed, as we have already observed, of the prince's servants and the remains of the country party, this last being headed by lord Strange, son of the earl of Derby, and Sir Francis Dashwood; the former a noble∣man of distinguished abilities, keen, penetrating, eloquent, and sagacious; the other frank, spirited, and sensible.</P>
<P>It must be owned, however, for the honour of the ministry, that, if they carried a few unpopular
<PB N="26" REF="260"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> measures with a high hand, they seemed earnestly desirous of making amends to the nation, by pro∣moting divers regulations for the benefit and im∣provement of commerce, which actually took place in the ensuing session of parliament. One of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken with re∣spect to the Afri∣can trade.</NOTE> principal objects of this nature, which fell under their cognizance, was the trade to the coast of Guinea; a very important branch of traffic, whe∣ther considered as a market for British manufac∣tures, or as the source that supplied the English plantations with negroes. This was originally mo∣nopolized by a joint-stock company, which had from time to time derived considerable sums from the legislature, for enabling them the better to support certain forts or castles on the coast of Afri∣ca, to facilitate the commerce and protect the mer∣chants. In the sequel, however, the exclusive pri∣vilege having been judged prejudicial to the na∣tional trade, the coast was laid open to all British subjects indiscriminately, upon condition that they should pay a certain duty towards defraying the ex∣pence of the forts and factories.</P>
<P>This expedient did not answer the purposes for which it had been contrived. The separate traders, instead of receiving any benefit from the protection of the company, industriously avoided their castles, as the receptacles of tyranny and oppression. The company, whether from the misconduct or knavery of their directors, contracted such a load of debts as their stock was unable to discharge. They seemed to neglect the traffic, and allowed the cas∣tles to decay. In a word, their credit being ex∣hausted, and their creditors growing clamourous, they presented a petition to the house of commons,
<PB N="27" REF="270"/>
disclosing their distresses, and imploring such as∣sistance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> as should enable them not only to pay their debts, but also to maintain the forts in a de∣fensible condition. This petition, recommended to the house in a message from his majesty, was cor∣roborated by another in behalf of the company's creditors. Divers merchants of London, interested in the trade of Africa, and the British plantations of America, petitioned the house, that as the Afri∣can trade was of the utmost importance to the na∣tion, and could not be supported without forts and settlements, some effectual means should be spee∣dily taken for protecting and extending this va∣luable branch of commerce. A fourth was of∣fered by the merchants of Liverpool, representing, that the security and protection of the trade to Africa must always principally depend upon his majesty's ships of war, properly stationed on that coast, and seasonably relieved; and that such forts and settlements as might be judged necessary for marks of sovereignty and possession, would prove a nuisance and a burthen to the trade, should they remain in the hands of any joint-stock company, whose private interest always had been, and ever would be, found incompatible with the interest of the separate and open trader. They therefore prayed, that the said forts might either be taken into his majesty's immediate possession, and sup∣ported by the public, or committed to the mer∣chants trading on that coast, in such a manner as the house should judge expedient, without vesting in them any other advantage or right to the com∣merce, but what should be common to all his ma∣jesty's subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="280"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> This remonstrance was succeeded by another, to the same effect, from the master, wardens, assist∣ants, and commonalty of the society of merchant-adventurers within the city of Bristol.</P>
<P>All these petitions were referred to a committee appointed to deliberate on this subject; and they agreed to certain resolutions, importing, That the trade to Africa should be free and open; That the British forts and settlements on that coast ought to be maintained and put under proper direction; and, That, in order to carry on the African trade in the most beneficial manner to these kingdoms, all the British subjects trading to Africa should be united in one open company, without any joint-stock, or power to trade as a corporation. A bill was immediately founded on these resolutions, which alarmed the company to such a degree, that they had recourse to another petition, demon∣strating their right to the coast of Africa, and ex∣pressing their reliance on the justice of the house, that they should not be deprived of their property without an adequate consideration. In a few days a second address was offered by their creditors, complaining of the company's mismanagement, promising to surrender their right, as the wisdom of parliament should prescribe; praying, that their debts might be inquired into; and that the equi∣valent, to be granted for the company's possessions, might be secured and applied, in the first place, for their benefit. The commons, in consequence of this petition, ordered the company to produce a list of their debts, together with a copy of their charter, and two remonstrances which their credi∣tors had presented to them before this application
<PB N="29" REF="290"/>
to parliament. A committee of the whole house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> having deliberated on these papers and petitions, and heard the company by their counsel, resolved to give them a reasonable compensation for their charter, lands, forts, settlements, slaves, and ef∣fects, to be, in the first place, applied towards the payment of their creditors. A bill being formed accordingly, passed through the commons, and was conveyed to the upper house, where a great many objections were started; and for the present it was dropped, until a plan more exceptionable should be concerted. In the mean time their lordships addressed his majesty, That the lords commissioners for trade and plantations might be directed to pre∣pare a scheme on this subject to be laid before both houses of parliament at the beginning of next ses∣sion; That instant orders should be given for pre∣serving and securing the forts and settlements on the coast of Guinea belonging to Great Britain; and, That proper persons should be appointed to examine into the condition of those forts, as well as of the military stores, slaves, and vessels belonging to the African company, so as to make a faithful report of these particulars, with all possible expe∣dition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for im∣proving the British fishery.</NOTE> The ministry having professed an inclination, and indeed shewn a disposition, to promote and ex∣tend the commerce of the kingdom, the commons resolved to take some steps for encouraging the white fishery along the northern coast of the island, which is an inexhaustible source of wealth to our industrious neighbours the Dutch, who employ annually a great number of hands and vessels in this branch of commerce. The sensible part of
<PB N="30" REF="300"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> the British people, reflecting on this subject, plain∣ly foresaw that a fishery, under due regulations, undertaken with the protection and encourage∣ment of the legislature, would not only prove a fund of national riches, and a nursery of seamen▪ but likewise, in a great measure, prevent any future insurrections in the Highlands of Scotland, by dif∣fusing a spirit of industry among the natives of that country, who, finding it in their power to be∣come independent, on the fruits of their own la∣bour, would soon enfranchise themselves from that slavish attachment by which they had beeen so long connected with their landlords and chieftains. Accordingly a committee was appointed to deli∣berate on the state of the British fishery; and upon their report, a bill was founded for encouraging the whale fishery on the coast of Spitzbergen, by a boun∣ty of forty shillings per ton of every ship equipped for that undertaking.</P>
<P>The bill having made its way through both houses, and obtained the royal assent, the merchants in different parts of the kingdom, particularly in North Britain, began to build and fit out ships of great burthen, and peculiar structure, for the pur∣poses of that fishery, which ever since hath been carried on with equal vigour and success.</P>
<P>Divers merchants and traders of London having presented to the house of commons a petition, re∣presenting the benefits that would accrue to the community from a herring and cod fishery, esta∣blished on proper principles, and carried on with skill and integrity, this remonstrance was referred to the committee, upon whose resolutions a bill was formed; but before this could be discussed in
<PB N="31" REF="310"/>
the house, the parliament was prorogued, and of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> consequence this measure proved abortive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to open the com∣merce to Hudson's bay.</NOTE> The next proposed regulation, in favour of trade, was that of laying open the commerce of Hudson's bay, in the most northern parts of Ame∣rica, where a small monopoly maintained a few forts and settlements, and prosecuted a very ad∣vantageous fur-trade with the Indians of that con∣tinent. It was suggested, that the company had long ago enriched themselves by their exclusive privilege; that they employed no more than four annual ships; that, contrary to an express injunc∣tion in their charter, they discouraged all attempts to discover a north-west passage to the East-Indies; that they dealt cruelly and perfidiously with the poor Indians, who never traded with them, except when compelled by necessity, so that the best part of the fur-trade had devolved to the enemies of Great Britain; and that their exclusive patent re∣stricted to very narrow limits a branch of com∣merce, which might be cultivated to a prodiglous extent, as well as to the infinite advantage of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Petitions, that the trade of Hudson's bay might be laid open, were presented to the house by mer∣chants of London, Great Yarmouth, and Wolver∣hampton; and a committee was appointed to delibe∣rate upon the subject. On the other hand, the com∣pany exerted themselves in petitions, and private applications for their own preservation. The com∣mittee examined papers and records; and the re∣port was taken into consideration by the whole house. Many evidences were interrogated, and elaborate speeches made, on both sides of the ques∣tion.
<PB N="32" REF="320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> At length the majority seemed satisfied, that the traffic on the coast of Hudson's bay could not be preserved without forts and settle∣ments, which must be maintained either by an ex∣clusive company, or at the public expence; and as this was not judged a proper juncture to encum∣ber the nation with any charge of that kind, the design of dissolving the company was laid aside to a more favourable opportunity. This, however, was but an indifferent excuse, provided the trade was really capable of considerable extension: for the company, having already enriched themselves by their charter, had no right to demand an in∣demnification; and the expence of maintaining the forts, being trifling in itself, would have been am∣ply refunded by the augmentation of the na∣tional commerce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministe∣rial plan for mann∣ing the navy.</NOTE> The government had during the war, found great difficulty in pressing men for the service of the navy: a practice, which, however sanctioned by necessity, is nevertheless a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>agrant incroach∣ment on the liberty of the subject, and a violent outrage against the constitution of Great Britain. The ministry, therefore, had employed some of their agents to form a scheme for retaining in time of peace, by means of a certain allowance, a num∣ber of seamen, who should be registered for the purpose, and be ready to man a squadron upon any emergency. Such a plan, properly regulated, would have been a great advantage to commerce▪ which is always distressed by the expedient of press∣ing seamen; and, at the same time, a great secu∣rity to the kingdom in dangerous conjunctures when it may be necessary to equip an armamen

at a minute's warning. The house of commons<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> being moved upon this subject, agreed to divers resolutions, as a foundation for the bill: but the members in the opposition affecting to represent this measure in an odious light, being an imitation of the French method of registring seamen without their own consent, Mr. Pelham dropped it, as an unpopular project.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruitless motions made by the mem∣bers in the oppo∣sition.</NOTE> Information having been received, that the French intended to settle the neutral islands of St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago, in the West Indies, the nation had taken the alarm in the beginning of the year; and a motion was made in the house of commons to address his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased to give directions for laying before the house copies of the instruc∣tions given to the governors of Barbadoes for ten years last past, so far as they related to these neu∣tral islands: but whether the minister was con∣scious of a neglect in this particular, or thought such inquiries trenched upon the prerogative, he opposed the motion with all his might; and, after some debate, the previous question passed in the negative.</P>
<P>This was also the fate of another motion made by the earl of E—t for an address, intreating his majesty would submit to the inspection of the house all the proposals of peace that had been made by the French king, since the year which preceded the last rebellion, to that in which the definitive treaty was concluded at Aix-la Chapelle. This they pro∣posed as a previous step to the parliament's form∣ing any opinion concerning the utility or necessity of the peace which had been established. Violent
<PB N="34" REF="340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> debates ensued, in which the opposition was as much excelled in oratory as out-numbered in votes.</P>
<P>Such were the material transactions of this ses∣sion, which in the month of June was closed as usual with a speech from the throne; in which his majesty signified his hope, that the parliament, at their next meeting, would be able to perfect what they had now begun for advancing the trade and navigation of the kingdom. He likewise expressed his satisfaction in seeing public credit flourish at the end of an expensive war; and recommended unanimity, as the surest bulwark of national se∣curity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Severities exercised uponsome students at Oxford.</NOTE> While the ministry, on some occasions, exhibited all the external signs of moderation and good hu∣mour; they, on others, manifested a spirit of jea∣lousy and resentment, which seems to have been childish and illiberal. Two or three young riotous students at Oxford, trained up in prejudice, and heated with intemperance, uttered some expressions over their cups, importing their attachment to the family of the Pretender. The report of this indis∣cretion was industriously circulated by certain worthless individuals, who, having no reliance on their own intrinsic merit, hoped to distinguish themselves as the tools of party, and to obtain fa∣vour with the ministry by acting as volunteers in the infamous practice of information. Though nei∣ther the age, rank, nor connections of the delin∣quents, were such as ought to have attracted the no∣tice of the public, the vice-chancellor, heads of houses, and proctors of the university, knowing the invidious scrutiny to which their conduct was sub∣jected,

thought proper to publish a declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>48.</NOTE> signifying their abhorrence of all seditious prac∣tices; importing their determined resolution to punish all offenders to the utmost severity and ri∣gour of the statutes; and containing peremptory orders for the regulation of the university. Not∣withstanding these wise and salutary precautions, the three boys, who, in the heat of their intoxica∣tion, had drank to the Pretender's health, were taken into custody by a messenger of state. Two of them being tried in the court of King's Bench, and found guilty, were sentenced to walk through the courts of Westminster, with an account of their crime fixed to their foreheads; to pay a fine of five nobles each; to be imprisoned for two years, and find security for their good behaviour for the term of seven years after their enlargement. Many people thought they saw the proceedings of the star-chamber revived in the severity of this punish∣ment.</P>
<P>The administration, not yet satisfied with the vengeance which had been taken on these three striplings, seemed determined to stigmatize the university to which they belonged. The cry of Jacobitism was loudly trumpeted against the whole community. The address of the university, con∣gratulating his majesty on the establishment of the peace, was rejected with disdain: an attempt was made to subject their statutes to the inspection of the king's council; but this rule being argued in the court of King's Bench, was dismissed, in con∣sequence of the opinions given by the judges. Finally, the same tribunal granted an information against Dr. Purnel, the vice-chancellor, for his
<PB N="36" REF="360"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The duke of New∣castle chosen chancel∣lor of the university of Cam∣bridge.</NOTE> In proportion as Oxford declined, her sister uni∣versity rose in the favour of the administration, which she at this period cultivated by an extraor∣dinary mark of complaisance and attachment. The dignity of chancellor in that university being va∣cated by the death of the duke of Somerset, the nation in general seemed to think it would natu∣rally devolve upon the prince of Wales, as a com∣pliment at all times due to that rank; but more especially to the present heir aparent, who had eminently distinguished himself by the virtues of a patriot and a prince. He had even pleased him∣self with the hope of receiving this mark of at∣tachment from a seminary, for which he enter∣tained a particular regard. But the ruling mem∣bers, seeing no immediate prospect of advantage in glorifying even a prince, who was at variance with the ministry, wisely turned their eyes upon the illustrious character of the duke of Newcastle, whom they elected without opposition, and instal∣led with great magnificence; learning, poetry, and eloquence, joining their efforts in celebrating the shining virtues and extraordinary talents of their new patron.</P>

Many in∣dividuals, animated by the fumes of inebriation, now loudly extolled that cause which they durst not avow when it required their open approbation and assistance; and, though they industriously avoided exposing their lives and fortunes to the chance of war, in promoting their favourite inte∣rest when there was a possibility of success, they betrayed no apprehension in celebrating the me∣mory of its last effort, amidst the tumult of a riot and the clamours of intemperance.</P>

<P>Many disputes had arisen between the subjects of England and the French, concerning the limits of Nova Scotia, which no treaty had as yet pro∣perly ascertained. A fort had been raised, and a small garrison maintained, by the king of Great Britain, at a part of this very country, called Anna∣polis Royal, to overawe the French neutrals settled in the neighbourhood: but this did not answer the purpose for which it was intended. Upon every rupture or dispute between the two crowns, these planters, forgetting their neutrality, intrigued with the Indians, communicated intelligence to their own countrymen settled at St. John's and Cape Breton, and did all the ill offices their hatred could suggest against the colonies and subjects of Great Britain.</P>
<P>A scheme was now formed for making a new establishment on the same peninsula, which should further confirm and extend the property and do∣minion of the crown of Great Britain in that large tract of country, clear the uncultivated grounds, constitute communities, diffuse the benefits of po∣pulation and agriculture, and improve the fishery of that coast, which might be rendered a new source of wealth and commerce to Old England.

The particulars of the plan, being duly consi∣dered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> was laid before his majesty, who approved of the design, and referred the execution of it to the board of trade and plantations, over which the earl of Hallifax presided. This nobleman, endued by nature with an excellent capacity, which had been diligently and judiciously cultivated, animated with liberal sentiments, and fired with an eager spirit of patriotism, adopted the plan with the most generous ardour, and cherished the infant colony with paternal affection.</P>
<P>The commissioners for trade and plantations immediately advertised, under the sanction of his majesty's authority, That proper encouragement would be given to such of the officers and private men, lately dismissed from the land and sea▪service, as were willing to settle with or without families in the province of Nova Scotia: That the fee∣simple, or perpetual property, of fifty acres of land should be granted to every private soldier or sea∣man, free from the payment of any quit▪rents or taxes for the term of ten years; at the expiration of which no person should pay more than one shil∣ling per annum for every fifty acres so granted: That, over and above these fifty, each person should receive a grant of ten acres for every indivi∣dual, including women and children, of which his family should consist; and further grants should be made to them as the number should increase, and in proportion as they should manifest their abilities in agriculture: That every officer, under the rank of ensign in the land-service, or lieutenant in the navy, should be gratified with fourscore acres on the same conditions: That two hundred acres
<PB N="40" REF="410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> should be bestowed upon ensigns, three hundred upon lieutenants, four hundred upon captains, and six hundred on every officer above that degree, with proportionable considerations for the number and increase of every family: That the lands should be parcelled out as soon as possible after the arrival of the colonists, and a civil government established; in consequence of which they should enjoy all the liberties and privileges of British sub∣jects with proper security and protection: That the settlers, with their families, should be con∣veyed to Nova Scotia, and maintained for twelve months after their arrival at the expence of the government; which would also supply them with arms and ammunition, as far as should be judged necessary for their defence, with proper materials and utensils for clearing and cultivating their lands, erecting habitations, exercising the fishery, and such other purposes as should be judged ne∣cessary for their support.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the scheme for found∣ing the town of Hallifax.</NOTE> The scheme was so feasible, and the encourage∣ment so inviting, that in a little time about four thousand adventurers, with their families, were en∣tered, according to the directions of the board of trade. In the beginning of May they set sail from England, under the command of colonel Corn∣wallis, whom the king had appointed their go∣vernor. Towards the latter end of June they ar∣rived at the place of their destination, which was the harbour of Chebuctou, on the sea-coast of the peninsula, about midway between Cape Cançeau and Cape Sable. It is one of the most secure and commodious havens in the whole world, and well situated for the fishery: but the climate is cold,
<PB N="41" REF="420"/>
the soil barren, and the whole country covered with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> woods of birch, fir, pine, and some oak, unfit for the purposes of timber; but at the same time ex∣tremely difficult to remove and extirpate.</P>
<P>Governor Cornwallis no sooner arrived in this harbour, than he was joined by two regiments of infantry from Cape Breton, and a company of rangers from Annapolis. Then he pitched upon a spot for the settlement, and employed his people in clearing the ground for laying the foundations of a town; but some inconveniencies being disco∣vered in this situation, he chose another to the northward, hard by the harbour, on an easy ascent that commands a prospect of the whole peninsula, and is well supplied with rivulets of fresh and whol∣some water. Here, on a regular plan, he began to build a town, to which he gave the name of Hallifax, in honour of the nobleman who had the greatest share in founding the colony; and before the approach of winter above three hundred com∣fortable wooden houses were built, the whole being surrounded by a strong pallisade.</P>
<P>This colony, however, has by no means an∣swered the sanguine expectations of the projectors; for, notwithstanding the ardour with which the in∣terests of it were promoted by its noble patron, and the repeated indulgence it has reaped from the bounty of the legislature, the inhabitants have made little or no progress in agriculture: the fishery is altogether neglected, and the settlement entirely subsists on the sums expended by the indi∣viduals of the army and navy, whose duty obliges them to reside in this part of North-America.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> The establishment of such a powerful colony in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Frenchat∣tempt to settle the island of Tobago.</NOTE> Nova Scotia could not fail of giving umbrage to the French in that neighbourhood, who, though they did not think proper to promulgate their jea∣lousy and disgust, nevertheless employed their emis∣saries clandestinely in stimulating and exciting the Indians to harrass the colonists with hostilities, in such a manner as should effectually hinder them from extending their plantations, and perhaps in∣duce them to abandon the settlement. Nor was this the only part of America in which the French court countenanced such perfidious practices. More than ever convinced of the importance of a consi∣derable navy, and an extensive plantation-trade, they not only exerted uncommon industry in re∣establishing their marine, which had suffered so se∣verely during the war; but they resolved, if possible, to extend their plantations in the West-Indies, by settling the neutral islands, which we have already mentioned.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year the governor of Barbadoes, having received intelligence that the French had begun to settle the island of Tobago, sent thither captain Tyrrel in a frigate to learn the particulars; and that officer found above three hun∣dred men already landed, secured by two batteries and two ships of war, and in daily expectation of a further reinforcement from the marquis de Caylus, governor of Martinique; who had published an ordonnance, authorizing the subjects of the French king to settle the island of Tobago, and promising to defend them from the attempts of all their ene∣mies. This assurance was in answer to a procla∣mation issued by Mr. Greenville, governor of Bar∣badoes,
<PB N="43" REF="440"/>
and stuck up in different parts of the island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> commanding all the inhabitants to remove in thirty days, on pain of undergoing military execution.</P>
<P>Captain Tyrrel, with a spirit that became a com∣mander in the British navy, gave the French offi∣cers to understand, that his most christian majesty had no right to settle the island, which was declared neutral by treaties; and that, if they would not desist, he should be obliged to employ force in driving them from their new settlement. Night coming on, and Mr. Tyrrel's ship falling to lee∣ward, the two French captains seized that opportu∣nity of sailing to Martinique; and the next day the English commander returned to Barbadoes, having no power to commit hostilities.</P>
<P>These tidings, with a copy of the French gover∣nor's ordonnance, were no sooner transmitted to the ministry than they dispatched a courier to the English envoy at Paris, with directions to make representations to the court of Versailles on this sub∣ject. The ministry of France, knowing they were in no condition to support the consequences of an immediate rupture, and understanding how much the merchants and people of Great-Britain were alarmed and incensed at their attempts to possess these islands, thought proper to disown the pro∣ceedings of the marquis de Caylus, and to grant the satisfaction that was demanded, by sending him orders to discontinue the settlement, and evacuate the island of Tobago. At the same time, how∣ever, that the court of Versailles made this sacri∣fice for the satisfaction of England, the marquis de Puysieux, the French minister, observed to the English resident, that France was undoubtedly in
<PB N="44" REF="450"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> possession of that island towards the middle of the last century. He ought in candour to have added, That although Louis XIV. made a conquest of this island from the Hollanders, during his war with that republic, it was restored to them by the treaty of Nimeguen; and since that time France could not have the least shadow of a claim to number it among her settlements.</P>
<P>It was before this answer could be obtained from the court of Versailles, that the motion, of which we have already taken notice, was made in the house of commons, relating to the subject of the neutral islands; a motion discouraged by the court, and defeated by the majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoic∣ings for thepeace.</NOTE> The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was celebrated by fire-works, illuminations, and rejoicings, in which the English, French, and Dutch, seemed to display a spirit of emulation, in point of taste and magnificence; and, in all probability, these three powers were sincerely pleased at the cessation of the war. England enjoyed a respite from into∣lerable supplies, exorbitant insurance, and inter∣rupted commerce: Holland was delivered from the brink of a French invasion; and France had obtained a breathing time for re-establishing her naval power, exerting that spirit of intrigue by dint of which she hath often embroiled her neigh∣bours, and executing plans of insensible encroach∣ment, which might prove more advantageous than the progress of open hostilities.</P>
<P>In the affair of Tobago the French king had manifested his inclination to avoid immediate dis∣putes with England; and he exhibited another proof of the same disposition in his behaviour to
<PB N="45" REF="460"/>
the prince pretender, who had excited such a dan∣gerous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> rebellion in the island of Great-Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre∣tender's eldest son arrested at Paris▪</NOTE> Among those princes and powers who excepted against different articles of the treaty at Aix-la-Chapelle, the Chevalier de St. George, foreseeing that none of the plenipotentiaries would receive his protest, employed his agents to fix it up in the public places of Aix-la-Chapelle; a precaution of very little service to his cause, which all the states of Christendom seemed now to have abandoned. So little was the interest of his family considered in this negotiation, that the contracting powers agreed, without reserve, to a literal insertion of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance; by which it was stipulated, That neither the pretender nor any of his descendants should be allowed to reside within the territories belonging to any of the sub∣scribing parties. At the same time the plenipo∣tentiaries of France promised to those of Great Britain, that prince Edward should be immediately obliged to quit the dominions of his most christian majesty. Notice of this agreement was accord∣ingly given by the court of Versailles to the young adventurer; and as he had declared he would never return to Italy, Mons. de Courteille, the French envoy to the cantons of Switzerland, was directed by his sovereign to demand an asylum for prince Edward in the city of Fribourg. The re∣gency having complied in this particular with the earnest request of his most christian majesty, Mr. Burnaby, the British minister to the Helvetic Body, took the alarm, and presented the magistracy of Fribourg with a remonstrance, couched in such terms as gave offence to that regency, and drew
<PB N="46" REF="470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> upon him a severe answer. In vain had the French king exerted his influence in procuring this retreat for the young pretender, who, being pressed with repeated messages to withdraw, per∣sisted in refusing to quit the place, to which he had been so cordially invited by his cousin the king of France; and where (he said) that monarch had solemnly promised, on the word of a king, that he would never forsake him in his distress, nor aban∣don the interests of his family.</P>
<P>Louis was not a little perplexed at this obstinacy of prince Edward, which was the more vexatious as that youth appeared to be the darling of the Parisians; who not only admired him for his ac∣complishments, and pitied him for his sufferings, but also revered him as a young hero lineally de∣scended from their renowned fourth Henry.</P>
<P>At length the two English noblemen arriving at Paris, as hostages for performance of the treaty, and seeing him appear at all public spectacles, complained of this circumstance as an insult offered to their sovereign, and even as an infringement of the treaty so lately concluded. The French king, after some hesitation between punctilio and convenience, resolved to employ violence upon the person of this troublesome stranger, since milder remonstrances had not been able to influence his conduct: but this resolution was not taken till the return of a courier whom he dispatched to the Chevalier de St. George; who, being thus in∣formed of his son's deportment, wrote a letter to him, laying strong injunctions upon him to yield to the necessity of the times, and acquiesce with a good grace in the stipulations which his cousin of
<PB N="47" REF="480"/>
France had found it necessary to subscribe, for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> interest of his realm.</P>
<P>Edward, far from complying with this advice and injunction, signified his resolution to remain in Paris; and even declared, that he would pistol any man who should presume to lay violent hands on his person. In consequence of this bold decla∣ration, an extraordinary council was held at Ver∣sailles, where it was determined to arrest him with∣out further delay, and the whole plan of this en∣terprize was finally adjusted. The same evening, the prince entering the narrow lane that leads to the opera, the barrier was immediately shut, and the serjeant of the guard called "To arms." Then monsieur de Vaudreuil, exempt of the French guards, advancing to Edward, "Prince, (said he) I ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est you in the king's name, by virtue of this order." At that instant he was surrounded by four grenadiers, in order to prevent any mischief he might have done with a case of pocket-pistols which he always carried about with him; and a guard was placed on all the avenues and doors of the opera-house, left any tumult should have ensued, among the populace. These precautions being taken, Vaudreuil, with an escorte, conducted the prisoner through the garden of the Palais Royal to a house where the duke de Biron waited, with a coach and six, to convey him to the castle of Vincennes, whi∣ther he was immediately accompanied by a detach∣ment from the regiment of French guards, under the command of that nobleman. He had not re∣mained above three days in this confinement when he gave the French ministry to understand, that he would conform himself to the king's intentions;
<PB N="48" REF="490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> and was immediately enlarged, upon giving his word and honour that he would, without delay, re∣tire from the dominions of France. Accordingly he set out in four days from Fountainbleau, at∣tended by three officers, who conducted him as far as Pont-Beauvoisin on the frontiers, where they took their leave of him, and returned to Versailles. He proceeded for some time in the road to Cham∣berri; but soon returned into the French domi∣nions, and, passing through Dauphine, repaired to Avignon, where he was received with extraordi∣nary honours by the pope's legate.</P>
<P>In the mean time his arrest excited great mur∣murings at Paris; the inhabitants of which blamed, without scruple, their king's conduct in this in∣stance, as a scandalous breach of hospitality, as well as a mean proof of condescension to the king of England; and many severe pasquinades, relating to this transaction, were fixed up in the most pub∣lic places of that metropolis.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appear∣ance of a rupture between Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiaand Sweden.</NOTE> Although peace was now re-established among the principal powers of the continent, yet another storm seemed ready to burst upon the northern parts of Europe, in a fresh rupture between Russia and Sweden. Whether the Czarina had actually obtained information that the French faction me∣ditated some revolution of government at Stock∣holm, or she wanted a pretence for annexing Fin∣land to her empire, certain it is, she affected to apprehend that the prince-successor of Sweden waited only for the decease of the reigning king, who was very old and infirm, to change the form of government, and resume that absolute authority which some of the monarchs his predecessors had
<PB N="49" REF="500"/>
enjoyed. She seemed to think, that a prince thus<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> vested with arbitrary power, and guided by the counsels of France and Prussia, with which Sweden had lately engaged in close alliance, might become a very troublesome and dangerous neighbour to her in the Baltic: she therefore recruited her ar∣mies, repaired her fortifications, filled her maga∣zines, ordered a strong body of troops to advance towards the frontiers of Finland, and declared, in plain terms to the court of Stockholm, That if any step should be taken to alter the government, which she had bound herself by treaty to maintain, her troops should enter the territory of Sweden, and she would act up to the spirit of her engage∣ments. The Swedish ministry, alarmed at these peremptory proceedings, had recourse to their al∣lies; and, in the mean time, made repeated decla∣rations to the court of Petersburg, That there was no design to make the least innovation in the na∣ture of their established government: but little or no regard being paid to these representations, they began to put the kingdom in a posture of de∣fence; and the old king gave the Czarina to un∣derstand▪ That if, notwithstanding the satisfaction he had offered, her forces should pass the frontiers of Finland, he would consider their march as an hostile invasion, and employ the means which God had put in his power for the defence of his domi∣nions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Interposi∣tion of his Prussian majesty.</NOTE> This declaration, in all probability, did not pro∣duce such effect as did the interposition of his Prus∣sian majesty, the most enterprising prince of his time, at the head of one hundred and fifty thou∣sand of the best troops that Germany ever trained.
<PB N="56" REF="510"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> Perhaps he was not sorry that the empress of Mus∣covy furnished him with a plausible pretence for maintaining such a formidable army, after the peace of Europe had been ascertained by a formal treaty, and all the surrounding states had dimi∣nished the number of their forces. He now wrote a letter to his uncle the king of Great Britain, complaining of the insults and menaces which had been offered by the Czarina to Sweden; declaring; that he was bound by a defensive alliance, to which France had acceded, to defend the government at present established in Sweden; and that he would not sit still and tamely see that kingdom attacked by any power whatsoever, without acting up to his engagements: finally, he intreated his Britannic majesty to interpose his good offices, in conjunction with France and him, to compromise the disputes which threatened to embroil the northern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>By this time the Russian army had approached the frontiers of Finland: the Swedes had assembled their troops, replenished their magazines, and re∣paired their marine; and the king of Denmark, jealous of the Czarina's designs, with regard to the dutchy of Sleswic, which was contested with him by the prince successor of Russia, kept his army and navy on the most respectable footing.</P>
<P>At this critical juncture the courts of London, Versailles, and Berlin, co-operated so effectually by remonstrances and declarations at Petersburg and Stockholm, that the empress of Russia thought proper to own herself satisfied, and all those clouds of trouble were immediately dispersed. Yet, in all probability, her real aim was disappointed; and,
<PB N="51" REF="520"/>
however she might dissemble her sentiments, she<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> never heartily forgave the king of Prussia for the share he had in this transaction. That monarch, without relaxing in his attention to the support of a very formidable military power, exerted very extraordinary endeavours in cultivating the civil interests of his country. He reformed the laws of Brandenburg, and rescued the administration of justice from the frauds of chicanery. He en∣couraged the arts of agriculture and manufacture; and even laid the foundation of naval commerce▪ by establishing an East India company in the port of Embden.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Internal measures taken by the French ministry.</NOTE> Nor did the French ministry neglect any mea∣sure that might contribute to repair the damage which the kingdom had sustained in the course of the war. One half of the army was disbanded: the severe imposition of the tenth penny was sus∣pended by the king's edict; a scheme of oeconomy proposed, with respect to the finances; and the ut∣most diligence used in procuring materials, as well as workmen, for ship building, that the navy of France might speedily retrieve its former impor∣tance.</P>
<P>In the midst of these truly patriotic schemes, the court of Versailles betrayed a littleness of genius, and a spirit of tyranny, joined to fanaticism, in quar∣relling with the parliament about superstitious forms of religion. The sacraments had been denied to a certain person on his death-bed, because he refused to subscribe the bull Unigenitus. The nephew of the defunct preferred a complaint to the parlia∣ment, whose province it was to take cognizance of the affair: a deputation of that body attended the
<PB N="52" REF="530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> king with the report of their resolutions; and his majesty commanded them to suspend all proceed∣ings relating to a matter of such consequence, con∣cerning which he would take an opportunity of signifying his royal pleasure. This interposition was the source of disputes between the crown and parliament, which had like to have filled the whole kingdom with intestine troubles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of divers European powers.</NOTE> At Vienna the Empress queen was not more sollicitous in promoting the trade and internal manufactures of her dominions, by sumptuary re∣gulations, necessary restrictions on foreign super∣fluities, and proper encouragements of commerce, by opening her ports in the Adriatic, than she was careful and provident in reforming the oeconomy of her finances, maintaining a respectable body of forces, and guarding, by defensive alliances, against the enterprizes of his Prussian majesty, on whose military power she looked with jealousy and dis∣trust.</P>
<P>In Holland all the authority and influence of the Stadtholder were scarce sufficient to allay the ferments excited among the people, by the provi∣sional taxation which had succeeded the abolition of the pachters, and was indeed very grievous to the subject. As this was no more than a tempo∣rary expedient, the prince of Orange proposed a more equitable plan, which was approved by the States, and established with great difficulty.</P>
<P>In Italy the system of politics seemed to change its complexion. The king of Sardinia effected a match between one of the infantas of Spain and the prince of Piedmont; and whether irritated by the conduct of the Austrians in the last war, or
<PB N="53" REF="540"/>
apprehensive of such a powerful neighbour in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> M▪lanese, he engaged with the kings of France and Spain in a defensive alliance, comprehending the king of the Two Sicilies, the republic of Ge∣noa, and the dukes of Modena and Parma.</P>
<P>His most Catholic Majesty, sincere'y disposed to cultivate the arts of peace, and encourage every measure that could contribute to the advantage of his country, was no sooner released from the em∣barrassmen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of war, than he began to execute plans of internal oeconomy; to reduce unnecessary pen∣sions, discharge the debts contracted in the war, replenish his arsenals, augment his navy, promote manufactures, and encourage an active commerce by sea, the benefits of which the kingdom of Spain had not known since the first discovery and con∣quest of the West Indies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insolence of the Barbary consairs.</NOTE> The preparations for refitting and increasing the navy of Spain were carried on with such extraor∣dinary vigour, that other nations believed an ex∣pedition was intended against the consairs of Al∣giers, who had for some time grievously infested the trade and coasts of the Mediterranean. The exist∣ence of this and other predatory republics, which intirely subsist upon piracy and rapine, petty states of barbarous ruffians, maintained, as it were, in the midst of powerful nations, which they insult with impunity, and of which they even exact an annual contribution, is a flagrant reproach upon Christen∣dom; a reproach the greater, as it is founded upon a low, selsish, illiberal maxim of policy.</P>
<P>All the powers that border on the Mediterra∣nean, except France and Tuscany, are at perpetual war with the Moors of Barbary, and, for that rea∣son,
<PB N="54" REF="550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> obliged to employ foreign ships for the trans∣portation of their merchandize. This employ∣ment naturally devolves to those nations whose ves∣sels are in no danger from the depredations of the Barbarians; namely, the subjects of the Maritime Powers, who, for this puny advantage, not only tolerate the piratical states of Barbary, but even supply them with arms and ammunition, sollicit their passes, and purchase their forbearance with annual presents, which are, in effect, equivalent to a tribute: whereas, by one vigorous exertion of their power, they might destroy all their ships, lay their towns in ashes, and totally extirpate those pernicious broods of desperate banditti. Even all the condescension of those who disgrace themselves with the title of allies to these miscreants, is not al∣ways sufficient to restrain them from acts of cru∣elty and rapine.</P>
<P>At this very period four cruisers from Algiers made a capture of an English packet-boat, in her voyage from Lisbon, and conveyed her to their city, where she was plundered of money and effects to the amount of one hundred thousand pounds, and afterwards dismissed. In consequence of this outrage, commodore Keppel was sent with seven ships of war to demand satisfaction, as well as to compromise certain differences which had arisen on account of arrears claimed of the English by the dey of Algiers. The Musselman frankly owned, that the money, having been divided among the captors, could not possibly be refunded. The com∣modore returned to Gibraltar; and, in the sequel, an Algerine ambassador arrived at London, with some presents of wild beasts for his Britannick ma∣jesty.
<PB N="55" REF="560"/>
This transaction was succeeded by another<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> injurious affront, offered by the governor or al∣cayde of Tetuan to Mr. Latton, an English am∣bassador, sent thither to redeem the British sub∣jects, who had been many years enslaved in the do∣minions of the king of Morocco.</P>
<P>A revolution having lately happened in this em∣pire, Muley Abdallah, the reigning ruffian, in∣sisted upon the ambassador's paying a pretended ballance for the ransom of the captives, as well as depositing a considerable sum, which had already been paid to a deceased bashaw; alledging, that as he (the emperor) received no part of it, the pay∣ment was illegal. Mr. Latton refusing to comply with this arbitrary demand, his house was sur∣rounded by a detachment of soldiers, who violently dragged his secretary from his presence, and threw him into a dismal subterranean dungeon, where he continued twenty days. The English slaves, to the number of twenty-seven, were condemned to the same fate: the ambassador himself was de∣graded from his character, deprived of his allow∣ance, and sequestered from all communication. All the letters directed to him were intercepted, and interpreted to the alcayde: two negro-porters were intrusted with the keys of all his apartments, and a couple of soldiers posted at his chamber∣door: nay, this Moorish governor threatened to load him with irons, and violently seized part of the presents designed by his Britannic majesty for the emperor. Finally, finding that neither Mr. Latton nor the governor of Gibraltar, to whom he had written, would deposit the money, without fresh instructions from the court of London, the
<PB N="56" REF="570"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> Barbarian thought proper to relax his severity: the prisoners were enlarged, the restrictions re∣moved from the person of the ambassador, and, after all these indignities offered to the honour of the British nation, the ballance was paid, and the affair quietly adjusted.</P>
<P>Britain, mean while, was altogether barren of events which might deserve a place in a general history. Commerce and manufacture flourished again, to such a degree of encrease as had never been known in the island: but this advantage was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distur∣bances in England.</NOTE> attended with an irresistible tide of luxury and ex∣cess, which flowed through all degrees of the people, breaking down all the mounds of civil po∣lity, and opening a way for licence and immorality. The highways were infested with rapine and assassi∣nation; the cities teemed with the brutal votaries of lewdness, intemperance, and profligacy; and the whole land was overspread with a succession of tumult, riot, and insurrection, excited in different parts of the kingdom by the erection of new turn∣pikes, which the legislature judged necessary for the convenience of inland carriage. In order to quell these disturbances, rcourse was had to the military power: several individuals were slain, and some were executed as examples. This was, at best, but a violent remedy, which ought never to be applied among a free people, except in cases of the utmost emergency; and these can hardly ever happen in a country governed by good laws, punc∣tually administred: for there must be some funda∣mental flaw in that constitution, which the power of civil magistracy cannot preserve from anarchy and internal dissolution.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="580"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> In the month of November the session of parlia∣ment was opened, with a speech from the throne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of parlia∣ment opened.</NOTE> in which his majesty expressed a particular pleasure in meeting them at a time, when the perfect re∣establishment of a general peace had restored to his people the blessings of quiet and tranquillity. He said, the good effects of these already appeared in the flourishing condition of national commerce, and in the rise of public credit, which were the foundations of strength and prosperity to these king∣doms. He declared, That, during the summer, he had used every opportunity of cementing and securing the peace; That it was his firm resolu∣tion to do every thing in his power for the preser∣vation of it, and religiously adhere to the engage∣ments into which he had entered. Finally, he took notice of the good disposition he had found in the other contracting parties to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, to cherish the public tranquillity of Europe: and he earnestly recommended to the two houses the maintenance of a strong naval power, as the bulwark of national security. When the motion was made for an address of thanks in the house of commons, the first paragraph of his majesty's speech furnished the opposition with a handle to declaim against the late treaty. Sir John Hynd Cotton observed, That the peace could not be properly stiled compleat, as nothing had been stipulated with respect to the article of "no search;" alluding to the interruption our commerce had sustained from the Spaniards in the West-In∣dies: a stipulation, without which both houses of parliament had formerly voted that there should be no peace with that kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> In the present conjuncture of affairs, such an ob∣jection savoured rather of party than of patriotism; and indeed Sir John declared, that the remarks he made upon this occasion were rather in discharge of the duty he owed to his country, than in hope of seeing his sentiments espoused by the majority.</P>
<P>Some sharp altercation was used in the debate which arose on this subject; and many severe in∣vectives were levelled at those who negotiated, as well as those who approved and confirmed the treaty. But Mr. Pelham, who sustained the whole weight of the debate on the side of the administra∣tion, answered every objection with equal candour and ability: and if he failed in proving that the terms of peace were as favourable as could be ex∣pected, considering the unfortunate events of the war, and the situation of the contending powers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at least demonstrated, that it would be the in∣terest of the kingdom to acquiesce for the present in the treaty which had been concluded, and en∣deavour to remedy its imperfections by subsequent conventions, amicably opened among those powers between whom any cause of dispute remained. With respect to the vote of both houses, men∣tioned by Sir John Hynd Cotton, he declared that he had never approved of that step, when it was first taken; or if he had, times and circumstances, which could not be foreseen, would have justified his deviating from it in the re-establishment of peace. He reminded them, that a parliament of Great Britain had once voted "no peace, while any part of the West Indies should remain in pos∣session of the Spanish king," yet a train of inci∣dents, which they could not possibly foresee, after∣wards
<PB N="59" REF="600"/>
rendered it expedient to adopt a peace, with∣out<NOTE PLACE="marg">An, 1749.</NOTE> insisting upon the accomplishment of that con∣dition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Subjects of debate.</NOTE> In a word, we must own, that, in the majority of debates excited in the course of this session, the ministry derived their triumphs from the force of reason, as well as from the weight of influence. We shall always, however, except the efforts that were made for reducing the number of land-forces to fifteen thousand, and maintaining a greater number of seamen than the ministry proposed. On these constitutional points the earl of Egmont, and the other chiefs of the opposition, expatiated with all the energy of eloquence; which, however, was frustrated by the power of superior number. Ten thousand seamen were voted for the service of the ensuing year, notwithstanding his majesty's injunc∣tion to maintain a considerable navy; and the number of land-forces continued at eighteen thou∣sand eight hundred and fifty-seven. The sums granted for making good his majesty's engage∣ments with the electors of Bavaria and Mentz, and the duke of Brunswic-Wolfenbuttle, amounted to fifty-three thousand two hundred and twenty-five pounds sterling. The services done by the colo∣nies in North America, during the war, were gra∣tified with the sum of one hundred twenty-two thousand two hundred forty-six pounds. The ex∣pence incurred by the new colony of Nova Scotia exceeded seventy-six thousand pounds. A small sum was voted for the improvemont of Georgia; and ten thousand pounds were granted towards the support of the British forts and settlements on the coast of Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> The sum total granted in this session arose to four millions one hundred forty-one thousand six-hundred sixty-one pounds nine shillings and eleven-pence half penny, to be raised by the land tax, at three shillings in the pound; the malt, and other duties, the surplus of divers impositions remaining in the Bank and Exchequer; one million by annui∣ties, at three per cent▪ charged on the sinking fund, until redeemed by parliament; and nine hundred thousand pounds out of the excess or overplus of monies denominated the sinking fund.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme for re∣ducing the inte∣rest of the national debt.</NOTE> But the capital measure, which distinguished this session of parliament, was the reduction of the interest on the public funds; a scheme which was planned and executed by the minister, without any national disturbance or disquiet, to the astonishment of all Europe; the different nations of which could not comprehend how it would be possible for the government, at the close of a long expensive war, which had so considerably drained the country, and augmented the enormous burthen of a national debt, to find money for paying off such of the public creditors as might choose to receive their principal, rather than submit to a reduction of the interest. It was not very much for the honour of the oppo∣sition, that some of its leading members endea∣voured to impede this great machine of civil oeco∣nomy, by taking opportunities of affirming in par∣liament, in opposition to his majesty's speech, that the nation, far from being in a flourishing condi∣tion, was almost intirely exhausted; that com∣merce drooped and declined; that public credit stood tottering on the brink of ruin; and that all the treaties lately concluded among the different
<PB N="61" REF="620"/>
powers of Europe, were, in effect, disadvantageous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> and prejudicial to the interests of Great Britain. In answer to these assertions, Mr. Pelham under∣took to prove, from the register of exports and im∣ports, that the commerce of the kingdom was more extensive at this than at any former period; and that the public credit was strong enough to admit of an experiment, which he would not pre∣sume to hazard, except upon a moral certainty of its being firmly rooted, beyond the power of acci∣dent and faction to shake or overturn. He de∣clared, that his design of reducing the interest upon the funds, was the result of the love he bore his country, and an opinion that it was the duty of the servants of the crown to ease the burthens of the people. He said, he had conferred on this subject with persons of the most approved know∣ledge, and undoubted experience; and chose to promulgate the method proposed for alleviating the load of the national debt, that the public, in knowing the particulars of the scheme, might have time to consider them at leisure, and start such ob∣jections as should occur to their reflection, before it might be too late to adopt amendments. He observed, that nothing could more clearly demon∣strate the vigour of public credit, and the aug∣mentation of national commerce, than the price of stock, which had within three years risen to a very considerable increase; and the duties on im∣ports, which in nine months had added one million to the sinking fond, notwithstanding a very extra∣ordinary sum which had been payed as bounties for exported corn. He expressed great tenderness and regard for the interests of those who had advanced
<PB N="62" REF="630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> their money for the service of the government; declaring that his aim was to contrive a fair, ho∣nest, and equitable method for lessening the na∣tional incumbrances, by lowering the interest, con∣formable to parliamentary faith, and agreeable to the rules of eternal justice. His plan was accord∣ingly communicated, canvassed, and approved in the house of commons, and an act passed for re∣ducing the interest of the funds which constitute the interest of the national debt.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bill passes through both houses.</NOTE> The resolutions of the commons on this head were printed by authority in the London Gazette, importing, That those who were, or should be, proprietors of any part of the public debt, re∣deemable by law, incurred before Michaelmas, in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty∣nine, carrying an interest of four per centum per annum, who should, on or before the twenty-eighth day of February in that year, subscribe their names, signifying their consent to accept of an in∣terest of three pounds per centum, to commence from the twenty-fifth day of December in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, subject to the same provisions, notices and clauses, of re∣demption, to which their respective sums, at four per centum, were then liable; should, in lieu of their present interest, be intitled to four per cen∣tum, till the twenty fifth day of December in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty; and after that day, to three pounds ten shillings per centum per annum, till the twenty-fifth day of De∣cember one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven; and no part of that debt, except what was due to the East India company, should be redeem∣able

<P>All the duties appropriated to the payment of the interest were still continued, and the surplus of these incorporated with the sinking fund for the discharge of the principal.

<P>In pursuance of this act, for the reduction of the interest, the greater part of the creditors com∣plied with the terms proposed, and subscribed their respective annuities before the end of February; but the three great companies at first kept aloof, and refused to subscribe any part of their capital.</P>
<P>About the middle of March the commons or∣dered the proper officers to lay before them an ac∣count of the sums which had been subscribed, and these were taken into consideration by a com∣mittee of the whole house. It was then that Mr. Pelham, as chancellor of the Exchequer, observed, That besides the debts due to the three great com∣panies
<PB N="64" REF="650"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> in their corporate capacity, all the rest carry∣ing four per centum interest, had been subscribed, except about eight or nine millions, the proprietors of which had forfeitd the favour designed them by parliament: but as many of these had been milled by evil counsellors, who perhaps were more intent on distressing the government, than sollici∣tous to serve their friends; and as many were fo∣reigners residing beyond sea, who had not time to take proper advice, and give the necessary instruc∣tions; and as these could not be possibly distin∣guished from such as refused to subscribe from meer obstinacy or dissaffection, it might be thought cruel to take the most rigorous advantage of the forfeiture they had incurred. With respect to the proprietors of the stock or capital belonging to the three great companies, he asserted, that many of them would willingly have subscribed their pro∣perties within the time limited; but were necessa∣rily excluded by the majority on the ballot: and as it was equally impossible to know those who were against the question on the ballot, he thought that some tenderness was due even to the proprietors of those three companies: his opinion therefore was, that they and the complying annuitants should be indulged with further time to compleat their subscription; but, in order to preserve the autho∣rity of parliament, and the respect due to that au∣gust assembly, they ought not to be gratified with such advantageous terms as were allowed to the annuitants, who at first chearfully complied with the proposals offered by the legislature. For these reasons he proposed, That although the term of subscribing should be protracted till the thirtieth
<PB N="65" REF="660"/>
day of May, the encouragement of three pounds<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 17506</NOTE> ten shillings per centum per annum should not be continued to the second subscribers longer than till the fifth day of December, in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and fifty-five. The proposal being approved, a bill was framed for this pur∣pose, as well as for redeeming such annuities as should not be subscribed. It passed through both houses, and was enacted into a law, after having received an additional clause, impowering the East India company, in case they should subscribe all their stock bearing an interest of four per cen∣tum, to borrow, with the consent of the board of treasury, any sums not exceeding four millions two hundred thousand pounds, after the several rates of interest before proposed to be paid by the pub∣lic, and one million more at three per centum per annum. They were also vested with a power to raise money by bonds, as formerly; yet so as the whole, including the annuities, should not exceed what they were by former acts impowered to bor∣row.</P>
<P>The objections to the execution of this project, which by many were deemed insurmountable, in∣tirely vanished before the fortitude, perseverance▪ and caution of the minister; who had secured▪ among the moneyed men of the nation, the pro∣mise of such sums as would have been sufficient to pay off the capital belonging to those creditors who might refuse to accept the interest thus re∣duced.</P>
<P>The second subscription had the desired effect. The three great companies acquiesced, and their example was followed by the other scrupulous an∣nuitants:
<PB N="66" REF="670"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the national burthen was comfortably lightened, and the sinking fund considerably in∣creased, without producing the least perplexity or disturbance in the commonwealth; a circumstance that could not fail to excite the admiration and en∣vy of all Christendom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New mu∣tiny-bill.</NOTE> The mutiny-bill for the ensuing year was miti∣gated with an essential alteration, relating to the oath of secrecy imposed upon the members of every court-martial, who were now released from this reserve, if required to give evidence, by due course of law, in any court of judicature; and whereas, by the former mutiny-bill, a general was impowered to order the revisal of any sentence by a court-martial as often as he pleased, and, on that pretence, to keep in confinement a man who had been acquitted upon a fair trial; it was now en∣acted, That no sentence pronounced by any court-martial, and signed by the president, should be more than once liable to revisal. Colonel George Townshend, son of the lord viscount Townshend, who had equally distinguished himself by his civil and military accomplishments, proposed another clause for preventing any non-commissioned offi∣cer's being broke, or reduced into the ranks; or any soldier's being punished, but by the sentence of a court martial. He gave the house to under∣stand, that certain persons attended at the door, who, from the station of non-commissioned officers, had been broke, and reduced into the ranks, with∣out trial or any cause assigned; and he expatiated not only upon the iniquity of such proceedings, but also upon the danger of leaving such arbitrary power in the hands of any individual officer. A
<PB N="67" REF="680"/>
warm debate was the consequence of this motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> which however was over-ruled by the majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill for encou∣raging the import of iron from America.</NOTE> Among other regulations made in the course of this session, for the encouragement of the British manufactures, a large duty was laid upon Irish sail-cloth, which, being sold at an under-price, was found to interf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re with the same species of commo∣dity fabricated in the island of Great Britain; and, for the further benefit of this last, the bounty upon the exportation of it, which had been deducted from a defective fund, was now made payable out of the customs. This measure, however, was not of such importance to the nation as the act which they passed for encouraging the importation of pig and bar iron from the British colonies in North America.</P>
<P>Every well▪wisher to his country reflected with concern on the nature of the British trade with Sweden, from which kingdom the subjects of his Britannic majesty imported more iron and steel than it supplied for all the other countries in Eu∣rope. For this article they payed a very great bal∣lance in ready money, which the Swedes again ex∣pended in purchasing from the French, and other mercantile powers, those necessaries and superflui∣ties with which they might have been as cheaply furnished by Great Britain. In the mean time, the English colonies in America were restricted by severe duties from making advantage of their own produce, in exchanging their iron for such com∣modities as they were under the necessity of pro∣curing from their mother-country. Such restric∣tion was not only a cruel grievance upon our own settlements, but also attended with manifest preju∣dice
<PB N="68" REF="690"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> to the interest of Great Britain, annually drained of great sums, in favour of an ungrateful nation from which no part of them returned; whereas the iron imported from America must of necessity come in exchange for our own manufac∣tures.</P>
<P>The commons having appointed a day for taking this affair into consideration, carefully examined into the state of the British commerce carried on with Sweden, as well as into the accounts of iron imported from the plantations in America; and the committee of the whole house having resolved, That the duties on American pig and bar iron should be removed, a bill was brought in for that purpose, containing a clause, however, to prevent his majesty's subjects from making steel, and esta∣blishing mills for slitting and rolling iron within the British colonies of America; this precaution being taken, that the colonists might not interfere with the manufactures of their mother-country.</P>
<P>The most remarkable circumstance attending the progress of this bill, which made its way thro' both houses, and obtained the royal assent, was the number of contradictory petitions in favour and in prejudice of it, while it remained under considera∣tion. The tanners of leather, in and about the town of Sheffield in Yorkshire, represented, That if the bill should pass, the English iron would be undersold; consequently a great number of fur∣naces and forges would be discontinued: in that case the woods, used for fuel, would stand uncut, and the tanners be deprived of oak-bark sufficient for the continuance and support of their occupa∣tion. They nevertheless owned, that should the
<PB N="69" REF="700"/>
duty be removed from pig iron only, no such con∣sequence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> could be apprehended; because, should the number of furnaces be lessened, that of forges would be increased. This was likewise the plea urged in divers remonstrances by masters of iron-works, gentlemen, and freeholders, who had tracts of woodland in their possession. The owners, pro∣prietors, and farmers of furnaces and iron-forges, belonging to Sheffield and its neighbourhood, en∣larged upon the great expence they had incurred in erecting and supporting iron-works, by means of which great numbers of his majesty's subjects were comfortably supported. They expressed their apprehension, that should the bill pass into a law, it could not in any degree lessen the consumption of Swedish iron, which was used for purposes which neither the American nor British iron would answer: but that the proposed encouragement, considering the plenty and cheapness of wood in America, would enable the colonies to under<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell the British iron; a branch of traffic which would be totally destroyed, to the ruin of many thousand labourers, who would be compelled to seek their livelihood in foreign countries. They likewise suggested, that if all the iron manufacturers of Great Britain should be obliged to depend upon a supply of iron from the plantations, which must ever be rendered precarious by the hazard of the seas and the enemy, the manufactures would pro∣bably decay for want of materials, and many thou∣sand families be reduced to want and misery. On the other hand, the ironmongers and smiths be∣longing to the flourishing town of Birmingham in Warwickshire, presented a petition, declaring, that
<PB N="70" REF="710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the bill would be of great benefit to the trade of the nation, as it would enable the colonists to make larger returns of their own produce, and encourage them to take a greater quantity of the British manufactures. They affirmed, that all the iron-works in the island of Great Britain did not supply half the quantity of that metal sufficient to carry on the manufacture; that if this deficiency could be supplied from the colonies in America, the importation would cease, and considerable sums of money be saved to the nation. They observed, that the importation of iron from America could no more affect the iron▪works and freeholders of the kingdom, than the like quantity imported from any other country: but they prayed, that the people of America might be restrained from erect∣ing slitting or rolling mills, or forges for plating iron, as they would interfere with the manufac∣tures of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Many remonstrances to the same effect were presented from different parts of the kingdom; and it appeared, upon the most exact inquiry, that the encouragement of American iron would prove extremely beneficial to the kingdom, as it had been found, upon trial, applicable to all the uses of Swedish iron, and as good in every respect as the produce of that country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the British herring fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ery.</NOTE> The next commercial improvement, of which we shall take notice, was the bill for the encou∣ragement of the British white-herring and cod fisheries. This was likewise the result of mature deliberation, importing, That a bounty of thirty s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illings per ton should be granted, and payed out of the customs, to all new vessels from twenty to
<PB N="71" REF="720"/>
fourscore tons burthen, which should be built for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> that purpose, and actually employed in the fishery: That a society should be incorporated, under the name of the free British fishery, by a charter, not exclusive, with power to raise a capital not exceed∣ing five hundred thousand pounds; and that three pounds ten shillings per centum per annum should be granted and payed out of the customs to the proprietors for fourteen years, for so much of the capital as should be actually employed in the said fisheries. Corresponding chambers were proposed to be erected in remote parts of North Britain, for taking in subscriptions, and prosecuting the trade, under the directions of the company at London; and the nation in general seemed eager to dispute this branch of commerce with the subjects of Hol∣land, whom they considered as ungrateful inter∣lopers. In the house of peers, however, the bill met with a formidable opposition from the earl of Winchelsea and lord Sandys, who justly observed, That it was a crude indigested scheme, which, in the execution, would never answer the expectations of the people: That in contending with the Dutch, who are the patterns of unwearied industry, and the most rigid oeconomy, nothing could be more absurd than a joint stock company, which is al∣ways clogged with extraordinary expence; and the resolution of fitting out vessels at the port of Lon∣don, where all sorts of materials, labour, and sea-men, are so much dearer than in any other part of the united kingdom, exclusive of the great distance and dangerous voyage between the me∣tropolis and the Sound of Brassa in Shetland, the rendezvous at which all the herring-busses were
<PB N="72" REF="730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> to assemble in the beginning of the fishing season. They likewise took notice of the heavy duty on salt, used in curing the fish for sale, and the beef for provision to the mariners; a circumstance of itself sufficient to discourage adventurers from em∣barking in a commerce which, at best, yields but very slender profits to the trader in particular, how important soever it might prove to the community in general. These objections were answered by the duke of Argyle and the earl of Granville, who seemed to think that this branch of trade could not be fairly set on foot, without such a considerable sum of money as no single individual would care to advance; that a joint-stock company would be able to prosecute the fishery at a smaller expence than that which particular traders must necessarily incur: that the present spirit of the nation, which was eagerly bent upon trying the experiment, ought not to be baulked by delay, lest it should evaporate; and that though the plan was not un∣exceptionable, the defects of it might in the sequel be remedied by the legislature. In a word, the bill was adopted by the majority, with a small amendment in the title, which produced some dis∣quiets in the lower house: but this dispute was compromised, and it was enacted into a law towards the close of the session.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more agreeable to the public than the sanction of the legislature to this favou∣rite plan, which was ardently promoted and pa∣tronized by men of the greatest eminence for wealth and popularity. The company chose for their governor his royal highness the prince of Wales, who received this proof of their attach∣ment
<PB N="73" REF="740"/>
and respect with particular marks of satisfac∣tion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the president and vice-president were both aldermen of London; and the council was com∣posed of thirty gentlemen, the majority of whom were members of parliamenr. Great pains were taken, and some artifice was used, to learn the Dutch method of curing the fish. People crowded with their subscriptions; a number of hands were employed in building and equipping the busses or vessels used in the fishery; and the most favour∣able consequences were expected from the general vigour and alacrity which animated these prepa∣rations. But the success did not gratify the san∣guine hope of the projectors and adventurers. The objections made in the house of lords soon appeared to have been well founded: these co∣operating with mismanagement in the directors, the spirit of the company began to flag; the na∣tural consequence of commercial disappointment; and now the British fishery seems to languish un∣der the neglect of the legislature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Afri∣can com∣pany.</NOTE> Touching the trade to the coast of Africa, peti∣tions were renewed by the company and its cre∣ditors, the merchants of Bristol, Liverpool, and Lancaster; and a remonstrance was presented by the planters and merchants interested in the British sugar-settlements in America: but the commons adhered to their former resolutions of laying open the trade, maintaining the forts at the public ex∣pence, and regulating the commerce by a com∣mittee of merchants, representing the chief trading towns in the kingdom, to be superintended by the board of trade and plantations. The bill was ac∣cordingly framed and presented, and, having pro∣ceeded
<PB N="74" REF="750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> through both houses without opposition, obtained the royal assent.</P>
<P>Over and above these wise, salutary, and patrio∣tical measures for the improvement of commerce, they encouraged the importation of raw silk by an act reducing the duties formerly payable on that which was the growth of China, to the same that is raised on the raw silk from Italy, and allowing the same drawback upon the exportation of the one which had been usually granted on the other. A second bill was brought in for the encouragement of the growth and culture of silk in Carolina and Georgia, where it had been lately produced with extraordinary success, by freeing from all duties that which should be imported from his majesty's dominions in America: and a third was framed, permitting raw silk of the growth or produce of Persia, purchased in Russia, to be imported into Great Britain, from any port or place belonging to the empire of Russia.</P>
<P>Divers efforts were made, by different members in the opposition, to rectify certain abuses in the army and administration: some bills they brought in, and several petitions were left on the table; but all of them proved abortive, from the power and influence of the minister, who seemed resolved that no benefit should flow upon the nation thro' any channel but his own. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged, for the honour of his memory, that there is no session on record so productive as this was of measures advantageous to the community.</P>
<P>The people, however, were not intirely satisfied with the conduct of the administration, if we may
<PB N="75" REF="760"/>
judge from the ferment and commotions raised<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> during the progress of an election for a citizen to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Westmin∣ster elec∣tion.</NOTE> represent in parliament the city of Westminster. The seat which had been filled by lord Trentham, eldest son of earl Gower, having become vacant, in consequence of that nobleman's accepting a place at the board of admiralty, he again declared him∣self a candidate, and met with a violent opposition. Those who stiled themselves the independent elec∣tors of Westminster, being now incensed to an un∣common degree of turbulence by the interposition of ministerial influence, determined to use their utmost endeavours for baffling the designs of the court, and at the same time take vengeance on the family of earl G—r, who had entirely abandoned the opposition, of which he was formerly one of the most respected leaders. With this view they held consultations, agreed to resolutions, and set up a private gentleman, named Sir George Vande∣put, as the competitor of lord Trentham, declaring that they would support his pretensions at their own expence, being the more encouraged to this enterprize by the countenance and assistance of the prince of Wales and his adherents. They accord∣ingly opened houses of entertainment for their par∣tisans, sollicited votes, circulated remonstrances, and propagated abuse: in a word, they canvassed, with surprising spirit and perseverance, against the whole interest of St. James's. Mobs were hired and processions made on both sides, and the city of Westminster was filled with tumult and uproar. The mutual animosity of the parties seemed every day to increase during the election, and a great number of unqualified votes were on both sides
<PB N="76" REF="770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> presented: all the powers of in sinuation, obloquy, and ridicule were employed to vilify and depreciate both candidates. At length the poll being closed, a majority of votes appeared in behalf of lord Trentham: but a scrutiny being demanded by the other side, the returning officer complied with their request.</P>
<P>The speaker of the lower house had issued his warrant for a new writ of election about the mid∣dle of November; and towards the end of Fe∣bruary Mr. Fox, secretary at war, standing up, and observing that no return had yet been made, thought proper to move, That the clerk of the crown, the messenger extraordinary attending the great seal, the under-sheriff of Middlesex, and the high-bailiff of Westminster, should attend next morning, and give an account of their issuing, delivering, and executing the writ of election. These being examined, and the high-bailiff de∣claring that he would proceed with all possible dis∣patch in the scrutiny which had been demanded and was begun, Mr. Speaker explained to him some particulars of his duty; in the discharge of which, he was given to understand, he might de∣pend upon the protection of the house, should he meet with any obstruction which he could not other∣wise surmount.</P>
<P>By the violence and caprice with which a great number of votes were on both sides contested, the scrutiny was a long time protracted, and the return attended with some extraordinary consequences, which shall be particularised among the transactions of the next year.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="780"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> In the mean time, the present session of parlia∣ment was closed on the twelfth day of April, with a speech from the throne, commending the com∣mons for having seized the very first opportunity of reducing the interest of the national debt, with∣out the least infringement upon the faith of parlia∣ment; and congratulating them on the flourishing state of the public credit, which could not fail to add strength and reputation to the government both at home and abroad. Immediately after the rising of the parliament, his majesty appointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence, and embarked for the continent, in order to visit his German dominions.</P>
<P>The month of January and the beginning of February were distinguished, the first by a very remarkable Aurora Borealis, appearing at night to the north east, of a deep and dusky red colour, like the reflection of some great fire, for which it was by many people mistaken; and the corruscations, unlike those that are generally observed, did not meet in the zenith, but in a point some degrees to the southward. February was ushered in by terri∣ble peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, and such a tempest of wind, hail, and rain, as overwhelmed with fear and consternation the inhabitants of Bristol, where it chiefly raged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A succes∣sion of two vio∣lentearth∣quakes in London.</NOTE> On the eighth day of the same month, between the hours of twelve and one in the afternoon, the people of London were still more dreadfully alarm∣ed by the shock of an earthquake, which shook all the houses with such violence, that the furni∣ture rocked on the floors, the pewter and porce∣lain rattled on the shelves, the chamber-bells rung,
<PB N="78" REF="790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> and the whole of this commotion was attended with a clap or noise resembling that produced by the fall of a heavy bureau. The shock extended through the cities of London and Westminster, and was felt on both sides of the river Thames, from Green∣wich to the Westward of London; but not percep∣tible at any considerable distance.</P>
<P>On the very same day of the next month, be∣tween five and six o'clock in the morning, the in∣habitants of the metropolis were again affrighted by a second shock more violent than the first, and abundantly more alarming, as it waked the greater part of the people from their repose. It was pre∣ceded by a succession of thick low flashes of light∣ning, and a rumbling noise, like that of a heavy carriage rolling over a hollow pavement. The shock itself consisted of repeated vibrations, which lasted some seconds, and violently shook every house from top to bottom. Again the chairs rocked, the shelves clattered, the small bells rung, and in some places public clocks were heard to strike. Many persons roused by this terrible visita∣tion, started naked from their beds, and ran to their doors and windows in distraction: yet no life was lost, and no house overthrown by this concus∣sion, though it was so dreadful as to threaten an immediate dissolution of the globe. The circum∣stance, however, did not fail to make a deep im∣pression upon ignorant, weak, and superstitious minds, which were the more affected by the consi∣deration that the two shocks were periodical; that the second, which happened exactly one month af∣ter the first, had been the more violent; and that the next, increasing in proportion, might be at∣tended
<PB N="79" REF="800"/>
with the most dreadful consequences. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> general notion was confirmed, and indeed propa∣gated among all ranks of people, by the admoni∣tions of a fanatic soldier, who publickly preached up repentance, and boldly prophesied that the next shock would happen on the same day of April, and totally destroy the cities of London and Westmin∣ster. Considering the infectious nature of fear and superstition, and the emphatic manner in which the imagination had been prepared and prepos∣sessed, it is no wonder that the effusions of this illi∣terate enthusiast should have contributed in a great measure to augment the general terror. The churches were crowded with penitent sinners: the sons of riot and profligacy were overawed into so∣briety and decorum. The streets no longer re∣sounded with execrations, or the noise of brutal li∣centiousness; and the hand of charity was liberally opened. Those whom fortune had enabled to re∣tire from the devoted city, fled to the country with hurry and precipitation, insomuch that the high∣ways were encumbered with horses and carriages. Many who had, in the beginning, combated these groundless fears with the weapons of reason and ri∣dicule, began insensibly to imbibe the contagion, and felt their hearts fail, in proportion as the hour of probation approached: even science and philo∣sophy were not proof against the unaccountable effects of this communication. In after-ages it will hardly be believed, that on the evening of the eighth day of April, the open fields, that skirt the metropolis, were filled with an incredible num∣ber of people, assembled in chairs, in chaises, and coaches, as well on foot, who waited in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posture of affairs on the con∣tinent.</NOTE> The affairs of the continent underwent no re∣markable alteration. An ambassador extraordinary being sent to Petersburg from the court of Lon∣don, declared to the Czarina's minister, that in case<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes between Russia and Sweden,</NOTE> of a rupture between Russia and Sweden, occa∣sioned by the hostilities committed by the former power, his Britannic majesty would consider Russia as the aggressor; and the Czarina could not expect that he would supply her with the succours which he was engaged by treaty to furnish for her de∣fence, in case she should be attacked. A declara∣tion of the same nature was made by the ambassa∣dor of her imperial majesty the queen of Hungary; while the ministers of France and Prussia, who were in strict alliance with Sweden, gave her to under∣stand, that they would punctually fulfil their en∣gagements with the court of Stockholm, should she actually invade the Swedish territories of Fin∣land. The spirit with which the king of Prussia exerted himself on this occasion, gave infinite um∣brage to the Czarina, who, indeed, expressed her resentment by treating the minister of Branden∣burg with contemptuous neglect, and even refused to favour him with an audience, until he should be vested with the character of ambassador. Thus were sown the seeds of misunderstanding between those two powers, which, in the sequel, grew up to the most bitter animosity, and served to inflame those dissensions which have desolated the fairest provinces of Germany.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan for electing the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch∣duke Jo∣seph king of the Romans.</NOTE> The attention of his Britannic majesty was not wholly engrossed by the disputes between Russia and Sweden. He had another object in view, which more nearly concerned the interest of his German dominions; and had set on foot two ne∣gotiations of the utmost importance to the com∣merce and advantage of Great Britain. His first and principal aim was, in conjunction with the court of Vienna, to take such measures as would secure the succession of the imperial dignity to the archduke Joseph, eldest son and heir of the reign∣ing emperor. As the previous step to that eleva∣tion, it was proposed to elect this young prince king of the Romans; and for this purpose it was necessary to procure a majority not only of the electors, but also in the diet of the empire, through which the proposal must have passed. No stone was left unturned to reconcile this expedient to the German princes. Subsidies were offered by the maritime powers of England and the States Ge∣neral to the electors of Mentz and Cologne; and a treaty of the same nature was concluded with the elector of Bavaria, who, in consideration of an an∣nual subsidy, amounting to forty thousand pounds sterling, two thirds of which to be payed by Bri∣tain, and the rest by the States General, engaged to keep in readiness a body of six thousand in∣fantry, as auxiliaries to the Maritime Powers, tho' not to act against the emperor or empire; and to
<PB N="83" REF="840"/>
join the interest of his Britannic majesty in the diet<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> as well as in the electoral college.</P>
<P>In order to render the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, propitious to this design, he was ac∣commodated with the loan of a very considerable sum, upon the mortgage of certain bailiwicks and lordships belonging to the Saxon dominions.</P>
<P>Thus a majority of the electors were secured, and such foundations laid for the success of this project, that it was generally believed it would be accomplished in his Britannic majesty's next visit to his German dominions. Hopes (it was said) were given to the king of Sweden, that his concurrence would be gratified by erecting the house of Hesse Cassel, of which he was head, into a tenth electo∣rate. Arguments of an interesting nature were used with the king of Prussia and the elector Pala∣tine, that, if possible, the diet might unanimously approve of this measure, so necessary for establish∣ing the peace of the empire, and preventing such troubles as arose from a disputed succession at the death of the sixth Charles.

This monarch had set himself up as a ballance to the power of the house of Austria, which had long aspired to absolute dominion over its co estates, and endeavoured to establish an hereditary right of succession to the empire: he therefore employed all his influence to frustrate the measure proposed, either actuated by a spirit of pure patriotism, or
<PB N="84" REF="850"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> inspired with designs which he has not yet thought proper to declare. The opposition was joined by the elector Palatine, and countenanced by the French king; who protested, that, for the sake of peace, he would not oppose this election, though contrary to the Golden Bull, provided it should be confirmed by the unanimous consent of the electo∣ral college: but should any one member signify his dissent, and he or any state of the empire claim the protection and assistance of his most Christian ma∣jesty, he could not dispense with granting both, in consequence of his being guarantee of the treaty of Westphalia: an engagement by which he was obliged to succour those princes and states of the empire who might have recourse to him, in case of any grievance they suffered, contrary to what was stipulated in that constitution. This declaration co-operating with the known character of his Prus∣sian majesty, whose great army overawed Hanover and Bohemia, in all probability damped that vi∣gour with which the courts of Vienna and Heren∣hausen had hitherto prosecuted this important ne∣gotiation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utes with the French about the limits of Nova Scotia.</NOTE> The second object that employed the attention of the British ministry, was the establishment of the precise limits of Acadia, or Nova Scotia, where the new colony had suffered great mischief and in∣terruption from the incursions of the Indians, ex∣cited to these outrages by the subjects and emissa∣ries of France. Commissaries were appointed by both crowns to meet at Paris, and compromise these disputes: but the conferences were rendered abortive by every art of cavilling, chicanery, and procrastination, which the French commissioners
<PB N="85" REF="860"/>
opposed to the justice and perspicuity of the Eng∣lish<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> claims. They not only misinterpreted treaties, though expressed with the utmost precision, and perplexed the conferences with difficulties and mat∣ter foreign to the subject, but they carried the finesse of perfidy so far as to produce false charts and maps of the country, in which the rivers and boundaries were misplaced and misrepresented. At this time also the insincerity of the French court appeared in affected delays and artful objections, with respect to the evacuation of the neutral islands in the West Indies; and the governors of the Bri∣tish plantations, in different parts of North Ame∣rica, transmitted intelligence, importing, that the French had begun to make encroachments on the back of the English colonies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Spain.</NOTE> Perhaps the precarious footing on which the peace stood between Great Britain and France at this juncture, and the critical situation of affairs in Germany, determined the ministry of England to compromise all differences with Spain, upon such terms as at any other time they would hardly have embraced. In order to discuss those points between the two nations, which had not been settled by the treaty of Aix-la▪Chapelle, conferences were also begun at Madrid, and carried on by Mr. Keene, plenipotentiary of his Britannic majesty, and Don Joseph de Carvajal and Lancastro, the Spanish king's minister. At length a treaty was concluded on these conditions: The king of Spain engaged to pay, in three months, to the South-sea company of England one hundred thousand pounds sterling, as an indemnification for all claims upon his crown, by virtue of the Assiento. In other respects, the
<PB N="86" REF="870"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> trade and navigation of the English to the ports of Spain were regulated by former treaties. It was stipulated, That they should pay no other duties than those that were exacted of them in the reign of Charles II. of Spain: That they should be treated on the footing of the most favoured na∣tions, and continue to enjoy the privilege of taking salt at the island of Tortuga. But there was no article restricting the Spanish guarda-costas from searching the Brit sh vessels on the high seas; al∣though, as we have already observed, this insolent prerogative, assumed without right, and exercised without humanity▪ was, in effect, the original and sole cause of the last rupture, which had been at∣tended with such enormous expence to the nation. It must be owned, however, that his Catholic ma∣jesty was at this period extremely well disposed to live upon good terms with Great Britain. He was resolved to indulge his people with the blessings of peace, to propagate a spirit of industry throughout his dominions, and in particular to encourage com∣merce, which he foresaw would prove a much more certain and inexhaustible source of wealth, power, and influence, than all the treasures he could drain from the mines of Mexico and Peru. His resolu∣tions on this interesting subject were chiefly di∣rected by Don Ricardo Wall, who now acted as his minister at London; a gentleman who had dis∣tinguished himself in the field as well as in the cabinet, and p ssessed the joint qualifications of a general and a statesman. He had, by virtue of a passport, come over privately to England before the peace, in order to pave the way for the treaty, by a secret negotiation with the English ministers;
<PB N="87" REF="880"/>
but immediately after the peace was proclaimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> he appeared in the character of ambassador. He was possessed of the most insinuating address, shrewd, penetrating, and inquisitive. While he resided in London, he spared no pains in learning the nature of those manufactures, and that com∣merce, by which Great Britain had been so re∣markably aggrandized; and on his return to Spain, where in a little time he was placed at the helm of affairs, he turned the knowledge he had thus ac∣quired to the advantage of his country. He not only promoted the useful arts within the kingdom of Spain, but demonstrated the infinite advantage that would accrue from an active trade, which the Spaniards had for many ages neglected; and in a few years their ships were seen to swarm in all the commercial ports of Europe.</P>
<P>Of other foreign events, which distinguished this summer,' the most remarkable was the death of John king of Portugal, who perfectly understood and steadily pursued the true interest of his coun∣try, and in whom many princely qualities were debased by a cruel spirit of bigotry and supersti∣tion. He was succeeded by his eldest son Joseph, who, if he has fallen short of his father in some re∣spects, cannot be justly charged with having inhe∣rited this paternal weakness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The king of Great Britain, having returned to England, opened the session of parliament in Ja∣nuary with a speech, importing, That he had con∣cluded a treaty with the king of Spain, and ami∣cably adjusted such differences as could not be so properly compromised in a general treaty: That the commerce of this nation with that country
<PB N="88" REF="890"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> was re-established upon the most advantageous and sure foundations; and that there was the greatest reason to hope the antient friendship between Great Britain and Spain would, from mutual inclination as well as interest, be now effectually restored. He told them, That, in conjunction with the Empress-queen and the States General, he had concluded a treaty with the elector of Bavaria; and was em∣ployed in taking such further measures as might best tend to strengthen and secure the tranquillity of the empire, support its system, and timely anti∣cipate such events as had been found by experience to endanger the common cause, involve Europe in the calamities of war, and occasion the loss of much blood and treasure to these kingdoms. He pro∣mised, That both these treaties should be subjected to their perusal: he gave them to understand, That he had received from all the other contracting powers in the definitive treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the most full and clear declarations of their resolu∣tion to preserve the general peace; and that he had taken care to consolidate the ties of union and friendship between him and his allies, the better to secure their mutual interests, maintain the peace already subsisting, and prevent the occasion of any future rupture. Finally, he recommended unani∣mity, the improvement of commerce, and the ef∣fectual suppression of such outrages and violences as are inconsistent with good order and govern∣ment, and endanger the lives and properties of the subject, whose happiness and flourishing condition he had intirely at heart.</P>

implicit complaisance, approbation, and acquies∣cence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> in the measures which the crown had taken, the earl of Eg—t, and some other anti-courtiers, affirmed, that such an address would be equally servile and absurd. They observed, That nothing could be more preposterous than a blind approba∣tion of measures which they did not know: That nothing could be more ridiculous than their con∣gratulations on the present happy tranquillity, when almost every day's news-papers informed them of some British ship's being seized by the Spaniards, or some new attack made by the French on our infant colony in Nova Scotia. With respect to the continent of Europe, they affirmed, That the tranquillity of Germany would have been upon a much more solid foundation, had England never interposed in the affairs of the Empire: in that case the princes would of themselves have supported the constitution of their own country: That the election of an infant for king of the Romans, was much more likely to disturb than establish the tranquillity of Europe; because it would help to overturn the constitution of the Empire, by ren∣dering the imperial dignity hereditary in one house, instead of being the result of a free election. They took notice, that the constitution had provided vicars to govern the Empire during the vacancy of the imperial throne; but had made no provi∣sion of regents, protectors, or guardians for a mi∣nor emperor, because it never was supposed that a minor would be chosen. They inveighed against the late treaty with Spain; in which, they said, the ministry, for the paultry sum of one hundred thou∣sand pounds, had given up the claims of the South-sea
<PB N="90" REF="910"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> company, and other British merchants, who had suffered from depredations to the amount of one million three hundred thousand pounds; and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red away the freedom of our trade and navi∣gation, by leaving untouched that prerogative which the Spaniards have assumed of searching the British sh ps in the open seas▪ and confiscating them, should they find on board the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast particle of what they call contraband merchandize. They produced an instance of an English ship, lately driven by stress of weather into one of the ports of the Spanish West Indies, where she was searched, seized, and condemned under this pretence. They recapitulated the conduct of the French, who, in the midst of their declarations of peace and mode∣ration, were st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l employed in fortifying their settle∣ments on the neutral islands, as well as in harrassing and incroaching upon our plantations in North America. They exclaimed against the treaty of subsidy with the elector of Bavaria, or any other prince, in time of peace; observing, that for some years the nation had payed such pensions to the Danes and the Hessians; but, in the course of the late war, the former abandoned our interests, and the latter actually took arms against Great Britain. Finally, they affirmed, that the subsidy was greater than the nation could spare; for, unle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the land-tax should be continued at four shillings in the pound, they could not afford a shilling to any prince in Germany, without encroaching upon the sinking fund. "At such a juncture (said a certain member will any gentleman presume to propose the continuation of such an imposition on the land-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>older, for the sake of b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the princes of Ger∣many

to do what?—to preserve the freedom and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> independency of their native country. I say, princes of Germany, because this subsidy to Bava∣ria will signify nothing, unless we take half a score more of them into our pay; and when we have thus indulged them for seven years of peace, they may give us the slip as others have done, when∣ever another war shall be declared."</P>
<P>Against these objections the motion was sup∣ported by Mr. William Pitt, at this time an advo∣cate for the ministry. He observed, That the ad∣dress was no more than the usual compliment to the throne, which did not imply an obligation on the parliament to approve of measures which they might find cause to censure upon further inquiry. He said, the trivial disputes still subsisting between this nation and the Spaniards, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench, would soon be terminated amicably, and could never af∣fect the general tranquillity of Europe, which was to be established upon a firm alliance between his majesty and such a confederacy upon the continent, as would be an over-match for the house of Bour∣bon. He expatiated upon his majesty's wisdom in taking off from the French interest such a power∣ful prince as the elector of Bavaria, and concert∣ing other salutary measures for preserving the bal∣lance or power on the continent. He desended the articles of the late treaty with Spain; observing, that what remained of the Assiento-contract was a matter of very little consequence to the South-sea company; that the demands of this company, and other British merchants, were all cancelled by the rupture with Spain, and more than recompensed to the nation by a great ballance of captures during
<PB N="92" REF="930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the war, as well as by the great traffick carried on with the Spanish settlements in the West Indies, after it had been laid open by the demolition of their fortresses. He asserted, that by this treaty the court of Spain had made many important con∣cessions: they had condescended to pay a great sum to the South▪sea company: they had con∣sented to the re establishment of the British trade in Spain, upon a very advantageous and solid foot∣ing, by agreeing that the subjects of Great Britain should pay no other duties on merchandize than those exacted of his catholic majesty's own sub∣jects, and to abolish all the innovations that had been introduced into the commerce. He affirmed, that the article of No Search was a stipulation which it would have been ridiculous to insist upon; and thought proper to obviate a reproach which he foresaw the opposition would throw upon him, from the circumstance of his having▪ upon a former occasion, heartily concurred in a motion for an ad∣dress, That no treaty of peace with Spain should be admitted, unless such a stipulation should be first obtained as a preliminary. He owned he had strenuously contended for such a motion, because at that time, being very young and sanguine, he thought it right and reasonable: but he was now ten years older, had considered matters more cooly, and was convinced that the privilege of No Search, with respect to British vessels sailing near the Ame∣rican shore▪ would never be obtained, unless Spain should be brought so low as to acquiesce in any terms we as victors might propose. He likewise signified his conviction, that all addresses from the house of commons, during the course of a war, for
<PB N="93" REF="940"/>
prescribing terms of peace, were in themselves ridi∣culous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> and that every such address was an en∣croachment on the king's prerogative, which had always been attended with unlucky consequences.</P>
<P>How far these arguments are satisfactory, con∣clusive, and consistent, we shall leave to the rea∣der's determination. Certain it is, they were adopted by the majority, and the address was pre∣sented without further opposition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted for the ensuing year.</NOTE> The two grand committees which are appointed to discuss the supplies for the ensuing year, and the funds upon which they are to be raised, proceeded as usual under the direction of the ministry; yet not without some vehement opposition, in which certain servants of the crown expressed the most hearty concurrence. When a motion was made for reducing the number of seamen to eight thou∣sand, Mr. W. Pitt, Mr. Lyttleton, and Mr. G. Green∣ville, opposed it with all their might of argument and elocution; but they were over-ruled. An∣nual debates were also revived, with the same success, upon the number of the troops consti∣tuting the standing army; but the other resolu∣tions of the grand committees met with little or no opposition.</P>
<P>The number of seamen for the ensuing year was limited to eight thousand; and that of the stand∣ing forces continued at eighteen thousand eight hundred and fifty seven effective men, including one thousand eight hundred and fifteen invalids.</P>
<P>The commons granted a considerable sum of money for paying off the principal of such redeem∣able stocks as had not been subscribed, in pur∣suance of two acts passed in the last session for re∣ducing
<PB N="94" REF="950"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> the interest of annuities. Thirty thousand pounds were given for fulfilling the king's engage∣ment with the elector of Bavaria: large grants were made for supplying deficiencies, and replac∣ing sums borrowed from the sinking fund.</P>
<P>The expence incurred by the new colony in No∣va Scotia, not provided for by parliament, exceed∣ed fifty-seven thousand pounds; and the mainte∣nance of it for the ensuing year was fixed at fifty-three thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven pounds fourteen shillings and four-pence. An enormous charge! if we consider to how little pur∣pose all this bounty hath been bestowed.</P>
<P>A fund was established, under the sanction of parliament, for the relief and maintenance of the widows of sea officers, by allowing, upon the books of every ship of war in sea-pay, the wages and vic∣tuals of one man for every hundred of which the complement should consist, for such time only as the number of men employed in the service of the royal navy should not exceed twenty thousand. This was an additional indulgence, over and above the allowance of one man granted by a former act of parliament.</P>
<P>On the whole, the provisions of this year a∣mounted to five millions one hundred twenty▪five thousand twenty▪three pounds eleven shillings and seven-pence, to be ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by the usual duties: the sum of one million twenty-six thousand four hundred seventy▪six pounds four shillings and six∣pence, advanced by the company of the bank of England, to pay off their own unsubscribed annui∣ties, for which they accepted exchequer-bills at three pounds per centum interest; by the land▪tax

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deathand character of the prince of Wales.</NOTE> In the midst of these deliberations the kingdom was alarmed with an event which overwhelmed the people with grief and consternation. His royal highness the prince of Wales, in consequence of a cold caught in his garden at Kew, was seized with a pleuretic disorder; and, after a short illness, ex∣pired on the twentieth day of March, to the un∣speakable affliction of his royal consort, and the unfeigned sorrow of all who wished well to their country. This excellent prince, who now died in the forty-fifth year of his age, was possessed of every amiable quality which could engage the affection of the people: a tender and obliging husband, a fond parent, a kind master, liberal, generous, can∣did, and humane; a munificent patron of the arts, an unwearied friend to merit; well disposed to as∣sert the rights of mankind in general, and warmly attached to the interest of Great Britain. The na∣tion could not but be afflicted at seeing a prince of such expectations ravished from their hopes; and their grief was the better founded, as the king had already attained to an advanced age, and the heir-apparent George, now prince of Wales, was a minor.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751. Settle∣ment of a regency. in case of a miner sovereign.</NOTE> His majesty, foreseeing all the inconveniences which might arise from a minority, deliberated with his council on this subject, and resolved to ob∣tain a parliamentary sanction for the measures judged necessary to secure the succession. With this view he sent a message to both houses on the twenty-sixth day of April, importing, That nothing could conduce so much to the preservation of the protestant succession in his royal family, as proper provisions for the tuition of the person of his suc∣cessor, and for the regular administration of the government, in case the successor should be of ten∣der years: his majesty therefore earnestly recom∣mended this weighty affair to the deliberation of parliament; and proposed, that when the imperial crown of these realms should descend to any of the late prince's sons, being under the age of eighteen years, his mother, the princess dowager of Wales, should be guardian of his person, and regent of these kingdoms, until he should attain the age of majority, with such powers and limitations as should appear necessary and expedient for these purposes. This message produced a very affec∣tionate address, promising to take the affair into their serious consideration; and in the beginning of May the duke of Newcastle presented to the house of peers a bill to provide for the administra∣tion of government, in case the crown should descend to a minor. The bill was read a second time, and committed, when a second message ar∣rived from his majesty, recommending to their consideration the settlement of such a council of regency as the bill proposed, consisting of his royal highness the duke of Cumberland, who at that
<PB N="97" REF="990"/>
time commanded the army, the archbishop of Can∣terbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> the lord chancellor, the lord high trea∣surer, or first lord commissioner of the treasury, the president of the council, the lord privy-seal, the lord high admiral of Great Britain, or first com∣missioner of the admiralty, the two principal secre∣taries of state, and the lord chief justice of the King's Bench, all these great officers (except his royal highness the duke) for the time being.</P>
<P>This bill did not pass through the lower house without violent debate and bitter sarcasms. The council of regency, though espoused by all the ministry, including the paymaster-general, met with fierce opposition, as an unnecessary and fatal re∣striction that would impede the machine of govern∣ment, and, as the council was constituted, might be productive of the most pernicious consequences. Some of the members ventured even to insinuate the danger of leaving at the head of a large stand∣ing army a prince of the blood, vested with a share of the regency, possessed of great personal in∣fluence, the darling of the soldiery, brave, popular, and enterprising; supposed not wholly devoid of ambition, and not at all remarkable for any symp∣toms of extraordinary affection towards the person of the heir-apparent. The history of England was ransacked for invidious instances of royal uncles and regents, who had injured the sovereigns, and distressed the government, by their pride, cruelty, and ambition. The characters of John Lackland, and John of Ghent, Humphrey and Richard dukes of Gloucester, were called in review, canvassed, compared, and quoted with some odious applica∣tions: but the majority, being convinced of the
<PB N="98" REF="1000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> loyalty, virtue, integrity, and great abilities of his royal highness, to whom the nation owed obliga∣tions of the most important nature, passed the bill with a few amendments, in which the lords ac∣quiesced; and in a little time it received the royal sanction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General naturali∣zation-bill.</NOTE> The death of his royal highness the prince of Wales was fatal to a bill which had been brought into the house of commons, for naturalizing all fo∣reign protestants who should settle within the domi∣nions of Great Britain. Political arithmeticians have generally taken it for granted, that, to every commercial nation, an increase of people is an in∣crease of opulence; and this maxim is certainly true, on the supposition that every individual is in∣dustrious, and that there is a sufficient field for em∣ployment; but all these general maxims ought to be adopted under certain qualifications. When all branches of manufacture are overstocked, an ad∣dition of workmen will doubtless be an additional incumbrance on the community. In the debates, which this bill produced, the members of the mi∣nistry were divided among themselves. The mea∣sure was espoused by the chancellor of the Exche∣quer, Mr. W. Pitt, and Mr. Lyttleton; and in op∣posing it the earl of Egmont was joined by Mr. Fox, secretary at war.</P>
<P>Petitions and counter-petitions were presented by the merchants of London, Bristol, and other trading towns of the kingdom. All merchants and traders of foreign extraction exerted them∣selves vigorously in its behalf, and it was without doubt countenanced by the administration; but the project was odious to the people in general.
<PB N="99" REF="1010"/>
The lord-mayor, aldermen, and commons of Lon∣don,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> in common council assembled, composed a remonstrance to the lower house, setting forth the danger and inutility of a general naturalization of foreign protestants. A petition of the merchants and principal inhabitants of Bristol, represented, that such a law would be prejudicial to the trade and commerce of this kingdom, by preventing many industrious artificers from procuring a suffi∣cient support for themselves and their families, and of consequence increasing the rates of the poor: that the introduction of such a number of fo∣reigners, instead of being a support to the present happy establishment, might endanger the very basis of our constitution: that it would greatly tend to the diminution of our manufactures, as many strangers would doubtless come and reside in Eng∣land for a time, in order to learn the methods and management of our manufacturers and artificers; and, after having obtained this instruction, return to their native countries, where they would establish and carry on works of the same nature.</P>
<P>The twentieth day of March being appointed for the third reading of the bill, it was postponed, in consequence of the unfortunate death of the prince of Wales; and other petitions from different cities of the kingdom being mustered against it in the sequel, the ministry did not think proper to persist in an unpopular measure at such a delicate conjuncture; so the bill was no more brought upon the carpet.</P>
<P>Divers other regulations, relating to civil policy as well as to the commerce of Great Britain, were propounded in the house of commons; but these
<PB N="100" REF="1020"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> proposals proved abortive, either because they ap∣peared crude and indigested in themselves, or the house could not obtain proper information touch∣ing the allegations they contained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Censure past upon a paper intituled Constitu∣tional Queries.</NOTE> Other transactions in this session there were none, except the concurrence of both houses in stigma∣tizing a printed paper, intituled, "Constitutional Queries, earnestly recommended to the serious con∣sideration of every true Briton;" and the steps taken by the commons, in consequence of the com∣motions occasioned by the Westminster election. The abovementioned paper, which had been con∣veyed by letter to the majority of both houses, was in the month of January communicated to the lords by the duke of Marlborough, who moved for re∣solutions against it as a seditious libel, and that the concurrence of the commons might be desired. A conference accordingly ensued, and both houses concurred in voting the paper a false, malicious, scandalous, infamous, and seditious libel, contain∣ing the most false, audacious, and abominable ca∣lumnies and indignities upon his majesty, and the most presumptuous and wicked insinuations that our laws, liberties, and properties, and the excel∣lent constitution of this kingdom, were in danger under his majesty's legal, mild, and gracious go∣vernment, with intent to instil groundless suspi∣cions and jealousies into the minds of his majesty's good subjects, and to alienate their affections from his ma esty and his royal family. It was therefore resolved, by the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons in parliament assembled, That, in ab∣horrence and detestation of such abominable and seditious practices, the paper should be burnt by
<PB N="101" REF="1030"/>
the hands of the common hangman in the new<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> Palace-yard of Westminster; and this sentence was executed accordingly. Then they presented an address to his majesty, desiring that the most ef∣fectual means might be taken for discovering the author, printer, or publisher, that he or they might be brought to condign punishment. Directions were given for this purpose; but without effect. Those concerned in writing, printing, and circu∣lating the paper, had acted with such caution, that not one of them was ever discovered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings on the elec∣tion of a citizen for Westmin∣ster.</NOTE> The proceedings of the commons, with respect to the election of a burgess for Westminster, were attended with some extraordinary circumstances, which we shall now record, for the edification of those who pique themselves on the privileges of a British subject. We have already observed, that a majority appearing on the poll for lord Trent∣ham, the adherents of the other candidate, Sir George Vandeput, demanded a scrutiny, which was granted by the high bailiff of Westminster, the returning officer. During this tedious investi∣gation, which rolled chiefly on the qualification of voters, he acted with such address and seeming candour as gave intire satisfaction to both parties, until at length he determined in favour of his lord∣ship, whom he returned as duly elected. Those who stiled themselves the independent electors, did not acquiesce in this determination without cla∣mour, reproach, menaces, and riot. They taxed Mr. Leigh the high bailiff with partiality and in∣justice: they loudly affirmed, that ministerial in∣fluence had been used in the most scandalous man∣ner; and, finally, joined Sir George Vandeput in a
<PB N="102" REF="1040"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> petition to the lower house, complaining of an undue election and return of a member for the city of Westminster. The commons, instead of inquiring into the merits of these petitions, ordered them to lie upon the table; and, without any com∣plaint from any person whatever, a motion was made, that Leigh the high bailiff should attend the house immediately, in order to make them ac∣quainted with what he had done in pursuance to the directions he had formerly received from that house, touching the execution of the writ for elect∣ing a new member to represent the city of West∣minster. As this motion had been preconcerted, Leigh was attending in the lobby, and imme∣diately called into the house to be examined on this subject. Having, in the course of his examina∣tion, alledged, that the election had been pro∣tracted by affected delays, he was asked by whom, and by what means; but, before he could answer, the earl of Egmont, interposing, objected to the question as improper, and moved for the order of the day. A debate immediately ensued, in which the impropriety of the question was demonstrated by Mr. Henley, now lord▪keeper, Dr. Lee, and some others, the most sensible and moderate members of the house: but they were opposed with great vio∣lence by the lord viscount Coke, Henry Fox, Esq; Sir William Yonge, colonel Lyttleton, and the weight of the ministry; so that the motion for the order of the day was carried in the negative, and the high bailiff required to answer the question. Thus inter∣rogated, he declared, that he had been impeded in the scrutiny, and mal-treated, by Mr. Crowle, who had acted as counsel for Sir George Vandeput, by the
<PB N="103" REF="1050"/>
honourable Alexander Murray, brother to lord Eli∣bank,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> and one Gibson, an upholsterer, who had been very active, zealous, and turbulent in his en∣deavours to promote the interest of Sir George Vandeput, or rather to thwart the pretensions of the other candidate, who was supposed to be coun∣tenanced by the ministry. These three persons, thus accused, were brought to the bar of the house, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of se∣veral members, who opposed this method of pro∣ceeding as a species of oppression equally arbitrary and absurd. They observed, that, as no complaint had been preferred, they had no right to take cog∣nizance of the affair: that if any undue influence had been used, it would naturally appear when the merits of the election should fall under their in∣quiry: that a complaint having been lodged al∣ready against the returning officer, it was their duty to investigate his conduct, and punish him, if he should be found delinquent; but that nothing could be more flagrantly unjust, and apparently partial, than their neglecting the petitions of the other candidate and electors, and encouraging the high bailiff, who stood charged with iniquity, to recriminate upon his accusers, that they might be disabled from giving evidence on the inquiry into the merits of the election. What difference is it to the subject, whether he is oppressed by an arbitrary prince, or by the despotic insolence of a ministerial majority?</P>
<P>Mr. Crowle alledged, in his own vindication, that he had been employed as a counsel by the electors of Westminster, and attended the scrutiny in that character; that after the high bailiff had,
<PB N="104" REF="1060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> in the course of the last session, received the order of the house to expedite the election, he hurried on the scrutiny with such precipitation as, he appre∣hended, was unjust and prejudicial to his clients; that, in this apprehension, he (Mr. Crowle) insisted upon the high bailiff's proceeding with more deliberation, and in so doing he thought he did his duty to his employers. Some evidences being examined against him, declared he had not only protracted the scru∣tiny, but also spoken disrespectful words of the honourable house of commons: he was therefore reprimanded on his knees by the speaker, and dis∣charged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Mur∣ray sent prisoner to New∣gate.</NOTE> Mr. Murray being charged with having uttered some threatening and affrontive expressions, the house adjourned the consideration of this affair for some days, at the expiration of which Mr. Murray was to be heard by his counsel: but, in the mean time, they ordered him to be taken into custody by the serjeant at arms attending the house. This step, however, was not taken without a warm op∣position by some of the most sedate and intelligent members of the house, who considered it as a cruel act of oppression. They observed, that in cases of breach of privilege, no person complained of was ever taken into custody, until after he had been sully heard in his defence: that this was literally prejudging the cause before it had been examined; and the oppression was the greater as the alledged offence consisted intirely of words, of which no complaint or information had been made for above eight months after the supposed offence had been committed; and, even then, not till an accusation had been lodged against the informant, upon the
<PB N="105" REF="1070"/>
trial of which accusation the persons informed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> against might very probably be the most material witnesses. They observed, that in one of the high∣est offences which can be committed by words, namely, that of denying the king's right to the crown, or renouncing the Trinity, the information must be brought in three or four days after the words are spoken; the words must be proved to have been spoken maliciously, directly, and ad∣visedly, and the prosecution must commence in three months after the information. These sug∣gestions made no more impression than if they had been uttered in the desert. Those who were se∣cure in their number asserted, that the house of commons was not restricted by the forms of pro∣ceeding at common law; and that it was necessary to vindicate their own honour and dignity, by making examples of those who seemed to hold them in contempt. Mr. Murray was committed to the custody of the serjeant at arms, and found bail; and Gibson was sent prisoner to Newgate, from whence he was in a few days released, upon presenting an humble petition, professing his sor∣row for having incurred the displeasure of the house; to the bar of which he was brought, and received a reprimand on his knees from the speaker.</P>
<P>In the mean time, divers witnesses being exa∣mined before the house, declared, That Mr. Mur∣ray had been seen, about the time of the return of a member for Westminster, heading and exciting a tumult to acts of violence against the high bai∣liff. The majority, therefore, after a long and warm debate, agreed, That for his dangerous and
<PB N="106" REF="1080"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> seditious practices, in violation and contempt of the privileges of the house, and of the freedom of elections, he should be committed close prisoner to Newgate. Then, in the close of another vio∣lent debate, they resolved, That he should be brought to the bar of the house, to receive that sen∣tence on his knees. He accordingly appeared, and being directed by the speaker to kneel, refused to comply. He knew that he could not be dis∣charged from Newgate during the session, without petitioning, acknowledging his offence, and making such concessions as he thought would imply a con∣sciousness of guilt: he considered this whole trans∣action as an oppressive exertion of arbitrary power, and, being apprized of the extent of their autho∣rity, determined to bear the brunt of their indigna∣tion, rather than make submissions which he deemed beneath the dignity of his character. When he refused to humble himself, the whole house was in commotion: he was no sooner re∣moved from the bar than they resolved, That his having, in a most insolent and audacious manner, refused to be on his knees at the bar of that house, in consequence of their former resolution, was an high and most dangerous contempt of the autho∣rity and privilege of the commons: it was therefore ordered, that he should be committed close pri∣soner to Newgate, debarred the use of pen, ink, and paper; and that no person should have access to him, without the leave of the house. Finally, a committee was appointed to consider what me∣thods might be proper to be taken by them, in relation to this instance of contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="1090"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> Mean while, the petitioners against the return made by the high bailiff, perceiving the temper of the house, and the complexion of the majority, withdrew their petition; and the order, which had passed for hearing the merits of the election, was discharged.</P>
<P>Mr. Murray being taken dangerously ill in New∣gate, application was made to the commons, by some of his relations, that he might be removed to a more convenient situation; and his physician, being examined, gave it as his opinion, that he was in∣fected with the gaol distemper. Upon this repre∣sentation the house agreed, that the speaker should issue a warrant for removing him from Newgate to the custody of the serjeant at arms; but this favour he refused to accept, and expressed the warmest resentment against those relations who had applied to the commons in his behalf. Thus he remained sequestered, even from his own brother and sister, under the displeasure of the commons of England, who condescended so far as to make resolutions touching the physician, apothecary, and nurse who attended this prisoner. But the prorogation of parliament having put an end to their authority for that session, Mr. Murray was discharged of course, and conducted by the sheriffs from Newgate to his own house in procession, with flags and streamers exhibiting the emblems of liberty.</P>
<P>In the month of June the session was closed with a speech from the throne, in which his majesty thanked both houses for the zeal and affection they had manifested towards him and his government; and congratulated the commons in particular, upon their firmness and prudence in reducing the in∣terest

By this new law it was decreed▪ that the new year should begin on the first day of January; and that eleven intermediate nominal days, be∣tween the second and four∣teenth days of September, 1752, should for that time be omitted, so that the day suc∣ceeding the second should be denominated the fourteenth of that month. By this establish∣ment of the new stile, the equi∣noxes and solstices will happen nearly on the same nominal days on which they sell in the year 325, at the council of Nice; and the correspondence between the English merchants and those of foreign countries will be greatly facilitated, with respect to the dates of letters and accounts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enormous crimes prevail over all England.</NOTE> The interior oeconomy of Great Britain pro∣duced, within the circle of this year, nothing else worthy of historical regard, except a series of enor∣mous crimes, arising from the profligacy of indivi∣duals, which reflected disgrace upon the morals and the polity of the nation. Rapine and robbery had domineered without intermission ever since the return of peace, which was attended with a reduc∣tion of the army and navy; but now crimes of a deeper dye seemed to lift up their heads, in con∣tempt of law and humanity. An indulgent parent was poisoned by his only daughter, on whom, be∣sides other marks of tenderness and paternal affec∣tion, he had bestowed a liberal education, which greatly aggravated her guilt and ingratitude. An∣other young woman was concerned in the assassina∣tion of her own uncle, who had been her constant benefactor and sole guardian. A poor old woman,

having, from the ignorance and superstition of her<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> neighbours, incurred the suspicion of sorcery and witchcraft, was murdered in Hertfordshire by the populace, with all the wantonness of barbarity. Rape and murder were perpetrated upon an unfor∣tunate woman in the neighbourhood of London, and an innocent man suffered death for this com∣plicated outrage, while the real criminals assisted at his execution, heard him appeal to heaven for his innocence, and, in the character of friends, embraced him, while he stood on the brink of eter∣nity. Every day almost produced fresh instances of perjury, forgery, fraud, and circumvention; and the kingdom exhibited a most amazing jumble of virtue and vice, honour and infamy, compassion and obduracy, sentiment and brutality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the queen of Den∣mark, and of the prince of Orange.</NOTE> The royal family of England had sustained three severe shocks in the compass of a few months. Besides the loss of the prince of Wales, which the nation lamented as irreparable, his majesty was deeply afflicted by the untimely death of his young∣est daughter, the queen of Denmark, who died at Copenhagen on the nineteenth day of December, in the prime of youth and zenith of reputation. She was one of the most amiable princesses of the age in which she lived, whether we consider the virtues of her heart, or the accomplishments of her person; generous, mild, and tender-hearted; be∣loved, even almost to adoration, by her royal con∣sort, to whom she had borne a prince and two princesses; and universally admired and revered by the subjects of his Danish majesty. Her death had been preceded about two months by that of her brother-in-law the prince of Orange, no less

Though he had not distinguished himself by the lustre of a superior genius, he had been at great pains to cultivate his understanding, and study the true interest of that community of which he was a member. He had always approved himself a good and zealous citizen, and, since his elevation to the stadtholdership, taken many salu∣tary steps for the advantage of his country. Among other excellent schemes which he sug∣gested, he left a noble plan with the States General for restoring their commerce to its former lustre, and lived long enough to receive their warmest acknowledgments for this last proof of his pru∣dence and patriotism. His son and daughter being both infants, the administration of the government devolved upon the princess, as governante, during her son's minority; and as such she succeeded to all the power which her husband had enjoyed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Misunder∣standing between the Cza∣rina and the king of Prussia.</NOTE> With respect to the affairs of the continent, the peace of the North seemed still as precarious as ever: for though the difference between Russia and Sweden had been compromised, the mutual disgust between the Czarina and king of Prussia had gained such accession from reciprocal insults, ill offices, and inflammatory declarations, that these two powers seemed to be on the eve of a rupture, and each was employed in making extraordinary preparations for war.</P>
<P>The courts of Vienna and Great Britain, fore∣seeing that such a rupture would embroil the Em∣pire, and raise insurmountable obstructions to their favourite scheme of electing the archduke Joseph
<PB N="111" REF="1130"/>
king of the Romans, resolved to employ all their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> influence in order to effect a reconciliation between the courts of Petersburg and Berlin.</P>
<P>His Prussian majesty had signified to the king of Great Britain, and the States General, the situa∣tion in which he stood with the Czarina, and solli∣cited their interposition, that the difference might be amicably accommodated. At the same time he sent an envoy extraordinary to Versailles, to ne∣gotiate with the French king a very considerable body of auxiliaries, in case he should be attacked. These circumstances induced the Maritime Powers and the court of Vienna to use their utmost endea∣vours for the prevention of a rupture; and accord∣ingly they made remonstrances on this subject by their ministers at Petersburg, proposing, that the quarrel should be terminated without bloodshed, and all cause of animosity be buried in oblivion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prosecu∣tion of measures for elect∣ing a king of the Romans.</NOTE> In the mean time they eagerly prosecuted the design of the election; and the Imperial minister at Berlin not only communicated to his Prussian majesty the sentiments of the king of England on this expedient, but even sollicited his vote for the archduke Joseph, when the election of a king of the Romans should be proposed in the electoral college. To this proposal he replied, That he was extremely well disposed to manifest his regard for their Imperial majesties, and to give the most ge∣nuine proofs of it, even in the proposed election of a king of the Romans, considering the great me∣rit of the present candidate, the archduke Joseph: but he left it to the consideration of their Imperial majesties, whether the election would not be a little premature, if transacted at a time when his
<PB N="112" REF="1140"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> Imperial majesty was in the flower of his age, enjoy∣ing perfect health; and when all Europe, particu∣larly the Empire, was hushed within the bosom of tranquillity, so that no circumstance seemed to prog∣nosticate the necessity of such an election, or of put∣ting in execution the motives mentioned in the ca∣pitulation of the reigning emperor's election; espe∣cially as the examination of these motives belonged to the whole Empire, and ought to precede the election, by virtue of the eighth article of the treaty of Westphalia. He observed, that in case of the emperor's death, Germany would find her∣self in a very disagreeable situation, under the go∣vernment of a minor. For these reasons, he said, he could not help advising their Imperial majesties to wait until the archduke should be of age, when his election might be carried on more conformable to the laws and constitutions of the Empire, and more suitable to the majesty of the whole Germanic body.</P>
<P>This reply he circulated among the electors, and in particular transmitted it to the king of Great Britain, desiring they would deliberate maturely on this subject, and confer together in a body as well as in private, that they might proceed according to the antient custom of the electoral college, and take such measures as should be judged expedient for the honour and advantage of the community.</P>
<P>This circular letter was answered both by the king of England and the elector of Bavaria, who demonstrated, that it was the privilege of the elec∣toral college only, without any participation of the other princes of the Empire, to elect a king of the Romans during the life of the emperor, in order
<PB N="113" REF="1150"/>
to maintain the peace and preserve the liberties of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> Germany; and that the neglect of this wise pre∣caution hath produced bloody wars, and many fatal consequences to the Empire. They observed, that nothing could more contribute to the establish∣ment of the public tranquillity than this measure, so ardently desired by the majority of the German princes; and that, although the archduke Joseph wanted a few years of being of age, and it might possibly happen that the reigning Emperor should die during that prince's minority, it would be much less prejudicial to the Empire to have a minor chief, than to see the succession altogether un∣settled.</P>
<P>To the same purpose his Prussian majesty re∣ceived a declaration from the elector of Mentz; and understanding that this prince, as arch-chan∣cellor of the Empire, intended to convoke an electoral diet, in order to propose the election of the king of the Romans, he wrote an elaborate letter to his electoral highness, explaining, at more length, his reasons for postponing the election. He quoted that sentence of the treaty of Westpha∣lia which expresly declares, that the election of a king of the Romans shall be discussed and ordained by the common consent of the states of the Em∣pire; and therefore he could not conceive what right the electoral college had to arrogate this pri∣vilege to themselves, excluding the other states of the Empire. He observed, that the Imperial capi∣tulations, which were the only laws of the Empire that treated of this subject, mentioned only three cases in which it was lawful to proceed to such an election; namely, the Emperor's leaving and long
<PB N="114" REF="1160"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> absence from Germany; his advanced age, or an indisposition, rendering him incapable of managing the reins of government; and any case of emer∣gency in which the preservation of the Empire's prosperity is interested. He affirmed, that none of these motives at present existed: that, in case the Imperial crown should devolve to a minor, many mischiefs and disorders must ensue, as the constitu∣tions of the Empire have established no regula∣tions nor regency in that event: that an election of this nature, carried on under the power, influence, and authority of the head of the Empire, would strike at the fundamental privileges of the princes and states; consequently in time overturn the con∣stitution of the Empire, which, from being an elective dignity, conferred by the free and inde∣pendent suffrages of the electoral college and states of Germany, under certain capitulations, obliging the prince thus chosen to govern according to law, would become an hereditary succession, perpe∣tuated in one family, which, of course, must be aggrandized to the prejudice of its co-estates, and the ruin of the Germanic liberties.</P>
<P>In a word, all Germany in general, and Ratisbon in particular, was filled with writings, published on both sides: by the Emperor, and his adherents, to demonstrate, that the election of a king of the Romans, during the life of the Emperor, had often happened; and at this present time was necessary, and would be advantageous to the Empire: while the king of Prussia, and his friends, laboured to prove, that such an election, at the present junc∣ture, would be ill timed, irregular, and of danger∣ous consequence. Perhaps, if the truth was known,
<PB N="115" REF="1170"/>
this enterprising prince had projected some great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751▪</NOTE> scheme, with the execution of which this proposed establishment would have interfered. Certain it is, he exerted himself with that spirit and perse∣verance which are peculiar to his character, to frustrate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Vienna and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> particular, and was assisted with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the French ministry. Their joint endeavours were so effectual, that the elector of Cologne renounced his subsidiary treaty with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and once more threw himself into the arms of France. The elector Palatine, being sollicited by the Empress-queen and his Bri∣tannic majesty to co-operate with their views, in∣sisted, as a preliminary article, upon being indem∣nified by the court of Vienna for the ravages com∣mitted in his territories by the Austrian troops, during the course of the last war: the king of Po∣land, elector of Saxony, made the same demand of the like indemnification, which was granted by the mediation of king George; and then he subscribed to a subsidy-treaty, obliging himself to furnish a body of six thousand auxiliaries, in case they should be required by the Maritime Powers; and to act, as elector, in concert with the house of Austria, in every thing relating to the welfare of his country, that should square with the fundamental laws of the Empire.</P>
<P>The courts of London and Vienna had this election so much at heart, that they sounded almost all the powers of Europe, to know how they stood affected towards the measure proposed. The king of Spain declined intermeddling in a domestic affair of the Empire. The French king returned
<PB N="116" REF="1180"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> an ambiguous answer; from whence it was con∣cluded, that nothing but opposition could be ex∣pected from that quarter. The Swedish monarch was rendered propitious to the project by assu∣rances, that the house of Hesse Cassel, of which he was the head, should be elevated into an electorate. They even endeavoured to soften his Prussian ma∣jesty▪ by consenting, at last, that the treaty of Dres∣den, confirming to him the possession of Silesia, should be guarantied by the dyet of the Empire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sanction which he now actually obtained, toge∣ther with the ratification of his Imperial majesty. Notwithstanding this indulgence, he still persisted in raising fresh objections to the favourite project, on pretence of concerting measures for preventing the inconveniences that might result from a mino∣rity; for regulating the capitulations to be agreed on with the king of the Romans; securing the freedom of future elections, and preserving the prerogatives and privileges of the Germanic body in all its members.</P>
<P>In consequence of these obstacles, joined to the apostacy of the elector of Cologne, the obstinacy of the elector Palatine, and the approaching dyet of Hungary, at which their Imperial majesties were obliged personally to preside, the measures for the election were suspended till next summer, when his Britannic maje <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y was expected at Hanover, to put the finishing stroke to this great event in fa∣vour of the house of Austria.</P>
<P>Another disappointment, with respect to this election, the promoters of it sustained in the death of his Swedish majesty, who expired in a good old age, and was succeeded by Adolphus Frederic,
<PB N="117" REF="1190"/>
duke of Holstein Eutin, bishop of Lubeck, upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> whom the succession had been settled for some years by the unanimous concurrence of the states of the kingdom. This prince ascended the throne of Sweden without the least disturbance; and, of his own accord, took an oath in full senate, that he would never attempt to introduce a despotic au∣thority; but maintain their liberties with his blood, and govern his subjects in all respects according to the laws and the form of government established in Sweden. This public act, which was commu∣nicated to all the foreign ministers, and particu∣larly to the envoy from Petersbourg, met with such a favourable reception from the Czarina, that she expressed her satisfaction in a public declaration; and the good understanding between the two courts was perfectly restored.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> When the parliament of England was opened, in the month of November, the king, in his speech from the throne, gave them to understand, That, for the same purposes which suggested the treaty with the elector of Bavaria, he had now, in con∣junction with the States General, concluded an∣other with the king of Poland, elector of Saxony. He told them, that the unfortunate death of the prince of Orange had made no alteration in the state of affairs in Holland; and that he had received the strongest assurances from the States of their sirm resolution to maintain the intimate union and friendship happily subsisting between his majesty and those antient and natural allies of his crown. Finally, he exhorted both houses to consider seri∣ously of some effectual provisions to suppress those audacious crimes of robbery and violence, grown

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> so frequent about the capital, proceeding in a great measure from that profligate spirit of irreligion, idleness, gaming, and extravagance, which had of late extended itself in an uncommon degree, to the dishonour of the nation▪ and the great offence and prejudice of the sober and industrious part of the people. The paragraphs of this speech were, as usual, ecch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed back to the throne in addresses, replete with expressions of loyalty, affection, and approbation. Opposition was by this time almost extinguished; and the proceedings of both houses took place with such unanimity as was hardly ever known, before this period, in a British parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Animosi∣ty of the commons towards Mr. Mur∣ray.</NOTE> The commons, however▪ seem to have assembled with such sentiments as did no great honour to their temper and magnanimity. In a few days after the session opened, the lord viscount C—e, a young nobleman, whose character intitled him to very little regard or influence among men of sense and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> motion, that Mr. Murray, who had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> persecuted in the last session for refusing to humble himself on his knees before them, should be again committed close pri∣soner to Newgate for the same offence.</P>
<P>This proposal, which supposed a power that the commons had never before exercised, was sharply disputed by the earl of Eg—t, and others, who had n t resigned all sense of moderation; but the majority adopted the m asure with great eagerness, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was ordered to issue his warrant accordingly. Then the house resolved, That the said Alexander Murray should receive the sen∣tence, for his now being committed close prisoner to his majesty's gaol of Newgate, at the bar of the
<PB N="119" REF="1210"/>
house upon his knees; and the serjeant at arms<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> was commanded to take him into custody for this purpose.</P>
<P>Their indignation, however, was eluded by the caution of the delinquent, who, having foreseen the effects of their resentment, had prudently re∣tired to another country. They determined, never∣theless, to proceed against him as a person of some consequence in the commonwealth; for, being in∣formed of his retreat, they condescended so far as to present an address to his majesty, desiring that his royal proclamation might be issued for appre∣hending the said Mr. Murray, promising a reward to him who should have the good fortune to ap∣prehend this fugitive: a request with which his majesty most graciously complied.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings upon a pam∣phlet, in∣tituled, The Case of Mr. Murray.</NOTE> Nor was this the only address presented to the king upon such an important subject. A pam∣phlet, intituled, "The Case of the Hon. Alexander Murray, Esquire, in an Appeal to the People of Great Britain," was first stigmatized in a complaint to the house, and afterwards produced and read at the table. The piece was written with great acri∣mony, and abounded with severe animadversions, not only upon the conduct of the returning officer, but also on the proceedings of the commons. The violent members immediately took fire, and the flame extended itself to the majority. Nay, the house unanimously resolved, That the pam∣phlet was an impudent, malicious, scandalous, and seditious libel, falsely and most injuriously reflect∣ing upon and aspersing the proceedings of the house, tending to create misapprehensions in the minds of the people, to the great dishonour of the

They furthermore presented an address to the king, desiring his majesty would be graciously pleased to give directions to his attorney-general to prosecute the authors or author, the printers or printer, and the publishers or publisher of the said scandalous libel, in order that they might be brought to condign punishment.</P>
<P>Directions were accordingly given for this pur∣pose, and a prosecution commenced against the publisher, who had some reason to be dismayed, considering the great weight of influence he was doomed to encounter; influence arising from a prosecution of the crown, instituted at the request and founded on a vote of the house of commons. Nevertheless, when the cause was heard before the lord chief justice of England, a jury of free-born Englishmen, citizens of London, asserted their pri∣vilege of judging the law as well as the fact, and acquitted the defendant with a truly admirable spi∣rit of independency. They considered the pam∣phlet as an appeal against oppression; and, con∣vinced that the contents were true, they could not in conscience adjudge it a false libel, even though it had been so declared by one of the branches of the legislature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted.</NOTE> The commons, in regulating the supplies of the ensuing year, voted the cont nuation of eighteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven men for the land service, though not without some opposition from certain patriots, who, rather from a sense of duty than from any hope of influencing the majo∣rity, affirmed, that sixteen thousand men, in time of peace, would answer all the ends proposed by a

The number of seamen was fixed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE> at ten thousand: large sums were granted to make up deficiencies, and fulfil the engagements of the crown with the electors of Bavaria and Saxony, as well as for the maintenance of Nova Scotia and Georgia, and the castles on the coast of Guinea; and one hundred and twelve thousand one hundred and fifty-two pounds three shillings and three-pence were voted, as a full compensation to the old royal African company for their exclusive charter and property, to be applied for the relief of their cre∣ditors. These expences were defrayed by a conti∣nuation of the duties on malt, &amp;c. a land-tax, at three shillings in the pound; a duty on licences, to be yearly payed by pawnbrokers and dealers in second▪hand goods, within the bills of mortality; the sum of one million four hundred thousand pounds, advanced by the bank, according to a pro∣posal made for that purpose; five hundred thou∣sand pounds to be issued from the sinking fund; a duty laid on gum senega; and the continuation of divers other occasional impositions.

Nothing could be more salutary than the purposes of these regulations. The suburbs of the metropolis abounded with an incredible number of public houses, that continu∣ally resounded with the noise of riot and intempe∣rance: they were the haunts of idleness, fraud, and rapine; and the seminaries of drunkenness, debauchery, extravagance, and every vice incident to human nature: yet the suppression of these re∣ceptacles of infamy was attended with an inconve∣nience, which, in some cases, arose even to a degree of oppression. The justices being vested, by the legislature, with the power of granting or refusing licences, were constituted, in effect, the arbiters on whose decision the fortunes and livelihood of many individuals absolutely depended. Many of those who exercised this species of magistracy, within the bills of mortality, were, to the reproach of govern∣ment, men of profligate lives, ready, mean, igno∣rant, and rapacious, and often acted from the most scandalous principles of selfish avarice.</P>
<P>The law relating to the Highlands of Scotland was well calculated for promoting, among the in∣habitants of that country, such a spirit of industry
<PB N="123" REF="1250"/>
as might detach them from their dangerous con∣nexions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> and gradually supersede that military ge∣nius<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law re∣lating to the for∣feited estates in North Britain.</NOTE> which had been so productive of danger and alarm to the southern parts of Great Britain. The king, by this act, was impowered to appoint com∣missioners for managing the forfeited estates: these were enabled to grant leases of small farms, not above twenty pounds a year, to individuals, who should take the oaths to the government, to reside upon and cultivate the lands thus let. It was also provided, that no lease should be granted for a longer term than twenty-one years; and that the lessees should not pay above three-fourths of the annual value.</P>
<P>Although these forfeited estates were generally encumbered with claims beyond their real value, and the act directed that they should be disposed of by public sale; yet, as they lay in the most dis∣affected parts of the Highlands, it was thought ne∣cessary that they should remain in the possession of the crown, because, in case of their being publicly sold, they might be purchased in trust for the fami∣lies of the persons by whom they were forfeited, and thus the spirit of disaffection would still sur∣vive. A valuation, therefore, was made by the court of session in Scotland, at the joint suit of the crown and the creditors; and the value being as∣certained, the just claimants were, to that amount, paid out of the next aids granted by parliament.</P>
<P>The bill met with considerable opposition in the house of peers from the duke of Bedford and the earl of Bath, who probably foresaw that the good effects of this scheme, so laudable in itself, would be frustrated in the execution; and that the act, in∣stead
<PB N="124" REF="1260"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> of answering the purposes for which it was intended, would serve only as a job to gratify the rapacious retainers to the government, and their emissaries in that country. After a warm debate, however, it was adopted by a great majority, and obtained the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new consolida∣tion of certain funds.</NOTE> A third law related to certain articles of the na∣tional debt, which were now converted into several joint stocks of annuities, transferable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bank of England, to be charged on the linking fund. A great number of different funds for annuities, established at different times, and by different acts, at this period subsisted; so that it was necessary to keep many different accounts, which could not be regulated without considerable trouble and ex∣pence, for the removal of which the bill was cal∣culated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ports opened for the importa∣tion of Irish wool, &amp;c.</NOTE> In consequence of petitions from the woollen manufacturers of Westmoreland and Yorkshire, two bills were brought in, and passed through both houses, by which the ports of Lancaster and Great Yarmouth were opened for the importation of wool and woollen yarn from Ireland; but why this pri∣vilege was not extended to all the frequented ports of the kingdom it is not easy to conceive, without supposing a little national jealousy on one hand, and a great deal of grievous restraint on the other.</P>
<P>Over and above these new laws, some unsuccess∣ful endeavours were used in behalf of commerce and police. A bill was offered for laying further restrictions on pawnbrokers and brokers, that they might no longer suck the blood of the poor, and act as the accessaries of theft and robbery. It was canvassed, debated, and made its way through the
<PB N="125" REF="1270"/>
lower house; but the lords rejected it as a crude<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> scheme, which they could not amend, because it was a money-bill, not cognizable by their house, unless they should determine to engage in a dispute with the commons.</P>
<P>Another bill was prepared for giving power to change the punishment of felony, in certain cases, to confinement and hard labour in dock-yards or garrisons. There cannot be a greater solecism in law, nor a more flagrant error in civil government, than the practice of inflicting the same punishment on crimes of different complexions, essentially dif∣ferent in the degrees of guilt, as well as in their consequences to the community. What, for ex∣ample, can be more repugnant to the fundamental principles of justice, as well as to the sagacity of civil regulation, than the undistinguishing institu∣tion which decrees the same penalty against the felon who robs his neighbour of five shillings, and the execrable homicide who murders his benefac∣tor? It was the opinion of many who wished well to their country, and were properly qualified to prosecute such inquiries, that the practice of con∣signing such a number of wretches to the hands of the executioner, served only, by its frequency, to defeat the purpose of law, in robbing death of all its terror, and the public of many subjects, who might, notwithstanding their delinquency, be in some measure rendered useful to society. Such was the motive that influenced the promoters of this bill; by which it was proposed, in imitation of that oeconomy practised in other countries, to confine felons convicted, under certain circumstances, to hard labour upon the public works of the king∣dom.
<PB N="126" REF="1280"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> The scheme was adopted by the lower house, but rejected by the lords, who seemed ap∣prehensive of its bringing such discredit upon his majesty's dock-yards as would discourage persons, who valued their reputation, from engaging in such employment. This objection, however, was a meer conjecture, unsupported by evidence and expe∣rience, and not very plausible in point of probabi∣lity. We know that slaves and felons are em∣ployed in public works by other nations, without producing any such consequences: nor can we con∣ceive how the character of a reputable workman should be affected by the service of a malefactor, so evidently distinguished from a free subject by the badges of infamy and slavery.</P>
<P>Of still greater importance to the nation was the next measure proposed, in a bill for making the militia of England more useful, presented by Mr. Thornton, a gentleman of Yorkshire, who had distinguished himself by his loyalty and patriotism. It was canvassed in a committee of the whole house, and underwent divers amendments; but miscar∣ried, through the aversion of the ministry to any project tending to remove or lessen the necessity of maintaining a standing army.</P>
<P>A considerable number of petitions for different regulations, in respect to commerce and conve∣nience of traffic, were presented, considered, and left upon the table.</P>

they examined that remarkable personage who had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> signalized himself in different parts of Christen∣dom, under the name of Theodore king of Corsi∣ca. Though formerly countenanced, and even treated as a sovereign prince by the British mini∣stry, he was now reduced to the forlorn condition of a confined debtor; and, to the reproach of this kingdom, died in prison, surrounded with all the misery of indigence, and overwhelmed with the infirmities of old age.</P>
<P>But the most remarkable circumstance of the parliamentary transactions that distinguished this session, was a motion made in both houses for an address to the king, beseeching his majesty, That, in time of public tranquillity, he would be graci∣ously pleased to avoid entering into subsidiary trea∣ties with foreign princes, which are so burthensome to this nation. This extraordinary proposal was made and strenuously urged by the duke of B—, and a vehement debate ensued, in which the earls of G—, S—, and H—, opposed it with an exertion of superior abilities; and the question being put, was carried in the negative, without a division. The same fate attended it in the house of commons, where it was introduced by lord H—y, and sup∣ported by some distinguished orators.</P>
<P>Finally, the session expired in the latter end of March, when his majesty, having given his assent to ninety five public and private bills, harangued both houses, and prorogued the parliament <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Among the proceedings of this session it may not be improper to mention a new act for the prevention of mur∣ders, which had been shock∣ingly frequent of late, import∣ing, That every criminal con∣victed of this horrid crime should be executed in one day after his sentence, and his body be delivered to the sur∣geons for dissection: an expe∣dient which, how ineffectual soever it may appear in theory, hath been found in practice productive of very salutary consequences.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> Immediately after the prorogation the king ap∣pointed<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king sets out for Hano∣ver.</NOTE> a regency, and set out for Hanover, in order to complete the great scheme he had pro∣jected for electing a king of the Romans. Great Britain, in the mean time, produced no event of importance, or any transaction that deserves histo∣rical mention, except the ratification of two treaties of peace and commerce with the states of Tripoli and Tunis on the coast of Barbary, concluded by the British consuls in those cities, under the in∣fluence and auspices of an English squadron, com∣manded by commodore Keppel, son to the earl of Albemarle.</P>
<P>The tide of luxury still flowed with an impe∣tuous current, bearing down all the mounds of temperance and decorum; while fraud and profli∣gacy struck out new channels, through which they eluded the restrictions of the law, and all the vigi∣lance of civil policy. New arts of deception were invented, in order to ensnare and ruin the unwary; and some infamous practices, in the way of com∣merce, were countenanced by persons of rank and importance in the commonwealth. A certain member of parliament was obliged to withdraw himself from his country, in consequence of a dis∣covery, by which it appeared that he had contrived and executed schemes for destroying his own ships at sea, with a view to defraud the insurers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the conti∣nent.</NOTE> In the course of this year the affairs of the con∣tinent did not undergo any material alteration. In
<PB N="129" REF="1310"/>
France the religious dispute concerning the doc∣trine<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> of Jansenius, still subsisted between the clergy and the parliament; and seemed to acquire addi∣tional fuel from the violence of the archbishop of Paris, an haughty turbulent prelate, whose pride and bigotry were sufficient to embroil one half of Christendom. The northern powers enjoyed a per∣fect tranquillity: the States General of the United Provinces were engrossed by plans of national oeco∣nomy. Spain was intent upon extending her com∣merce, bringing her manufactures to perfection, and repressing the insolence of the Barbary Corsairs: his Portuguese majesty endeavoured, by certain peremptory precautions, to check the exportation of gold coin from his dominions; and insisted upon inspecting the books of the British merchants set∣tled at Lisbon; but they refused to comply with this demand, which was contrary to a treaty sub∣sisting between the two crowns; and he thought proper to acquiesce in their refusal. He was much better employed in obtaining from the Pope an abolition of the annual procession called the Auto da fe, one of the most horrid triumphs of spiritual tyranny. The peace of Italy was secured by a de∣fensive treaty concluded at Madrid between the Emperor, his Catholic majesty, the king of the Two Sicilies, and the duke of Parma; to which treaty the king of Sardinia afterwards acceded.</P>
<P>With respect to the great scheme of electing the archduke Joseph king of the Romans, fresh ob∣jections seemed to rise from different quarters. The good understanding between the courts of Berlin and Hanover received an additional shock, from a dispute concerning the property of East Friesland,
<PB N="130" REF="1320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> which his Prussian majesty had secured as heir to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute between Hanover and Prus∣sia, con∣cerning East Fries∣land.</NOTE> the last possessor. His Britannic majesty, as elector of Hanover, having pretensions to the same inhe∣ritance, his minister delivered a memorial to the dyet of the Empire, assembled at Ratisbon, de∣manding that the king of Prussia, as elector of Brandenburg, should be referred to the decision of the Aulic council, in regard to his claim to the estates of East Friesland: but the king being al∣ready in possession, refused to submit his right to the determination of that or any other tribunal; and when the dyet presumed to deliberate on this affair, his envoy entered a strong protest against their proceedings. At the same time he presented the other ministers with a memorial, tending to re∣fure the elector of Hanover's pretensions to the principality in question.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Misun∣derstand∣ing be∣tween the courts of London and Ber∣lin.</NOTE> At this juncture his Prussian majesty made no scruple of expressing his resentment against the court of London, which he seemed to consider as an officious cabal, that had no right to intermeddle in the affairs of Germany. His resident at Lon∣don complained to the British ministry, that divers ships, sailing under the Prussian flag, had been stopped at sea, and even seized by English cruisers; and that his subjects had been ill-treated and op∣pressed: he therefore demanded reparation in a peremptory tone; and, in the mean time, discon∣tinued the payment of the Silesian loan, which he had charged himself with by an article in the treaty of Breslau. This was a sum of money amounting to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which the emperor Charles VI. father of the reigning Empress, had borrowed of the subjects of Great
<PB N="131" REF="1330"/>
Britain, on condition of paying an interest of six<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752▪</NOTE> per centum, and mortgaging the silver mines of Silesia for the repayment of the principal. These devolved to the king of Prussia with this incum∣brance, and he continued to pay the interest punc∣tually till this juncture, when the payment was stopped; and he published a paper, intituled, An Exposition of the Motives which influenced his Conduct on this Occasion. In his memorial to the ministry of Great Britain he alledged, That eigh∣teen Prussian ships, and thirty-three neutral vessels, in which the subjects of Prussia were concerned, had been unjustly seized by English privateers: his account of damages amounted to a very consi∣derable sum; and he demanded, in the most dog∣matic terms, that the affair should be finally dis∣cussed in the term of three months from the date of his remonstrance. The Exposition and Memo∣rial were subjected to the examination of the ablest civilians in England, who refuted ever article of the charge with equal precision and perspicuity. They proved, that captures by sea fell properly un∣der the cognizance of those powers under whose jurisdiction the seizures were made; and, therefore, his Prussian majesty could not, consistent with the law of nations, determine these disputes in his own tribunals. They demonstrated, by undoubted evi∣dence, the falsity of many facts alledged in the me∣morial, as well as the fairness of the proceedings by which some few of the Prussian vessels had been condemned; and made it appear, that no insult or injury had been offered to the subjects of Prussia. Finally, they observed, that the Silesia loan was a private transaction of such a nature, that, even if a
<PB N="132" REF="1340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> war had happened between the emperor Charles VI. and his Britannic majesty, this must have been held sacred and inviolable: that when the Empress-queen ceded Silesia to the king of Prussia, this monarch charged himself with the repayment of the loan, which, being a private debt, and trans∣ferable, was now diffused into different countries, and become the property of many others besides the subjects of Great Britain. They wound up their chain of reasoning by observing, that, according to agreement with the Emperor, the whole of this loan should have been repayed in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and forty-five; whereas the complaints specified in the Prussian memorial were founded on facts posterior to that period.</P>
<P>Whether his Prussian majesty was convinced by these reasons, and desisted from principle, or he thought proper to give up his claim upon other political considerations; certain it is, he no longer insisted upon satisfaction, but ordered the pay∣ments of the Silesia loan to be continued without further interruption: a report, indeed, was circu∣lated, that advantage had been taken of the demur by a certain prince, who employed his agents to buy up great part of the loan at a considerable discount.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Improve∣ment of Pomera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia.</NOTE> How much soever the king of Prussia may be the subject of censure on this occasion, it must be allowed, that, with regard to his own subjects, he acted as a wise legislator, and the father of his country. He peopled the deserts of Pomerania, by encouraging, with royal bounties, a great number of industrious emigrants to settle in that province; the face of which, in a very few years, underwent
<PB N="133" REF="1350"/>
the most agreeable alteration. Above sixty new vil∣lages<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752▪</NOTE> arose amidst a barren waste, and every part of the country exhibited marks of successful culti∣vation. Those solitary and desolate plains, where no human footsteps had for many ages been seen, were now converted into fields of corn. The farms were regularly parcelled out: the houses multi∣plied, and teemed with population: the happy peasants, sheltered in a peculiar manner under their king's protection, sowed their grounds in peace, and reaped their harvests in security. The same care and indulgence were extended to the unpeo∣pled parts of other provinces within the Prussian dominions; and extraordinary encouragement was granted to all French protestants who should come and settle under the government of this political sage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with the elector Palatine.</NOTE> The courts of Vienna and Hanover still em∣ployed their chief attention upon the scheme of electing a king of the Romans; and the elector of Mentz, influenced by the majority of the college, had convoked an electoral dyet for that purpose: but strong protests against this convocation were entered by the electors of Cologne and Palatine, insomuch that it was thought expedient to conci∣liate this last by taking some steps in his favour, with respect to the satisfaction he demanded from the Empress queen and his Britannic majesty. His claim upon the court of Vienna amounted to three millions of florins, by way of indemnification for the losses he had sustained during the war. He demanded of the king of England twenty thousand pounds sterling, for provision and forage furnished to the British troops while they acted on the Maine;
<PB N="134" REF="1360"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> and the like sum for the like purposes from the States General of the United Provinces. The Empress-queen could not help remonstrating against this demand as exorbitant in itself, and the more unreasonable as the elector Palatine, at the death of her father, had openly declared against the pragmatic sanction, which he had guarantied in the most solemn manner: she therefore observed, that the damage he had sustained, in consequence of that declaration, ought to be considered as the common fate of war. These reasons, though con∣clusive and irre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragable in the usual way of arguing, made no impression upon the Palatine, who per∣fectly well understood his own importance, and was determined to seize this opportunity of turn∣ing it to the best advantage.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna, and the Maritime Powers, finding him thus obstinately attached to his own interest, resolved to bring him over to their views at any rate, and commenced a negotiation with him, which produced a formal treaty. By this convention his demands in money were fixed at twelve hundred thousand Dutch florins, to be payed at three instalments, five hundred thousand by the Em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> queen, and the remaining seven hundred thousand by the king of Great Britain and the States General, according to the proportion esta∣blished in former tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties. The privilege of Non ap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellando, for the dutchy of Deux-ponts, was con∣firmed to his electoral highness, together with some other rights and pretensions, in consideration of his concurring with the other electors in the choice of a king of the Romans, to be elected according to the customs prescribed by the laws and consti∣tutions
<PB N="135" REF="1370"/>
of the Empire. He likewise engaged to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> join them in settling the articles of the capitula∣tion with the king of the Romans, emperor in futuro. Yet, even after the concurrence of this prince was secured, the purposed election proved abortive, from the strong objections that were started and the strenuous opposition which was made by his Prussian majesty, who perhaps aspired in secret at the Imperial dignity, which the Em∣press-queen took all this pains to perpetuate in her own family.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The king of Great Britain, returning from the continent, opened the session of parliament on the eleventh day of January with a speech, importing, That all his views and negotiations had been cal∣culated and directed to preserve and secure the du∣ration of the general peace, so agreeable and ne∣cessary to the welfare of all Europe: That he had the satisfaction to be assured of a good disposition in all the powers, that were his allies, to adhere to the same salutary object. He exhorted them to continue their attention to the reduction of the national debt, the augmentation of the sinking fund, and the improvement of the public revenue. He recommended to their serious consideration what further laws and regulations might be neces∣sary for suppressing those crimes and disorders, of which the public had so justly complained: and concluded with an assurance, that his hearty con∣currence and endeavours should never be wanting in any measure that might promote their welfare and prosperity.</P>
<P>The addresses, in answer to this speech, were couched in the usual form of implicit approba∣tion;
<PB N="136" REF="1380"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> but that of the commons did not pass with∣out question. The earl of E—took exceptions to one paragraph, in which they acknowledged his majesty's wisdom, as well as goodness, in pursuing such measures as must contribute to maintain and render permanent the general tranquillity in Eu∣rope; and declared their satisfaction at the assu∣rances his majesty had received from his allies, that they were all attached to the same salutary object. His lordship expatiated on the absurdity of these compliments at such a juncture, when the peace of Europe was so precarious, and the English nation had so much cause of complaint and dissatisfaction. He was seconded by some other individuals, who declaimed with great vivacity against continental connections; and endeavoured to expose the weak∣ness and folly of the whole system of foreign mea∣sures, which our ministry had lately pursued.</P>
<P>It must be owned, indeed, that they might have chosen a better opportunity to compliment their sovereign on the permanency of the peace than at this juncture, when they must have seen them∣selves at the very brink of a new rupture with the most formidable power in Europe. But the truth is, these addresses to the throne had been long con∣sidered as compliments of course, implying no more than a respectful attachment to their sove∣reign: accordingly both houses agreed to their respective addresses without division.</P>
<P>The two grand committees of supply and of ways and means being established, the business of the house was transacted without much altercation; and the people had great reason to be satisfied with their moderate proceedings. Ten thousand sea∣men,
<PB N="137" REF="1390"/>
and the usual number of land-forces, were<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> retained for the service of the ensuing year. They provided for the maintenance of the new colony in Nova▪Scotia, the civil establishment of Georgia, the support of the castles on the coast of Guinea, and the erection of a new fort at Anamaboa, where the French had attempted to make a settlement; and they enabled his majesty to fulfil his engage∣ments with the king of Poland and the elector of Bavaria.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies for the ensuing year.</NOTE> The supplies, including grants for former defi∣ciencies and services, for which no provision had been made in the course of the last year, did not exceed two millions one hundred thirty-two thou∣sand seven hundred and seven pounds seventeen shillings and two-pence half-penny; in order to de∣fray which expence they assigned the duty on malt, &amp;c. the land-tax at two shillings in the pound, the surplus of certain funds in the Exchequer, and the sum of four hundred and twenty thousand pounds out of the sinking fund; so that the exceedings amounted to near three hundred thousand pounds. Several duties on salt, as well as on red and white herrings delivered out for home consumption, were rendered perpetual, though subject to be redeemed by parliament; and it was provided, that the debt contracted upon these duties being discharged, all the after-produce of them should become part of the sinking fund.</P>
<P>As for the national debt, it now stood at the enormous sum of seventy-four millions three hun∣dred sixty-eight thousand four hundred and fifty∣one pounds fifteen shillings and one penny; and the sinking fund produced one million seven hun∣dred

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> thirty-five thousand five hundred and twenty-nine pounds six shillings and ten-pence farthing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Game∣act.</NOTE> One of the first measures brought upon the car∣pet, in the course of this session, was an act con∣taining regulations for the better preservation of the game, of which so great havock had been made by poachers, and other persons unqualified to en∣joy that diversion, that the total extirpation of it was apprehended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for perform∣ing qua∣rentine.</NOTE> The next step taken by the commons was an affair of much greater consequence to the commu∣nity, being a bill for obliging ships the more ef∣fectually to perform quarentine, in order to prevent the plague from being imported from foreign countries into Great Britain. For this purpose it was ordained, that if this dreadful visitation should appear in any ship to the northward of Cape Fi∣nisterre, the master or commander should imme∣diately proceed to the harbour of New Grimsby, in one of the islands of Scilly, and there communi∣cate the discovery to some officer of the customs; who should, with the first opportunity, transmit this intelligence to another custom-house officer in the nearest port of England, to be by him for∣warded to one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state. In the mean time the ship should remain at the said island, and not an individual presume to go ashore, until his majesty's pleasure should be known. It was also provided, that in case the master of a ship, thus infected, should not be able to make the islands of Scilly, or be forced up either channel by violent winds, he should not enter any frequented harbour; but remain in some open road, until he could receive orders from his ma∣jesty,
<PB N="139" REF="1410"/>
or the privy-council: that, during this in∣terval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> he should avoid all intercourse with the shore, or any person or vessel whatsoever, on pain of being deemed guilty of felony, and suffering death without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for prevent∣ing the plunder∣ing of ship∣wrecked vessels.</NOTE> In order the more effectually to repress the bar∣barous practice of plundering ships, which have the misfortune to suffer shipwreck; a practice which prevailed upon many different parts of the British coast, to the disgrace of the nation, and the scandal of human nature; a bill was prepared, containing clauses to enforce the laws against such savage delinquents, who prowl along the shore, like hungry wolves, in hope of preying upon their fellow-creatures; and certain provisions for the relief of the unhappy sufferers. By this new law the clerk of the peace, in the county where the crime shall be committed, is obliged, upon re∣ceiving proper information, to prosecute the of∣fenders at the expence of the county. It was like∣wise proposed, that in case no prosecution of this nature should be commenced within a certain limited time, after the information should have been legally given, in that case the county might be sued by the person who had sustained the da∣mage, and obliged to indemnify him for his loss: but this clause was rejected by the majority; and the bill, having made its way through both houses, received the royal assent.</P>
<P>When the mutiny-bill fell under deliberation, the earl of Egmont proposed a new clause for im∣powering and requiring regimental courts-martial to examine witnesses, upon oath, in all their trials. The proposal occasioned a debate, in which the
<PB N="140" REF="1420"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> ministry were pretty equally divided; but the clause was disapproved by the majority, and this annual bill was enacted into a law without any al∣teration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another relating to the bounty on export∣ed corn.</NOTE> The next bill was framed in consequence of di∣vers petitions presented by the exporters of corn, who complained that the bounties were not payed, and prayed, that the house would make proper provision for that purpose. A bill was accordingly brought in, importing, That interest, after the rate of three per centum, should be allowed upon every debenture for the bounty on the exportation of corn, payable by the general receiver or cashier of the customs, until the principal could be discharged out of such customs or duties as are appropriated for the payment of this bounty. This premium on the exportation of corn ought not to be grant∣ed, except when the lowness of the market-price in Great Britain proves that there is a superabundance in the kingdom; otherwise the exporter will find his account in depriving our own labourers of their bread, in order to supply our rivals at an easier rate: for example, suppose wheat in England should sell for twenty shillings a quarter, the merchant might export it to France, and afford it to the people of that kingdom for eighteen shillings, because the bounty on exportation would, even at that rate, afford him a considerable advantage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade to Turkey laid open.</NOTE> A great number of merchants having presented petitions from different parts of the kingdom, re∣presenting, that the trade to Turkey was greatly decreased, ascribing this diminution to the exclu∣sive charter enjoyed by a monopoly, and praying, that the trade might be laid open to all his ma∣jesty's

subjects, one of the members for Liverpool<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> moved for leave to bring in a bill for this purpose. Such a measure had been twice before proposed without success; but now it was adopted without opposition. A bill was immediately introduced; and, notwithstanding all the interest and efforts of the Turkey company, who petitioned the house against it, and were heard by their counsel, it passed through both houses, and received the royal sanc∣tion. By this regulation any British subject may obtain the freedom of the Turkey company, by paying or tendering a fine of twenty pounds; and all the members are secured from the tyranny of oppressive bye-laws, contrived by any monopo∣lizing cabal. This indulgence, however, and even all the encouragement which the legislature can bestow, will never retrieve the trade of Turkey or the Levant, while the heavy load of taxes disables the manufacturer from affording his commodity so cheap as it can be supplied by our rivals in com∣merce, who neither groan under such burthens, nor pay such a price for labour.</P>
<P>Several other bills were passed: one for regu∣lating the number of public houses, and the more easy conviction of persons selling ale and strong liquors without licence; an act which impowered the justices of peace to tyrannize over their fellow subjects: a second, enabling the magistrates of Edinburgh to improve, enlarge, and adorn the avenues and streets of that city, according to a concerted plan, to be executed by voluntary sub∣scription: a third, allowing the exportation of wool and woollen yarn from Ireland to any port in Great Britain: and a fourth, prescribing the breadth of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naturali∣zation of the Jews.</NOTE> But this session was chiefly distinguished by an act for naturalizing Jews, and a bill for the better pre∣venting clandestine mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iages. The first of these, which passed without much opposition in the house of lords, from whence it descended to the commons, was intituled, "An Act to permit Persons profess∣ing the Jewish religion to be naturalized by Parlia∣ment, and for other Purposes therein mentioned." It was supported by some petitions of merchants and manufacturers, who, upon examination, ap∣peared to be Jews, or their dependants; and coun∣tenanced by the ministry, who thought they fore∣saw, in the consequences of such a naturalization, a great accession to the moneyed interest, and a con∣siderable increase of their own influence among the individuals of that community. They boldly af∣firmed, that such a law would greatly conduce to the advantage of the nation; that it would encou∣rage persons of wealth to remove with their effects from foreign parts into Great Britain, increase the commerce and the credit of the kingdom, and set a laudable example of industry, temperance, and frugality. Such, however, were not the senti∣ments of the lord-mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city of London in common council assem∣bled, who, in a petition to parliament, expressed their apprehension that the bill, if passed into a law, would tend greatly to the dishonour of the christian religion, endanger the excellent constitu∣tion, and be highly prejudicial to the interest and trade of the kingdom in general, and of the city of
<PB N="143" REF="1450"/>
London in particular. To the same purpose an∣other<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> petition was next day presented to the house, subscribed by merchants and traders of the city of London; who, among other allegations, observed, that the consequences of such a naturalization would greatly affect their trade and commerce with foreign nations, particularly with Spain and Portugal. Counsel was heard, evidence examined, and the bill produced violent debates, in which there seemed to be more passion than patriotism, more declamation than argument.</P>
<P>The adversaries of the bill affirmed, that such a naturalization would deluge the kingdom with brokers, usurers, and beggars; that the rich Jews, under the shadow of this indulgence, would pur∣chase lands, and even advowsons; so as not only to acquire an interest in the legislature, but also to influence the constitution of the church of Christ, to which they were the inveterate and pro∣fessed enemies: that the lower class of that nation, when thus admitted to the right of denisons, would interfere with the industrious natives, who earn their livelihood by their labour; and by dint of the most parsimonious frugality, to which the English are strangers, work at an under-price; so as not only to share, but even in a manner to exclude them from all employment: that such an adoption of vagrant Jews into the community, from all parts of the world, would rob the real subjects of their birthright, disgrace the character of the nation, ex∣pose themselves to the most dishonourable partici∣pation and intrusion, endanger the constitution both in church and state, and be an indelible reproach upon the established religion of the country. Some
<PB N="144" REF="1460"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> of these orators seemed transported even to a degree of enthusiasm. They prognosticated that the Jews would multiply so much in number, engross such wealth, and acquire so great power and influence in Great Britain, that their persons would be revered, their customs imitated, and Judaism become the fashionable religion of the English. Finally, they affirmed that such an act was directly flying in the face of the prophecy, which declares, that the Jews shall be a scattered people, without country or fixed habitation, until they shall be converted from their infidelity, and gathered together in the land of their forefathers. These arguments and appre∣hensions, which were in reality frivolous and chi∣merical, being industriously circulated among the vulgar, naturally prejudiced against the Jewish peo∣ple, excited such a ferment throughout the nation, as ought to have deterred the ministry from the prosecution of such an unpopular measure; which, however, they had courage enough to maintain against all opposition. The bill passed the ordeal of both houses, and his majesty vouchsafed the royal sanction to this law in favour of the Hebrew nation. The truth is, it might have increased the wealth, and extended the commerce of Great Britain, had it been agreeable to the people; and as the natu∣ralized Jews would still have been excluded from all civil and military offices, as well as from other privileges enjoyed by their christian brethren, in all probability, they would have gradually forsaken their own unprofitable and obstinate infidelity, opened their eyes to the shining truths of the gos∣pel, and joined their fellow-subjects in embracing the doctrines of Christianity. But no ministry
<PB N="145" REF="1470"/>
ought to risk an experiment, how plausible soever<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753▪</NOTE> it may be, if they find it, as this was, an object of the people's unconquerable aversion. What render∣ed this unpopular measure the more impolitic, was the unseasonable juncture at which it was carried into execution; that is, at the eve of a general elec∣tion for a new parliament; when a minister ought carefully to avoid every step which may give um∣brage to the body of the people. The earl of Eg—t, who argued against the bill with equal power and vivacity, in describing the effect it might have upon that occasion, "I am amazed, (said he) that this consideration makes no impres∣sion.—When that day, which is not far off, shall arrive, I shall not sear to set my foot upon any ground of election in the kingdom, in opposition to any one man among you, or any new Christian who has voted or appeared in favour of this natu∣ralization."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act.</NOTE> Another bill, transmitted from the upper-house, met with a reception equally unfavourable among the commons, though it was sustained on the shoulders of the majority, and thus forced its way to the throne, where it obtained the royal appro∣bation. The practice of solemnizing clandestine marriages, so prejudicial to the peace of families, and so often productive of misery to the parties themselves thus united, was an evil that prevailed to such a degree, as claimed the attention of the legislature. The sons and daughters of great and opulent families, before they had acquired know∣ledge and experience, or attained to the years of discretion, were every day seduced in their affec∣tions, and inveigled into matches big with infamy
<PB N="146" REF="1480"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> and ruin; and these were greatly facilitated by the opportunities that occurred of being united in∣stantaneously by the ceremony of marriage, in the first transport of passion, before the destined victim had time to cool or deliberate on the subject. For this pernicious purpose there was a band of profligate miscreants, the refuse of the clergy, dead to every sentiment of virtue, abandoned to all sense of decency and decorum, for the most part prisoners for debt or delinquency, and indeed the very outcasts of human society, who hovered about the verge of the Fleet-prison to intercept customers, plying like porters for employment, and performed the ceremony of marriage without li∣cence or question; in cellars, garrets, or alehouses, to the scandal of religion, and the disgrace of that order which they professed. The ease with which this ecclesiastical sanction was obtained, and the vicious disposition of those wretches, open to the practices of fraud and corruption, were productive of polygamy, indigence, conjugal infidelity, pro∣stitution, and every curse that could imbitter the married state.</P>
<P>A remarkable case of this nature having fallen under the cognizance of the peers, in an appeal from an inferior tribunal, that house ordered the judges to prepare a new bill for preventing such abuses; and one was accordingly framed, under the auspices of lord H—, at that time lord high chancellor of England. In order to antici∣pate the bad effects of clandestine marriages, this new statute enacted, That the banns should be re∣gularly published, three successive Sundays, in the church of the parish where the parties dwell:
<PB REF="1490"/>

That no licence should be granted to marry in any<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> place, where one of the parties has not dwelt at least a month, except a special licence by the arch∣bishop: That if any marriage should be solemnized in any other place than a church, or a chapel, without a special licence, or in a public chapel, without having published the banns, or obtained a licence of some person properly qualified, the mar∣riage should be void, and the person who solem∣nized it transported for seven years: That mar∣riages, by licence, of parties under age, without consent of parent or guardian, should be null and void, unless the party under age be a widow, and the parent refusing consent a widow married again: That when the consent of a mother or guardian is refused from caprice, or such parent or guardian be non compos mentis, or beyond sea, the minor should have recourse for relief to the court of Chan∣cery: That no suit should be commenced to com∣pel a celebration of marriage, upon pretence of any contract: That all marriages should be solemnized before two witnesses, and an entry be made in a book, kept for that purpose, whether it was by banns or licence, whether either of the parties was under age, or the marriage celebrated with the consent of parent or guardian; and this entry to be signed by the minister, the parties, and the wit∣nesses: That a false licence or certificate, or de∣stroying register-books, should be deemed felony, either in principal or accessary, and punished with death.</P>
<P>The bill, when first considered in the lower house, gave rise to a variety of debates; in which the members appeared to be divided rather accord∣ing
<PB N="148" REF="1510"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> to their real sentiments, than by the rules of any political distinction: for some principal servants of the government freely differed in opinion from the minister, who countenanced the bill; while, on the other hand, he was, on this occasion, supported by certain chiefs of the opposition, and the disputes were maintained with extraordinary eagerness and warmth. The principal objections imported, that such restrictions on marriage would damp the spi∣rit of love and propagation; promote mercenary matches, to the ruin of domestic happiness, as well as to the prejudice of posterity and population; impede the circulation of property, by preserving the wealth of the kingdom among a kind of aristo∣cracy of opulent families, who would always inter∣marry within their own pale; subject the poor to many inconveniences, and extraordinary expence, from the nature of the forms to be observed; and throw an additional power into the hands of the chancellor. They affirmed, that no human power had a right to dissolve a vow solemnly made in the fight of heaven; and that, in proportion as the bill prevented clandestine marriages it would en∣courage fornication and debauchery, inasmuch as the parties restrained from indulging their mutual passions in an honourable manner, would be tempt∣ed to gratify them by stealth, at the hazard of their reputation. In a word, they foresaw a great num∣ber of evils in the train of this bill, which have not yet been realized. On the other side, its advo∣cates endeavoured to refute these arguments, and some of them spoke with great strength and preci∣sion. The bill underwent a great number of alte∣rations and amendments, which were not effected
<PB N="149" REF="1520"/>
without violent contest and altercation. At length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> however, it was floated through both houses on the tide of a great majority, and steered into the fafe harbour of royal approbation.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the abuse of clandestine marriage might have been removed upon much easier terms than those imposed upon the subject by this bill▪ which, after all, hath been found ineffectual, as it may be easily eluded by a short voyage to the con∣tinent, or a moderate journey to North Britain, where the indissoluble knot may be tied without scruple or interruption.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Delibera∣tions con∣cerning the sugar∣colonies.</NOTE> Over and above these new statutes, there were some other subjects which occasionally employed the attention of the commons; such as the state of the British sugar-colonies, which was considered in consequence of petitions presented by the sugar∣refiners and grocers of London, Westminster, and Bristol, complaining of the exorbitant price de∣manded and given for sugars imported from Ja∣maica; desiring, that the proprietors of land in Jamaica might be obliged to cultivate greater quan∣tities of ground for raising sugar canes, or that they (the petitioners) might have leave to import muscovado sugars from other countries, when the price of those imported from Jamaica should ex∣ceed a certain rate. This remonstrance was taken into consideration by a committee of the whole house; and a great number of evidences and papers being examined, they resolved, That the peo∣pling of Jamaica with white inhabitants, and culti∣vating the lands thereof, would be the most proper measure for securing that island, and increasing the trade and navigation between it and Great Britain,
<PB N="150" REF="1530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 175<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and other parts of his majesty's dominions: That the endeavours hitherto used by the legislature of Jamaica to increase the number of white inha∣bitants, and enforce the cultivation of lands, in the manner that might best conduce to the secu∣rity and defence of that island, had not been effec∣tual for these purposes. The house ordered a bill to be founded on these resolutions; but this was postponed, until the ministry should receive more full information touching the true state of that island.</P>
<P>The planters of Jamaica laboured under many grievances and hardships, from divers heavy impo∣sitions and restrictions; and a detail of these was transmitted in a representation to his majesty, which was referred to the consideration of the commis∣sioners of trade and plantations.</P>
<P>The cause of the planters was defended vigor∣ously, and managed in the house of commons by alderman Beckford, a gentleman of vast possessions in the island of Jamaica, who perfectly well under∣stood and strenuously supported the interest of that his native country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fate of the regis∣ter-bill.</NOTE> Abortive also proved the attempt to establish a law for keeping an annual register of marriages, births, deaths, the individuals who received alms, and the total number of people in Great Britain. A bill for this purpose was presented by Mr. Pot∣ter, a gentleman of pregnant parts and spirited elocution, who, enumerating the advantages of such a law, observed, that it would ascertain the number of the people, and the collective strength of the nation; consequently point out those places where there is a defect or excess of population,
<PB N="151" REF="1540"/>
and certainly determine whether a general naturali∣zation<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> would be advantageous or prejudicial to the community; that it would decide what number of men might, on any sudden emergency, be levied for the defence of the kingdom; and whether the nation is gainer or loser by sending its natives to settle, and our troops to defend distant colonies; that it would be the means of establishing a local administration of civil government, or a police upon certain fixed principles, the want of which hath been long a reproach to the nation, a security to vice, and an encouragement to idleness; that in many cases, where all other evidence is wanting, it would enable suitors to recover their right in courts of justice, facilitate an equal and equitable assess∣ment in raising the present taxes, and laying future impositions; specify the lineal descents, relations, and alliances of families; lighten the intolerable bur∣thens incurred, by the public, from innumerable and absurd regulations relating to the poor; pro∣vide for them by a more equal exertion of huma∣nity, and effectually screen them from all risque of perishing by hunger, cold, cruelty, and oppression. Whether such a law would have answered the san∣guine expectations of its patron, we shall not pre∣tend to determine; though, in our opinion, it must have been attended with very salutary conse∣quences, particularly in restraining the hand of robbery and violence, in detecting fraud, bridling the ferocity of a licentious people, and establishing a happy system of order and subordination. At first the bill met with little opposition, except from Mr. Thornton, member for the city of York, who inveighed against it with great fervour, as a mea∣sure
<PB N="152" REF="1550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> that savoured of French policy, to which the English nation ever had the utmost aversion. He affirmed, that the method in which it was proposed this register should be kept, would furnish the enemies of Great Britain with continual opportuni∣ties of knowing the strength or weakness of the nation; that it would impower an ill-designing minister to execute any scheme subversive of pub∣lic liberty, invest parish and petty officers of the peace with exorbitant powers, and cost the nation above fifty thousand pounds a year to carry the scheme into execution. These arguments, which, we apprehend, are extremely frivolous and incon∣clusive, had great weight with a considerable num∣ber, who joined in the opposition, while the mini∣stry stood neutral. Nevertheless, after having un∣dergone some amendments, it was conveyed to the lords, by whom it was, at the second reading, thrown out, as a scheme of a very dangerous ten∣dency. The legislature of Great Britain have, on some occasions, been more startled at the distant shadow of a bare possibility, than at the real ap∣proach of the most dangerous innovation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The par∣liament purchases the mu∣seum of Sir Hans Sloans.</NOTE> From the usual deliberations on civil and com∣mercial concerns, the attention of the parliament, which had seldom or never turned upon literary avocations, was called off by an extraordinary sub∣ject of this nature. Sir Hans Sloane, the cele∣brated physician and naturalist, well known through all the civilized countries of Europe for his ample collection of rarities, culled from the animal, ve∣getable, and mineral kingdoms, as well as of an∣tiquities and curiosities of act, had directed, in his last will, that this valuable museum, together with
<PB N="153" REF="1560"/>
his numerous library, should be offered to the par∣liament<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> for the use of the public, in consideration of their paying a certain sum, in compensation, to his heirs. His terms were embraced by the com∣mons, who agreed to pay twenty thousand pounds for the whole, supposed to be worth four times that sum; and a bill was prepared for purchasing this museum, together with the Harleian collection of manuscripts, so denominated from its founder, Ro∣bert Harley, earl of Oxford, lord high treasurer of England, and now offered to the public by his daughter the dutchess of Portland.</P>
<P>It was proposed, that these purchases should be joined to the famours Cottonian library, and a suit∣able repository provided for them and the king's library, which had long lain neglected, and exposed to the injuries of the weather in the old dormitory at Westminister. Accordingly trustees and gover∣nors, consisting of the most eminent persons of the kingdom, were appointed, and regulations esta∣blished for the management of this noble museum, which was deposited in Montague house, one of the most magnificent edifices in England, where it is subjected, without reserve, to the view of the public, under certain necessary restrictions, and ex∣hibits a glorious monument of national taste and liberality <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The library of Sir Hans Sloane consisted of above fif∣ty thousand volumes, includ∣ing about three hundred and fifty books of drawings, and three thousand five hun∣dred and sixteen manuscripts, besides a multitude of prints. The museum comprehended an infinite number of medals, coins, urns, utensils, seals, cameos, intaglios, precious stones, vessels of agate and jasper, chrystals, spars, fossils, metals, minerals, ores, earths, sands, salts, bitumens, sul∣phurs, amber, ambergrise, talcs, mirae, testaces, corals, spunges, echini, echenites, afteriae, trochi, crustatia, stellae marinae, fishes, birds▪ eggs, and nests, vipers, serpents, quadrupeds, insects, human calculi, anatomical prepara∣tions, seeds, gums, roots, dried plants, pictures, draw∣ings, and mathematical in∣struments.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> In the beginning of June the session of parlia∣ment was closed by his majesty, who mentioned nothing particular in his speech, but that the state of foreign affairs had suffered no alteration since their meeting.</P>
<P>The genius of the English people is perhaps in∣compatible with a state of perfect tranquillity: if it is not ruffled by foreign provocations, or agitated by unpopular measures of domestic administration, it will undergo temporary fermentations from the turbulent ingredients inherent in its own constitu∣tion. Tumults are excited, and factions kindled into rage and inveteracy, by incidents of the most frivolous nature. At this juncture the metropolis of England was divided and discomposed, in a sur∣prising manner, by a dispute in itself of so little consequence to the community, that it could not deserve a place in a general history, if it did not serve to convey a characteristic idea of the Eng∣lish<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able story of Eliza∣beth Canning.</NOTE> nation.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year an obscure damsel, of low degree, whose name was Elizabeth Can∣ning, promulgated a report, which, in a little time, attracted the attention of the public. She affirmed, that on the first day of the new year, at night, she was seized under Bedlam-wall by two ruffians, who, having stripped her of her upper-apparel, secured
<PB N="155" REF="1580"/>
her mouth with a gag, and threatened to murder<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> her should she make the least noise, conveyed her on foot about six miles to a place called Enfield∣wash, and brought her to the house of one Mrs. Wells, where she was pillaged of her stays; and, because she refused to turn prostitute, confined in a cold, damp, separate, and unfurnished apartment. Here she remained a whole month, without any other sustenance than a few stale crusts of bread, and about a gallon of water; till at length she forced her way through a window, and ran home to her mother's house, almost naked, in the night of the twenty-ninth of January.</P>
<P>This story, improbable and unsupported, ope∣rated so strongly on the passions of the people in the neighbourhood of Aldermanbury, where Can∣ning's mother lived, and particularly among fana∣tics of all denominations, that they raised volun∣tary contributions with surprising eagerness, in order to bring the supposed delinquents to justice. Warrants were granted for apprehending Wells, who kept the house at Enfield-wash, and her ac∣complices, the servant-maid, whose name was Vir∣tue Hall, and one Squires, an old gipsey-woman, who was charged by Canning with having robbed her of her stays. Wells, tho' acquitted of the felony, was punished as a bawd. Hall turned evidence for Canning, but afterwards recanted; and Squires, the gipsey, was convicted of the robbery, altho' she pro∣duced undoubted evidence to prove that she was at Abbotsbury in Dorsetshire that very night in which the felony was said to be committed; and Can∣ning and her friends fell into divers contradictions during the course of the trial▪ By this time the
<PB N="156" REF="1590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> prepossession of the common people in her favour had risen to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that the most palpable truths, which appeared on the other side, had no other effect than that of exasperating them to the most dangerous degree of rage and revenge. Some of the witnesses for Squires, tho' persons of unblemished character, were so intimi∣dated that they durst not enter the court; and those who had resolution enough to give evidence in her behalf, ran the risque of assassination from the vul∣gar that surrounded the place. On this occasion Sir Crispe Gascoyne, lord-mayor of London, be∣haved with that laudable courage and humanity which ought ever to distinguish the chief magi∣strate of such a metropolis. Considering the im∣probability of the charge, the heat, partiality, and blind enthusiasm with which it was prosecuted, and being convinced of the old woman's innocence by a great number of affidavits, voluntarily sent up from the country by persons of unquestionable cre∣dit, he, in conjunction with some other worthy citizens, resolved to oppose the torrent of vulgar prejudice. Application was made to the throne for mercy: the case was referred to the attorney and sollicitor-general, who, having examined the evidences on both sides, made their report in fa∣vour of Squires to the king and council; and this poor old creature was indulged with his majesty's pardon.</P>
<P>This affair was now swelled up into such a fac∣tion as divided the greater part of the kingdom, including the rich as well as the poor, the high as well as the humble. Pamphlets and pasquinades were published on both sides of the dispute, which
<PB N="157" REF="1600"/>
became the general topic of conversation in all as∣semblies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753</NOTE> and people of all ranks espoused one or other party with as much warmth and animosity as had ever inflamed the Whig and Tories, even, at the most rancorous period of their opposition. Sub∣scriptions were opened, and large sums levied, on one side to prosecute for perjury the persons on whose evidence the pardon had been granted. On the other hand, those who had interested them∣selves for the gipsey resolved to support her wit∣nesses, and, if possible, detect the imposture of Canning. Bills of perjury were preferred on both sides. The evidences for Squires were tried and acquitted: at first Canning absconded; but after∣wards surrendered, to take her trial; and being, after a long hearing, found guilty, was transported to the British colonies. The zeal of her friends, however, seemed to be inflamed by her conviction: and those who carried on the prosecution against her were insulted, even to the danger of their lives. They supplied her with necessaries of all sorts, payed for her transportation in a private ship, where she enjoyed all the comforts and conve∣niencies that could be afforded in that situation, and furnished her with such recommendations as secured to her a very agreeable reception in New England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Execu∣tion of Dr. Cameron▪</NOTE> Next to this very remarkable transaction, the incident that principally distinguished this year in England, was the execution of Dr. Archibald Ca∣meron, a native of North Britain, and brother to Cameron of Lochiel, chief of that numerous and warlike tribe, who had taken the field with the prince pretender; and after the battle of Culloden,
<PB REF="1610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> where he was dangerously wounded, found means to escape to the continent. His brother, the doc∣tor, had accompanied him in all his expeditions, tho' not in a military capacity, and was included with him in the act of attainder passed against those who had been concerned in the rebellion. Notwithstanding the imminent danger attending such an attempt, he returned privately to Scot∣land, in order (as it was reported) to recover a sum of money belonging to the pretender, which had been embezzled by his adherents in that country. Whatever may have been his inducement to revisit his native country under such a predicament, cer∣tain it is, he was discovered, apprehended, conduct∣ed to London, confined in the Tower, examined by the privy-council, and produced in the court of King's Bench; where his identity being proved by several witnesses, he received sentence of death, and was executed at Tyburn. The terror and resent∣ment of the people, occasioned by the rebellion, having by this time subsided, their humane passions did not fail to operate in favour of this unfortunate gentlemen: their pity was mingled with esteem, arising from his personal character, which was alto∣gether unblemished, and his deportment on this oc∣casion, which they could not help admiring as the standard of manly fortitude and decorum. The populace, tho' not very subject to tender emotions, were moved to compassion, and even to tears, by his behaviour at the place of execution. And many sincere well-wishers to the present establishment thought that the sacrifice of this victim at such a juncture could not redound either to its honour or security.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="1620"/>
The turbulent spirit, which is never totally ex∣tinguished<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> in this island, manifested itself in sundry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults in diffe∣rent parts of the kingdom.</NOTE> tumults that broke out in different parts of South Britain. The price of provision, and bread in par∣ticular, being raised to an exorbitant rate, in con∣sequence of an absurd exportation of corn, for the sake of the bounty, a formidable body of colliers and other labouring people raised an insurrection at Bristol, began to plunder the corn vessels in the harbour, and commit such outrages in the city, that the magistrates were obliged to have recourse to the military power. A troop of dragoons were sent to their assistance, and the insurgents were quelled, though not without some bloodshed. Commotions of the same kind were excited in Yorkshire, Manchester, and several other places in the northern counties: at Leeds, a detachment of the king's troops were obliged in their own defence to fire upon the rioters, eight or nine of whom were killed upon the spot; and indeed so little care had been taken to restrain the licentious insolence of the vulgar by proper laws and regulations, duly executed under the eye of civil magistracy, that a military power was found absolutely necessary to maintain the peace of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The tranquillity of the continent was not endan∣gered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturb∣ances in France, occasion∣ed by the bull Uni∣genitus.</NOTE> by any new contest or disturbance: yet the breach between the clergy and parliament of Paris was every day more and more widened, and the people were pretty equally divided between supersti∣tion and a regard for civil liberty. The parliament having caused divers ecclesiastics to be apprehended for having refused to administer the sacraments to persons in extremity, who refused to subscribe to
<PB N="160" REF="1630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> the bull unigenitus, all of them declared they acted according to the direction of the archbishop of Paris. Application being made to this haughty prelate, he treated the deputies of the parliament with the most supercilious contempt, and even seemed to brave the power and authority of that body. They, on the other hand, proceeded to take cognizance of the recusant clergy, until their sovereign ordered them to desist. Then they pre∣sented remonstrances to his majesty, reminding him of their privileges and the duty of their sta∣tion, which obliged them to do justice on all delin∣quents.</P>
<P>In the mean time they continued to perform their functions, and even commenced a prosecution against the bishop of Orleans, whom they sum∣moned to attend their tribunal. Next day they received from Versailles a lettre de cachet, accom∣panied by letters patent, commanding them to sus∣pend all prosecutions relating to the refusal of the sacraments; and ordering the letters patent to be registered. Instead of obeying these commands, they presented new remonstrances, for answers to which they were referred to the king's former declarations. In consequence of this intimation, they had spirit enough to resolve, "That whereas certain evil minded persons had prevented truth from reaching the throne, the chambers remained assembled, and all other business should be sus∣pended." The affair was now become very serious. His majesty, by fresh letters patent, renewed his orders, and commanded them to proceed with their ordinary business, on pain of incurring his displea∣sure. They forthwith came to another resolution,
<PB N="161" REF="1640"/>
importing, that they could not obey this injunction<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> without a breach of their duty and their oath. Next day letters de cachet were issued, banishing to different parts of the kingdom all the members except those of the great chamber, which the court did not find more tractable than their brethren. They forthwith resolved to abide by the two reso∣lutions mentioned above; and, as an instance of their unshaken fortitude, ordered an ecclesiastic to be taken into custody for refusing the sacraments. This spirited measure involved them in the fate of the rest; for they were also exiled from Paris, the citizens of which did not fail to extol their con∣duct with the loudest encomiums, and at the same time to express their resentment against the clergy, who could not stir abroad without being exposed to violence or insult. The example of the parlia∣ment of Paris was followed by that of Rouen, which had courage enough to issue orders for ap∣prehending the bishop of Evreux, because he had refused to appear when summoned to their tribu∣nal. Their decrees on this occasion being an∣nulled by the king's council of state, they presented a bold remonstrance; which, however, had no other effect than that of exasperating the ministry. A grand deputation being ordered to attend the king, they were commanded to desist from intermeddling in disputes relating to the refusal of the sacraments, and to register this injunction. At their return they had recourse to a new remonstrance; and one of their principal counsellors, who had spoken freely in the debates on this subject, was arrested by a party of dragoons, who carried him prisoner to the castle of Dourlens.

Apprehensive, however, that these disputes would put an entire stop to the administration of justice, he, by letters patent, established a royal chamber for the prose∣cution of suits civil and criminal, which was opened with a solemn mass performed in the queen's chapel at the Louvre, where all the mem∣bers assisted. On this occasion another difficulty occurred. The letters patent constituting this new court ought to have been registered by the par∣liament, which was now no more. To remedy this defect, application was made to the inferior court of the Chatelet; which refusing to register them, one of its members was committed to the Bastile, and another absconded. Intimidated by this ex∣ertion of despotic power, they allowed the king's officers to enter the letters in their register; but afterwards adopted more vigorous resolutions. The lieutenant civil appearing in their court, all the counsellors rose up and retired, leaving him alone, and on the table an arret, importing, That whereas the confinement of one of their members, the persecution of another, who durst not appear, and the present calamities of the nation, gave them just apprehension for their own persons, they had, after mature deliberation, thought proper to re∣tire.

The interests of his Britannic majesty being powerfully supported by the house of Austria, the minister of that power at the diet proposed that the affair should be taken into immediate consideration. He was seconded by the minister of Brunswic; but the envoy from Bran∣denburg having protested in form against this pro∣cedure, withdrew from the assembly, and the Bruns∣wic minister made a counter-protestation, after which he also retired. Then a motion being made that this dispute should be referred to the decision of the Aulic council at Vienna, it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of fourteen voices. His Prussian majesty's final declaration, with regard to this affair, was afterwards presented to the diet, and answered in the sequel by a memorial from his Britannic majesty as elector of Hanover. Some other petty disputes likewise happened between the regency of Hanover and the city of Munster; and the former claiming some bailiwicks in the territo∣ries of Bremen, sequestered certain revenues be∣longing to this city, in Stade and Ferden, until<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraor∣dinary treaty be∣tween the court of Vienna and the duke of Modena▪</NOTE> these claims should be satisfied.</P>

of chicanery and cavil with such perseverance, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753▪</NOTE> the negotiation proved abortive, the conferences broke up, and every thing seemed to portend ap∣proaching hostilities. But before we proceed to a detail of the incidents which were the immediate forerunners of the war, we will endeavour to con∣vey a just idea of the dispute concerning Nova-Scotia; which, we apprehend, is but imperfectly understood, though of the utmost importance to the interest of Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descrip∣tion of Nova Scotia.</NOTE> Nova Scotia, called by the French Acadie, lies between the forty-fourth and fiftieth degrees of north latitude, having New England and the At∣lantic ocean to the south and fourth-west, and the river and gulph of St. Laurence to the north and north-east. The winter, which continues near seven months in this country, is intensely cold; and▪ without the intervention of any thing that can be called spring, it is immediately succeeded by a summer, the heat of which is almost insup∣portable, but of no long continuance. The soil in general is thin and barren, tho' some parts of it are said to be equal to the best land in England. The whole country is covered with a perpetual fog, even after the summer has commenced. It was first possessed by the French, before they made any establishment in Canada; and they, by dint of industry and indefatigable perseverance, in strug∣gling with the many difficulties they necessarily laboured under in the infancy of this settlement, subsisted tolerably well, and increased considerably, with very little assistance from Europe; whilst we, even now, should lose the immense expence we have already been at to settle a colony there, and
<PB N="166" REF="1690"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> should see all our endeavours to that end defeated, if the support of the royal hand was withdrawn but for a moment.</P>
<P>This country, by the possession of which an enemy would be enabled greatly to annoy all our other colonies, and, if in the hands of the French, would be of singular service both to their fishery and their sugar-islands, has frequently changed hands from the French to the English, and from the English back again to the French; until our right to it was finally settled by the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, by which all the country included within the antient limits of what was called Nova Scotia, or Acadia, was ceded to the English. This article was confirmed by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; but for want of ascertaining distinctly what were the bounds intended to be fixed by the two nations, with respect to this pro∣vince, disputes arose, and commissaries, as we have observed, were appointed by both sides to adjust the litigation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Short view of the dis∣pute con∣cerning the limits of Nova Scotia.</NOTE> The commissaries of the king of Great Britain conformed themselves to the rule laid down by the treaty itself, and assigned those as the ancient limits of this country which had always passed as such, from the very earliest times of any certainty down to the conclusion of the treaty; which the two crowns had frequently declared to be such, and which the French had often admitted and allowed. These limits are, the southern bank of the river St. Laurence to the north, and Pentagoet to the west: the country situated between these boundaries, is that which the French received by the treaty of St. Germain's, in the year one thousand six hundred
<PB N="167" REF="1700"/>
and thirty-two, under the general name of Acadia.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> Of this country, thus limited, they continued in possession from that period to the year one thou∣sand six hundred and fifty-four, when a descent was made upon it under the command of colonel Sedgwick. That these were then the undisputed limits of Acadia, his Britannic majesty's commis∣saries plainly proved, by a letter of Lewis XIII. to the sieurs Charnisay and La Tour, regulating their jurisdictions in Acadia; by the subsequent commissions of the French king to the same per∣sons, as governors of Acadia, in the sequel; and by that which was afterwards granted to the sieur Denys, in the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-four; all of which extend the bounds of this country from the river St. Laurence to Pentagoet and New England. That these were the notions of the French, with respect to the ancient limits of this province, was farther confirmed by the de∣mand made by their ambassador, in the course of that same year, for the restitution of the forts Pen∣tagoet, St. John's, and Port-royal, as forts situ∣ated in Acadia.</P>
<P>In the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-two, upon the revival of the claim of France to the country of Acadia, which had been left undecided by the treaty of Westminster, the French ambas∣sador, then at the court of London, assigned Pen∣tagoet as the western, and the river St. Laurence as the northern boundary of that country; and al∣ledged the restitution of Acadia in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-two, and the pos∣session taken by France in consequence thereof, as well as the continuation of that possession, with the
<PB N="168" REF="1710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> same limits, to the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-four, as proofs of the equity and validity of the claim he then made: in which claim, and in the manner of supporting it, he was particularly approved of by the court of France. The same court afterwards thought it so clear, upon former determinations and her own former possessions, that the true antient boundaries of Acadia were Pentagoet to the west, and the river St. Laurence to the north, that she desired no specification of limits in the treaty of Breda, but was contented with the restitution of Acadia, generally named: and, upon a dispute, which arose in the execution of this treaty, France reasserted, and Great Britain, after some discussion, agreed to the abovemen∣tioned limits of Acadia; and France obtained pos∣session of that country, so bounded, under the treaty of Breda.</P>
<P>The sease of France upon this subject, in the years one thousand six hundred and eighty-five, and one thousand six hundred and eighty▪seven, was also clearly manifested, in the memorials delivered at that time by the French ambassador at the court of London, complaining of some encroachments made by the English upon the coast of Acadia: he described the country as extending from isle Per∣cee, which lies at the entrance of the river of St. Laurence, to St. George's island: and again, in a subsequent complaint, made by Mons. Barillon and Mons. de Bonrepaus, to the court of Great Britain, against the judge of Pemaquid, for having seized the effects of a French merchant at Penta∣goet, which, said they, was situated in Acadia, as restored to France by the treaty of Breda.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="1720"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> To explain the sense of France, touching the bounds of Acadia in the year one thousand seven hundred, the British commissaries produced a pro∣posal of the French ambassador, then residing in Great Britain, to restrain the limits of that country to the river St. George. They also instanced the surrender of Port-Royal in the year one thousand seven hundred and ten, in which Acadia is de∣scribed with the same limits with which France had received it in the years one thousand six hundred and thirty-two, and one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven. And further, to ascertain the sense of both crowns, even at the treaty of Utrecht it∣self, they produced the queen of Great Britain's instructions to her ambassadors, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eleven, in which they were directed to insist, "That his most Christian majesty should quit all claim or title, by virtue of any former treaty, or otherwise, to the country called Nova Scotia, and expresly to Port-Royal, otherwise Annapolis Royal." To these they added a manifest demonstration, founded on indisputable facts, proving, that the recital of the several sorts of right which France have ever pretended to this country, and a specification of both terms, Aca∣dia, or Nova Scotia, were intended by Great Bri∣tain to obviate all doubts which had ever been made concerning the limits of Acadia, and to com∣prehend, with more certainty, all that country which France had ever received as such: finally, to specify what France considered as Acadia, dur∣ing the treaty, they referred to the offers of that crown in the year one thousand seven ▪hundred and twelve, in which she proposed to restrain the
<PB N="170" REF="1730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> boundary of Acadia to the river St. George, as a departure from its real boundary, in case Great Britain would restore to her the possession of that country.</P>
<P>From all these facts it plainly appears, that Great Britain demanded nothing but what the fair con∣struction of the words of the treaty of Utrecht ne∣cessarily implies; and that it is impossible for any thing to have more evident marks of candour and fairness in it, than the demand of the English on this occasion. From the variety of evidence brought in support of this claim, it evidently re∣sults, that the English commissaries assigned no limits as the ancient limits of Acadia, but those which France herself determined to be such in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty two; and which she possessed, in consequence of that deter∣mination, till the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-four: that in one thousand six hundred and sixty-two France claimed, and received in one thousand six hundred and sixty-nine, the country which Great Britain now claims as Acadia, restored to France by the treaty of Breda under that general denomination: that France never considered Aca∣dia as having any other limits than those which were assigned to it from the year one thousand six hundred and thirty-two, to the year one thousand seven hundred and ten; and that, by the treaty of Utrecht, she engaged to transfer that very same country, as Acadia, which France has always as∣serted and possessed, and Great Britain now claims, as such.</P>
<P>Should the crown of France, therefore, be ever willing to decide what are the antient limits of Aca∣dia,
<PB N="171" REF="1740"/>
by her own declarations so frequently made in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> like discussions upon the same point, by her posses∣sions of this country for almost a century, and by her description of Acadia, during the negociation of that very treaty upon which this doubt is raised, she cannot but admit the claim of Great-Britain to be conformable to the treaty of Utrecht, and to the description of the country transferred to Great Britain by the twelfth article of that treaty. There is a consistency in the claim of the English, and a compleatness in the evidence brought in support of it, which is seldom seen in discussions of this sort; for it rarely happens, in disputes of such a nature between two crowns, that either of them can safe∣ly offer to have its pretensions decided by the known and repeated declarations, or the possessions of the other.</P>
<P>To answer the force of this detail of conclusive historical facts, and give a new turn to the real question in dispute, the French commissaries, in their memorial laid it down, as a distinction made by the treaty of Utrecht, that the antient limits of Acadia, referred to by that treaty, are different from any with which that country may have passed under the treaties of St. Germain's and Breda; and then endeavoured to shew, upon the testimonies of maps and historians, that Acadia and its limits were antiently confined to the south-eastern part of the peninsula. In support of this system, the French commissaries had recourse to antient maps and historians, who, as they asserted, had ever con∣fined Acadia to the limits they assigned. They al∣ledged, that those commissions of the French go∣vernment over Acadia, which the English cited as
<PB N="172" REF="1750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> evidences of the limits they claimed, were given as commssioners over Acadia and the country around it, and not over Acadia only: that the whole of the country claimed by the English, as Acadia, could not possibly be supposed ever to have been considered as such, because many parts of that ter∣ritory always did, and still do, preserve particular and distinct names. They affirmed New France to be a province in itself; and argued, that many parts of what we claim as Acadia, can never have been in Acadia, because historians and the French commissions of government expresly place them in New France. They asserted, that no evidence can be drawn of the opinion of any crown, with respect to the limits of any country, from its declaration during the negotiation of a treaty; and, in the end, relying on maps and historians for their an∣tient limits of Acadia, they pretended that the ex∣press restitution of St. Germain's, and the posses∣sion taken by France in consequence of the treaty of Breda, after a long discussion of the limits, and the declaration of France during the negociation of the treaty of Utrecht, were foreign to the point in question.</P>
<P>In refutation of these maxims, the English com∣missaries proved, from an examination of the maps and historians cited by the French in support of their system, that if this question was to be decided upon the authorities which they themselves allowed to belong, and to be applicable, to this discussion, the limits which they assigned were utterly incon∣sistent with the best maps of all countries, which are authorities in point for almost every part of the claim of Great Britain. They shewed, that the
<PB N="173" REF="1760"/>
French historians Champlain and Denys, and par∣ticularly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> this last, with his commission in the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-five, assigned the same northern and western limits to Acadia which they did; and that Escarbot, another of their historians, as far as any evidence can be drawn from his writings, agrees intirely with the former two. They observed▪ that all these evidences fall in with and confirm the better authorities of trea∣ties, and the several transactions between the two crowns for near a century past; and that the French commissaries, by deviating from treaties, and the late proceedings of the two crowns, to ancient historians and maps, only made a transition from an authentic to an insufficient sort of evidence; and led the English commissaries into an inquiry, which proved, that both the proper and the im∣proper, the regular and the foreign evidence, upon which this matter had been rested, equally con∣futed the limits alledged by the French commissa∣ries as the antient limits of Acadia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambiti∣ous schemes of the French in North America.</NOTE> While the British ministry depended upon the success of the conferences between the commissa∣ries of the two crowns at Paris, the French were actually employed in executing their plans of en∣croachment upon the British colonies in North America. Their scheme was to engross the whole-fur-trade of that continent; and they had already made great progress in extending a chain of forts, connecting their settlements on the river Mississippi with their possessions in Canada, along the great lakes of Erie and Ontario, which last issues in the river St. Laurence. By these means they hoped to exclude the English from all communication
<PB N="174" REF="1770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> and traffic with the Indian nations, even those that lay contiguous to the British settlements, and con∣fine them within a line of their drawing, beyond which they should neither extend their trade nor plantations. Their commercial spirit did not keep pace with the gigantic strides of their ambition: they could not supply all those Indians with the ne∣cessaries they wanted, so that many of the natives had recourse to the English settlements; and this commerce produced a connection, in consequence of which the British adventurers ventured to travel with merchandize as far as the banks of the river Ohio, that runs into the Mississippi, a great way the other fide of the Apalachean mountains, be∣yond which none of our colonists had attempted to penetrate.</P>
<P>The tract of country lying along the Ohio is so fertile, pleasant, and inviting, and the Indians, called Twightees, who inhabit those delightful plains, were so well disposed towards a close alli∣ance with the English, that as far back as the year one thousand seven handred and sixteen, Mr. Spotswood, governor of Virginia, proposed a plan for erecting a company to settle such lands upon this river as should be ceded to them by treaty with the natives; but the design was at that time frustrated, partly by the indolence and timidity of the British ministry, who were afraid of giving umbrage to the French, and partly by the jealou∣sies and divisions subsisting between the different colonies of Great Britain. The very same circum∣stances encouraged the French to proceed in their project of invasion. At length, they penetrated from the banks of the river St. Laurence, across
<PB N="175" REF="1780"/>
the lake Champlain, and upon the territory of New<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> York, built with impunity, and, indeed, without opposition, the fort of Crown-Point, the most in∣solent and dangerous encroachment that they had hitherto carried into execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise and conduct of the Ohio company.</NOTE> Governor Spotswood's scheme for an Ohio com∣pany was revived immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, when certain merchants of Lon∣don, who traded to Maryland and Virginia, peti∣tioned the government of this subject, and were indulged not only with a grant of a great tract of ground to the southward of Pensylvania, which they promised to settle; but also with an exclusive privilege of trading with the Indians on the banks of the river Ohio. This design no sooner trans∣pired, than the French governor of Canada took the alarm, and wrote letters to the governors of New York and Pensylvania, giving them to un∣derstand, that as the English inland traders had encroached on the French territories and privi∣leges by trading with the Indians under the pro∣tection of his sovereign, he would seize them wherever they could be found, if they did not im∣mediately desist from that illicit practice. No re∣gard being paid to this intimation, he next year caused three British traders to be arrested. Their effects were confiscated, and they themselves con∣veyed to Quebec, from whence they were sent prisoners to Rochelle in France, and there detained in confinement. In this situation they presented a remonstrance to the earl of Albemarle, at that time English ambassador in Paris, and he reclaim∣ing them as British subjects, they were set at liberty. Although, in answer to his lordship's me∣morial,
<PB N="176" REF="1790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> the court of Versailles promised to transmit orders to the French governors in America to use all their endeavours for preventing any disputes that might have a tendency to alter the good cor∣respondence established between the two nations; in all probability, the directions given were the very reverse of these professions: for the French commanders, partisans, and agents in America, took every step their busy genius could suggest, to strengthen their own power, and weaken the in∣fluence of the English, by embroiling them with the Indian nations. This task they found the more easy, as the natives had taken offence against the English, when they understood that their lands were given away without their knowledge, and that there was a design to build forts in their coun∣try, without their consent and concurrence. In∣deed the person whom the new company employed to survey the banks of the Ohio, concealed his de∣sign so carefully, and behaved in other respects in such a dark mysterious manner, as could not fail to arouse the jealousy of a people naturally inquisi∣tive, and very much addicted to suspicion. How the company proposed to settle this acquisition in despite of the native possessors, it is not easy to conceive: and still more unaccountable that they should have neglected the natives, whose consent and assistance they might have procured at a very small expence. Instead of acting such a fair, open, and honourable part, they sent one Mr. Gist to make a clandestine survey of the country, as far as the falls of the river Ohio, and, as we have observed above, his conduct alarmed both the French and Indians. The erection of this com∣pany
<PB N="177" REF="1800"/>
was equally disagreeable to the separate tra∣ders<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> of Virginia and Pensylvania, who saw them∣selves on the eve of being deprived of a valuable branch of traffic, by the exclusive charter of a mo∣nopoly; and therefore employed their emissaries to foment the jealousy of the Indians.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter from the governor of Virgi∣nia to the French comman∣der at fort Sur la Ri∣viere au Beuf.</NOTE> The French having in a manner commenced hostilities against the English, and actually built forts on the territories of the British allies at Nia∣gara, and on the lake Erie, Mr. Hamilton, go∣vernor of Pensylvania, communicated this intelli∣gence to the assembly of the province, and repre∣sented the necessity of erecting truck-houses, or places of strength and security, on the river Ohio, to which the traders might retire in case of insult or molestation. The proposal was approved, and money granted for the purpose; but the assembly could not agree about the manner in which they should be erected; and in the mean time the French fortified themselves at leisure, and conti∣nued to harrass the traders belonging to the British settlements. Repeated complaints of these en∣croachments and depredations being represented to Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, he, to∣wards the latter end of this very year, sent major Washington with a letter to the commanding officer of a fort which the French had built on the Riviere au Beuf, which falls into the Ohio, not far from the lake Erie.

He desired to know by whose authority and in∣structions his Britannic majesty's territories had been invaded; and required him to depart in peace without further prosecuting a plan, which must in∣terrupt the harmony and good understanding which his majesty was desirous to continue and cultivate with the most Christian king. To this spirited in∣timation the officer replied, That it was not his province to specify the evidence, and demonstrate the right of the king his master to the lands situated on the river Ohio; but he would transmit the let∣ter to the marquis du Quesne, and act according to the answer he should receive from that noble∣man. In the mean time, he said he did not think himself obliged to obey the summons of the Eng∣lish governor; that he commanded the fort by vir∣tue of an order from his general, to which he was determined to conform with all the precision and resolution of a good officer. Mr. Dinwiddie ex∣pected no other reply, and therefore had pro∣jected a fort to be erected near the forks of the river. The province undertook to defray the ex∣pence, and the stores for that purpose were already provided; but, by some fatal oversight, the con∣currence of the Indians was neither obtained nor solicited, and therefore they looked upon this mea∣sure with an evil eye, as a manifest invasion of their property.</P>
<P>While the French thus industriously extended their encroachments to the southward, they were not idle in the gulph of St. Laurence; but seized
<PB N="179" REF="1840"/>
every opportunity of distressing the English settle∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> of Nova-Scotia. We have already observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perfi∣dious practices of the French in Nova Scotia.</NOTE> that the town of Halifax was no sooner built, than they spirited up the Indians of that neighbourhood to commit hostilities against the inhabitants, some of whom they murdered, and others they carried prisoners to Louisbourg, where they sold them for arms and ammunition; the French pretending that they maintained this traffic from motives of pure compassion, in order to prevent the massacre of the English captives, whom, however, they did not set at liberty, without exacting an exorbitant ran∣som. As these sculking parties of Indians were generally directed and headed by French com∣manders, repeated complaints were made to the governor of Louisbourg, who still answered that his jurisdiction did not extend over the Indians, and that their French conductors were chosen from the inhabitants of Annapolis, who thought proper to remain in that country after it was ceded to the English, and were in fact the subjects of Great Britain. Even while the conferences were carried on for ascertaining the limits of Nova Scotia, the governor of Canada detached M. La Corne with some regular troops and a body of militia to for∣tify a post on the bay of Chignecto, on pretence that this and a great part of the peninsula belonged to his government. The possession of this post not only secured to the Indians of the continent a free entrance into the peniusula, and a safe retreat in case of pursuit; but also encouraged the French inhabitants of Annapolis to rise in open rebellion against the English government.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> In the spring of the year one thousand seven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Major Laurence defeats the French neutrals.</NOTE> hundred and fifty, general Cornwallis, governor of Halifax, detached major Laurence with a few men to reduce them to obedience. At his ap∣proach they burned their town to ashes, forsook their possessions, and threw themselves under the protection of M. La Corne, who, thus reinforced, found himself at the head of fifteen hundred men, well provided with arms and ammunition. Major Lawrence, being unable to cope with him in the field, demanded an interview, at which he desired to know for what cause the French inhabitants of Nova Scotia had shaken off their allegiance to the crown of Great Britain, and violated the neutrality which they had hitherto affected to profess. The French officer, without pretending to account for their behaviour, gave him to understand in general terms, that he had orders to defend his post, and these orders he was determined to obey. The Eng∣lish major, finding himself too weak to attack their united force, and having no orders to commit hos∣tilities against any but the Indians and their open abettors, returned to Halifax without having been able to fulfil the purpose of his expedition. Im∣mediately after his retreat, the French neutrals (so they were called) returned to the habitations which they had abandoned; and, in conjunction with the Indians, renewed their depredations upon the in∣habitants of Halifax and its dependent settlements. The English governor, justly incensed at these outrages, and seeing they would neither submit to the English government themselves, nor allow others to enjoy it with tranquillity, resolved to ex∣pel them effectually from the country they so ill de∣served

to possess. Major Laurence was again de∣tached<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> with a thousand men, transported by sea, to Chignecto, where he found the French and Indians intrenched, in order to dispute his landing. Not∣withstanding this opposition, he made a descent with a few companies, received and returned a smart fire, and, rushing into their entrenchments, obliged them to fly with the utmost precipitation, leaving a con∣siderable number kiiled and wounded on the spot. The fugitives saved themselves by crossing a river, on the further bank of which La Corne stood at the head of his troops, drawn up in order to re∣ceive them as friends and dependants. He had by this time erected a fort, which he denominated Beau Sejour; and now the English built another on the opposite side of the river, which was called after its founder St. Laurence. This being provided with a good garrison, served as a check upon the French, and in some measure restrained the incursions of their barbarians. Not that it effectually answered this purpose; for the Indians and neutrals still<NOTE PLACE="marg">The little town of Dart∣mouth burned by the Indians.</NOTE> seized every opportunity of attacking the English in the interior part of the peninsula. In the course of the succeeding year they surprized the little town of Dartmouth on the other side of Halifax-bay, where they killed and scalped a good number of people, and carried off some prisoners.</P>
<P>For these expeditions the French always supplied them with boats, canoes, arms, and ammunition; and indeed they were conducted with such care and secrecy, that it was almost impossible to prevent their success. One sure remedy against the sudden and stolen incursions of those savages might have been found in the use of staunch hounds, which

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> would have run upon the foot, detected the sculk∣ing parties of the Indians, and frustrated all their ambuscades: but this expedient, so easy and prac∣ticable, was never tried, though frequently recom∣mended in public to the attention of the govern∣ment, and the consideration of the colonists. The Indians continued to plunder and massacre the Bri∣tish subjects with impunity, and were countenanced by the French government in that country, who now strengthened their lodgment on the neck of the peninsula with an additional sort, distinguished by the name of Baye-verte; and built a third at the mouth of St. John's river, on the north-side of the bay of Fundy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bri∣tish am∣bassador at Paris amused with ge∣neral promises.</NOTE> All these previous steps to a rupture with Eng∣land were taken with great deliberation, while the commissaries of both nations were disputing about the limits of the very country which they thus ar∣rogantly usurped; and they proceeded to perfect their chain of forts to the southward, without pay∣ing the least regard to the expostulations of the English governors, or to a memorial presented at Versailles by the earl of Albemarle, the British mi∣nister. He demanded, that express orders should be sent to M De la Jonquiere, the commander for the French in America, to desist from violence against the British subjects in that country: that the fort of Niagara should be immediately razed: that the subjects of Great Britain, who had been made prisoners, should be set at liberty, and in∣demnified for the losses they had sustained: and that the persons who had committed these excesses, should be punished in an exemplary manner. True it is, six Englishmen, whom they had un∣justly

taken, were immediately dismissed; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> ambassador was amused with general promises of sending such instructions to the French governor in America, as should anticipate any cause of com∣plaint for the future: but, far from having any in∣tention to perform these promises, the court of Ver∣sailles, without all doubt, exhorted La Jonquiere to proceed, in bringing its ambitious schemes to perfection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Session of parlia∣ment opened.</NOTE> Every incident in America seemed to prognosti∣cate war, when the session of parliament was opened on the fifteenth day of November: yet his majesty, on this occasiok, told them, That the events of the year had not made it necessary for him to offer any thing in particular to their consideration, relating to foreign affairs. He even declared, That the continuance of the public tranquillity, and the general state of Europe, remained upon the same footing as when they last parted; and assured them of his steadiness in pursuing the most effectual measures to preserve to his people the blessings of peace. He expressed uncommon concern that the horrid crimes of robbery and murder were of late rather increased than diminished, and earnestly re∣commended this important object to their serious attention.</P>
<P>Affectionate addresses were presented by both houses in answer to this harangue; and, what was very remarkable, they were proposed and passed without question or debate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted.</NOTE> The commons continued the same number of seamen and land-forces for the ensuing year which had been granted in the last session, and made suit∣able provision for all the exigencies of the state.
<PB N="184" REF="1900"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> The whole supply amounted to two millions seven hundred ninety-seven thousand nine hundred and sixteen pounds ten shillings and two-pence, to be raised by a land-tax of two shillings in the pound, malt-tax, a continuation of certain duties on wine, vinegar, cyder, and beer imported, a sum taken from the sinking-fund, and the overplus of certain grants, funds, and duties. The provisions made considerably exceeded the grants; but this excess was chargeable with the interest of what should be borrowed upon the credit of the land or malt-tax, there being a clause of credit in both, as also with the deficiency (if any should happen) in the sums they were computed to produce. The house agreed to all these resolutions almost unanimously: indeed, no opposition was made to any of them, but that for continuing the same number of land∣forces, which was carried by a great majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Repeal of the act for natura∣lizing Jews.</NOTE> The act permitting Jews to be naturalized, which had, during the last session, triumphed over such an obstinate opposition, was by this time be∣come the object of national horror and execration. Every part of the kingdom resounded with the reproach of the ministry who had enforced such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> measure; and the two brothers, who en∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the greater part of the administration, trembled at the prospect of what this clamour might produce at the general election, this being the last session of the present parliament. So eager were the ministers to annul this unpopular mea∣sure, that, immediately after the peers had agreed to the nature and form of an address to his ma∣jest, the d—of N—, with that precipitation so peculiar to his character, poured forth an ab∣rupt
<PB N="185" REF="1910"/>
harangue, in that house, importing, that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> dissaffected had made an handle of the act passed last session, in favour of the Jews, to raise discon∣tents among many of his majesty's good subjects; and as the act was in itself of little importance, he was of opinion it ought to be repealed: for this purpose he presented a bill ready framed which was read and committed, though not without some debate.</P>
<P>The naturalization-bill, now devoted as a sacri∣fice to the resentment of the people, contained a clause disabling all naturalized Jews from pur∣chasing, inheriting, or receiving any advowson or presentation, or right to any ecclesiastical benefice or promotion, school, hospital, or donative; and by the first draught of the bill, which his grace now presented, it was intended that this clause should not be repealed. It was the opinion, how∣ever, of the majority, that such a clause standing unrepealed might imply, that the Jews, by being thus expresly excluded from the possession of any ecclesiastical right of presentation, would be consi∣dered as having the power and privilege of pur∣chasing and inheriting any lay-property in the kingdom. On this consideration an amendment was made in the bill, the clause in question was left out, and the whole act of naturalization repealed without exception <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The reverend bench of bishops had, with a laudable spirit of christian meekness and philanthropy, generally approved of the indulgence granted to their Hebrew brethren; and now they ac∣quiesced in the proposed re∣peal with the same passive dis∣cretion, though one of the number contended for the saving clause, which the duke of N—had recommended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="1920"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> Though the lords, in general, concurred in the expediency of the repeal, it was opposed by some few, as too great a sacrifice to the idle and un∣founded clamours of the multitude; and upon this side of the debate a great power of elocution was displayed by earl Temple, who had lately suc∣ceeded to this title on the death of his mother, a nobleman of distinguished abilities, and the most amiable disposition, frank, liberal, humane, and zealously attached to the interest and honour of his country.</P>
<P>In the lower house the members of both parties seemed to vie with each other in demonstrations of aversion to this unpopular act. On the very first day of the session, immediately after the motion for an address to his majesty, Sir James Dashwood, an eminent leader in the opposition, gave the com∣mons to understand, that he had a motion of very great importance to make, which would require the attention of every member, as soon as the mo∣tion for the address should be discussed: he there∣fore desired they would not quit the house, until he should have an opportunity to explain his pro∣posal. Accordingly they had no sooner agreed to the motion for an address of thanks to his majesty, than he stood up again; and having expatiated upon the just and general indignation which the act of the preceding session, in favour of the Jews, had raised among the people, he moved to order, that the house should be called over on Tuesday the fourth day of December, for taking that act into consideration: but being given to understand, that it was not usual to appoint a call of the house for any particular purpose, he agreed that the mo∣tion
<PB N="187" REF="1930"/>
should be general. It was seconded by lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> Parker, his opposite in political interests: the house agreed to it without opposition, and the call was ordered accordingly. They were anticipated how∣ever by the lords, who framed and transmitted to them a bill on the same subject. To the purport of it the commons made no objection; for every member, having the fear of the general election before his eyes, carefully avoided every expression which could give umbrage to his constituents: but violent opposition was made to the preamble, which ran in the following strain: "Whereas an act of parliament was made and passed in the twenty-fifth year of his majesty's reign, intituled, An act to permit persons professing the Jewish religion to be naturalized by parliament, and for other pur∣poses therein mentioned; and whereas occasion has been taken, from the said act, to raise discontents and disquiets in the minds of his majesty's subjects, be it enacted, &amp;c." This introduction was consi∣dered as an unjust reflection upon the body of the people in general, and in particular upon those who had opposed the bill in the course of the pre∣ceding session. Sir Roger Newdigate therefore moved, that the expression should be varied to this effect: "Whereas great discontents and disquie∣tudes had from the sad act arisen." The conse∣quence of this motion was an obstinate debate, in which it was supported by the earl of Eg—t, and divers other able orators; but Mr. Pelham and Mr. P—were numbered among its oponents. The question being put for the proposed alteration, it was of course carried in the negative: the bill, after the third reading, passed nemine contradi∣cente,
<PB N="188" REF="1940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> and in due time obtained the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion for re∣pealing a former act fa∣vourable to the Jews.</NOTE> Even this concession of the ministry did not al∣lay the resentment of the people, and their appre∣hensions of encroachment from the Jews. Another act still subsisted, by virtue of which any person professing the Jewish religion might become a free denizon of Great Britain, after having resided se∣ven years in any of his majesty's colonies in Ame∣rica; and this was now considered as a law having the same dangerous tendency, of which the other was now in a fair way of being convicted. It was moved therefore in the lower house, that part of this former act might be read: then the same member made a motion for an address to his ma∣jesty, desiring, that the house might have the pe∣rusal of the lists transmitted from the American co∣lonies to the commissioners for trade and planta∣tions, containing the names of all such persons pro∣fessing the Jewish religion as had intitled them∣selves to the benefit of the said act since the year one thousand seven hundred and forty.</P>
<P>These lists were accordingly presented, and left upon the table for the perusal of the members: but as this act contained no limitation of time within which the benefit of it should be claimed, and as this claim was attended with a good deal of trouble and some expence, very few persons had availed themselves of it in that period. Neverthe∣less, as a great number of Jews were already intit∣led to claim this indulgence, and as it remained an open channel through which Great Britain might be deluged with those people, all of whom the law would hold as natural▪born subjects, and
<PB N="189" REF="1950"/>
their progeny as freed from all the restrictions con∣tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754▪</NOTE> in the act, with respect to naturalized fo∣reigners, lord Harley moved for leave to bring in a bill, to repeal so much of the said act as related to persons professing the Jewish religion, who should come to settle in any British colony after a certain time. The motion was seconded by Sir James Dashwood, and supported by the earl of Egmont; but being found unequal to the interest and elocu∣tion of Mr. Pelham and Mr. P—, was rejected by the majority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny bill for the ser∣vice of the East India company.</NOTE> The next object that claimed the attention of the commons, was a bill for improving the regula∣tions already made to prevent the spreading of a contagious distemper, which raged among the horned cattle in different parts of the kingdom. The last bill of this session, that had the good for∣tune to succeed, was brought in for punishing mu∣tiny and desertion of officers and soldiers in the service of the East India company, and for the punishment of offences committed in the East In∣dies and the island of St. Helena. This being a measure of a very extraordinary nature, all the members were ordered to attend the house on the day fixed for the second reading: at the same time all charters, commissions, and authorities, by which any powers relative to a military jurisdiction, or the exercise of martial law, had been granted or de∣rived from the crown to the said company, were submitted to the perusal of the members. The bill was by many considered as a dangerous extension of military power, to the prejudice of the civil rights enjoyed by British subjects, and as such violently contested by the earl of Egmont, lord Strange, and

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> Mr. Alderman Beckford. Their objections were answered by the solicitor-general and Mr. Yorke. The b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, after some warm debates, being espoused by the ministry, was enacted into a law, and dis∣patched to the East Indies by the first opportu∣nity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of L—e.</NOTE> Some other motions were made, and petitions presented on different subjects, which, as they miscarried, it will be unnecessary to particularize. It may not be amiss, however, to record an exem∣plary act of justice done by the commons on a per∣son belonging to a public office, whom they de∣tected in the practice of fraud and imposition. Not∣withstanding the particular care taken in the last session to prevent the monopolizing of tickets in the state-lottery, all those precautions had been eluded in a scandalous manner by certain individu∣als, intrusted with the charge of delivering the tickets to the contributors according to the intent of the act, which expresly declared, that not more than twenty should be sold to any one person.</P>
<P>Instead of conforming to these directions of the legislature, they and their friends engrossed great numbers, sheltering themselves under a false list of feigned names for the purpose; by which means they not only defeated the equitable intention of the commons, but in some measure injured the public credit; inasmuch as their avarice had prompted them to subscribe for a greater number than they had cash to purchase; so that there was a deficiency in the first payment, which might have had a bad effect on the public affairs. These practices were so flagrant and notorious as to attract the notice of the lower house, where an inquiry was begun and
<PB N="191" REF="1970"/>
prosecuted with a spirit of real patriotism, in oppo∣sition<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> to a scandalous cabal, who endeavoured with equal eagerness and perseverance to screen the de∣linquent. All their efforts, however, proved abor∣tive; and a committee, appointed to examine par∣ticulars, agreed to several severe resolutions against one L—, who had amassed a large fortune by this and other kinds of peculation. They voted him guilty of breach of trust, and a direct violation of the lottery-act; and an address was presented to his majesty, desiring he might be prosecuted by the attorney▪general for these offences. He was ac∣cordingly sued in the court of King's Bench, and payed a fine of one thousand pounds, for having committed frauds by which he had gained forty times that sum; but he was treated with such gen∣tleness as remarkably denoted the clemency of that tribunal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Close of the last session of this par∣liament.</NOTE> The session ended in the beginning of April, when the king gave the parliament to understand that he should say nothing at present on foreign affairs; but assured him of his fixed resolution to exert his whole power in maintaining the general tranquillity, and adhering to such measures for that purpose, as he had hitherto pursued in conjunction with his allies. He in very affectionate terms thank∣ed both houses for the repeated proofs they had given of their zealous attachment and loyalty to his per∣son and government. He enumerated the salutary measures they had taken for lessening the national debt, and augmenting the public credit, extending navigation and commerce, reforming the morals of the people, and improving the regulations of civil

<P>In a little time after the close of this session they were dissolved by proclamation, and new writs issu∣ed by the lord chancellor for convoking a new par∣liament. The same ceremonies were practised with respect to the convocations of Canterbury and York, though they no longer retained their former impor∣tance; nor, indeed, were they suffered to sit and de∣liberate upon the subjects which formerly fell under their cognizance and discussion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Mr. Pel∣ham, and change in the mini∣stry.</NOTE> In the beginning of March the ministry of Great Britain had been left without a head by the death of Mr. Pelham, which was not only sincerely lamented by his sovereign, but also regretted by the nation in general, to whose affection he had powerfully recommended himself by the candour and humanity of his conduct and character, even while he pursued measures which they did not en∣tirely approve. The less of such a minister was the more deeply felt by the government at this junc∣ture, being the eve of a general election for a new parliament, when every administration is supposed to exert itself with redoubled vigilance and circum∣spection. He had already concerted the measures for securing a majority, and his plan was faithfully executed by his friends and adherents, who still engrossed the administration. His brother, the duke of Newcastle, was appointed first lord com∣missioner of the treasury, and succeeded as secre∣tary of state by Sir Thomas Robinson, who had
<PB N="193" REF="1990"/>
long resided as ambassador at the court of Vienna.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> The other department of this office was still re∣tained by the earl of Holdernesse, and the function of chancellor of the exchequer was performed as usual by the lord chief justice of the King's Bench, until a proper person could be found to fill that important office: but in the course of the summer it was bestowed upon Mr. Legge, who acquitted himself with equal honour and capacity. Divers other alterations were made, of less importance to the public. Sir George Lyttleton was appointed cofferer, and the earl of Hillsborough comptroller of the houshold. Mr. George Greenville, bro∣ther to earl Temple, became treasurer of the navy; and Mr. Charles Townshend, of whom we shall have occasion to speak in the sequel, took place as a commissioner at the board of admiralty, in the room of lord Barrington, made master of the wardrobe. Lord Hardwicke, the chancellor, was promoted to the dignity of earl. The place of lord chief justice of the King's Bench becoming vacant by the death of Sir William Lee, was filled with Sir Dudley Rider, and he was succeeded by Mr. Murray in the office of attorney-general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New par∣liament assembled and pro∣rogued.</NOTE> The elections for the new parliament generally succeeded according to the wish of the ministry; for opposition was now dwindled down to the low∣est state of imbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illity. It had received a mortal wound by the death of the late prince of Wales, whose adherents were too wise to pursue an ignis sat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, without any prospect of success or advan∣tage.

The maxims of Toryism had been relinquished by many, as the barren principles of a losing game: the body of the people were conciliated to the esta∣blished government; and the harmony that now, for the first time, subsisted among all the branches of the royal family, had a wonderful effect in ac∣quiring a degree of popularity which they had never before enjoyed.</P>
<P>The writs being returned, the new parliament was opened on the last day of May by the duke of Cumberland, and some other peers, who acted by virtue of a commission from his majesty.</P>
<P>The commons having chosen for their speaker the right honourable Arthur Onslow, who had honourably filled that high office in four preceding parliaments, he was presented and approved by the commissioners. Then the lord high chancellor ha∣rangued both houses, given them to understand, that his majesty had indulged them with this early opportunity of coming together, in order to com∣pleat, without loss of time, certain parliamentary proceedings, which he judged would be for the satisfaction of his good subjects; but he did not think proper to lay before them any points of ge∣neral business, reserving every thing of that nature to the usual time of their assembling in the winter On the fifth day of June this short session was closed, and the parliament prorogued by the lord▪ commissioners.</P>

commons in Ireland, on the almost forgotten sub∣jects<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> of privilege and prerogative. The commons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes in the par∣liament of Ireland, concern∣ing prero∣gative and privile ge.</NOTE> conceived they had an undoubted right to apply the surplus of their revenue towards national pur∣poses, without the consent of their sovereign; and accordingly, in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and forty-nine, prepared a bill with this pre∣amble: "Whereas on the twenty fifth day of March last a considerable ballance remained in the hands of the vice-treasurers or receivers-general of the kingdom, or their deputy or deputies, unap∣plied; and it will be for your majesty's service, and for the ease of your faithful subjects in this kingdom, that so much thereof as can be conve∣niently spared should be payed, agreeable to your majesty's most gracious intentions, in discharge of part of the national debt."</P>
<P>This appropriation gave great offence to the ad∣vocates for prerogative in England, who affirmed, that the commons had no right to apply any part of the unappropriated revenue, nor even to take any such affair into consideration, without the pre∣vious consent of the crown, expressed in the most explicit terms. It was in consequence of this doc∣trine, that the duke of Dorset, lord lieutenant of Ireland, told them in the next session of parliament, held in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-one, he was commanded by the king to ac∣quaint them, that his majesty, ever attentive to the ease and happiness of his subjects, would gra∣ciously consent, and recommended it to them, that such a part of the money then remaining in his treasury, as should be thought consistent with

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> the public service, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e applied towards the further reduction of the national debt.</P>
<P>This declaration alarmed the commons, zealous as they were for the preservation of their privileges, and in their address of thanks, which, like that of the parliament of Great-Britain, used always to eccho back the words of the speech, they made no mention of his majesty's consent; but only ac∣knowledged his gracious attention to their ease and happiness, in recommending to them the application of the surplus. They accordingly resolved to apply one hundred and twenty thousand pounds of that overplus towards a discharge of the national debt; and in the preamble of the bill, framed for this purpose, made no mention of his majesty's consent, though before they had acknowledged his good∣ness in recommending this application.</P>
<P>The ministry in England were highly offended at this purposed omission, which they construed into a wilful encroachment on the prerogative; and the bill was sent back with an alteration in the pre∣amble, signifying his majesty's consent as well as recommendation.</P>
<P>The Irish house of commons being at that time deeply engaged in a minute inquiry into the con∣duct of a gentleman, a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ant to the crown, and a member of their own house, accused of having misapplied a large sum of money with which he had been intrusted, for rebuilding or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the barracks, were n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them∣selves fur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her with the government, until his affair should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> They therefore passed the bill with the alteration, and proceeded with their in∣quiry.
<PB N="197" REF="2040"/>
The person was convicted of having mis∣applied<NOTE PLACE="marg">An: 1754.</NOTE> the public money, and ordered to make the barracks fit for the reception and accommoda∣tion of the troops, at his own expence. They did not, however, neglect to assert what they thought their rights and privileges, when the next oppor∣tunity occurred.</P>
<P>The duke of Dorset, when he opened the session of this year, repeated the expression of his majesty's gracious consent, in mentioning the surplus of the public money. They again omitted that word in their address; and resolved, in their bill of appli∣cation, not only to sink this odious term, but like∣wise to abate in their com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance to the crown, by leaving out that expression of grateful acknow∣ledgment, which had met with such a cold recep∣tion above.</P>
<P>By this time the contest had kindled up two violent factions, and diffused a general spirit of resentment through the whole Irish nation. The committee who prepared the bill, instead of insert∣ing the usual compliments in the preamble, men∣tioned nothing but a recital of facts, and sent it over in a very plain dress, quite destitute of all em∣broidery. The ministry, intent upon vindicating the prerogative from such an unmannerly attack, filled up the omissions of the committee, and sent it back with this alteration: "And your majesty, ever attentive to the ease and happiness of your faithful subjects, has been graciously pleased to sig∣nify that you would consent, and to recommend it to us, that so much of the money remaining in your majesty's treasury as should be necessary, be applied to the discharge of the national debt, or
<PB N="198" REF="2050"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> such part thereof as should be thought expedient by parliament." This then being the crisis, which was to determine a constitutional point of such im∣portance, namely, whether the people in parlia∣ment assembled have a right to deliberate upon, and vote the application of any part of the unap∣propriated revenue, without the previous consent of the crown; those who were the most zealously attached to the liberties of their country, resolved to exert th mselves in opposing what they con∣ceived to be a violation of these liberties; and the bill, with its alterations, was rejected by a majority of five voices. The success of their endeavours was celebrated with the most extravagant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as a triumph of patriotism over the arts of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> corruption; and, on the other hand, all the servants of the crown, who had joined the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ular cry on this occasion, were in a little time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from their employments.</P>
<P>The rejection of the bill was a great disappoint∣ment the creditors of the public, and the circu∣lation of cash was almost stagnated.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the English settle∣ments along the coasts of Malabar and Co∣roman∣del.</NOTE> The next English settlement to Surat, on the coast of the peninsula, is Bombay, in the kingdom of Decan, a small island, with a very convenient harbour, about five and forty leagues to the south of Surat. The town is very populous: but the soil is barren and the climate unhealthy; and the commerce was rendered very precarious by the neighbourhood of the famous corsair Angria, un∣til his port of Geriah was taken, and his fortifica∣tions demolished. The English company likewise carry on some traffic at Dabul, about forty leagues farther to the south, in the province of Cuncan. In the same southerly progression, towards the point of the peninsula, we arrive at Carwar, in the lati∣tude of fifteen degrees, where there is a small fort and factory belonging to the company, standing on the south side of a bay, with a river capable of
<PB N="201" REF="2090"/>
receiving ships of pretty large burthen. The cli∣mate<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> here is remarkably salubrious; the country abounds with provisions of all sorts, and the best pepper of India grows in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The next English settlement we find at Til∣lechery, where the company has erected a fort, to defend their commerce of pepper and cardamoms from the insults of the rajah, who governs this part of Malabar. Hither the English trade was removed from Calicut, a large town, that stands fifteen leagues to the southward of Tillechery, and was as well frequented as any port on the coast of the Indian peninsula.</P>
<P>The most southerly settlement which the Eng∣lish possess on the Malabar coast is that of Anjengo, between the eighth and ninth degrees of latitude. It is defended by a regular fort, situated on a broad river which falls into the sea, and would be very commodious for trade, were not the water on the bar too shallow to admit ships of considerable bur∣then.</P>
<P>Then turning the cape, and passing through the strait of Chilao, formed by the island of Ceylon, we arrive on the coast of Coromandel, which forms the eastern side of the isthmus. Prosecuting our course in a northern direction, the first English factory we reach is that of Fort St. David's, formerly called Tegapatan, situated in the latitude of eleven de∣grees forty minutes north, within the kingdoms of Gingi. It was, about six and twenty years ago, sold by a Marahatta prince to the East India com∣pany, and, next to Bombay, is the most consider∣able settlement we have yet mentioned. Its terri∣tory extends about eight miles along the coast, and
<PB N="202" REF="2100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> half that space up the country, which is delight∣fully watered by a variety of rivers: the soil is fer∣tile, and the climate healthy. The fort is regular, well provided with cannon, ammunition, and a numerous garrison, which is the more necessary on account of the neighbourhood of the French set∣tlement at Pondicherry. The trade consists in long cloths of different colours, sallampores, morees, dimitties, ginghams, and succatoons.</P>
<P>But the chief settlement belonging to the com∣pany on this coast is that of Madrass, or Fort St. George, standing farther to the northward, be∣tween the thirteenth and fourteenth degrees of lati∣tude, and not a great way from the diamond mines of Golconda. It is seated on a flat, barren, scorch∣ing sand, so near the sea, that, in bad weather, the walls are endangered by the mighty surges rolled in from the ocean. As the soil is barren, the cli∣mate is so intensely hot, that it would be altogether uninhabitable, were not the heat mitigated by the sea-breezes. On the land side it is defended by a salt-water river, which, while it contributes to the security of the place, robs the inhabitants of one great comfort, by obstructing the springs of fresh water. The fort is a regular square, the town sur∣rounded with walls well mounted with artillery, and the place, including the Black Town, is very populous. Madrass, with several villages in the neighbourhood, was purchased of the king of Gol∣conda, before the Mogul became sovereign of this country. The governor of this place is not only president of Fort St. George, but also of all the other settlements on the coasts of Malabar and Co∣romandel as far as the island of Sumatra. He lives
<PB N="203" REF="2110"/>
in great pomp, having inferior judges who pass<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> sentence of death occasionally on malefactors of any nation, except the subjects of Great Britain. All the company's affairs are directed by him and his council, who are invested with the power of inflicting corporal punishment, short of life and member, upon such Europeans as are in the ser∣vice, and dispose of all places of trust and profit. By virtue of an act passed in the course of this very session, the military officers belonging to the com∣pany were permitted to hold courts-martial, and punish their soldiers according to the degree of their delinquency. In a word, Madrass is of the utmost importance to the company for its strength, wealth, and the great returns it makes in calicoes and muslins.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of the last century the English company had a flourishing factory at Mas∣sulipatam, standing on the north side of the river Nagundi, which separates the provinces of Gol∣conda and Bisnagar, in the latitude of sixteen de∣grees and thirty minutes; but now there is no Eu∣ropean settlement here, except a Dutch factory, maintained for carrying on the chintz commerce.</P>
<P>At Visigapatam, situated still farther to the northward, the English possess a factory, regularly fortified, on the side of a river, which, however, a dangerous bar has rendered unfit for navigation. The adjacent country affords cotton cloths, and the best striped muslins of India. It is chiefly for the use of this settlement, that the company maintains a factory at Ganjam, the most eastern town in the province or kingdom of Golcon∣da, situated in a country abounding with rice
<PB N="204" REF="2120"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> and sugar canes. Still farther to the north coast, in the latitude of twenty-two degrees, the company maintains a factory at Balasore, which was formerly very considerable; but hath been of little conse∣quence since the navigation of the river Huguely was improved. At this place every European ship bound for Bengal and the Ganges takes in a pilot. The climate is not counted very salubrious; but the adjacent country is fruitful to admiration, and here are considerable manufactures of cotton and silk. Without skilful pilots, the English would find it very difficult to navigate the different chan∣nels through which the river Ganges discharges it∣self into the sea at the bottom of the bay of Ben∣gal. On the southern branch is a town called Pi∣pely, where there was formerly an English fac∣tory: but this was removed to Huguely, one hun∣dred and sixty miles farther up the river; a place which, together with the company's settlement at Calcutta, were the emporiums of their commerce for the whole kingdom of Bengal. Indeed Huguely is now abandoned by the English, and their whole trade centers at Calcutta or Fort William, which is a regular fortification, containing lodgings for the factors and writers, store-houses for the com∣pany's merchandize, and magazines for their am∣munition. As for the governor's house, which likewise stands within the fort, it is one of the most regular structures in all India. Besides these settlements along the sea-coast of the peninsula, and on the banks of the Ganges, the English East-In∣dia company possess certain inland factories and posts for the convenience and defence of their com∣merce, either purchased of the nabobs and rajahs,
<PB N="205" REF="2130"/>
or conquered in the course of the war. As the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> operations we propose to record, were confined to the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel, or the in∣terior countries which form the peninsula intra Gangem, it will be unnecessary to describe the fac∣tory at Bencoolen on the island of Sumatra, or any settlement which the English possess in other parts of the East Indies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispute about the govern∣ment of Arcot.</NOTE> In order to understand the military transactions of the English company in India, the reader will take notice, that immediately after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, Monsieur du Pleix, who com∣manded for the French in that country, began by his intrigues to sow the seeds of dissension among the nabobs, that he might be the better able to fish in troubled waters. Sundah Saheb, nabob of Arcot, having been deposed by the great Mogul, who placed Anawerde Khan in his room, he re∣solved to recover his government by force, and had recourse to the French general at Pondicherry, who reinforced him with two thousand sipoys, or sol∣diers of the country, sixty kafres, and four hun∣dred and twenty French troops, on condition that if he proved successful in his enterprize, he should cede to the French the town of Velur in the neigh∣bourhood of Pondicherry, with its dependencies, consisting of forty-five villages. Thus reinforced, he defeated his rival Anawerde Khan, who lost his life in the engagement, reassumed the government of Arcot, and punctually performed the condi∣tions which had been stipulated by his French allies.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mahommed Ali Khan, son of the deceased nabob, fled to Tiruchirapalli, and so∣licited

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> the assistance of the English, who favoured<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahom∣med Ali Khan is supported by the English company.</NOTE> him with a reinforcement of money, men, and am∣munition, under the conduct of major Laurence, a brave and experienced officer. By dint of this supply, he gained some advantages over the enemy, who were obliged to retreat; but no decisive blow was given. Mahommed afterwards repaired in person to Fort St. David's to demand more pow∣erful succours, alledging that his fate was con∣nected with the interest of the English company, which in time would be obliged to abandon the whole coast, should they allow the enemy to pro∣ceed in their conquests. In consequence of these representations, he received another strong rein∣forcement under the command of captain Cope; but nothing of importance was attempted, and the English auxiliaries retired. Then Mahommed was attacked by the enemy, who obtained over him a complete victory. Finding it impossible to main∣tain his footing by his own strength, he entered into a close alliance with the English, and ceded to them some commercial points, which had been long in dispute. Then they detached captain Cope to put Tiruchirapalli in a posture of defence; while captain Gingen, a Swiss officer, marched at the head of four hundred Europeans to the nabob's assistance. The two armies being pretty equal in strength, lay encamped in sight of each other a whole month; during which nothing happened but a few skirmishes, which generally terminated to the advantage of the English auxiliaries.</P>
<P>In order to make a diversion, and divide the French forces, the company resolved to send a de∣tachment into the province of Arcot; and this was
<PB N="207" REF="2150"/>
the first occasion upon which the extraordinary ta∣lents<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> of Mr. Clive were displayed. He had entered into the service of the East India company as a writer, and was considered as a person very indif∣ferently qualified for succeeding in any civil sta∣tion of life. He now offered his service in a mili∣tary capacity, and actually began his march to Ar∣cot, at the head of two hundred and ten Europeans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Clive takes pos∣session of Arcot, in which he is be∣sieged.</NOTE> Such was the resolution, secrecy, and dispatch with which he conducted this enterprize, that the enemy knew nothing of his motions until he was in possession of the capital, which he took without opposition. The inhabitants, expecting to be plundered, offered him a large sum to spare their city; but they derived their security from the ge∣nerosity and discretion of the conqueror. He re∣fused the profered ransom, and issued a proclama∣tion, intimating, That those who were willing to remain in their houses should be protected from insult and injury, and the rest have leave to retire with all their effects, except provisions, for which he promised to pay the full value. By this sage conduct he conciliated the affections of the people so intirely, that even those who quitted the place supplied him with exact intelligence of the enemy's designs, when he was besieged in the sequel. The town was in a little time invested by the French nabob, Sundah Saheb, at the head of a numerous army, and the operations of the siege were con∣ducted by European engineers. Though their ap∣proaches were retarded by the repeated and reso∣lute sallies of Mr. Clive, they at length effected two breaches, supposed to be practicable; and on the fourteenth day of October, in the year one
<PB N="208" REF="2160"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> thousand seven hundred and fifty-one, gave a ge∣neral assault. Mr. Clive, having received intima∣tion of their design, had made such preparations for their reception, that they were repulsed in every quarter with great loss, and obliged to raise the siege with the utmost precipitation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He de∣feats the enemy in the plains of Arani, and ob∣tains a se∣cond com∣plete vic∣tory over them at Koveri∣pauk.</NOTE> This gailant Englishman, not contented with the reputation he had acquired from his noble de∣fence, was no sooner reinforced by a detachment under captain Kirkpatrick, than he marched in pursuit of the enemy, whom he overtook in the plains of Arani. There, on the third day of De∣cember, he attacked them with irresistible impe∣tuosity; and, after an obstinate dispute, obtained a complete victory at a very small expence. The cities of Arani and Kajevaran surrendered to the terror of his name, rather than to the force of his arms; and he returned to Fort St. David's in tri∣umph. He had enjoyed a very few weeks of re∣pose, when he was summoned to the field by fresh incursions of the enemy. In the beginning of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two, he marched with a small detachment to Madrass, where he was joined by a reinforcement from Bengal, the whole number not exceeding three hundred Euro∣peans, and assembled a body of the natives, that he might have at least the appearance of an army. With these he proceeded to Koveripauk, about fifteen miles from Arcot, where he found the French and Indians, consisting of fifteen hundred sipoys, seventeen hundred horse, a body of na∣tives, and one hundred and fifty Europeans, with eight pieces of cannon. Though they were ad∣vantageously posted and intrenched, and the day
<PB N="209" REF="2170"/>
was already far advanced, Mr. Clive advanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> against them with his usual intrepidity; but the victory remained for some time in suspence. It was now dark, and the battle doubtful, when Mr. Clive sent round a detachment to fall on the rear of the French battery. This attack was executed with great resolution, while the English in front entered the intrenchments with their bayonets fix∣ed; and, though very little tinctured with disci∣pline, displayed the spirit and activity of hardy veterans. This double attack disconcerted the enemy in such a manner, that they soon desisted from all opposition. A considerable carnage en∣sued; yet the greater part of the enemy, both horse and foot, saved themselves by flight, under cover of the darkness. The French, to a man, threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves pri∣soners of war; and all the cannon and baggage fell into the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>The province of Arcot being thus cleared of the enemy, Mr. Clive with his forces returned to Fort St. David's, where he found major Laurence just arrived from England, to take upon him the com∣mand of the troops in the company's service. On the eighteenth day of March this officer, accom∣panied by Mr. Clive, took the field, and was joined by captain Gingen at Tiruchirapalli. From hence he detached Mr. Clive with four hundred Euro∣pean soldiers, a few Marahatta horse, and a body of sipoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondi∣cherry. In the course of this expedition he dis∣lodged a strong body of the foe posted at Samea∣varem, and obliged Sundah Saheb to throw a body of troops into a strong fortified temple upon

The commanding officer, in attempting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Clive reduces three forts, and takes Mr. D'Anteuil prisoner.</NOTE> to escape, was slain with some others, and the rest surrendered at discretion. They were still in pos∣session of another fortified temple, which he also besieged in form, and reduced by capitulation. Having subdued these forts, he marched directly to Golconda, whither he understood the French commander had retired. He found that officer in∣trenched in a village, from whence he drove him with precipitation, and made himself master of the French cannon. The enemy attempted to save themselves in a neighbouring fort; but the gates being shut against them by the governor, who was apprehensive that they would be followed pell-mell by the English, Mr. Clive attacked them with great fury, and made a considerable slaughter: but his humanity being shocked at this carnage, he sent a flag of truce to the vanquished with terms of capi∣tulation, which they readily embraced. These articles imported, That D'Anteuil, and three other officers, should remain prisoners on parole for one year; that the garrison should be exchanged; and the money and stores be delivered to the nabob whom the English supported.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundah Saheb taken and put to death, and his army totally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> During these transactions Sundah Saheb lay en∣camped with an army of thirty thousand men at Syrinham, an island in the neighbourhood of Ti∣ruchirapalli, which he longed eagerly to possess. Hither major Laurence marched with his Indian allies, and took his measures so well, that the ene∣my's provisions were entirely intercepted. Sundah Saheb, in attempting to fly, was taken prisoner by the nabob of Tanjour, an ally of the English com∣pany,
<PB N="211" REF="2190"/>
who ordered his head to be struck off, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754</NOTE> order to prevent the disputes which otherwise would have risen among the captors. The main body of the army being attacked by major Lau∣rence, and totally defeated, the island of Syrin∣ham was surrendered, and about a thousand Euro∣pean French soldiers fell into the hands of the con∣querors, including thirty officers, with forty pieces of cannon and ten mortars. The English and their allies having obtained divers other successive advantages, Mr. Dupleix recalled all his regulars from the Indian army, and acted upon the defen∣sive.</P>
<P>The French company in France, discouraged by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conven∣tion be∣tween the East India compa∣nies of England and France.</NOTE> these repeated misfortunes, sent over, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three, one Mr. Duvelar as their commissary, who, with a view to restore peace in the East Indies, concluded a convention with the English company; by which it was stipulated, that the two companies should reciprocally restore the territories taken by the troops of either since the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-eight, except certain districts, which the English detained for the conveniency of their traffic; that the nabobs advanced through the influence of either party, should be acknow∣ledged by both; and that, for the future, neither should interfere in the differences between the princes of the country.</P>
<P>How pacific soever the sentiments of the French subjects might have been at this period in the East Indies, certain it is, the designs of the French go∣vernors in America were altogether hostile, and their conduct hastening towards a rupture, which
<PB N="212" REF="2200"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> hath kindled up a bloody war in every division of the globe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A general view of the British colonies in North America.</NOTE> As this war may be termed a native of America, and the principal scenes of it have been acted on that continent, we shall, for the information of the reader, sketch out the situation of the British colo∣nies as they border on each other, and extend along the sea-coast from the gulph of St. Laurence as far south as the country of Florida. We shall enume∣rate the Indian nations that lie scattered about their confines, and delineate the manner in which the French have hemmed them in by a surprising line of fortifications. Should we comprehend Hud∣son's bay, with the adjacent countries, and the banks of Newfoundland, in this geographical de∣tail, we might affirm that Great Britain possesses a territory, along the sea-coast, extending seventeen hundred miles in a direct line, from the sixtieth to the thirty-first degree of northern latitude: but as these two countries have not yet been concerned in the present dispute, we shall advance from the northward to the southern side of the gulph of St. Laurence; and beginning with Acadie, or Nova Scotia, describe our settlements as they lie in a southerly direction as far as the gulph of Florida.</P>
<P>This great tract of country, stretching fifteen degrees of latitude, is washed on the east by the Atlantic ocean: the southern boundary is Spanish Florida; but to the westward the limits are uncer∣tain, some affirming, that the jurisdiction of the colonies penetrates through the whole continent as far as the South-sea; while others, with more moderation, think they are naturally bounded by the river Illinois that runs into the Mississippi, and
<PB REF="2210"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="213" REF="2220"/>
in a manner connects that river with the chain of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> lakes known by the names of Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, the three first communicating with each other, and the last discharging itself in the river of St. Laurence, which, running by Montreal and Quebec, issues in the bay of the same denomination, forming the northern boundary of Nova Scotia. The French who had no legal claim to any lands on the south side of this river, have nevertheless, with an insolence of ambition peculiar to themselves, not only extended their forts from the source of the St. Laurence, through an im∣mense tract of country as far as the Mississippi, which disembogues itself into the gulph of Florida; but also, by a series of unparalleled encroachments, have endeavoured to contract the English colonies within such narrow limits as will cut off almost one half of their possessions.</P>
<P>As we have already given a geographical de∣scription of Nova Scotia, and mentioned the par∣ticulars of the new settlement of Halifax, we shall now only observe, that it is surrounded on three sides by the sea, the gulph, and river of St. Lau∣rence; that its original boundary to the west was the river Pentagoet; but it is now contracted within the river St. Croix, because the crown of Great Britain did, in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-three, grant to the duke of York the territory of Sagudahac, stretching from St. Croix to the river of this name; which was, in the sequel, by an express charter from the crown, annexed to the province of the Massachuset's bay, one of the four governments of New England. This country situated next to Nova Scotia, lies
<PB N="214" REF="2230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> between the forty-first and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude, extending near three hundred miles in length, and about two hundred in breadth, if we bound it by those tracts which the French have possessed: no part of the settlements of this coun∣try, however, stretches above sixty miles from the sea. The summer is here intensely hot, and the winter proportionably severe: nevertheless the cli∣mate is healthy, and the sky generally serene. The soil is not favourable to any of the European kinds of grain; but produces great plenty of maiz, which the people bake into bread, and brew into beer, though their favourite drink is made of mo∣lasses hopped, and impregnated with the tops of the spruce-fir, which is a native of this country. The ground raises good flax and tolerable hemp. Here are great herds of black cattle, some of them very large in size, a vast number of excellent hogs, a breed of small horses, graceful, swift, and hardy; and large flocks of sheep, whose wool, though not so fine as that of England, is manufactured with great success.</P>
<P>The people mostly consist of a substantial yeo∣manry, who cultivate their own freeholds, and breathe the true spirit of independence, which is encouraged by a republican form of government, as well as of religion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Eng∣land.</NOTE> New England is composed of the four provinces known by the names of New Hampshire, Massa∣chuset's Bay, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, con∣federated for their common defence.</P>
<P>The province of the Massachuset's Bay is ruled by a governor, a lieutenant-governor, a council, and an assembly. The two first places, together
<PB N="215" REF="2240"/>
with the militia, the chief posts in the law and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> revenue, are in the disposal of the crown; but the council is chosen by the representatives of the peo∣ple; yet the governor has a negative, from which he derives very considerable influence.</P>
<P>The colony of Connecticut enjoys still greater privileges.</P>
<P>Rhode Island is the smallest of the four, consist∣ing of the island so called, and the old plantation of Providence. Their charter is the same with that of Connecticut, and the province is extremely populous; a circumstance intirely owing to an un∣limited freedom of religion, with which the inha∣bitants are indulged.</P>
<P>New Hampshire, the most northern of the four, is the least populous; perhaps because it is a royal government, the crown having the nomination of all the officers of justice, the militia, and the mem∣bers of the council.</P>
<P>These four provinces contain about three hun∣dred and fifty thousand inhabitants, including a small number of Blacks and Indians, from which an excellent militia might be raised. This coun∣try abounds with trading towns; and Boston, the capital of Massachuset's Bay, is the first city of all North America, seated on a peninsula, at the bot∣tom of a fine capacious harbour, defended from the violence of the sea by a number of islands, and rocks, which appear above water. The entrance, which is narrow, is defended by the cannon of a regular fortress. This town contains ten churches, and about twenty thousand inhabitants, who carry on a very considerable commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="2250"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> The commodities of New England consist of masts and yards, pitch, tar, and turpentine, staves, lumber, boards, beef, pork, butter, cheese, Indian corn, and pease, cyder, apples, hemp, and flax, horses, and live cattle. The trade in peltry is not very considerable; but their fishery employs a vast number of people, and above thirty-two thousand quintals of cod-fish are annually exported from New England to Spain, Italy, and the Mediter∣ranean. About nineteen thousand quintals of an inferior sort are sent to the West Indies, for the use of the negroes. From the sugar-islands the traders of New England import a vast quantity of mo∣lasses, from which they distil spirits sufficient al∣most to supply the other British colonies in North-America, the Indian trade of that continent, the Newfoundland fishery, and their commerce to the coast of Guinea.</P>
<P>A great number of ships for sale are built at Boston, and other towns in New England; and, with respect to trade, the inhabitants are carriers for all the other colonies. They have set up ma∣nufactures for hats, woollen, and linnen, and ex∣ceed all the other colonists in industry, and cou∣rage. The French have intruded themselves a considerable way into the northern part of New Hampshire, where they built the fort of Cohasser.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New York.</NOTE> New England is bounded on the south by New-York, extending northerly, on both sides of the river Hudson, about two hundred miles into the country possessed by the Indians of the Five Na∣tions, whom the French distinguish by the name of the Iroquois; but in breadth this province does not exceed fifty miles, though it comprehends
<PB N="217" REF="2260"/>
Long Island, lying to the southward of Connecti∣cut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> remarkable for yielding plenty of grain, excel∣lent pasture, with a great number of horses, sheep, and oxen.</P>
<P>The capital, which from the province derives the name of New York, is situated on an excellent harbour in the island Manahatton, extending four∣teen miles in length, and five in breadth, at the mouth of the noble river Hudson, which is na∣vigable for above two hundred miles. The city of New York is neatly built, adorned with four churches, and contains about eight thousand inha∣bitants, the descendants of English and Dutch, who enjoy a flourishing trade in corn, flour, and other species of provision.</P>
<P>At the distance of one hundred and fifty miles from New York stands the town of Albany, upon the same river, which, though neither large nor populous, drives a great trade with the Indians, who are here supplied with coarse woollen cloths and shirts, guns, hatchets, knives, hoes, kettles, powder and shot, with divers other articles. In this place all the treaties and other transactions are negociated between the English and the Iroquois, a confederacy of five Indian nations, who, by their union, courage, and military skill, had reduced a great number of other Indian tribes, and subdued a territory more extensive than the whole kingdom of France. They were about threescore years ago able to bring ten thousand warriors into the field; but now their number is so greatly diminished by wars, epidemical diseases, and the use of spirituous liquors, that they cannot raise above fifteen hun∣dred men, even though they have admitted into
<PB N="218" REF="2270"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> their confederacy the nation of the Tuscaroras, whom the English drove from the confines of Ca∣rolina.</P>
<P>The number of souls in the province of New York amounts to about fourscore thousand; an hospitable people, who live happily under a general indulgence in liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>The Mohok Indians inhabit the country ad∣vanced from Albany. The northern extremities of New Hampshire and New York are divided by the lakes Champlain and Sacrament, between which the French had raised the fort of Crown-Point, which is now in possession of the English.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Jer∣sey.</NOTE> Contiguous to New York, and lying along the coast, in a southerly direction, is the small pro∣vince of New Jersey, bounded on the west by the river Delaware, which divides it from Pensylvania, extending about one hundred and fifty miles in length, but in breadth not more than one third part of that extent. The climate, soil, and produce of these two provinces, as well as of Pensylvania, are similar. They yield great quantities of grain, sheep, horses, hogs, and horned cattle; all kinds of poultry and game in great abundance; vege∣tables of every sort in perfection, and excellent fruit, particularly peaches and melons. Their vast forests abound with oak, ash, beech, ches∣nut, cedar, walnut-tree, cypress, hickery, sassafras, and pine; but the timber is not counted so fit for shipping as that of New England and Nova Sco∣tia. These provinces produce great quantities of flax and hemp. New York affords mines of iron; and very rich copper ore is found in New Jersey. New Jersey is supposed to contain about sixty thou∣sand

The people of New Jersey send the greater part of their produce to the markets of New York and Pensylvania, to which they are contiguous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pensylva∣nia.</NOTE> Pensylvania, lying to the southward of New York and New Jersey, is bounded on the other side by Maryland, stretching two hundred and fifty miles in length, two hundred in breadth, and having no communication with the sea, except by the mouth of the river Delaware. The inha∣bitants of this flourishing province, which was ori∣ginally settled by quakers under the auspices of the celebrated William Penn, whose descendants are still proprietaries of the country, amount to above two hundred and fifty thousand, one half of which number consists of Dutch, Swedes, and Germans, who live together in admirable harmony, though divided by a surprising diversity of religions, com∣prehending quakers, churchmen, calvinists, lu∣therans, catholics, methodists, moravians, inde∣pendants, anabaptists, and a German sect called dumplers, who live in a kind of religious society, wearing long beards, and a habit resembling that of friars. This province may boast of many con∣siderable towns; but the capital Philadelphia is remarkably large, rich, and flourishing. It stands on a tongue of land, at the confluence of two na∣vigable rivers, the Delaware and the Schulkel, dis∣posed in the form of a regular oblong, and designed by the original plan to extend from the one to the
<PB N="220" REF="2290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> other. The streets, which are broad, spacious, and uniform, cross each other at right angles, leaving proper spaces for churches, markets, and other public edifices. The houses are neatly built of brick, the quays spacious and magnificent, the warehouses large and numerous, and the docks commodious and well contrived for ship-building. The number of inhabitants amount to about fif∣teen thousand, and they carry on a considerable trade with the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch colonies in America, with the Azores, Canaries, Madeira, Great Britain and Ireland, Spain, Portu∣gal, and Holland. The colonists, who cultivate the country, are hardy, industrious, and generally substantial; and the inferior people among them manufacture both linen and woollen cloth for their own wearing. The commodities in which they trade are wheat, flour, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, beef, pork, cheese, butter, cyder, beer, flax, hemp, linseed oil, furs and deer-skins, staves, lum∣ber, and iron. The importance of this colony may be estimated by the value of the imports from England, which in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, amounted to two hun∣dred sixty-eight thousand four hundred and twenty-six pounds, six shillings, and six-pence sterling. The greatest inconvenience to which this province is exposed arises from the pacific principles of the quakers, who engross the greatest share in the go∣vernment, and are generally averse to vigorous measures, even when they seem necessary for their own preservation. Pensylvania is understood to extend as far northerly as the banks of the lake Erie, where the French erected a fort. They raised ano∣ther,
<PB N="221" REF="2300"/>
at some distance to the southward of the river<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> Au-Beuf, and made other encroachments on this colony, which we shall mention in due order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary∣land.</NOTE> Adjoining to part of Pensylvania on the sea-coast lies the province of Maryland, a tract of land si∣tuated along the bay of Chesapeak, in length about one hundred and forty miles, and nearly of the same breadth, bounded on the north by Pensylva∣nia, on the east by the Atlantic ocean, and by the river Potowmack on the south. This country was first planted with Roman catholics by lord Balti∣more, to whom Charles II. granted it by patent. In the sequel, however, people of all religions were admitted into this settlement, and indulged with liberty of conscience, and at present the reigning religion is that of the English church. The cli∣mate is very sultry in summer, and not very salu∣brious. The soil is fruitful, and produces a great quantity of tobacco, which the people cultivate as their staple commodity. The seat of government is established at Annapolis, a small town beautifully situated on the river Patuxent, and here the go∣vernor resides. The number of white inhabitants within this province does not exceed forty thou∣sand; but there are upwards of sixty thousand negroes, employed for the most part in the cul∣ture of tobacco, which they raise annually to the amount of forty thousand hogsheads.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia.</NOTE> Tracing the sea-coast still southerly, the next settlement is Virginia, watered on the north by the river Potowmack, which is the boundary be∣tween this and the colony last described, having the bay of Chesapeak to the east, bounded on the south by Carolina, and extending westward with∣out
<PB N="222" REF="2310"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> any prescribed limits, though the plantations have reached no farther than the great Allegany mountains; so that the province, as now possessed, stretches in length about two hundred and forty miles, and in breadth not above two hundred, lying between the fifty fifth and fortieth degrees of lati∣tude.</P>
<P>In sailing to Virginia, navigators steer through a streight formed by two points called the Capes, into the bay of Chesapeak, a large inlet that runs three hundred miles into the country from south to north, covered from the Atlantic ocean by the eastern side of Maryland, and a small portion of Virginia on the same peninsula. This noble bay is about eighteen miles broad for a considerable space, and seven at its narrowest part, yielding generally nine fathoms depth of water; on both sides it receives many navigable rivers, those on the Virginia side being known by the names of James river, York river, the Rappahannock and Potowmack. This country, especially towards the sea, lies very low and swampy, and the soil is ex∣tremely fertile. The air and weather are variable; the heats of summer excessive; the frosts of winter sudden and intensely cold; so that, upon the whole, the climate is neither very agreeable nor healthy, the people being particularly subject to agues and pleuritic disorders. The province abounds with vast forests of timber: the plains are covered with a sur∣prising luxuriancy of vegetables, flowers, and flower∣ing shrubs, diffusing the most delicious fragrance. The ground yields plenty of corn, and every sort of fruit in great abundance and perfection. Horn∣ed cattle and hogs have here multiplied to admira∣tion,

<P>There are very few towns in Virginia: James∣town, the antient capital, is dwindled down to an inconsiderable village; and Williamsburg is far from being extensive or populous, although the seat of government, where the governor resides, where the assembly and courts of justice are held, and a college hath been established for the study of the arts and sciences.</P>
<P>The number of white people in Virginia may amount to seventy thousand; but the negroes are much more numerous. These are chiefly em∣ployed in the culture of tobacco, the staple com∣modity, of which above forty thousand hogsheads are yearly exported from this province. The na∣tives likewise supply Great Britain with a consider∣able quantity of flax, hemp, iron, staves, walnut-tree, and cedar-planks; and they trade largely with the West Indian Islands in lumber, pitch, tar, corn, and provisions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Carolinas</NOTE> Virginia is bounded to the south by the two Ca∣rolinas, situated between the forty-sixth and thirty-first degrees of latitude; the length amounting to upwards of four hundred miles, and the breadth extending near three hundred, as far as the In∣dian nations called the Catawbas, the Creeks, and Cherokees.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="2330"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> The country of Carolina is divided into two go∣vernments, of which the most northern is the most inconsiderable. The climate in both is the same, as well as the soil: the first is warm, though not unhealthy; the last extremely fertile, yielding every thing in plenty which is produced in Virgi∣nia, besides abundance of excellent oranges, and some commodities which are not found to the north∣ward. North Carolina, though not so opulent, is more populous than the southern part. The chief town, called Edenton, is no better than a trifling village; but the present governor has projected another capital farther south, upon the river Neus. The colonists of North Carolina carry on a con∣siderable traffick in tar, pitch, turpentine, staves, shingles, lumber, corn, peas, pork and beef, to∣bacco, deer-skins, indigo, wheat, rice, bees-w ax, tallow, bacon, and hog's lard, cotton, and squared timber, live cattle, with the skins of beaver, ra∣coon, fox, minx, wild cat, and otter. South Ca∣rolina is much better cultivated; the people are more civilized, and the commerce more important. The capital of this province, called Charles-town, is finely situated at the confluence of two navigable rivers, having the advantage of a commodious harbour. The town, which, for size, beauty, and commerce, may be deemed one of the first in North America, contains about eight hundred houses well built; and is regularly fortified. Here the governor resides, and the assembly is convoked. The merchants are rich and the people in general, gay, liberal, and expensive. Their trade, exclu∣sive of the articles we have already mentioned, as common to this government, and that of North
<PB N="225" REF="2340"/>
Carolina, consists of two chief staple commodities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice and indigo, which they cultivate with great success; and they have likewise made some pro∣gress in the culture of silk, which it is to be hoped will prosper under the cherishing wings of the legi∣slature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Georgia.</NOTE> The most southern of all our settlements on this coast is Georgia, extending about sixty miles from north to south along the sea-shore; but widening in the inland parts to above one hundred and fifty, and stretching almost three hundred from the sea to the Apalachian mountains. This country dif∣fers very little from that of South Carolina, with which it borders; yet the summer is here more hot, and the soil not so fertile.</P>
<P>Savannah, the capital, stands commodiously for trade, about ten miles from the sea, on a river of the same name, navigable with large boats two hundred miles farther up to the second town, called Augusta, a place that flourishes by the Indian trade of skins, which the inhabitants carry on with their neighbours the Creeks, the Chickesaws, and the Cherokees, who are the most numerous and pow∣erful tribes in America.</P>
<P>Georgia is bounded on the south by the river Attamaha, at no great distance from the Spanish fort of St. Augustin. The colony is but thinly inhabited, though it increases in population, and the inhabitants begin to raise large quantities of rice and indigo.</P>
<P>Having thus exhibited a succinct view of the British colonies in North America, for the informa∣tion of the reader, we shall now resume the thread of our history, and particularize the transactions by
<PB N="226" REF="2350"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> which the present year was distinguished on this extensive continent.</P>
<P>The government of England having received nothing but evasive answers from the court of France, rouching the complaints that were made of the encroachments in America, dispatched orders to all the governors of that country to repel force by force, and drive the French from their settle∣ments on the river Ohio. Accordingly the pro∣vinces of Virginia and Pensylvania took this im∣portant affair into their consideration; but, while they deliberated, the French vigorously prosecuted their designs on the other side of the mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French surprise Logs-town on the river Ohio.</NOTE> They surprised Logs-town, which the Virginians had built upon the Ohio; made themselves masters of the Block-house and Truck▪house, where they found skins and other commodities to the amount of twenty thousand pounds, and destroyed all the British traders, except two who found means to escape. At the same time M. de Contrecoeur, with a thousand men and eighteen pieces of can∣non, arrived in three hundred canoes from Venan∣go, a fort they had raised on the banks of the Ohio, and reduced by surprize a British fort which the Virginians had built on the forks of the Mo∣nangahela, that runs into the same river.</P>
<P>These hostilities were followed by divers skir∣mishes between the people of the two nations, which were fought with various success.</P>
<P>At length the governors of the English settle∣ments received orders from England to form a political consederacy, for their mutual defence: and the governor of New York was directed to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations, with a
<PB N="227" REF="2360"/>
view to detach them from the French interest by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> dint of promises and presents of value, sent over for that purpose. A congress was accordingly ap∣pointed at Albany, to which place the governor of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A confe∣rence with the Indians at Albany.</NOTE> New York repaired, accompa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied by commissioners from all the other British set<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lements: but a very small number of Indians arrived, and even these seemed to be indifferent to the advances and ex∣hortations that were made by the English orator. The truth is, the French had artfully weaned them from their attachment to the subjects of Great Bri∣tain. Nevertheless, they accepted the presents, renewed their treaties with the king of England, and even demanded his assistance in driving the French from the posts and possessions they had usurped within the Indian territories.</P>
<P>It was in consequence of the measures here taken, that colonel Washington was detached from Virginia with four hundred men, and occupied a post on the banks of the river Ohio, where he threw up some works, and erected a kind of an oc∣casional fort, in hope of being able to defend him∣self in that situation, until he should be joined by a reinforcement from New York, which however did not arrive. While he remained in this situa∣tion, De Viller, a French commander, at the head of nine hundred men, being on his march to dis∣lodge Washington, detached one Jamonville, an inferior officer, with a small party, and a formal summons to Washington, requiring him to quit the fort, which he pretended was built on ground belonging to the French, or their allies. So little regard was payed to this intimation, that the Eng∣lish fell upon this party, and, as the French af∣firm,
<PB N="228" REF="2370"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> without the least provocation, either slew or took the whole detachment. De Viller, incensed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonel Washing∣ton de∣feated and taken by the French on the Ohio.</NOTE> at these unprovoked hostilities, marched up to the attack, which Washington for some time sustained under manifold disadvantages. At length, how∣ever he surrendered the fort upon capitulation, for the performance of which he left two officers as hostages in the hands of the French; and in his retreat was terribly harrassed by the Indians, who plundered his baggage and massacred his people.</P>
<P>This event was no sooner known in England, than the British ambassador at Paris received direc∣tions to complain of it to the French ministry as an open violation of the peace; but this represen∣tation had no effect.</P>
<P>Both nations by this time foresaw that a rupture would be inevitable, and each resolved to make suitable preparations. France continued to send reinforcements of men, and supplies of ammuni∣tion to Quebec, for the prosecution of her ambi∣tious projects; and the ministry of Great Britain transmitted salutary cautions to the governors of the provinces in North America, exhorting them to join their endeavours for repelling the incursions of the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divisions among the British colonies in Ame∣rica.</NOTE> Such an union as seemed necessary for their common preservation was not easily effected. The different colonies were divided by different views and interests, both religious and political: be∣sides, every settlement was distracted into factions, formed by the governor and the demagogues of the assembly: in other words, an opposition like that in parliament, and a continual struggle be∣tween the liberties of the people and the preroga∣tive
<PB N="229" REF="2380"/>
of the proprietor, whether sovereign or subject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, having de∣manded a certain perquisite, or fee, for every pa∣tent he should pass for land, the assembly voted his demand illegal, arbitrary, and oppressive; de∣clared, that every man who payed it should be deemed an enemy to his country, and sent over an agent to London to solicit the suppression of this imposition. The representatives of the people in Pensylvania wasted the time in vain deliberations and violent disputes with their proprietaries, while the enemy infested their frontiers. The colony of New York was filled with discontent and animosity. Sir Danvers Osborn, who had been appointed go∣vernor of this province, died immediately after his arrival at New York, and the instructions he had received were exposed to public censure. The preamble inveighed severely against the want of duty, allegiance, loyalty, and unanimity, which had lately appeared so notorious in the assembly of that province, who had violated the royal commis∣sion and instructions, by assuming to themselves the power to dispose of public money in the laws which they had occasionally passed. This gentle∣man was therefore directed to insist upon the re∣formation of all those public abuses, and upon the establishment of a certain supply for the service of the government, as well as upon the settlement of a salary for himself. Moreover, his majesty, in these instructions, signified his will and pleasure, That all money raised for the supply and support of government, or upon any emergency for imme∣diate service, should be disposed of and applied pro∣perly to the use for which it might be granted, by
<PB N="230" REF="2390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> warrant from the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council of the province, and no otherwise: That, nevertheless, the assembly should be permitted, from time to time, to view and exa∣mine the accounts of money disposed of, by virtue of laws which they had enacted: That if any mem∣ber of the council, or officer holding place of trust or profit within the government, should, in any manner whatever, give his assent to, or in any wise advise or concur with the assembly in passing any act or vote, whereby the royal prerogative might be lessened or impaired, or any money be raised or disposed of for the public service, contrary to or inconsistent with the method prescribed by these instructions, the governor should forthwith remove or suspend such counsellor or officer so offending, and give an immediate account of his proceedings to the commissioners of trade and plantations. These were peremptory injunctions, which plainly proved, that the ministry was determined to sup∣port the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogative with a high hand; but it must be owned, at the same time, that abundance of provocation had been given by the insolent opposi∣tion of some turbulent individuals, who had exerted all their influence in disturbing and distressing the views and designs of the government.</P>
<P>While the British colonies in America were, by these divisions, in a great measure disabled from making vigorous efforts against the common ene∣my, the administration at home began to exert it∣self for their defence. Officers were appointed for two regiments, consisting of two battalions each, to be raised in America, and commanded by Sir William Pepperel and governor Shirley, who had
<PB N="231" REF="2400"/>
enjoyed the same command in the last war; and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> body of troops was destined for the same service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The he∣reditary prince of Hesse Cas∣sel pro∣fesses the Roman catholic religion.</NOTE> The most remarkable incident that marked this year on the continent of Europe was the conver∣sion of the hereditary prince of Hesse Cassel, who had espoused the princess Mary of England. He now declared himself a Roman catholic, and was supposed to have been cajoled to this profession by the promises of certain powers, who flattered his ambition, in order to weaken the protestant interest in Germany. His father, though deeply affected by his son's apostacy, did not fail to take imme∣diate measures for preventing the evil consequences which might otherwise have flowed from his defec∣tion. He forthwith assembled the states of the landgraviate, in order to take such measures as might appear necessary to maintain the religion, laws, and constitution of the country; and the prince was laid under certain restrictions, which he will not find it an easy task to set aside. It was en∣acted, that when the regency should devolve to him by succession, he should not have it in his power to alter the established laws, or grant any church to persons of the Roman communion, for the public exercise of their religion; and that he should be excluded from all share in the education of his sons, the eldest of whom should be put in posses∣sion of the county of Hanau upon his father's ac∣cession to the regency of the landgraviate. These resolutions were guarantied by the kings of Prus∣sia and Denmark, by the Maritime Powers, and the Evangelic Body of the empire.</P>
<P>The exile of the parliament of Paris, far from having intimidated the other tribunals from per∣forming
<PB N="232" REF="2410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> what they apprehended to be their duty, served only to inflame the discontents of the people, and to animate all the courts of justice to a full ex∣ertion of their authority. The chatelet continued to prosecute those priests who refused the sacrament to persons whose consciences would not allow them to subscribe the bull Unigenitus, even after three of their members were sent to the Bastile. The same prosecutions were carried on, and bold remon∣strances published by the parliaments of Aix and Rouen. In a word, the whole kingdom was filled with such confusion as threatened a total suppres∣sion of justice, a general spirit of disaffection, and universal anarchy. The prelates, mean while, seem∣ed to triumph in the combustion they had raised. They entered into associations to support each other: they intrigued at court, and harrassed the king with insolent declarations, until he grew tired of their proceedings, and opened his eyes to the fatal consequences of their pride and obstinacy. He even took an opportunity of exhorting the arch∣bishop of Paris to act more suitably to the charac∣ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">The par∣liament of Paris recalled from ex∣ile.</NOTE> of a clergyman. He recalled the parliament from exile, and they returned in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the people, who celebrated their arrival at Paris with the most extravagant demonstrations of joy; and the archbishop, not∣withstanding the king's express declaration to the contrary, still persisting in countenancing the re∣cusant priests, was banished to Conflans-sous-Charenton.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Spain and Portugal.</NOTE> In Spain the interest of Great Britain was so warmly espoused, and so powerfully supported by Mr. Wall, who had been resident in England, that
<PB N="233" REF="2420"/>
the French party, though countenanced by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> queen-mother, and sustained with all the influence of the marquis de la Ensenada the prime minister, was totally defeated. The king being convinced that it would be for the interest of his subjects to live on good terms with England, and well ap∣prised of Ensenada's intrigues, ordered that mi∣nister to be arrested and confined, and bestowed upon Mr. Wall the best part of his employments. Nevertheless the Spaniards in the West Indies continued to oppress the subjects of Great Britain employed in cutting logwood in the bay of Hon∣duras; and representations on this head being made to the court of Madrid, the dispute was ami∣cably adjusted between Mr. Wall and Sir Benja∣min Keene the British ambassador. While the in∣terest of Britain thus triumphed in Spain, it seemed to lose ground at the court of Lisbon. His Por∣tuguese majesty had formed vast projects of an ac∣tive commerce, and even established an East In∣dia company: in the mean time he could not help manifesting his chagrin at the great quanti∣ties of gold which were yearly exported from his dominions, as the balance due from his subjects on English commodities. In his endeavours to check this traffic, which he deemed so detrimental to his subjects, he inflicted hardships on the British merchants settled at Lisbon: some were imprison∣ed on frivolous pretences; others deprived of their property, and obliged to quit the kingdom. He insisted upon laying an imposition of two per cen∣tum on all the Portuguese gold that should be ex∣ported; but the profits of the trade would not bear such an exaction. Mean while, there being a
<PB N="234" REF="2430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> scarcity of corn in Portugal, the kingdom was sup∣plied from England; and the people having no∣thing but gold to purchase this necessary supply, the king saw the necessity of conniving at the ex∣portation of his coin, and the trade reverted into its former channel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bri∣tish par∣liament opened.</NOTE> On the fourteenth day of November the king of Great Britain opened the session of parliament with an harangue, which intimated nothing of an approaching rupture. He said, That the general state of affairs in Europe had undergone very little alteration since their last meeting; that he had lately received the strongest assurances from his good brother the king of Spain of friendship and con∣fidence, which he would cultivate with harmo∣ny and good faith. He declared his principal view should be to strengthen the foundation, and secure the duration of a general peace; to improve the present advantages of it for promoting the trade of his good subjects, and protecting those possessions which constituted one great source of their wealth and commerce. Finally, he exhorted them to compleat their plan for appropriating the forfeited estates in the Highlands to the service of the public. He probably avoided mentioning the encroachments of France, that he might supply no handle for debates on the address, which was car∣ried in both houses almost without opposition.</P>
<P>The government seemed determined to humble the insolence of the French councils; and this dis∣position was so agreeable to the people in general, that they begrudged no expence, and heartily con∣curred with the demands of the ministry.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="2440"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> The commons granted for the service of the en∣suing year four millions seventy-three thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted.</NOTE> seven hundred and twenty-nine pounds; one mil∣lion of that sum expresly given for enabling his majesty to augment his forces by land and sea. Thirty-two thousand pounds were allotted as a sub∣sidy to the king of Poland, and twenty thousand to the elector of Bavaria. These gratifications met with little or no opposition in the committee of supply; because it was taken for granted, that, in case of a rupture, France would endeavour to avail herself of her superiority by land, by invading his Britannic majesty's German dominions; and there∣fore it might be necessary to secure the assistance of such allies on the continent. That they prognos∣ticated aright, with respect to the designs of that ambitious power, will soon appear in the course of this history; which will also demonstrate how little dependence is to be placed upon the professed at∣tachment of subsidiary princes.</P>
<P>The supplies were raised by the standing branches of the revenue, the land tax and malt tax, and a lottery for one million; one hundred thousand pounds of it to be deducted for the service of the public, and the remaining nine hundred thousand to be charged on the produce of the sinking fund, at the rate of three per centum per annum, to commence from the fifth day of January in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty▪six.</P>
<P>The civil transactions of this session were con∣fined to a few objects. Divers new regulations were made for encouraging and improving the whale and white herring fishery, as well as for finishing and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill in be∣half of Chelsea pensio∣ners.</NOTE> Mr. Pitt, the paymaster-general of the forces, brought in a bill, which will ever remain a stand∣ing monument of his humanity. The poor dis∣abled veterans, who enjoyed the pension of Chelsea hospital, were so iniquitously oppressed by a set of miscreants, who supplied them with money per ad∣vance, at the most exorbitant rates of usury, that many of them with their families were in danger of starving; and the intention of the government in granting such a comfortable subsistance, was in a great measure defeated. Mr. Pitt, perceiving that this evil originally flowed from the delay of the first payment, which the pensioner could not touch till the expiration of a whole year after he had been put upon the list, removed this necessity of borrowing, by providing in the bill, that half a year's pension should be advanced half a year before it is due; and the practice of usury was effectually pre∣vented by a clause, importing, that all contracts should be void, by which any pension might be mortgaged. This humane regulation was unani∣mously approved, and having passed through both houses with uncommon expedition, received the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford∣shire elec∣tion.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the unanimity manifested by the commons, in every thing relating to the mea∣sures for acting vigorously against the common enemy of the nation, they were remarkably dis∣turbed and divided by a contested election of mem∣bers for Oxfordshire. In the course of this dis∣pute, the strength and influence of what they
<PB N="237" REF="2460"/>
called the old and new interest, or, to speak more<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> intelligibly, of the Tories and Whigs in that county, were fully displayed. The candidates sus∣tained on the shoulders of the old interest, were the lord viscount Wenman, and Sir James Dash∣wood; and their competitors, whom the new in∣terest supported, and of consequence the ministry countenanced, were lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner. Never was any contention of this kind maintained with more spirit and animosity, or car∣ried on at a greater expence. One would have imagined that each side considered it as a dispute which must have determined, whether the nation should enjoy its antient liberty, or tamely submit to the fetters of corruption. Noblemen and gen∣tlemen, clergymen and ladies, employed all their talents and industry in canvassing for either side, throughout every township and village in the county. Scandal emptied her whole quiver of insinuation, calumny, and lampoon; corruption was not remiss in promises and presents: houses of entertainment were opened; and nothing was for some time to be seen but scenes of tumult, riot, and intoxication. The revenue of many an independent prince on the continent would not have been sufficient to afford such sums of money as were expended in the course of this dispute. At length they proceeded to election, and the sheriff made a double return of all the four candidates, so that not one of them could sit, and the county remained without a representative until this ambi∣guous affair could be decided in the house of com∣mons.

<PB N="239" REF="2480"/>
foresaw, such a number of frivolous objections were<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> made, as engrossed the attention of the court till the twenty-seventh day of May; so that they could not begin to answer any of these objections till the twenty▪eighth; and on the thirtieth the sheriff, having closed the scrutiny, made the double return. The proof being exhibited, the counsel insisted, that, as they had established a majority on the poll, and demonstrated that this majority neither was nor could be overthrown by such an unfinished scrutiny, it was incumbent on the other side to proceed upon the merits of the election, by en∣deavouring to overthrow that majority of which their clients were in possession. A question in the house being carried to the same purpose, lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood objected to five hundred and thirty voters on the other side, whom they proposed to disqualify. Their counsel exa∣mined several witnesses, to prove the partiality of the sheriff in favour of lord Parker and Sir Ed∣ward Turner, and to detect these candidates in the practice of bribery; for which purpose they produced a letter in their own hand-writing. They afterwards proceeded to disqualify particular votes, and summed up their evidence on the twenty-first day of January. Then the counsel for the other side began to refute the charge of partiality and corruption; and to answer the ob∣jections that had been made to particular voters. They produced evidence to prove, that customa∣ry freeholds, or customary holdings, had voted at elections in the counties of Glamorgan, Mon∣mouth, Gloucester, Wells, and Hereford; and that the customary tenants of the manor of Wode∣stock,
<PB N="240" REF="2490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> in Oxfordshire, had been reputed capable of voting, and even voted at elections for that county. In a word, they continued to examine evidences, argue and refute, prove and disprove, until the twenty-third day of April, when, after some warm debates and divisions in the house, lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were declared duly elected; and the clerk of the crown was or∣dered to amend the return, by erazing the names of lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood. Many who presumed to think for themselves, without recollecting the power and influence of the admi∣nistration, were astonished at the issue of this dis∣pute; which, however, might have easily been foreseen; inasmuch as, during the course of the proceedings, most, if not all, of the many questions debated in the house, were determined by a great majority in favour of the new interest. A great number of copy-holders had been admitted to vote at this election, and the sheriff incurred no censure for allowing them to take the oath appointed by law to be taken by freeholders: nevertheless the commons carefully avoided determining the que∣stion, Whether copy-holders, possessed of the yearly value of forty shillings, clear of all deduc∣tions, have not a right to vote for knights to re∣present the shire within which their copy-hold estates are situated? This point being left doubt∣ful by the legislature, puts it often in the power of the sheriff to return which of the candidates he pleases to support; for, if the majority of the voting copy-holders adheres to the interests of his favourites, he will admit their votes both on the poll and the scrutiny: whereas, should they be
<PB N="241" REF="2500"/>
otherwise disposed, he will reject them as unqua∣lified.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755▪</NOTE> What effect this practice may have upon the independency of parliament, every person must perceive, who reflects, that in almost all the coun∣ties of England, the high sheriffs are annually ap∣pointed by the minister for the time being.</P>
<P>The attention of the legislature was chiefly turned upon the conduct of France, which pre∣served no medium, but seemed intent upon strik∣ing some important blow, that might serve as a declaration of war. At Brest, and other ports in that kingdom, the French were employed in equip∣ping a powerful armament, and made no scruple to own it was intended for North-America.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Message from the king to the house of com∣mons.</NOTE> Towards the latter end of March, Sir Thomas Robinson, secretary of state, brought a message from the king to the parliament, intimating, That his majesty having at the beginning of the session declared, that his principal object was to preserve the public tranquillity, and at the same time to protect those possessions which constitute one great source of the commerce and wealth of his king∣doms; he now finds it necessary to acquaint the house of commons, that the present situation of affairs make it requisite to augment his forces by sea and land, and to take such other measures as may best tend to preserve the general peace of Eu∣rope, and to secure the just rights and possessions of his crown in America, as well as to repel any attempts whatsoever that may be made to support or countenance any designs which may be formed against his majesty and his kingdoms; and his ma∣jesty doubts not but his faithful commons, on whose affection and zeal he entirely relies, will en∣able

<P>In answer to this message, a very warm and af∣fectionate address was presented to his majesty; and it was on this occasion that the million was granted, for augmenting his forces by sea and land.</P>
<P>The ministry having resolved to send a body of forces to America, to act in conjunction with the provincial troops raised on that continent, it be∣came necessary that the mutiny▪act should be ren▪dered more clear and extensive. When this bill therefore fell under consideration, it was improved<NOTE PLACE="marg">Additio∣nal clause to the mo∣ney-bill.</NOTE> with a new clause, providing, That all officers and soldiers of any troops, being mustered and in pay, which are or shall be raised in any of the British prov nces in America, by authority of the respec∣tive governors or governments hereof, shall, at all times, and in all places, when they happen to join or act in conjunction with his majesty's British forces, be liable to martial law and discipline, in like manner, to all intents and purposes, as the British forces are and shall be subject to the same trial, penalties, and punishments.</P>
<P>The court of Versailles, notwithstanding the as∣siduity and dispatch which they were exerting in equipping armaments and embarking troops for the support of their ambitious schemes in America,
<PB N="243" REF="2520"/>
still continued to amuse the British ministry with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> general declarations, that no hostility was intended, nor the least infringement of the treaty.</P>
<P>The earl of Albemarle, the English ambassador at Paris, having lately died in that city, these assu∣rances were communicated to the court of London by the marquis de Mirepoix, who resided in Eng∣land with the same character, which he had sup∣ported since his first arrival with equal honour and politeness. On this occasion he himself was so far imposed upon by the instructions he had received, that he believed the professions of his court were sincere, and seriously endeavoured to prevent a rupture between the two nations. At length, however, their preparations were so notorious, that he began to suspect the consequence; and the English ministry produced such proofs of their in∣sincerity and double dealing, that he seemed to be struck with astonishment and chag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. He re∣paired to France, and upbraided the ministry of Versailles for having made him the tool of their dissimulation. They referred him to the king, who ordered him to return to London, with fresh assurances of his pacific intentions: but his prac∣tice agreed so ill with his professions, that the am∣bassador had scarce obtained an audience to com∣municate them, when undoubted intelligence ar∣rived, that a powerful armament was ready to sail from Brest and Rochfort. The government of Great-Britain, aroused by this information, imme∣diately took the most expeditious methods for equipping a squadron; and towards the latter end of April, admiral Boscawen sailed with eleven ships of the line and one frigate, having on board a con∣siderable
<PB N="244" REF="2530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> number of land-forces, to attend the mo∣tions of the enemy: but more certain and parti∣cular intelligence arriving soon after, touching the strength of the French fleet, which consisted of twenty five ships of the line, besides frigates and transports, with a great quantity of warlike stores, and four thousand regular troops, commanded by the baron Dieskau, admiral Holbourne was de∣tached with six ships of the line, and one frigate, to reinforce Mr. Boscawen; and a great number of capital ships were put in commission.</P>
<P>In the beginning of May, the French fleet, com∣manded by Mr. Macnamara, an officer of Irish ex∣traction, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed from Brest, directing his course to North-America; but, after having proceeded be∣yond the chops of the English channel, he returned with nine of the capital ships, while the rest of the armament continued their course under the direc∣tion of Mr. Bois de la Mothe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">End of thesession.</NOTE> On the twenty-fifth day of April, the king went to the house of lords, where, after giving the royal assent to the bills then depending; for granting a certain sum out of the sinking-fund, for the relief of insolvent debtors, for the better regulation of the marine forces on shore, for the better raising of marines and seamen, and to several other public and private bills; his majesty put an end to the session of parliament by a speech, in which he ac∣quainted the two houses, That the zeal they had shewn for supporting the honour, rights, and pos∣sessions of his crowns, had afforded him the greatest satisfaction: That his desire to preserve the public tranquillity had been sincere and uniform: That he had religiously adhered to the stipulations of
<PB N="245" REF="2540"/>
the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and made it his care<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> not to injure or offend any power whatsoever; but that he never could entertain a thought of pur∣chasing the name of peace at the expence of suffer∣ing incroachments upon, or of yielding up, what justly belonged to Great-Britain, either by ancient possession, or by solemn treaties: That the vigour and firmness of his parliament, on this important occasion, had enabled him to be prepared for such contingencies as might happen: That if reason∣able and honourable terms of accommodation could be agreed upon, he would be satisfied; and, in all events, rely on the justice of his cause, the effectual support of his people, and the protection of Divine Providence. The parliament was then prorogued to the twenty-seventh of May.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions for war.</NOTE> Whilst all Europe was in suspence about the fate of the English and French squadrons, prepa∣rations for a vigorous sea war were going forward in England with an unparalleled spirit and success. Still the French court flattered itself that Great Britain, out of tenderness to his majesty's German dominions, would desist from hostilities. Mire∣poix continued to have frequent conferences with the British ministry, who made no secret that their admirals, particularly Boscawen, had orders to attack the French ships wherever they should meet them. On the other hand, Mons. de Mirepoix declared, That his master would consider the first gun fired at<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French ambassa∣dor's de∣claration.</NOTE> sea, in an hostile manner, as a declaration of war. This menace, far from intimidating the English, made them redouble their preparations for war. The press for seamen was carried on with extraordi∣nary vigour in all parts of this kingdom, as well as in
<PB N="246" REF="2550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> Ireland; and great premiums were given not only by the government, but also, over and above his majesty's bounty, by almost all the considerable ci∣ties and towns in England, to such as should inlist voluntarily for sailors or soldiers. Other branches of the public service went on with equal alacrity: and such was the eagerness of the people to lend their money to the government, that instead of one million, which was to be raised by way of lottery, three millions eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds were subscribed immediately.</P>
<P>The situation of affairs requiring his majesty to go to Germany this summer, great apprehensions arose in the minds of many, lest the French should either intercept him in his journey, or prevent his return. The earl Poulet had made a motion in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl Pou∣let's mo∣tion a∣gainst his majesty's going to Germany.</NOTE> the house of lords, humbly to represent to his ma∣jesty, "That it was an article in the original act of settlement, by which the succession of these king∣doms devolved to his electoral house, that the king should not go to his foreign dominions without the consent of parliament; and that this was a princi∣pal article in the compact between the crown and the people: That though this article was repealed in the late reign, yet, till of late, it had always been the custom for his majesty to acquaint the parliament with his intended departure to his Ger∣man dominions, both in regard to the true sense and spir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the act that placed him on the throne, as well as for the paternal kindness of his royal heart, and the condescension he had been so good to shew his parliament on all occasions; but that his majesty's declaration of his design to visit his electoral estates had always come on the last day

Such was the purport of this motion; but it was not seconded by any of the other lords.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regency appointed upon the king's go∣ing to Hanover.</NOTE> The general uneasiness, on account of his majes∣ty's departure, was greatly increased by an appre∣hension that there would, during his absence, be no good agreement amongst the regency, which consisted of the following persons: his royal high∣ness William duke of Cumberland; Thomas lord archbishop of Canterbury; Philip earl of Hard∣wicke, lord high chancellor; John earl of Gran∣ville, president of the council; Charles duke of Marlborough, lord privy▪seal; John duke of Rut∣land, steward of the houshold; Charles duke of Graston, lord chamberlain; Archibald duke of Ar∣gyle; the duke of Newcastle, first commissioner of the treasury; the duke of Dorset, master of the horse; the earl of Holderness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, one of the secreta∣ries

<P>His majesty set out from St. James's on the twenty-eighth of April early in the morning, em∣barked at Harwich in the afternoon, landed the next day at Helvoetsluys, and arrived at Hanover on the second of May.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boscaw∣en▪ espe∣dition.</NOTE> Admiral Boscawen, with eleven ships of the line and a f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igate, having taken on board two regi∣ments at Plymouth, sailed from thence on the twenty-seventh of April for the banks of New∣foundland: and, in a few days after his arrival there, the French fleet from Brest came to the same station, under the command of M.

But the thick fogs, which prevail upon tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> coasts, especially at that time of the year, kept the two armaments from seeing each other; and part of the French squadron escaped up the river St. Laurence, whilst another part of them went round, and got into the same river through the streights of Bellisle, by a way which was never known to be attempted before by ships of the line. However, whilst the English fleet lay off cape Race, which is the southern-most point of Newfoundland, and was thought to be the most proper situation for intercepting the enemy, two French ships, the Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. of sixty-four guns, and four hundred and eighty men, and the Lys, pierced for sixty-four guns, but mounting only twenty-two, and having eight companies of land-forces on board, being se∣parated from the rest of their fleet in the fog, fell

<P>Though the taking of these ships, from which the commencement of the war may in fact be dated, fell greatly short of what was hoped for from this expedition; yet, when the news of it reached England, it was of infinite service to the public credit of every kind, and animated the whole na∣tion, who now saw plainly that the government was determined to keep no f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rther measures with the French, but justly to repel force by force, and put a stop to their sending more men and arms to invade the property of the English in Ameri∣ca, as they had hitherto done with impunity. The French, who, for some time, did not even at∣tempt to make reprisals on our shipping, would gladly have chosen to avoid a war at that time, and to have continued extending their incroachments on our settlements, till they had executed their grand plan of securing a communication from the Mississipi to Canada by a line of forts, many of which they had already erected, and had also de∣stroyed one of our's on the Ohio; whilst they en∣deavoured to amuse us with fruitless negociations about the boundaries of Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The am∣bassador of France recalled.</NOTE> Upon the arrival of the news of this action at Paris, the French ambassador, M. de Mirepoix, was recalled from London, and M. de Bussy from

They complained loudly of Boscawen's attacking the ships, as a breach of national faith: but it was just∣ly retorted on the part of England, that their in∣croachments in America had rendered reprisals both justifiable and necessary. The resolution of making them was the effect of mature deliberation in the English council. The vast increase of the French marine of late years, which, in all probabi∣lity, would soon be employed against Great Britain, very properly occasioned an order for making re∣prisals<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders for mak∣ing gene∣ral repri∣sals upon the French.</NOTE> general in Europe as well as in America; and that all the French ships, whether outward or homeward bound, should be stopt and brought in∣to British ports. To give the greater weight to these orders, it was resolved to send out those ad∣mirals who had distinguished themselves most towards to the end of the last war. Accordingly, on the twenty first of July, Sir Edward Hawke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruises of the ad∣mirals Hawke and Byng.</NOTE> sailed on a cruize to the westward with eighteen ships of the line, a frigate and a sloop; but, not meeting with the French fleet, these ships returned to England about the latter end of September and the beginning of October; on the fourteenth of which last month another fleet, consisting of twenty-two ships of the line, two frigates, and two sloops, sailed again on a cruise to the westward under ad∣miral Byng, in hopes of intercepting the French squadron under Duguay, and likewise that com∣manded by La Mothe, in case of its return from America. But this fleet likewise returned to Spit∣head on the twenty-second of November, without having been able to effect any thing, though it
<PB N="251" REF="2610"/>
was allowed by all, that the admiral had acted ju∣diciously<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> in the choice of his stations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions for war con∣tinued.</NOTE> While these measures were pursuing, for the ge∣neral security of the British coasts and trade in Eu∣rope, several new ships of war were begun, and worked at with the utmost expedition, in his ma∣jesty's docks: twelve frigates and sloops, con∣tracted for in private yards, were finished by the month of August; and twenty-four ships and twelve colliers were then taken into the service of the government, to be fitted out as vessels of war, to carry twenty guns and a hundred and twenty men each.</P>
<P>To give the greater spirit to the English sailors, and to encourage the workmen in the dock yards, his royal highness the duke of Cumberland went this summer to Portsmouth, where he was received with the greatest honours; and the lord Anson, with other lords of the admiralty, visited that place, and several other parts of the kingdom, in order to forward the maritime preparations.</P>
<P>In the mean time the French trade was so an∣noyed<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade of the French greatly distressed.</NOTE> by the English cruisers, that, before the end of this year, three hundred of their merchant-ships, many of which, from St. Domingo and Martinico, were extremely rich, and eight thousand of their sailors, were brought into English ports. By these captures the British ministry answered many pur∣poses: they deprived the French of a great body of seamen, and with-held from them a very large proper∣ty, the want of which greatly distressed their people, and ruined many of their traders. Their outward∣bound merchant ships were insured at the rate of thirty per cent. whilst the English paid no more than
<PB N="252" REF="2620"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the common insurance. This intolerable burden was felt by all degrees of people amongst them: their ministry was publicly reviled, even by their parliaments; and the French name, from being the terror, began to be the contempt of Europe. Their uneasiness was also not a little heightened by new broils between their king and the parliament of Paris, occasioned by the obstinacy of the clergy of that kingdom, who seemed determined to sup∣port the church, in all events, against the secular tribunals, and, as much as possible, to enforce the observance of the bull Unigenitus, which had long been the occasion of so many disputes among them. However, the parliament continuing firm, and the French king approving of its conduct, the ecclesiastics thought proper to submit for the present; and, in their general assembly this year, granted him a free gift of sixteen millions of li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, which he demanded of them; a greater sum than they had ever given before, even in time of war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Eng∣lish in America.</NOTE> In the beginning of this year the assembly of Massachuset's Bay in New England passed an act, prohibiting all correspondence with the French at Louisburg; and early in the spring they raised a body of troops, which was transported to Nova Scotia, to assist lieutenant-governor Laurence in driving the French from the incroachments they had made upon that province.</P>
<P>Accordingly, towards the end of May, the go∣vernor sent a large detachment of troops, under the command of lieutenant-colonel Monkton, upon this service; and three frigates and a sloop were dispatched up the bay of Fundy, under the com∣mand
<PB N="253" REF="2630"/>
of captain Rous, to give their assistance by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> sea. The troops, upon their arrival at the river Massaguash, found the passage stopt by a large number of regular forces, rebel neutrals, or Aca∣dians, and Indians, four hundred and fifty of whom were posted in a block-house, with cannon mount∣ed on their side of the river; and the rest were posted within a strong breast-work of timber, thrown up by way of outwork to the block-house. The English provincials attacked this place with such spirit, that, in an hour's time, the enemy were obliged to fly, and leave them in possession of the breast-work; whereupon the garrison in the block-house deserted it, and left the passage of the river free. From thence colonel Monkton ad∣vanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beau-se∣jour taken by colonel Monkton.</NOTE> to the French fort of Beau-sejour, which he invested, as far at least as the small number of his troops would permit, on the twelfth of June; and, after four days bombardment, he obliged it to surrender, though the French had twenty-six pieces of cannon mounted, and plenty of ammunition, and the English had not yet placed a single can∣non upon their batteries. The garrison was sent to Louisbourg, on condition of not bearing arms in America for the space of six months; and the Aca∣dians, who had joined the French, were pardoned, in consideration of their having been forced into that service.</P>
<P>Colonel Monkton, after putting a garrison into this place, and changing its name into that of Cum∣berland. the next day attacked and reduced the other French fort upon the river Gaspereau, which runs into bay Verte; where he likewise found a large quantity of provisions and stores of all kinds,
<PB N="254" REF="2640"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> that being the chief magazine for supplying the French Indians and Acadians with arms, ammuni∣tion, and other necessaries. He then disarmed these last, to the number of fifteen thousand: and, in the mean time, captain Rous with his ships sailed to the mouth of the river St. John, to attack the new fort the French had erected there; but they saved him that trouble, by abandoning it upon his appearance, after bursting their cannon, blowing up their magazine, and destroying, as far as they had time, all the works they had lately raised. The English had but twenty men killed, and about the same number wounded, in the whole of this expe∣dition, the success of which secured the tranquillity of Nova Scotia.</P>
<P>While the New Englanders were thus employed in reducing the French in Nova Scotia, prepara∣tions were made in Virginia for attacking them upon the Ohio. A fort was built, which was like∣wise called Fort Cumberland, and a camp formed, at Wills's Creek; and, on the fourteenth of Ja∣nuary<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Brad∣dock's un∣fortunate expedi∣tion.</NOTE> of this year, major-general Braddock, with colonel Dunbar's and colonel Halket's regiments of foot, sailed from Cork in Ireland for Virginia, where they all landed safe before the end of February. This general might consequently have entered up∣on action early in the spring, had he not been un∣fortunately delayed by the Virginian contractors for the army, who, when he was ready to march, had neither provided a sufficient quantity of provisions for his troops, nor a competent number of carriages for his army.</P>
<P>This accident was foreseen by almost every person who knew any thing of our plantations upon the
<PB N="255" REF="2650"/>
continent of America: for the people of Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755▪</NOTE> who think of no produce but their tobacco, and do not raise corn enough even for their own sub∣sistance, being, by the nature of their country, well provided with the conveniency of water-con∣veyance, have but few wheel-carriages, or beasts of burden; whereas Pensylvania, which abounds in corn, and most other sorts of provisions, has but little water-carriage, especially in its western settlements, where its inhabitants have great numbers of carts, waggons, and horses. Mr. Braddock should therefore certainly, in point of prudence, have landed in Pensylvania: the con∣tract for supplying his troops should have been made with some of the chief planters there, who could easily have performed their engagements; and if his camp had been formed near Frank's-town, or somewhere upon the south-west borders of that province, he would not have had eighty miles to march from thence to Fort Du Quesne, instead of an hundred and thirty miles that he had to advance from Wills's Creek, where he did encamp, through roads neither better nor more practicable than the other would have been. This error, in the very beginning of the expedition, whether ow∣ing to an injudicious preference fondly given to the Virginians in the lucrative job of supplying these troops, or to any other cause, delayed the march of the army for some weeks, during which it was in the utmost distress for necessaries of all kinds; and would probably have defeated the expedition intirely for that summer, had not the contractors found means to procure some assistance from the back-settlements of Pensylvania. But even when
<PB N="256" REF="2660"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> these supplies did arrive, they consisted of only fif∣teen waggons, and an hundred draught horses, in∣stead of an hundred and fifty waggons and three hundred horses, which the Virginian contractors had engaged to furnish, and the provisions were so bad that they could not be used. However, some gentlemen in Pensylvania, being applied to in this exigency, amply made up for these deficiencies, and the troops were by this means supplied with every thing they wanted.</P>
<P>Another, and still more fatal, error was com∣mitted in the choice of the commander for this ex∣pedition. Major-general Braddock, who was ap∣pointed to it, was undoubtedly a man of courage, and expert in all the punctilios of a review, hav∣ing been brought up in the English guards; but he was naturally very haughty, positive, and diffi∣cult of access; qualities ill suited to the temper of the people amongst whom he was to command. His extreme severity in matters of discipline had always made his soldiers dislike him; and the strict military education in which he had been trained from his youth, and which he prided himself on strictly following, made him hold the American militia in great contempt, because they could not go through their exercise with the same dexterity and regularity as a regiment of guards in Hyde-Park, little knowing, or indeed being able to form any idea of the difference between the European manner of fighting, and an American expedition through woods, deserts, and morasses. Before he left England, he received, in the hand-writing of colonel Napier, a set of instructions from the duke of Cumberland, which did honour to the military
<PB N="257" REF="2670"/>
skill of that prince. By these instructions, the at∣tempt<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> upon Niagara was, in a great measure, re∣ferred to him; and the reduction of Crown-Point was to be left chiefly to the provincial forces. But, above all, his royal highness, both verbally and in this writing, frequently cautioned him carefully to beware of an ambush or surprize. Instead of regard∣ing this sulutary caution, his conceit of his own abilities made him disdain to ask the opinion of any under his command; and the Indians, who would have been his safest guards against his danger in particular, were so disgusted by the haughtiness of his behaviour, that most of them forsook his ban∣ners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His in∣cautious march towards Fort Du Quesne.</NOTE> Under these disadvantages he began his march from Fort Cumberland on the tenth of June, at the head of about two thousand two hundred men, for the Meadows, where colonel Washington was defeated the year before. Upon his arrival there, he was informed, that the French at Fort Du Quesne, which had lately been built on the same river, near its confluence with the Monangahela, expected a reinforcement of five hundred regular troops: therefore, that he might march with the greater dispatch, he left colonel Dunbar, with eight hun∣dred men, to bring up the provisions, stores, and heavy baggage, as fast as the nature of the service would permit; and with the other twelve hundred, together with ten pieces of cannon, and the neces∣sary ammunition and provisions, he marched on with so much expedition, that he seldom took any time to reconnoitre the woods or thickets he was to pass through; as if the nearer he approached the enemy, the farther he was removed from danger.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="2680"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> On the eighth of July, he encamped within ten miles of fort Du Quesne; and though colonel Dun∣bar was then near forty miles behind him, and his officers, particularly Sir Peter Halket, earnestly in∣treated him to proceed with caution, and to em∣ploy the friendly Indians that were with him, by way of advanced guard, in case of ambuscades; yet he resumed his march the next day, without so much as endeavouring to get any intelligence of the situation or disposition of the enemy, or even sending out any scouts to visit the woods and thickets then on both sides of him, as well as in his front. With this carlessness he was advancing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He falls into an ambus∣cade.</NOTE> when, about noon, he was saluted with a general fire upon his front, and all along his left flank, from an enemy so artfully concealed behind the trees and bushes that not a man of them could be seen, and who had cunningly given the whole army time to enter the defile before they began to fire. The van-guard immediately fell back upon the main body, and in an instant the pannic and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is de∣feated.</NOTE> confusion, particularly of the regulars, became ge∣neral; so that most of them fled with great precipi∣tation, notwithstanding all that their officers, some of whom behaved very gallantly, could do to stop their career. As to Braddock himself, he discovered at once the greatest intrepidity, and the highest im∣prudence; for, instead of ordering a retreat till he could scour the thickets and bushes from whence the fire came, with grape-shot from the ten pieces of cannon he had with him, or ordering flanking par∣ties of his Indians to advance against the enemy, he obstinately continued upon the spot where he was and gave orders for the few brave officers and men who remained with him, to form regularly and
<PB N="259" REF="2690"/>
advance. While this was doing, his men fell thick<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> about him, and almost all his officers were singled out, one after another, and killed or wounded; for the Indians, who always take aim when they fire, and aim chiefly at the officers, distinguished them by their dress. At last the general, whose obstinacy seemed to increase with the danger, after having had five horses shot under him, received himself a musket-shot thro' the right arm and lungs, of which he died four days after, having been car∣ried off the field by the bravery of lieutenant colonel<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is killed.</NOTE> Gage, and another of his officers. When he drop∣ped, the confusion of the few that remained, turned into a downright and very disorderly flight, though no enemy appeared, or attempted to attack them. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage of the army were left to the enemy, and among the rest the general's cabinet, with all his letters and in∣structions, which the French court afterwards made great use of in their printed memorials or manifes∣toes. But what was very extraordinary, the pro∣vincial militia, so much despised by the general, that he made them march always in the rear, not only were less affected with the pannic, and preserved their order better than the regular troops, though the enemy's fire fell as heavy upon them as upon any of the rest, but even offered to cover the fugi∣tives: and when the latter refused to stand their ground, saying, that though they were willing to advance against an open enemy, they would not rush blindly on against brakes and bushes that were lined with unseen destruction; the former alone bravely formed, and advanced against the In∣dians: to which gallantry it was owing that the regulars were not all cut off. The loss of the Eng∣lish
<PB N="260" REF="2700"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> in this unhappy affair amounted to seven hun∣dred men. Their officers, in particular, suffered much more than in the ordinary proportion of battles in Europe. Sir Peter Halket fell by the very first fire, at the head of his regiment; and the general's secretary, son to governor Shirley, was killed soon after. Neither the number of men which the enemy had in this engagement, nor the loss which they sustained, could be so much as guessed at: but the French afterwards gave out that their number did not, in the whole, exceed four hun∣dred men, mostly Indians; and that their loss was quite inconsiderable, as it probably was, because they lay concealed in such a manner that the Eng∣lish knew not whither to point their muskets. The pannic of these last continued so long, that they never stopped till they met the rear division; and even then they infected those troops with their ter∣rors; so that the army retreated without stopping, till they reached fort Cumberland, though the ene∣my did not so much as attempt to pursue, nor ever appeared in sight, either in the battle, or after the defeat. On the whole, this was perhaps the most ex∣traordinary victory that ever was obtained, and the farthest flight that was ever made. This seems to be the clearest account that has yet been given of this unfortunate affair, which, though recent in re∣membrence, is darker and related with a greater va∣riety of circumstances than might have been expect∣ed of an event which had happened in distant ages.</P>

<P>Virginia, Maryland, and Pensylvania, were by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Desence∣less state of Virgi∣nia, Ma∣ryland, and Pen∣sylvania.</NOTE> these means left intirely to take care of themselves, which they might have done effectually, had they been united in their councils: but the usual dis∣putes, between their governors and assemblies, de∣feated every salutary plan that was proposed.</P>
<P>Pensylvania, the most powerful of the three, was readered quite impotent, either for its own defence, or that of its neighbours, by these unhappy con∣tests; though, at last, the assembly of that pro∣vince, sensible of the danger to which they were exposed, and seeing the absolute necessity of pro∣viding a standing military force, and of ercting some forts to defend their western frontier, passed a bill for raising fifty thousand pounds. But even this sum, small as it was, even to a degree of ridi∣cule, considering the riches of the province, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disagree∣ment be∣tween the governor and as∣sembly of Pensylva∣nia.</NOTE> the extent of its frontier, could not be obtained; the governor positively refusing to give his assent to the act of the assembly, because they had taxed the proprietors estate equally with those of the in∣habitants,
<PB N="262" REF="2720"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> which, he said, he was ordered by his instructions not to consent to, nor indeed to any new tax upon the proprietaries; and the assembly, consisting chiefly of members whose estates lay in the eastern or interior parts of the province, as po∣sitively refusing to alter their bill.</P>
<P>One would be apt to think, that, in a case of such urgent necessity, the governor might have ventured to give his assent to the bill, under a pro∣test, that it should not prejudice the rights of the proprietaries upon any future occasion: but as he did not, the bill was dropt, and the province left defenceless; by which it afterwards suffered se∣verely, to the destruction of many of the poor in∣habitants upon the western frontier, and to the impressing Indians with a contemptible opinion of the English, and the highest esteem of the French.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The colo∣nies to the northward more ac∣tive.</NOTE> Our colonies to the north of Pensylvania were more active, and more successful in their prepara∣tions for war. New York, following the example of New England, passed an act to prohibit the sending of provisions to any French port or settle∣ment on the continent of North America, or any of the adjacent islands; and also for raising forty-five thousand pounds, on estates real and personal, for the better defence of their colony, which lay more exposed than any other to a French invasion from Crown Point. However, this sum, great as it might seem to them, was far from being sufficient; nor indeed could they have provided properly for their security, without the assistance of our other colonies to the east of them: but with their help, and the additional succour of the small body of regular troops expected to arrive there under
<PB N="263" REF="2730"/>
colonel Dunbar, they boldly resolved upon offen∣sive<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> measures, which, when practicable, are always best for defence; and two expeditions, one against<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ex∣pedition against Crown-Point and Niagara resolved on.</NOTE> the French fort at Crown▪Point, and the other against their fort at Niagara, between the lakes Ontario and Erie, were set on foot at the same time.</P>
<P>The former of these expeditions was appointed to be executed under the command of colonel, now general Johnson, a native of Ireland, who had long resided upon the Mohock river, in the western parts of New York, where he had acquired a considerable estate, and was universally beloved, not only by the inhabitants, but also by the neighbouring Indians, whose language he had learnt, and whose affections he had gained by his humanity towards them. The expedition against Niagara was commanded by ge∣neral Shirley himself.</P>
<P>The rendezvous of the troops for both these ex∣peditions was appointed to be at Albany, where most of them arrived before the end of June: but the artillery, battoes, provisions, and other necessa∣ries for the attempt upon Crown-Point, could not be prepared until the eighth of August, when general Johnson set out with them from Albany for the Carrying-place, from Hudson's river to lake George, where the troops had already arrived, under the command of major-general Lyman, and consisted of between five and six thousand men, besides Indians, raised by the governments of Bos∣ton, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York. Every thing was then prepared as fast as possible for a march; and towards the end of the month general Johnson advanced about
<PB N="264" REF="2740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> fourteen miles forward with his troops, and en∣camped in a very strong situation, covered on each<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Johnson encamps at lake George.</NOTE> side by a thick wooded swamp, by Lake George in his rear, and by a breast-work of trees, cut down for that purpose, in his front. Here he resolved to wait the arrival of his battoes, and afterwards to proceed to Ticonderoga, at the other end of the lake, from whence it was but about fifteen miles to the fort at the south end of Lake Corlaer, or Champlain, called Fort Frederic by the French, and by us Crown-Point. Whilst he was thus en∣camped, some of his Indian scouts▪ of which he took care to send out numbers along both sides, and to the farther end of Lake George, brought him intelligence that a considerable number of the enemy were then on their march from Ticonde∣roga, by the way of the south Bay, towards the fortified encampment, since called Fort Edward, which general Lyman had built at the Carrying-place, and in which four or five hundred of the New Hampshite and New York men had been left as a garrison. Upon this information general Johnson sent out two expresses, one after the other, to colonel Blanchard, their commander, with orders to call in all his out-parties, and to keep his whole force within the intrenchmetts. About twelve o'clock at night, those who had been sent upon the second express returned, with an account of their having seen the enemy within four miles of the camp at the Carrying-place, which they scarcely doubted their having by that time attacked. Im∣portant as the defence of this place was for the safety of the whole army, and imminent as the danger seemed to be, it does not appear that the
<PB N="265" REF="2750"/>
general then called any council of war, or resolved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> upon any thing for its relief: but early the next morning he called a council, wherein it was unad∣visedly resolved to detach a thousand men, with a number of Indians, to intercept, or, as the general's expression is in his letter, to catch the enemy in their retreat, either as victors, or as defeated in their design; and this expedient was resolved on, tho' no one knew the number of the enemy, nor could ob∣tain any information in that respect from the Indian scouts, because the Indians have no words or signs for expressing any large number, which, when it exceeds their reckoning, they signify by pointing to the stars in the firmament, or to the hair of the head; and this they often do to denote a number less than a thousand, as well as to signify ten thou∣sand, or any greater number.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he is attack∣ed by the French</NOTE> The resolution of the council being unanimous∣ly agreed to, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning a thousand men, with upwards of two hundred Indians, were detached under the com∣mand of colonel Williams: but they had not been gone two hours when those in the camp begun to hear a close firing, at about three or four miles dis∣tance, as they judged: as it approached nearer and nearer, they rightly supposed that their detach∣ment was overpowered, and retreating towards the camp; which was soon confirmed by some fugi∣tives, and presently after by whole companies, who fled back in great confusion. In a very short time after, the enemy appeared marching in a regular order up to the center of the camp, where the con∣sternation was so great, that, if they had attacked the breast-work directly, they might probably have
<PB N="266" REF="2760"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> thrown all into confusion, and obtained an easy victory: but, fortunately for the English, they halted for some time at about an hundred and fifty yards distance, and from thence began their attack with platoon firing, too far off to do much hurt, especially against troops who were defended by a strong breast work. On the contrary, this ineffec∣tual fire served only to raise the spirits of these last, who, having prepared their artillery during the time that the French halted, began to play it so briskly upon the enemy, that the Canadians and Indians in their service fled immediately into the woods on each side of the camp, and there squatted behind bushes, or sculked behind trees, from whence they continued firing with very little execution, most of their shot being intercepted by the brakes and thickets; for they never had the courage to advance to the verge of the wood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who are intirely defeated.</NOTE> Baron Dieskau, who commanded the French, being thus left alone, with his regular troops, at the front of the camp, finding he could not make a close attack upon the center with his small number of men, moved first to the left, and then to the right, at both which places he endeavoured to force a passage; but was repulsed, as being unsup∣ported by the irregulars. Instead of retreating, as he ought in prudence to have done, he still continued his platoon and bush firing till four o'clock in the afternoon, during which time his regular troops suffered greatly by the fire from the camp, and were at last thrown into confusion; which was no sooner perceived by general John∣son's men, than they, without waiting for orders, jumped over their breast-work, attacked the enemy
<PB N="267" REF="2770"/>
on all sides, and, after killing or taking a consider∣able<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> number of them, intirely dispersed the rest.</P>
<P>The French, whose numbers, at the beginning of this engagement, amounted to about two thou∣sand men, including two hundred grenadiers, eight hundred Canadians, and the rest Indians of different nations, had between seven and eight hundred men killed, and thirty taken prisoners: among these last was baron Dieskau himself, who was found at a little distance from the field of battle dangerously wounded, and leaning on the stump of a tree for his support. The English lost about two hundred men, and those chiefly of the detachment under colonel Williams; for they had very few either killed or wounded in the attack upon their camp, and not any of distinction, except colonel Titcomb killed, and the general himself and major Nichols wounded. Among the slain of the detachment, which would probably have been almost intirely cut off, had not lieutenant▪colonel Cole been sent out from the camp with three hun∣dred men, with which he stopt the enemy's pursuit, and covered the retreat of his friends, were colonel Williams, major Ashley, six captains, and several subalterns, besides private men; and the Indians reckoned that they had lost forty men, besides the brave old Hendrick, the Mohock Sachem, or chief captain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors of the com∣manders on both sides.</NOTE> When baron Dieskau set out from Ticonderoga, his design was only to surprise and cut off the in∣trenched camp, now called Fort Edward, at the Carrying place, where there were but four or five hundred men. If he had executed this scheme, our army would have been thrown into great difficulties;
<PB N="268" REF="2780"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> for it could neither have proceeded farther, nor have subsisted where it was, and he might have found an opportunity to attack it with great advan∣tage in its retreat. But when he was within four or five miles of that fort, his people were informed that there were several cannon there, and none at the camp; upon which they all desired to be led on to this last, which he the more readily consented to, as he himself had been told by an English pri∣soner, who had left this camp but a few days be∣fore, that it was quite defenceless, being without any lines, and destitute of cannon; which, in effect, was true at that time; for the cannon did not ar∣rive, nor was the breast-work erected, till about two days before the engagement. To this misin∣formation, therefore, must be imputed this step, which would otherwise be inconsistent with the ge∣nerally allowed character and abilities of baron Dieskau. A less justifiable error seems to have been committed by general Johnson, in not de∣taching a party to pursue the enemy when they were defeated and fled. Perhaps he was pre∣vented from so doing by the ill fate of the detach∣ment he had sent out in the morning under colonel Williams. However that may be, his neglect, in this respect, had like to have been fatal the next day to a detachment sent from Fort Edward, con∣sisting of an hundred and twenty men of the New Hampshire regiment under captain M`Ginnes, as a reinforcement to the army at the camp. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bravery of captain M`Gin∣nes.</NOTE> party fell in with between three and four hun∣dred men of Dieskau's troops, near the spot where colonel Williams had been defeated the day before: but M`Ginnes, having timely notice by
<PB N="269" REF="2790"/>
his scouts of the approach of an enemy, made such<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> a disposition, that he not only repulsed the as∣sailants, but defeated and intirely dispersed them, with the loss only of two men killed, eleven wounded, and five missing. He himself unfortu∣nately died of the wounds he received in this en∣gagement, a few days after he arrived at the camp with his party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the army under general Johnson.</NOTE> It was now judged too late in the year to pro∣ceed to the attack of Crown Point, as it would have been necessary, in that case, to build a strong fort in the place where the camp then was, in order to secure a communication with Albany, from whence only the troops could expect to be rein∣forced, or supplied with fresh stores of ammunition or provisions. They therefore set out upon their return soon after this engagement, having first erected a little stockaded fort, at the hither end of Lake George, in which they left a small garrison, as a future prey for the enemy; a misfortune which might easily have been foreseen, because this whole army, being country militia, was to be disbanded, and return to their respective homes, as they ac∣tually did, soon after their retreat to Albany.</P>
<P>This was all the glory, this all the advantage, that the English nation acquired by such an expen∣sive expedition. But so little had the English been accustomed of late to hear of victory, that they re∣joiced at this advantage, as if it had been an ac∣tion of the greatest consequence. The general was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rewards bestowed upon him by the king and parlia∣ment.</NOTE> highly applauded for his conduct, and liberally re∣warded; for he was created a baronet by his ma∣jesty, and presented with five thousand pounds by the parliament.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descrip∣tion of Fort Os∣wego.</NOTE> Oswego lies on the south-east side of the lake Ontario, near three hundred miles almost due-west from Albany in New York. The way to it from thence, though long and tedious, is the more con∣venient, as the far greatest part of it admits of water-carriage, by what the inhabitants call bat∣toes, which is a kind of light flat-bottomed boat, widest in the middle, and pointed at each end, of about fifteen hundred weight burden, and ma∣naged by two men, called battoe-men, with pad∣dles and setting-poles, the rivers being in many places too narrow to admit of oars. From Albany to the village of Shenectady, whch is sixteen miles, is a good waggon-road. From thence to the little Falls in the Mohock river, being sixty-five miles, the passage is by water-carriage up that river, and consequently against the stream, which in many places is somewhat rapid, and in others so shallow, that, when the river is low, the watermen are obliged to get out, and draw their battoes over the rifts. At the little Falls is a postage, or land-carriage, for about a mile, over a ground so marshy, that it will not bear any wheel-carriage: but a colony of Germans, settled there, attend with sledges, on which they draw the loaded battoes to the next place of embarkation upon the same river.
<PB N="271" REF="2810"/>
From thence they proceed by water up that river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> for fifty miles, to the Carrying-place, near the head of it, where there is another postage, the length of which depends upon the dryness or wetness of the season, but is generally above six or eight miles over in the summer months. Here the battoes are again carried upon sledges, till they come to a nar∣row river called Wood's Creek, down which they are wafted on a gentle stream, for about forty miles, into the lake Oneyada, which stretches from east to west about thirty miles, and is passed with great ease and safety in calm weather. At the western end of this lake is the river Onondaga, which after a course of between twenty and thirty miles, unites with the river Cayuga, or Seneca, and their united stream runs into the lake Ontario, at the place where Oswego-fort is situated. But this river is so rapid as to be sometimes dangerous, besides its being full of rifts and rocks; and about twelve miles on this side of Oswego there is a fall of eleven feet perpendicular, where there is conse∣quently a postage, which, however, does not ex∣ceed forty yards. From thence the passage is easy quite to Oswego.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and of the lake Ontario.</NOTE> The lake Ontario, on which this fort stands, is near two hundred and eighty leagues in circum∣ference: its figure is oval, and its depth runs from twenty to twenty-five fathoms. On the north side of it are several little gulphs. There is a commu∣nication between this lake and that of the Hurons by the river Tanasuate, from whence it is a land-carriage of six or eight leagues to the river To∣ronto, which falls into it. The French have two forts of consequence on this lake; Frontignac,
<PB N="272" REF="2820"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> which commands the river St. Laurence, where the lake communicates with it; and Niagara, which commands the communication between the lake Ontario and the lake Erie. But of these forts, and this last lake, which is one of the finest in the world, we shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Neglect of the English in not forti∣fying it.</NOTE> Though we had long been in possession of fort Oswego, and though it lay greatly exposed to the French, particularly those of Canada, upon any rupture between the two nations, we had never taken care to render it tolerably defensible, or even to build a single vessel fit for navigating the lake: nor was this strange neglect ever taken effectual notice of, till the beginning of this year, when, at a meeting which general Braddock had in April with the governors and chief gentlemen of several of our colonies, at Alexandria in Virginia, it was resolved to strengthen both the fort and garrison at Oswego, and to build some large vessels at that place. Accordingly, a number of shipwrights and workmen were sent thither in May and June. At the same time captain Bradstreet marched thither, with two companies of an hundred men each, to reinforce the hundred that were there before under captain King, to which number the garrison had been in∣creased since our contests with France began to grow serious. For a long time before, not above twenty-five men were left to defend this post, which, from its great importance, and the situation of af∣fairs at this juncture, most certainly required a much stronger garrison than was put into it even at this juncture: but oeconomy was the chief thing con∣sulted in the beginning of this war, and to that, in a great measure, has been owing its long duration.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="2830"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> From the above description of the passage from Albany to Oswego, it is plain how necessary it was that the troops intended for this expedition should<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slowness of the pre∣parations for the expediti∣on against Niagara.</NOTE> have set out early in the spring. But, instead of that, the very first of them, colonel Schuyler's New Jersey regiment, did not begin their march till after the beginning of July! and just as Shirley's and Pepperell's regiments were preparing to follow, the melancholy account of Braddock's disaster arrived at Albany, where it so damped the spirits of the people, and spread such a terror, that many of the troops deserted, and most of the battoe-men dis∣persed and run home, by which means even all the necessary stores could not be carried along with the troops. Notwithstanding this disappoint∣ment, general Shirley set out from Albany be∣fore the end of July, with as many of the troops and stores as he could procure a conveyance for, hoping to be joined in his route by great numbers of the Indians of the Six Nations, to whom he sent invitations to that effect as he passed by their settlements: but they, instead of complying with his desire, absolutely declared against all hostilities on that side of the country; and insisted, that Os∣wego, being a place of traffic and peace, ought not to be disturbed either by the English or the French, as if they could have persuaded both parties to agree to such a local truce. Upon this refusal, Mr. Shirley proceeded forward, being joined by very few Indians, and arrived at Oswego on the seventeenth or eighteenth of August; but the rest of the troops and artillery did not arrive till the last day of that month; and, even then, their store of provisions was not sufficient to enable
<PB N="274" REF="2840"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> them to proceed against Niagara▪ though some tolerable good vessels had by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time been built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> ready for that purpose.</P>
<P>The general now resolved to take but six hun∣dred men with him for the attack of Niagara, and to leave the rest of his army, consisting of about fourteen hundred more, at Oswego, to defend that place, in case the French should attack it in his ab∣sence, which there was reason to apprehend they might, as they had then a considerable force at Fort Frontignac, from whence they could easily cross over the lake Ontario to Oswego. However, he was still obliged to wait at Oswego for provi∣sions, of which at length a small supply arrived on the twenty-sixth of September, barely sufficient to support his men during their intended expedition, and to allow twelve days short subsistence for those he left behind. But by this time the rainy boiste∣rous season had begun, on which account most of his Indians had already left him, and were returned home; and the few that remained with him de∣clared, that there was no crossing the lake Ontario in battoes at that season, or any time before the next summer. In this perplexity he called a coun∣cil of war, which, after weighing all circumstances, unanimously resolved to defer the attempt upon Niagara till the next year, and to employ the troops, whilst they remained at Oswego, in build∣ing barracks, and erecting, or at least beginning to erect, two new forts, one on the east side of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two new forts be∣gun on the river Ononda∣ga.</NOTE> river Onondaga, four hundred and fifty yards dis∣tant from the old fort, which it was to command as well as the entrance of the harbour, and to be called Ontario-fort; and the other four hun∣dred

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">End of this year's campaign in Ameri∣ca.</NOTE> Thus ended this year's unfortunate campaign, at least on the side of the English; for the French, with the assistance of their Indian allies, continued their murders, scalping, captivating, and laying waste the western frontiers of Virginia and Pensylvania, during the whole winter. Of these horrid ravages many dismal accounts have been published in our news-papers, full of the most shocking barbarity on one side, and without any opposition on the other: but as a particular recital of them would lead us into a detail too minute for a general history, we shall pass over those private calamities, and re∣turn to the public affairs of Europe.</P>
<P>The ministers of the two jarring powers were very busily employed this year at most of the courts of Europe; but their transactions were kept extremely secret. The French endeavoured to in∣spire
<PB N="276" REF="2860"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the Spaniards with a jealousy of the strength<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruitless intrigues of the French in Spain.</NOTE> of the English by sea, especially in America; and the Spanish court seemed inclined to accept of the office of mediator: but Mr. Wall, who was per∣fectly acquainted with the state of affairs be∣tween England and France, seconded the represen∣tations of the British ministry, which demonstrated, that however willing Great Britain might be to accept of the mediation of Spain, she could not agree to any suspension of arms in America, which France insisted on as a preliminary condition, with∣out hazarding the whole of her interest there; and that the captures which had been made by the English were the necessary consequence of the in∣croachments and injustice of the French, particu∣larly in that country. Upon this, all farther talk of the mediation of Spain was dropt, and the mi∣nistry of Versailles had recourse to the princes of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their practices in Ger∣many.</NOTE> Germany; amongst whom the elector of Cologne was soon brought over to their party, so as to consent to their forming magazines in his territo∣ries in Westphalia. This was a plain indication of their design against Hanover, which they soon after made his Britannic majesty, who was then at Hanover, an offer of sparing, if he would engage that affairs should be adjusted to their satisfaction in America: but this proposal being rejected with disdain, the count D'Aubeterre, envoy extraordi∣nary from France at the court of Vienna, pro∣posed a secret negotiation with the ministers of the Empress-queen; and gave broad intimations, that if she would enter into the views of his most Christian majesty, she might command all that was in his power against the king of Prussia. The se∣cret
<PB N="277" REF="2870"/>
articles of the treaty of Petersburgh, be∣tween<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the two Empresses, had stipulated a kind of partition of the Prussian territories; but his Britannic majesty, though often invited, had al∣ways refused to agree to any such stipulation; and the King of Poland, though much inclined to favour the scheme, did not dare to avow it formally, till matters should be more ripe for carrying it into execution. The court of Vienna, whose favourite measure this was, began to listen to D'Aubeterre's insinuations, and, by degrees, entered into nego∣tiations with him, which, in the end, were pro∣ductive of that unnatural confederacy between the Empress-queen and the king of France; of which farther notice will be taken in the occurrences of the next year, when the treaty between them, into which they afterwards found means secretly to bring the empress of Russia, was concluded at Ver∣sailles.</P>
<P>As it could not be doubted, even at the time of his Britannic majesty's setting out for his German dominions, that the French would endeavour to invade Hanover, in case of a war between England and them, which seemed not only unavoidable, but near at hand; it was natural, that his majesty should endeavour to defend his possessions by the most powerful alliances he could form on the continent. To this end, during his stay at Hano∣ver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of the king of Great Britain with the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.</NOTE> he concluded, on the eighteenth of June, a treaty with the landgrave of Hesse Cassel, by which his serene highness engaged to hold in readiness, during four years, for his majesty's service, a body of eight thousand men, to be employed, if re∣quired, upon the continent, or in Britain or Ire∣land;
<PB N="278" REF="2880"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> but not on board the fleet, or beyond the seas: and also, if his Britannic majesty should judge it necessary or advantageous for his service, to fur∣nish and join to this body of eight thousand men, within six months after they should be demanded, four thousand more, of which seven hundred were to be horse or dragoons, and each regiment of in∣fantry to have two field-pieces of cannon. The king, on his side, promised to pay to the landgrave, for these succours, eighty crowns banco, by way of levy-money, for every trooper or dragoon duly armed and mounted, and thirty crowns banco for every foot-soldier; the crown to be reckoned at fifty-three sols of Holland, or at four shillings and nine pence three farthings English money: and also to pay to his serene highness, for the eight thousand men, an annual subsidy of an hundred and fifty thousand crowns banco, during the four years, to commence from the day of signing the treaty; which subsidy was to be increased to three hundred thousand crowns yearly, from the time of requiring the troops, to the time of their entering into British pay; and in case of their being dis∣missed, the said subsidy of three hundred thousand crowns was then to revive, and be continued during the residue of the term: but if twelve thou∣sand men were demanded and furnished, the sub∣sidy was then to be increased in proportion: and in case the king of Great Britain should at any time think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to send back these troops, before the ex∣piration of the treaty, notice thereof was to be given to his serene highness three months before-hand; one month's pay was to be allowed them
<PB N="279" REF="2890"/>
for their return, and they were to be furnished<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> gratis with the necessary transport-vessels.</P>
<P>Another treaty was begun with Russia about the same time; but this did not take effect during his majesty's residence at Hanover: that others were not concluded was the most surprising, as our sub∣sidy treaty with Saxony had then expired, and that with Bavaria was near expiring; and as the se∣curing of these two princes in our interest was at least as necessary towards forming a sufficient con∣federacy upon the continent for the defence of Hanover, as it was to secure the landgrave of Hesse Cassel. If the reason of their not being engaged, and no other seems so probable, was, that they re∣fused to renew their treaties with England upon any terms, all that can be said is, that they were guilty of flagrant ingratitude, as they had both received a subsidy from this kingdom for many years in time of peace, when they neither were nor could be of any service to the interest of Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The news of the Al∣cide and the Lys being taken reaches England.</NOTE> On the fifteenth of July an express arrived from admiral Boscawen, with an account of his having taken the two French ships of war, the Alcide and the Lys. This was certainly contrary to the ex∣pectation of the court of France; for, had they apprehended any such attack, they would not have ordered Mr. M'Namara to return to Brest with the chief part of their squadron; nor was it, perhaps, less contrary to the expectation of some of our own ministry: but as matters had been carried so far, it was then too late to retreat; and therefore or∣ders were soon after given to all our ships of war to make reprisals upon the French, by taking their ships wherever they should meet them. Sir Ed∣ward

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> Hawke sailed from Portsmouth on the twen∣ty-first of July, with eighteen men of war, to watch the return of the French fleet from America, which however escaped him, and got into Brest on the third day of September. Commodore Frankland sailed from Spithead for the West Indies on the thirteenth of August, with four men of war, fur∣nished with orders to commit hostilities, as well as to protect our trade and sugar-islands from any in∣sult that the French might offer; and the duke de Mirepoix, their ambassador at the court of Lon∣don, set out for Paris on the twenty-second of July, without taking leave.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the king to Eng∣land.</NOTE> A war being thus in some measure begun, his majesty thought proper, perhaps for that reason, to return to his British dominions sooner than usual; for he left Hanover on the eight of September, and arrived on the fifteenth at Kensington, where the treaty of alliance between him and the empress of Russia, which he had begun during his absence, was concluded on the thirtieth of the same month.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His treaty with Rus∣sia.</NOTE> By this treaty her Russian majesty engaged to hold in readiness in Livonia, upon the frontiers of Lithuania, a body of troops consisting of forty thousand infantry, with the necessary artillery, and fifteen thousand cavalry; and also, on the coasts of the said province, forty or fifty galleys, with the necessary crews; to be ready to act, upon the first order, in his majesty's service, in case, said the fifth article, which was the most remarkable, that the dominions of his Britannic majesty in Germany should be invaded on account of the interests or disputes which regard his kingdoms; her Imperial majesty declaring, that she would look upon such
<PB N="281" REF="2910"/>
an invasion as a case of the alliance of the year<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> one thousand seven hundred and forty-two; and that the said dominions should be therein com∣prised in this respect: but neither these troops nor gallies were to be put in motion, unless his Britan∣nic majesty, or his allies, should be somewhere at∣tacked; in which case the Russian general should march, as soon as possible after requisition, to make a diversion with thirty thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry; and should embark on board the gallies the other ten thousand infantry, to make a descent according to the exigency of the affair. On the other side, his Britannic majesty en∣gaged to pay to her Russian majesty an annual sub∣sidy of an hundred thousand pounds sterling a year, each year to be paid in advance, and to be reck∣oned from the day of the exchange of the ratifica∣tions, to the day that these troops should upon re∣quisition go out of Russia; from which day the annual subsidy to her Imperial majesty was to be five hundred thousand pounds sterling, to be paid always four months in advance, until the troops should return into the Russian dominions, and for three months after their return. His Britannic majesty, who was to be at liberty to send once every year into the said province of Livonia a commissary, to see and examine the number and condition of the said troops, further engaged, that, in case her Russian majesty should be disturbed in this diversion, or attacked herself, he would furnish immediately the succour stipulated in the treaty of one thousand seven hundred and forty-two; and that, in case a war should break out, he would send
<PB N="282" REF="2920"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> into the Baltic a squadron of his ships, of a force suitable to the circumstances.</P>
<P>This was the chief substance of the treaty, which, by agreement of both parties, was to sub∣sist for four years from the exchange of the ratifica∣tions: but in the seventh article these words were unluckily inserted: "Considering also the proximi∣ty of the countries wherein the diversion in ques∣tion will probably be made, and the facility her troops will probably have of subsisting immediately in an enemy's country, she takes upon herself alone, during such a diversion, the subsistence and treatment of the said troops by sea and land." And in the eleventh article it was stipulated, that all the plunder the Russian army should take from the enemy should belong to them.</P>
<P>That his Britannic majesty, who now knew enough of the court of Vienna to be sensible that he could expect no assistance from thence, in case his German dominions were invaded, should enter into this convention with the empress of Russia, in order to strengthen his defence upon the continent, was extremely natural; especially as he had lately lived in great friendship with her, and her transac∣tions with the court of France had been so secret, by passing through only that of Vienna, that he had not yet been informed of them; neither had the project of the treaty of Versailles then come to his knowledge, or to that of the king of Prussia, nor had either of these princes yet made any formal ad∣vances to the other.</P>
<P>The first intimation that appeared publicly of the negotiations of France with the empress of Germa∣ny, was, when the French minister, count d'Aube∣terre,
<PB N="283" REF="2930"/>
declared at Vienna, "That the warlike de∣signs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> with which the king his master was charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declara∣tion of the French minister at the court of Vienna.</NOTE> were sufficiently confuted by his great moderation, of which all Europe had manifold proofs; that his majesty was persuaded this groundless charge had given as much indignation to their Imperial Ma∣jesties as to himself: that he was firmly resolved to preserve to Christendom that tranquillity which it enjoyed through his fidelity, in religiously observ∣ing the treaty of Aix la-Chapelle: but that if his Britannic majesty's allies took part in the war which was kindled in America, by furnishing succours to the English, his majesty would be authorised to consider and treat them as principals in it." France likewise made the same declaration to other courts.</P>
<P>It must, however, be confessed, that the words and stipulation in the above recited clause, in the seventh article of the treaty of Great Britain with Russia, could not but be looked upon as a menace levelled at the king of Prussia, who, having some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirited declara∣tion of the king of Prussia, in conse∣quence of our treaty with Rus∣sia.</NOTE> time after found means to procure a copy of this treaty, and seeing it in that light, boldly declared, by his ministers at all the courts of Europe, that he would oppose with his utmost force the entrance of any foreign troops into the empire, under any pretence whatever. This declaration was particu∣larly displeasing to the French, who had already marched large bodies of troops towards the fron∣tiers of the empire, and erected several great ma∣gazines in Westphalia, with the permission of the elector of Cologne, for which our minister at his court was, in August, ordered to withdraw from thence without taking leave. However, as soon
<PB N="284" REF="2940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> as this declaration of the king of Prussia was noti∣fied to the court of Versailles, they sent an ambas∣sador extraordinary, the duke de Nivernois, to Berlin, to try to pursuade his majesty to retract his declaration, and enter into a new alliance with them. His Prussian majesty received this ambassa∣dor in such a manner, as seemed to denote a dispo∣sition to agree to every thing he had to propose. This awakened in England a jealousy that his decla∣ration alone was not to be relied on, but that it was necessary to bring him under some more solemn engagement; especially as the French had by this time a numerous army near the Lower Rhine, with magazines provided for their march all the way to Hanover; and if the king of Prussia suffered them to pass through his dominions, that electorate must be swallowed up before the Russian auxili∣aries could possibly be brought thither, or any army be formed for protecting it. For this reason<NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty between England and Prus∣sia begun.</NOTE> a negotiation was set on foot by Great Britain at Ber∣lin; but as it was not concluded before the beginning of the next year, we shall defer entering into the par∣ticulars of it, till we come to that period.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French make an∣other un∣successful attempt upon the court of Spain.</NOTE> Mean while the French made another at∣tempt upon the court of Madrid, loudly complain∣ing of the taking of their two men of war by Bos∣cawen's squadron, before any declaration of war was made, representing it as a most unjustifiable proceeding, which threatened a dissolution of all faith amongst nations. This produced a strong memorial from Sir Benjamin Keene, our minister at that court, importing, "That it was well known that the French fleet carried troops, ammunition, and every thing necessary for defending the coun∣tries
<PB N="285" REF="2950"/>
which the French had unjustly usurped in Ame∣rica,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755▪</NOTE> and of which the English claimed the proper∣ty. That the rules of self-defence authorise every nation to render fruitless any attempt that may tend to its prejudice: that this right had been made use of only in taking the two French ships of war; and that the distinction of place might be interpreted in favour of the English, seeing the two ships were taken on the coasts of the countries where the con∣test arose." In answer to this observation, the French minister represented the vast number of ships that had been taken in the European seas; for in fact the English ports soon began to be filled with them, in consequence of the general orders for making reprisals. But the court of Madrid was so far from being misled by any thing he could say, that it gave his Britannic majesty the strongest assurances of its friendship, and of its intention to take no part in the differences between him and France, but such as should be reconciliatory, and tending to restore the public tranquillity.</P>
<P>On the other hand, his Britannic majesty re∣quired, as king of Great Britain, the auxiliaries sti∣pulated to him by treaty from the empress queen. But these were flatly refused, under pretence that as<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Im∣perial court re∣fuses au∣xiliaries to Eng∣land.</NOTE> the contest between him and France related to Ame∣rica only, it was not a case of the alliance; though at the same time the French made no scruple of own∣ing, that they intended to make a powerful descent on Great Britain early in the spring. What is more, when, a little while after, France being employed in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ingrati∣tude of that court.</NOTE> making great preparations for a land war in Europe, the king of England required her to defend her own possessions, the Barrier in the Low Countries,
<PB N="286" REF="2960"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> with the number of men stipulated by treaty, which countries, acquired by English blood and English treasure, had been given to her on that ex∣press condition; she refused to do it, saying, that she could not spare troops for that purpose on account of her dangerous enemy the king of Prussia: and afterwards, when he was secured by his treaty with England, she urged that as a pretence for her unna∣tural alliance with France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of the French in refra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ing from open hos∣tilities.</NOTE> Though the English continued to make reprisals upon the French, not only in the seas of America, but also in those of Europe, by taking every ship they could meet with, and detaining them, their cargoes, and crews; yet the French, whether from a consciousness of their want of power by sea, or that they might have a more plausible plea to repre∣sent England as the aggressor, were so far from re∣turning these hostilities, that their fleet, which escaped Sir Edward Hawke, having, on the thirteenth of Au∣gust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They take the Bland∣ford man of war; but return it.</NOTE> taken the Blandford man of war, with go∣vernor Littleton on board, going to Carolina, they set the governor at liberty, as soon as the court was informed of the ship's being brought into Nantes; and shortly after released both the ship and crew. However, at the same time, their preparations for a land war still went on with great diligence, and their utmost arts and efforts were fruitlesly exerted to pursuade the Spaniards and Dutch to join with them against Great Britain. In England the prepa∣rations by sea became greater than ever; several new ships of war were put in commission, and many others taken into the service of the government: the expor∣tation of gunpowder was forbid: the bounties to sea∣men were continued; and the number of those that
<PB N="287" REF="2970"/>
either entered voluntarily, or were pressed, in∣creased<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> daily, as did also the captures from the French, among which was their ship the Espe∣rance, of seventy guns, taken as she was going from Rochfort to Brest to be manned. The land-forces of Great Britain were likewise ordered to be augmented; several new regiments were raised; and all half-pay officers, and the out-pensioners belonging to Chelsea hospital, were directed to send in their names, ages, and time of service, in order that such of them as were yet able to serve might be employed again, if wanted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Eng∣lish and French navies.</NOTE> The English navy, so early as in the month of September of this year, consisted of one ship of an hundred and ten guns, five of an hundred guns each, thirteen of ninety, eight of eighty, five of seventy-four, twenty-nine of seventy, four of sixty∣six, one of sixty-four, thirty-three of sixty, three of fifty-four, twenty-eight of fifty, four of forty-four, thirty-five of forty, and forty-two of twenty, four sloops of war of eighteen guns each, two of six∣teen, eleven of fourteen, thirteen of twelve, and one of ten, besides a great number of bomb∣ketches, fireships, and tenders; a force sufficient to oppose the united maritime strength of all the powers in Europe; whilst that of the French, even at the end of this year, and including the ships then upon the stocks, amounted to no more than six ships of eighty guns, twenty-one of seventy∣four, one of seventy-two▪ four of seventy, thirty-one of sixty-four, two of sixty, six of fifty, and thirty-two frigates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of the parlia∣ment.</NOTE> Such was the situation of the two kingdoms, when on the thirteenth of November the parliament
<PB N="288" REF="2980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> met, and his majesty opened the session with a speech<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ma∣jesty's speech.</NOTE> from the throne, in which he acquainted them, "That the most proper measures had been taken to protect our possessions in America, and to regain such parts thereof as had been incroached upon, or invaded; that to preserve his people from the ca∣lamities of war, as well as to prevent a general war from being lighted up in Europe, he had been always ready to accept reasonable and honourable terms of accommodation▪ but that none such had been proposed by France: that he had also confined his views and operations to hinder France from making new encroachments, or supporting those already made: to exert his people's right to a satis∣faction for hostilities committed in a time of pro∣found peace; and to disappoint such designs, as, from various appearances and preparations, there was reason to think had been formed against his king∣doms and dominions: that the king of Spain ear∣nestly wished the preservation of the public tran∣quility, and had given assurances of his intention to continue in the same pacific sentiments; that he himself had greatly increased his naval armaments, and augmented his land-forces in such a manner as might be least burthensome; and finally, that he had concluded a treaty with the empress of Russia, and another with the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, which should be laid before them."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able ad∣dresses of the lords and com∣mons.</NOTE> In answer to this speech, both houses voted most loyal addresses, but not without a warm oppo∣sition in each, to some of the particular expres∣sions; for it having been proposed in the house of lords to insert in their address the words following, viz. "That they looked upon themselves as obliged,
<PB N="289" REF="2990"/>
by the strongest ties of duty, gratitude, and ho∣nour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> to stand by and support his majesty in all such wise and necessary measures and engagements, as his majesty might have taken in vindication of the rights of his crown, or to defeat any attempts which might be made by France, in resentment for such measures; and to assist his majesty in disap∣pointing or repelling all such enterprizes as might be formed, not only against his kingdoms, but also against any other of his dominions, "though not belonging to the crown of Great Britain," in case they should be attacked on account of the part which his majesty had taken for maintaining the essential interests of his kingdoms." The insert∣ing of these words in their address was opposed by the earl Temple, and several other lords; because by the first part of them they engaged to approve of the treaties with Russia and Hesse Cassel, neither of which they had ever seen, nor could it be sup∣posed that either of them could be of any advan∣tage to this nation; and by the second part of these words it seemed to be resolved, to engage this na∣tion in a continental connection for the defence of Hanover, which it was impossible for England to support, and which would be so far from being of any advantage to it at sea, or in America, that it might at last disable the nation from defending it∣self in either of those parts of the world. But upon putting the question, the inserting of these words was agreed to by a great majority, and ac∣cordingly they stand as part of the address of the house upon that occasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His maje∣sty's an∣swer.</NOTE> To this remarkable address his majesty returned the following as remarkable answer: "My lords,
<PB N="290" REF="3000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> I give you my hearty thanks for this dutiful and affectionate address. I see, with the greatest satis∣faction, the zeal you express for my person and go∣vernment, and for the true interest of your coun∣try, which I am determined to adhere to. The assurances which you give me for the defence of my territories abroad, are a strong proof of your affection for me, and regard for my honour. No∣thing shall divert me from pursuing those measures which will effectually maintain the possessions and rights of my kingdoms, and procure reasonable and honourable terms of accommodation."</P>
<P>The address of the house of commons breathed the same spirit of zeal and gratitude, and was full of the warmest assurances of a ready support of his majesty, and of his foreign dominions, if attacked in resentment of his maintaining the rights of his crown and kingdom; and his majesty's answer to it was to the same effect as that to the house of lords. The same, or nearly the same words, re∣lating to the treaties concluded by his majesty, and to the defence of his foreign dominions, were pro∣posed to be inserted in this address, which was op∣posed by William Pitt, Esq; then paymaster of his majesty's forces; the right honourable Henry Legge, Esq; then chancellor and under-treasurer of his majesty's exchequer, and one of the commis∣sioners of the treasury; and by several other gen∣tlemen in high posts under the government, as well as by many others: but, upon putting the question, it was by a considerable majority agreed to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert the words objected to; and very soon af∣ter.

In the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> mean time, a draught came over from Russia for part of the new subsidy stipulated to that crown; but some of the ministry, who were then at the head of the finances, refused to pay it, at least till the treaty should be approved of by parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Altera∣tions in the mi∣nistry.</NOTE> Sir Thomas Robinson had not been long in pos¦session of the office of secretary of state, before it was generally perceived, that, though an honest well-meaning man, and a favourite with the king, his abilities were not equal to the functions of that post. Much less were they so at this juncture, when the nation was on the point of being engaged in a difficult and expensive war, and plunged into fo∣reign measures and connections, which would re∣quire the utmost skill of an able politician to render them palatable to the people. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, though they scarce ever agreed in any other thing, had generally united in opposing his mea∣sures; and their superior influence in the house of commons, and universally acknowledged abilities, tho' of very different kinds, had always prevailed; uncommon as it was, to see two persons who held considerable places under the government, one of them being paymaster-general, and the other se∣cretary at war, oppose, upon almost every occa∣sion, a secretary of state, who was supposed to know and speak the sentiments of his master. Sir Thomas himself soon grew sensible of his want of sufficient weight in the senate of the nation; and therefore, of his own accord, on the tenth of November, wisely and dutifully resigned the seals<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Fox made se∣cretary of state.</NOTE> of his office to his majesty, who delivered them to Mr. Fox, and appointed Sir Thomas master

Lord Bar∣rington succeeded Mr. Fox as secretary at war; and soon after Sir George Lyttelton was made chancellor of the exchequer, and a lord of the trea∣sury, in the room of Mr. Legge, who had declared himself against the new continental system. How∣ever, notwithstanding even these changes in the ministry, very warm debates arose in both houses, when the treaties of Russia and Hesse Cassel came to be considered by them: some of the members were for referring them to a committee; but this motion was over-ruled, in consideration of his ma∣jesty's having engaged in them to guard against a storm that seemed ready to break upon his electo∣ral dominions, merely on account of our quarrel<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trea∣ties with Russia and Hesse Cassel confirmed by the parlia∣ment.</NOTE> with the French.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth∣quake at Lisbon.</NOTE> While the national business was thus going on, not only the public of Great Britain, but the whole world, was thrown into the deepest consternation by a dreadful earthquake, which, on the first of November, shook all Spain and Portugal, and many other places in Europe, and laid the city of Lisbon in ruins. When the news of this great calamity first reached England, it was feared lest the conse∣quences of it might affect our public credit, con∣sidering the vast interest which the English mer∣chants had in the Portuguese trade: but, fortu∣nately, it afterwards proved inconsiderable, in com∣parison of what had been apprehended; the quar∣ter in which the English chiefly lived, and where they had their warehouses, having suffered the least of any part of the city; and most of the Eng∣lish merchants then residing there, together with their families, being at their country houses, to avoid the insults to which they might have been exposed from the Portuguese populace, during the celebration of their Auto da fe, which was kept that very day. The two first shocks of this dreadful visitation continued near a quarter of an hour, after which the water of the river Tagus rose perpendicularly above twenty feet, and sub∣sided to its natural bed in less than a minute. Great numbers of houses, of which this city then contained about thirty-six thousand, extending in length near six miles, in form of a crescent, on

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> the ascent of a hill upon the north shore of the mouth of the river Tagus, within nine miles from the ocean, were thrown down by the repeated com∣motions of the earth, together with several magni∣ficent churches, monasteries, and public buildings. But what entirely completed the ruin of this then most opulent capital of the Portuguese dominions, was a devouring conflagration, partly fortuitous or natural, but chiefly occasioned by a set of imp ous villains, who, unawed by the tremendous scene at that very instant passing before their eyes, with a wickedness scarcely to be credited, set fire even to the falling edifices in different parts of the city, to increase the general confusion, that they might have the better opportunity to rob and plunder their already desolated fellow-citizens. Out of three hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, which Lisbon was then supposed to contain, about ten thousand perished by this calamity; and the survi∣vors, deprived of their habitations, and destitute even of the necessaries of life, were forced to seek for shelter in the open fields.</P>
<P>As soon as his majesty received an account of this deplorable event, from his ambassador at the court of Madrid, he sent a message to both houses of parliament, on the twenty-eighth of November, acquainting them therewith, and desiring their con∣currence and assistance towards speedily relieving the unhappy sufferers; and the parliament there∣upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relief voted by the parlia∣ment to the Por∣tuguese.</NOTE> to the honour of British humanity, unani∣mously voted, on the eighth of December, a gift of an hundred thousand pounds for the distressed people of Portugal. A circumstance which en∣hances the merit of this action is, that though the
<PB N="295" REF="3060"/>
English themselves were, at that very time, in great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> want of grain, a considerable part of the sum was sent in corn, flour, rice, and a large quantity of beef from Ireland: supplies which came very sea∣sonably for the poor Portuguese, who were in ac∣tual want of the necessaries of life. Their king was so affected by this instance of British generosity, that, to shew his gratitude for the timely relief, he ordered Mr. Castres, the British resident at his court, to give the preference in the distribution of these supplies to the British subjects who had suffered by the earthquake: accordingly about a thirtieth part of the provisions, and two thousand pounds in mo∣ney, were set apart for that purpose; and his Portu∣guese majesty returned his thanks, in very warm terms, to the British crown and nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troops, supplies, &amp;c. voted by parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The report of an intended invasion of these kingdoms by the French increasing daily, on the twenty-second day of January the lord Barrington, as secretary at war, laid before the house an estimate for defraying the charge of ten new regiments of foot, over and above the thirty-four thousand two hundred and sixty-three land-soldiers before or∣dered to be raised; and a sum of ninety-one thou∣sand nine hundred and nineteen pounds ten shil∣lings, was voted for these additional forces: upon another estimate, presented a little after by the same lord, and founded upon the same reasons, for raising, for the farther defence of the kingdom, eleven troops of light dragoons, forty nine thousand six hundred and twenty eight pounds eleven shillings and three pence, were voted for the ensuing year; together with eighty-one thousand one hundred and seventy-eight pounds sixteen shillings, for a regiment of

Besides all these supplies, Mr. Fox, on the twenty-eighth of January, presented to the house a mes∣sage from the king, desiring them to take into consideration the faithful services of the people of New England, and of some other parts of North America; upon which an hundred and fifteen thousand pounds more were voted, and five thou∣sand as a reward to Sir William Johnson in parti∣cular.

<P>Nothing could more plainly shew either the zeal of the parliament for a vigorous prosecution of the war, or their confidence in the justice and modera∣tion of our ministry, than their agreeing to this act, which was to continue in force till the end of the next session; and which, in the hands of a wicked and enterprising administration, might have been made such an use of, as would have been in∣consistent with that security which is provided by our happy constitution for the liberty of the subject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for raising a regiment of foot in North America.</NOTE> The next object of the immediate attention of the parliament, in this session, was the raising of a new regiment of foot in North America; for which purpose the sum of eighty-one thousand one hundred and seventy-eight pounds sixteen shil∣lings, to which the estimate thereof amounted, was voted. This regiment, which was to consist
<PB N="299" REF="3100"/>
of four battalions of a thousand men each, was in∣tended<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> to be raised chiefly out of the Germans and Swiss, who, for many years past, had annually transported themselves in great numbers to the British plantations in America, whe e waste lands had been assigned them upon the frontiers of the provinces; but, very injudiciously; no care had been taken to inte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mix them with the English inha∣bitants of the place. To this circumstance it is ow∣ing, that they have continued to correspond and converse only with one another; so that very few of them, even of those who have been born there, have yet learnt to speak or understand the English tongue. However, as they are all zealous pro∣testants, and in general strong, hardy men, and ac∣customed to the climate, it was judged that a regi∣ment of good and faithful soldiers might be raised out of them, particularly proper to oppose the French: but to this end it was necessary to appoint some officers, especially subalterns, who understood military discipline, and could speak the German language; and as a sufficient number of such could not be found among the English officers, it was ne∣cessary to bring over and to grant commissions to several German and Swiss officers and engineers: but as this step, by the act of settlement, could not be taken without the authority of parliament, an act was now passed for enabling his majesty to grant commissions to a certain number of foreign pro∣testants, who had served abroad as officers, or engi∣neers, to act and rank as officers, or engineers, in America only.</P>
<P>An act was likewise passed in this session, strictly forbidding, under pain of death, any of his ma∣jesty's

<P>As it had been resolved, in the beginning of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ma∣ritime laws of England extended to Ame∣rica.</NOTE> preceding summer, to build vessels of force upon the lake Ontario, an act was now passed for ex∣tending the maritime laws of England, relating to the government of his majesty's ships and forces by sea, to such officers, seamen, and others, as should serve on board his majesty's ships or vessels employed upon the lakes, great waters, or rivers, in North America: and also, but not without op∣position to this last, for the better recruiting of his majesty's forces upon the continent of America; to which end, by a new clause now added to a former act, a recruiting officer was impowered to inlist and detain an indented servant, even though his master should reclaim him, upon paying to the master such a sum as two justices of peace within the pre∣cinct should adjudge to be a reasonable equivalent for the original purchase-money, and the remain∣ing time such servant might have to serve.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The quiet of Ireland restored.</NOTE> The intestine broils of Ireland were happily composed this year, by the prudent management of the marquis of Hartington, lord lieutenant of that kingdom.

The leading men in the parliament of Ire∣land were the first that conformed: and though the ferment continued very high for some time af∣ter, among the middling and lower ranks of people, it was at length intirely allayed by the wisdom of the lord lieutenant, and the excellent laws which he encouraged and passed for the benefit of that nation. The P—of Ireland, who had been very busy in fomenting many of the late disturb∣ances, was, by his majesty's command, struck off the list of privy counsellors; and the greatest part of those patriots, whom faction had turned out of their employments there, were reinstated with honour.</P>
<P>Among other objects of the attention of the le∣gislature of that country, ten thousand pounds were granted for making the river Nore navigable from the city of Kilkenny to the town of Innestalge; twenty thousand pounds towards carrying on an inland navigation from the city of Dublin to the river Shannon; four thousand pounds for making the river Newry navigable; a thousand pounds a year for two years, for the encouragement of Eng∣lish protestant schools; several sums, to be distri∣buted in premiums, for the encouragement of the cambrick, hempen, and flaxen manufactures; and three hundred thousand pounds to his majesty, towards supporting the several branches of the establishment, and for defraying the expences of the government for two years.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> The parliament of England, which had ad∣journed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continu∣ation of the session of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> on the twenty-third of December, met again; the house of commons on the thirteenth of January, and the lords on the nineteenth. In the mean time, that is to say, on the sixteenth of the same month, the treaty between his Britannic ma∣jesty<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Prus∣sia.</NOTE> and the king of Prussia was signed, import∣ing, That, for the defence of their common coun∣try, Germany, and in order to preserve her peace and tranquillity, which, it was f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a ed, was in dan∣ger of being disturbed, on account of the disputes in America; the two kings, for that end only, en∣tered into a convention of neutrality, by which they reciprocally bound themselves not to suffer foreign troops of any nation whatsoever to enter into Germany, or pass through it, during the trou∣bles aforesaid, and the consequences that might result from them; but to oppose the same with their utmost might, in order to secure Germany from the calamities of war, maintain her funda∣mental laws and constitutions, and preserve her peace uninterrupted. Their majesties, moreover, seized this favourable opportunity to adjust the differences that had subsisted between them, in re∣lation to the remainder of the Silesia loan due to the subjects of his Britannic majesty, and the in∣demnification claimed by the subjects of his Prus∣sian majesty for their losses by sea during the late war; so that the attachment laid on the said debt was agreed to be taken off, as soon as the ratifica∣tion of this treaty should be exchanged.</P>

A bill was accordingly prepared to that effect, much the same as that which has been since passed into a law, and presented to the house on the twelfth of March by the honourable Charles Townshend, Esq; who, to his honour, was one of the chief pro∣moters of it; and, after receiving many amend∣ments in the house of commons, it was on the tenth of May passed, and sent to the lords: but<NOTE PLACE="marg">passed by the com∣mons;</NOTE> several objections being made to it by some of the peers, and it seeming to them, as they said, that some farther amendments were still necessary, which they thought they could not in that session spare time to consider so maturely as the importance of the subject required, a negative of fifty-nine against<NOTE PLACE="marg">but reject∣ed by the lords.</NOTE> twenty-three was put upon the motion for passing the bill; though every one must have been sen∣sible not only of the propriety, but even of the absolute necessity of such a law, which was ardent∣ly desired by the whole nation.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> himself obliged, in vindication of the honour of his crown, and of the rights of his people, to de∣clare war in form against France; and that he re∣lied on the Divine Protection, and the vigorous assistance of his faithful subjects, in so just a cause. The parliament was then adjourned to the eigh∣teenth of June; from thence afterwards to the eighteenth of July, and then it was prorogued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter from M. Rouillé, to the secre∣tary of state.</NOTE> In the month of January Mr. Fox, lately ap∣pointed secretary of state, received a letter from Mr. Rouillé, minister and secretary of state for foreign affairs to the king of France, expostulating, in the name of his sovereign, upon the orders and instructions for committing hostilities, which his Britannic majesty had given to general Braddock and admiral Boscawen, in diametrical opposition to the most solemn assurances so often repeated by word of mouth, as well as in writing. He complained of the insult which had been offered to his master's flag, in attacking and taking two of his ships in the open sea, without any pre∣vious declaration of war; as also by committing depredations on the commerce of his most Chris∣tian majesty's subjects, in contempt of the law of nations, the faith of treaties, and the usages established among civilized nations. He said, the sentiments and character of his Britannic majesty gave the king his master room to expect, that, at his return to London, he would disavow the con∣duct of his admiralty; but seeing that, instead of punishing, he rather encouraged those who had been guilty of such depredations, his most Christian majesty would be deemed deficient in what he owed to his own glory, the dignity of his crown,
<PB N="305" REF="3170"/>
and the defence of his people, if he deferred any<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> longer demanding a signal reparation for the out∣rage done to the French flag, and the damage sus∣tained by his subjects. He therefore demanded immediate and full restitution of all the French ships, which, contrary to law and decorum, had been taken by the English navy, together with all the officers, soldiers, mariners, guns, stores, and merchandize. He declared, that should this resti∣tution be made, he should be willing to engage in a negotiation for what further satisfaction he might claim, and continue desirous to see the differences relating to America determined by a solid and equitable accommodation: but if, contrary to all hopes, these demands should be rejected, he would consider such a denial of justice as the most authen∣tic declaration of war, and as a formed design in the court of London to disturb the peace of Eu∣rope.</P>
<P>To this peremptory remonstrance the British secretary was directed to answer, That though the king of England would readily consent to an equit∣able and solid accommodation, he would not com∣ply with the demand of immediate and full restitu∣tion as a preliminary condition; for his majesty had taken no steps but such as were rendered just and indispensible by the hostilities which the French began in time of profound peace, and a proper regard for his own honour, the rights and posses∣sions of his crown, and the security of his king∣doms.</P>
<P>Without all doubt the late transactions had af∣forded specious arguments for both nations to im∣peach the conduct of each other. The French
<PB N="306" REF="3180"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> court, conscious of their incroachments in Nova<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two nations recrimi∣nate upon each other.</NOTE> Scotia, affected to draw a shade over these, as par∣ticulars belonging to a disputed territory, and to divert the attention to the banks of the Ohio, where Jamonville and his detachment had been attacked and massacred by the English, without the least provocation. They likewise inveighed against the capture of their ships, before any declaration of war, as flagrant acts of piracy; and some neu∣tral powers of Europe seemed to consider them in the same point of view.</P>
<P>It was certainly high time to check the insolence of the French by force of arms, and surely this might have been as effectually and expeditiously exerted under the usual sanction of a formal decla∣ration; the omission of which exposed the admi∣nistration to the censure of our neighbours, and fixed the imputation of fraud and free-booting on the beginning of the war. The ministry was said to have delayed the ceremony of denouncing war from political considerations, supposing that, should the French be provoked into the first declaration of this kind, the powers of Europe would consider his most Christian majesty as the aggressor, and Great Britain would reap all the fruits of the defen∣five alliances in which she had engaged. But nothing could be more weak and frivolous than such a conjecture; the aggressor is he who first violates the peace; and every ally will interpret the aggression according to his own interest and convenience. The administration maintained the appearance of candour in the midst of their hostilities. The merchant ships, of which a great num∣ber had been taken from the French, were not sold
<PB N="307" REF="3190"/>
and divided among the captors, according to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> practice of war; but carefully sequestered, with all their cargoes and effects, in order to be restored to the right owners, in case the disputes between the two nations should not be productive of an open rupture. In this particular, however, it was p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that a little common sense had not been blended with their honourable intention. Great part of the cargoes consisted of fish, and other perishable com∣modities, which were left to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot and putresy, and afterwards thrown overboard to prevent contagion; so that the owners and captors were equally disap∣pointed, and the value of them lost to both na∣tions.</P>
<P>The court of Versailles, while they presented re∣monstrances which they knew would prove inef∣fectual, and exclaimed against the conduct of Great Britain with all the arts of calumny and exaggera∣tion at every court in Christendom, continued ne∣vertheless to make such preparations as denoted a design to prosecute the war with uncommon vigour. They began to repair and fortify Dunkirk: orders were published, that all British subjects should quit the dominions of France: many English vessels were seized in different ports of that kingdom, and their crews sent to prison. At the same time an<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French threaten Great Bri∣tain with an inva∣sion.</NOTE> edict was issued, inviting the French subjects to equip privateers, offering a premium of forty livres for every gun, and as much for every man they should take from the enemy; and promising that, in case a peace should be speedily concluded, the king would purchase the privateers at prime cost. They employed great numbers of artificers and seamen in equipping a formidable squadr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of ships
<PB N="308" REF="3200"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> at Brest; and, assembling a strong body of land∣forces, as well as a considerable number of tran∣sports, threatened the island of Great Britain with a dangerous invasion.</P>
<P>The English people were seized with consterna∣tion: the ministry were alarmed and perplexed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisi∣tion of six thousand Dutch troops ac∣cording to treaty.</NOTE> Colonel Yorke, the British resident at the Hague, was ordered by his majesty to make a requisition of the six thousand men whom the States General are obliged by treaty to furnish, when Great Britain shall be threatened with an invasion; and in Fe∣bruary he presented a memorial for this purpose. Monsieur d'Affry, the French king's minister at the Hague, having received intimation of this de∣mand, produced a counter memorial from his master, charging the English as the aggressors, and giving the States General plainly to under∣stand, that should they grant the succours de∣manded by Great Britain, he would consider their compliance as an act of hostility against himself. The Dutch, though divided among themselves by faction, were unanimously averse to any measure that might involve them in the approaching war. Their commerce was in a great measure decayed, and their finances were too much exhausted to ad∣mit of an immediate augmentation of their forces, which for many other reasons they strove to avoid. They foresaw a great increase of trade in their ad∣hering to a punctual neutrality: they were afraid of the French by land, and jealous of the English by sea; and perhaps enjoyed the prospect of seeing these two proud and powerful nations humble and impoverish each other. Certain it is, the States General protracted their answer to Mr. Yorke's
<PB N="309" REF="3210"/>
memorial by such affected delays, that the court of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> London perceived their intention, and in order to avoid the mortification of a flat denial, the king or∣dered his resident to acquaint the princess regent, that he would not insist upon his demand. The States, thus freed from their perplexity, at length de∣livered an answer to Mr. Yorke, in which they ex∣patiated on the difficulties they were laid under, and thanked his Britannic majesty for having freed them by his declaration from that embarrassment into which they were thrown by his first demand and the counter memorial of the French minister. The real sentiments of those people, however, more plainly appeared in the previous resolution delivered to the states of Holland by the towns of Amsterdam, Dort, Haerlem, Gouda, Rotterdam, and Enckhuysen, declaring flatly that England was uncontrovertibly the aggressor in Europe, by seizing a considerable number of French vessels; that the threatened invasion of Great Britain did not affect the republic's guarantee of the protestant succession, inasmuch as it was only intended to ob∣tain reparation for the injury sustained by the sub∣jects of his most Christian majesty; finally, that the succours demanded could be of no advantage to the king of England, as it appeared by the declaration of his most Christian majesty, that their granting these succours would immediately lay them under a necessity of demanding, in their turn, assistance from Great Britain. From this way of arguing, the English may perceive what they have to expect in cases of emergency from the friendship of their nearest allies, who must always be furnished with the same excuse whenever they find it convenient
<PB N="310" REF="3220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> or necessary to their own interest. Such a conside∣ration, joined to other concurring motives, ought to induce the British legislature to withdraw its de∣pendence from all foreign connexions, and provide such a constitutional force within itself, as will be fully sufficient to baffle all the efforts of an external enemy. The apprehensions and distraction of the people at this juncture plainly evinced the expedi∣ency of such a national force: but different parties were divided in their opinions about the nature of such a provision. Some of the warmest friends of their country proposed a well-regulated militia, as an institution that would effectually answer the pur∣pose of defending a wide extended sea-coast from invasion; while on the other hand, this proposal was ridiculed and refuted as impracticable or useless by all the retainers to the court, and all the officers of the standing army. In the mean time, as the experiment could not be immediately tried, and the present juncture demanded some instant deter∣mination, recourse was had to a foreign remedy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Message from the king to the par∣liament.</NOTE> Towards the latter end of March, the king sent a written message to parliament, intimating he had received repeated advices from different per∣sons and places, that a design had been formed by the French court to invade Great Britain or Ire∣land; and the great preparations of forces, ships, artillery, and warlike stores, then notoriously mak∣ing in the ports of France opposite to the British coasts, together with the language of the French ministers in some foreign courts, left little room to doubt the reality of such a design: that his ma∣jesty had augmented his forces both by sea and land, and taken proper measures and precautions
<PB N="311" REF="3230"/>
for putting his kingdom in a posture of defence:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> that, in order further to strengthen himself, he had made a requisition of a body of Hessian troops, pur∣suant to the late treaty, to be forthwith brought over, and for that purpose ordered transports to be prepared: that he doubted not of being enabled and supported by his parliament in taking all such measures as might be conducive to an end so essen∣tial to the honour of his crown, the preservation of the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of these kingdoms. This message was no sooner received, than both houses voted, composed, and presented very warm and affectionate addresses, in which his majesty was thanked for the requisition he had made of the Hessian troops; a measure which at any other time would have been stigma∣tized with all the satire and rhetoric of the oppo∣sition.</P>
<P>Even this precaution was not thought sufficient to secure the island, and quiet the terrors of the people. In a few days Mr. Fox, the new minister, encouraged by the unanimity which had appeared so conspicuous in the motions for the late ad∣dresses, ventured to move again, in the house of commons, that another address should be presented to the king, beseeching his majesty, that for the more effectual defence of this island, and for the better security of the religion and liberties of his subjects, against the threatened attack by a foreign enemy, he would be graciously pleased to order twelve battalions of his electoral troops, together with the usual detachment of artillery, to be forth∣with brought into this kingdom. There was a considerable party in the house, to whom such a
<PB N="312" REF="3240"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> motion was odious and detestable: but, consider∣ing the critical situation of affairs, they were afraid that a direct opposition might expose them to a more odious suspicion: they therefore moved for the order of the day, and insisted on the question's being put upon that motion; but it was carried in the negative by a considerable majority, which also agreed to the other proposal. The resolution of the house was communicated to the lords, who unanimously concurred; and their joint address being presented, his majesty assured them he would immed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately comply with their request. Accord∣ingly, such expedition was used, that in the course<NOTE PLACE="marg">A body of Hanove∣rians and Hessians transport∣ed to Eng∣land.</NOTE> of the next month both Hanoverians and Hessians arrived in England, and encamped in different parts of the kingdom. As the fears of an invasion sub∣sided in the minds of the people, their antipathy to these foreign auxiliaries emerged. They were be∣held with the eyes of jealousy, suspicion, and dis∣dain. They were treated with contempt, reserve, and rigour. The ministry was execrated for hav∣ing reduced the nation to such a low circumstance of disgrace, as that they should owe their security to German mercenaries.

<P>Under the cloak of an invading armament, which engrossed the attention of the British nation, the French were actually employed in preparations for an expedition, which succeeded according to their wish.

They affirmed that the Toulon squadron consisted of twelve or fifteen ships of the line, with a great number of transports; that they were supplied with provision for two months only, consequently could not be intended for America; and that strong bodies of troops were on their march from different parts of the French dominions to Dauphiné and Provence▪ in order to be embarked. Notwith∣standing these particulars of information, which plainly pointed out Minorca as the object of their expedition; notwithstanding the extensive and im∣portant commerce carried on by the subjects of Great Britain in the Mediterranean; no care was taken to send thither a squadron of ships capable to protect the trade, and frustrate the designs of the enemy. That great province was left to a few inconsiderable ships and frigates, which could serve no other purpose than that of carrying intelligence from port to port, and enriching their com∣manders by making prize of merchant vessels.

Capt.

At length the destination of the enemy's fleet<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> being universally known, the ministry seemed to rouse from their lethargy, and, like persons sud∣denly waked, they acted with hurry and precipita∣tion. Instead of detaching a squadron that in all respects should be superior to the French fleet in the Mediterranean, and bestowing the command of it upon an officer of approved courage and activity, they allotted no more than ten ships of the line for this service, vesting the command of them in ad∣miral Byng, who had never met with any occasion to signalize his courage, and whose character was not very popular in the navy: but Mr. West, the second in command, was a gentleman universally respected for his probity, ability, and resolution. The ten ships destined for this expedition were but in very indifferent order, poorly manned, and un∣provided with either hospital or fireship. They<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral Byng sails for the Mediter∣ranean.</NOTE> sailed from Spithead on the seventh day of April, having on board, as part of their complement, a regiment of soldiers to be landed at Gibraltar, with major general Stuart, the lord Effingham, and co∣lonel Cornwallis, whose regiments were in garrison at Minorca, about forty inferior officers, and near one hundred recruits, as a reinforcement to St. Phi∣lip's fortress.</P>
<P>After all the intelligence which had been re∣ceived, one would imagine the government of England was still ignorant of the enemy's force and destination; for the instructions delivered to
<PB N="316" REF="3280"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> admiral Byng imported, that, on his arrival at Gi∣braltar, he should inquire whether any French squa∣dron had passed through the Streights; and that, being certified in the affirmative, as it was probably designed for North America, he should imme∣diately detach rear-admiral West to Louisbourg, on the island Cape Breton, with such a number of ships as, when joined with those at Halifax, would constitute a force superior to the armament of the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His arri∣val at Gi∣braltar.</NOTE> On the second day of May admiral Byng arrived at Gibraltar, where he found captain Edgecumbe with the Princess Louisa ship of war, and a sloop, who informed him, that the French armament, commanded by Mr. de la Galissoniere, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, with a great number of transports, having on board a body of fifteen thou∣sand land-forces, had sailed from Toulon on the tenth day of April, and made a descent upon the island of Minorca, from whence he (captain Edge∣cumbe) had been obliged to retire at their ap∣proach.</P>
<P>General Fowke, who commanded at Gibraltar, had received two successive orders from the secre∣tary at war, with respect to his sparing a battalion of troops, to be transported by Mr. Byng, as a re∣inforcement to Minorca; but as the two orders appeared inconsistent, or equivocal, a council of war was consulted; and the majority were of opi∣nion, that no troops should be sent from thence to Minorca, except a detachment to supply the defi∣ciency in the little squadron of captain Edge∣cumbe, who had left a good number of his seamen and mariners, under the command of captain

Scroop, to assist in the defence of Fort St. Philip's.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> These articles of intelligence the admiral dis∣patched by an express to the lords of the admiralty, and in his letter made use of some impolitic ex∣pressions, which, in all probability, it would have been well for him had he omitted. He said, if he had been so happy as to have arrived at Mahon before the French had landed, he flattered himself he should have been able to prevent their getting a footing on that island. He complained, that there were no magazines in Gibraltar for supplying the squadron with necessaries; that the careening∣wharfs, pits, and storehouses, were intirely de∣cayed, so that he should find the greatest difficulty in cleaning the ships that were foul; and this was the case with some of those he carried out from England, as well as with those which had been for some time cruising in the Mediterranean. He sig∣nified his opinion, that, even if it should be found practicable, it would be very impolitic to throw any men into St. Philip's castle, which could not be saved without a land-force sufficient to raise the siege; therefore a small reinforcement would only add so many men to the number which must fall into the hands of the enemy. He observed, that such engineers and artillery-men in Gibraltar, as had been at Minorca, were of opinion, that it would be impossible to throw any number of men into St. Philip's, if the French had erected batteries on the two shores near the entrance of the harbour, so as to bar all passage up to the sally port of the for∣tress; and with this opinion he signified the con∣currence of his own sentiments.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="3300"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> The first part of this letter was a downright im∣peachment of the ministry, for having delayed the expedition, for having sent out ships unfit for ser∣vice, and for having neglected the magazines and wharfs at Gibraltar. In the latter part he seemed to prepare them for the subsequent account of his misconduct and miscarriage. It cannot be sup∣posed▪ that they underwent this accusation without apprehension and resentment; and as they foresaw the loss of Minorca, which would not fail to excite a national clamour, perhaps they now began to take measures for gratifying their resentment, and transferring the blame from themselves to the per∣son who had presumed to hint a di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> probation of their conduct: for this purpose they could not have found a fairer opportunity than Mr. Byng's subse∣quent behaviour afforded.</P>
<P>This admiral, being strengthened by Mr. Edge∣cumbe, and reinforced by a detachment from the garrison, set sail from Gibraltar on the eighth day of May, and was joined off Majorca by his ma∣jesty's ship the Phoenix, under the command of captain Hervey, who confirmed the intelligence he had already received, touching the strength and destination of the French squadron. When he ap∣proached Minorca, he descried the British colours still flying at the castle of St. Philip's, and several bomb batteries playing upon it from different quarters, where the French banners were displayed. Thus informed, he detached three ships a-head, with captain Hervey, ro reconnoitre the harbour's mouth, and land, if possible, a letter for general Biakeney, giving him to understand the fleet was come to his assistance. Before this attempt could
<PB N="319" REF="3310"/>
be made, the French fleet appearing to the south∣east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and the wind blowing strong off shore, he re∣called<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falls in with the French fleet off Minorca.</NOTE> the ships, and formed the line of battle. About six o'clock in the evening the enemy, to the number of seventeen ships, thirteen of which ap∣peared to be very large, advanced in order; but about seven tacked, with a view to gain the weather∣gage. Mr. Byng, in order to preserve that ad∣vantage, as well as to make sure of the land-wind in the morning, followed their example, being then about five leagues from Cape Mola.</P>
<P>At day-light the enemy could not be described; but two tartanes appearing close to the rear of the English squadron, they were immediately chaced by signal. One escaped; and the other being taken, was found to have on board two French captains, two lieutenants, and about one hundred private soldiers, part of six hundred who had been sent out in tartanes the preceding day, to reinforce the enemy's squadron. This soon re-appearing, the line of battle was formed on each side; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engage∣ment with La Galis∣sionere.</NOTE> about two o'clock admiral Byng threw out a signal to bear away two points from the wind, and en∣gage. At this time his distance from the enemy was so great, that rear-admiral West, perceiving it impossible to comply with both orders, bore away with his division seven points from the wind, and, closing down upon the enemy, attacked them with such impetuosity, that the ships which opposed him were in a little time driven out of the line. Had he been properly sustained by the van, in all probability the British fleet would have obtained a complete victory: but the other division did not bear down, and the enemy's centre keeping their
<PB N="320" REF="3320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> station, rear-admiral West could not pursue his advantage without running the risque of seeing his communication with the rest of the line intirely cut off.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the action the Intrepid, in Mr. Byng's division, was so disabled in her rigging, that she could not be managed, and drove on the ship that was next in position: a circumstance which obliged several others to throw all a▪back, in order to avoid confusion, and for some time re∣tarded the action. Certain it is, that Mr. Byng, though accommodated with a noble ship of ninety guns, made little or no use of his artillery; but kept aloof, either from an overstrained observance of discipline, or timidity. When his captain ex∣horted him to bear down upon the enemy, he very coolly replied, that he would avoid the error of admiral Matthews, who, in his engagement with the French and Spanish squadrons off Toulon, during the preceding war, had broke the line by his own precipitation, and exposed himself singly to a fire that he could not sustain. Mr. Byng, on the contrary, was determined against acting, except with the line intire; and, on pretence of rectifying the disorder which had happened among some of the ships, hesitated so long, and kept at such a wary distance, that he never was properly engaged, though he received some few shots in his hull. Mr. de la Galissionere seemed equally averse to the continuance of the battle: part of his squadron had been fairly obliged to quit the line; and tho' he was rather superior to the English in number of men and weight of metal, he did not chuse to abide the consequence of a closer fight with an enemy,
<PB N="321" REF="3330"/>
so expert in naval operations: he therefore took<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> advantage of Mr. Byng's hesitation, and edged away with an easy sail to join his van, which had been discomfited. The English admiral gave chace; but the French ships being clean, he could not come up and close them again, so they retired at their leisure. Then he put his squadron on the other tack, in order to keep the wind of the enemy; and next morning they were altogether out of sight.</P>
<P>While, with the rest of his fleet, he lay to, at the distance of ten leagues from Mahon, he de∣tached cruisers to look for some missing ships, which joined him accordingly, and made an inqui∣ry into the condition of the squadron. The num∣ber of killed amounted to forty two, including captain Andrews of the Defiance, and about one hundred and sixty▪eight were wounded. Three of the capital ships were so damaged in their masts, that they could not keep the sea, with any regard to their safety: a great number of the seamen were ill, and there was no vessel which could be con∣verted into an hospital for the sick and wounded. In this situation Mr. Byng called a council of war, at which the land officers were present. He re∣presented to them, that he was much inferior to the enemy in weight of metal and numbers of men; that they had the advantage of sending their wounded to Minorca, from whence at the same time they were refreshed and reinforced occasional∣ly; that, in his opinion, it was impracticable to relieve St. Philip's fort, and therefore they ought to make the best of their way back to Gibraltar, which might require immediate protection. They
<PB N="322" REF="3340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> unanimously concurred with his sentiments, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Byng returns to Gibraltar.</NOTE> thither he directed his course accordingly. How he came to be so well acquainted with the imprac∣ticability of relieving general Blakeney, it is not easy to determine, inasmuch as no experiment was made for that purpose. Indeed, the neglect of such a trial seems to have been the least excuseable part of his conduct; for it afterwards appeared, that the officers and soldiers belonging to the gar∣rison might have heen landed at the sally-port, without running any great risque; and a gentle∣man, then in the fort, actually passed and repassed in a boat, unhurt by any of the enemy's batteries.</P>
<P>Mr. Byng's letter to the admiralty, containing a detail of this action, is said to have arrived some days before it was made public; and when it ap∣peared was curtailed of divers expressions and whole paragraphs, which either tended to his own justifi∣cation, or implied a censure on the conduct of his superiors. Whatever use might have been made of this letter while it remained a secret to the pub∣lic, we shall not pretend to explain: but sure it is, that on the sixteenth day of June, Sir Edward Hawke and admiral Saunders sailed from Spithead to Gibraltar, to supersede the admirals Byng and West, in their commands of the Mediterranean squadron; and Mr. Byng's letter was not published till the twenty sixth day of the same month, when it produced all the effect which that gentleman's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferment of the people at home.</NOTE> bitterest enemies could have desired. The popu∣lace took fire like a train of the most hasty com∣bustibles, and broke out in such a clamour of rage and indignation against the devoted admiral, as could not have been exceeded, if he had lost the
<PB N="323" REF="3350"/>
whole navy of England, and left the coasts of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> kingdom naked to invasion. This animosity was carefully fomented and maintained by artful emis∣saries, who mingled with all public assemblies, from the drawing▪room at St. James's to the mob at Charing-cross. They expatiated upon the inso∣lence, the folly, the cowardice, and misconduct of the unhappy admiral. They even presumed to make their sovereign in some measure an instrument of their calumny▪ by suggesting that his majesty had prognosticated Byng's misbehaviour from the contents of his first letter dated at Gibraltar. They ridiculed and refuted the reasons he had given for returning to that fortress, after his scandalous ren∣counter with the French squadron; and, in order to exasperate them to the most implacable resentment, they exaggerated the terrible consequences of losing Minorca, which must now be subdued through his treachery, or want of resolution. In a word, he was devoted as the scape goat of the m—y, to whose supine negligence, ignorance, and miscon∣duct the loss of that important fortress was un∣doubtedly owing. Byng's miscarriage was thrown out like a barrel to the whale, in order to engage the attention of the people, that it might not be attracted by the real cause of the national misfor∣tune. In order to keep up the flame which had been kindled against the admiral, recourse was had to the lowest artifices. Agents were employed to vilify his person in all public places of vulgar re∣sort; and mobs were hired at different parts of the capital to hang and burn him in effigie.</P>
<P>The two officers who succeeded to his command in the Mediterranean were accompanied by the lord
<PB N="324" REF="3360"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> Tyrawley, whom his majesty had appointed to su∣persede general Fowke in the government of Gib∣raltar, that gentleman having incurred the displea∣sure of the ministry for not having understood an order which was unintelligible. By the same con∣veyance<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad∣miral su∣perseded, and sent home a prisoner.</NOTE> a letter from the secretary of the admiralty was transmitted to Mr. Byng, giving him notice that he was recalled. To this intimation he re∣plied in such a manner as denoted a consciousness of having done his duty, and a laudable desire to vindicate his own conduct. His answer contained a further account of the engagement in which he was supposed to have misbehaved, intermixed with some puerile calculations of the enemy's superiority in weight of metal, which served no other purpose than that of exposing his character still more to ri∣dicule and abuse; and he was again so impolitic as to hazard certain expressions, which added fresh fuel to the resentment of his enemies. Directions were immediately dispatched to Sir Edward Hawke that Byng should be sent home in arrest: and an order to the same purpose was lodged at every port in the kingdom: precautions, which however unne∣cessary to secure the person of a man who longed ardently to justify his character by a public trial, were yet productive of considerable effect in aug∣menting the popular odium.</P>
<P>Admiral Byng immediately embarked in the ship which had carried out his successor, and was ac∣companied by Mr. West, general Fowke, and several other officers of that garrison, who were also recalled in consequence of having subscribed to the result of the council of war, which we have mentioned above. When they arrived in Eng∣land,

Mr. West met with such a gracious reception<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> from his majesty as was thought due to his extra∣ordinary merit; but Mr. Byng was committed close prisoner in an apartment of Greenwich hospital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the siege of St. Philip's fort in Minorca.</NOTE> In the mean time the siege of St. Philip's fort in Minorca was prosecuted with unremitting vigour. The armament of Toulon, consisting of the fleet commanded by Mr. de la Galissoniere, and the troops under the duke de Richelieu, arrived on the eighteenth day of April at the port of Ciudadella, on that part of the island opposite to Mahon, or St. Philip's, and immediately began to disembark their forces.</P>
<P>Two days before they reached the island, gene∣ral Blakeney had by a packet-boat received cer∣tain intelligence of their approach, and begun to make preparations for the defence of the castle. The fort which he commanded was very extensive, surrounded with numerous redoubts, ravelings, and other outworks; and provided with subterranean galleries, mines, and traverses, cut out of the solid rock with incredible labour. Upon the whole, this was one of the best fortified places in Europe, well supplied with artillery, ammunition, and pro∣vision; and, without all doubt, might have sus∣tained the most desperate siege, had it been de∣fended by a numerous garrison, conducted by able engineers, under the eye and auspices of an active and skilful commander. All these advantages, however, did not concur on this occasion. The number of troops in Minorca did not exceed four regiments, whereas the nature of the works re∣quired at least double the number; and, even of these, above forty officers were absent. The chief
<PB N="326" REF="3390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> engineer was rendered lame by the gout, and the general himself oppressed with the infirmities of old age. The natives of the island might have been serviceable as pioneers, or day labourers; but, from their hatred to the protestant religion, they were generally averse to the English govern∣ment▪ although they had lived happily and grown wealthy under its influence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Precauti∣ons taken by gene∣ral Brake∣ney.</NOTE> The governor ordered his officers to beat up for volunteers in the adjacent town of St. Philip's; but few or none would inlist under his banners, and it seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would not venture to compel them into the service. He recalled all his advanced parties; and, in particular, a company posted at Fornelles, where a small redoubt had been raised, and five companies at Ciudadella, a post fortified with two pieces of cannon, which were now with∣drawn as soon as the enemy began to disembark their forces. At the same time Major Cunning∣ham was detached with a party to break down the bridges, and break up the roads, between that place and St Philip's; but the task of destroying the roads could not be performed in such a hurry, on account of the hard rock which runs along the surface of the ground through this whole island; nor was there time to demolish the town of St. Philip's, which stood so near the fort, that the enemy could not fail to take advantage of its neighbourhood. The streets served them for trenches, which otherwise could not have been dug through the solid rock. Here they made a lodgment close to the works; here they found convenient barra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks and quarters of refreshment, masks for their batteries, and an effectual cover for
<PB N="327" REF="3400"/>
their mortars and bombardiers. The general has<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> been blamed for leaving the town standing; but if we consider his uncertainty concerning the desti∣nation of the French armament, the odious nature of such a precaution, which could not fail to exas∣perate the inhabitants, and the impossibility of executing such a scheme after the first appearance of the enemy, he will be found excuseable, if not altogether blameless. Some houses and windmills were actually demolished, so as to clear the espla∣nade and the approaches. All the wine in the cel∣lars of St. Philip's town was destroyed, and the butts were carried into the castle, where they might serve for gabions and traverses. Five and twenty Minorquin bakers were hired, and a large number of cattle brought into the fort, for the benefit of the garrison. The ports were walled up, the posts assigned, the centinels placed, and all the different guards appointed. Commodore Edgecumbe, who then anchored in the harbour of Mahon, close un∣der the walls of the castle, sailed away with his little squadron, consisting of the Chesterfield, Prin∣cess Louisa, Portland, and Dolphin, after having left all his marines, a detachment from Gibraltar, the whole crew of the Porcupine sloop, and the greater part of the Dolphin's, as a reinforcement to the fort, under the immediate direction and command of captain Scroop of the Dolphin, who with great gallantry, offered himself for this severe duty, and bravely signalized himself during the whole siege.</P>
<P>The French admiral might have certainly blocked up this harbour in such a manner as would have prevented the escape of these ships, and divers
<PB N="328" REF="3410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> other rich merchant-vessels, which happened then to be at Mahon; but, in all probability, they pur∣posely allowed them to abandon the place, which, on any emergency, or assault, their crews and offi∣cers would have considerably reinforced.</P>
<P>The enemy were perfectly acquainted with the great extent of the works, and the weakness of the garrison; from which circumstances they derived the most sanguine hopes that the place might be suddenly taken, without the trouble of a regular siege.</P>
<P>After Mr. Edgecumbe had sailed for Gibraltar, and general Blakeney had ordered a sloop to be sunk in the channel that leads to the harbour, the French squadron made its appearance at this part of the island; but, without having attempted any thing against the fort, fell to leeward of Cape Mola. Next day they came in sight again; but soon bore away, and never afterwards, during the whole course of the siege, approached so near as to give the garrison the least disturbance.</P>
<P>On the twenty second day of April the governor sent a d ummer to the French general with a let∣ter, desiring to know his reasons for invading the island. To this an answer was returned by the duke de Richelieu, declaring he was come with in∣tent on to reduce the island under the dominion of his most Christian majesty, by way of retaliation for the conduct of his master, who had seized and detained the ships belonging to the king of France and his subjects.</P>
<P>If we may judge from the first operations of this nobleman, he was but indifferently provided with engineers: for, instead of beginning his ap∣proaches
<PB N="329" REF="3420"/>
on the side of St. Philip's town, close by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the outworks, where he might have been screened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣mence∣ment of the siege.</NOTE> from the fire of the garrison, his batteries were erected at Cape Mola, on the other side of the har∣bour, where they were more exposed, their fire much less effectual, and indeed at too great a dis∣tance to be of any service. The fire of St. Philip's was so severe, and the cannon so well served on this quarter, that in a little time the enemy thought proper to change their plan of attack, and advance on the side of St. Philip's town, which ought to have been the first object of their consideration, especially as they could find little or no earth to fill their gabions, and open their trenches in the usual form.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of May, about nine at night, they opened two bomb batteries, near the place where the wind-mills had been destroyed; and from that period an incessant fire was kept up, on both sides, from mortars and cannon, the French continuing to raise new batteries in every situation from whence they could annoy the besieged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng∣lish squa∣dron ap∣pears.</NOTE> On the seventeenth day of the month the garri∣son were transported with joy at sight of the Bri∣tish squadron, commanded by admiral Byng; and Mr. Boyd, commissary of the stores, ventured to embark in a small boat with six oars, which passed from St. Stephen's cove, a creek on the west side of the fortification, through a shower of cannon and musquetry from the enemy's post on the other side, and actually reached the open sea, his design being to join the squadron; but this being at a great distance, stretching away to the southward, and Mr. Boyd perceiving himself chaced by two
<PB N="330" REF="3430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> of the enemy's light vessels, he returned by the same route to the garrison, without having sustain∣ed the least damage. A circumstance which plainly confutes the notion of Mr. Byng, that it was impracticable to open a communication with the garrison of St. Philip's.</P>
<P>Next day the hopes of the besieged, which had prognosticated a naval victory to the British squa∣dron, a speedy relief to themselves, and no less than captivity to the assailants, were considerably damped by the appearance of the French fleet, which quietly returned to their station off the har∣bour of Mahon. That same evening they were told by a deserter, that the English fleet had been worsted in an engagement by Mr. de la Galisso∣niere; and this information was soon confirmed by a general discharge, or Feu de joie, through the whole French camp, to celebrate the victory they pretended to have obtained.</P>
<P>How little soever they had reason to boast of any advantage in the action, the retreat of the Eng∣lish squadron was undoubtedly equivalent to a vic∣tory: for had Mr. Byng acquired and maintained the superiority at sea, the French forces, which had been disembarked in Minorca, would, in all proba∣bility, have been obliged to surrender prisoners of war to his Britannic majesty. The case was now much altered in their favour: their squadron cruised about the island without molestation: and they daily received▪ by means of their transports, reinforcements of men and ammunition, as well as constant supplies of provisions.</P>
<P>The English garrison, however mortified at finding themselves thus abandoned, resolved to ac∣quit
<PB N="331" REF="3440"/>
themselves with gallantry in the defence of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> place, not without some remaining hope that the English squadron would be reinforced, and return to their relief.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they sustained and retorted the enemy's fire with undaunted resolution. They remounted cannon, the carriages of which had been disabled: they removed them occasionally to places from whence it was judged they could do the greatest execution: they repaired breaches, restored merlons, and laboured with surprising alacrity, even when they were surrounded by the numerous batteries of the foe; when their em∣brasures, and even the parapets, were demolished, and they stood exposed not only to the cannon and mortars, but also to the musquetry, which fired upon them, without ceasing, from the windows of the houses in the town of St. Philip. By this time they were invested with an army of twenty thou∣sand men, and plyed incessantly from sixty-two battering-cannon, twenty-one mortars, and four howitzers, besides the small arms: nevertheless, the loss of men within the fortress was very incon∣siderable, the garrison being mostly secured in the subterranean works, which were impenetrable to shells or shot. By the twenty-seventh day of June<NOTE PLACE="marg">General attack of the works.</NOTE> they had made a practicable breach in one of the ravelins, and damaged the other outworks to such a degree, that they determined this night to give a general assault. Accordingly, between the hours of ten and eleven, they advanced to the attack from all quarters on the land-side. At the same time a strong detachment, in armed boats, at∣tempted to force the harbour, and penetrate into
<PB N="332" REF="3450"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the creek, called St. Stephen's cove, to storm Fort Charles, and second the attack upon Fort Marlbo∣rough on the farther side of the creek, the most detached of all the outworks. The enemy ad∣vanced with great intrepidity, and their com∣mander, the duke de Richelieu, is said to have led them up to the works in person.</P>
<P>Such an assault could not but be attended with great slaughter: they were mowed down, as they approached, with grape-shot and musquetry; and several mines were sprung with great effect, so that the glacis was almost covered with the dying and the dead. Nevertheless, they persevered with un∣common resolution; and, though repulsed on every other side, at length made a lodgement in the Queen's redoubt, which had been greatly damaged by their cannon. Whether their success in this quarter was owing to the weakness of the place, or to the timidity of the defenders, certain it is, the enemy were in possession before it was known to the officers of the garrison: for lieutenant-colonel Jeffries, the second in command, who had acquit∣ted himself since the beginning of the siege with equal courage, skill, and activity, in his visitation of this post, was suddenly surrounded and taken by a file of French grenadiers, at a time when he never dreamed they had made a lodgement. Ma∣jor Cunningham, who accompanied him, met with a severer fate, though he escaped captivity: he was run through the right arm with a bayonet, and the piece being discharged at the same time, shattered the bones of his hand in such a manner, that he was maimed for life. In this shocking condition he retired behind a traverse, and was carried home
<PB N="333" REF="3460"/>
to his quarters. Thus the governor was deprived<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> of his two principal assistants, one being taken, and the other disabled.</P>
<P>The enemy having made themselves masters of Anstruther's and the Queen's redoubts, from which perhaps they might have been dislodged, had a vigorous effort been made for that purpose, before they had leisure to secure themselves, the duke de Richelieu ordered a parley to be beat, in order to obtain permission to bury the dead, and remove the wounded. This request was granted with more humanity than discretion, inasmuch as the enemy took this opportunity to throw a reinforcement of men privately into the places where the lodgements had been made, and these penetrated into the gal∣lery of the mines, which communicated with all the other outworks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gar∣rison ca∣pitulates.</NOTE> During this short cessation, general Blakeney summoned a council of war, to deliberate upon the state of the fort and garrison; and the majority de∣clared for a capitulation. The works were in many places ruined; the body of the castle was shattered; many guns were dismounted, the embrasures and parapets demolished, the palisadoes broke in pieces, the garrison exhausted with hard duty and incessant watching, and the enemy in possession of the sub∣terranean communications. Besides, the governor had received information from prisoners, that the duke de Richelieu was alarmed by a report that the marshal duke de Belleisle would be sent to su∣persede him in the command, and for that reason would hazard another desperate assault, which it was the opinion of the majority the garrison could not sustain. These considerations, added to the
<PB N="334" REF="3470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> despair of being relieved, induced him to demand a capitulation. But this measure was not taken with the unanimous consent of the council. Some of∣ficers observed, that the garrison was very little di∣minished, and still in good spirits: that no breach was made in the body of the castle, nor a single cannon erected to batter in breach: that the loss of an outwork was never deemed a sufficient reason for surrendering such a fortress: that the counter∣scarp was not yet taken, nor, on account of the rocky soil, could be taken, except by assault, which would cost the enemy a greater number than they had lost in their late attempt: that they could not attack the ditch, or batter in breach, before the counterscarp should be taken, and even then they must have recourse to galleries before they could pass the fosse, which was furnished with mines and countermines: finally, they suggested that in all probability the British squadron would be reinforced, and sail back to their relief; or if it should not re∣turn, it was the duty of the governor to defend the place to extremity, without having any regard to the consequences. These remarks being over ruled, the chamade was beat, a conference ensued, and very honourable conditions were granted to the garrison, in consideration of the gallant defence they had made. This it must be owned was vigo∣rous while it lasted, as the French general was said to have lost five thousand men in the siege; whereas the loss of the garrison, which at first fell short of three thousand men, did not exceed one hundred. The capitulation imported that the garrison should march out with all the honours of war, and be con∣veyed by sea to Gibraltar. The French were put
<PB N="335" REF="3480"/>
in possession of one gate, as well as Fort Charles<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and Marlborough redoubt: but the English troops remained in the other works till the seventh day of July, when they embarked. In the mean time reciprocal civilities passed between the commanders and officers of both nations.</P>
<P>The articles of capitulation were no sooner ex∣ecuted than monsieur de la Galissoniere sailed back to Toulon, with all the prizes which had lain at anchor in the harbour of Mahon since the fort of St. Philip was first invested. In all probability the safety of himself and his whole squadron was owing to this expeditious retreat; for in a few days after the surrender of the fort, Sir Edward Hawke's fleet, augmented by five ships of the line, which had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Edw▪ Hawke sails to Minorca.</NOTE> been sent from England, when the first tidings ar∣rived of Minorca's being invaded, now made its appearance off the island: but by this time Galis∣soniere was retired, and the English admiral had the mortification to see the French colours flying upon St. Philip's Castle. What perhaps chagrined this gallant officer still more, he was not provided with frigates, sloops, and small craft to cruise around the island, and intercept the supplies which were daily sent to the enemy. Had he reached Minorca sooner he might have discomfited the French squadron; but he could not have raised the siege of St. Philip's, because the duke de Richelieu had received his rein∣forcements, and such a train of artillery as no forti∣fication could long withstand. Indeed, if the gar∣rison had been considerably reinforced, and the communication with it opened by sea, the defence would have been protracted, and so many vigorous sallies might have been made, that the assailants
<PB N="336" REF="3490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> would have had cause to repent of their enter∣prize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoic∣ings in France, and cla∣mour in England.</NOTE> When the news of this conquest was brought to Versailles, by the count of Egmont, whom the duke de Richelieu had dispatched for that purpose, the people of France were transported with the most extravagant joy. Nothing was seen but tri∣umphs and processions; nothing heard but an∣thems, congratulations, and hyperbolical enco∣miums upon the conqueror of Minorca, who was celebrated in a thousand poems, and studied ora∣tions; while the conduct of the English was vili∣fied and ridiculed in ballads, farces, and pasqui∣nades. Nothing more argues the degeneracy of a warlike nation than the pride of such mean triumph for an advantage which, in more vigorous times, would scarce have been distinguished by the ceremo∣ny of a Te Deum Laudamus. Nor is this childish exultation, that disgraces the laurels of victory, confined to the kingdom of France. Truth obliges us to own, that even the subjects of Great Britain are apt to be elevated by success into an illiberal insolence of self-applause, and contemptuous com∣parison. This must be condemned as a proof of unmanly arrogance, and absurd self▪conceit, by all those who coolly reflect, that the events of war ge∣nerally, if not always, depend upon the genius or misconduct of one individual.</P>
<P>The loss of Minorca was severely felt in Eng∣land, as a national disgrace; but, instead of pro∣ducing dejection and despondence, it excited an universal clamour of rage and resentment, not only against Mr. Byng, who had retreated from the French squadron; but also in reproach of the ad∣ministration,
<PB N="337" REF="3500"/>
which was taxed with having ne∣glected<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the security of Minorca. Nay, some po∣liticians were inflamed into a suspicion, that this important place had been negatively betrayed into the hands of the enemy, that, in case the arms of Great Britain should prosper in other parts of the world, the French king might have some sort of equivalent to restore for the conquests which should be abandoned at the peace. This notion, how∣ever, seems to have been conceived from preju∣dice and party, which now began to appear with the most acrimonious aspect, not only throughout the united kingdoms in general, but even in the s—n's councils.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Hawke, being disappointed in his hope of encountering la Galissoniere, and relieving the English garrison of St. Philip's, at least asserted the empire of Great Britain in the Mediterra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean, by annoying the commerce of the enemy, and blocking up their squadron in the harbour of Tou∣lon. Understanding that the Austrian govern∣ment at Leghorn had detained an English priva∣teer, and imprisoned the captain, on pretence that he had violated the neutrality of the port, he de∣tached two ships of war to insist, in a peremptory manner, on the release of the ship, effects, crew, and captain; and they thought proper to comply with his demand, even without waiting for orders from the court of Vienna. The person in whose behalf the admiral thus interposed, was one Fortu∣natus Wright, a native of Liverpool; who, though a stranger to a sea-life, had, in the last war, equip∣ped a privateer, and distinguished himself in such a manner, by his uncommon vigilance and valour,
<PB N="338" REF="3510"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> that, if he had been indulged with a command<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallantry of For∣tunatus Wright.</NOTE> suitable to his genius, he would have deserved as honourable a place in the annals of the navy, as that which the French have bestowed upon their boasted Gue Trouin, Du Bart, and Thurot. An uncommon exertion of spirit was the occasion of his being detained at this juncture. While he lay at anchor in the harbour of Leghorn, commander of the St. George privateer of Liverpool, a small ship of twelve guns and eighty men, a large French xebeque, mounted with sixteen cannon, and nearly three times the number of his complement, chose her station in view of the harbour, in order to inter∣rupt the British commerce. The gallant Wright could not endure this insult: notwithstanding the enemy's superiority in metal and number of men, he weighed anchor, hoisted his sails, engaged him within sight of the shore, and after a very obstinate dispute, in which the captain, lieutenant, and above threescore of the men belonging to the xe∣beque were killed on the spot, he obliged them to sheer off, and returned to the harbour in triumph. This brave corsair would, no doubt, have signa∣lized himself by many other exploits, had not he, in the sequel, been overtaken in the midst of his career by a dreadful storm, in which the ship foun∣dering▪ he and all his crew perished.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Hawke, having scoured the Medi∣terranean, and insulted the enemy's ports, re∣turned with the homeward bound trade to Gibral∣tar; from when<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, about the latter end of the year, he set sail for England with part of his squadron, leaving the rest in that bay for the protection of our commerce, which in those parts soon began to

suffer extremely from French privateers, that now<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> swarmed in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>General Blakeney had arrived, with the garrison of Minorca, at Portsmouth in the month of No∣vember, and been received with expressions of tumultuous joy: every place through which he passed, celebrated his return with bonfires, illumi∣nations, bell▪ringing, and acclamation: every mouth was opened in his praise, extolling him for the gallant defence he had made in the castle of St. Philip. In a word, the people's veneration for Blakeney increased in proportion to their abhor∣rence of Byng: the first was lifted into an idol of admiration, while the other sunk into an object of reproach; and they were viewed at different ends of a false perspective, through the medium of pre∣judice and passion; of a perspective artfully con∣trived, and applied by certain m—rs for the pur∣poses of self-interest and deceit. The s—is said to have been influenced by the prepossession of the s—t. Mr. Blakeney met with a gracious recep∣tion from his majesty, who raised him to the rank<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Blakeney promoted to the dignity of a baron.</NOTE> of an Irish baron, in consideration of his faithful services, while some malecontents murmured at this mark of favour as an unreasonable sacrifice to popular misapprehension.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year, the measures taken by the government in England, seem to have been chiefly dictated by the dread of an invasion, from which the ministers did not think themselves se∣cured by the guard-ships and cruisers on different parts of the coast, or the standing army of the kingdom, though reinforced by the two bodies of German auxiliaries. A considerable number of

<P>New ships of war were built, and daily put in commission; but it was found impracticable to man them, without having recourse to the odious and illegal practice of impressing sailors, which must always be a reproach to every free people.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding large bounties, granted by the government to volunteers, it was found necessary to lay an embargo upon all shipping, and im∣press all the seamen that could be found, with∣out any regard to former protections; so that all the merchant-ships were stripped of their hands, and foreign commerce for some time wholly suspended. Nay, the expedient of compelling men into the service, was carried to an unusual de∣gree of oppression; for rewards were publicly of∣fered to those who should discover where any sea∣man lay concealed: so that those unhappy people were in some respects treated like felons, dragged from their families and connexions to confinement, mutilation, and death, and totally cut off from the enjoyment of that liberty, which, perhaps at the expence of their lives, their own arms had help∣ed

on condition that all the pos∣sessions in America should be previously put in the situation prescribed by the treaty of Utrecht▪ confirmed by that of Aix-la-Chapelle. The French ministry, instead of complying with this condition, produced an evasive draught of a preli∣minary convention, and this was answered by a counter-proposal. At length the am∣bassador of France demanded, as preliminary conditions, that Great Britain would renounce all claim to the south coast of the river St. Laurence, and the lakes that discharge them∣selves into that river; cede to the French twenty leagues of country lying along the bay of Fundy, which divides Acadia, or Nova Scotia; and all the land between the rivers Ohio and Ouabache. A memorial was afterwards presented on the same subject, including the affair of the neutral islands in the West-Indies; but this was amply refuted in another piece, in which the British ministry observed, that even at the very opening of the commission es∣tablished in Paris, for termi∣nating amicably the disputes in North America, the French invaded Nova Scotia, erected three forts in the heart of that province, and would have de∣stroyed the English settlement at Halifax, had not they been prevented: That the like hos∣tilities were committed upon his Britannic majesty's subjects on the Ohio and Indian lakes, where the governors appoint∣ed by the French king, with∣out any shadow of right, pro∣hibited the English from trad∣ing; seized their traders by force, and sent them prisoners to France; invaded the terri∣tories of Virginia, attacked a fort that covered its frontier, and, to secure their usurpa∣tions, erected, with an armed force, a chain of forts on the lands which they had invaded: That his Britannic majesty had complained of these hostilities to the court of Versailles, but without effect; so that he found himself obliged to provide for the security of his subjects; and as the encroachments made by France were hostile, it could never be unlawful, or irrecon∣cilable with the assurance of his majesty's peaceable disposi∣tion, to repel an aggressor; and that the same motive of self∣defence had forced him to seize the French ships and sailors, in order to deprive that court of the means of making an invasion, with which their mi∣nisters in all the courts of Eu∣rope had menaced England.</NOTE> against the French king, importing, That, since the treaty of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> Aix-la-Chapelle, the usurpations and encroach∣ments made upon the British territories in America had been notorious: That his Britannic majesty had, in divers serious representations to the court

the success of such a dangerous design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the French ambassador was immediately recalled from England, the fortifications of Dunkirk were enlarged, great bodies of troops marched down to the sea coasts of France, and the British dominions threatened with an invasion: That though the king of England, in order to frustrate these inten∣tions, had given orders for seizing at sea the ships of the French king and his subjects, yet he had hitherto contented himself with detaining those ships which had been taken, and preserving their cargoes entire, without proceeding to confiscation; but it being at last evident, from the hostile inva∣sion of Minorca, that the court of Versailles was determined to reject all proposals of accommoda∣tion, and carry on the war with the utmost violence, his Britannic majesty could no longer, consistently with the honour of his crown, and the welfare of his subjects, remain within those bounds, which, from a desire of peace, he had hitherto observed.

He insisted on the attack made by the king of England, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty four, on the French possessions in North America; and afterwards by the English navy on the navigation and commerce of the French subjects, in contempt of the law of nations, and direct violation of treaties. He complained, that the French soldiers and sailors underwent the harshest treatment in the British isles, exceeding those bounds which are prescribed to the most ri∣gorous rights of war, by the law of nature and common humanity. He affirmed, that while the English ministry, under the appearance of sincerity, imposed upon the French ambassador with false protestations, orders diametrically opposite to these deceitful assurances of a speedy accommodation, were actually carrying into execution in North America: That while the court of London em∣ployed every caballing art, and squandered away the subsidies of England, to instigate other powers against France, his most Christian majesty did not even ask of these powers the succours which gua∣ranties and defensive treaties authorised him to de∣mand; but recommended to them such measures only as tended to their own peace and security: That while the English navy, by the most odious violences, and sometimes by the vilest artifices, made captures of French vessels, navigating in full security under the safeguard of public faith, his most Christian majesty released an English srigate taken by a French squadron, and British vessels trading to the ports of France without molestation: That the striking contrast formed by these different
<PB N="347" REF="3600"/>
methods of proceeding would convince all Eu∣rope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> that one court was guided by motives of jealousy, ambition and avarice; and that the con∣duct of the other was founded on principles of honour, justice, and moderation: That the vague imputations contained in the king of England's declaration, had in reality no foundation; and the very manner in which they were set forth, would prove their futility and falshood: That the men∣tion made of the works at Dunkirk, and the troops assembled on the coasts of the ocean, implied the most gross attempt to deceive mankind into a be∣lief, that these were the points which determined the king of England to issue orders for seizing the French vessels; whereas the works at Dunkirk were not begun till after two French ships of war had been taken by an English squadron; and de∣predations had been committed six months upon the subjects of France before the first battalions began their march for the sea-side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on this piece.</NOTE> In a word, the most Christian king, laying aside that politeness and decorum on which his people value themselves above all the nations upon the face of the earth, very roundly taxes his brother monarch's administration with piracy, perfidy, in∣humanity, and deceit.

They expatiated upon the imminent danger to which the British possessions in America were exposed, by the mismanagement and delays which had attended the defence of those invaluable colo∣nies, the object of the present war, the principal source of the wealth and strength of these king∣doms. They lamented the want of a constitu∣tional well-regulated militia, the most natural and certain defence against all invaders whatsoever. They signified their hope, that the authors of the late losses and disappointments would be detected and brought to condign punishment; that his ma∣jesty's known intentions of protecting and defend∣ing his subjects in their rights and possessions, might be faithfully and vigorously carried into exe∣cution; and the large supplies, so necessarily de∣manded, and so chearfully granted, might be reli∣giously applied to the defence of these kingdoms, their colonies, and their commerce, as well as to the annoyance of their inveterate and persidious ene∣mies, the only sure means of obtaining a lasting and honourable peace. In answer to this address the king assured them, that he would not fail to do justice upon any persons who should have been wanting in their duty to him and their country; to enforce obedience and discipline in his fleets and armies; and to support the authority and re∣spect due to his government. Remonstrances of the same kind were presented by different counties and corporations; and the populace clamoured aloud for inquiry and justice.</P>

I have also his royal highness the duke of Cumberland's commands to desire, that you will keep your garrison as alert as possible▪ during this critical time, and give such other assistance as may be in your power for the relief of Minorca; taking care, however, not to fatigue or en∣danger your own garrison.</P>

<PB N="351" REF="3640"/>
Mr. F—ke alledged in his own defence, that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> orders were confused and contradictory, and im∣plied a discretionary power: that the whole number of his garrison did not exceed two thousand six hun∣dred men, after he had spared two hundred and seventy-five to the ships commanded by Mr. Edg∣cumbe: that the ordinary duty of the garrison re∣quiring eight hundred men, the whole number was not sufficient for three reliefs: that, if he had detach∣ed a battalion on board the fleet, he should not have had above two reliefs, at a time when he believed the place was in danger of being attacked, for good reasons which he did not think himself at liberty to
<PB N="352" REF="3650"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> mention: that his orders being doubtful, he held a council of war, which was of opinion, that as undoubted intelligence was received of the French army's being landed in Minorca to the number of between thirteen and sixteen thousand men, and that a French squadron of sixteen ships were station∣ed off the harbour, the sending a detachment equal to a battalion from Gibraltar would be an ineffectual supply for the relief of the place, and a weakening of the garrison from which they must be sent. He observed that supposing the orders to have been po∣sitive, and seven hundred men detached to Minorca, the number remaining at Gibraltar would not have exceeded one thousand five hundred and fifty-six; a deduction of seven hundred more, according to the order of May the twelfth, would have left a remainder of eight hundred and fifty-six: that the men daily on duty in the garrison, including ar∣tificers and labourers in the king's works, amount∣ed to eight hundred and thirty-nine; so that if he had complied with the orders as they arrived, he would not have had more than seventeen men over and above the number necessary for the daily work of the garrison: thus the important fortress of Gibraltar must, at this critical conjuncture, have been left almost naked and defenceless to the at∣tempts of the enemy; and had those detachments been actually sent aboard, it afterwards appeared that they could not have been landed on the island of Minorca. The order transmitted to general F—ke to detain all empty vessels, for a farther transportation of troops, seems to have been super∣fluous; for it can hardly be supposed he could have occasion for them, unless to embark the whole
<PB N="353" REF="3660"/>
garrison, and abandon the place. It seems likewise<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to have been unnecessary to exhort the general to keep his garrison as alert as possible, during that critical time; inasmuch as it would have been im∣possible for the men to have enjoyed the least re∣pose or intermission of duty, had the orders been punctually and literally obeyed. What other as∣sistance it might have been in the governor's power to give for the relief of Minorca, or in what manner he could avoid fatiguing his garrison, while there was an impossibility of relieving the guards, it is not easy to comprehend. Be that as it may, when the trial was finished, and the question put to ac∣quit or suspend for one year, the court was equally divided; and in such cases the casting vote being vested in the president, he threw it into the scale against the prisoner, whom his majesty thought fit to dismiss from his service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of America.</NOTE> The expectation of the public was now eagerly turned towards America, the chief if not the sole scene of our military operations. On the twenty-fifth day of June, Mr. Abercrombie arrived at Al∣bany, the frontier of New York, and assumed the command of the forces there assembled, consisting of two regiments which had served under Brad∣dock, two battalions raised in America, two regi∣ments now transported from England, four inde∣pendent companies which had been many years maintained in New York, the New Jersey regiment, four companies levied in North Carolina, and a body of provincial forces raised by the government of New England. Those to the southward, includ∣ing Pensylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, had not yet determined on any regular plan of operation,
<PB N="354" REF="3670"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and were moreover hard pressed in defending their western frontier from the French and Indians, who, in sculking parties, made sudden irruptions upon their unguarded settlements, burning, plundering, and massacring with the most savage inhumanity. As for South Carolina, the proportion of Negro∣slaves to the number of white inhabitants, was so great in that colony, that the government could not, with any regard to the safety of the province, spare any reinforcement for the general enterprize. The plan of this undertaking had been settled the pre∣ceding year in a council of war held at New York. Here it was resolved to attack the fort of Niagara, situated between the lakes Ontario and Erie, in order to cut off the communication between Ca∣nada and Louisiana, and prevent the French from supporting their new fortresses on the Ohio; to reduce Ticonderago and Crown-Point, so that the frontier of New York might be delivered from the danger of an invasion, and Great Britain become master of the lake Champlain, over which the forces might be transported in any future attempt; to besiege Fort Du Quesne upon the Ohio; and to detach a body of troops, by the river Kennebec, to alarm the capital of Canada. This plan was too extensive for the number of troops which had been prepared: the season was too far advanced before the regiments arrived from England, the different colonies were divided in their opinions, and Mr. Abercrombie postponed the execution of any im∣portant scheme till the arrival of lord Loudon, who was daily expected. The reasons that delayed the reinforcement, and detained his lordship so long, we do not pretend to explain; though we may be
<PB N="355" REF="3680"/>
allowed to observe, that many fair opportunities<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> have been lost by the neglect and procrastination of an English ministry. Certain it is, the unac∣countable delay of this armament rendered it use∣less for a whole year, afforded time and leisure to the enemy to take their precautions against any subsequent attack, and, in the mean time, to pro∣ceed unmolested in distressing the British settle∣ments.</P>
<P>Even before this period, they had attacked and reduced a small post in the country of the Five Na∣tions, occupied by twenty-five Englishmen, who were cruelly butchered to a man, in the midst of those Indians whom Great Britain had long num∣bered among her allies.</P>
<P>Soon after this expedition, having received intel∣ligence that a considerable convoy of provisions and stores, for the garrison at Oswego, would in a little time set out from Schenectady, and be con∣veyed in battoes up the river Onondaga, they formed an ambuscade among the woods and thickets on the north side of that river; but, un∣derstanding the convoy had passed before they reached the place, they resolved to wait the return of the detachment. Their design, however, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">A body of Frenchre∣pulsed by col. Brad∣street on the river Ononda∣ga.</NOTE> frustrated by the vigilance and valour of colonel Bradstreet, who expected such an attempt, and had taken his measures accordingly. On the third day of July, while he stemmed the stream of the river, with his battoes formed into three divisions, they were saluted with the Indian war-whoop, and a ge∣neral discharge of musquetry from the north-shore. Bradstreet immediately ordered his men to land on the opposite bank, and with a few of the foremost
<PB N="356" REF="3690"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> took possession of a small island, where he was forthwith attacked by a party of the enemy, who had forded the river for that purpose; but these were soon repulsed. Another body having passed a mile higher, he advanced to them at the head of two hundred men, and fell upon them, sword in hand, with such vigour, that many were killed on the spot, and the rest driven into the river with such precipitation, that a considerable number of them was drowned. Having received informa∣tion that a third body of them had passed at a ford still higher, he marched thither without hesitation, and pursued them to the other side, where they were entirely routed and dispersed. In this action, which lasted near three hours, about seventy of the battoe-men were killed or wounded: but the ene∣my lost double the number killed, and above se∣venty taken prisoners. In all probability the whole detachment of French, amounting to seven hundred men, would have been cut off, had not a heavy rain interposed, and disabled colonel Bradstreet from following his blow; for that same night he was joined by captain Patten, with his grenadiers, in his march from Oneida to Oswego, and next morn∣ing reinforced with two hundred men, detached to his assistance from the garrison of Oswego: but by this time the rivulets were so swelled by the rain, that it was found impracticable to pursue the enemy through the woods and thickets.</P>
<P>Patten and his grenadiers accompanied the de∣tachment to Oswego, while Bradstreet pursued his voyage to Schenectady; from whence he repaired to Albany, and communicated to general Aber∣crombie the intelligence he had received from the
<PB REF="3700"/>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="357" REF="3710"/>
prisoners, importing, that a large body of the ene∣my<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> were encamped on the eastern side of the lake Ontario, provided with artillery, and all other im∣plements, to besiege the fort of Oswego.</P>
<P>In consequence of this information, major-gene∣ral Webb was ordered to hold himself in readiness to march with one regiment to the relief of that garrison; but, before they could be provided with necessaries, the earl of Loudon arrived at the head-quarters<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Lou∣don ar∣rives at New York.</NOTE> at Albany, on the twenty-ninth day of July. The army at this time is said to have con∣sisted of regular troops to the number of two thou∣sand six hundred, about seven thousand provin∣cials, supposed to be in readiness to march from Fort William Henry, under the command of gene∣ral Winslow, over and above a considerable num∣ber of battoe-men at Albany and Schenectady. The garrison at Oswego amounted to fourteen-hun∣dred soldiers, besides three hundred workmen and sailors, either in the fort, or posted in small parties between the fort and a place called Burnet's field, to secure a safe passage through the country of the Six Nations, upon whose friendship there was no lon∣ger any reliance. By the best accounts received of the enemy's force, they had about three thousand men at Crown Point and Ticonderago upon the lake Champlain: but their chief strength was collected upon the banks of the lake Ontario, where their purpose undoubtedly was to reduce the English fort at Oswego. The immediate object, therefore, of lord Loudon's attention was the relief of this place: but his design was strenuously opposed by the province of New York, and other northern governments, who were much more intent upon
<PB N="358" REF="3720"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the reduction of Crown-Point, and the security of their own frontiers, which they apprehended was connected with this conquest. They insisted upon Winslow's being joined by some regiments of re∣gular troops before he should march against this fortress; and stipulated, that a body of reserve should be detained at Albany, for the defence of that frontier, in case Winslow should fail in his en∣terprize, and be defeated. At length they agreed, that the regiment which Mr. Abercrombie had destined for that purpose, should be detached to the relief of Oswego; and on the twelfth day of August major-general Webb began his march with it from Albany: but on his arrival at the Carrying-place, between the Mohock's river and Wood's creek, he received the disagreeable news that Oswe∣go was taken, and the garrison made prisoners of war. Mr. Webb, apprehending himself in danger of being attacked by the besieging army, began immediately to render the creek impassable, even to canoes, by felling trees, and throwing them into the stream; while the enemy, ignorant of his numbers, and apprehensive of a like visitation from him, took the very same method of preventing his approach: in consequence of this apprehension, he was permitted to retire unmolested.</P>
<P>The loss of the two small forts, called Ontario and Oswego, was a considerable national misfor∣tune. They were erected on the south side of the great lake Ontario, standing on opposite sides, at the mouth of the Onondago river, that discharges itself into the lake, and constituted a post of great importance, where vessels had been built, to cruise upon the lake, which is a kind of inland sea, and
<PB N="359" REF="3730"/>
interrupt the commerce as well as the motions and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> designs of the enemy. The garrison, as we have already observed, consisted of fourteen hundred men, chiefly militia and new-raised recruits, under the command of lieutenant-colonel Mercer, an of∣ficer of courage and experience: but the situation of the forts was very ill chosen; the materials most∣ly timber, or logs of wood; the defences wretch∣edly contrived, and unfinished; and, in a word, the place altogether untenable against any regular approach. Such were the forts which the enemy wisely resolved to reduce. Being under no appre∣hension for Crown-Point, they assembled a body of troops, consisting of thirteen hundred regulars, seventeen hundred Canadians, and a considerable number of Indian auxiliaries, under the command of the marquis de Montcalm, a vigilant and enter∣prising officer, to whom the conduct of the siege was intrusted by the marquis de Vaudrueil, gover∣nor and lieutenant-general of New France. The first step taken by Montcalm was to block up Os∣wego by water with two large armed vessels, and post a strong body of Canadians on the road be∣tween Albany and the forts, to cut off all commu∣nication of succour and intelligence. In the mean time, he embarked his artillery and stores upon the lake, and landed them in the bay of Nixouri, the place of general rendezvous. At another creek, within half a league of Oswego, he erected a bat∣tery for the protection of his vessels; and on the twelfth day of August, at midnight, after his dis∣positions had been made, he opened the trenches before Fort Ontario. The garrison, having fired away all their shells and ammunition, spiked up the
<PB N="360" REF="3740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> cannon, and, deserting the fort, retired next day across the river into Oswego, which was even more exposed than the other, especially when the enemy had taken possession of Ontario, from whence they immediately began to fire without intermission. Colonel Mercer being, on the thirteenth, killed by a cannon-ball, the fort destitute of all cover, the officers divided in opinion, and the garrison in con∣fusion, they next day demanded a capitulation, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oswego reduced by the enemy.</NOTE> surrendered prisoners of war, on condition, that they should be exempted from plunder, conducted to Montreal, and treated with humanity. These conditions, however, the marquis did not punc∣tually observe. The British officers and soldiers were insulted by the savage Indians, who robbed them of their cloaths and baggage, massacred several men as they stood defenceless on the pa∣rade, assassinated lieutenant De la Court as he lay wounded in his tent, under the protection of a French officer, and barbarously scalped all the sick people in the hospital: finally, Montcalm, in direct violation of the articles, as well as in contempt of common humanity, delivered up above twenty men of the garrison to the Indians, in lieu of the same number they had lost during the siege; and, in all probability, these miserable captives were put to death by those barbarians with the most excru∣ciating tortures, according to the execrable custom of the country.</P>
<P>Those who countenance the perpetration of cruel∣ties, at which human nature shudders with horror, ought to be branded as infamous to all posterity Such, however, are the trophies that, in the course of the American war, have distinguished the ope∣rations
<PB N="361" REF="3750"/>
of a people who pique themselves upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> politeness, and the virtues of humanity.</P>
<P>The prisoners taken at Oswego, after having been thus barbarously treated, were conveyed in battoes to Montreal, where they had no reason to complain of their reception; and, before the end of the year, they were exchanged. The victors immediately demolished the two forts (if they de∣served that denomination), in which they found one hundred and twenty-one pieces of artillery, fourteen mortars, with a great quantity of ammu∣nition, warlike stores, and provision, besides two sloops and two hundred battoes, which likewise fell into their hands. Such an important magazine, deposited in a place altogether indefensible, and without the reach of immediate succour, was a fla∣grant proof of egregious folly, temerity, and mis∣conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further proceed∣ings in America.</NOTE> The earl of Loudon, finding the season too far advanced to admit of any enterprize against the enemy, exerted all his endeavours in making pre∣parations for an early campaign in the spring, in securing the frontiers of the English colonies, in forming an uniform plan of action, and promoting a spirit of harmony among the different govern∣ments, which had been long divided by jarring in∣terests, and other sources of dissention.</P>
<P>Mean while, the forts Edward and William Henry were put in a proper posture of defence, and secured with numerous garrisons; and the forces put into winter-quarters at Albany, where comfortable barracks were built for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="3760"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> Fort Granville, on the confines of Pensylvania, an inconsiderable blockhouse, was surprised by a party of French and Indians, who made the garri∣son prisoners, consisting of two and twenty soldiers, with a few women and children. These they load∣ed with flour and provision, and drove into capti∣vity; but the fort they reduced to ashes.</P>
<P>Many shocking murders were perpetrated upon defenceless people, without distinction of age or sex, in different parts of the frontiers: but these outrages were in some measure ballanced by the advantages resulting from a treaty of peace, which the governor of Pensylvania concluded with the Delaware Indians, a powerful tribe that dwell upon the river Sasquehanna, forming, as it were, a line along the southern skirts of the province. At the same time the governor of Virginia secured the friendship and alliance of the Cherokees and Ca∣tawbas, two powerful nations adjoining to that co∣lony, who were able to bring three thousand fight∣ing men into the field. All these circumstances considered, Great Britain had reason to expect that the ensuing campaign would be vigorously prose∣cuted in America, especially as a fresh reinforce∣ment of troops, with a great supply of warlike stores, was sent to that country in fourteen trans∣ports, under convoy of two ships of war, which sailed from Cork in Ireland about the beginning of November.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval transac∣tions in thatcoun∣try.</NOTE> No action of great importance distinguished the naval transactions of this year on the side of Ame∣rica. In the beginning of June captain Spry, who commanded a small squadron, cruising off Louis∣bourg, in the island of Cape Breton, took the Arc
<PB N="363" REF="3770"/>
en Ceil, a French ship of fifty guns, having on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> board near six hundred men, with a large quantity of stores and provisions for the garrison. He like∣wise made prize of another French ship with seven∣ty soldiers, two hundred barrels of powder, two large brass mortars, and other stores of the like destination.</P>
<P>On the twenty-seventh day of July commodore Holmes, being in the same latitude, with two large ships and a couple of sloops, engaged two French ships of the line and four frigates, and obliged them to sheer off, after an obstinate dis∣pute.</P>
<P>A great number of privateers were equipped in this country, as well as in the West India islands belonging to the crown of Great Britain; and as these seas swarmed with French vessels, their cruizes proved very advantageous to the adventurers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transac∣tions in the East Indies.</NOTE> Scenes of still higher import were this year acted by the British arms in the East Indies. The cessa∣tion of hostilities between the English and French companies on the peninsula of Indus, though it en∣couraged Mr. Clive to visit his native country, was not of long duration: for in a few months both sides recommenced their operations, no longer as auxiliaries to the princes of the country, but as principals and rivals, both in arms and commerce. Major Laurence, who now enjoyed the chief com∣mand of the English forces, obtained divers ad∣vantages over the enemy; and prosecuted his suc∣cess with such vigour, as, in all probability, would in a little time have terminated the war according to his own wish, when the progress of his arms was interrupted and suspended by an unfortunate event
<PB N="364" REF="3780"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> at Calcutta, the cause of which is not easily ex∣plained: for extraordinary pains have been taken to throw a veil over some transactions, from whence this calamity was immediately or remotely de∣rived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Calcutta by the viceroy of Bengal.</NOTE> A negotiation was renewed between the English and French companies, when Suzajud-Douza, vice∣roy of Bengal, Bakar, and Orixa, taking umbrage at the refusal of certain duties, to which he laid claim, being particularly incensed at the English governor of Calcutta for having granted protection to one of his subjects whom he had outlawed, and moreover irritated by other pactices of the company, which we cannot pretend to unfold, he levied a numerous army, and marching to Calcutta, invested the place, which was then in no posture of defence. The go∣vernor, intimidated by the number and power of the enemy, abandoned the fort, and with some principal persons residing in the settlement, took refuge on board a ship in the river, carrying along with them their most valuable effects and the books of the company. Thus the defence of the place devolved to Mr. Holwell, the second in command, who with the assistance of a few gallant officers, and a very feeble garrison, maintained it with un∣common courage and resolution against several at∣tacks, until he was overpowered by numbers, and the enemy had forced their way into the castle. Then he was obliged to submit; and the suba, or viceroy, promised, on the word of a soldier, that no injury should be done to him or his garrison.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, they were all driven, to the number of one hundred and forty six persons of both sexes, into a place called the black-hole prison, a cube of
<PB N="365" REF="3790"/>
about eighteen feet, walled up to the eastward and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> southward, the only quarters from which they could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deplo∣rable fate of those who pe∣rished in the dun∣geon.</NOTE> expect the least refreshing air, and open to the westward by two windows strongly barred with iron, through which there was no perceptible cir∣culation. The humane reader will conceive with horror the miserable situation to which they must have been reduced, when thus stewed up in a close sultry night under such a climate as that of Bengal, especially when he reflects that many of them were wounded, and all of them fatigued with hard duty. Transported with rage to find themselves thus bar∣barously cooped up in a place where they must be exposed to suffocation, those hapless victims endea∣voured to force open the door, that they might rush upon the swords of the barbarians by whom they were surrounded: but all their efforts were ineffectual; the door was made to open inwards, and being once shut upon them, the crowd pressed upon it so strongly as to render all their endeavours abortive: then they were overwhelmed with di∣straction and despair. Mr. Holwell, who had placed himself at one of the windows, accosted a Jem∣mautdaar, or serjeant of the Indian guard, and having endeavoured to excite his compassion, by drawing a pathetic picture of their sufferings, pro∣mised to gratify him with a thousand rupees in the morning if he could find means to remove one half of them into a separate apartment. The soldier, allured by the promise of such a reward, assured him he would do his endeavour for their relief, and retired for that purpose; but in a few minutes re∣turned, and told him that the suba, by whose order alone such a step could be taken, was asleep, and
<PB N="366" REF="3800"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> no person durst disturb his repose. By this time a profuse sweat had broke out on every individual, and this was attended with an insatiable thirst, which became the more intolerable as the body was drained of its moisture. In vain those mise∣rable objects stripped themselves of their cloaths, squatted down on their hams, and fanned the air with their hats to produce a refreshing undulation. Many were unable to rise again from this posture, but falling down were trod to death or suff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cated. The dreadful symptom of thirst was now accom∣panied with a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficulty of respiration, and every in∣dividual gasped for breath. Their despair became outrageous: again they attempted to force the door, and provoke the guard to fire upon them by exe∣cration and abuse. The cry of "Water! Water!" issued from every mouth. Even the Jemmautdaar was moved to compassion at their distress. He or∣dered his soldiers to bring some skins of water, which served only to enrage the appetite and in∣crease the general agitation. There was no other way of conveying it through the windows but by hats, and this was rendered ineffectual by the eager∣ness and transports of the wretched prisoners, who at sight of it struggled and raved even into fits of delirium. In consequence of these contests, very little reached those that stood nearest the windows, while the rest at the farther end of the prison were totally excluded from all relief, and continued calling upon their friends for assistance, and con∣juring them by all the tender▪ ties of pity and af∣fection. To those who were indulged, it proved pernicious; for, instead of allaying their thirst, it enraged their impatience for more. The confu∣sion
<PB N="367" REF="3810"/>
became general and horrid: all was clamour<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> and contest: those who were at a distance endea∣voured to force their passage to the window, and the weak were pressed down to the ground, never to rise again. The inhuman ruffians without, de∣rived entertainment from their misery: they sup∣plied the prisoners with more water, and held up lights close to the bars, that they might enjoy the inhuman pleasure of seeing them fight for the bane∣ful indulgence. Mr. Holwell, seeing all his parti∣cular friends lying dead around him, and trampled upon by the living, finding himself wedged up so close as to be deprived of all motion, begged, as the last instance of their regard, that they would remove the pressure, and allow him to retire from the window, that he might die in quiet. Even in those dreadful circumstances, which might be sup∣posed to have levelled all distinction, the poor deli∣rious wretches manifested a respect for his rank and character. They forthwith gave way, and he forced his passage into the center of the place, which was not crowded so much; because, by this time, about one third of the number had perished, and lay in little compass on the floor, while the rest still crowded to both windows. He retired to a platform at the farther end of the room, and, lying down upon some of his dead friends, recommended his soul to heaven. Here his thirst grew insup∣portable: his difficulty in breathing increased, and he was seized with a strong palpitation. These violent symptoms, which he could not bear, urged him to make another effort: he forced his way back to the window, and cried aloud, "Water! for God's sake!" He had been supposed already
<PB N="368" REF="3820"/>

He now breathed more freely, and the palpitation ceased: but finding himself still more thirsty after drinking, he abstained from water, and moistened his mouth from time to time by sucking the per∣spiration from his shirt-sleeves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his despair of obtain∣ing water, this unhappy gen∣tleman had attempted to drink his own urine; but found it intolerably bitter; whereas the moisture that flowed from the pores of his body was soft, pleasant, and refreshing.</NOTE>. The miserable prisoners, perceiving that water rather aggravated than relieved their distress, grew clamorous for air, and repeated their insults to the guard, loading the suba and his governor with the most virulent reproach. From railing, they had recourse to prayer, beseeching heaven to put an end to their misery. They now began to drop on all hands; but then a steam arose from the living, and the dead, as pungent and volatile as spirit of harts∣horn; so that all who could not approach the win∣dows were suffocated. Mr. Holwell, being weary of life, retired once more to the platform, and stretched himself by the reverend Mr. Jervas Bel∣lamy, who, together with his son, a lieutenant, lay dead in each other's embrace. In this situation he was soon deprived of sense, and lay to all ap∣pearance dead till day broke, when his body was discovered, and removed by his surviving friends to one of the windows, where the fresh air revived him, and he was restored to his sight and senses.
<PB N="369" REF="3830"/>
The suba, at last, being informed that the greater<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> part of the prisoners were suffocated, inquired if the chief was alive; and being answered in the af∣firmative, sent an order for their immediate release, when no more than twenty-three survived of an hundred and forty-six who had entered alive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Additio∣nal cruel∣ties exer∣cised on Mr. Hol∣well.</NOTE> Nor was the late deliverance, even of these few, owing to any sentiment of compassion in the vice∣roy. He had received intimation, that there was a considerable treasure secreted in the fort, and that Mr. Holwell knew the place where it was depo∣sited. That gentleman, who, with his surviving companions, had been seized with a putrid fever, immediately upon their release, was dragged in that condition before the inhuman suba, who questioned him about the treasure, which existed no where but in his own imagination; and would give no credit to his protestations, when he solemnly de∣clared he knew of no such deposit. Mr. Holwell and three of his friends were loaded with fetters, and conveyed three miles to the Indian camp, where they lay all night, exposed to a severe rain: next morning they were brought back to town, still manacled, under the scorching beams of a sun intensely hot; and must infallibly have expired, had not nature expelled the fever in large painful boils, that covered almost the whole body. In this piteous condition they were embarked in an open boat for Muxadabad, the capital of Bengal, and underwent such cruel treatment and misery in their passage, as would shock the humane reader, should he peruse the particulars. At Muxadabad they were led through the city in chains, as a spectacle to the inhabitants, lodged in an open stable, and
<PB N="370" REF="3840"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> treated for some days as the worst of criminals. At length the suba's grandmother interposed her mediation in their behalf; and as that prince was by this time convinced that there was no treasure concealed at Calcutta, he ordered them to be set at liberty. When some of his sycophants opposed this indulgence, representing that Mr. Holwell had still enough left to pay a considerable ransom, he replied with some marks of compunction and gene∣rosity, "If he has any thing left, let him keep it: his sufferings have been great: he shall have his liberty." Mr. Holwell and his friends were no sooner unfettered, than they took water for the Dutch Tanksall or mint, in the neighbourhood of the city, where they were received with great ten∣derness and humanity. The reader, we hope, will excuse us for having thus particularized a transac∣tion so interesting and extraordinary in all its cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>By the reduction of Calcutta, the English East-India company's affairs were so much embroiled in that part of the world, that perhaps nothing could have retrieved them but the interposition of a na∣tional force and the good fortune of a Clive, whose enterprizes were always crowned with success. In consequence of the company's representations to the government, a small squadron of large ships was sent to the East-Indies, under the command of ad∣miral Watson; and in the course of this year ar∣rived at Fort St. David's. The governor of that fortress having received intelligence that Tullagee Angria, a piratical prince in the neighbourhood of Bombay, was on the eve of concluding a treaty with the nation of the Marahattas, which might
<PB N="371" REF="3850"/>
prove prejudicial to the interests of the English<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> company; a resolution was taken to drive him from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolu∣tion taken against Angria.</NOTE> his residence at Geriah, which was well fortified, and annihilate his power, which was formidable to all the trading ships of Europe: for he maintained a considerable number of armed gallies called grabs, with which he often attacked the largest ships, when they happened to be becalmed on that part of the coast of Malabar. He was in the fourth generation from the first freebooter, who rendered himself independent, and lived like a sovereign prince possessed of extensive territories. The un∣dertaking against Angria was originally concerted with the Marahattas, who likewise equipped an armament both by sea and land against Geriah; but they acted entirely on their own score: and in the reduction of the place gave no manner of assist∣ance to the English.</P>
<P>Admiral Watson sailed from the coast of Coro∣mandel to Bombay, where his squadron was cleaned and refitted; and having procured proper intelli∣gence with respect to the harbour and fort of Ge∣riah, determined, with the advice of a council of war to proceed on the expedition without delay. Being joined by a division of ships, fitted out at the company's expence, having on board a body of troops commanded by colonel Clive, he sailed on the seventh day of February, and found in the neighbourhood of Geriah the Marahatta fleet, con∣sisting of four grabs and forty smaller vessels, called gallivats, lying to the northward of the place, in a creek called Rajipore; and a land-army of horse and foot, amounting to seven or eight thousand men, the whole commanded by Rhamagee Punt,
<PB N="372" REF="3860"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> who had already taken one small fort, and was ac∣tually treating about the surrender of Geriah. Angria himself had quitted the place; but his wife and family remained under the protection of his brother-in-law; who, being summoned to surren∣der, by a message from the admiral, replied, that he would defend the place to the last extremity. In consequence of this refusal the whole English fleet, in two divisions, sailed on the twelfth day of Fe∣bruary into the harbour, and sustained a warm fire from the enemy's batteries as they passed, as well as from the grabs posted in the harbour for this purpose: this, however, was soon silenced after the ships were brought to their stations, so as to re∣turn the salutation. Between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, a shell being thrown into one of Angria's armed vessels, set her on fire; and the flames communicating to the rest, they were all destroyed: between six and seven the fort was set on fire by another shell; and soon after the firing ceased on both sides. The admiral suspecting that the governor of the place would surrender it to the Marahattas rather than to the English, dis∣embarked all the trooops under Mr. Clive, that he might be at hand in case of emergency to take pos∣session. In the mean time the fort was bom∣barded: the line of battle ships were warped near enough to batter in breach; and then the admiral sent an officer with a flag of truce to the governor, requiring him to surrender. His proposal being again rejected, the English ships renewed their fire next day with redoubled vigour. About one o'clock the magazine of the fort blew up, and at four the garrison hung out a white flag for capitu∣lation.
<PB N="373" REF="3870"/>
The parley that ensued, proving ineffec∣tual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the engagement began again, and continued till fifteen minutes after five; when the white flag was again displayed, and now the governor sub∣mitted to the terms which were imposed. An∣gria's flag was immedlately hauled down; and two English captains taking possession of the fort with a detachment, forthwith hoisted the British ensign. In this place, which was reduced with very incon∣siderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fort of Geriah attacked and taken by admi∣ral Wat∣son and Mr. Clive.</NOTE> loss, the conquerors found above two hundred cannon, six brass mortars, a large quan∣tity of ammunition, with money and effects to the value of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds. The fleet which was destroyed, consisted of eight grabs, one ship finished, two upon the stocks, and a good number of gallivats. Among the prisoners the admiral found Angria's wife, children, and mother, towards whom he demeaned himself with great humanity. Three hundred European fol∣diers, and as many sipoys were left to guard the fort; and four of the company's armed vessels re∣mained in the harbour for the defence of the place, which was extremely well situated for commerce <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the admiral entered their apartment, the whole fa∣mily shedding floods of tears fell with their faces to the ground; from which being raised, the mother of Angria told him, in a piteous tone, the people had no king, she no son, her daughter no hus∣band, their children no father. The admiral replying, "they must look upon him as their father and their friend;" the youngest boy, about six years of age, seized him by the hand, and sobbing exclaimed, "then you shall be my fa∣ther." Mr. Watson was so affected with this pathetic ad∣dress, that the tears trickled down his cheeks, while he as∣sured them they might depend upon his protection and friend∣ship.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The admiral and Mr. Clive sailed back to Ma∣drass in triumph, and there another plan was
<PB N="374" REF="3880"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> formed for restoring the company's affairs upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their subse∣quent proceed∣ings in the river Ganges.</NOTE> Ganges; recovering Calcutta; and taking venge∣ance on the cruel viceroy of Bengal. In October they set sail again for the bottom of the bay; and about the beginning of December arrived at Bala∣sore in the kingdom of Bengal. Having crossed the Braces, they proceeded up the river Ganges as far as Falta, where they found governor Drake and the other persons who had escaped on board of the ships when Calcutta was invested. Colonel Clive was disembarked with his forces to attack the fort of Busbudgia by land, while the admiral bat∣tered it by sea: but the place being ill provided with cannon, did not hold out above an hour after the firing began. This conquest being atchieved at a very easy purchase, two of the great ships an∣chored between Tanna fort and a battery on the other side of the river, which were abandoned be∣fore one shot was discharged against either; thus the passage was laid open to Calcutta, the reduc∣tion of which we shall record among the transac∣tions of the ensuing year.</P>
<P>Having thus, to the best of our power, given a faithful and exact detail of every material event, in which Great Britain was concerned either at home, or in her settlements abroad, during the greatest part of the year one thousand seven hund∣red and fifty-six, we shall now return to Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives of the war in Ger∣many.</NOTE> and endeavour to explain the beginning of a bloody war in Germany, which now seems to have be∣come the chief object of the British councils. On the eve of a rupture between France and England, it was natural for his B—m—to provide for the safety of his e—l d—s, the only quarter
<PB N="375" REF="3890"/>
by which he was at all accessible to the efforts of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the enemy, who he foresaw would not fail to annoy him through that avenue. He at that time stood upon indifferent terms with the k—of P—, who was considered as a partizan and ally of France; and he knew that the house of Austria alone would not be sufficient to support him against two such powerful antagonists. In this emer∣gency he had recourse to the empress of Russia, who, in consequence of a large subsidy granted by England, engaged to furnish a strong body of forces for the defence of H—r. His P—n majesty, startled at the conditions of this treaty, took an opportunity to declare that he would not suffer foreign forces of any nation to enter the em∣pire, either as principals or auxiliaries: a declara∣tion which probably flowed from a jealousy and aversion he had conceived to the court of Peters∣burg, as well as to a resolution he had formed of striking some great stroke in Germany, without any risque of being restricted or controuled. He knew he should give umbrage to the French king, who had already made preparations for penetrating into Westphalia: but he took it for granted he should be able to exchange his connexions with France for an alliance with Great Britain, which would be much less troublesome, and much more productive of advantage: indeed such an alliance was the necessary consequence of his declaration. Had his B—c m—y made a requisition of the Russian auxiliaries, he must have exposed him∣self to the resentment of a warlike monarch, that hovered on the skirts of his electorate at the head of one hundred and fifty thousand men, and could
<PB N="376" REF="3900"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> have subdued the whole country in one week: and if he forbore to avail himself of the treaty with the Czarina, he did not know how soon the k—g of P—a might be reconciled to his most Christian majesty's design of invasion. As for the Empress queen, her attention was engrossed by schemes for her interest or preservation; and her hands so full that she either could not, or would not fulfil the engagements she had contracted with her former and firmest allies. In these circumstances the k—g of E—d sought and obtained the alliance of P—a, which, to the best of our comprehen∣sion, has intailed upon G—B—n the enormous burthen of extravagant subsidies, together with the intolerable expence of a continental war, without being productive of one advantage either positive or negative to E—d or H—r. On the con∣trary, this connexion threw the Empress queen into the arms of France, whose friendship she has bought at the expence of the Barrier in the Nether∣lands, acquired with infinite labour, by the blood and treasure of the maritime powers: it has given birth to a confederacy of despotic princes; suffi∣cient, if their joint force was fully exerted, to overthrow the liberties of all the free states in Eu∣rope; and, after all, H—r has been over-run, and subdued by the enemy; and the k—g of P—a put to the ban of the Empire. All these conse∣quences are, we apprehend, fairly deducible from the resolution which his P—n m—y took, at this juncture, to precipitate a war with the house of Austria.</P>
<P>The apparent motives that prompted him to this measure, we shall presently explain. In the mean
<PB N="377" REF="3910"/>
time the defensive treaty between the Empress∣queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756. Close con∣nexion between the courts of Ver∣sailles and Peters∣burg.</NOTE> and France was no sooner ratified, than the Czarina was invited to accede to the alliance, and a private minister sent from Paris to Petersburg to negotiate the conditions of this accession, which the empress of Russia accordingly embraced: a circumstance so agreeable to the court of Versailles, that the marquis de L'Hopital was immediately ap∣pointed ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentia∣ry to the court of Russia. Applications were likewise made to the courts of Madrid and Turin, solliciting their concurrence; but their Catholic and Sardi∣nian majesties wisely resolved to observe a neutra∣lity.</P>
<P>At the same time intrigues were begun by the French emissaries in the senate of Sweden, in order to kindle up a war between that nation and Prussia; and their endeavours succeeded in the sequel, even contrary to the inclination of their sovereign. At<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspi∣racy in Sweden.</NOTE> present a plot was discovered for altering the form of government, by increasing the power of the crown; and several persons of rank, being con∣victed upon trial, were beheaded as principals in this conspiracy. Although it did not appear that the king or queen was at all concerned in the scheme, his Swedish majesty thought himself so hardly treated by the dyet, that he threatened to resign his royalty and retire into his own heredi∣tary dominions. This design was extremely dis∣agreeable to the people in general, who espoused his cause in opposition to the dyet, by whom they conceived themselves more oppressed than they should have been under an unlimited monarchy: an opinion, which, in all probability, will one day
<PB N="378" REF="3920"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> produce such a revolution in the Swedish govern∣ment as hath happened in that of Denmark, where the power was transferred from the nobles to the crown, by the concurrence of the clergy and the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken by the king of Prussia and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lec∣tor of Ha∣nover.</NOTE> The king of Prussia, alarmed at these formidable alliances, ordered all his forces to be completed, and held in readiness to march at the first notice; and a report was industriously circulated, that by a secret article in the late treaty between France and the house of Austria, these two powers had obliged themselves to destroy the protestant religion, and overturn the freedom of the Empire, by a forced election of a king of the Romans.</P>
<P>The cry of religion was no impolitic measure; but it no longer produced the same effect as in times past. Religion was made a pretence on both sides: for the partizans of the Empress-queen in∣sinuated, on all occasions, that the ruin of the ca∣tholic faith in Germany was the principal object of the new alliance between the kings of Great Bri∣tain and Prussia. It was in consequence of such suggestions, that his Britannic majesty ordered his electoral minister at the dyet to deliver a memorial to all the ministers at Ratisbon, expressing his sur∣prize to find the treaty he had concluded with the king of Prussia, industriously represented as a ground of apprehension and umbrage, especially for religion. He observed, that as France had made open dispositions for invading the electorate of Hanover, and disturbing the peace of the Em∣pire; that as he had been denied, by the Empress-queen, the succours stipulated in treaties of alliance; and as he was refused assistance by certain states of
<PB N="379" REF="3930"/>
the Empire, who even seemed disposed to favour<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> such a diversion; he had, in order to provide for the security of his own dominions, to establish peace and tranquillity in the Empire, and maintain its system and privileges, without any prejudice to re∣ligion, concluded a defensive treaty with the king of Prussia: that, by this instance of patriotic zeal for the welfare of Germany, he had done an essen∣tial service to the Empress-queen, and performed the part which the head of the Empire, in dignity and duty, ought to have acted: that time would demonstrate how little it was the interest of the Empress-queen to engage in a strict alliance with a foreign power, which, for upwards of two cen∣turies, had ravaged the principal provinces of the Empire, maintained repeated was against the archducal house of Austria, and always endeavour∣ed, as it suited her views, to excite distrust and dissension among the princes and states that com∣pose the Germanic body.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna formed two considerable armies in Bohemia and Moravia; yet pretended that they had nothing in view but self-preservation, and solemnly disclaimed both the secret article, and the design which had been laid to their charge. His most Christian majesty declared, by his mi∣nister at Berlin, that he had no other intention but to maintain the public tranquillity of Europe; and this being the sole end of all his measures, he be∣held with surprize the preparations and armaments of certain potentates: that, whatever might be the view with which they were made, he was disposed to make use of the power which God had put into his hands, not only to maintain the public peace of
<PB N="380" REF="3940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> Europe against all who should attempt to disturb it; but also to employ all his forces, agreeable to his engagements, for the assistance of his ally, in case her dominions should be attacked: finally, that he would act in the same manner in behalf of all the other powers with whom he was in al∣liance.</P>
<P>This intimation made very little impression upon the king of Prussia, who had already formed his plan, and was determined to execute his purpose. What his original plan might have been, we shall not pretend to disclose; nor do we believe he im∣parted it to any confident or ally. It must be con∣fessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The court of Vienna endea∣vours to frustrate his de∣signs.</NOTE> however, that the intrigues of the court of Vienna, furnished him with a specious pretence for drawing the sword and commencing hostilities. The empress▪queen had some reason to be jealous of such a formidable neighbour. She remember∣ed his irruption into Bohemia, in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-four, at a time when she thought that country, and all her other dominions secure from his invasion by the treaty of Breslau, which she had in no particular contravened. She caballed against him in different courts of Eu∣rope: she concluded a treaty with the Czarina, which, though seemingly defensive implied an in∣tention of making conquests upon this monarch: she endeavoured to engage the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, as a contracting power in this confederacy; and, if he had not been afraid of a sudden visit from his neighbour of Prussia, it can∣not be supposed but he would have been pleased to contribute to the humiliation of a prince who had once before, without the least provocation, driven
<PB N="381" REF="3950"/>
him from his dominions, taken possession of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> capital, routed his troops, and obliged him to pay a million of crowns to indemnify him for the ex∣pence of this expedition: but he carefully avoided taking such a step as might expose him to another invasion, and even refused to accede to the treaty of Petersburg, though it was expresly defensive; the Casus Foederis being his Prussian majesty's at∣tacking either of the contracting parties. It ap∣pears, however, that the count de Bruhl, prime minister and favourite of the king of Poland, had in conjunction with some of the Austrian ministers, carried on certain scandalous intrigues, in order to embroil the king of Prussia with the empress of Russia, between whom a misunderstanding had long subsisted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Prus∣sian ma∣jesty de∣mands an explana∣tion from the Em∣press-queen.</NOTE> His Prussian majesty, perceiving the military pre∣parations of the court of Vienna, and having ob∣tained intelligence of their secret negotiations with different powers in Europe, ordered M. de Klin∣graafe, his minister at the Imperial court, to de∣mand whether all those preparations of war, on the frontiers of Silesia, were designed against him, and what were the intentions of her Imperial majesty? To this demand the Empress replied, That in the present juncture she had found it necessary to make armaments, as well for her own defence as for that of her allies; but that they did not tend to the prejudice of any person or state whatever. The king, far from being satisfied with this gene∣ral answer, sent fresh orders to Klingraafe to repre∣sent, That after the king had dissembled, as long as he thought consistent with his safety and honour, the bad designs imputed to the Empress would
<PB N="382" REF="3960"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> not suffer him longer to disguise his sentiments; that he was acquainted with the offensive projects, which the two courts had formed at Petersburgh; that he knew they had engaged to attack him sud∣denly with an army of two hundred thousand men; a design which would have been executed in the spring of the year, had not the Russian forces wanted recruits, their fleet mariners, and Livonia a sufficient quantity of corn for their support; that he constituted the Empress arbiter of peace or war: if she desired the former, he required a clear and formal declaration, or positive assurance, that she had no intention to attack him, either this year or the next; but he should look upon an ambigu∣ous answer as a declaration of war; and he called heaven to witness, that the Empress alone would be guilty of the innocent blood that should be spilt, and all the dismal consequences that would attend the commission of hostilities.</P>
<P>A declaration of this nature might have pro∣voked a less haughty court than that of Vienna, and, indeed, seems to have been calculated on pur∣pose to exasperate the pride of her Imperial ma∣jesty, whose answer he soon received to this effect:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her an∣swer.</NOTE> That his majesty the king of Prussia had already been employed, for some time, in all kinds of the most considerable preparations of war, and the most disquieting, with regard to the public tranquillity, when he thought fir to demand explanations of her majesty, touching the military dispositions that were making in her dominions; dispositions on which she had not resolved, till after the preparations of his Prussian majesty had been made; that though her majesty might have declined explaining her∣self
<PB N="383" REF="3970"/>
on those subjects which required no explana∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> she had been pleased to declare, with her own mouth, to Mr. de Klingraafe, that the critical state of public affairs rendered the measures she was taking absolutely necessary for her own safety, and that of her allies; but that, in other respects, they tended to the prejudice of no person whatsoever: that her Imperial majesty had undoubtedly a right to form what judgment she pleased on the circum∣stances of the times; and likewise, that it belonged to none but herself to estimate her own danger: that her declaration was so clear, she never ima∣gined it could be thought otherwise: that being accustomed to receive, as well as to practise the de∣corums which sovereigns owe to each other, she could not hear without astonishment and sensibility the contents of the memorial now presented by Mr. de Klingraafe; so extraordinary, both in the matter and expressions, that she would find herself under a necessity of transgressing the bounds of that moderation which she had prescribed to her∣self, were she to answer the whole of its contents: nevertheless, she thought proper to declare, that the information communicated to his Prussian ma∣jesty of an offensive alliance against him, subsisting between herself and the empress of Russia, toge∣ther with the circumstances and pretended stipula∣tions of that alliance, were absolutely false and forged; for no such treaty did exist, or ever had existed. She concluded with observing, that this declaration would enable all Europe to judge of what weight and quality those dreadful events were which Klingraafe's memorial announced; and to
<PB N="384" REF="3980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> perceive that, in any case, they could not be im∣puted to her Imperial majesty.</P>
<P>This answer, though seemingly explicit, was not deemed sufficiently categorical, or at least not suit∣able to the purposes of the king of Prussia, who, by his resident at Vienna, once more declared, that if the Empress-queen would sign a positive as∣surance that she would not attack his Prussian ma∣jesty either this year or the next, he would directly withdraw his troops, and let things be restored to their former footing. This demand was evaded, on pretence that such an assurance could not be more binding than the solemn treaty by which he was al∣ready secured; a treaty which the Empress-queen had no intention to violate. But before an answer could be delivered, the king had actually invaded<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prus∣sian army enters Saxony, and pub∣lishes a mani∣festo.</NOTE> Saxony, and published his declaration against the court of Vienna. The court of Vienna believ∣ing that the king of Prussia was bent upon em∣ploying his arms somewhere; being piqued at the dictatorial manner in which his demands were conveyed; unwilling to lay themselves under far∣ther restrictions; apprehensive of giving umbrage to their allies; and confident of having provided for their own security; resolved to run the risque of his resentment, not without hope of being indemnified in the course of the war for that part of Silesia which the queen had been obliged to cede in the treaty of Breslau.</P>
<P>Both sides being thus prepared, and perhaps equally eager for action, the king of Prussia would no longer suspend his operations; and the storm first fell upon Saxony. He resolved to penetrate through this country into Bohemia, and even to
<PB N="385" REF="3990"/>
take possession of it as a frontier; as well as<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> for the convenience of ingress and egress to, and from the Austrian dominions. Besides, he had reason to believe the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, was connected with the Czarina and the Empress-queen: therefore he thought it would be impolitic to leave that prince in any condi∣tion to give him the least disturbance. His army entered the Saxon territory towards the latter end of August; when he published a decla∣ration, importing that the unjust conduct and dan∣gerous views of the court of Vienna against his ma∣jesty's dominions, laid him under the necessity of taking proper measures for protecting his territo∣ries and subjects: that for this purpose he could not forbear taking the disagreeable resolution to en∣ter with his troops the hereditary dominions of his majesty the king of Poland, elector of Saxony: but he protested before God and man, that on ac∣count of his personal esteem and friendship for that prince, he would not have proceeded to this extre∣mity, had he not been forced to it by the laws of war, the fatality of the present conjuncture, and the necessity of providing for the defence and se∣curity of his subjects. He reminded the public of the tenderness with which he had treated the elec∣tor of Saxony, during the campaign of the year one thousand seven hundred and forty▪four; and of the bad consequences resulting to that monarch from his engagements with the enemies of Prussia. He declared that the apprehensions of being exposed again to such enterprizes, had obliged him to take those precautions which prudence dictated: but he protested, in the most solemn manner, that he had
<PB N="386" REF="4000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> no hostile views against his Polish majesty, or his dominions; that his troops did not enter Saxony as enemies, and he had taken care that they should observe the best order and the most exact disci∣pline: that he desired nothing more ardently than the happy minute that should procure him the sa∣tisfaction of restoring to his Polish majesty his here∣ditary dominions, which he had seized only as a sa∣cred depositum.</P>
<P>By his minister at Dresden, he had demanded a free passage for his forces through the Saxon do∣minions; and this the king of Poland was ready to grant with reasonable limitations to be settled by commissaries appointed for that purpose. But these were formalities which did not at all suit with his Prussian majesty's disposition or design. Even be∣fore this requisition was made, a body of his troops, amounting to fifteen thousand, under the command of prince Ferdinand, brother to the Duke of Bruns∣wic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdinand takes pos∣session of Leipsic.</NOTE> took possession of Leipsic on the twentieth day of September. Here he published a declaration, signifying that it was his Prussian majesty's inten∣tion to consider and defend the inhabitants of that electorate as if they were his own subjects; and that he had given precise orders to his troops to observe the most exact discipline. As the first mark of his affection, he ordered them to provide the army with all sorts of provision, according to a certain rate, on pain of military execution. That same evening notice was given to the corporation of merchants, that their deputies should pay all taxes and customs to the king of Prussia: then he took possession of the custom-house and excise∣office,
<PB N="387" REF="4010"/>
office, and ordered the magazines of corn and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> meal to be opened for the use of his soldiers.</P>

Thither the king of Poland repaired with his two sons Xave∣rius and Charles; but the queen and the rest of the royal family remained at Dresden. Of this capital his Prussian majesty, with the bulk of his army, took possession on the eighth day of Septem∣ber, when he was visited by the lord Stormont, the English ambassador at that court, accompanied by count Salmour, a Saxon minister, who, in his mas∣ter's name, proposed a neutrality. The king of Prussia professed himself extremely well pleased with the proposal; and, as the most convincing proof of his neutrality, desired the king of Poland would separate his army, by ordering his troops to return to their former quarters. His Polish ma∣jesty did not like to be so tutored in his own domi∣nions: he depended for his own safety more upon the valour and attachment of his troops thus as∣sembled, than upon the friendship of a prince who had invaded his dominions, and sequestered his re∣venue, without provocation; and he trusted too much to the situation of his camp at Pirna, which was deemed impregnable. In the mean time, the king of Prussia fixed his had quarters at Seidli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z, about half a German league distant from Pirna, and posted his army in such a manner as to be able to intercept all convoys of provision designed for

At the same time the king covered his own dominions by as∣sembling two considerable bodies in Upper and Lower Silesia, which occupied the passes that com∣municate with the circles of Buntzlau and Kon∣ingsgratz.</P>
<P>Hostilities were commenced on the thirteenth day of September by a detachment of Prussian hus∣sars, who attacked an Austrian escorte to a convoy of provisions, designed for the Saxon camp; and having routed them, carried off a considerable number of loaded waggons. The magazines at Dresden were filled with an immense quantity of provision and forage for the Prussian army, and the bakers were ordered to prepare a vast quantity of bread, for which purpose thirty new ovens were erected.</P>
<P>When the king of Prussia first arrived at Dres∣den, he lodged at the house of the countess Moc∣zinska; and gave orders that the queen and royal family of Poland should be treated with all due veneration and respect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His majesty seems to have abated of this respect in the sequel, if we may believe the assertions of his Polish majes∣ty's queen and the court of Vienna, who affirmed, that centinels were posted within the palace where the queen and royal family resided; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also at the door of the secre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cabinet, where the papers re∣lating to foreign transaction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were deposited. The keys of this cabinet were seized, and all the writings demanded. The whole Saxon ministry were discharged from their re∣spective employments, and a new commission was establish∣ed by the king of Prussia for the administration of affairs in general. When the queen in∣treated this prince to remove the cen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inels posted within the palace, and contiguous pas∣sages, agreeable to his assu∣rances that all due respect should be observed towards the royal family, the king or∣dered the guards to be dou∣bled, and sent an officer to de∣mand of her majesty the keys of the secret cabinet. The queen obtained this officer's consent, that the doors should be sealed up; but afterwards he returned with orders to break them open: then her majesty, placing herself before the door, said, she trusted so much to the promise of the king of Prussia, that she could not believe he had given such orders. The officer declaring that his orders were positive, and that he durst not disobey them, she continued in the same place, declaring, that if violence was to be used, he must begin with her. The officer returning to acquaint the king with what had passed, her majesty conjured the mi∣nisters of Prussia and England to remind his majesty of his promise; but her representa∣tions had no effect: the officer returned with fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h orders to use force, in spite of the oppo∣sition she might make against it in person.

<P>His Prussian majesty, having left a considerable body of troops for the blockade of Pirna, assumed in person the command of marechal Keith's corps, and advanced to give battle to the enemy. On the twenty-ninth day of September he formed his troops in two columns, and in the evening arrived with his van at Welmina, from when<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he saw the Austrian army posted with its right at Lowoschutz, and its left towards the Egra. Having occupied with six battalions a hollow way, and some rising grounds, which commanded the town of Lowo∣schutz, he remained all night under arms at Wel∣mina; and on the first day of October, early in the morning, formed his whole army in order of battle; the first line, consisting of the infantry, occupying two hi ls, and a bottom betwixt them; the second line being formed of some battalions, and the third composed of the whole cavalry. The Austrian ge∣neral had taken possession of Lowoschutz with a great body of infantry, and placed a battery of cannon in the front of the town: he had formed his cavalry chequerwise, in a line between Lowo∣schutz and the village of Sanschitz; and posted about two thousand Croats and irregulars in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">and he fights the battle of Lowo∣schutz.</NOTE> vineyards and avenues on his right. The morn∣ing was darkened with a thick fog, which vanished about seven: then the Prussian cavalry advanced to attack the enemy's horse; but received such a fire from the irregulars, posted in vineyards, and
<PB N="391" REF="4050"/>
ditches, as well as from a numerous artillery, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> they were obliged to retire for protection to the rear of the Prussian infantry and cannon. There being formed, and led back to the charge, they made an impression on the Austrian cavalry, and drove the irregulars and other bodies of infantry from the ditches, desiles, and vineyards which they possessed: but they suffered so severely in this dan∣gerous service, that the king ordered them to re∣ascend the hill, and take post again behind the in∣fantry, from whence they no more advanced. In the mean time a furious cannonading was main∣tained on both sides, with considerable effect. At length the left of the Prussian infantry was ordered to attack the town of Lowoschutz in flank; but met with a very warm reception, and, in all like∣lihood, would have miscarried, had not veldt-marechal Keith headed them in person: when he drew his sword, and told them he would lead them on, he was given to understand, that all their pow∣der and shot was exhausted: he turned imme∣diately to them with a chearful countenance, said he was very glad they had no more ammunition, being well assured the enemy would not withstand them at push of bayonet: so saying, he advanced at their head, and driving the Austrians from Lowo∣schutz, set the suburbs on fire. Their infantry had been already obliged to quit the eminen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the right, and now their whole army retired to Budin, on the other side of the Egra. Some pri∣soners, colours, and pieces of cannon, were taken on both sides; and the loss of each might amount to two thousand five hundred killed and wounded: so that, on the whole, it was a drawn battle, though
<PB N="392" REF="4060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> both generals claimed the victory. The detail of the action, published at Berlin, declares, that the king of Prussia not only gained the battle, but that same day established his head-quarters at Lowo∣schutz: whereas the Austrian gazette affirms, that the marechal count Brown obliged his Prussian majesty to retire, and remained all night on the field of battle; but next day, finding his troops in want of water, he repaired to the camp of Budin. If the battle was at all decisive, the advantage cer∣tainly fell to the Austrians; for his Prussian ma∣jesty, who, in all probability, had hoped to winter at Prague, was obliged, by the opposition he met with, to resign this plan, and retreat before winter into the electorate of Saxony.</P>
<P>The Prussian army having rejoined that body which had been left to block up the Saxons at Pirna, his Polish majesty and his troops were re∣duced to such extremity of want, that it became indispensibly necessary either to attempt an escape, or surrender to the king of Prussia. The former part of the alternative was chosen, and the plan concerted with count Brown, the Austrian general, who, in order to facilitate the execution, advanced privately with a body of troops to Lichtendorf, near Schandau; but the junction could not be ef∣fected. On the fourteenth day of October the Saxons threw a bridge of boats over the Elbe near Konigstein, to which castle they removed all their artillery: then striking their tents in the night, passed the river undiscovered by the enemy. They continued to retreat with all possible expedition; but, the roads were so bad, they made little pro∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess.

<P>In this deplorable condition they remained, when the king of Poland, from the fortress of Konig∣stein, sent a letter to his general the veldt-marechal count Rutowski, vesting him with full and discre∣tionary power to surrender, or take such other measures as he should judge most conducive to the preservation of the officers and soldiers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The letter was to the fol∣lowing effect:

<P>The king of Poland, being thus deprived of his electoral dominions, his troops, arms, artillery, and ammunition, thought it high time to provide for his own safety, and retired with all expedition to Poland. His Prussian majesty cantoned his forces in the neighbourhood of Seidlitz, and along the Elbe towards Dresden. His other army, which had entered Bohemia under the command of the count de Schwerin, retired to the confines of the county of Glatz, where they were distributed in quarters of cantonment; so that this short cam∣paign was finished by the beginning of November.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King of Poland's memorial to the States General.</NOTE> The king of Poland, in his distress, did not fail to implore the assistance and mediation of neutral powers. His minister at the Hague presented a memorial to the States General, complaining, that the invasion of Saxony was one of these attacks against the law of nations, which, from the great respect due to this law, demanded the assistance of every power interested in the preservation of its own liberty and independency. He observed, that, from the first glimpse of misunderstanding between the courts of Vienna and Berlin, he had expresly enjoined his ministers at all the courts of Europe to declare, that it was his firm resolution, in the present conjuncture of affairs, to observe the strict∣est neutrality. He represented that a free and neutral state had been, in the midst of peace, in∣vaded by an enemy who disguised himself under
<PB N="395" REF="4090"/>
the masque of friendship, without alledging the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> least complaint, or any pretension whatsoever; but founding himself solely on his own convenience, made himself master, by armed force, of all the ci∣ties and towns of the electorate, dismantling some, and fortifying others: that he had disarmed the burghers; carried off the magistrates as hostages for the payment of unjust and enormous contribu∣tions of provisions and forage; seized the coffers, confiscated the revenues of the electorate, broke open the arsenals, and transported the arms and artillery to his own town of Magdeburg; abolished the privy-council, and, instead of the lawful go∣vernment, established a directory, which acknow∣ledged no other law but his own arbitrary will. He gave them to understand, that all these pro∣ceedings were no other than preliminaries to the unheard▪of treatment which was reserved for a queen, whose virtues ought to have commanded respect, even from her enemies: that, from the hands of that august princess, the archives of the state were forced away by menaces and violences, notwithstanding the security which her majesty had promised herself under the protection of all laws, human and divine; and notwithstanding the re∣peated assurances given by the king of Prussia, that not only her person, and the place of her resi∣dence, should be absolutely safe, but that even the Prussian garrison should be under her direction. He observed, that a prince who declared himself protector of the protestant religion had begun the war, by crushing the very state to which that very religion owes its establishment, and the preserva∣tion of its most invaluable rights: that he had
<PB N="396" REF="4100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> broke through the most respectable laws which constitute the union of the Germanic body, under colour of a defence which the Empire stood in no need of, except against himself: that the king of Prussia, while he insists on having entered Saxony as a friend, demands his army, the administration of his dominions, and, in a word, the sacrifice of his whole electorate; and that the Prussian direc∣tory, in the declaration of motives, published un∣der the nose of a prince to whom friendship was pretended, thought it superfluous to alledge even any pretext, to colour the usurpation of his terri∣tories and revenues.</P>
<P>Though this was certainly the case, in his Prus∣sian majesty's first exposition of motives, the omis∣sion was afterwards supplied in a subsequent me∣morial to the States General; in which he charged the king of Poland, as an accomplice in, if not an accessory to the treaty of Petersburg; and even taxed him with having agreed to a partition of some Prussian territories, when they should be con∣quered. This treaty of partition, however, ap∣pears to have been made in time of actual war, be∣fore all cause of dispute was removed by the peace of Dresden.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperial decrees published against the king of Prussia.</NOTE> While the Austrian and Prussian armies were in the field, their respective ministers were not idle at Ratisbon, where three Imperial decrees were published against his Prussian majesty: the first, summoning that prince to withdraw his troops from the electorate of Saxony; the second, commanding all the vassals of the empire employed by the king of Prussia to quit that service immediately; and the third, forbidding the members of the Empire
<PB N="397" REF="4110"/>
to suffer any levies of soldiers, for the Prussian ser∣vice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to be raised within their respective jurisdic∣tions. The French minister declared to the dyet, that the proceedings of his Prussian majesty having disclosed to the world the project concerted be∣tween that prince and the king of England, to ex∣cite in the Empire a religious war, which might be favourable to their particular views, his most Chris∣tian majesty, in consequence of his engagements with the Empress-queen, and many other princes of the Empire, being resolved to succour them in the most efficacious manner, would forth with send such a number of troops to their aid, as might be thought necessary to preserve the liberty of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Prussian minister assured the dyet, that his master would very soon produce the proofs that were come to his hands of the plan concerted by the courts of Vienna and Dresden, for the subversion of his electoral house, and for imposing upon him a yoke, which seemed to threaten the whole Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Declara∣tions of different powers.</NOTE> About the same time the Russian resident at the Hague communicated to the States General a de∣claration from his mistress, importing, that her Imperial majecty having seen a memorial presented at the court of Vienna by the king of Prussia's en∣voy extraordinary, was thereby convinced that his Prussian majesty's intention was to attack the ter∣ritories of the Empress-queen; in which case, she (the Czarina) was inevitably obliged to succour her ally with all her forces; for which end she had or∣dered all her troops in Livonia to be forth with as∣sembled on the frontiers, and hold themselves in
<PB N="398" REF="4120"/>

The ministers of the Empress-queen, both at the Hague and at London, delivered memorials to the States Gene∣ral and his Britannic majesty, demanding the suc∣cours which these two powers were bound to af∣ford the house of Austria by the treaty of Aix-la▪ Chapelle; but their high mightinesses kept warily aloof by dint of evasion, and the king of Great Britain was far otherwise engaged.</P>
<P>The invasion of Saxony had well nigh produced tragedies in the royal family of France. The dau∣phiness, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, no sooner learned the distressful circumstances of her parents, the king and queen of Poland, than she was seized with violent fits, which occasioned a miscarriage, and brought her life into the most imminent danger.</P>
<P>The Prussian minister was immediately ordered to quit Versailles; and directions were dispatched to the French minister at Berlin, to retire from that court without taking leave. Finally, the em∣peror of Germany concluded a new convention with the French king, regulating the succours to be derived from that quarter: he claimed in all the usual forms, the assistance of the Germanic body as guaranty of the pragmatic sanction and treaty of Dresden; and Sweden was also addressed on the same subject.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia did not passively bear all the imputations that were fixed upon his conduct. His minister at the Hague presented a memorial
<PB N="399" REF="4130"/>
in answer to that of the Saxon resident, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756. His Prus∣sian ma∣jesty's an∣swer to the Saxon memo∣rial.</NOTE> he accused the court of Dresden of having adopted every part of the scheme which his enemies had formed for his destruction. He affirmed that the Saxon ministers had, in all the courts of Europe, played off every engine of unwarrantable politics, in order to pave the way for the execution of their project: that they had endeavoured to give an odious turn to his most innocent actions: that they had spared neither malicious insinuations, nor even the most atrocious calumnies, to alienate all the world from his majesty, and raise up enemies against him every where. He said he had received inform∣ation that the court of Saxony intended to let his troops pass freely, and afterwards wait for events of which they might avail themselves, either by joining his enemies, or making a diversion in his dominions: that in such a situation he could not avoid having recourse to the only means which were left him for preventing his inevitable ruin, by putting it out of the power of Saxony to encrease the number of his enemies. He asserted that all the measures he had pursued in that electorate were but the necessary consequences of the first re∣solution he was forced to take for his own preser∣vation: that he had done nothing but deprived the court of Saxony of the means of hurting him; and this had been done with all possible moderation: that the country enjoyed all the security and all the quiet which could be expected in the very midst of peace, the Prussian troops observing the most exact discipline: that all due respect was shewn to the queen of Poland, who had been prevailed upon by the most suitable representations, to suffer some
<PB N="400" REF="4140"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> papers to be taken from the paper office, of which his Prussian majesty already had copies; and thought it necessary, to ascertain the dangerous de∣sign of the Saxon ministry against him, to secure the originals; the existence and reality of which might otherwise have been denied <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Can the levying exorbi∣tant contributions, and seizing the revenues of the electorate, be deemed instances of mode∣ration? Was it consistent with the respect due to a venerable queen, to place centries upon her palace both without and within, and send orders even to do violence on her person should she attempt to hinder the offi∣cer from breaking open the cabinet?</NOTE>. He observed that every man has a right to prevent the mischief with which he is threatened, and to retort it upon its author; and that neither the constitutions nor the laws of the Empire could obstruct the exertion of a right so superior to all others, as that of self-preservation and self-defence; especially when the depository of these laws is so closely united to the enemy as manifestly to abuse his power in her fa∣vour.</P>
<P>But the most important step which his Prussian<NOTE PLACE="marg">A justifi∣cation of his con∣duct.</NOTE> majesty took in his own justification, was that of publishing another memorial specifying the con∣duct of the court of Vienna and Saxony, and their dangerous designs against his person and inte∣rest, together with the original documents adduced as proofs of these sinister intentions. As a know∣ledge of these pieces is requisite to form a distinct idea of the motives which produced this dreadful war upon the continent, it will not be amiss to usher the substance of them to the reader's ac∣quaintance. His Prussian majesty affirms, that to arrive at the source of the vast plan upon which
<PB N="401" REF="4150"/>
the courts of Vienna and Saxony had been em∣ployed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> against him ever since the peace of Dres∣den, we must trace it as far back as the war which preceeded this peace: that the fond hopes which the two allied courts had conceived upon the suc∣cess of the campaign in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty four, gave occasion to a treaty of eventual partition, stipulating that the court of Vienna should possess the dutchy of Silesia, and the county of Glatz: while the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, should share the dutchies of Magdebourg and Crois<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en; the circles of Zullichow and Swibus, together with the Prussian part of Lu∣satia: that after the peace of Dresden, concluded in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-five, there was no further room for a treaty of this nature: yet the court of Vienna proposed to that of Saxony a new alliance, in which the treaty of eventual partition should be renewed: but this last thought it necessary, in the first place, to give a greater consistency to their plan, by grounding it upon an alliance between the Empress▪queen and the Czarina. Accordingly these two powers did, in fact, conclude a defensive alliance at Petersburg in the course of the ensuing year: but the body or ostensible part of this treaty was composed meerly with a view to conceal from the knowledge of the public, six secret articles, the fourth of which was levelled singly against Prussia, according to the exact copy of it, which appeared among the docu∣ments. In this article, the Empress-queen of Hungary and Bohemia sets out with a protestation, that she will religiously observe the treaty of Dres∣den; but explains her real way of thinking upon
<PB N="402" REF="4160"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the subject, a little lower in the following terms: "If the king of Prussia should be the first to de∣part from this peace, by attacking either her ma∣jesty the Empress▪queen of Hungary and Bohemia, or her majesty the empress of Russia, or even the republic of Poland; in all these cases, the rights of the Empress▪queen to Silesia and the county of Glatz, would again take place, and recover their full effect: the two contracting parties should mu∣tually assist each other with sixty thousand men to atchieve these conquests. The king observes upon this article, that every war which can arise between him and Russia, or the republic of Poland, would be looked upon as a manifest infraction of the peace of Dresden, and a revival of the rights of the house of Austria to Silesia; though neither Russia nor the republic of Poland is at all concerned in the treaty of Dresden; and though the latter, with which the king lived in the most intimate friendship, was not even in alliance with the court of Vienna: that, ac∣cording to the principles of the law of nature, re∣ceived among all civilized nations, the most the court of Vienna could be authorised to do in such cases, would be to send those succours to her al∣lies which are due to them by treaties, without her having the least pretence, on that account, to free herself from the particular engagements subsisting between her and the king: he appealed therefore to the judgment of the impartial world, whether in this secret article the contracting powers had kept within the bounds of a defensive alliance: or whe∣ther this article did not rather contain a plan of an offensive alliance against the king of Prussia. He affirmed it was obvious, from this article, that the
<PB N="403" REF="4170"/>
court of Vienna had prepared three pretences for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the recovery of Silesia; and that she thought to attain her end either by provoking the king to commence hostilities against her, or to kindle a war between his majesty and Russia by her secret intrigues and machinations: he alledges that the court of Saxony, being invited to accede to this alliance, eagerly accepted the invitation; furnished its ministers at Petersburg with full powers for that purpose; and ordered them to declare that their master was not only ready to accede to the treaty itself, but also to the secret article against Prussia; and to join in the regulations made by the two courts, provided effectual measures should be taken, as well for the security of Saxony, as for its indemnification and recompence, in proportion to the efforts and progress that might be made: that the court of Dresden declared, if upon any fresh attack from the king of Prussia, the Empress-queen should, by their assistance, not only reconquer Si∣lesia, and the county of Glatz, but also reduce him within narrower bounds; the king of Poland, as elector of Saxony, would abide by the partition formerly stipulated between him and the Empress-queen. He also declared that count Loss, the Saxon minister at Vienna, was charged to open a private ne∣gotiation for settling an eventual partition of the con∣quest which might be made on Prussia, by laying down, as the basis of it, the treaty of Leipsic, signed on the eighteenth day of May, in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and forty five; as would ap∣pear by the documents affixed. He owned it had been supposed, through the whole of this negoti∣ation, that the king of Prussia should be the ag∣gressor
<PB N="404" REF="4180"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> against the court of Vienna; but he in∣sisted, that even in this case the king of Poland could have no right to make conquests on his Prus∣sian majesty. He likewise acknowledged that the court of Saxony had not yet acceded in form to the treaty of Petersburg; but he observed, its al∣lies were given to understand again and again, that it was ready to accede without restriction, whenever this could be done without risque; and the advan∣tages to be gained should be secured in its favour: circumstances proved by divers authentic docu∣ments, particularly by a letter from count Fleming to count de Bruhl, informing him that count Uhlefield had charged him to represent afresh to h s court, that they could not take too secure mea∣sures against the ambitious views of the king of Prussia; that Saxony in particular, ought to be cautious, as being the most exposed: that it was of the highest importance to strengthen their old en∣gagements upon the footing proposed by the late count de Harrach in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty five; a step which might be taken on occasion of his Polish majesty's accession to the treaty of Petersburg. The answer of count Bruhl to this dispatch imported, that the king of Poland was not averse to treat in the utmost se∣crecy with the court of Vienna, about succours, by private and confidential declarations relating to the fourth secret article of the treaty of Petersburg, on condition of reasonable terms and advantages, which in this case ought to be granted to his ma∣jesty. He quoted other dispatches to prove the un∣willingness of his Polish majesty to declare himself, until the king of Prussia should be attacked, and
<PB N="405" REF="4190"/>
his forces divided; and that this scruple was ad∣mitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> by the allies of Saxony. From these pre∣mises he deduced this inference, that the court of Dresden, without having acceded in form to the treaty of Petersburg, was not less an accomplice in the dangerous designs which the court of Vienna had grounded upon this treaty; and that having been dispensed with from a formal concurrence, it had only waited for that moment when it might, without running any great risque, concur in effect, and share the spoils of its neighbour. In expecta∣tion of this period, he said the Austrian and Saxon ministers laboured in concert and underhand with the more ardour, to bring the Casus Foederis into existence; for it being laid down as a principle in the treaty, that any war whatever between him and Russia, would authorise the Empress-queen to re∣take Silesia, there was nothing more to be done but to kindle such a war; for which purpose no method was found more proper than that of em∣broiling the king with the empress of Russia; and to provoke that princess, with all sorts of false in∣sinuations, impostures, and the most atrocious ca∣lumnies, in laying to his majesty's charge a variety of designs, sometimes against Russia, and even the person of the Czarina; sometimes views upon Poland, and sometimes intrigues in Sweden. By these and other such contrivances, he affirmed they had kind∣led the animosity of the Empress to such a degree, that in a couucil held in the month of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty three, she had resolved to attack the king of Prussia with∣out any further discussion, whether he should fall upon any of the allies of Russia, or one of them

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> should begin with him: a resolution which for that time was frustrated by their want of seamen and magazines; but the preparations were continued, under pretence of keeping themselves in a condi∣tion to fulfil their engagements contracted in the last subsidiary convention with England; and when all were finished, the storm would fall on the king of Prussia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e piece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> This is the substance of that famous memorial published by his Prussian majesty, to which the justifying pieces or authentic documents were an∣nexed; and to which a circumstantial answer was exhibited by the partisans of her Imperial majesty. Specious reasons may, doubtless, be adduced on either side of almost any dispute, by writers of in∣genuity: but, in examining this contest, it must be allowed that both sides adopted illicit practices. The Empress-queen and the elector of Saxony had certainly a right to form defensive treaties for their own preservation; and without all doubt, it was their interest and their duty to secure themselves from the enterprizes of such a formidable neigh∣bour: but at the same time the contracting parties seem to have carried their views much farther than defensive measures. Perhaps the court of Vienna considered the cession of Silesia as a circumstance altogether compulsive, and therefore not binding against the rights of natural equity. She did not at all doubt that the king of Prussia would be tempted by his ambition and great warlike power, to take some step which might be justly interpreted into an infraction of the treaty of Dresden; and in that case she was determined to avail herself of the confederacy she had formed, that she might re∣trieve
<PB N="407" REF="4210"/>
the countries she had lost by the unfortunate<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> events of the last war, as well as bridle the dange∣rous power and disposition of the Prussian mo∣narch: and in all probability, the king of Poland, over and above the same consideration, was desirous of some indemnification for the last irruption in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his electoral dominions, and the great sums he had paid for the subsequent peace. Whether they were authorised by the law of nature and nations to make reprisals by an actual partition of the coun∣tries they might conquer, supposing him to be the aggressor, we shall not pretend to determine: but it does not at all appear that his Prussian majesty's danger was such as intitled him to take those vio∣lent steps which he now attempted to justify. By this time the flame of war was kindled up to a blaze that soon filled the empire with ruin and de∣solation; and the king of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussia had drawn upon himself the resentment of the three greatest powers in Europe, who laid aside their former animosities, and every consideration of that balance, which it had cost such blood and treasure to preserve, in or∣der to conspire his destruction. The king him∣self could not but foresee this confederacy, and know the power it might exert: but probably he confided so much in the number, the valour and discipline of his troops; in the skill of his officers; in his own conduct and activity; that he hoped to crush the house of Austria by one rapid endeavour at the latter end of the season, or at least establish himself in Bohemia, before her allies could move to her assistance. In this hope, however, he was disappointed by the vigilance of the Austrian coun∣cils. He found the Empress-queen in a condition
<PB N="408" REF="4220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to make head against him in every avenue to her dominions; and in a fair way of being assisted by the circles of the empire. He saw himself threat∣ened with the vengeance of the Russian empress, and the sword of France gleaming over his head, without any prospect of assistance but that which he might derive from his alliance with Great Britain. Thus the k—of E—d exchanged the alliance of R—, which was his subsidiary, and the friend∣ship of the Empress-queen, his old and natural ally, for a new connexion with his P—n majesty, who could neither act as an auxiliary to G—B—n, nor as a protector to H—r; and for this connec∣tion, the advantage of which was merely nega∣tive, such a price was paid by E—d, as had never been given by any other potentate of Europe, even for services of the greatest importance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes continue between theparlia∣ment of Paris and the clergy of France.</NOTE> About the latter end of November, the Saxon minister at Ratisbon delivered to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yet a new and ample memorial, explaining the lamentable state of that electorate, and imploring afresh the assistance of the Empire. The king of Prussia had also addressed a letter to the dyet, demand∣ing succour of the several states, agreeable to their guaranties of the treaties of Westphalia, and Dres∣den: but the minister of Mentz, as director of the dyet, having refused to lay it before that assembly, the minister of Brandenburg ordered it to be printed, and sent to his court for further in∣structions. In the mean time his Prussian majesty thought proper to intimate to the king and senate of Poland, that should the Russian troops be per∣mitted to march through that kingdom, they might expect to see their country made a scene of
<PB N="409" REF="4230"/>
war and desolation. In France the prospect of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> general and sanguinary war did not at all allay the disturbance which sprang from the dissension be∣tween the clergy and parliament, touching the bull Unigenitus. The king being again brought over to the ecclesiastical side of the dispute, received a brief from the pope, laying it down as a funda∣mental article, that whosoever refuses to submit to the bull Unigenitus is in the way to damnation: and certain cases are specified in which the sa∣craments are to be denied. The parliament of Paris, considering this brief or bull as a direct attack upon the rights of the Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>can church, issued an arret or decree suppressing the said bull; reserving to themselves the right of providing against the in∣conveniencies with which it might be attended; as well as the privilege to maintain in their full force the prerogatives of the crown, the power and ju∣risdiction of the bishops, the liberties of the Gallican church, and the customs of the realm. The king, dissatissied with their interposition, declared his de∣sign to hold a bed of justice in person at the pa∣lace. Accordingly, on the twelfth day of Novem∣ber, the whole body of his guards, amounting to ten thousand men, took post in the city of Paris: and next day the king repaired with the usual cere∣mony to the palace where the bed of justice was held: among other regulations, an edict was issued for suppressing the fourth and fifth cham∣bers of inquests, the members of which had re∣markably distinguished themselves by their oppo∣sition to the bull Unigenitus.</P>

Disorders of the same nature were excited by the colliers in the forest of Dean, and those employed in the works of Cumberland. The cor∣porations, noblemen, and gentlemen, in different parts of the kingdom, exerted themselves for the relief of the poor, who were greatly distressed; and a grand council being assembled at St. James's on the same subject, a proclamation was published for putting the laws in speedy and effectual execution against the forestallers and engrossers of corn.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> On the second day of December, his majesty opened the session of parliament, with a speech that<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's speech to the par∣liament.</NOTE> seemed to be dictated by the genius of England. He expressed his confidence, that, under the guid∣ance of divine Providence, the union, fortitude, and affection of his people, would enable him to surmount all difficulties, and vindicate the dignity of his crown against the antient enemy of Great Britain. He declared that the succour and preser∣vation of America constituted a main object of his attention and sollicitude; and observed, that the growing dangers to which the British colonies might stand exposed from late losses in that coun∣try, demanded resolutions of vigour and dispatch. He said an adequate and firm defence at home should maintain the chief place in his thoughts; and in this great view he had nothing so much at heart, as to remove all grounds of dissatisfaction from his people: for this end, he recommended to the care and diligence of the parliament the framing of a national militia, planned and regu∣lated with equal regard to the just rights of his crown and people; an institution which might be∣come one good resource in times of general dan∣ger. He took notice that the unnatural union of councils abroad, the calamities which, in conse∣quence of this unhappy conjunction, might, by irruptions of foreign armies into the Empire, shake its constitution, overturn its system, and threaten oppression to the protestant interest on the conti∣nent, were events which must sensibly affect the minds of the British nation; and had fixed the eyes of Europe on this new and dangerous crisis. He gave them to understand that the body of his
<PB N="412" REF="4260"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> electoral troops, which were brought hither at the desire of his parliament, he had now directed to re∣turn to his dominions in Germany, relying with plea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure on the spirit and zeal of his people, in de∣fence of his person and realm. He told the com∣mons that he confided in their wisdom, for prefer∣ring more vigorous efforts, though more expensive, to a less effectual, and therefore l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss frugal plan of war; that he had placed before them the dangers and necessities of the public: and it was their duty to lay the burdens they should judge unavoidable, in such a manner as would least disturb and ex∣haust his people. He expressed his concern for the sufferings of the poor, arising from the present dearth of corn, and for the disturbances to which it had given r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se; and exhorted his parliament to consider of proper provisions for preventing the like mischiess hereafter. He concluded with re∣marking, that unprosperous events of war in the Mediterranean had drawn from his subjects signal proofs how dearly they tendered the honour of his crown; therefore they could not, on his part, fail to meet with just returns of unwearied care, and unceasing endeavours for the glory, prosperity, and happiness of his people.</P>

In one part of it his majesty was thanked for having caused a body of electoral troops to come into England at the re∣quest of his parliament; and this article was dis∣agreeable to those who had disapproved of the

They said they wished<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> to see the present address unanimously agreed to by the lords; a satisfaction they could not have if such a paragraph should be inserted: for they still thought the bringing over Hanoverian troops a preposterous measure; because it had not only loaded the nation with an enormous expence, but also furnished the court of France with a plausible pretence for invading the electorate, which other∣wise it would have no shadow of reason to attack; besides, the expedient was held in reprobation by the subjects in general, and such a paragraph might be considered as an insult on the people. Notwithstanding these exceptions, which did not seem to be very important, the address including this paragraph, was approved by a great majority.</P>
<P>In the address of the commons no such pa∣ragraph<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill prohibit∣ing for a limited time the exporta∣tion of corn, &amp;c.</NOTE> was inserted. As soon as the speaker had recited his majesty's speech, Mr. C. Townshend proposed the heads of an address, to which the house unanimously agreed; and it was presented accordingly. This necessary form was no sooner discussed, than the house, with a warmth of huma∣nity and benevolence suitable to such an assembly, resolved itself into a committee to deliberate on that part of his majesty's speech which related to the dearth of corn, that so much distressed the poorer class of people. A bill was immediately framed, to prohibit for a time limited, the exportation of corn, malt, meal, flour, bread, biscuit and starch; and a resolution unanimously taken to ad∣dress the sovereign, that an embargo might be forthwith laid upon all ships laden or to be laden

parchment, or paper, for which a stamp-duty of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> six pence was payable by a former act of parlia∣ment; an additional stamp-duty of five pounds upon every licence for retailing wine, to be granted to those who should not take out licences for re∣tailing spirits, beer, ale, or other exciseable liquors; an additional stamp-duty of four pounds for a wine licence to be granted to any person who should take out a licence for retailing beer, ale, and other exciseable liquors, but should not take out a licence for retailing spirituous liquors; of an ad∣ditional stamp-duty of forty shillings for a licence to retail wine, to be granted to any person who should take out a licence for retailing spirituous liquors: these licences to be taken out annually, and granted by the commissioners appointed for managing the duties arising by stamps upon vel∣lum, parchment, and paper. They resolved to re∣peal the act for the better ordering the selling of wines by retail, and for preventing abuses in the mingling, corrupting, and vitiating of wines, and for setting and limiting the prices of the same, ex∣cept so much thereof as related to these abuses: that from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he day of the repeal, which was the fifth of July in the present year, the commission, where∣by agents and commissioners were appointed to grant licences for retailing wine, should cease and determine: that, out of the several duties before mentioned, his majesty should be impowered to grant, during pleasure, to the said several agents or commissioners, and their officers, such yearly al∣lowances as he should think proper, so as not to exceed the present annual amount of their salaries: that, after the determination of the former duties

<P>Towards the supply for the ensuing year the house likewise resolved to apply one million two hundred thousand pounds from the sinking-fund; the savings out of the grants made this session, for the pay of the Hanoverian troops in the service of Great Britain; the surplus of the duties on licences, and of the grants for the preceding year remaining in the Exchequer; and one million to be raised by loans, or Exchequer-bills, to be charged on the first aids granted in the next session of parliament.</P>
<P>Bills being formed on these resolutions, soon passed into laws without opposition.</P>
<P>The sums granted by the committee of supply did not exceed eight millions three hundred fifty thousand three hundred twenty-five pounds nine shillings and three pence: the funds established amounted to eight millions six hundred eighty-nine thousand fifty-one pounds nineteen shillings and seven pence; so that there was an overplus of three hundred thirty▪eight thousand seven hundred and twenty six pounds ten shillings and four pence: an excess which was thought necessary, in case the lottery, which was founded on a new plan, should not succeed.</P>
<P>Some of these impositions were deemed grievous hardships by those upon whom they immediately

To those dependants of the ministry who observed, that as Hanover was threatened by France for its connexion with Great Britain, it ought, in common gratitude, to be protected; they replied, that every state, in assisting an ally, ought to have a regard to its own preservation: that if the king of England enjoyed by inheritance, or succession, a province in the heart of France, it would be equally absurd and unjust, in case of a rupture with that kingdom, to exhaust the trea∣sures of Great Britain in the defence of such a pro∣vince; and yet the inhabitants of it would have the same right to complain, that they suffered for their connexion with England. They observed, that other dominions, electorates, and principali∣ties in Germany, were secured by the constitutions of the Empire, as well as by fair and equal alliances with their co-estates; whereas Hanover stood soli∣tary, like a hunted deer avoided by the herd, and had no other shelter but that of shrinking under the extended shield of Great Britain: that the re∣luctance expressed by the German princes to un∣dertake the defence of these dominions, flowed from a firm persuasion, founded on experience, that England would interpose as a principal, and not

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Messages from the king to the par∣liament.</NOTE> The article of the supply relating to the army of observation, took rise from a message signed by his majesty, and presented by Mr. Pitt, now promoted to the office of principal secretary of state; a gen∣tleman who had, upon sundry occasions, combated the gigantic plan of continental connexions with all the strength of reason, and all the powers of elo∣quence. He now imparted to the house an inti∣mation, importing, It was always with reluctance that his majesty asked extraordinary supplies of his people; but as the united councils, and formidable preparations of France and her allies, threatened Europe in general with the most alarming conse∣quences;
<PB N="425" REF="4400"/>
and as these unjust and vindictive de∣signs<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> were particularly and immediately bent against his majesty's electoral dominions, and those of his good ally the king of Prussia, his majesty confided in the experienced zeal and affection of his faith∣ful commons, that they would chearfully assist him in forming and maintaining an army of observa∣tion, for the just and necessary defence and preser∣vation of those territories, and enable him to fulfil his engagements with his Prussian majesty for the security of the Empire against the irruption of foreign armies, and for the support of the common cause.</P>
<P>Posterity will hardly believe, that the Emperor and all the princes in Germany were in a conspira∣cy against their country, except the king of Prussia, the elector of Hanover, and the landgrave of Hesse Cassel; and they will, no doubt, be surprised, that Great Britain, after all the treaties she had made, and the numberless subsidies she had granted, should not have an ally left, except one prince, so embarrassed in his own affairs, that he could grant her no succour, whatever assistance he might de∣mand.</P>
<P>The king's message met with as favourable a reception as he could have desired. It was read in the house of commons▪ together with a copy of the treaty between his majesty and the king of Prussia, including the secret and separate article, and the declaration signed on each side by the plenipoten∣tiaries at Westminster: the request was granted, and the convention approved. With equal readi∣ness did they gratify his majesty's inclination, sig∣nified in another message delivered, on the seven∣teenth

The committee of supply forth∣with granted a very large sum for these purposes, including the charge of German mercenaries. A like message being at the same time communi∣cated to the upper house, their lordships voted a very loyal address upon the occasion; and when the article of supply, which it produced among the commons, fell under their inspection, they un∣animously agreed to it, by way of a clause of ap∣propriation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures taken to remove the dearth of corn.</NOTE> We have already observed, that the first bill which the commons passed in this session was for the relief of the poor, by prohibiting the exporta∣tion of corn: but this remedy not being judged adequate to the evil, another bill was framed, re∣moving, for a limited time, the duty then payable upon foreign corn and flour imported; as also per∣mitting, for a certain term, all such foreign corn, grain, meal, bread, biscuit, and flour, as had been or should be taken from the enemy, to be landed and expended in the kingdom duty free. In or∣der still more to reduce the high price of corn,
<PB N="427" REF="4420"/>
and to prevent any supply of provisions from being<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> sent to our enemies in America, a third bill was brought in, prohibiting, for a time therein limited, the exportation of corn, grain, meal, malt, flour, bread, biscuit, starch, beef, pork, bacon, or other victual, from any of the British plantations, unless to Great Britain or Ireland, or from one colony to another. To this act, which will remain in force during the continuance of the war, two clauses were added for allowing those necessaries, men∣tioned above, to be imported in foreign built ships, and from any state in amity with his majesty, either into Great Britain or Ireland; and for exporting from Southampton or Exeter to the Isle of Man, for the use of the inhabitants, a quantity of wheat, barley, oats, meal, or flour, not exceeding two thousand five hundred quarters.</P>
<P>The commons would have still improved their humanity, had they contrived and established some effectual method to punish those unfeeling villains, who, by engrossing and hoarding up great quanti∣ties of grain, had created this artificial scarcity, and deprived their fellow-creatures of bread, with a view to their own private advantage. Upon a subsequent report of the committee, the house re∣solved, that, to prevent the high price of wheat and bread, no spirits should be distilled from wheat for a limited time. While the bill, formed on this resolution, was in embryo, a petition was presented to the house by the brewers of London, Westmin∣ster, Southwark, and parts adjacent, representing, that, when the resolution passed, the price of malt, which was before too high, immediately rose to such a degree, that the petitioners found them∣selves
<PB N="428" REF="4430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> utterly incapable of carrying on business, at the price malt then bore, occasioned, as they conceived, from an apprehension of the necessity the distillers would be under to make use of the best pale malt, and substitute the best barley in lieu of wheat: that, in such a case, the markets would not be able to supply a sufficient quantity of barley for the demands of both professions, besides other necessary uses: they therefore prayed, that, in regard to the public revenue, to which the trade of the petitioners so largely contributed, proper measures might be taken for preventing the public loss, and relieving their particular distress. The house would not lend a deaf ear to a remonstrance in which the revenue was concerned. The mem∣bers appointed to prepare the bill, immediately re∣ceived instructions to make provision in it to re∣strain, for a limited time, the distilling of barley, malt, and all grain whatsoever. The bill was framed accordingly; but did not pass without stre∣nuous opposition. To this prohibition it was ob∣jected, that there are always large quantities of wheat and barley in the kingdom so much da∣maged, as to be unfit for any use but the distillery; consequently a restriction of this nature would ruin many farmers▪ and others employed in the trade of malting, Particular interests, however, must often be sacrificed to the welfare of the communi∣ty; and the present distress prevailed over the pro∣spect of this disadvantage. If they had allowed any sort of grain to be distilled, it would have been impossible to prevent the distilling of every kind. The prohibition was limited to two months; but at the expiration of that term, the scarcity still con∣tinuing,
<PB N="429" REF="4440"/>
it was protracted by a new bill to the ele∣venth<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> day of December, with a proviso, impower∣ing his majesty to put an end to it at any time after the eleventh day of May, if such a step should be judged for the advantage of the kingdom. These were but temporary expedients: but the committee, continuing to sit, adopted some other resolutions, which may be productive of more effi∣cacious remedies.</P>
<P>The next bill that engaged the attention of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion for the militia-bill.</NOTE> commons, was a measure of the utmost national importance, though secretly disliked by many in∣dividuals of the legislature, who nevertheless did not venture to avow their disapprobation.

<PB N="437" REF="4520"/>
should be exercised on the Lord's day, commonly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> called Sunday; and praying, that no clause for such purpose might pass into a law. Though nothing could be more ridiculously fanatic and impertinent than the declaration of such a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruple, against a practice so laudable and necessary, in a country where that day of the week is generally spent in merry-making, riot, and debauchery, the house payed so much regard to the squeamish consciences of those puritan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cal petitioners, that Monday was pitched upon for the day of exercise to the militia, though on such working days they might be much more profitably employed, both for themselves and their country; and that no religious pretence should be left for opposing the progress and execu∣tion of the bill, proper clauses were inserted for the relief of the quakers. Another petition and counter-petition were delivered by the magistrates, freeholders, and burgesses of the town of Notting∣ham, in relation to their particular franchises; which were accordingly considered in framing the bill.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Altered by the lords.</NOTE> After mature deliberation, and divers alterations, it passed the lower house, and was sent to the lords for their concurrence: here it underwent several amendments, one of which was the reduction of the number of militia-men to one half of what the commons had proposed; namely, to thirty-two thousand three hundred and forty men, for the whole kingdom of England and Wales. The amendments, being canvassed in the lower house, met with some opposition, and divers conferences with their lordships ensued: at length, however, the two houses agreed to every article, and the
<PB N="438" REF="4530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> bill soon received the royal sanction. No provi∣sion, however, was made for cloaths, arms, accou∣trements and pay: had regulations been made for these purposes, the act would have become a money-bill, in which the lords could have made no amendment: in order therefore to prevent any difference between the two houses, on a dispute of privileges not yet determined, and that the house of peers might make what amendments they should think expedient, the commons left the expence of the militia to be regulated in a subsequent bill, during the following session, when they should with more certainty compute what sum would be necessary for these purposes. After all, the bill seems to be crude, imperfect, and ineffectual; and the promoters of it were well aware of its defects: but they were apprehensive that it would have been dropped altogether, had they insisted upon the scheme's being executed in its full extent. They were eager to seize this opportunity of trying an experiment, which might afterwards be improved to a greater national advantage; and therefore they acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esced in many restrictions and alterations, which otherwise would not have been adopted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> er∣ing the foreign troops.</NOTE> The next measure that fell under the considera∣tion of the house, was rendered necessary by the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣hospitable perseverance of the publicans and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nn∣holders, who conceived themselves not obliged by law to receive or give quarters in their houses to any foreign troops; and accordingly refused admit∣tance to the Hessian auxiliaries, who began to be dreadfully incommoded by the severity of the wea∣ther. This objection implying an attack upon the prerogative, the government did not think fit, at
<PB N="439" REF="4540"/>
this juncture, to dispute any other way than by pro∣curing<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> a new law in favour of those foreigners. It was intituled, a bill to make provision for quarter∣ing the foreign troops now in this kingdom, pre∣pared by lord Barrington, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the solicitor-general, and imme∣mediately passed without opposition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another for the regula∣tion of marine forces, while a∣shore.</NOTE> This step being taken, another bill was brought in for the regulation of marine-forces, while ashore. This was almost a transcript of the mutiny act, with this material difference: it impowered the ad∣miralty to grant commissions for holding general courts-martial, and to do every thing, and in the same manner, as his majesty is impowered to do by the usual mutiny bill; consequently every clause was adopted without question.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A third for the more speedy and effec∣tual re∣cruiting his majes∣ty's land∣forces and marines.</NOTE> The same favourable reception was given to a bill for the more speedy and effectual recruiting his majesty's land▪forces and marines; a law which threw into the hands of many worthless magistrates an additional power of oppressing their fellow∣creatures: all justices of the peace, commissioners for the land-tax, magistrates of corporations and boroughs, were impowered to meet by direction of the secretary at war, communicated in precepts issued by the high sheriffs, or their deputies, within their respective divisions, and at their usual place of meeting, to qualify themselves for the execution of the act: then they were required to appoint the times and places for their succeeding meetings; to issue precepts to the proper officers for these suc∣ceeding meetings; to give notice of the time and place of every meeting to such military officer, as, by notice from the secretary at war, should be di∣rected
<PB N="440" REF="4550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> to attend that service. At these meetings the commissioners were impowered to receive all such men as should voluntarily offer to inlist in his majesty's service on or before the first day of May; and, upon their being approved by the military of∣ficer attending, to gratify each volunteer with a bounty of three pounds, to be payed by the re∣ceiver-general or collector of the land-tax out of the money in his hands; such being the condition of his inlisting, that after having served three years, if the war should then be ended, otherwise at the end of the war, he should be intitled to his dis∣charge. They were also impowered to impress into the service all able-bodied, idle, and disorderly per∣sons, who did not exercise and industriously prose∣cute some lawful occupation, or had not substance sufficient for their own maintenance. For this pur∣pose they were vested with power to make search for and apprehend all such persons as should ap∣pear to be within the description of the act: even church-wardens, and other parish and town-officers, partook of this power, without deriving any autho∣rity from the commissioners; and it ordained, that all men so apprehended, adjudged by the commissioners, at their next meeting, to be within the description of the act, if approved by the military officer in atten∣dance, should be delivered over to the said officer, who should pay twenty shillings, or, if such im∣pressed man had a wife or family, a sum not ex∣ceeding forty shillings, to be applied to the use of the parish; unless there was an informer, who, in that case, would be intitled to ten shillings of the money. The act prescribed, that none should be impressed but able-bodied men, free from ruptures
<PB N="441" REF="4560"/>
or bodily infirmity, not a reputed papist, nor under<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the size of five feet four inches, or short of seven∣teen years of age, or turned of five and forty, or possessed of a vote in the election of a member to serve in parliament for any place in Great Britain. A person, thus impressed, was, at the end of five years, or termination of the war, intitled to his dis∣charge: but no private soldier, duly inlisted by this act, might, during the time he should remain in Great Britain, be discharged without the consent of the colonel, or field-officer commanding the regi∣ment, in writing under his hand and seal; or, if a marine, without the consent of the admiralty; the officer, discharging him in any other manner, be∣ing liable to be cashiered. The bounty-money ad∣vanced by the commissioners of the land-tax, was ordered to be repayed into the Exchequer by the respective paymasters of the forces; and the time of the bill's continuing in force was limited to the end of the next session of parliament; such a short term being prescribed for volunteers to en er, be∣cause it was necessary to complete the regiments by the first of May; and the legislature rightly judged that such a limitation would induce all those that might think themselves in danger of being im∣pressed to enter voluntarily before that day, in or∣der to intitle themselves to the bounty granted by parliament.</P>
<P>The annual bill for preventing mutiny and de∣sertion met with no objections, and indeed con∣tained nothing essentially different from that which had passed in the last session.</P>

By this bill a penalty was inflicted on pawnbrokers, in a summary way, for receiving goods, knowing them not to be the property of the pledger, and pawned without the authority of the owner. It was enacted, that persons pawning, exchanging, or disposing of goods, without leave of the owner, should suffer in the penalty of twenty shillings; and, on non▪payment, be committed for fourteen days to hard labour; afterwards, if the money could not then be payed, be whipped publicly in the house of correction, or such other place as the justice of peace should appoint, on publication of the prosecutor: that every pawnbroker should make entry of the person's name and place of abode who pledges any goods with him; and the pledger, if he required it, should have a duplicate of that entry: that a pawnbroker, receiving linne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or apparel intrusted to others to be washed or mended, should forfeit double the sum lent upon it, and restore the goods: that upon oath of any person whose goods are unlawfully pawned or ex∣changed, the justice should issue a warrant to search the suspected person's house; and, upon refusal of admittance, the officer might break open the door: that goods pawned for any sum not exceeding ten pounds, might be recovered within two years, the owner making oath of the pawning, and tendering the principal, interest, and charges: that goods re∣maining unredeemed for two years, should be for∣feited and sold, the overplus to be accounted for to the owner on demand.</P>

It likewise imported, that all contracts or agreements made between clothiers and weavers, in respect to wages, should, from and after the first of May, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, be valid, notwithstanding any rate established, or to be established: but that these contracts or agree∣ments should extend only to the actual prices or rates of workmanships or wages, and not the pay∣ment thereof in any other manner than in money: and that if any clothier should refuse or neglect to pay the weaver the wages or price agreed on, in money, within two days after the work should be performed and delivered, the same being de∣manded,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to the im∣prove∣ment of the British fishery.</NOTE> The commons were not more forward to pro∣vide supplies for prosecuting the war with vigour, than ready to adopt new regulations for the ad∣vantage of trade and manufacture. The society of the free British fishery presented a petition, al∣ledging, that they had employed the sum of one hundred thirty thousand three hundred and five pounds eight sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ings and six pence, together with the intire produce of their fish, and all the moneys arising from the several branches allowed on the tonnage of their shipping, and on the ex∣portation of their fish, in carrying on the said fishe∣ry; and that, from their being obliged, in the in∣fancy of the undertaking, to incur a much larger expence than was at that time foreseen, they now found themselves so far reduced in their capital, as to be utterly incapable of further prosecuting the fisheries with any hope of success, unless indulged with the further assistance of parliament. They prayed therefore, that, towards enabling them to carry on the said fisheries, they might have liberty to make use of such nets as they should find best adapted to the said fisheries; each buss, neverthe∣less, carrying to sea the same quantity and depth of netting, which, by the fishery acts, they were then bound to carry: that the bounty of thirty shillings per ton, allowed by the said acts on the vessels em∣ployed in the fishery, might be increased; and for as much as many of the stock▪proprietors were un∣able to advance any further sum for prosecuting this branch of commerce, and others unwilling, in the present situation, and under the present re∣straints,
<PB N="445" REF="4600"/>
to risque any further sum in the under∣taking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> that the stock of the society, by the said acts made unalienable, except in case of death or bankruptcy, for a term of years, might forthwith be made transferable; and that the petitioners might be at liberty, between the intervals of the fishing seasons, to employ the busses in such a man∣ner as they should find for the advantage of the society. While the committee was employed in deliberating on the particulars of this remonstrance, another was delivered from the free British fishery-chamber of Whitehaven in Cumberland, repre∣senting, that, as the law then stood, they went to Shetland, and returned at a great expence and loss of time; and, while the war continued, durst not stay there to fish, besides being obliged to run the most imminent risques by going and returning without convoy: that, ever since the institution of the present fishery, experience had fully shewn the fishery of Shetland not worth following, as thereby the petitioners had lost two months of a much bet∣ter fishery in St. George's channel, within one day's sail of Whitehaven: they took notice, that the free British fishery society had applied to the house for further assistance and relief; and prayed that Camp∣bel-town in Argyleshire might be appointed the place of rendezvous for the busses belonging to Whitehaven for the summer, as well as the winter fishery, that they might be enabled to fish with greater advantage. The committee, having con∣sidered the matter of both petitions, were of opi∣nion, that the petitioners should be at liberty to use such nets as they should find best adapted to the white herring fishery: that the bounty of thirty
<PB N="446" REF="4610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> shillings per ton, should be augmented to fifty: that the petitioners should be allowed, during the intervals of the fishing seasons, to employ their vessels in any other lawful business, provided they shall have been employed in herring fishing, dur∣ing the proper seasons: that they might use such barrels for packing the fish as they then used, or might thereafter find best adapted for that pur∣pose: that they should have liberty to make use of any waste or uncultivated land, one hundred yards at the least, above high water mark, for the purpose of drying their nets; and that Campbel-town would be the most proper and convenient place for the rendezvous of the busses belonging to Whitehaven. This last resolution, however, was not inserted in the bill which contained the other five, and in a little time received the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for importing American iron, duty free.</NOTE> Such are the connexions, dependencies, and re∣lations subsisting between the mechanical arts, agriculture, and manufactures of Great Britain, that it requires study, deliberation, and enquiry in the legislature to discern and distinguish the whole scope and consequences of many projects offered for the benefit of the commonwealth. The society of merchant adventurers in the city of Bristol, al∣ledged, in a petition to the house of commons, that great quantities of bar iron were imported into Great Britain from Sweden, Russia, and other parts, chiefly purchased with ready money, some of which iron was exported again to Africa and other places; and the rest wrought up by the ma∣nufacturers. They affirmed that bar iron, im∣ported from North America, would answer the same purposes; and the importation of it tend not
<PB N="447" REF="4620"/>
only to the great advantage of the kingdom, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> increasing its shipping and navigation; but also to the benefit of the British colonies: that, by an act passed in the twenty third year of his present majesty's reign, the importation of bar iron from America into the port of London duty free, was permitted: but its being carried coastways, or farther by land than ten miles, had been prohi∣bited; so that several very considerable manufac∣turing towns were deprived of the use of American iron, and the out-ports prevented from employ∣ing it in their export commerce: they requested, therefore, that bar iron might be imported from North America into Great Britain, duty free, by all his majesty's subjects. This request being re∣inforced by many other petitions from different parts of the kingdom, other classes of men, who thought their several interests would be affected by such a measure, took the alarm; and, in divers counter petitions, specified many ill consequences which they alledged would arise from its being enacted into a law. Pamphlets were published on both sides of the question, and violent disputes were kindled upon this subject, which was justly deemed a matter of national importance. The opposers of the bill observed, that large quantities of iron were yearly produced at home, and em∣ployed multitudes of poor people, there being no less than one hundred and nine forges in England and Wales, besides those erected in Scotland, the whole producing eighteen thousand tons of iron: that as the mines in Great Britain are inexhaustible, the produce would of late years have been consider∣ably increased, had not the people been kept
<PB N="448" REF="4630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> under continual apprehension of seeing American iron admitted duty free: a supposition which had prevented the traders from extending their works, and discouraged many from engaging in this branch of traffic: they alledged that the iron works already carried on in England, occasioned a consumption of one hundred and ninety-eight thousand cords of wood, produced in coppices that grow upon barren lands, which could not other∣wise be turned to any good account: that as the coppices afford shade, and preserve a moisture in the ground, the pasture is more valuable with the wood, than it would be if the coppices were grub∣bed up; consequently all the estates where these now grow would sink in their yearly value: that these coppices now cultivated and preserved for the use of the iron works, are likewise absolutely ne∣cessary for the manufacture of leather, as they fur∣nish bark for the tanners; and that, according to the management of these coppices, they produced a great number of timber trees so necessary for the purposes of building. They asserted, that neither the American iron, nor any that had yet been found in Great Britain, was so proper for convert∣ing into Steel, as that which comes from Sweden, particularly that sort called, ore ground; but as there are mines in the northern parts of Britain, nearly in the same latitude with those of Sweden, furnished with sufficient quantities of wood, and rivers for mills and engines, it was hardly to be doubted but that people would find metal of the same quality, and, in a few years, be able to pre∣vent the necessity of importing iron either from Sweden or Russia. They inferred, that American
<PB N="449" REF="4640"/>
iron could never interfere with that which Great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Britain imported from Sweden, because it was not fit for edge-tools, anchors, chain-plates, and other particulars necessary in ship-building; nor dimi∣nish the importation of Russia iron, which was not only harder than the American and British, but also could be afforded cheaper than that brought from our own plantations, even though the duty of this last should be removed. The importation of American iron, therefore, duty free, could in∣terfere with no other sort but that produced in Britain, with which, by means of this advantage, it would clash so much, as to put a stop in a little time to all the iron works now carried on in the kingdom, and reduce to beggary a great number of families whom they support. To these objec∣tions the favourers of the bill sollicited, replied, that when a manufacture is much more valuable than the rough materials, and these cannot be pro∣duced at home in sufficient quantities, and at such a price as is consistent with the preservation of the manufacture, it is the interest of the legislature to admit a free importation of these materials, even from foreign countries, although it should put an end to the production of that material in this island: that as the neighbours of Great Britain are now more attentive than ever to their commercial interests, and endeavouring to manufacture their rough materials at home, this nation must take every method for lowering the price of materials, otherwise in a few years it will lose the manufac∣ture; and, instead of supplying other countries, be furnished by them with all the fine toys and utensils made of steel and iron: that being in danger of
<PB N="450" REF="4650"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> losing not only the manufacture but the produce of iron, unless it can be procured at a cheaper rate than that for which it is sold at present; the only way of attaining this end, is by diminishing the duty payable upon the importation of foreign iron, or by rendering it necessary for the undertakers of the iron mines in Great Britain to sell their pro∣duce cheaper than it has been for some years af∣forded: that the most effectual method for this pur∣pose is to raise up a rival, by permitting a free im∣portation of all sorrs of iron from the American plantations: that American iron can never be sold so cheap as that of Britain can be afforded; for, in the colonies, labour of all kinds is much dearer than in England: if a man employs his own slaves, he must reckon in his charge a great deal more than the common interest of their purchase money, because when one of them dies or escapes from his master, he loses both interest and princi∣pal: that the common interest of money in the plantations is considerably higher than in England, consequently no man in that country will employ his money in any branch of trade by which he can∣not gain considerably more per centum than is ex∣pected in Great Britain, where the interest is low, and profit moderate; a circumstance which will always give a great advantage to the British miner, who likewise enjoys an exemption from freight and insurance, which lie heavy upon the American ad∣venturer, especially in time of war. With respect to the apprehension of the leather tanners, they observed, that as the coppices generally grew on barren lands, not fit for tillage, and improved the pasturage, no proprietor would be at the expence
<PB N="451" REF="4660"/>
of grubbing up the wood to spoil the pasture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> as he could make no other use of the land on which it was produced. The wood must be always worth something, especially in counties where there is not plenty of coal, and the timber trees would produce considerable advantage: therefore, if there was not one iron mine in Great Britain, no coppices would be grubbed up, unless it grew on a rich soil which would produce corn instead of cord∣wood; consequently the tanners have nothing to fear, especially as planting hath become a prevail∣ing taste among the landholders of the island. The committee appointed to prepare the bill, se∣riously weighed and canvassed these arguments, examined disputed facts, and inspected papers and accounts relating to the produce, importation, and manufactory of iron. At length Mr. John Pitt reported to the house their opinion, implying that the liberty granted by an act passed in the twenty-third year of his majesty's reign, of impor∣ing bar-iron from the British colonies in America into the port of London, should be extended to all the other ports of Great Britain; and that so much of that act as related to this clause, should be re∣pealed. The house having agreed to these resolu∣tions, and the bill being brought in accordingly, another petition was presented by several noblemen, gentlemen, freeholders, and other proprietors, owners, and possessors of coppices and woodlands in the west-riding of Yorkshire, alledging that a permission to import American bar-iron duty free, would be attended with numberless ill consequences both of a public and private nature; specifying certain hardships to which they in particular would
<PB N="452" REF="4670"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> be exposed; and praying, that if the bill should pass, they might be relieved from the pressure of an act passed in the reign of Henry VIII. obliging the owners of coppice-woods to preserve them, under severe penalties; and be permitted to sell and grub up their coppice-woods, in order to a more proper cultivation of the soil, without being restrained by the fear of malicious and interested prosecutions. In consequence of this remon∣strance, a clause was added to the bill, repealing so much of the act of Henry the Eighth as pro∣hibited the conversion of coppice or underwoods into pasture or tillage; then it passed through both houses, and received the royal sanction. As there was not time, after this affair came upon the carpet, to obtain any new account from America, and as it was thought necessary to know the quan∣tities of iron made in that country, the house pre∣sented an address to his majesty, desiring he would be pleased to give directions, that there should be laid before them, in the next session of parliament, an account of the quantity of iron made in the American colonies, from Christmas in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-nine, to the fifth day of January, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, each year being distin∣guished.</P>
<P>From this important object, the parliament con∣verted its attention to a regulation of a much more private nature. In consequence of a petition by the lord mayor, aidermen, and commons of the city of London, a bill was brought in, and passed into a law without opposition, for the more effec∣tual preservation and improvement of the fry and
<PB N="453" REF="4680"/>
spawn of fish in the river Thames, and waters of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Medway, and for the better regulating the fishery in these rivers. The two next measures taken for the benefit of the public were, first, a bill to ren∣der more effectual the several laws then in being, for the amendment and preservation of the high∣ways and turnpike roads of the kingdom; the other for the more effectually preventing the spreading of the contagious distemper which at that time raged among the horned cattle. A third arose from the distress of poor silk manufacturers, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regula∣tions with respect to the im∣portation of silk.</NOTE> were destitute of employment, and deprived of all means of subsisting through the interruption of the Levant trade, occasioned by the war, and the de∣lay of the merchant ships from Italy. In order to remedy this inconvenience, a bill was prepared, enacting that any persons might import from any place, in any ship or vessel whatsoever, till the first day of December, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, organzine thrown silk of the growth or production of Italy, to be brought to the custom∣house of London, wheresoever landed: but that no Italian thrown silk, coarser than Bologna, nor any tram of the growth of Italy; nor any other thrown silk of the growth or production of Tur∣key, Persia, East-India, or China, should be im∣ported by this act, under the penalty of the for∣feiture thereof. Notwithstanding several petitions presented by the merchants, owners and comman∣ders of ships, and others trading to Leghorn, and other ports of Italy; as well as by the importers and manufacturers of raw silks, representing evil conse∣quences that would probably attend the passing of such a bill, the parliament agreed to this tempo∣rary

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> deviation from the famous act of navigation, for a present supply to the poor manufacturers; and perhaps it would be for the interest of the community, at the beginning of every war, to suspend this act with respect to foreign ships and foreign seamen, fo far as it relates to the impor∣tation of those rough materials that are necessary for the British manufactures.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Encou∣ragement to smug∣glers to enlist in his majes∣ty's ser∣vice.</NOTE> The next civil regulation established in this session of parliament, was in itself judicious, and, had it been more early suggested, might have been much more beneficial to the public. In or∣der to discourage the practice of smuggling, and prevent the desperadoes therein concerned from enlisting in the service of the enemy, a law was passed, enacting, that every person who had been, before the first of May in the present year, guilty of illegal running, concealing, receiving, or carry∣ing any wool, or prohibited goods, or any foreign commodities liable to duties, the same not having been payed or secured; or of aiding therein, or had been found with fire-arms or weapons, in order to be aiding to such offenders; or had been guilty of receiving such goods after seizure; or of any act whatsoever, whereby persons might be deemed runners of foreign goods; or of hindering, wound∣ing, or beating any officer in the execution of his duty, or assisting therein, should be indemnified from all such offences, concerning which, no suit should then have been commenced, or composition made, on condition that he should, before being apprehended, or prosecuted, and before the first day of December, enter himself with some commis∣sioned officer of his majesty's fleet, to serve as a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts in parlia∣ment that miscar∣ried.</NOTE> An attempt was made in favour of the seamen employed in the navy, who had been very irregu∣larly payed, and subject to grievous hardships in consequence of this irregularity. Mr. Greenville, brother to earl Temple, moved for leave to bring in a bill for the encouragement of seamen em∣ployed in his majesty's navy, and for establishing a regular method for the punctual, speedy, and certain payment of their wages, as well as for res∣cuing them from the arts of fraud and imposition. The proposal was corroborated by divers petitions: the bill was prepared, read, printed, and, after it had undergone some amendment, passed into the house of lords, where it was encountered with se∣veral objections, and dropped for this session of parliament. The other designs which miscarried in the same manner were these: a bill for enlarging the terms and powers granted and continued by several acts of parliament, for repairing the har∣bour of Dover in Kent, and for restoring the har∣bour of Rye in Sussex to its antient goodness. A bill to continue an act, made in the sixth year of his present majesty's reign, for the better regulat∣ing of lastage and ballastage in the river Thames. A bill to restrain and limit the vending and dispos∣sing of poisons; and a bill regulating the manner of licensing alehouses in cities and towns corporate within the kingdom of England.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> The house of commons being desirous of pre∣venting, for the future such distresses as the poor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into the causes of the scar∣city of corn.</NOTE> had lately undergone, appointed a committee to consider of proper provisions to restrain the price of corn and bread within due bounds for the fu∣ture. For this purpose they were impowered to send for persons, papers, and records; and it was resolved that all who attended the committee should have voices. Having inquired into the causes of the late scarcity, they agreed to several resolutions, and a bill was brought in to explain and amend the laws against regrators, forestallers, and engrossers of corn. The committee also re∣ceived instructions to inquire into the abuses of millers, mealmen, and bakers, with regard to bread, and to consider of proper methods to pre∣vent them in the sequel; but no further progress was made in this important affair, which was the more interesting, as the lives of individuals, in a great measure, depended upon a speedy reforma∣tion: for the millers and bakers were said to have adulterated their flour with common whiting, lime, bone-ashes, allum, and other ingredients pernici∣ous to the human constitution; a consummation of villainy for which no adequate punishment could be inflicted. Among the measures proposed in parliament which did not succeed, one of the most remarkable was a bill prepared by Mr. Rose Fuller, Mr. Charles Townshend, and Mr. Banks, to ex∣plain, amend, and render more effectual a law passed in the reign of king William the Third, intituled, "An act to punish governors of planta∣tions, in this kingdom, for crimes committed by them in the plantations." This bill was proposed
<PB N="457" REF="4720"/>
in consequence of some complaints specifying acts<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757</NOTE> of cruelty, folly, and oppression, by which some British governors had been lately distinguished; but before the bill could be brought in, the parlia∣ment was prorogued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into the loss of Minorca.</NOTE> But no step taken by the house of commons, in the course of this session, was more interesting to the body of the people, than the inquiry into the loss of Minorca, which had excited such loud and universal clamour. By addresses to the king, una∣nimously voted, the commons requested that his majesty would give directions for laying before them copies of all the letters and papers, con∣taining any intelligence received by the secretaries of state, the commissioners of the admiralty, or any others of his majesty's ministers, in relation to the equipment of the French fleet at Toulon, or the designs of the French on Minorca, or any other of his majesty's possessions in Europe, since the first day of January, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, to the first day of last Au∣gust. They likewise desired to peruse a list of the ships of war that were equipped and made ready for sea, from the first of August, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, to the thir∣tieth day of April in the following year; with the copies of all sailing orders sent to the commanders during that period: as also the state and condition of his majesty's ships in the several ports of Great Britain, at the time of admiral Byng's departure, with the squadron under his command, for the re∣lief of Fort St. Philip, during this period of time above-mentioned, according to the monthly re∣turns made to the admiralty, with the number of
<PB N="458" REF="4730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> seamen mustered and borne on board the respec∣tive ships. They demanded copies of all orders and instructions given to that admiral, and of let∣ters written to and received from him, during his continuance in that command, either by the secre∣taries of state, or lords of the admiralty, relating to the condition of his squadron, and to the exe∣cution of his orders. In a word, they required the inspection of all papers which could, in any man∣ner, tend to explain the loss of Minorca, and the miscarriage of Mr. Byng's squadron. His majesty complied with every article of their requests: the papers were presented to the house, ordered to lie upon the table for the perusal of the members, and finally referred to the consideration of a committee of the who'e house.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflec∣tions on this me∣thod of proceed∣ing.</NOTE> In the course of their deliberations they ad∣dressed his majesty for more information, till at length the truth seemed to be smothered under such an enormous burthen of papers, as the efforts of a whole session could not have properly removed. Indeed many discerning persons, without doors, began to despair of seeing the mystery unfolded, as soon as the inquiry was undertaken by a com∣mittee of the whole house. They observed that an affair of such a dark, intricate, and suspicious nature, ought to have been referred to a select and secret committee, chosen by ballot, impowered to send for persons, papers, and records; and to exa∣mine witnesses in the most solemn and deliberate manner: that the names of the committee ought to have been published for the satisfaction of the people, who could have judged with some cer∣tainty whether the inquiry would be carried on
<PB N="459" REF="4740"/>
with such impartiality as the national misfortune<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757▪</NOTE> required. They suspected that this reference to a committee of the whole house, was a m—l con∣trivance to prevent a regular and minute investi∣gation; to introduce confusion and contest; to puzzle, perplex, and ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrate; to teaze, fa∣tigue, and disgust the inquirers, that the exami∣nation might be hurried over in a superficial and perfunctory manner; and the m—y, from this anarchy and confusion of materials, half explored and undigested, derive a general parliamentary ap∣probation, to which they might appeal from the accusations of the people. A select committee would have probably examined some of the clerks of the respective offices, that they might certainly know whether any letters or papers had been sup∣pressed; whether the extracts had been faithfully made; and whether there might not be papers of intelligence, which, tho' proper to be submitted to a select and secret committee, could not consistently with the honour of the nation, be communicated to a committee of the whole house. Indeed it does not appear that the m—rs had any foreign intelli∣gence or correspondents that could be much de∣pended upon, in any matter of national impor∣tance; and no evidence was examined on this oc∣casion: a circumstance the less to be regretted, as in times past evil ministers have generally found means to render such inquiries ineffectual; and the same arts would, at any rate, have operated with the same efficacy, had a secret committee been employed at this juncture.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, several resolutions were re∣ported from the committee, though some of them
<PB N="460" REF="4750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> were not carried by the majority without violent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolu∣tions of the com∣mittee; and re∣marks on these reso∣lutions.</NOTE> dispute and severe altercation. The first and last of their resolutions require particular notice.</P>
<P>By the former it appeared to the committee, that his majesty, from the twenty-seventh day of Au∣gust, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, to the twentieth day of April in the suc∣ceeding year, received such repeated and concur∣rent intelligence, as gave just reason to believe that the French king intended to invade his domi∣nions of Great Britain or Ireland.</P>
<P>In the latter they declared their opinion, that no greater number of ships of war could be sent into the Mediterranean, than were actually sent thither under the command of admiral Byng; nor any greater reinforcement than the regiment which was sent, and the detachment, equal to a battalion, which was ordered to the relief of Fort St. Philip, consistently with the state of the navy, and the va∣rious services essential to the safety of his majesty's dominions, and the interests of his subjects.</P>
<P>It must have been something more powerful than ordinary conviction that suggested these opi∣nions. Whatever reports might have been circu∣lated by the French ministry, in order to amuse, intimidate, and detach the attention of the English government from America and the Mediterranean, where they really intended to exert themselves; yet the circumstances of the two nations being con∣sidered, one would think there could have been no just grounds to f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar an invasion of Great Britain or Ireland, especially when other intelligence seemed to point out much more probable scenes of action. But the last resolution is still more incomprehen∣sible
<PB N="461" REF="4760"/>
to those who know not exactly the basis on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757▪</NOTE> which it was raised. The number of ships of war in actual commission, amounted to two hundred and fifty, having on board fifty thousand seamen and marines. Intelligence and repeated information of the French design upon Minorca had been con∣veyed to the m—y of England, about six months before it was put in execution. Is it credible, that in all this time the nation could not equip or spare above eleven ships of the line and six frigates, to save the important island of Minorca? Is it easy to conceive, that from a standing army of fifty thou∣sand men, one regiment of troops could not have been detached to reinforce a garrison, well known to be insufficient for the works it was destined to defend? To persons of common intellects it ap∣peared, that intelligence of the armament at Tou∣lon was conveyed to the admiralty as early as the month of September, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, with express notice that it would consist of twelve ships of the line; that the design against Minorca was communicated as early as the twenty-seventh day of August, by consul Banks of Carthagena; confirmed by letters from consul Berttes at Genoa, dated on the seven∣teenth and twenty-sixth of January, and received by Mr. Fox, secretary of state, on the fourth and eleventh of February; as well as by many subse∣quent intimations; that, notwithstanding these re∣peated advices, even after hostilities had com∣menced in Europe, when the garrison of Minorca amounted to no more than four incomplete regi∣ments, and one company of artillery, forty▪two officers being absent, and the place otherwise
<PB N="462" REF="4770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> unprovided for a siege; when the Mediterranean squadron, commanded by Mr. Edgecumbe, con∣sisted of two ships of the line, and five frigates; neither stores, ammunition, or provision, the absent officers belonging to the garrison, recruits for the regiments, through ready raised, miners, nor any additional troops, were sent to the island; nor the squadron augmented, till admiral Byng sailed from Spithead on the sixth day of April, with no more ships of the line than, by the most early and au∣thentic intelligence, the government were informed would sail from Toulon, even when Mr. Byng should have been joined by commodore Edge∣cumbe; a junction upon which no dependance ought to have been laid: that this squadron con∣tained no troops but such as belonged to the four regiments in garrison, except one battalion to serve in the fleet as marines, unless we include the order for another to be embarked at Gibraltar, which order was neither obeyed nor understood: that considering the danger to which Minorca was ex∣posed, and the forwardness of the enemy's prepa∣rations at Toulon, admiral Osborne, with thirteen ships of the line and one frigate, who returned on the sixteenth of February, after having convoyed a fleet of merchant-ships, might have been detached to Minorca, without hazarding the coast of Great Britain; for at that time, exclusive of this squa∣dron, there were eight ships of the line and thirty-two frigates ready manned, and thirty-two ships of the line and five frigates almost equipped: that admiral Hawke was sent with fourteen ships of the line and one frigate to cruize in the bay of Biscay, after repeated intelligence had been received that
<PB N="463" REF="4780"/>
the French fleet had sailed for the West Indies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and the eleven ships remaining at Brest and Roch∣fort were in want of hands and cannon, so that they could never serve to cover any embarkation or descent; consequently Mr. Hawke's squadron might have been spared for the relief of Minorca: that instead of attending to this important object, the admiralty, on the eighth day of March, sent two ships of the line and three frigates to intercept a coasting convoy off Cape Barfleur: on the eleventh of the same month they detached two ships of the line to the West Indies; and on the nineteenth two more to North America, where they could be of little immediate service: on the twenty-third two of the line and three frigates a convoy-hunting off Cherburg; and on the first of April five ships of the line, including three returned from this last ser∣vice, to reinforce Sir Edward Hawke, already too strong for the French fleet bound to Canada: that all these ships might have been added to Mr. Byng's squadron, without exposing Great Britain or Ireland to any hazard of invasion: that at length Mr. Byng was detached with ten great ships only, and even denied a frigate to repeat signals, for which he petitioned; although at that very time there were in port, exclusive of his squadron, seven∣teen ships of the line and thirteen frigates ready for sea, besides eleven of the line and nineteen frigates almost equipped. From these and other circumstances, particularised and urged with great vivacity, many individuals inferred, that a greater number of ships might have been detached to the Mediterranean that were actually sent with admiral Byng: that the not sending an earlier and stronger
<PB N="464" REF="4790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> force was one great cause of Minorca's being lost, and co-operated with the delay of the m—y, in sending thither reinforcements of troops, their ne∣glect in suffering the officers of the garrison to continue absent from their duty, and their omit∣ting to give orders for raising miners to serve in the fortress of Mahon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Examina∣tion of the American contract.</NOTE> The next inquiry in which the house of com∣mons engaged▪ related to the contracts for victual∣ling the forces in America, which were supposed by some patriots to be fraudulent and unconscion∣able. This suspicion arose from an ambiguous expression, on which the contractor being interro∣gated by the committee, appointed to examine the particulars, he prudently interpreted it in such a manner as to screen himself from the resentment of the legislature. The house therefore resolved, that the contract entered into on the twenty-sixth day of March, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, by the commissioners of the treasury, with William Baker, Christopher Kilby, and Richard Baker, of London, merchants, for furnishing pro∣visions to the forces under the command of the earl of Loudon, was prudent and necessary, and properly adapted to the securing a constant and ef∣fectual supply for those forces in America.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into the conduct of admiral Knowles, governor of Jamai∣ca.</NOTE> In the preceding session an address had been presented to the king by the house of commons, desiring his majesty would give orders for laying before them several papers relating to disputes which had lately happened between his excellency Charles Knowles, Esq; and some of the principal inhabitants of the island of Jamaica. This gover∣nor was accused of many illegal, cruel, and arbi∣trary
<PB N="465" REF="4800"/>
acts, during the course of his arbitration:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757▪</NOTE> but these imputations he incurred by an exertion of power, which was in itself laudable, and well intended for the commercial interest of the island. This was his changing the seat of government, and procuring an act of assembly for removing the several laws, records, books, papers, and writings belonging to several offices in that island, from Spanish-town to Kingston; and for obliging the several officers to keep their offices, and hold a supreme court of judicature, at this last place, to which he had moved the seat of government.</P>
<P>Spanish-town, otherwise called St. Jago de la Vega, the old capital, was an inconsiderable inland place of no security, trade, or importance; where∣as Kingston was the center of commerce, situated on the side of a fine harbour filled with ships, well secured from the insults of an enemy, large, weal∣thy, and flourishing. Here the merchants dwell, and ship the greatest part of the sugars that grow upon the island. They found it extremely incon∣venient and expensive to take out their clearances at Spanish-town, which stands at a considerable dis∣tance; and the same inconvenience and expence being felt by the rest of the inhabitants, who had occasion to prosecute suits at law, or attend the as∣sembly of the island, they joined in representations to the governor, requesting, that, in consideration of these inconveniences, added to that of the weak∣ness of Spanish town and the importance of King∣ston, the seat of government might be removed. He complied with their request, and in so doing intailed upon himself the hatred and resentment of certain powerful planters, who possessed estates in
<PB N="466" REF="4810"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and about the old town of St. Jago de la Vega, thus deserted. This seems to have been the real source of the animosity and clamour incurred by Mr. Knowles, against whom a petition, signed by nineteen members of the assembly, had been sent to England, and presented to his majesty.</P>
<P>In the two sessions preceding this year, the affair had been brought into the house of commons, where this governor's character was painted in frightful colours, and divers papers relating to the dispute were examined. Mr. Knowles having by this time returned to England, the subject of his administration was revived, and referred to a com∣mittee of the whole house.</P>
<P>In the mean time petitions were presented by several merchants of London and Liverpool, con∣cerned in the trade to Jamaica, alledging, that the removal of the public courts, offices, and records of the island of Jamaica to Kingston, and fixing the seat of government there, had been productive of many important advantages, by rendering the strength of the island more formidable, the pro∣perty of the traders and inhabitants more secure, and the prosecution of all commercial business more expeditious and less expensive than formerly; therefore praying, that the purposes of the act, passed in Jamaica for that end might be carried into effectual execution, in such manner as the house should think proper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolu∣tions of the com∣mons on this sub∣ject.</NOTE> The committee, having examined a great num∣ber of papers, agreed to some resolutions, import∣ing, that a certain resolution of the assembly of Ja∣maica, dated on the twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three,
<PB N="467" REF="4820"/>
implying a claim of right in that assembly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> to raise and apply public money without the con∣sent of the governor and council; was illegal, re∣pugnant to the terms of his majesty's commission to his governor of the said island, and derogatory of the rights of the crown and people of Great Bri∣tain: that the six last resolutions taken in the as∣sembly of Jamaica, on the twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-three, proceeded on a manifest misappre∣hension of the king's instructions to his governor, requiring him not to give his assent to any bill of an unusual or extraordinary nature and importance, wherein his majesty's prerogative, or the property of his subjects, might be prejudiced, or the trade or shipping of the kingdom any ways affected, un∣less there should be a clause inserted, suspending the execution of such bill until his majesty's plea∣sure should be known; that such instruction was just and necessary, and no alteration of the consti∣tution of the island, nor any way derogatory to the rights of the subjects in Jamaica. From these re∣solutions the reader may perceive the nature of the dispute, which had arisen between the people of Jamaica and their governor, vice admiral Knowles, whose conduct on this occasion seems to have been justified by the legislature. The parliament, how∣ever, forbore to determine the question, whether the removal of the courts of judicature from Spa∣nish-town to Kingston was a measure calculated for the interest of the island in general.</P>
<P>The last subject which we shall mention, as having fallen under the cognizance of the commons during the session of parliament, was the state of
<PB N="468" REF="4830"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Milford-haven on the coast of Wales, one of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolu∣tions con∣cerning Milford-haven.</NOTE> most capacious, safe, and commodious harbours in Great Britain. Here the country affords many conveniencies for building ships of war, and erect∣ing forts, docks, quays, and magazines. It might be fortified at a very small expence, so as to be quite secure from any attempts of the enemy, and rendered by far the most useful harbour in the kingdom for fleets, cruisers, trading ships, and packet-boats, bound to and from the westward; for from hence they may put to sea almost with any wind, and even at low water: they may wea∣ther Scilly and Cape Clear when no vessel can stir from the British channel, or out of the French ports of Brest and Rochfort; and as a post can travel from hence in three days to London, it might be∣come the center of very useful sea intelligence. A petition from several merchants in London, was pre∣sented, and recommended to the house in a mes∣sage from the king, specifying the advantages of this harbour, and the small expence at which it might be fortified; and praying that the house would take this important subject into considera∣tion. Accordingly a committee was appointed for this purpose, with power to send for persons, pa∣pers, and records; and every circumstance relating to it was examined with accuracy and deliberation. At length, the report being made to the house by Mr. Charles Townshend, they unanimously agreed to an address, representing to his majesty, that many great losses had been sustained by the trade of the kingdom, in time of war, from the want of a safe harbour on the western coast of the island, for the reception and protection of merchant ships,
<PB N="469" REF="4840"/>
and sending out cruisers: that the harbour of Mil∣ford<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> haven, in the county of Pembroke, is most advantageously situated, and, if properly defended and secured, in every respect adapted to the answer∣ing those important purposes: they therefore hum∣bly besought his majesty, that he would give im∣mediate directions for erecting batteries, with pro∣per cover, on the sides of the said harbour, in the most convenient places for guarding the entrance, called Hubberstone-road; and also such other for∣tifications as might be necessary to secure the inte∣rior parts of the harbour; and that, until such bat∣teries and fortifications could be completed, some temporary defence might be provided for the im∣mediate protection of the ships and vessels lying in the said harbour: finally, they assured him the house would make good to his majesty all such expences as should be incurred for these purposes. The ad∣dress met with a gracious reception, and a promise that such directions should be given. The harbour was actually surveyed, the places were pitched upon for batteries, and the estimates prepared; but we do not find that any further progress hath been made in the execution of this truly national design, which, in all probability, will be neglected until it shall be revived by some future disaster.</P>
<P>We have now finished the detail of all the mate∣rial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Close of thesession▪</NOTE> transactions of this session, except what relates to the fate of admiral Byng, which now claims our attention. In the mean time we may observe, that on the fourth day of July the session was closed with his majesty's harangue; the most remarkable and pleasing paragraph of which turned upon his royal assurance, that the succour and preservation of his dominions in America had been his constant care,
<PB N="470" REF="4850"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and, next to the security of his kingdoms, should continue to be his great and principal object. He told them he had taken such measures as, he trusted, by the blessing of God, might effectually disappoint the designs of the enemy in those parts; that he had no further view but to vindicate the just rights of his crown and subjects from the most injurious encroachments; to preserve tranquility, as far as the circumstances of things might admit; to pre∣vent the true friends of Britain, and the liberties of Europe, from being oppressed and endangered by any unprovoked and unnatural conjunction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of admiral Byng.</NOTE> Of all the transactions that distinguished this year, the most extraordinary was the sentence exe∣cuted on admiral Byng, the son of that great officer who had acquired such honour by his naval exploits in the preceding reign, and was ennobled for his services by the title of lord viscount Torrington. His second son, John Byng, had, from his earliest youth, been trained to his father's profession; and was generally esteemed one of the best officers in the navy, when he embarked in that expedition to Minorca which covered his character with disgrace, and even exposed him to all the horrors of an igno∣minious death. On the twenty-eighth day of De∣cember his trial began before a court-martial, held on board of the ship St. George in the harbour of Portsmouth, to which place Mr. Byng had been conveyed from Greenwich by a party of horse∣guards, and insulted by the populace in every town and village through which he passed. The court having proceeded to examine the evidences for the crown and the prisoner, from day to day, in the course of a long sitting, agreed unanimously to thir∣ty seven resolutions, implying their opinion, that
<PB N="471" REF="4860"/>
admiral Byng, during the engagement between the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> British and French fleets on the twentieth day of May last, did not do his utmost endeavour to take, seize, and destroy the ships of the French king, which it was his duty to have engaged; and to as∣sist such of his majesty's ships as were engaged, which it was his duty to have assisted; and that he did not exert his utmost power for the relief of St. Philip's castle. They therefore unanimously agreed, that he fell under part of the twelfth article of an act of parliament, passed in the twenty-second year of the present reign, for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act of parliament the laws re∣lating to the government of his majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by sea; and as that article posi∣tively prescribed death, without any alternative left to the discretion of the court, under any variation of circumstances, they unanimously adjudged the said admiral John Byng to be shot to death, at such time and on board of such ships as the lords commis∣sioners of the admiralty should please to direct. But as it appeared, by the evidence of the officers that were near the admiral's person, that no back∣wardness was perceiveable in him during the action, nor any mark of fear or confusion either in his countenance or behaviour; but that he delivered his orders coolly and distinctly, without seeming deficient in personal courage, and from other cir∣cumstances, they believed his misconduct did not arise either from cowardice or disaffection, they una∣nimously and earnestly recommended him as a pro∣per object of mercy. The admiral himself behaved, through the whole trial, with the most chearful com∣posure, seemingly the effect of conscious innocence, upon which perhaps he too much relied. Even
<PB N="472" REF="4870"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> after he had heard the evidence examined against him, and finished his own defence, he laid his ac∣count in being honourably acquitted, and ordered his coach to be ready for conveying him directly from the tribunal to London. A gentleman, his friend, by whom he was attended, having receiv∣ed intimation of the sentence to be pronounced, thought it his duty to prepare him for the occasion, that he might summon all his fortitude to his assist∣ance; and accordingly made him acquainted with the information he had received. The admiral gave tokens of surprize and resentment; but be∣trayed no marks of fear or disorder, either then or in the court when the sentence was pronounced. On the contrary, while divers members of the court-martial manifested grief, anxiety, and trepidation, shedding tears, and sighing with extraordinary emo∣tion, he heard his doom denounced without under∣going the least alteration of feature, and made a low obeisance to the president and the other mem∣bers of the court as he retired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is recom∣mended to mercy.</NOTE> The officers that composed this tribunal were so sensible of the law's severity, that they unanimously subscribed a letter to the board of admiralty, con∣taining this remarkable paragraph: "We cannot help laying the distresses of our minds before your lordships on this occasion, in finding ourselves un∣der a necessity of condemning a man to death, from the great severity of the twelfth article of war, part of which he falls under, which admits of no miti∣gation, if the crime should be committed by an er∣ror in judgment; and therefore, for our own con∣sciences sake, as well as in justice to the prisoner, we pray your lordships, in the most earnest manner, to recommend him to his majesty's clemency." The
<PB N="473" REF="4880"/>
lords of the admiralty, instead of complying with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the request of the court martial, transmitted their letter to the king, with copies of their proceedings, and a letter from themselves to his majesty, specify∣ing a doubt with regard to the legality of the sen∣tence, as the crime of Negligence, for which the admiral had been condemned, was not expressed in any part of the proceedings. At the same time co∣pies of two petitions from George lord viscount Torrington, in behalf of his kinsman admiral Byng, were submitted to his majesty's royal wisdom and determination. All the friends and relations of the unhappy convict employed and exerted their in∣fluence and interest for his pardon; and as the cir∣cumstances had appeared so strong in his favour, it was supposed that the sceptre of royal mercy would be extended for his preservation: but infamous arts were used to whet the savage appetite of the popu∣lace for blood. The cry of vengeance was loud throughout the land: sullen clouds of suspicion and malevolence interposing, were said to obstruct the genial beams of the best virtue that adorns the throne; and the s—n was given to understand, that the execution of admiral Byng was a victim absolutely necessary to appease the fury of the peo∣ple. His majesty, in consequence of the representati∣on made by the lords of the admiralty, referred the sentence to the consideration of the twelve judges, who were unanimously of opinion that the sentence was legal. This report being transmitted from the privy-council to the admiralty, their lordships issued a warrant for executing the sentence of death on the twenty-eighth day of February. One gentle∣man at the board, however, refused to subscribe the warrant, assigning, for his refusal, the reasons which
<PB N="474" REF="4890"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> we have inserted by way of note, for the satisfac∣tion of the reader <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A—I F—s's reasons for not signing the warrant for admiral Byng's execution.</P>
<P>"It may be thought great presumption in me to differ from so great authority as that of the twelve judges; but when a man is called upon to sign his name to an act, which is to give authority to the shedding of blood, he ought to be guided by his own conscience, and not by the opinions of other men.</P>
<P>In the case before us, it is not the merit of admiral Byng that I consi∣der: whether he deserves death, or not, is not a question for me to de∣cide; but whether or not his life can be taken away by the sentence pro∣nounced on him by the court-martial; and after ha ing so clearly ex∣plained their motives for pronouncing such a sentence, is the point which alone has employed my most serious consideration.</P>
<P>The twelfth article of war, on which admiral Byng's sentence is grounded, says, (according to my understanding of its meaning) "That every person who, in time of action, shall withdraw, keep back, or not come into fight, or who shall not do his utmost, &amp;c. through motives of cowardice, negligence, or disaffection, shall suffer death." The court∣martial does, in express words, acquit admiral Byng of cowardice and dis∣affection, and does not name the word Negligence. Admiral Byng does not, as I conceive, fall under the letter or description of the twelfth article of war. It may be said, that negligence is implied, though the word is not mentioned; otherwise the court-martial would not have brought his offence under the twelfth article, having acquitted him of cowardice and disaffection. But it must be acknowledged, that the negligence implied cannot be wilful negligence: for wilful negligence, in admiral Byng's situation, must have proceeded from either cowardice or disaffection, and he is expresly acquitted of both these crimes: besides, these crimes, which are implied only, and not named, may indeed justify suspicion, and pri∣vate opinion; but cannot satisfy the conscience in a case of blood.</P>
<P>Admiral Byng's fate was referred to a court martial; his life and death were left to their opinions. The court-martial condemn him to death, because, as they expresly say, they were under a necessity of do∣ing so by reason of the letter of the law, the severity of which they com∣plained of, because it admits of no mitigation. The court-martial ex∣presly say, that for the sake of their consciences, as well as in justice to the prisoner, they most earnestly recommend him to his majesty for mercy; it is evident then, that in the opinions and consciences of the judges, he was not deserving of death.</P>
<P>The question then is, shall the opinions, or necessities, of the court-martial determine admiral Byng's fate? if it should be the latter, he will be executed contrary to the intentions and meaning of his judges; if the former, his life is not forfeited. His judges declare him not de∣serving of death; but, mistaking either the meaning of the law, or the nature of his offence, they bring him under an article of war, which, ac∣cording to their own description of his offence, he does not, I conceive, fall under; and then they condemn him to death, because, as they say, the law admits of no mitigation. Can a man's life be taken away by such a sentence? I would not willingly be misunderstood, and have it believed that I judge of admiral Byng's deserts: that was the business of a court-martial, and it is my duty only to act according to my conscience; which, after deliberate consideration, assisted by the best light a poor understancing can afford, it remains still in doubt, and therefore I cannot consent to sign a warrant whereby the sentence of the court-mar∣tial may be carried into execution; for I cannot help thinking, that how∣ever criminal admiral Byng may be, his life is not forfeited by that sen∣tence. I don't mean to find fault with other men's opinions: all I en∣deavour at, is to give reasons for my own; and all I desire, or wish, is, that I may not be misunderstood; I do not pretend to judge admiral Byng's deserts, nor to give any opinion on the propriety of the act.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757▪</NOTE> Though mercy was denied to the criminal, the crown seemed determined to do nothing that should<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king's message to parlia∣ment with respect to the sen∣tence.</NOTE> be thought inconsistent with law. A member of parliament, who had sat upon the court-martial at Portsmouth, rose up in his place, and made ap∣plication to the house of commons, in behalf of himself, and several other members of that tribu∣nal, praying the aid of the legislature to be released from the oath of secrecy imposed on courts-martial, that they might disclose the grounds on which sen∣tence of death had passed on admiral Byng, and, perhaps, discover such circumstances as might shew the sentence to be improper. Although this appli∣cation produced no resolution in the house, the king, on the twenty-sixth day of February, sent a message to the commons by Mr. secretary Pitt, im∣porting, that though he had determined to let the law take its course, with relation to admiral Byng, and resisted all sollicitations to the contrary, yet, as a member of the house had expressed some scruples about the sentence, his majesty had thought fit to respite the execution of it, that there might be an opportunity of knowing, by the separate exami∣nation of the members of the court-martial, upon oath, what grounds there were for such scruples; and that his majesty was resolved still to let the sen∣tence be carried into execution, unless it should

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> appear from the said examination, that admiral Byng was unjustly condemned. The sentence might be strictly legal, and, at the same time, very severe, according to the maxim, summum jus sum∣ma injuria. In such cases, and perhaps in such cases only, the rigour of the law ought to be soft∣ened by the lenient hand of the royal prerogative. That this was the case of admiral Byng▪ appears from the warm and eager intercession of his jury; a species of intercession which hath generally, if not always, prevailed at the foot of the throne, when any thing favourable for the criminal had appeared in the course of the trial. How much more then might it have been expected to succeed, when earn∣estly urged as a case of conscience, in behalf of a man whom his judges had expresly acquitted of cowardice and treachery, the only two imputations that rendered him criminal in the eyes of the na∣tion! Such an interposition of the crown in parlia∣mentary transactions was irregular, unnecessary, and, at another juncture, might have been pro∣ductive of violent heats and declamation. At pre∣sent, however, it passed without censure, as the effect of inattention, rather than a design to en∣croach upon the privileges of the house.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill to re∣lease the members from their oath of se∣crecy.</NOTE> The message being communicated, a bill was immediately brought in to release the members of the court-marshal from the obligation of secrecy, and passed through the lower house without oppo∣sition: but in the house of lords it appeared to be destitute of a proper foundation. They sent a mes∣sage to the commons, desiring them to give leave that such of the members of the court-martial, as were members of that house, might attend their lordships, in order to be examined, on the second

reading of the bill: accordingly, they and the rest<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> of the court-martial attended, and answered all questions without hesitation. As they did not in∣sist upon any excuse, nor produce any satisfactory reason for shewing that the man they had con∣demned was a proper object of mercy, their lord∣ships were of opinion that there was no occasion for passing any such bill, which, therefore they almost unanimously rejected. It is not easy to conceive what stronger reasons could be given for proving Mr. Byng an object of mercy than those mentioned in the letter sent to the board of admiralty, by the members of the court-martial, who were im∣powered to try the imputed offence, consequently must have been deemed well qualified to judge of his conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The exe∣cution of admiral Byng.</NOTE> The unfortunate admiral being thus abandoned to the stroke of justice, prepared himself for death with resignation and tranquility. He maintained a surprising chearfulness to the last; nor did he, from his condemnation to his execution, exhibit the least sign of impatience or apprehension. Dur∣ing that interval he had remained on board of the Monarque, a third rate ship of war, anchored in the harbour of Portsmouth, under a strong guard, in custody of the marshal of the admiralty. On the fourteenth of March, the day fixed for his exe∣cution, the boats belonging to the squadron at Spithead being manned and armed, containing their captains and officers, with a detachment of marines, attended this solemnity in the harbour, which was also crouded with an infinite number of other boats and vessels filled with spectators. About noon, the admiral having taken leave of a clergy∣man, and two friends who accompanied him,
<PB N="478" REF="4940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> walked out of the great cabin to the quarter▪deck, where two files of marines were ready to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cute the sentence. He advanced with a firm, delibe∣rate step, a composed and resolute countenance, and resolved to suffer with his face uncovered, un∣til his friends representing that his looks would possibly intimidate the soldiers, and prevent their taking aim properly, he submitted to their request, threw his hat on the deck, kneeled on a cushion, tied one white handkerchief over his eyes, and dropped the other as a signal for his executioners, who fired a volley so decisive that five balls passed through his body, and he dropped down dead in an instant. The time in which this tragedy was acted, from his walking out of the cabin to his being de∣posited in the coffin, did not exceed three minutes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Paper de∣livered by him to the marshal of the admi∣ralty.</NOTE> Thus fell, to the astonishment of all Europe, ad∣miral John Byng, who, whatever his errors and indiscretions might have been, seems to have been rashly condemned, meanly given up, and cruelly sacrificed to vile considerations. The sentiments of his own fate he avowed on the verge of eternity, when there was no longer any cause of dissimulation, in the following declaration, which, immediately before his death, he delivered to the marshal of the admiralty. "A few moments will now deliver me from the virulent persecution, and frustrate the further malice of my enemies. Nor need I envy them a life subject to the sensations my injuries, and the injustice done me, must create; persuaded I am that justice will be done to my re∣putation hereafter: the manner and cause of raising and keeping up the popular clamour and preju∣dice against me, will be seen through. I shall be considered (as I now perceive myself) a victim des∣tined
<PB N="479" REF="4950"/>
to divert the indignation and resentment of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> an injured and deluded people from the proper ob∣jects. My enemies themselves must now think me innocent. Happy for me, at this my last mo∣ment, that I know my own innocence, and am conscious that no part of my country's misfortunes can be owing to me. I heartily wish the shedding my blood may contribute to the happiness and ser∣vice of my country; but cannot resign my just claim to a faithful discharge of my duty according to the best of my judgment, and the utmost exer∣tion of my ability for his majesty's honour, and my country's service. I am sorry that my endeavours were not attended with more success; and that the armament, under my command, proved too weak to succeed in an expedition of such moment. Truth has prevailed over calumny and falshood, and justice has wiped off the ignominious stain of my supposed want of personal courage, and the charge of disaffection. My heart acquits me of these crimes: but who can be presumptuously sure of his own judgment? If my crime is an error in judg∣ment, or differing in opinion from my judges, and if yet the error in judgment should be on their side, God forgive them, as I do; and may the distress of their minds, and uneasiness of their consciences, which in justice to me they have represented, be relieved and subside as my resentment has done. The Supreme Judge sees all hearts and motives, and to him I must subm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the justice of my cause."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks upon the admiral's fate.</NOTE> Notwithstanding all that has been said in his favour; notwithstan sing the infamous arts that were practised to keep up the cry against him: not∣withstanding this solemn appeal to heaven in his last moments, and even self-conviction of inno∣cence,
<PB N="480" REF="4960"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the character of admiral Byng, in point of personal courage, will still with many people re∣main problematical. They will still be of opinion, that if the spirit of a British admiral had been pro∣perly exerted, the French fleet would have been defeated, and Minorca relieved. A man's opinion of danger varies at different times, in consequence of an irregular tide of animal spirits, and he is actuated by considerations which he dares not avow.</P>
<P>After an officer, thus influenced, has hesitated or kept aloof in the hour of trial, the mind, eager for its own justification, assembles, with surprizing in∣dustry, every favourable circumstance of excuse, and broods over them with parental partiality, until it becomes not only satisfied, but even enamoured of their beauty and complexion; like a doating mo∣ther, blind to the deformity of her own offspring. Whatever Mr. Byng's internal feelings might have been; whatever consequences might have attended his behaviour on that occasion; as the tribunal be∣fore which he was tried, acquitted him expresly of cowardice and treachery, he was, without all doubt, a proper object for royal clemency, and so impartial posterity will judge him, after all those dishonour∣able motives of faction and of fear, by which his fate was influenced, shall be lost in oblivion, or re∣membered with disdain. The people of Great Bri∣tain, naturally fierce, impatient, and clamorous, have been too much indulged, upon every petty miscarriage, with trials, courts-martial, and dismis∣sions, which tend only to render their military com∣manders rash and precipitate, the populace more licentious and intractable, and to disgrace the na∣tional character in the opinion of mankind.</P>
