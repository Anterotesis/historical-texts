<HEAD>Mr. POPE to her Grace the Dutchess of HAMILTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER>London, October—Betweeen
day and night—The writer drunk,
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MRS. Whitworth (who, as her Epi∣taph
on Twitnam Highway assures us, had attained to as
much perfection and purity as any since the Apostles)
is now deposited according to her own order between
a fig-tree and a vine, there to be found at the last
Resurrection.</P>
<P>I am just come from seeing your Grace in much
the like situation, between a hony-suckle and a rose-bush;
where you are to continue as long as canvas
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
can last: I suppose the painter by those emblems
intended to intimate, on the one hand your Grace's
sweet disposition to your friends; and, on the other,
to shew you are near enough related to the thistle of
Scotland to deserve the same motto
with regard to your enemies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord William will conster this Latine if you send it to Thistleworth.</NOTE> <HI>Nemo
me impunè lacessit.</HI></P>
<P>The two foregoing periods, me∣thinks,
are so mystical, learned, and perplext, that if
you have any statesmen or divines about you, they
can't chuse but be pleased with them. One divine
you cannot be without, as a good christian; and a
statesman you have lately had, for I hear my Lord
Selkirk has been with you. But (that I may not be
unintelligible quite to the bottom of this page) I must
tell your Grace in English, that I have made a
painter bestow the aforesaid ornaments round about
you (for upon you there needs none), and I am, upon
the whole, pleased with my picture beyond expression.
I may now say of your picture, it is the thing in the
world the likest you, except yourself; as a cautious
person once said of an elephant, it was the biggest
in the world, except itself.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
You see, Madam, it is not impossible for you to
be compared to an elephant: and you must give me
leave to show you one may carry on the simile.</P>
<P>An elephant never bends his knees; and I am
told your Grace says no prayers. An elephant has
a most remarkable command of his snout, and so has
your Grace when you imitate my Lady O—y.
An elephant is a great lover of men, and so is your
Grace for all I know, tho' from your partiality to
myself, I should rather think you lov'd little children.</P>
<P>I beg you not to be discouraged in this point.
Remember the text which I'll preach upon, the first
day I am a parson. <HI>Suffer little children to come to me—</HI>
And—<HI>Despise not one of these little ones.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam—despise great bears, such as Gay;
who now goes by the dredful name of, <HI>The Beast of
Blois,</HI> where Mr. Pulteney and he are settled, and
where he shows tricks gratis, to all the beasts of
his own country (for strangers do not yet understand
the voice of the beast). I have heard from him but
once, Lord Warwick twice, Mrs. Lepell thrice: if
there be any that has heard from him four times, I
suppose it is you.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
I beg Mr. Blondel may know, Dr. Logg has re∣ceived
Ordination, and enters upon his function this
winter at Mrs. Blount's. They have chosen this
innocent man for their confessor; and I believe most
Roman Catholick ladies, that have any sins, will
follow their example. This good priest will be of
the order of Melchisedeck, a priest for ever, and
serve a family from generation to generation. He'll
stand in a corner as quietly as a clock, and being
wound up once a week, strike up a loud alarum to
sin on a Sunday morning. Nay, if the Christian
Religion should be abolish'd (as indeed there is great
reason to expect it from the wisdom of the legislature),
he might at worst make an excellent bonefire, which
is all that (upon a change of religion) can be desired
from a heretique. I do not hope your Grace should
be converted, but however I wish you would call at
Mrs. B.'s out of curiosity. To meet people one
likes, is thought by some the best reason for going
to church, and I dare promise you'll like one ano∣ther.
They are extreamly your servants, or else I
should not think them my friends.</P>
<P>I ought to keep up the custom, and ask you to
send me something. Therefore pray, Madam, send
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
me yourself, that is, a letter; and pray make haste
to bring up yourself, that is all I value, to towne.
I am, with the truest respect, the least ceremony,
and the most zeal,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
Your Grace's most obedient,
Faithfull, and most humble servant,
<SIGNED>A. POPE.</SIGNED>
Mr. Hamilton, I am your's.
There is a short letter for you.</CLOSER>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Mr. POPE to her Grace the Dutchess of
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke married to his third wife Catherine, na∣tural daughter of king James II. (by Catherine Sidley, daughter of Sir Charles Sidley, whom he created Coun∣tess of Dorchester, and who, upon his abdicating the throne, married the earl of Portmore): He dignified her with the name of the lady Catherine Darnley, gave her the place of a Duke's daughter, and permitted her to bear his arms. She was, very young, left a widow by James Earl of Anglesey, from whom she was divorced by the King and both Houses of Parliament, for the Earl's ill usage of her.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Twit'nam, <DATE>Jan. 27, 1720.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think myself obliged by your Grace's
many condescensions of goodness to me, in particular
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
your informing me by a line of Dr. Ch—'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chamberlen's.</NOTE> state of
health. I am really impatient to hear further of him.</P>
<P>The morning I left the town, I went with Mr.
Jervas to Belluchi's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An Italian painter, who composed the Duke's monu∣ment, to which this alludes; whereon are represented the portraiture of his Grace, habited like a Roman general; and at his feet, that of her Grace weeping. On the top of the basis of the column, is seen, in relievo, Time bearing away the four deceased children of the Dutchess, whose effigies are represented in profile-bustos, supported by Cupids lamenting.</NOTE>, but parting in haste, I had
not his opinion at large; only he assures me, he
thinks the figures will not be too small, considering
that those which are nearest the eye, are, at least, as
large as the life. I can't but be of opinion, that my
Lord Duke's and your Grace's, ought to be made
portraits, and as like as possible; of which they
have yet no resemblance. There being no picture
(as I believe) of the Duke in profile, it might be
well, I fancy, if Belluchi copied the side-face from
that busto that stands in the salon.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
I beg your Grace's pardon for the freedom with
which I write to you: and I ought to ask it, (now
I think on't) on another occasion, in which I have
used too much freedom: having a great esteem for
the famous Bononcini, not only from his great fame,
but from a personal knowledge of his character; and
this being increased by the ill treatment he has met
with here, I ventured, among other persons of the
first distinction, who subscribed to me for his com∣posures,
newly ingraved, to set down the name of
your Grace. When I did this, your Grace was at
Bath, and I forgot ever since to tell you of it, 'till
now, when the book's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Cantatas.</NOTE> coming out, put me in mind
of it.</P>
<P>If you can excuse this fault, I sincerely think I
shall not err this way again, 'till such another great
man as Bononcini arises, (for whenever that happens,
I doubt not the English will use him as scurvily) but
that your Grace needs not apprehend, during our
lives. I am, with the sincerest respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
Your Grace's most obliged,
Most obedient servant,

<HEAD>LETTERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Why these Letters to Miss <HI>Blount</HI> have not a place in the Works of Mr. Pope, because borrowed from Voiture, when that to a Lady with a book of drawings, is taken from one he wrote to Madame Rambouillet, in the name of Collet the engraver, presenting a book of his prints, and others, containing compliments to several Ladies, are extracted from him, is, we imagine, owing to a de∣sign of rendering the plagiary less liable to detection.</NOTE>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the Death of her BROTHER<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voiture has a letter thus superscribed, “To Mademoiselle de Rambouillet,” on the death of her brother, who died of the plague, and whom she attended during his sickness; of which, this is only a trans∣lation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING no less admiration for your
courage and good nature, than sympathy with your
grief; I am so highly sensible of both the one and
the other, that if I were capable to render you those
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
commendations which were justly due to you, and
that comfort whereof you stand in need, I must con∣fess
I should be much troubled where to begin; for
what obligations can be more equally enforcing, than
to render to so eminent a virtue the honour it merits;
and to so violent affliction the comfort it requires?
But I am to blame to put a distance between these
two things, since charity has so perfectly united them,
that the fond assistance you afforded your late Brother,
should now prove an extraordinary comfort to you,
since God will bestow that on you out of justice,
which others obtain out of his indulgence; his in∣finite
goodness being such, as will not suffer, unre∣warded,
so exemplary an act of tenderness, as what,
thro' a contempt of your own life, engaged you in the
offices of the best and tenderest sister in the world,
beyond the limits of all obligations; and by an ad∣mirable
constancy, made you assur'd amidst a danger
that terrifies the most daring. Upon this account I
am confident that he will preserve you from it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The small-pox.</NOTE>, and
will shower on you, as a reward of your virtue, the
blessings which are wish'd you, by,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Here send you the elegy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter and elegy on coquets, I find sent by M. Voiture to Madam de Vigean; of which, this, like∣wise, is a translation.</NOTE>, which
you have but too often demanded of me, and which
heretofore hath indeed been heard by others, but till
now, hath not been read by any.</P>
<P>It is my wish, that the same fortune may in this
happen to me as hath befallen you; who, after you
have for so long time concealed the noblest things in
the world, have, in the discovery of it, dazzled all
those that have seen it. But it is an over-great fond∣ness
for my own verses, to wish them that advantage,
nor indeed should I wish them better, since they were
not made for you: if you think them very ill, you
are so much the more obliged to me for them, in that
knowing it as well as you, yet I have not forborn
sending them to you. And, to deal freely with you,
a less power than what you have within these few days
gained upon me, would not have been sufficient to
have prevailed with me to do it: and, without
your command, madam, they had never known any
other place than that of my own memory. But it is
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
high time it were delivered of them, to make room
for something more delightful; I mean that which
Mrs.—had the grace to acquaint me with the
other day, and which fills it with so much at present,
that I doubt whether there be place for any thing
else.</P>
<P>I perceive, madam, that where it was my design to
send you a letter of excuse and compliment, I am
fallen into one of love; but I wish all the other
defects you shall find in it, were as pardonable as
that. In the mean time let me assure you, that I
have not of a long time been so engaged, and that
there are many in the world to whom I would not
say so much, even tho' they held a dagger at my
throat.</P>
<P>But, since there is no fear of any scandal, you are
obliged, madam, at least in my opinion, to look
favourably on those elements of affection, were it but
to see how I should behave myself, if I should fall in
love; and, if I were permitted, what might be the
consequence of it. I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter I find also directed by M. Voiture to the Marchioness of Rambouillet, of which this is a translation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' my liberality were, as you say,
greater than Alexander's, it were more than recom∣penced
by the thanks you have been pleased to return
it. Even his ambition, as insatiable as it was, would,
by so extraordinary a favour, have been limited. He
would have valued this honour more highly than the
Persian diadem, and he would not have envied Achil∣les
the praises of Homer, might he have yours. In
like manner, madam, considering the reputation you
do me, if I envy his, it is not so much that which he
hath acquired, as what you have bestowed on him;
and he hath received no honours which I do not look
upon below my own, unless it be that you do him,
when you call him your gallant. Neither his own
vanity nor his flatterers have ever advanced any thing
so advantageous to him, and the quality of the son of
Jupiter Ammon was not so glorious as that. But, if
nothing can cure me of the jealousy I have of it, yet
madam, knowing you as I do, I am confident, if you
do him that favour, it is not so much because he is
the greatest of mankind, as because it is two thousand
years since he was.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="19"/>
However it be, we may see in this the greatness of
his fortune, which not able to forsake him so many
years after his death, adds to his conquests a person
which celebrates them more than the wife and daugh∣ter
of Darius, and hath reinfused into him a soul
greater than that of the world he hath subdued.</P>
<P>I should fear, by your example, to write in too high
a stile, but can a man aim at one too high, speaking
of you, and Alexander? I beseech you, madam, to
assure yourself I have for you the same passion which
you have for him, and that the admiration of your
virtues shall ever engage me to be,</P>

Yours, &amp;c.</CLOSER>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter is likewise directed by M. Voiture to Mademoiselle Rambouillet, of which this is, for the most part, a translation.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could never believe it possible that the
receipt of a letter from you should add to my afflic∣tion,
or that you could have possibly sent me such bad
news, as that you could not comfort me at the same
time.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20"/>
I thought my unhappiness at such a point as could
not admit of any addition, and that since you were
able something to strengthen my patience to endure
the absence of your mother and you, there could not
be any misfortune which you could not have encou∣raged
me to suffer. But give me leave to tell you,
that I have found the contrary in the affliction I have
for the death of Mrs. A—, which hath been heavy
enough to crush me, and wanted not much to spend
the remainder of my patience.</P>
<P>You may easily judge, madam, what an excessive
grief it must needs be to me to have lost a friend so
good, so sprightly and so accomplished as she, and
one that having always given me so many expressions
of her affection, would needs do something when she
had not many hours to continue here. But tho' I re∣flected
not on my own concernments, yet could I not
but infinitely regret a person by whom you were infi∣nitely
beloved; and who, among many particular
endowments, had that of knowing you as much as
may be, and esteeming you above all things. Yet I
must confess, if this disturbance can admit of any
remission, it is to reflect on the constancy she expres∣sed,
and the fortitude wherewith she hath suffered a
thing whereof the name would make her tremble at
any time.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21"/>
I am extremely comforted to understand, that at her
death, she had those qualities which only she wanted
in her life, and that she so opportunely found courage
and resolution. When I consider it seriously, it is
somewhat against my conscience to bemoan her; and
methinks it speaks an over-interested affection, to be
sad because she hath left us to better her condition,
and is gone into the other world, (“from whose
bourne no traveller returns”) to find that quiet she
could never meet with in this.</P>
<P>I very heartily entertain the exhortations you give
me thereupon, which is often to con over a lesson so
profitable and necessary, and to prepare myself for the
like one day. I know how to make my advantage of
your remonstrance. The miseries we have run thro'
all this while is no small preparation for it: there's
no better lecture to instruct a man how to die well,

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a LADY in the Name of her BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not a chaste ear and a
pure heart, do not peruse this letter; for, as Jeremy
Taylor says in his Holy Living and Dying, the first
thing a virgin ought to endeavour, is to be ignorant
of the distinction of sexes.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23"/>
It is in the confidence I have that you are thus
innocent, that I endeavour to gratify your curiosity
in a point, in which I am sensible none but a brother
could do it with decency.</P>
<P>I shall entertain you with the most reigning curi∣osity
in the town; I mean a person who is equally
the toast of gentlemen and ladies, and is at present
more universally admired than any of either sex. You
know how few proficients have a greater genius for
monsters, than myself; but I never tasted a monster
to that degree I have done this creature. It was not,
like other monsters, produced in the desarts of Arabia,
nor came from the country of the Great Mogul; but
is the production of the joint endeavours of a Kentish
parson and his spouse, who intended in the singleness
of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex, and
Providence has sent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning this crea∣ture
about town. Mr. Cromwell observes that the
age is very licentious, and the present reign very lewd
and corrupt, in permitting a Lady <HI>By Authority</HI> (as
appears by the printed bills) to expose her personal
curiosities for a shilling.</P>
<P>Mr. P—looks upon it as a prodigy portending
some great revolution in the state; to strengthen
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
which opinion, he produces the following prophecy
of Nostradamus, which he explains politically:
<Q><L>“When as two sexes join'd in one,</L>
<L>Shall in the realm of Brute be shown;</L>
<L>Then factions shall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choose a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This prodigy of common gender</L>
<L>Is neither sex, but a Pretender;</L>
<L>So the Lord shield the Faith's Defender.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. N—admires what people wonder at so much;
and says she is just so herself. The Duchess of S—is
of the same opinion.</P>
<P>Among these various conjectures, that I might be
informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phy∣sician
and a Divine; the one to inspect the state of its
body, the other to examine that of its mind. The
persons I made choice of were the ingenious Dr. P—,
and the reverend Mr.—. We were no sooner in the
room, but the party came to us drest in that habit, in
which the ladies affect an hermaphroditical imitation
of men—your sharp wit, my dear sister, will im∣mediately
conclude that I mean a riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the
doctor, the divine, or myself look'd first. The priest,
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
you will maliciously fancy, was in his nature most an
infidel, and doubted most of this miracle; we there∣fore
propos'd to him to take the surest method of be∣lieving,
seeing and feeling. He comply'd with both
admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of snuff
upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we should by no
means regard it as female, but as a male, for by so
doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness.</P>
<P>The doctor upon inspection differ'd from this opi∣nion;
he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at
most a natural one. He said upon the whole it was
a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think
otherwise, was a trifle; nothing being more common
than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which
the mother long'd for.</P>
<P>As for this party's temper of mind, it appears to
be a most even disposition, partaking of the good
qualities of both sexes; for she is neither so inacces∣sible
as other ladies, nor is he so impudent as other
gentlemen. Of how obliging and complaisant a turn
appears by this; that he tells the ladies he has the
inclinations of a gentleman, and that she tells the
gentlemen she has the <HI>tendre</HI> of a lady. As a farther
proof of this affable disposition, he formerly receiv'd
visits of the fair sex in their masques; till an imper∣tinent
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
fellow in a female disguise, mingled with a
party of ladies, and impudently overheard their
improving speculations.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, she civilly promised at my
request, that my two sisters should be admitted pri∣vately,
whenever you would do her the honour of
your consideration.</P>
<P>How agreeable soever this sight has been to me, I
assure you it cannot be so pleasing as the sight of you
in town; and whatever you may see in the country, I
dare affirm no man or woman can shew you the like.</P>
<P>I therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to
this place; for tho' indeed, like most other brothers,
I should be sorry you were married at my expence;
yet I would by no means, like them, detain you in
the country from your admirers: for you may believe
me, no brother in the world ever loved a sister as I
do you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sarcastical letter, and the verses describing Blen∣heim, inserted among the poetry, were perhaps rejected in compliment to the present proprietors of that heavy piece of architecture.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not describe Bl—in particular,
not to forestal your expectations before you see it:
only take a short account, which, I will hazard my
little credit, is no unjust one. I never saw so great
a thing with so much littleness in it: I think the
architect built it entirely in complaisance to the taste
of its owners; for it is the most inhospitable thing
imaginable, and the most selfish: it has, like their
own hearts, no room for strangers, and no reception
for any person of superior quality to themselves.
There are but just two apartments, for the master
and mistress, below; and but two apartments above,
(very much inferior to them) in the whole house.
When you look upon the outside, you'd think it
large enough for a prince; when you see the inside,
it is too little for a subject; and has not conveniency
to lodge a common family. It is a house of entries
and passages; among which there are three vista's
thro' the whole, very uselessly handsome. There is
what might have been a fine gallery, but spoil'd by
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
two arches towards the end of it, which take away
the sight of several of the windows. There are two
ordinary stair-cases instead of one great one. The
best things within the house are the hall, which is
indeed noble and well proportioned; and the cellars
and offices under-ground, which are the most com∣modious,
and the best contrived of the whole. At
the top of the building are several cupola's and little
turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the
building look at once finical and heavy. What
seems of the best taste, is that front towards the
gardens, which is not yet loaded with these turrets.
The two sides of the building are entirely spoiled by
two monstrous bow-windows, which stand just in the
middle, instead of doors: and, as if it were fatal,
that some trifling littleness should every where destroy
the grandeur, there are in the chief front two semi∣circles
of a lower structure than the rest, that cut off
the angles, and look as if they were purposely de∣signed
to hide a loftier and nobler piece of building,
the top of which appears above them. In a word,
the whole is a most expensive absurdity; and the
Duke of Shrewsbury gave a true character of it,
when he said, it was a great quarry of stones above
ground.</P>

We paid a visit to the spring, where Rosamond
bathed herself; on a hill where remains only a piece
of a wall of the old palace of Henry II. We toasted
her shade in the cold water, not without a thought

I was not a little disappointed to find your Lordship
in London, though, considering the fine weather,
and how late in the season you enjoyed it, I ought
not to lament an absence which must both give you
health and pleasure. Your house I found totally at
my service, and took up my choice (like a young

Margaret's. How much might I say upon that sub∣ject,
were I a poet! but the misfortune of being
what seldom consists with that character, a bashful
and backward man, keeps me silent. I shall be little
in town (if at all) till your return, and, in truth,
since I came home, I have had my health so ill, that
I must in a manner live by myself; and think I must
either lead such a life as I did at Southampton, which
is inconsistent with a town life, or lock myself up

If you have, I will stay for you, and let Mr.

must be made with some haste, because they go next
week, and I shall want time to prepare. I thought
Mrs. Cecil had receipts before. The names of Lady
Ranelagh and Lady Cavendish, were inserted long
since in the list.</P>
<P>You may tell Mr. Rollinson that Gay was not
sure he should go to Lord Bolingbroke's when he
came hither; or help him to some excuse, for his
neglect was scandalous, and has given him much
vexation of spirit.</P>
<P>I should have been glad to have had the Report of

If the Whigs now say, that B. is the hero of my
Preface, the Tories said (you may remember) three
years ago, that Cato was the hero of my poetry. It
looks generous enough to be always on the side of
the distressed; and my patrons of the other party

may expect great panegyricks from me when they
come to be impeached by the future party rage of

much <HI>vanity</HI> in my praising Bol—, as in his prai∣sing
Hal—. No people in the world are so apt to
give themselves airs as authors.</P>

your commerce, a combination of protected thieves,
the bane of industry and trade? Nor is there any

there is too much truth in your remarks; the remem∣brance
of virtue is almost lost, and if any retain

have appeared in your parts: and one proof of their
excellency, is their being naturalized by persons of
very eminent ability and rank. Other languages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have been translated both into French and Italian.</NOTE>
are inrich'd with these and others of his works; yet,
would you believe it, he has translated Homer, pre∣serv'd
the sublimity, strength, harmony, closeness,
and every other excellence of that venerable poet,
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
without knowing a syllable of Greek<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pope's Letter to Addison, Jan. 30, 1713-14.</NOTE>; and with
an absolute ignorance of the English. His Essay
on Criticism, is a smooth repetition of Vida's non∣sense.
His Pastorals are no Pastorals. Nor is he a
poet. These things are brayed about our streets.
The <HI>Asinorum crepitus,</HI> the din of Grub-street pre∣tenders
to poetry, and false critics, have arose to
poison our judgments; some say, he is too little to
write well; others, that he has only a knack of
writing, and these wretches all write themselves, to
convince us it is without a knack; cellars are full of
their murmurings, where, like so many merciless
chymists, they violently rack and torture nature to
confess some worth she has not in her. Mr. Pope is
accounted by those, not his enemies, of overmuch
borrowing; this you will rather praise than disap∣prove,
when you shall know, that the finest thoughts
of the best writers were never made use of by him,
till he had improved and made them better. View
him in his public character, he is an honour to our
nation; the good and wise rejoice that such and so
notable a genius is manifested amongst us; he has the
satisfaction of not having lived in vain, and has
obliged the valuable part of mankind, and is beloved
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
by all the learned, good, and wise. View him in
private life, there is nothing more amiable and endear∣ing.
He is an example of the duty we owe our
parents, and the love we ought to bear our friends.
There is no truth, if what I tell you is not true; no
friendship, if I am not your friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That these Letters were written by Mr. Pope to Mr. Gay appears by the compliment paid him in this third Letter; for the works of his friend, and the catastrophe of his play, evidently allude to the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> So the character in the conclusion of the second cor∣responds with that which Mr. Jacob (in his Letter to Mr. Dennis, April 24, 1729, published by Mr. Dennis in his Remarks on the <HI>Dunciad</HI>) mentions:—In the Lives of the Poets, by Mr. Jacob, Vol. II. p. 145, 146, 151, &amp;c. the sentences following are by his authority: “This excellent poet, [Alexander Pope] whose fame exceeds not his merit, was born, &amp;c. There is great ease, strength, wit, and judgment, in his compositions; all his pieces are universally applauded, and the great Sheffield asserted his work. His private character is the best, being summ'd up in a good companion and a firm friend. Mr. Pope has fire and spirit equal to that great undertaking, his translation of Homer: and he is excellent in prose as well as verse,” &amp;c. That these high praises and commendations of himself were by him particularly approved of, in a printed proof of his life and character, which I transmitted to him for his correction, I am ready to make oath of, if requir'd; and by his alterations and additions therein, he entirely made the compliment his own.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FORGIVE me, if I obtrude my ad∣vice;
think not of publishing, as yet. Your works,
like fine painting and wine, will ripen into more
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
worth by age; you should certainly complete the
catastrophe. I rejoice you have resisted the tempta∣tion
offer'd; it would be madness to throw an ap∣pearance
of partiality on the face of your perform∣ance,
which you have so bravely avoided in every
other part. The devil is black enough in his real
character; the truer you can paint him, the more
damnably he will appear. I can but laugh to see
what an appearance kings, and ministers (the guar∣dians
of kings) make, when they are shewn in
history, stripp'd of courtiers and attendants. If in
their lives they had few sure friends, after their deaths
they shall have fewer. It is then that the glory is
taken from their heads, and their pride trampled on.
Are they not deceived, my friend, who think by
power to bury in oblivion the ill actions they are
guilty of; or to keep posterity from the knowledge
of their vices? I was the other day at a great man's
levee; it made me shudder: he was corpulent and
gross of body, and seem'd to me as if fattening for
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
some sacrifice. I then thought a corrupt minister,
surrounded by his creatures and mercenaries, like the
man, who by unlawful practices had obtained the
services of evil spirits, and thinks it noble to be at∣tended
on by fiends, but yet expects in the end,
that they will tear him to pieces.</P>

no very violent inclination to lose my heart, especi∣ally
in so wild and savage a place as this forest is: in

<L>And two substantial meals a-day were made.</L>
<L>The business of it is t' express,</L>
<L>From me and from my holiness,</L>
<L>To you, and to your gentleness,</L>
<L>How much I wish you health and happiness;</L>
<L>And much good news, and little spleen as may be;</L>
<L>A hearty stomach, and sound lady;</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="59"/>
And ev'ry day a double dose of coffee,</L>
<L>To make you look as sage as any Sophy.</L>
<P>For the rest, I must be content in plain prose to
assure you, that I am very much oblig'd to you for
the favour of your letter, and in particular, for the
translation of that one Latin verse, which cost you
three in English,
<Q><L>“One short, one long,</L>
<L>One smooth, one strong,</L>
<L>One right, one wrong.”</L></Q></P>
<P>But if I may be allowed to object against any thing
you write (which I must do, if it were only to be
even with you for your severity to me) it shou'd be
that passage in yours, where you are pleas'd to call
the whores of Drury-lane, the nymphs of Drury.
I must own it was some time before I could frame to
myself any plausible excuse for this expression; but
affection (which you know, Sir, excuses all things)
at last furnish'd me with one in your justification;
which I have here sent you, in verse, that you may
have at least some rhyme to defend you, tho' you
shou'd have no reason.</P>
<Q><L>If wit or critick blame the tender swain,</L>
<L>Who stil'd the gentle damsels in his strain</L>

Be this his answer, and most just excuse—</L>
<L>“Far be it, Sirs, from my more civil muse,</L>
<L>Those loving ladies rudely to traduce.</L>
<L>Alleys and lanes are terms too vile and base,</L>
<L>And give ideas of a narrow pass;</L>
<L>But the well-worn paths of the nymphs of Drury</L>
<L>Are large and wide, Tydcombe and I assure ye.”</L></Q>
<P>I made no question but the news of Sapho's stay∣ing
behind me in the town, wou'd surprize you. But
she is since come into the country, and to surprize
you more, I will inform you, that the first person
she nam'd when I waited on her, was one Mr. Crom∣well.
What an ascendant have you over all the sex,
who could gain the fair-one's heart by appearing
before her in a long, black, unpowder'd periwig;
nay, without so much as the very extremities of clean
linen in neckloth and cuffs! I guess that your friend
Vertumnus, among all the forms he assum'd to win
the good graces of Pomona, never took upon him
that of a slovenly beau. Well, Sir, I leave you to
your meditations on this occasion, and to languish
unactive (as you call it.)</P>

<P>ABOUT the time that Mr. Wycherley
came to London, I troubled you with a letter of
mine, in hopes of prevailing with you to continue
the favour of yours. But I now write to convince
you that silence is not always the surest guard against
impertinence: I have too great a sense of those many
civilities receiv'd from you, to desist from expressing
it, till I receive more: for you not only have ac∣quainted
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
me with many of my errors in scribling,
but with some in my conduct; and I owe to you the
knowledge of things infinitely more of concern to
myself, than any thing of mine can be to others.
The advantage I have obtain'd from both might
endanger your being put upon an endless trouble of
criticizing on the rest of my faults, and therefore
you have reason to make some delay with those now
under your examination. Tho' I never cou'd expect
you shou'd once look upon them, but when you were
perfectly at leisure; yet so much assurance your
former kindness had given me, that I was under
some apprehensions for your health, on the score of
your silence; and I desir'd Mr. Wycherley to inform
me on that subject; which he did not, either through
forgetfulness, or else believing I shou'd be soon in
town. And I had certainly been there before this
time, had it been in my power to comply with his
most obliging invitation, and my desires of seeing
him and you. But since I find I must not hope for
that satisfaction till after Christmas, I entreat you
will not, in the mean time, let me be so unhappy as
to doubt of your welfare; which is the sole business
of this letter, that (to make you some amends for
the unconscionable length of my last) shall not add a

<P>I Receiv'd the favour of your kind
letter, wherein I find you have oblig'd me before I
expected it, in reviewing the papers I sent you. I
have been ask'd, I believe twenty times, by Sir
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
William Trumbull for a sight of that translation,
but have deferr'd it till I cou'd supply the blank
spaces I left in the fair copy, by your approbation.
If therefore you will send it inclos'd to Mr. Thorold
the Tobacconist in Duke-street, to be sent me by the
coach as soon as you can conveniently, it will come
very opportunely; since I find I can no longer refuse
to show it to Sir William with any decency. I am
mightily pleas'd with your objection to my attributing
friendship to dogs, yet think the want of equality is
no obstacle to the friendship of some country gentle∣men
of my acquaintance with theirs. I am ex∣tremely
impatient to enjoy your agreeable conver∣sation,
and to let you know how much I prefer it to
any here, where indeed dogs and men are much on a
level, only the first have more good-nature and more
sagacity. If I were not at this instant very much
afflicted with the head ach, I would offer a few more
considerations in behalf of the four-legg'd part of
the creation. But I will only add one word, that
you and I will never disagree about dogs, or any
thing else, for I am with very much esteem, and ever
will be,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>November 24, 1710.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>TO make use of that freedom
and familiarity of style which we have taken up in
our correspondence, and which is more properly talk∣ing
upon paper, than writing; I will tell you with∣out
any preface, that I never took Tycho Brahe for
one of the antients, or in the least an acquaintanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Lucan's; nay 'tis a mercy on this occasion that I
do not give you an account of his life and conver∣sation,
which perhaps I know a little more of than
you imagine; as how he lived some years like an in∣chanted
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
knight in a certain island, with a tale into
the bargain of a king of Denmark's mistress that
shall be nameless.—But I have compassion on you,
and wou'd not for the world you shou'd stay any
longer among the <HI>Genii</HI> and <HI>Semidei Manes,</HI> you know
where; for if once you get so near the moon, Sapho
will want your presence in the clouds, and inferior
regions; not to mention the great loss Drury-lane
will sustain, when Mr. Cromwell is in the Milky
Way. These celestial thoughts put me in mind of
the priests you mention, who are a sort of Sortilegi
in one sense, because in their lottery there are more
blanks than prizes; the adventurers being at best in
an uncertainty, whereas the setters up are sure of
something. Priests indeed in their character, as
they represent God, are sacred; and so are con∣stables
as they represent the king; but you will own
a great many of 'em are very odd fellows, and the
devil a bit of likeness in 'em. Yet I do assure you,
I honour the good as much as I detest the bad, and
I think, that in condemning these, we praise those.
I am so far from esteeming ev'n the worst unworthy
of my protection, that I have defended their cha∣racter
(in Congreve's and Vanbrugh's plays) ev'n
against their own brethren. And so much for priests
in general. Now for Trapp in particular, whose
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
translations from Ovid I have not so good an opi∣nion
of as you; not (I will assure you) on account
of any sort of prejudice to him as a priest, but be∣cause,
I think, he has nothing of the main cha∣racteristick
of his author, a graceful easiness. For
let the sense be never so exactly render'd, unless an
author looks like himself in his air, habit, and
manner, 'tis a disguise and not a translation. But as
to the Psalm, I think David is much more beholding
to him than Ovid; and as he treated the Roman like
a Jew, so he has made the Jew speak like a Roman.</P>
<P>Your mention in this and your last letter of the
defect in numbers of several of our poets, puts me
upon communicating a few thoughts, or rather
doubts of mine on that head, some of which 'tis
likely I may have hinted to you formerly in con∣versation:
but I will here put together all the little
niceties I can recollect in the compass of my ob∣servation.</P>
<P>(1.) As to the Hiatus, it is certainly to be avoided
as often as possible; but on the other hand, since
the reason of it is only for the sake of the numbers,
so if, to avoid it, we incur another fault against their
smoothness, methinks the very end of that nicety is
destroy'd: as when we say (for instance)</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="75"/>
“But th' old have interest ever in their view.”</P>
<P>To avoid the Hiatus, in—</P>
<P>—“The old have int'rest”—</P>
<P>Does not the ear in this place tell us, that the Hiatus
is smoother, less constrain'd, and so preferable to the
Caesura?</P>
<P>(2.) I wou'd except against all expletives in verse,
as <HI>do</HI> before verbs plural, or ev'n too frequent use of
<HI>did</HI> or <HI>does,</HI> to change the termination of the rhime;
all these being against the usual manner of speech,
and meer fillers up of unnecessary syllables.</P>
<P>(3.) Monosyllable-lines, unless very artfully ma∣nag'd,
are stiff, languishing, and hard.</P>
<P>(4.) The repeating the same rhimes within four or
six lines of each other; which tire the ear with too
much of the like sound.</P>
<P>(5.) The too frequent use of Alexandrines, which
are never graceful but when there is some majesty
added to the verse by 'em, or when there cannot be
found in 'em a word but what is absolutely needful.</P>
<P>(6.) Every nice ear must (I believe) have ob∣serv'd,
that in any smooth English verse of ten syl∣lables,
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
there is naturally a pause at the fourth, fifth,
or sixth syllable; as for example, Waller.</P>
<L>At the fifth.</L>
<L>“Where-e'er thy navy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spreads her canvass wings,”</L>
<L>At the fourth.</L>
<L>“Homage to thee <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and peace to all she brings.”</L>
<L>At the sixth.</L>
<L>“Like tracts of leverets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in morning snow.”</L>
<P>Now I fancy, that to preserve an exact harmony
and variety, none of these pauses shou'd be continu'd
above three lines together without the interposition of
another; else it will be apt to weary the ear with one
continu'd tone; at least it does mine.</P>
<P>(7.) It is not enough that nothing offends the ear,
that the verse be (as the French call it) <HI>coulante;</HI> but
a good poet will adapt the very sounds, as well as
words, to the things he treats of. So that there is
(if one may express it so) a style of sound: as in
describing a gliding stream, the numbers shou'd run
easy and flowing; in describing a rough torrent or
deluge, sonorous and swelling; and so of the rest.
This is evident every where in Homer and Virgil,
and no where else that I know of to any observable
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
degree. The following examples will make this very
plain, which I have taken from Vida.</P>
<Q><L>Molle viam tacito lapsu per laevia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque sonoras.</L>
<L>Immenso cum praecipitans ruit oceano nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle sine ictu, conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape saxa manu, cape robora, pastor.</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas, date tela, repellite pestem.</L></Q>
<P>This, I think, is what very few observe in practice,
and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting
the image on the reader: we have one excellent
example of this in our language, Mr. Dryden's Ode
on St. Caecilia's day, entitled, Alexander's Feast; or,
The Power of Musick.</P>
<P>I ask your pardon for this tedious Letter, and ex∣pect
a long one in answer to these notions concern∣ing
the versification. I expect also the voyage of
Ovid's mistress with more impatience than Ovid
himself cou'd her return. The other journey you
speak of (mine to London) must yet be deferr'd;
but tho' I desire nothing more than to enjoy the hap∣piness
of your conversation, yet I have too much
conscience to let mine cost you any thing but your
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
patience. I am heartily sorry for poor Mr. Wy∣cherley's
illness, and 'tis to his being long indispos'd
that I partly attribute his chagrin. I wish he may
enjoy all the happiness he desires, tho' he has been
the occasion of my enjoying much less than I did
formerly. I look upon your kindness to me as doubly
engaging at this time, and shall never cease to ac∣knowledge

<P>IF my letter pleas'd you, yours
overjoy'd me; and I expect impatiently your kind
visit: a little room and a little heart are both at your

at least, tho' not happy. For you shall go just your
own way, and keep your own hours, which is more
than can be done often in places of greater enter∣tainment.—As
to your letter of Critical Remarks on
Dryden's Virgil, I can only say, most of what you
observe are true enough, but of no great consequence
(in my opinion at least.) Line 250. “And sanctify
the shame”—seems to me very beautiful; and so
does—“'tis doubly to be dead.” Line 946. “And
bandy'd words still beat about his ears.”—This
I have thought gross as well as you. I agree with
you that the 993d line, “And clos'd her lids at last
in endless night”—is contradictory to the sense of
Virgil; for so, as you say, Iris might have been
spar'd. And in the main 'tis to be consess'd that
the translator has been freer with the character of
Dido than his modest author wou'd allow. I am just

<P>I Receiv'd your most welcome letter,
and am asham'd you shou'd seem to give us thanks,
where you ought to assure us of pardon for so ill an
entertainment. Your heroick intention of flying to
the relief of a distressed lady, was glorious, and
noble; such as might be expected from your cha∣racter,
for as Chaucer says (I think)
<Q><L>“As noblest metals are most soft to melt,</L>
<L>So pity soonest runs in gentle minds.”</L></Q></P>
<P>But what you tell me of her relation's account of
the state of her mind, is not to be wonder'd at.
'Tis the easiest way they have to make some seeming
excuse for a shameful indolence and neglect of af∣flicted
virtue, to represent it as willing to suffer, and
endure the cross. Alas! Sir, these good people of
large estates, and little souls, have no mind to ease
her, by bearing it off her shoulders by a generous
assistance! Our Saviour himself did not refuse to be
eas'd of the weight of part of his cross; tho' per∣haps
Simon of Cyrene might alledge to the Jews
that 'twas Christ's desire to bear it all himself; and
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
he, for his part, might be willing to go quietly on
his journey, without the trouble.—</P>
<P>Be pleas'd to assure Mr. Ballam of my faithful
service: I can never enough esteem a zeal so ardent
in my concerns, from one I never cou'd any way
oblige, or induce to it. 'Tis an effect of the purest,
most disinterested strain of natural good-humour in
the world. Pray at your leisure return me those
papers in my hand which you have, and in Mr.
Wycherley's, and favour me as often as you can

while I write this period, I escape some hundred
fatal darts from those unerring eyes, and about a

in dying, wou'd not once have dreamt of an absent
friend in these circumstances; you that are so nice

moving postures she pleases. Indeed, indeed, my

and my Essay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Criticism.</NOTE> for the other? I wou'd lay
out all my Poetry in Love; an Original for a Lady,
and a Translation for a Waiting Maid! <HI>And now

<Q><L>Tell me, by all the melting joys of love,</L>

<L>By all these tender adjurations tell me,</L>

<HI>And would not these lines sound admirably in the mouth
of Wilks, especially if he humour'd each period with his
leg, and stamp'd with just alacrity at the cadences? But</HI>
alas! what have I to do with Jane Gray, as long as
Miss Molly, Miss Betty, or Miss Patty are in this
world? Shall I write of beauties murder'd long ago,
when there are those at this instant that murder me?
I'll e'en compose my own Tragedy, and the poet
shall appear in his own person, to move compassion.
'Twill be far more effectual than Bays's entering with
a rope about his neck, and the world will own,
there never was a more miserable object brought upon
the stage.</P>
<P>Now you that are a critic, pray inform me in what
manner I may connect the foregoing part of this
Letter, with that which is to follow, according to
the rules? I wou'd willingly return Mr. Gay my
thanks for the favour of his poem, and in particular
for his kind mention of me; I hop'd, when I heard
a new comedy had met with success upon the stage,
that it had been his, to which I really wish no less;
and (had it been any way in my power) shou'd have
been very glad to have contributed to its introduc∣tion
into the world. His verses to Lintot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On a Miscellany of Poems.</NOTE> have
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
put a whim into my head, which you are like to be
troubled with in the opposite page. Take it as you
find it, the production of half an hour t'other morn∣ing.
I design very soon to put a task of a more seri∣ous
nature upon you, in reviewing a piece of mine
that may better deserve criticism; and by that time
you have done with it, I hope to tell you in person,
with how much ardour and fidelity I am,</P>

Dr. Arbuthnot is a strange creature; he goes out of

I have long been so far mistaken in him as to think
him a man of morals as well as of politics. Pray
let him know I made a very unfashionable enquiry

things that (I presume) are below the consideration of
a wit and an Ombre-player. They are in perfect

<P>SINCE by your letter we find
you can be content to breathe in smoke, to walk in
crouds, and divert yourself with noise, nay, and to
make fine pictures of this way of life, we should
give you up as one abandon'd to a wrong choice of
pleasures. We have, however, so much compassion
on you, as to think of inviting you to us, where
your taste for books, friendship, and ease may be in∣dulg'd.
But if you do not come, pray leave to
tempt us with your description of the court, for in∣deed
humanity is frail, and we cannot but remember
some particular honours which we have enjoy'd in
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
conversation; bate us this one point, and we stand
you, still untir'd with one another, and fresh to the
pleasures of the country. If you wou'd have any
news from us, know that we are all well at present:
this I am sure wou'd have been allow'd by you as
news from either of us a fortnight ago. In return
to this, send us every thing you imagine diverting,
and pray forget not my commissions. Give my
respects to the Dean, Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Ford,
and the Provost. Dear Gay, adieu.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. POPE to Mr. GAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER>DEAR MR. GAY,</OPENER>
<P>ABOVE all other news, send us
the best, that of your good health, if you enjoy it;
which Mr. Harcourt made us very much fear. If
you have any design either to amend your health, or
your life, I know no better expedient than to come
hither, where you should not want room though I
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
lay myself in a truckle-bed under the Doctor. You
might here converse with the old Greeks, be ini∣tiated
into all their customs, and learn their prayers
by heart as we have done: The Doctor, last Sunday,
intending to say Our Father, was got half way in
Chryses' prayer to Apollo. The ill effects of con∣tention
and squabbling, so lively describ'd in the first
Iliad, make Dr. Parnelle and myself continue in the
most exemplary union in every thing. We deserve
to be worshipp'd by all the poor, divided, factious,
interested poets of this world.</P>
<P>As we rise in our speculations daily, we are grown
so grave, that we have not condescended to laugh at
any of the idle things about us this week: I have
contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation
on high subjects, equal to the formidable front of
black-brow'd Jupiter, and become an awful nod as
well, when I assent to some grave and weighty pro∣position
of the Doctor, or inforce a criticism of my
own. In a word, Y—g himself has not acquir'd
more tragic majesty in his aspect by reading his own
verses, than I by Homer's.</P>
<P>In this state I cannot consent to your publication
of that ludicrous trifling burlesque you write about.
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
Dr. Parnelle also joins in my opinion, that it will by
no means be well to print it.</P>
<P>Pray give (with the utmost fidelity and esteem) my
hearty service to the Dean, Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr.
Ford, and to Mr. Fortescue. Let them also know
at Button's that I am mindful of them. I am,

nothing to a fit of illness.</P>
<P>Dr. Parnelle will honour Tonson's miscellany with
some very beautiful copies, at my request. He enters
heartily into our design: I only fear his stay in town
may chance to be but short. Dr. Swift much ap∣proves
what I propos'd, even to the very title, which

<P>It appears from manuscripts of Mr. Pope,

sufficiently shew, that her mode of spelling gave him more

The pleasure such a good old woman must have felt in
writing over verses, which she justly thought would
confer immortality on her son, is more easy to be conceived

filial tenderness, which forms perhaps the most captivating

so does that malignant air of calumny soonest at∣tack

low and weak, for bowing and moving to and fro,
are by their weakness secure from the danger and

<P>I Would not have failed by Tuesday's

as to the time, but yesterday we met on horse-back
and took two or three turns near the camp, partly
to see my new horse's going, and partly to name
something like the day of setting forth, and the
manner thereof: viz. that on Thursday next (God
willing) Doctor A—, D. Disney, and C. Jervas
rendevouz at Hyde-Park-corner about noon, and
proceed to Mr. Hill's, at Eggam, to lodge there on
Friday, to meet with Mr. Pope upon the road to
proceed together to Lord Stowell's, and there also
to lodge. The next day, Saturday, to Sir William
Windham's, and to rest there the Lord's day. On
Monday, forward again towards Bath, or Wilton,
or as we shall then agree. The Doctor proposes
that himself or his man ride my spare horse, and
that I leave all equipage to be sent to Bath by the
carrier with your portmanteau. The Doctor says he
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
will allow none of his friends so much as a night∣gown
or slippers for the road, so a shirt and cravat
in your pocket is all you must think of in his new
scheme. His servant may be bribed to make room
for that. You shall have a shorter and less bridle
sent down on Saturday, and the other shall be re∣turned
in due time. The taylor shall be chastised if
'tis really negligence in his art, but if 'tis only
vapours, you must beg pardon. The linnen and
stockings out of your portmanteau may go with the
bridle. I forgot to tell you that the third day is to
be Oxford University, and the Monday following to

besides the common uncertainty from the present
situation of this world, in which we have a small

in contradiction to a journey of pleasure. The

his loving a bottle, which is alike grateful at all

<HEAD>Three Hours after Marriage:
A
COMEDY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is well known that the <HI>Three Hours after Marriage</HI> was damn'd as soon as acted. Though Mr. Gay's name appears singly in the Advertisement prefixed to it, it is certain that Pope and Arbuthnot had an equal hand in the performance.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract from a Letter of Mr. CIBBER to Mr. POPE, published in the Year 1742.</HEAD>
<P>“The Play of The Rehearsal, which had lain some few years dormant, being by his present Majesty (then Prince of Wales) commanded to be revived, the part of Bays fell to my share. To this character there had always been allow'd such ludicrous liberties of obser∣vation, upon any thing new, or remarkable, in the state of the Stage, as Mr. Bays might think proper to take. Much about this time then, the <HI>Three Hours after Marriage</HI> had been acted without success; when Mr. Bays, as usual, had a fling at it, which, in itself, was no jest, unless the audience would please to make it one: but however, flat as it was, Mr. Pope was mortally sore upon it. This was the offence. In this Play, two cox∣combs, being in love with a learned virtuoso's wife, to get unsuspected access to her, ingeniously send them∣selves, as two presented rarities, to the husband, the one curiously swath'd up like an Egyptian Mummy, and the other slily cover'd in the Paste-board skin of a Crocodile: upon which poetical expedient, I, Mr. Bays, when the two Kings of Brentford came from the clouds into the throne again, instead of what my part directed me to say, made use of these words, viz. Now, Sir, this revolution, I had some thoughts of in∣troducing, by a quite different contrivance; but my design taking air, some of your sharp wits, I found, had made use of it before me; otherwise I intended to have stolen one of them in, in the shape of a <HI>Mummy,</HI> and t'other, in that of a <HI>Crocodile.</HI>” Upon which, “I doubt, the audience by the roar of their applause shew'd their proportionable contempt of the Play they belong'd to. But why am I answerable for that? I did not lead them, by any reflection of my own, into that contempt: surely to have used the bare word <HI>Mummy,</HI> and <HI>Crocodile,</HI> was neither unjust, or unman∣nerly; where then was the crime of simply saying there had been two such things in a former Play? but this, it seems, was so heinously taken by Mr. Pope, that, in the swelling of his heart, after the Play was over, he came behind the scenes, with his lips pale and his voice trembling, to call me to account for the insult: and accordingly fell upon me with all the soul language, that a wit out of his senses could be capable of—How durst I have the impudence to treat any gentleman in that manner? &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Now let the reader judge by this concern, who was the true mother of the child! when he was almost choked with the foam of his passion, I was enough recover'd from my amazement to make him (as near as I can remember) this reply, viz.” ““Mr. Pope—You are so particular a man, that I must be asham'd to return your language as I ought to do: but since you have attacked me in so monstrous a manner; this you may depend upon, that as long as the Play continues to be acted, I will never fail to repeat the same words over and over again.”</P>

a rupture in her understanding. I took her
into my house to regulate my oeconomy; but instead
of puddings, she makes pastorals; or when she should
be raising paste, is raising some ghost in a new tragedy.
In short, my house is haunted by all the underling
players, broken booksellers, half-voic'd singing-masters,

<P>Susanna Townley! Susanna Townley! Look how
runs the warrant you drew up this morning.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Clerk gives him a paper.</STAGE>
<P>Madam, a word in private with you. <STAGE>[Whispers her.]</STAGE>
Doctor, my Lord Chief Justice has some business
with this lady.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOSSILE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord Chief Justice business with my wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POSSUM.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, doctor Fossile, you have
for these three hours entertain'd another man's wife.
Her husband, lieutenant Bengal, is just returned
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
from the Indies, and this morning took out a warrant
from me for an elopement; it will be more for your
credit to part with her privately, than to suffer her
publickly to be carry'd off by a tipstaff.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOSSILE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprizing have been the events of this day; but
this, the strangest of all, settles my future repose.
Let her go—I have not dishonoured the bed of
lieutenant Bengal—Hark ye friend! Do you follow
her with that badge of her infamy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POSSUM.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your favour, doctor, I never reverse my judg∣ment.
The child is yours: for it cannot belong
to a man who has been three years absent in the
East-Indies. Leave the child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SAILOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find you are out of humour, master. So I'll
call to-morrow for his clearings.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Sailor</HI> lays down the child, and exit with
<HI>Possum,</HI> Clerk, and <HI>Townley.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLINKET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Uncle, by this day's adventure, every one has
got something. Lieutenant Bengal has got his wife
again; you a fine child; and I a plot for a comedy;
and I'll this moment set about it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Clinket.</STAGE>
<SP>
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
<SPEAKER>FOSSILE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must be, must be. <STAGE>[Takes up the child.]</STAGE>
Fossile, thou didst want posterity: here behold thou
hast it. A wife thou didst not want; thou hast none.
But thou art caressing a child that is not thy own.
What then? A thousand, and a thousand husbands
are doing the same thing this very instant; and the
knowledge of truth is desirable, and makes thy case
the better. What signifies whether a man beget his
child or not? How ridiculous is the act itself, said
then great emperor Antonius! I now look upon my∣self
as a Roman citizen; it is better that the father
should adopt the child, than that the wife should
adopt the father.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE ancient Epilogue, as critics write,</L>
<L>Was, clap your hands, excuse us, and good-night.</L>
<L>The modern always was a kind essay</L>
<L>To reconcile the audience to the Play:</L>
<L>More polish'd, we of late have learnt to fly</L>
<L>At parties, treaties, nations, ministry.</L>
<L>Our author more genteelly leaves these brawls</L>
<L>To coffee-houses, and to coblers stalls.</L>
<L>His very monsters are of sweet condition,</L>
<L>None but the Crocodile's a politician;</L>
<L>He reaps the blessings of his double nature,</L>
<L>And, Trimmer like, can live on land or water:</L>
<L>Yet this same monster should be kindly treated,</L>
<L>He lik'd a lady's flesh—but not to cat it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As for my other spark, my favourite Mummy,</L>
<L>His feats were such, smart youths! as might become ye;</L>
<L>Dead as he seem'd, he had sure signs of life;</L>
<L>His hieroglyphicks pleas'd the doctor's wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whom can our well-bred poetess displease?</L>
<L>She writ like quality—with wond'rous ease:</L>
<L><PB N="276" REF="280"/>
All her offence was harmless want of wit;</L>
<L>Is that a crime?—ye powers, preserve the pit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My doctor too, to give the devil his due,</L>
<L>When ev'ry creature did his spouse pursue,</L>
<L>(Men sound and living, bury'd flesh, dry'd fish,)</L>
<L>Was e'en as civil as a wife could wish.</L>
<L>Yet he was somewhat saucy with his vial;</L>
<L>What, put young maids to that unnat'ral trial!</L>
<L>So hard a test! why, if you needs will make it,</L>
<L>Faith, let us marry first,—and then we'll take it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who could be angry, though like <HI>Fossile</HI> teaz'd?</L>
<L>Consider, in three hours, the man was eas'd.</L>
<L>How many of you are for life beguil'd,</L>
<L>And keep as well the mother, as the child!</L>
<L>None but a Tar could be so tender-hearted,</L>
<L>To claim a wife that had been three years parted;</L>
<L>Would you do this, my friends?—believe me, never:</L>
<L>When modishly you part—you part for ever.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Join then your voices, be the Play excus'd</L>
<L>For once, though no one living is abus'd;</L>
<L>To that bright circle that commands our duties,</L>
<L>To you superior eighteen-penny beauties,</L>
<L>To the lac'd hat and cockard of the pit,</L>
<L>To all, in one word, we our cause submit,</L>
<L>Who think good breeding is a-kin to wit.</L>
