<L>HAIL! <HI>Hi'roglyphick</HI> State <HI>Machin,</HI></L>
<L>Contriv'd to Punish Fancy in:</L>
<L>Men that are Men, in thee can feel no Pain,</L>
<L>And all thy <HI>Insignificants</HI> Disdain.</L>
<L>Contempt, that false New Word for shame,</L>
<L>Is without Crime, an empty Name.</L>
<L>A Shadow to Amuse Mankind,</L>
<L>But never frights the Wise or Well-fix'd Mind:</L>
<L>Virtue despises Humane Scorn,</L>
<L>And Scandals Innocence adorn.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Exalted on thy <HI>Stool of State,</HI></L>
<L>What Prospect do I see of Sov'reign Fate;</L>
<L>How the <HI>Inscrutables</HI> of Providence,</L>
<L>Differ from our contracted Sence;</L>
<L>Here by the Errors of the Town,</L>
<L>The Fools look out, the Knaves look on.</L>
<L>Persons or Crimes find here the same respect,</L>
<L>And Vice does Vertue oft Correct,</L>
<L>The undistinguish'd Fury of the Street,</L>
<L>With Mob and Malice Mankind Greet:</L>
<L>No Byass can the Rabble draw,</L>
<L>But <HI>Dirt</HI> throws <HI>Dirt</HI> without respect to Merit, or to Law.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes the <HI>Air of Scandal</HI> to maintain,</L>
<L><HI>Villains</HI> look from thy Lofty Loops in Vain:</L>
<L>But who can judge of Crimes by Punishment,</L>
<L>Where Parties Rule, and L....s Subservient.</L>
<L>Justice with Change of Int'rest Learns to bow,</L>
<L>And what was Merit once, is Murther now:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Actions receive their Tincture from the Times,</L>
<L>And as they change are Vertues made or Crimes.</L>
<L>Thou art the <HI>State-Trap</HI> of the Law,</L>
<L>But neither canst keep Knaves, nor Honest Men in Awe;</L>
<L>These are too hard'nd in Offence,</L>
<L>And those upheld by Innocence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How have thy <HI>opening Vacancys</HI> receiv'd,</L>
<L>In every Age the Criminals of State?</L>
<L>And how has Mankind been deceiv'd,</L>
<L>When they distingnish Crimes by Fate?</L>
<L>Tell us, <HI>Great Engine,</HI> how to understand,</L>
<L>Or reconcile the Justice of the Land;</L>
<L>How <HI>Bastwick, Pryn, Hunt, Hollingsby</HI> and <HI>Pye,</HI></L>
<L>Men of unspotted Honesty;</L>
<L>Men that had Learning, Wit and Sence,</L>
<L>And more than most Men have had since,</L>
<L>Could equal Title to thee claim,</L>
<L>With <HI>Oats</HI> and <HI>Fuller,</HI> Men of later Fame:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Even the Learned <HI>Selden</HI> saw,</L>
<L>A Prospect of thee, thro' the Law:</L>
<L>He had thy <HI>Lofty Pinnacles</HI> in view,</L>
<L>But so much Honour never was thy due:</L>
<L>Had the Great <HI>Selden</HI> Triumph'd on thy Stage,</L>
<L><HI>Selden</HI> the Honour of his Age;</L>
<L>No Man wou'd ever shun thee more,</L>
<L>Or grudge to stand where <HI>Selden</HI> stood before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou art no shame to Truth and Honesty,</L>
<L>Nor is the Character of such defac'd by thee,</L>
<L>Who suffer by Oppressive Injury.</L>
<L>Shame, like the Exhalations of the Sun,</L>
<L>Falls back where first the motion was begun:</L>
<L>And he who for no Crime shall on thy Brows appear,</L>
<L>Bears less Reproach than they who plac'd him there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if Contempt is on thy Face entail'd,</L>
<L>Disgrace it self shall be asham'd;</L>
<L>Scandal shall blush that it has not prevail'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
To blast the Man it has defam'd.</L>
<L>Let all that merit equal Punishment,</L>
<L>Stand there with him, and we are all Content.</L>

<LG>
<L>There would the Fam'd <HI>S—ll</HI> stand,</L>
<L>With Trumpet of Sedition in his Hand,</L>
<L>Sounding the first <HI>Crusado</HI> in the Land.</L>
<L>He from a Church of <HI>England</HI> Pulpit first</L>
<L>All his Dissenting Brethren Curst;</L>
<L>Doom'd then to Satan for a Prey,</L>
<L>And first found out <HI>the shortest way;</HI></L>
<L>With him the Wise Vice-Chancellor o'th' Press,</L>
<L>Who, tho' our Printers Licences defy,</L>
<L>Willing to show his forwardness,</L>
<L>Bless'd it with his Authority;</L>
<L>He gave the Churche's Sanction to the Work,</L>
<L>As <HI>Popes</HI> bless Colours for Troops which fight the <HI>Turk.</HI></L>
<L>Doctors in scandall these are grown,</L>

Professors in Reproach and highly fit,</L>

<L>Thou like a True-born <HI>English</HI> Tool,</L>

<L>Who Guide us with unsteady hand:</L>
<L>Who Armies, Fleets, and Men betray;</L>
<L>And Ruine all <HI>the shortest way.</HI></L>
<L>Let all those Souldiers stand in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight,</L>
<L>Who're Willing to be paid and not to fight.</L>
<L>Agents, and Collonels, who false Musters bring,</L>

<L>Bring all your <HI>Coward Captains</HI> of the Fleet;</L>
<L>Lord! What a Crow'd will there be when they meet?</L>

They who let <HI>Pointi</HI> 'scape to <HI>Brest,</HI></L>
<L>With all the Gods of <HI>Carthagena</HI> Blest.</L>
<L>Those who betray'd our <HI>Turkey</HI> Fleet;</L>

<L>Who miss'd the Squadron from <HI>Thouloon,</HI></L>
<L>And always came too late or else too soon;</L>
<L>All these are Heroes whose great Actions Claim,</L>
<L>Immortal Honours to their Dying Fame;</L>
<L>And ought not to have been Denyed,</L>
<L>On thy <HI>great Counterscarp,</HI> to have their Valour try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why have not these upon thy <HI>spreading Stage,</HI></L>
<L>Tasted the keener Justice of the Age;</L>
<L>If 'tis because their Crimes are too remote,</L>
<L>Whom leaden-footed Justice has forgot?</L>
<L>Let's view the modern Scenes of Fame,</L>
<L>If Men and Management are not the same;</L>
<L>When Fleets go out with Money, and with Men,</L>
<L>Just time enough to venture home again?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
Navyes prepar'd to guar'd th' insulted Coast,</L>
<L>And Convoys settl'd when Our Ships are lost.</L>
<L>Some Heroes lately come from Sea,</L>
<L>If they were paid their Due, should stand with thee;</L>
<L>Papers too should their Deeds relate,</L>
<L>To prove the Justice of their Fate:</L>
<L>Their Deeds of War at <HI>Port Saint Mary</HI>'s done,</L>
<L>And set the Trophy's by them, which they won:</L>
<L>Let <HI>Or—d's</HI> Declaration there appear,</L>
<L>He'd certainly be pleas'd to see 'em there.</L>
<L>Let some good Limner represent,</L>
<L>The ravish'd Nuns, the plunder'd Town,</L>
<L>The <HI>English</HI> Honour how mispent;</L>
<L>The shameful coming back, and little done.</L>

<LG>
<L>The <HI>Vigo</HI> Men should next appear,</L>
<L>To Triumph on <HI>thy Theater;</HI></L>
<L>They, who on board the Great Galoons had been,</L>
<L>Who rob'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> first, and then the Queen:</L>

Set up the praises to their Valour due,</L>
<L>How Eighty Sail, had beaten Twenty two.</L>
<L>Two Troopers so, and one Dragoon,</L>
<L>Conquer'd a <HI>Spanish</HI> Boy, at <HI>Pampalone.</HI></L>
<L>Yet let them <HI>Or—d's</HI> Conduct own,</L>
<L>Who beat them first on Shore, or little had been done:</L>
<L>What unknown spoils from thence are come,</L>
<L>How much was brought away, <HI>How little home.</HI></L>
<L>If all the Thieves should on <HI>thy Scaffold</HI> stand</L>
<L>Who rob'd their Masters in Command:</L>

<L>Upon thy <HI>Penitential stools,</HI></L>
<L>Some People should be plac'd for Fools:</L>
<L>As some for Instance who while they look on;</L>
<L>See others plunder all, and they got none.</L>
<L>Next the Lieutenant General,</L>
<L>To get the Devill, lost the De'll and all;</L>
<L>And he some little badge should bear,</L>
<L>Who ought, in Justice, to have hang'd 'em there:</L>

This had his Honour more maintain'd,</L>

<L><HI>Jobbers,</HI> and <HI>Brokers</HI> of the City Stocks,</L>

<L>And so in Charity agree,</L>
<L>He keeps two Brace of Whores, two Stallions she.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What need of <HI>Satyr</HI> to Reform the Town?</L>
<L>Or Laws to keep our Vices down?</L>
<L>Let 'em <HI>to Thee</HI> due Homage pay,</L>
<L>This will Reform us all <HI>the Shortest Way.</HI></L>
<L>Let 'em <HI>to thee</HI> bring all the Knaves and Fools,</L>
<L>Vertue will guide the rest by Rules;</L>
<L>They'll need no Treacherous Friends, no breach of Faith,</L>
<L>No Hir'd Evidence with their Infecting Breath;</L>
<L>No Servants Masters to Betray,</L>
<L>Or Knights o'th' Post, who Swear for Pay;</L>
<L>No injur'd Author 'll on thy Steps appear,</L>
<L>Not such as <HI>won't be Rogues,</HI> but such <HI>as are.</HI></L>

<L>The first Intent of Laws</L>
<L>Was to Correct th' Effect, and check the Cause;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
And all the Ends of Punishment,</L>
<L>Were only Future Mischiefs to prevent.</L>
<L>But Justice is Inverted when</L>
<L>Those Engines of the Law,</L>
<L>Instead of pinching Vicious Men,</L>
<L>Keep Honest Ones in awe;</L>
<L>Thy Business is, as all Men know,</L>
<L>To Punish Villains, not to make Men so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When ever then thou art prepar'd,</L>
<L>To prompt that Vice thou should'st Reward,</L>
<L>And by the Terrors of thy <HI>Grisly Face,</HI></L>
<L>Make Men turn Rogues to shun Disgrace;</L>
<L>The End of thy Creation is destroy'd,</L>
<L>Justice expires of Course, and Law's made void.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What are thy Terrors? that for fear of thee,</L>
<L>Mankind should dare to sink their Honesty?</L>
<L>He's Bold to Impudence, that dare turn Knave,</L>
<L>The Scandal of thy Company to save:</L>
<L>He that will Crimes he never knew confess,</L>
<L>Does more than if he knew those Crimes transgress:</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that fears thee more than to be base,</L>
<L>May want a <HI>Heart,</HI> but does not want a <HI>Face.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Thou like the Devil dost appear</L>
<L>Blacker than really thou art by far:</L>
<L>A wild Chimerick Notion of Reproach,</L>
<L>Too little for a Crime, for none too much:</L>
<L>Let none th' Indignity resent,</L>
<L>For Crime is all the shame of Punishment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou <HI>Bug-bear</HI> of the Law stand up and speak,</L>
<L>Thy long Misconstru'd Silence break,</L>
<L>Tell us who 'tis upon <HI>thy Ridge</HI> stands there,</L>
<L>So full of Fault, and yet so void of Fear;</L>
<L>And from the Paper in his Hat,</L>
<L>Let all Mankind be told for what:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell them it was because he was too bold,</L>
<L>And told those Truths, which shou'd not ha' been told.</L>
<L>Extol the Justice of the Land,</L>
<L>Who Punish what they will not understand.</L>
<L>Tell them he stands Exalted there,</L>
<L>For speaking what we wou'd not hear;</L>
<L>And yet he might ha' been secure,</L>
<L>Had he said less, or wou'd he ha' said more.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
Tell them that this is his Reward,</L>
<L>And worse is yet for him prepar'd,</L>
<L>Because his Foolish Vertue was so nice</L>
<L>As not to sell his Friends, according to his Friends Advice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thus he's an Example made,</L>
<L>To make Men of their Honesty afraid,</L>
<L>That for the time to come they may,</L>
<L>More willingly their Friends betray;</L>
<L>Tell 'em the M—that plac'd him here,</L>
<L>Are Sc—ls to the Times,</L>
<L>Are at a loss to find his Guilt,</L>
<L>And can't Commit his Crimes.</L>
