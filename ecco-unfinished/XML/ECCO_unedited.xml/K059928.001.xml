<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>In presenting to the Public a View of
Switzerland, a country of which so much
has been already written, it may perhaps
become me to clear myself from the charge
of presumption. The descriptive parts of
this journal were rapidly traced with the
ardor of a fond imagination, eager to seize
the vivid colouring of the moment ere it
fled, and give permanence to the emotions
of admiration, while the solemn enthusiasm
beat high in my bosom; but when the sen∣sations
excited by those views of majesti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
grandeur had subsided, I recollected, with
regret, that the paths which I had delighted
<PB REF="4"/>
to tread had been trodden before; and that
the objects on which I had gazed with
astonishment had been already described.
It is true, that the sketch I have penciled of
that sublime scenery, however rude, will be
found to be an original drawing, copied
from nature, and not from books; yet I
should scarcely have presumed to obtrude
that unfinished outline on the public eye,
if the other parts of my journal offered no∣thing
new to its observation. It is the pre∣sent
moral situation of Switzerland that jus∣tifies
the appearance of these volumes, in
which an attempt is made to trace the im∣portant
effects which the French Revolution
has produced in that country, and which
are about to unfold a new aera in its history.
The governments of Switzerland, placed
within reach of the electrical fire of that
Revolution, flashing around all their bor∣ders,
behold the subtle spark, which finds a
conductor in the human heart, escaping be∣yond
<PB REF="5"/>
its prescribed limits, and feel its strong
concussion in every agitated nerve.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to give an additional
interest to my journal, by connecting the
view of the manners and customs of the
Swiss towns, with a comparative picture
of the present state of Paris; and I offer
this Work to the Public with far less hope
from the experience of its past indulgence,
than solicitude to obtain its future favor.</P>

<P>DURING the period of that new species
of tryranny which assumed the name of revo∣lutionary
government, I was not merely in∣volved
in the common danger which threat∣ened
every individual in France, but had
claims to particular proscription. It was not
only remembered by many of the satellites of
Robespierre, that I had been the friend of the
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
Gironde, of Madame Roland, martyred
names which it was death to pronounce,
but that I had written a work, published in
England, in which I had traced, without
reserve, the characters of our oppressors;
whose ferocious purposes I had often heard
developed with the glowing eloquence of
Vergniaud, and the indignant energy of
La Source. No danger could be more im∣minent
than that of living under the very
tyranny which I had the perilous honour
of having been one of the first to deprecate,
and to proclaim.</P>
<P>In this situation an opportunity presented
itself of obtaining a passport for Switzerland
—A passport!—they who can judge of all
the blessedness that word unfolds, are not
those who, at a safe distance from the go∣vernment
of Robespierre, have heard of its
terrific influence, but those who were placed
within its savage grasp. Alas! at the mo∣ment
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
of my escape, how many, immured in
the dungeons of the tyrant, vainly wished
to purchase, at the price of all they posses∣sed,
the privilege of forsaking a country,
composed only of executioners and of
victims!</P>
<P>The road from Paris to Basil leads for
the most part along a level country, which
displays a picture of fertility, but few scenes
of beauty or grandeur, except a branch of
the Vosges, which we traversed near Bel∣fort,
and whose swelling mountains, pre∣senting
faint traces of those we were going
to contemplate, we saw bounding our ho∣rizon,
and stretching along the plains of
Alsace.</P>
<P>I found Basil crouded with strangers of
all ranks, and all nations, being, at that
period, when general hostility had barred
the passes from one country to another, al∣most
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
the only spot left open for the trans∣actions
of commerce, the asylum of the
fugitives, and the dawning negociations of
peace.</P>
<P>The first view of Switzerland awakened
my enthusiasm most powerfully—“At
length,” thought I, “am I going to con∣template
that interesting country, of which
I have never heard without emotion!—I
am going to gaze upon images of nature;
images of which the idea has so often
swelled my imagination, but which my
eyes have never yet beheld.—I am going
to repose my wearied spirit on those sublime
objects—to sooth my desponding heart with
the hope that the moral disorder I have
witnessed shall be rectified, while I gaze
on nature in all her admirable perfections;
and how delightful a transition shall I find
in the picture of social happiness which
Switzerland presents! I shall no longer see
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
liberty profaned and violated; here she
smiles upon the hills, and decorates the
vallies, and finds, in the uncorrupted simpli∣city
of this people, a firmer barrier than in
the cragginess of their rocks, or the snows
of their Glaciers!”</P>
<P>Such were my meditations when I first
set my foot on the soil of Switzerland; the
scenery of the country more than fulfilled
the glowing promise of imagination. With
respect to the character and manners of the
people, a residence of several weeks at Basil
somewhat chilled my enthusiasm: I had
frequent opportunities of mixing in their
societies, and discerned neither the love of
arts, of literature, of liberty, or of any
earthly good, but money—I heard of no∣thing
but the comparative value of louis,
and assignats; and if I had not seen the
Rhine rolling its turbulent waves majesti∣cally
by the windows, I might have fan∣cied
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
myself in 'Change-alley, or the Perron
of the Palais Royal.</P>
<P>But if I was disappointed, it was perhaps
my own fault, or rather the fault of former
travellers. Warmed with enthusiasm for
the natural beauties of the country, fancy,
which loves the dreams of happiness and
perfection, has delighted to associate with
those enchanting scenes the charm of conge∣nial
society; and to connect with the sub∣lime
landscape the higher qualities of mind.
Imagination places stock-jobbers and usurers
with as much reluctance amidst the gran∣deur
of Swiss scenery, as it would fill with
a mishapen Gothic image the niche of a
Grecian temple. It must be indeed admit∣ted,
that the love of gold is a taste pretty
generally diffused throughout Europe; that
neither the inhabitants of Paris nor of Lon∣don
can be taxed with any remarkable indif∣ference
for riches; nor have wealthy persons
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
in either of those capitals any reason to
complain of the neglect of their fellow citi∣zens.
But although the people of most
countries are, with respect to the researches
of gain, burghers of Basil, during the hours
of the morning, the evening at least is de∣voted
to amusement, to social pleasure, to
friendship, to some object that cheers, or
sooths the heart, and the projects of interest
are laid aside till the morrow. At Basil
alone, the toils of trade find no relaxation;
they begin with the day, but do not finish
at its close; since even the hours of recrea∣tion
are made subservient to the views of
interest; and the only species of amuse∣ment
in which the burghers of that city in∣dulge
themselves, is one at which they
can arrange their commercial dealings, strike
bargains, and vigorously pursue that main
chance which appears to be, their “being's
end, and aim.”</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19"/>
With those views, the men have formed
themselves into different societies, called
<HI>tabagies,</HI> or smoking-clubs, because all the
members smoke most furiously. Each club
is composed of nearly the same age, a custom
to which the love of equality perhaps gave
rise, but which is observed to be extremely
prejudicial to the manners of the young men
of Basil, by excluding all forms of deference
and politeness, as well as all means of im∣provement.
With respect to these things,
there is indeed nothing peculiar to the clubs
of Basil; since from Brooke's, composed of
the honourable members of the British par∣liament,
to these tabagies, filled with the
senators of the laudable Helvetic Body, a
man who has long frequented such meetings
becomes entirely unfit for all other society;
he soon thinks it an hardship to pass an
evening elsewhere, and terms all other
company constraint, because it wants the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of a tavern, where tumult is mistaken
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
for gaiety, and familiarity for friendship.
But while in other places the taste for clubs
is confined to a few persons, Basil is a
town of clubbists, containing no less than
twelve smoking societies, each composed of
about sixty members, who meet every af∣ternoon
at an early hour, drink tea amidst
the exhilarating fumes of tobacco, discuss
the political situation, but far more indefa∣tigable
the commercial affairs of the town,
calculate the gains and losses of the day,
form new schemes of acquiring wealth,
and separate at the hour of supper before
they have said one word on any subject of
taste, or literature.</P>
<P>The ladies of Basil, abandoned by the
men, have recourse to clubs also, and some∣times
twenty ladies assemble together with∣out
one man being of the party, although to
such as present themselves, admittance, far
from being refused, is even gratefully ac∣corded;
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
and sometimes a stranger taking
advantage of the posture of affairs at Basil,
which leads a coterie of young handsome
women to consider his company as a favour,
pays his homage to the ladies, while clouds
of other incense are rising in every quarter
of the town from the tabagies where their
absent husbands are convened.</P>
<P>The female societies of Basil are formed
from infancy of children of the same age,
and of the same class; and during their
childhood, the equality of years is so strictly
observed in these societies, that sisters, whose
ages differ three or four years, have their
separate coteries in the same house. There
is something soothing in the idea of these
infant associations; it seems forming ano∣ther
barrier for our helpless sex, against the
future tempests of the world; and no doubt
many a fair member of these young socie∣ties,
when assailed by those storms of mis∣fortune,
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
which often beat with the most pi∣tiless
fury against hearts that can least resist
their violence, recalls with tender regret
the social circle of her childhood; and per∣haps
finds in the sympathy of some female
companion, to whom she is endeared by the
charm of those early recollections, a source
of consolation and relief. The young un∣married
women, and the dowagers, have all
their distinct circles, sometimes increased by
the admission of sisters-in-law, who become
part of the family, and sometimes by the
introduction of accidental acquaintances.</P>
<P>They assemble by invitation successively
at each other's houses, usually at three in the
afternoon; an hour which, though morn∣ing
with respect to dinner, and all the busy
occupations of life at London and Paris,
finds the day far advanced at Basil; where
dinner is served, when it is noon, by the
clocks of that city, which, for several cen∣turies
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
past, have kept the van-guard of
time, and for some reason, forgotten in the
lapse of ages, probably because not worth
being remembered, strike twelve in defiance
of common sense and convenience, when the
solar shadow points eleven.</P>
<P>The ladies present themselves at their co∣teries
with their work-bags upon their arms,
and work and conversation begin together;
the latter turns, as in other uninstructed
minds, upon the every-day gossip of ordi∣nary
life. When the domestic detail of
houshold anecdote, and the tattle of town
scandal fail, they hasten to cards—what
other resource is left? Time cannot be filled
up, as it often is in mixed societies, by the
flutter of coquetry, and the arts of affecta∣tion
on one side, and by the offices of galan∣try,
or the stare of libertinism on the other.</P>
<Q><L>“Where none admire, 'tis useless to excel;</L>
<L>Where none are Beaux, 'tis vain to be a Belle.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="13" REF="24"/>
At these assemblies she place of honor is
at the window, to which in every house at
Basil convex mirrors are fixed, and give a
view of all that is passing the streets to a
considerable distance. These mirrors, con∣sulted
every moment by the ladies of Basil,
not to view themselves, but their neigh∣bours,
would have furnished Thomson, had
he lived in that city, with another image in
his castle of indolence, of the means of mur∣dering
time.</P>
<P>Tea is brought at four in the afternoon,
accompained by an handsome collation, con∣sisting
of pastry, fruits, creams, and sweet∣meats,
and often of ham, and other cold
meats. This substantial kind of refresh∣ment
is not found unacceptable after a very
copious dinner, and with the perspective of
a solid supper; the Swiss in general being
possessed of a most powerful appetite, per∣haps
arising from the keenness of their
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
mountain air. A dull game of commerce
drags on the lingering hours till eight in the
evening, when the ladies separate, after a
profusion of compliments, which they have
not yet relinquished for the French mode of
gliding out of the room.</P>
<P>Sometimes their Liege-Lords, the clubbists,
make a sacrifice of one dear evening of
smoke and stock-jobbing, to the women;
on these gala occasions, the card-party con∣cludes
with a supper, sufficiently luxurious,
but which might be more amusing; and
as the law forbids any carriages to roll
through the streets after eleven, the com∣pany
usually separate at that hour.</P>
<P>Fathers and mothers of families, who
have children married, fix one day of the
week, which they call <HI>leur jour de famille,</HI>
when all their offspring assemble at their
house at dinner, sometimes to the fourth,
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
fifth, and even sixth generation; for the
women marry very young, and not long
since there were not less than six ladies in
Basil, whose grand-children were grand∣mothers.
There is something respectable,
and even affecting in these patriarchal meet∣ings;
they seem a means of drawing closer
those ties of consanguinity which are the
best refuge against human ills; in which
the purest affections of the heart mingle
themselves with the wants and weakness of
our nature; guiding with watchful tender∣ness
the wanderings of youth, and support∣ing
with unwearied care the feebleness of
age.</P>
<P>The public amusements of Basil were
suspended by the magistrates, we were told,
on account of the public calamities; the
chief of which was the dearness of pro∣visions:
an evil the more easily to be
borne, as the town was then reaping an
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
abundant harvest of gold from the calami∣ties
of other countries. Once a week indeed,
the dulness of a card assembly was permitted
to replace that of the coteries; and an occa∣sional
concert harmonized the soul; but
dancing was a diversion too light for the
times, and even a set of dancing-dogs, of∣fending
against the statute, were formally
expelled by the <HI>Chasse-Coquin,</HI> probably in
consequence of the general order of the Com∣mission
of Six, instituted at that period for
clearing the town of unprofitable strangers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Comparative View of the Spirit of Commerce in France, be∣fore,
and since the Revolution.—Paper System.—Female
Traders and Contractors.</HEAD>
<P>IN France, a country so near Switzerland
in its geographical situation, but so dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
in the character and disposition of the peo∣ple,
things in this respect are managed bet∣ter;
and although the French are lately be∣come
in some sort also a nation of usurers
and stock-jobbers, their mode of toiling for
wealth, and their mode of spending it, are
altogether different from the plodding usages
of their neighbours.</P>
<P>The revolution which destroyed monar∣chy
in France, overthrew at the same time
the empire of ancient prejudices and habits.
Before that event, vanity was the govern∣ing
spring of French action, and the prin∣cipal
aim, and aliment of that vanity, was
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
rank and titles. A trader only laboured to
procure just money enough to purchase a
charge of treasurer of France, or <HI>secretaire
du roi,</HI> and when thus honourably ennobled,
considered it as beneath his dignity to con∣tinue
any longer that commerce which had
served as the step-ladder to his elevation.</P>
<P>But the scene is now reversed. Nobility
exists no longer, and opinions have under∣gone
as great a revolution as titles and for∣tunes.
The poor are enriched; the rich
are impoverished; labour is become neces∣sary;
industry flourishes on the ruins of
vanity; and, as the impetuous French are
ever in extremes, their ancient disdain of
mercantile occupations is succeeded by a
sort of rage for commerce. To this new
fury they are animated, not only by the
call of necessity, but by the desire of en∣joyment.
This people, the ever ardent
lovers of pleasure, pant to repair those mo∣ments
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
of terror and desolation which were lost
to their accustomed, their beloved gaieties.
They seek amusement with new eager∣ness,
and the dangers which they find at∣tendant
on a revolution, only serve to attach
them mote to the present moment, on the
Epicurean principle of uncertainty respect∣ing
the future.</P>
<P>Immense commercial resources are found
in the fertility, the extent, the situation, and
the wants of the French Republic; but
nothing can be more amusing than the va∣rious
whimsical directions into which the
active, restless genius of the people, have
turned their present rage for traffic. All
grasp at something strange, and something
great; a new world seems opening to their
view, and which all model after their own
fashion. Every man has seized upon some
profound discovery, some happy specula∣tion,
which will infallibly pour forth an
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
ever-flowing stream of inexhaustible wealth.
When one chimera fails, another swiftly
springs up; all is “bubble, bubble, toil
and trouble;” spurred by hope, or goaded
by want, every man mounts the hobby-horse
of his imagination, and whips it up
to some marvellous atchievement.</P>
<P>One citizen frames stoves of paper more
durable than brass or steel; another erects
mills that scorn the aid of fire, wind, or
water; another extracts new chemical sub∣stances,
which, when applied to commerce,
are to produce riches beyond the visions of
the alchemists. All announce that they
have set their inventive talents upon the
anvil, merely for the good of their country;
and as the ideas which the revolution has
awakened, have given every individual in
France some floating notions of his own
importance, every man, however ignorant
or mistaken, boldly brings forward his in∣fallible
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
plan, insists upon his right of
being heard by his fellow-citizens, and
calls upon every capitalist to hasten to
him with his funds, and calculate, if he
can, the enormous mass of interest with
which the wings of every moment will be
loaded.</P>
<P>Those who decline setting up as invent∣ors,
and enlightening the world by disco∣veries,
although they refuse to travel
through unknown tracts of commercial
enterprize, at least engage in more beaten
paths of gain. Throughout the wide ex∣tent
of the Republic, Gothic abbies are
transformed into manufactories, cloisters
become work-shops, chapels are converted
into warehouses, the recesses of solitary
superstition are invaded, and the hollow
echoes of the long-resounding aisles, which
were once only responsive to the solemn
slow-breathed chant, now repeat the rude
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
dissonance of the workman's tools. A
strange confusion of images is excited in
the mind by the present contemplation of
these antique edifices, which imagination
has been accustomed to appropriate to con∣genial
inhabitants, pacing silently along
their vaulted passages in floating garments,
instead of which you now meet the bare-armed,
brawny artificer, and all ideas of
solemn stillness vanish amidst the rude
gabble of his noisy brood. No doubt an
artisan is far more useful than a monk, but
he looks much less picturesque when placed
beneath a ruined arch, and gazed at in per∣spective.</P>
<P>While speculators in the country are
converting abbies into manufactories, spe∣culators
in Paris are perhaps, on a surer
principle of calculation, transforming palaces
into resorts of public amusement, so new,
so various, and so Grecian in all their plans
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
and designations, that to trace a slight sketch
of them will require one of our whole fol∣lowing
chapters.</P>
<P>The system of paper-money contributed
to cherish the new spirit of speculation in
France, by suffering the imagination to rove
amidst ideal regions of visionary wealth.
The most trifling purchase or transaction,
at that period, had somthing in it of sound∣ing
greatness; a pair of shoes cost a thou∣sand
livres, an ell of ribband five hundred;
and as the women in France have even more
active spirits than the men, every lady who
had fifty, or a hundred thousand livres in
her pocket-book, considered herself as a
sort of capitalist; and hearing incessantly
from all parts, and in all directions, that
commerce was the infallible road to wealth,
immediately set up with those solid funds
some species of trade. One lady provided
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
herself with a cargo of pocket handker∣chiefs,
another with an assortment of
shoes; some sold tallow-candles, some
wax; some dealt in powder, and others
in snuff; but all had their little traffic, all
were animated by the same restless spirit of
gain. This species of commerce, however,
was of fleeting duration. Sterne has ob∣served,
that Frenchmen conceive, better than
they combine; still more justly may this
observation be applied to French women;
who, when they became adventurers in the
new world of traffic, exulted in the rapid
augmentation of their wealth; and were
astonished to find that the merchandize,
which was to replace the stock, could no
longer be purchased with the same capi∣tal;
till at length they discovered, that
their magnificent commercial profits were
a sort of fairy-gold, which, when touch∣ed,
turned to sand; and that it was not
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>
the merchandize which had increased in
price, but the assignats that had diminished
in value.</P>
<P>A few of the most beautiful, and the
most intriguing of the fair Parisians, be∣came
the agents and emissaries of their
friends, lovers, or husbands, in the public
offices; and the marine, the war, and the
home-departments, were filled with female
contractors and negociators, who, for the
most part, found that republican committees
made no better defence than polished courts,
against the formidable artillery of bright
eyes, gay smiles, lively sallies, and ani∣mated
graces; artillery which French wo∣men
know better how to wield, than the
women of any other country. Ministers
and commissaries felt the energy of argu∣ments
uttered by ruby lips, and the claims
of a petition offered by a soft hand, of
which the naked well-shaped arm was
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
gracefully stretched out; and, upon the
whole, the women of France, to whom,
by the Constitutional Act, all rights have
been denied, find that they still hold a to∣lerably
despotic empire over their lords and
masters, the sovereign people.</P>
<P>Of a different class from these female ne∣gociators
and merchants, were those women,
who, once possessed of all that rank and for∣tune
could bestow, were now reduced to sup∣ply
the pressing wants of the moment, by a
melancholy species of traffic; by selling
various pieces of ornamental needle-work,
which they had once been taught to execute
as an amusement, or by making a profes∣sion
of those arts which they had once ac∣quired
as the accomplishments of an elegant
education. Above all, drawing has proved
an useful resource in these circumstances.
Many a lady has found in her pencil, a
means of subsistence for herself and family;
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
many a finished landscape, destined to grace
a crystal <HI>boudoir,</HI> or decorate a gilded pa∣villion,
has served to furnish the fair artist
with the crust of bread which, in some
lonely garret, she moistens with her tears.

<P>IF the morning at Paris is devoted to busi∣ness,
the evening at least belongs to plea∣sure:
over those hours she holds an undivid∣ed
empire, but is worshipped at innumer∣able
altars, and hailed by ever-varying
rituals.</P>
<P>During the last winter the amusements
of twenty-four theatres, which were opened
every night, were every night succeeded by
public and private balls, in such numbers,
that there were no less than two thousand
ball-rooms inscribed on the registers of the
police, which keeps its wakeful vigils over
every sort of amusement, in all their grada∣tions,
from the bright blaze of waxen tapers
which displays the charms of nymphs
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
dressed <HI>à la sauvage,</HI> or <HI>à la grec,</HI> who
grace the splendid ball <HI>de Richlieu;</HI> to the
oily lamp which lights up the seventh story,
or the vaulted cellar, where the blind fidler's
animating scrape calls the sovereign people
to the cotillon of wooden shoes.</P>
<P>These two thousand ball-rooms of the
capital afford ample proof that no revolu∣tion
has taken place in the manners of the
French, and that they are still a dancing
nation. They have indeed of late fully de∣monstrated
to the world that they are capa∣ble
of greater things; and that when the
energies of their souls are called forth, they
can follow Buonaparte across the bridge of
Lodi; but when their minds return to their
natural position, every barrack has a room
appropriated for dancing, and the heroes of
Arcole, as well as the <HI>muscadins</HI> of Paris,
<Q><L>“All knit hands, and beat the ground</L>
<L>In a light fantastic round.”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41"/>
The fetes of the court, it is asserted by
the few persons remaining in France, by
whom they were frequented, were but taw∣dry
splendour compared with the classical
elegance which prevails at the fetes of our
republican contractors. As a specimen of
these private balls, I shall trace a short sketch
of a dance lately given by one of the fur∣nishers
of stores for fleets and armies, in his
spacious hotel, where all the furniture, in
compliance with the present fashion at Pa∣ris,
is antique; where all that is not Greek
is Roman; where stately silken beds, massy
sophas, worked tapestry, and gilt ornaments,
are thrown aside as rude Gothic magnifi∣cence,
and every couch resembles that of
Pericles, every chair those of Cicero; where
every wall is finished in arabesque, like the
baths of Titus, and every table, upheld by
Castors and Polluxes, is covered with Athe∣nian
busts and Etruscan vases; where
that modern piece of furniture a clock is
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
concealed beneath the classic bar of Phoebus,
and the dancing hours; and every chim∣ney-iron
is supported by a Sphinx, or a
Griffin. The dress of his female visitors
was in perfect harmony with the furniture
of his hotel; for although the Parisian
ladies are not suspected of any obstinate at∣tachment
to Grecian modes of government,
they are most rigid partizans of Grecian
modes of dress, adorned like the contem∣poraries
of Aspasia—the loose light drapery,
the naked arm, the bare bosom, the sandaled
feet, the circling zone, the golden chains,
the twisting tresses, all display the most in∣flexible
conformity to the laws of republi∣can
costume. The most fashionable hair∣dresser
of Paris, in order to accommodate
himself to the classical taste of his fair cus∣tomers,
is provided with a variety of an∣tique
busts as models; and when he waits
on a lady, enquires if she chuses to be drest
that day <HI>à la Cleopatre, la Dianne,</HI> or <HI>la
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
Psyche?</HI> Sometimes the changeful nymph
is a vestal, sometimes a Venus; but the last
rage has been the <HI>Niobé,</HI> of late fat and
lean, gay and grave, old and young, have
been all <HI>à la Niobé;</HI> and the many-curled
periwig, thrown aside by the fashionable
class, now decorates the heads of pretty
shop-keepers.</P>
<P>The fair Grecians being determined not
to injure the contour of fine forms by su∣perfluous
incumbrances, no fashionable
lady at Paris wears any pockets, and the
inconvenience of being without is obviated
by sticking her fan in her belt, sliding in a
flat purse of morocco leather, only large
enough to contain a few louis, at the side of
her neck, and giving her snuff-box and her
pocket-handkerchief to the care of the gen∣tleman
who attends her, and to whom she
applies for them whenever she has occa∣sion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="44"/>
For a short time during the winter, in
defiance of frost and snow, the costume of
a few reigning belles was not <HI>à la grec,</HI> but
<HI>à la sauvage.</HI> To be dressed <HI>à la sauvage,</HI>
was to have all that part of the frame which
was not left uncovered clad in a light dra∣pery
of flesh colour. The boddice under
which no linen was worn (shifts being an
article of dress long since rejected at Paris,
both by the Greeks and the Savages) the
boddice was made of knitted silk, clinging
exactly to the shape, which it perfectly dis∣played;
the petticoat was on one side
twisted up by a light festoon; and the feet,
which were either bare or covered with a
silk stocking of flesh colour, so woven as to
draw upon the toes like a glove upon the
fingers, were decorated with diamonds.
These gentle savages, however, found them∣selves
so rudely treated whenever they ap∣peared,
by the sovereign multitude, that at
length the fashions of Otaheite were thrown
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
aside, and Greece remains the standing order
of the day.</P>
<P>But to return to the contractor, and his
ball—after several hours had past in danc∣ing
cotillons, which the young women of
Paris perform with a degree of perfection—
a light nymphish grace unseen elsewhere—
and after the walse, which is now never
forgotten at a Paris ball, had proved that
the steady heads of Niobés were not to be
made giddy, the company were led to a
supper furnished with Eastern magnificence,
and decorated with attic taste. After sup∣per
the folding doors of the saloon were
thrown open to a garden of considerable ex∣tent,
beautifully illuminated with coloured
lamps, and its trees bending with lavish
clusters of fruits of every season, and every
climate, formed of ice, while fountains
poured forth streams of orgeat, lemonade,
and liqueurs.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46"/>
But while these imitators of Greece and
Rome are revelling in Asiatic luxury, you
hear them lamenting most pathetically the
subversion of the ancient regime; that re∣gime,
which would at least have had thus
much of justice, that it would have retained
these personages in the anti-chambers of the
saloons they now occupy; to which anti∣chambers
they would with a counter-revo∣lution
most probably return. One is obliged
to offer up an invocation to patience, when
condemned to listen to their declamations
against that new order of things to which
solely they owe their elevation.</P>
<P>There is indeed one class of persons, be∣fore
whose complaints of the revolution,
however bitter, the mind humbles itself in
sympathetic sorrow. The poor <HI>rentier,</HI>
while he sips his Spartan black-broth,
which he is forced to procure by parting, in
sad gradation, with all the relicks of his
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>
former splendour, with watches, rings,
furniture, and clothes: he indeed, if he com∣plains,
is to be pitied, and if he forbears
complaint, is to be revered! But alas, there
is so much of tragical detail in the pages of
the <HI>great book;</HI> a thing which has long
since been called a great evil, that we must
give it at least a whole chapter to itself.</P>
<P>At present I shall only observe, that the
reign of terror has acted upon this country
like some mighty pestilence, which not only
sweeps away devoted millions in its fury,
but leaves an obnoxious taint upon every
object where it has passed. The reign of
terror has given a fatal wound to the ener∣gies
of public spirit; ordinary minds have
mistaken the execrable abuses of liberty for
an effect of the generous principle itself:
the victims of revolutionary government
have lifted up their complaining voice; all
the emotions of sympathy, and all the feel∣ings
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
of indignation have been called forth;
and the partizans of the ancient regime have
left no art unpractised, no seduction un∣tried,
to take advantage of these dispositions
in favor of their own system.</P>
<P>Those who have been too rapidly enrich∣ed
by the revolution have endeavoured to hide
the obscurity of their origin, by mimicking
the tones of those who have titles and honors
to regret, till aristocracy has descended so
low, that it will soon perhaps be exploded,
like any other fashion, when taken up by
the vulgar. Many of the fair wives of
titled emigrants, or blooming widows of
murdered nobles, who have made such se∣cond
marriages, that we might well apos∣trophize
them in the language of Hamlet:
<Q><L>“Such an act</L>
<L>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</L>
<L>Calls virtue hypocrite,</L>
<L>Makes marriage vows</L>
<L>As false as Dicers' oaths.”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="49"/>
These very ladies, who have taught their
new-made Liege-Lords to ape their counter-revolutionary
follies, will at length be
ashamed of their aristocracy, when they
find how successfully they are rivalled in
those sentiments by their milliners and man∣tua-makers.
A writer of a late political
pamphlet has given an admirable reason
why our Parisian belles will soon lay aside
the tone of eternal lamentations for the
overthrow of despotism. “Seven years,”
says he, “have already elapsed since the
epocha of the revolution: seven years is a
period of some length in the history of a
youthful beauty, and a lady will soon not
be able to regret the monarchy under the
penalty of passing for old.” I believe every
person who has studied the female heart,
will agree with this writer, that the re∣public
has a tolerable chance upon this prin∣ciple
of obtaining ere long many fair pro∣selytes.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="50"/>
The fans, sparkling with spangled <HI>fleurs
de lys,</HI> will then be broken; the rings,
bearing the insignia of royalty, will be
melted down; and the <HI>porte-feuilles,</HI> and
<HI>bon-bonnieres,</HI> with their sliding-lids, dis∣playing
the forbidden images of regal great∣ness,
will no longer be borne about in a sort
of triumphal manner, not from a sentiment
of sorrow, by those who, attendant on their
persons, and basking in their smiles, are
privileged to display more than that gene∣ral
regret for their unhappy destiny which
humanity feels; but from a sensation of va∣nity
by those, who perhaps never breathed
the same atmosphere; never, even at awful
distance, gazed upon the originals of those
pictures which they now affect to cherish
as the tender memorials of peculiar favor.
These relicks, we may venture to predict,
will be offered up in one mighty sacrifice
at the shrine of the republic, the moment
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
it is well understood that to be a republi∣can,
is to be young.</P>
<P>Public balls, as well as concerts, were
held last winter at the <HI>Theatre Français,</HI>
which, after having been long shut up, was
repaired, embellished, and baptized by the
Greek name of the <HI>Odeon;</HI> and that no jea∣lousy
might exist between the balls and con∣certs,
on account of this classical nomencla∣ture,
the balls immediately received the ap∣pellation
of <HI>thiases.</HI></P>
<P>But the most singular species of amuse∣ment
which the last winter produced, were
subscription-balls, entiled <HI>des bals à la vic∣time.</HI>
Such, and so powerful was the rage
for pleasure, that a certain number of its
votaries, who, during the tyranny of Ro∣bespierre,
had lost their nearest relations on
the scaffold, instituted, not days of such
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
solemn, sad commemoration, as is dear to
the superstition of tenderness, when, in
melancholy procession, clad in sable, and
wreathed with cypress, they might have knelt,
a mourning multitude, around the spot where
the mutilated bodies of their murdered pa∣rents
had been thrown by the executioner;
and bathed the sod with those bitter tears
which filial affection, or agonized love, shed
over the broken ties of nature, or of pas∣sion—
no!—the commemorative rites which
these mourners offered to the manes of their
massacred relations, were festive balls! To
these strange, unhallowed orgies, no one
could be admitted who had not lost a father,
a mother, a husband, a wife, a brother, or
a sister, on the guillotine; but any person
with a certificate of their execution in his
pocket-book, not only obtained admission,
but might dance as long, and as merrily as
heart could wish. Had Holben been pre∣sent
at such a spectacle, no doubt he would
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
have enriched his death-dance with new
images, and led forward each gay nymph
by an attendant headless spectre. The in∣dignant
cry of public opinion, however,
was at length heard above the music of the
walse and the cotillon; and the <HI>bal à la
victime</HI> exists no longer to bear its powerful
testimony to a depravation, not merely of
manners, but of the heart.</P>
<P>If in the winter, conformably to our Gre∣cian
ideas at Paris, concet-rooms became
<HI>Odeons,</HI> and the Niobés and the Titus's
danced in a <HI>thiase,</HI> summer can boast of
more than equal honors; since then we
never tread but on attic ground, and never
suffer ourselves to be pleased but when plea∣sure
presents herself with a classical appel∣lation.
Witness ye gardens of Tivoli, ye
bowers of Idalia, ye winding walks of Ely∣sium,
ye grottos of Venus, ye vales of
Tempe, ye groves of Thessaly! witness
<PB N="43" REF="54"/>
with what fond alacrity the lovers of anti∣quity
fly in multitudes to your enchanting
recesses, where the arching trees are hung
with innumerable lamps of varying colours,
where the ear is exhilarated with the sounds
of music, and the eye is cheared with the
movements of the dance; and where every
evening the hour of ten serves as a general
sigual, at which the whole city of Paris
seems one vast theatre for the display of
fireworks. A stranger who should enter
this city at night by the bridge of Neuilly,
might suppose that he had reached this
scene of great events at some important
epocha, which had occasioned a general re∣joicing.
On his right he would discern
the lights of <HI>Bagatelle,</HI> beaming through
the <HI>Bois de Boulogne,</HI> and would pass close
to the brilliant entrace of Idalia; on his
left he would be dazzled by the illumina∣tions
of the Elysium; while, as he ad∣vanced,
he would discern, above every
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
quarter of the town, the tall sky-rockets
darting their vivid flash, and would hear in
all directions the light explosions of en∣chanted
palaces, with bright arcades and
fairy columns;
<Q><L>“The crackling flames appear on high,</L>
<L>And driving sparkles dance along the sky.”</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Bagatelle</HI> alone, the once gay retreat of
the Comte d'Artois, is suffered, by our
Grecian amateurs, to retain its old appella∣tion
in favour of the regal images which it
brings to memory. What food for the
ramblings of the mind along the paths of
history, when it contrasts the light French
modern graces of Bagatelle, with the massy,
Gothic gloom of Holyrood-House! It
may be observed, that the persons who are
for ever lamenting the subversion of the
ancient regime, are not prevented by
their regrets from giving all the encou∣ragement
in their power to those who
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
convert one palace after another into scenes
of public amusement; and that they eager∣ly
purchase for half a crown, the privilege
of treading gaily every evening with the
plebeian multitude, those magnificent gar∣dens
and sumptuous hotels, of which the
possessors have, for the most part, as in for∣mer
proscriptions, paid for their beautiful
retreats at Alba, with their lives. But
while these lovers of despotism forget their
regrets in their pleasures, the philosophic
mind wanders often in musing mood along
these festive haunts, where the most singu∣lar
combinations croud upon reflection; and,
amist the glowing enthusiasm of liberty,
mourns those partial evils that have clouded
its brightness, and abhors those cruel abuses
that have sullied its cause!</P>
<P>When the multiplied engagements of the
evening do not offer leisure for an excursion
to Tivoli, or a trip to Idalia, the gay world
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
at least find sufficient time in the interval be∣tween
the play and the <HI>petit souper,</HI> to lounge
for half an hour at one of the fashionable
<HI>glaciers.</HI> A glacier is a sort of coffee-house,
established in the fine hotels of emigrants,
splendidly illuminated, open to persons of
both sexes, and where you pay for your
admission by eating ices, for which there is
now so extraordinary a demand in Paris,
that if the following winter should prove
mild, the ice-purveyors will perhaps be
forced to send to the department of Mont
Blanc, in order to furnish themselves with
means of supplying the enormous wants of
their customers.</P>
<P>But let me recall the images most dear to
my imagination, by leaving for a while the
glaciers of Paris, and the smoking-clubs of
Basil, and wandering amidst the sublime
landscapes of Switzerland. How delight∣ful
to bid adieu to every-day occurrences,
<PB N="47" REF="58"/>
occupations, cares, and pleasures, for the
contemplation of those scenes of solemn
grandeur, which form such a contrast to
the littleness of ordinary life! Let me turn
my steps towards the first august object
which struck my eye in Switzerland, the
cataract of the Rhine at Schaff hausen, to
which place I was obliged to travel by a
long circuitous route to Zurich, since with
French passports the Austrian territory was
forbidden ground. A Balois told me be∣fore
my departure, that the cataract of the
Rhine was scarcely worth so much trouble;
since, “after all,” said he, “it is but a fall
of water!”

<P>THROUGH what a delicious country we
passed in travelling along the Canton of
Basil to that of Soleure! What beautiful,
what various combinations of rock, pine∣clad
hills thrown together in noble masses,
and richly covered with their dark-tinted
verdure; above which a bare peak some∣times
lifts its sharp spiral head, as if to
give effect to the landscape.</P>
<P>What grateful sounds to my ear were the
murmurs of those soothing cascades, and
clear rills which had more of beauty than
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
sublimity, but which filled my heart with
emotion, while I considered them as the
prelude of scenes, where the water-fall swells
into a torrent, and where, instead of rapid
brooks, and small streams, the borad lake
spreads its majestic expanse of waters.</P>
<P>I was yet only in the vestibule of Swit∣zerland,
and nature appeared to me as if
lifting up gradually the veil which con∣cealed
those mighty objects of overwhelm∣ing
grandeur, which my imagination sprung
forward to meet with enthusiastic rapture.
We passed by several country houses, with
pleasure-grounds covered with verdant seats,
bowers, and arbours, profanely cut into all
the mishapen forms of Gothic fury, and
where literally,
<Q><L>“Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother,</L>
<L>And half the platform justs reflects the other.”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="65"/>
One might forgive a Dutchman for clip∣ping
his trees, and squaring his walks by
the same rule with which he cuts his ca∣nals,
and digs his ditches; but here, in the
very temple of nature, where the inhabitant
has but to cast his eye around him in order
to learn all that she can teach of grace and
majesty, it seems difficult to avoid feeling,
that <HI>jets-d' eaux</HI> are but ludicrous mimickry
in the neighbourhood of cataracts, that
bouquets of yew, and pillars of fir, lose
much of their effect when placed beneath
hanging woods of pines, and columns of
cliffs, and that the romantic hills above are
an eternal satire on the trim walks below.</P>
<P>In our way to Schaffhausen, we spent
some agreeable days with a small party, at
a farm-house in the Canton of Basil, situated
in the nook of a mountain. High hills
rise sloping round this little white dwell∣ing,
covered with fine pasturage, and scat∣tered
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
over with trees, woody copses, and
swift rivulets flowing down their green
sides. An Irish gentleman, who had hired
apartments in this habitation for the sum∣mer,
and whom we went to visit, had cut
winding paths along the steep hills with his
own hands, directed the fresh springs to
flow into cool baths, and placed Italian,
Latin, and French inscriptions upon the
trees, in the charming recesses of the hang∣ing
woods.</P>
<P>When our good farmer bought his
ground, its appendages of woods, cliffs,
and rills, had probably only entered into his
speculations, so far as they were the means
or the impediments of culture; but an
English nobleman would have purchased
them with half his fortune. During our
stay in this beautiful retreat we, lived with
the farmer and his family, eat of their
<PB N="52" REF="67"/>
bread, drank of their cup, and found per∣fect
neatness, as well as plentiful hospita∣lity
at their table.</P>
<P>The farmer, a plain, honest, sensible
Swiss, was proud of his country, and above
all, proud of his privileges, as he happened
to be a burgher of Basil. He produced a
kind of placard, which had been in his fa∣mily,
he said, for ages; and we observed
that the date was in the middle of the
fifteenth century. On this large placard
was not ill engraven all the memorable his∣torical
events of Switzerland, since it began
its struggles for freedom, with poetry below,
explaining more fully the atchievements
which the painting related above. Our far∣mer
felt his soul animated, and himself
half a warrior, while he gazed on these
glorious triumphs of his ancestors. I was,
perhaps, the more struck with his enthu∣siasm,
<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
because it was the first time I had
observed any such sentiment since my arri∣val
in Switzerland.</P>
<P>In the commercial parts of that country,
this feeling of pride in the feats of their
progenitors is as completely extinct as the
heroic race itself, which is long since gone
to the family-vault of all the Capulets; but
in the little or ancient Cantons which were
the cradle of Swiss liberty, this generous
sentiment is still cherished. The peasants
teach their children the oral tale of other
times, and they early imbibe with the love
of their own country an inveterate hatred
against Austria. The memory of those va∣lorous
deeds is also impressed on the mind
by coarse paintings, which cover the walls
of the peasants' houses, and are sometimes
so large as narrowly to escape the fate of
the Vicar of Wakefield's family picture.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69"/>
The farmer also recounted to me some
of the rustic solemnities which are practised
in the Canton of Basil, where the peasants
crown with heaps of flowers the hive
which produces the first swarm of bees;
and when the cows first go to grass in the
spring, and leave it in the autumn, a long
procession is formed of two cows abreast,
whose horns are gayly decorated for the
gala, aud who are led on by two white
cows most profusely covered with wreaths,
and ribbands of various colours. This
custom, I am told, is as ancient as the days
of Theocritus, who talks of adorning his
favorite cow with chaplets.</P>
<P>Many a traditionary tale gives a moral in∣terest
to the picturesque scenes of this en∣chanting
country. In one of our airings
on horseback, during our stay at the farm∣house,
we passed through a defile, above
which rose piles of cliffs five hundred feet
<PB N="55" REF="70"/>
high, and on the brow of one those tower∣ing
craggs we discerned the ruins of a Go∣thic
castle, two windows of which still re∣main.
“There,” said our guide, point∣ing
to the frowning summit of the rock,
“some ages past lived a tyrant: he de∣lighted
in desolation and death, and when∣ever
any of his vassals offended him, he or∣dered
them to appear before him, and then
caused the unhappy victims to be thrown
headlong from yonder horrible precipice
into this gulph below. Three centuries
since his vassals had their revenge; they
armed themselves, climbed up at night by
almost inaccessible paths to the castle, which
they surprized, and set on fire, and the
tyrant perished in the flames.”</P>
<P>We left, with regret, the farmer's white
dwelling, and crossing a part of the chain
of Jura, proceeded on our journey to Ba∣den,
which is the Bath of Switzerland,
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
celebrated for the virtues of its hot springs,
and is much frequented in summer; but
there are no public meetings, and the com∣pany
associate little together. The town is
surrounded by lofty green hills; and the
Limat flows at their feet with an impetu∣ous
rapidity, which seems to realize the
poetical idea of living waters. We walked
along a narrow path along the edge of the
river to a limpid fountain, where the
country girls, dressed in the picturesque
costume of the female Swiss peasantry,
came to draw water, and gave a more
pastoral air to the scene. Bidding farewel
to Badeu, where we had been received by
Mr. Barthelemy, the French Ambassador,
with elegant hospitality, we pursued our
course to Zuric.</P>
<P>This neat, and chearful town, is divided
into two parts by the Limat, and delight∣fully
situated on the northern extremity of
<PB N="57" REF="72"/>
its noble lake, which spreads, far as the
eye can reach, its mass of limped waters,
bounded by vine-covered hills, whose slopes
are thick-studded with houses and villages;
while beyond this scene of picturesque
beauty, the Alps, covered with their eter∣nal
snows, rise in the distant perspective,
stretching towards the south-west, and
mingling their summits with the clouds.
It was not without the most powerful emo∣tion
that, for the first time, I cast my eyes
on that solemn, that majestic vision, the
Alps!—how often had the idea of those
stupendous mountains filled my heart with
enthusiastic awe!—so long, so eagerly, had
I desired to contemplate that scene of won∣ders,
that I was unable to trace when first
the wish was awakened in my bosom—it
seemed from childhood to have made a part
of my existence—I longed to bid adieu to
the gayly-peopled landscapes of Zuric, and
wander amidst those regions of mysterious
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
sublimity, the solitudes of nature, where her
eternal laws seem at all seasons to forbid
more than the temporary visits of man, and
where, sometimes, the dangerous passes to
her frozen summits are inflexibly barred
against mortal footsteps. The pleasure aris∣ing
from the varying forms of smiling beauty
with which we were surrounded, became a
cold sensation, while expectation hung upon
those vast gigantic shapes, that half-seen
chaos which excited the stronger feelings of
wonder, mingled with admiration. But I was
obliged, with whatever regret, to relinquish
for the present a nearer view of those tre∣mendous
objects, since private affairs left
me only sufficient leisure to visit the cataract
of the Rhine before I returned to Basil;
whence, however, I soothed myself with
the hope of being soon able to depart
in search of the terrific scenes of the Alps,
and the rich luxuriant graces of the Italian
vallies of Switzerland. In the mean time
<PB N="59" REF="74"/>
we passed hastily through Zuric, in our way
to Schaffhausen, for although I had been
assured that the cataract of the Rhine was
“but a fall of water,” it had excited so
tormenting a curiosity, that I found I should
be incapable of seeing any thing else with
pleasure or advantage, till I had once gazed
upon that object.</P>
<P>When we reached the summit of the hill
which leads to the fall of the Rhine, we
alighted from the carriage, and walked
down the steep bank, whence I saw the
river rolling turbulently over its bed of
rocks, and heard the noise of the torrent, to∣wards
which we were descending, increas∣ing
as we drew near. My heart swelled
with expectation—our path, as if formed
to give the scene its full effect, concealed for
some time the river from our view; till we
reached a wooden balcony, projecting on
the edge of the water, and whence, just
<PB N="60" REF="75"/>
sheltered from the torrent, it bursts in all
its overwhelming wonders on the astonish∣ed
sight. That stupendous cataract, rush∣ing
with wild impetuosity over those
broken, unequal rocks, which, lifting up
their sharp points amidst its sea of foam,
disturb its headlong course, multiply its
falls, and make the afflicted waters roar—
that cadence of tumultuous sound, which
had never till now struck upon my ear—
those long feathery surges, giving the ele∣ment
a new aspect—that spray rising into
clouds of vapour, and reflecting the pris∣matic
colours, while it disperses itself over
the hills—never, never can I forget the sen∣sations
of that moment! when with a sort
of annihilation of self, with every past im∣pression
erased from my memory, I felt as
if my heart were bursting with emotions
too strong to be sustained.—Oh, majestic
torrent! which hast conveyed a new image
of nature to my soul, the moments I have
<PB N="61" REF="76"/>
passed in contemplating thy sublimity will
form an epocha in my short span!—thy
course is coeval with time, and thou wilt
rush down thy rocky walls when this bo∣som,
which throbs with admiration of thy
greatness, shall beat no longer!</P>
<P>What an effort does it require to leave,
after a transient glimpse, a scene on which,
while we meditate, we can take no account
of time! its narrow limits seem too confined
for the expanded spirit; such objects appear
to belong to immortality; they call the
musing mind from all its little cares and
vanities, to higher destinies and regions,
more congenial than this world to the feel∣ings
they excite. I had been often sum∣moned
by my fellow-travellers to depart,
had often repeated “but one moment
more,” and many “moments more” had
elapsed, before I could resolve to tear my∣self
from the balcony.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="77"/>
We crossed the river, below the fall, in a
boat, and had leisure to observe the sur∣rounding
scenery. The cataract, however,
had for me a sort of fascinating power,
which, if I withdrew my eyes for a mo∣ment,
again fastened them on its impetuous
waters. In the back-ground of the torrent
a bare mountain lifts its head encircled with
its blue vapours; on the right rises a steep
cliff, of an enormous height, covered with
wood, and upon its summit stands the
Castle of Lauffen, with its frowning towers,
and encircled with its crannied wall; on
the left, human industry has seized upon a
slender thread of this mighty torrent in its
fall, and made it subservient to the purposes
of commerce. Founderies, mills, and
wheels, are erected on the edge of the
river, and a portion of the vast bason into
which the cataract falls is confined by a
dyke, which preserves the warehouses and
the neighbouring huts from its inundations.
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
Sheltered within this little nook, and ac∣customed
to the neighbourhood of the tor∣rent,
the boatman unloads his merchandize,
and the artisan pursues his toil, regardless
of the falling river, and inattentive to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
thundering sounds which seem calculated to
suspend all human activity in solemn and
awful astonishment; while the imagina∣tion
of the spectator is struck with the com∣parative
littleness of fleeting man, busy
with his trivial occupations, contrasted with
the view of nature in all her vast, eternal,
uncontrolable grandeur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cox estimates the height of the cataract of the Rhine at only fifty feet; Mons. Ramond, his ele∣gant French translator, adds the following note to this observation:—“ The quantity of water, which varies according to the season, has some influence upon the height, and a considerable effect upon the aspects of this fall. Those who have seen it at the period when the snows dissolve, will admit that description to be exact which Mr. Cox thinks exaggerated, and only true of remote times. I have been assured that the height of the cataract, in these circumstances, is not less than eighty feet. A stranger can scarcely, with∣out temerity, judge from his simple observation, and if he does so, he will be sure to be below the truth. I have ascertained, and Mr. Cox himself makes the same remark, that it requires the eye of a Swiss to judge of certain dimensions, which, exceeding all we have before seen, find no model of proportion in the mind. Those who have travelled for the first time in Switzerland, have often found, to their great surprise, that instead of exaggerating the heights and the dis∣tances, they have diminished them one-half, or two-thirds, till long habit taught them to expand their ideas, by furnishing them with fit objects of compa∣rison.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="79"/>
We walked over the celebrated wooden
bridge at Schaffhausen, of which the bold
and simple construction is considered as an
extraordinary effort of genius in the archi∣tect.
Being altogether unqualified to judge
of, or to describe its merit, I shall only ob∣serve,
that nature seems to have given the
Swiss, together with their rapid rivers, and
<PB N="65" REF="80"/>
their torrent streams, an extraordinary ge∣nius
for erecting bridges, of such daring
design, hung upon the cliff, and suspended
over the gulph, that we are not surprised
to find superstition has sometimes attributed
them to supernatural agency.</P>
<P>Part of our company being furnished
only with French passports, we left Schaff∣hausen
and returned to Zuric, without hav∣ing
visited the Lake of Constance, or its
renowned and ancient city, which, at that
period, was peopled by multitudes who
had left France without passports.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lavater.—Fall of Infidelity, and Triumph of the Religion
of our Fathers.—Fashionable Devotees.—La Harpe.
—Lectures on Religion at Idalia.—Desertion of the
Proselytes.—Theophilanthropism.</HEAD>
<P>WE staid long enough at Zuric to visit
its first literary ornament Lavater. It be∣ing
known that he is willing to receive
strangers, no traveller of any lettered curio∣sity
passes through the town, without pay∣ing
him the homage of a visit.</P>
<P>He received us in his library, which was
hung thick with portraits and engravings,
of which he has a considerable collection,
forming a complete study of the ever vary∣ing
expression of the human face divine.
Some very wise men, who admit of no
scope to that faculty of the mind called
imagination, and are for ever bringing
<PB N="67" REF="86"/>
every theory to the square, and the com∣pass,
consider his system of physiognomy as
the fantastic vision of an heated brain; but
though it may be difficult, it is surely inge∣nious
and interesting to attempt reducing to
rules a science, which seems to be founded
in nature. It is surely curious to analyse
what it is so easy to feel, the charm of that
expression, which is the emanation of mo∣ral
qualities; that undefinable grace which
is not beauty, but something more; with∣out
which its enchantments lose their power
of fascination, and which can shed an ani∣mated
glow, a spark of divinity over the
features of deformity:
<Q><L>“Mind, mind alone, bear witness earth, and heaven,</L>
<L>The living fountain in itself contains</L>
<L>Of beauteous and sublime.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Lavater is a venerable looking old man,
with a sharp long face, high features, and
a wrinkled brow: he is tall, thin, and
<PB N="68" REF="87"/>
interesting in his figure; when serious he
has a look of melancholy, almost of in∣quietude;
but when he smiles, his coun∣tenance
becomes lighted up with an ex∣pression
of sweetness and intelligence.</P>
<P>There is a simple eloquence in his con∣versation,
an effusion of the heart extreme∣ly
attractive: he speaks French with some
difficulty, and whenever he is at a loss for
an expression has recourse to German, which
I in vain begged a Swiss gentleman, who
was of our party, to translate for me: he
told me that for the most part the German
words Lavater employed were compound-epithets
of his own framing, which had pe∣culiar
energy as he used them, but which
would be quite vapid and spiritless in trans∣lation.</P>
<P>The great rule of moral conduct, Lava∣ter
said, in his opinion, was, next to God, to
<PB N="69" REF="88"/>
respect time. Time, he considered as the most
valuable of human treasures, and any waste
of it as in the highest degree immoral. He
rises every morning at the hour of five; and
though it would be agreeable to him to
breakfast immediately after rising, makes it
an invariable rule to earn that repast by
some previous labour; so that if by acci∣dent
the rest of the day is spent to no use∣ful
purpose, some portion of it may at
least be secured beyond the interruptions of
chance.</P>
<P>Lavater gave us a most pleasing account
of morals in Zuric. He had been a
preacher of the gospel, he said, in that town
thirty years; and so incapable were the
citizens of any species of corruption, that
he should have rendered himself ridiculous
had he ever during that long period preach∣ed
a sermon against it, since it was a
vice unknown. “At what a distance,”
<PB N="70" REF="89"/>
thought I, “am I arrived from London
and Paris.”</P>
<P>When we took our leave of Lavater, he
begged we would write our names and
place of abode in a book, which he appro∣priates
to the use of inscribing the long list
of his foreign visitors. An hour after my
return from his house he came to pay me a
visit, which I was taught to consider as an
unusual compliment, since it is his general
rule not to return the visits of strangers.
Religion was the theme of his discourse,
and he talked of its pleasures, its consola∣tions,
and its hopes, with a solemn sort of
enthusiastic fervor, which shewed how
much his heart was interested in the sub∣ject,
and how warmly his sensibility was
awake to devotional feelings. Although
his zeal was not without knowledge, yet it
was somewhat difficult to discover what was
his system of belief: whether he was of
<PB N="71" REF="90"/>
Paul or Apollos, a follower of Calvin ac∣cording
to the established creed of the Swiss
church, or whether he was not in some sort
the framer of a new doctrine himself.</P>
<P>One of my fellow-travellers, who was
anxious to wrest from the venerable pastor
his confession of faith, brought in review
before him the various opinions of the fa∣thers,
orthodox and heretic; from Justin
Martyr and Origin, down to the Bishop of
St. David's and Dr. Priestley. But La∣vater
did not appear to have made polemics
his study; he seemed to think right and
wrong, in historical fact, of far less im∣portance
than right and wrong in religious
sentiment; and above all, in human action.
There was more of feeling than of logic in
his conclusions; and he appeared to have
taken less pains to examine religion, than
to apply its precepts to the regulation of
those frailties and passions of the human
<PB N="72" REF="91"/>
heart, the traces of which, hidden fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
others, he had marked with such admira∣ble
accuracy in the character and expression
of outward forms. For myself, I own the
solemn, meek, affectionate expression of
Lavater's pious sentiments, were peculiarly
soothing to my feelings, after having been
so long stunned with the cavils of French
philosophers, or rather the impertinent
comments of their disciples, who are so
proud of their scepticism, that they are for
ever obtruding it in conversation. The
number of those disciples is augmented
since the revolution, which has spread far
and wide the writings of Rousseau and
Voltaire; and every Frenchman, after hav∣ing
read those authors, though he may nei∣ther
have taste enough to admire the charms
of their genius, or virtue to feel the phi∣lanthropy
of their sentiments, has, at least,
acquired sufficient knowledge to assume the
appellation of philosopher, and prove his
<PB N="73" REF="92"/>
claim to that title by enlisting himself under
the banner of infidelity, without knowing
the use of his arms.</P>
<P>This irreverence for religion, however,
which Mr. Burke considered as one of the
primary causes of the French Revolution,
is not, as heretofore, the ton amongst per∣sons
of former rank and fashion; infidelity
has been in disgrace with that class, ever
since it was profaned by the vulgar Jacobin
touch; and the only distinguished trophies
that system can now boast, are a few Anti-Newtonian
flights with respect to final
causes, from astronomic infidels. The
aristocracy were no sooner convinced that
the Catholic establishment, and above all,
the non-juring priests were their best auxi∣liaries,
than all the elegant women of Paris
became immediately devotées, and nothing
was heard of in fashionable saloons but
professions of attachment and respect <HI>“pour
<PB N="74" REF="93"/>
la religion de nos peres;</HI>” by which it was
well understood that “more was meant
than met the ear,” and that these sentiments
included the government, as well as the
creed of their fathers.</P>
<P>The great director of the consciences of
these fair converts, drest <HI>à la Psyche,</HI> was
Mons. de la Harpe, a literary man of con∣siderable
infidel reputation under the old
regime; the disciple and friend of Vol∣taire,
d'Alembert, Diderot, and other emi∣nent
encyclypodists, and in some sort a
leader of the sect after their decease, or, ac∣cording
to their own creed, after their an∣nihilation.
The Gamaliel of Mons. La
Harpe, was Madame C—T—; it
was at her feet, in the gloom of a prison,
during the terrific tyranny of the Jacobins,
that this philosopher was brought to the
knowledge and belief of Christianity. I
have before observed, that the noblest ex∣amples
<PB N="75" REF="94"/>
of fortitude and resignation under
sufferings were, during revolutionary go∣vernment,
displayed by women. It was,
no doubt, in the calmness and imperturba∣bility
of Madame C—T—'s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mind,
under the certain expectation of the scaffold,
that Mons. La Harpe was first led to ad∣mire
the effects of a persuasion, which her
eloquence and his own conviction made
him afterwards adopt; and of which he
became, in defiance of all his former opi∣nions,
the zealous and fashionable advo∣cate.</P>
<P>The cruel persecution which the Catholic
religion had sustained from the intolerant
Jacobins, had produced the usual effect of
persecution, that of rekindling the pious
zeal of a great portion of the people of
France. They returned to the religion of
their fathers, not from the same motives as
those which influenced the fine ladies and
<PB N="76" REF="95"/>
gentlemen of Paris, because it was con∣nected
with regal government; but because,
wearied with revolutionary calamities, they
stood in need of the soothing consolations
of devotion; and the churches became
crouded places of resort.</P>
<P>It was not, however, in those religious
temples that the illustrious convert to the
Catholic faith, Mons. La Harpe, became
a preacher of its doctrines. Like the hero
of Mr. Greaves's novel, Mons. La Harpe
took courage to attack the devil in his
strongest holds. Being a person of high
literary merit, he had been chosen to fill
the rhetorical chair in the Lyceum. From
that place, where, a few moons before, he
had descanted on the glorious conquests of
philosophy over superstition, and of liberty
and the rights of man over despotism and
slavery; he now poured forth the recanta∣tion
of his errors in so eloquent and touch∣ing
<PB N="77" REF="96"/>
a strain, that the neighbouring square
and streets re-echoed the long and tumul∣tuous
applauses of his fair auditory, for the
majority were always ladies.</P>
<P>The lecturer, not satisfied with the vic∣tory
gained over infidelity in this seat of
science, of which it had been so long in
possession, pursued that pernicious system
into another of its fortresses, the regions of
pleasure. Mons. La Harpe, becoming a
Catholic, was too singular an event not to
attract general notice; and as Catholicism
happened to be in fashion, the proprietors
of various places of amusement thought a
few lectures from Mons. La Harpe, on
“the religion of our fathers,” would be
no unprofitable speculation. Accordingly,
the splendid walks and fairy bowers of
Idalia, which, till then, had only re-echoed
the sounds of gaiety and pleasure, now re-sounded
with the vehement imprecations of
<PB N="78" REF="97"/>
La Harpe against that vile revolutionary
philosophy of the Rights of Man, which
had overthrown the religion of our fathers.
Mons. La Harpe continued to be the rage
in Paris, till he was succeeded by another
fashionable novelty, which happened to be
Abraham Effendi, the Turkish Ambassa∣dor.
Upon Abraham Effendi's arrival, the
fashionable and butterfly-tribe forsook once
more “the religion of their fathers,” a fa∣bric
long since undermined, and now has∣tening
to decay, after gilding for a moment
its venerable ruins with their glittering
wings.</P>
<P>But another sect was now arising, which
threatened more formidable danger to the
Roman Catholic religion than all the edicts
of Jabobin ferocity. Some serious and well∣intentioned
men, who were sensible that the
human mind without religion feels a void,
which something better must be found to
<PB N="79" REF="98"/>
fill up than the doctrine of atoms, or the
worship of reason, have become the founders
of a new system, which, setting aside the
dogmas of the Roman Catholic creed, con∣nected,
they assert, with ignorance and super∣stition,
rests only on those points in which
men of all religions are agreed, the moral
goverment of the world by the Supreme
Being, and the immortality of the soul.
This sect, distinguished by the name of
<HI>Theophilanthropists,</HI> the friends of God and
man, had formed various little societies in
Paris before their opinions were publicly
known. The simplicity of their worship,
somewhat resembling that of the Dissenters
in England, gained the attention of a few
lettered men, and the benevolence of their
doctrines became the public theme of pane∣gyric
of a member of the Directory, Lare∣velliere
Lepaux, who published a pamphlet,
the object of which was to raise these doc∣trines
into repute, by shewing the incon∣sistency
<PB N="80" REF="99"/>
of the Roman Catholic religion with
liberty. This pamphlet was answered by
Gregoire, the learned and patriotic Bishop
of Blois, with much warmth, as a calumny
against the nation: since the great majority,
he asserted, were both Catholics and Repub∣licans,
and the most democratic governments
in Europe, the smaller Cantons of Switzer∣land,
were stedfast in that belief.</P>
<P>La Revelliere Lepaux obtained the title of
high-priest of the new sect, which thus
raised into notice became the object of vari∣ous
calumnies. Some asserted it to be a
nest of terrorists, who, under the mask of
religion, and the liberty allowed to every
kind of worship, met only to frame the
means of bringing round again their late
system. Others were assured that this sect
was nothing but a band of Atheists and
Philosophers, who assembled only to pro∣pagate
principles which, disbelieving them∣selves,
<PB N="81" REF="100"/>
they intended to make instruments
of rooting out the Catholic faith.</P>
<P>Atheists and Jacobins perhaps mingle in
these congregations; but the mass appears
to be composed of people of decent charac∣ters
and manners, who, discontented with
their former creeds, have embraced this
worship till they are provided with a
better.</P>
<P>In their prayers they invoke the Supreme
Being as the author and governor of the
universe; they sing hymns of grateful ac∣knowledgment
for his bounties, and fill up
the hours of their worship with a discourse
on some moral subject, in which the obliga∣tions
to maintain liberty, and keep inviolate
the laws of the Republic are never for∣gotten.
The better-informed among the
Theophilanthropes are believers in Christa∣nity,
while others affect to talk with dis∣dain
<PB N="82" REF="101"/>
of what they call the Christian sect:
unwilling to admit, or probably ignorant
that Christianity is the sole foundation on
which rests their own scanty belief.</P>
<P>This new religious society has the sup∣port
of government in every way in which
its influence can be directed, without in∣fringing
that impartiality in religious mat∣ters
which the law requires. The modest
chambers, in which the founders of this
sect first assembled, are now changed for
the spacious churches which can scarcely
hold the crowds who resort to their meet∣ings.
The hour of the mysterious adora∣tion
of the host is no sooner passed, than the
assembly of the Theophilanthropes begin
their simple rites; and as the places of both
worships are in common, the worshippers
of both opinions often mingle together, and
learn at least the divine lesson of toleration.
How far the doctrines of this society may
<PB N="83" REF="102"/>
contribute to add to the stock of virtue in
France it is difficult to determine; but this
is certain, that the greatest revolutionary
sinners, the Jacobins, have laid aside their
worship of reason, and become the most
stedfast adherents to this creed; and sice
the belief of immortality is the most power∣ful
motive to virtue, he who is convinced
of the existence of the Supreme Being, and
offers up once a week his thanksgivings to
the Giver of every good, for his loving∣kindness
and tender mercies, will be less
inclined to sacrifice again at the altar of
Moloch, and dye his hands in human
blood.</P>
<P>The societies celebrate their worship both
on Sundays and Decadies, in order to include
the partisans of the old and new divisions of
time. Their increasing numbers have com∣pelled
them to disseminate themselves in va∣rious
quarters of the town, and they are
<PB N="84" REF="103"/>
about to apply for the equal use of all the
churches of Paris, including that of Notre
Dame. The people distinguish the two
worships by the names of the mass and
morality; and the new convert, instead of
going as formerly <HI>à la messe,</HI> tells you, if
you meet him on the way, that he is going
<HI>à la morale.</HI></P>

Ornamented Graves.—French Burials.—Solemnity of

<P>IN our route to Schaffhausen we had passed
the Haverstein, a mountain which serves
as a continuation of Mount Jura, and di∣vides
the Canton of Basil from that of So∣leure.
On the top of this mountain, which
is of difficult ascent, we found a military
post, where our permissions for travelling
in Switzerland were examined and enregis∣tered.
This pass is one of the keys of the
country, and appears, from its situation, to
be capable of being well defended against
very superior numbers; while the Canton
<PB N="86" REF="105"/>
of Basil, which lies at its base, has no na∣tural
security whatever against invasion.</P>
<P>The descent from this mountain, through
a passage cut in the rock on its summit, pre∣sents
many points of perspective which we
then thought sublime, for we had not yet
gazed on those stupendous monuments, be∣fore
which all other objects sink into little∣ness.</P>
<P>From the town of Olten, belonging to
the Canton of Soleure, and situated at the
distance of half a league from the mountain,
in a fine cultivated valley, through which
flows the Aar; we proceeded along that river
to Arau, in the Canton of Berne. A few
miles beyond we crossed a river called the
Da, at Lentzburg, a small neat town in the
same Canton; at Millingen we passed the
Reuss; this river, as well as the Limat,
falls into the Aar, which, thus enriched by
<PB N="87" REF="106"/>
the principal rivers of Switzerland, swells
to a mighty volume the waters of the
Rhine.</P>
<P>The country from Olten to Schaffhausen,
though full of those beautiful landscapes
with which Switzerland abounds, presents
few scenes except the noble views over the
Lake of Zuric, which leave lasting traces
on the memory.</P>
<P>On our return from Zuric we crossed a
chain of hills on our left, and descended into
the rich vale of Bremgarten. Instead of
repassing the Haverstein, we directed our
course along the foot of Mount Jura, to
meet the road that leads from Soleure over
this ridge of mountains, which continues
to separate the two Cantons. At Balstal, a
little village situated at the foot of those
mountains, we went to see a cataract, of
which we had heard a magnificent descrip∣tion.
<PB N="88" REF="107"/>
The rocky channel was bold and ro∣mantic,
but the heat had dried up its wa∣ters.
Our path lay through the church∣yard
of the village, and we were particu∣larly
struck with the pious homage paid to
the memory of the dead, not only in the
gilded tomb-stones and painted crosses,
which were stuck thick over the ground;
but in the humble affection which had
given the grave itself an air of animation,
by planting the pink, the violet, and other
sweet-scented herbs, on the green mounds,
beneath which reposed the mouldering dust.
Instead of the murky atmosphere, and re∣pulsive
gloom of a receptacle of the dead,
the church-yard, placed amidst wooded
rocks and pastoral hills, and emitting the
sweet sragrance of newly-springing flowers,
and the fresh garlands which were hung
around the tombs, excited pleasing images
of hope to the mind, and led to soothing
meditation. I recollected the wish of Os∣sian,
<PB N="89" REF="108"/>
“O, lay me, ye that see the light,
near some rock of my hills; let the thick
bazels be around, let the rustling oak be
near. Green be the place of my rest; and
let the sound of the distant torrent be
heard.”</P>
<P>How remote from these tender cares of
mourning humanity is the treatment observ∣ed
in France towards the dead; and which
might seem a relapse to barbarism, if we did
not find, even among the most savage na∣tions,
some civilized marks of human re∣verence,
some decent ceremonial paid to the
relicks of our mortal nature! It might, per∣haps,
be necessary to restrain the display of
that vanity which, before the revolution,
decked its mockery of woe with idle pomp
and pageantry; but stern indeed must be
the reformer, who admires that cold-blood∣ed
philosophy which consigns those to
whom we were bound by the holiest ties of
<PB N="90" REF="109"/>
humanity, or the dearest feelings of the
heart, without regret, to the unhallowed
proces-verbal of a municipal officer, who
strides away with indecent haste before the
yet unstiffened corpse, and, like death, the
common leveller, hurls it into the common
pit, among undistinguished heaps of dead.</P>
<P>During the epocha of the worship of rea∣son,
a tacit approbation of this annihilation
of vulgar prejudices might have been wrung
from fear; since at that time, amongst the
well-fed monsters in the republic, death,
and the grave—
<Q><L>—“Upturn'd</L>
<L>Their nostrils wide into the murky air,</L>
<L>Sagacious of their quarry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton</NOTE>—”</L></Q>
and revelled on the dead, as their pioneers,
terror, and Jacobin-government, rioted on
the living.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="110"/>
But when public or private safety are no
longer endangered by the indulgence of
tender affections, even though equality
should be sometimes wounded by the little
distinctions which they might love to con∣fer
on the mouldering clay, it is surely
tyranny over the most amiable weaknesses
of our nature to tear thus rudely from the
fond survivor that form which, a few
hours before, was folded to the heart in the
last agonies of separation, and to which it
still clings with the bitterness of unavailing
regret!</P>
<P>We returned to Basil on a Sunday morn∣ing,
time enough to join a throng of wor∣shippers
at the French Protestant church,
whose respectful demeanour and devout
attention formed a singular and soothing
contrast to the coarse impiety we had so
lately witnessed at Paris; where we had seen
<PB N="92" REF="111"/>
altars overthrown, the surplice and the
mitre transformed into caparisons for horses;
had heard the commissaries of revolutionary
committees boast, that at their Bacchanalian
orgies their gross libations had been poured
from sacramental cups, and had observed
that no political blasphemy was so striking
to those reformers as the slightest mark of
respect for religion. The practice of shut∣ting
up the gates of the Swiss towns, dur∣ing
divine service, to prevent the rolling of
carriages, though attended with inconveni∣ence
to travellers, is so far pleasing, as it
consecrates one day in seven to relaxation
and repose. The strict observance of this
day of rest in Switzerland forms an agree∣able
contrast to the busy, as well as dis∣sipated
manner in which both Sunday and
Decadi are passed in France; which festi∣vals,
being ever at war with each other,
neither are celebrated with respect.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="112"/>
Not only are the stated returns of inter∣vals
of rest necessary for man, but the voice
of mercy calls aloud on the French legisla∣ture
to interpose between the restless acti∣vity
or avarice of the master, and the beast.
Nothing is more pleasing than to observe
throughout Switzerland the care, and even
tenderness which is shewn to the animal
creation; while in France they feel the pri∣mary
curse of labour inflicted in all its se∣verity.
Sunday and Decadi, alike the load∣ed
horse drags on his heavy burden; alike
the merciless lash for ever resounds along
the streets, and those whose nerves are not
steeled against every pain but their own,
are denied the relief of knowing, that an
appointed respite from toil is the privilege
of that miserable race.</P>
<P>Among the moral diversities of Switzer∣land,
none are marked with more precision
<PB N="94" REF="113"/>
than their territorial belief. In a ride of
two or three hours from the Canton of
Basil into that of Soleure, and over a branch
of the Canton of Berne into that of Lucerne,
we found ourselves alternately on Catholic
and Protestant ground. In whatever cause
originated these whimsical boundaries of
their geographical religion, which hereto∣fore
lighted up so often the flames of civil
dissention, it is soothing to observe, that
since the beginning of the present century,
the Swiss have discovered that the sword is
not the most persuasive weapon of religious
controversy. Two religions, that of the
Roman church, and the assemblage of dog∣mas
of the sixteenth century, called the
Helvetic confession, are the exclusive reli∣gions
of the Helvetic confederacy. Hume
has somewhere observed, that the hatred of
Polemics is most inveterate, where the points
in dispute are the least remote; it is not
<PB N="95" REF="114"/>
therefore surprising that civil dissentions in
Switzerland should have been carried to
such excess, since the faith, for which both
parties contended, is conceived in the same
spirit of intolerance, and buried in the same
labyrinth of incomprehensibility.</P>

<P>OF the forty thousand inhabitants, which
compose the population of the city and
Canton of Basil, the burghers forming the
fifth part of that number alone enjoy, or
fancy they enjoy the rights of equality.
The people of Basil are divided into two
distinct classes, that of the burghers, consist∣ing
of eight thousand persons, and that of
the other inhabitants; which last class in∣creases
<PB N="97" REF="116"/>
in the same proportion that the first
diminishes from year to year, and now
amounts to about seven thousand persons.
This latter class is in a state of complete de∣gradation,
excluded from all political rights,
can exercise no trade, and the individuals of
which it is formed are considered merely
as strangers, to whom the privilege is grant∣ed
of living in the town, placēd, for the
most part, under the immediate responsibi∣lity
of the manufacturer or artizan by whom
they are employed, and who is bound to
take such measures respecting them, as shall
prevent their becoming burdensome to the
state.</P>
<P>When persons of this class are born in
Basil, when even their parents have been
natives of the city for several successive ge∣nerations,
they acquire not one further pre∣rogative
from these circumstances; and the
admission of a few of these individuals to
<PB N="98" REF="117"/>
the rights of burghers, is always attended
with so many obstacles, that the instances
in which it takes place are extremely rare.
Few of this class attain considerable wealth,
yet the increase of their number, their per∣severance
in remaining in this humiliating
condition, while they are forced to support
the load of heavy taxes from which the
burghers are exempted, and receive no other
benefit from the government than personal
protection and safety, prove, however,
that they at least enjoy some advantages of
which they were not before possessed, and
give a strong idea of the wretchedness of
their situation in the countries which they
have forsaken.</P>
<P>What is remarkable enough in this cele∣brated
land of freedom, where the the poet
tells us, that
<Q><L>“Even the peasant boasts his rights to scan,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate himself as man.”</L></Q>
<PB N="99" REF="118"/>
All the peasantry in the Canton of Basil,
with only the exception of the little town
of Liestal, which enjoys a few municipal
privileges, are literally serfs, and annexed
to the soil. In the feudal times, these peo∣ple,
who belonged to their respective chiefs,
were successively sold, with the possessions
on which they were found, to the city of
Basil, then an imperial city. These Gothic
prerogatives, however, have long since been
prudently thrown into the back-ground,
and are now less likely than ever to be re∣vived,
at the distance of half a mile from
the shouts of equality, fraternity, and the
rights of man.</P>
<P>A stranger who travels through France
into Switzerland, cannot fail to observe the
different appearance of the habitations of
the peasantry of each country. The abject
condition of this class in France, previous
<PB N="100" REF="119"/>
to the revolution, was one of the most pro∣minent
features of the wretchedness of the
government; and sufficient time has not yet
clapsed to change the external marks of
misery. The commanding chateau still
frowns in gloomy magnificence, over the
mud-walled hut, though the inhabitants are
now possessed of equal rights. In Switzer∣land,
the peasant's habitation, however
poor, has the air of comfort and convenience.
Every wooden cottage has its garden, or
orchard, and the limpid brook running be∣fore
the door of the thatch, gives the whole
an air of freshness.</P>
<P>The peasants of the Canton of Basil are,
like the generality of peasants in Switzer∣land,
well clothed and fed, have the liberty,
which is no small prerogative, of judging,
in the first instance, their own disputes,
without the intervention of the Bailiff,
<PB N="101" REF="120"/>
whose treasury is too often swelled by the
fines of contention; and have also the pri∣vilege
of bearing arms.</P>
<P>Their neighbours, the French peasantry,
need no longer look upon these advantages
with the glance of envy or the sigh of re∣gret;
since for the French husbandman,
above every other class of Frenchmen, the
revolution hitherto has been made. While
the nobility, the clergy, the pensioners of
the state, have been ruined; while com∣merce,
for a while annihilated amidst the
overwhelming shock of political convul∣sions,
is now but slowly awakening once
more to life, the husbandman, emancipated
from every feudal calim, exonerated from
every species of personal servitude, disbur∣thened
of every tax, and relieved from every
oppression, has, above all others, had cause
to bless the dawn of liberty. Even the
horrible tempest of revolutionary terror
<PB N="102" REF="121"/>
passed harmless over his head; and while
the palace was devastated, and the chateau
levelled to the ground, his cottage stood
erect; amidst the violation of all other pos∣sessions,
his property, with the exception
of a few revolutionary requisitions, was re∣spected;
and, amidst hosts of executioners,
his person was safe. During the long
course and vast depreciation of paper-money,
the farmer paid, with the labour of a week,
the rents of the year; and was enabled, not
only to augment his stock, but often be∣came
himself a purchaser of land. Suffi∣ciently
an egotist to take every possible ad∣vantage
of circumstances, at the same time
that he disbursed his rent in paper, he sold
his corn only for money; while the starv∣ing
proprietor of land, was compelled, like
Belvidera, to “part with the antient orna∣ments
of massy plate,” to buy the wheat
which grew on his own ground for the
support of himself and his family. With the
<PB N="103" REF="122"/>
return of money the landlord, indeed, has
been rescued from poverty, by receiving his
revenue in solid coin; which the farmers,
immensely enriched by the reign of paper,
are well enabled to pay. They at present
form a bold, independent class of yeomanry,
a class till now unknown in this country,
and their once bare-legged wives and
daughters proudly display their white
stockings, rich-laced caps, shining pen∣dants,
and golden crosses, which, in the
country, still continue to be worn as a badge
of their faith, as well as a decoration of
their persons.</P>
<P>The population of the Canton of Basil
being very far beyond the proportion of its
extent of territory, great numbers are em∣ployed
in manufactures, particularly that of
cottons and ribbons, which are brought to
great perfection. Over the manufacturers
of these articles, the governors find it ad∣vantageous
<PB N="104" REF="123"/>
to manifest some portion of their
right of sovereignty; for in vain the father
of a family may cultivate his field of flax,
and prepare it for use; in vain his wife may
spin, his infants turn the wheel which
winds the thread, and he himself weave the
woof; the web when woven is not at his
disposition—he has no right over the pro∣duce
of his labour, no power to dispose of
what he has acquired by the sweat of his
brow and the toil of his hands; he must
carry his little stock to the capital of his
Canton, and there, and only there, is per∣mitted
to sell it; while the burgher of the
town, who is the purchaser, has previously
arranged the price at which it shall be sold.
A more vexatious law than this is, I be∣lieve,
scarcely to be sound in the whole code
of despotism.</P>
<P>If such be the paternal care of the politi∣cal
fathers of Basil over their children, it
<PB N="105" REF="124"/>
would be superfluous to expect from them
any marks of tender regard for those, who,
as strangers, have no claim to their protec∣tion.
But against none of the family of
the human race is this republican choler so
vehemently displayed, as against that miser∣able
victim of Christian wrath and con∣tempt,
the follower of the religion of
Moses. In despite of his imputed crimes,
a dreadful legacy inherited from his ances∣try,
the Jew, who has found in many
countries of Europe an asylum, in France
has found a country. This despised wan∣derer
can here cling fast to his home, and
raised from that state of humiliation into
which our Anti-Christian barbarity had
plunged him, for ages the object of its se∣verest
persecution, the Jew, a citizen, be∣comes
the proprietor of the soil, enriches
himself in peace by the gains of his indus∣dustry,
can lift his front in the senate, and
become the highest officer in the state.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="125"/>
Divine spirit of toleration! not of that
toleration that throws the humiliating arm
of protection over the creature of its forbear∣ance,
and, proud of its privileges, grants as
a boon what ought to be conceded as a right;
but of that toleration which regards as
children of the same original, and entitled
to an equal share of his beneficence, the
professors of the primitive faith of the Pa∣triarchs,
the followers of the dogmas of the
Catholic creed, and of Calvin, and the be∣lievers
in the simple truths of the gospel.</P>
<P>Against this innovating principle the Ba∣silians
for two centuries past have struggled
with zealous uniformity. Previous to the
French revolution, the epocha of Jewish
liberty, Gregoire, distinguished no less for
a strict adherence to his own faith, than for
that large benevolence of soul which hails a
brother in every religious creed, became the
avowed advocate of this persecuted race,
<PB N="107" REF="126"/>
and prepared their way to liberty, by incul∣cating
on the minds of their persecutors
the heavenly lesson of toleration. Even the
pale-faced crescent, catching some particles
of its divine light, has at lenght reflected its
favoring beams on the celebration of Chris∣tian
worship. But in the Protestant Canton
of Basil no Catholic rites are allowed, and a
Jew is an object of unceasing abhorrence.
Not only is the residence of these elder bre∣thren
of their faith forbidden by the burgh∣ers
of Basil; but without the express per∣mission
of the supreme magistrate, or ha∣zarding
the payment of a heavy fine, durst
any Israelitish wanderer rest within the
walls for one night his wearied head. No
act of commerce can pass between a Jew
and a Basilian, however equal their talents
in the arts of trade, without the intervention
of a public officer in aid of the latter; and so
careful is the protecting hand of govern∣ment
in favor of the burgher, that no
<PB N="108" REF="127"/>
contract with a Jew, unless ratified by
the burgo-master, is binding on the be∣liever.</P>
<P>It has been invidiously stated, that the
jealousy of trade has suggested these prudent
precautions; but the superior attainments
of the inhabitants of Basil, in the science of
commerce, renders such a precaution un∣necessary.
No person of discernment will
put in competition the fine commercial in∣telligence
of a burgher of Basil, with the
rude cunning of the miserable outcast of his
proscription; and this zeal against Judaism
must be resolved into the abhorrence with
which Basil Christians consider this impious
sect, delivered over to final reprobation. The
Jew, who does not understand the niceties
of Basil belief, might indeed reasonably ex∣pect
to find in a free state the privileges al∣lowed
to his brethren in despotic countries
by Catholic inquisitors: he may perhaps be
<PB N="109" REF="128"/>
allowed to murmur at the detail of in∣hospitality
with which he is treated at
Basil, and exclaim with the Jew of Ve∣nice:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Government of the Canton of Basil.—Mode of Election of
the Members of the Council, and of the Professors of the
University.—Ancient and Modern State of Litera∣ture.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we observe in the Canton of
Basil, which is composed of forty thousand
inhabitants, that more than thirty thousand
of that number enjoy no privileges, it will
be some relief to find that liberty has taken
refuge among the remainder. The actual
number of burghers does not exceed seven
thousand, and of these no more than three
hundred wield the sceptre of government
for life, under the name of members of the
great and little councils.</P>
<P>Although, when vacancies take place, the
members of these councils are chosen from
<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
amongst the burghers, they are not chosen
by them. The care of the nomination falls
to the lot of the members of the councils
themselves, who, knowing from experience
the fatigues and difficulties of governing,
are supposed to be better informed than the
mass of the burghers, what heads are best
organized for the duties of that important
station.</P>
<P>The right of citizenship is never ac∣quired,
as in France, by residence: the am∣bitious
wight who aspires to this distinc∣tion,
after obtaining the permission of the
grand council, must purchase the privilege
with a large sum of money, unless he be∣comes
enamoured of some fair daughter of
a burgher, when he is allowed to make a
composition for his freedom by paying one
half in money, and as a compromise for
the other, taxing himself with a wife. But
though admitted to be a burgher, the privi∣lege
<PB N="112" REF="131"/>
of being eligible to any office of the
government belongs only to his posterity of
the third or fourth generation. Criminal
conviction suspends all civil rights, and the
crime of bankruptcy at Basil, ranked by
other governments under the class of mis∣fortunes,
attaints with the same degradation
even the highest officers of the state.</P>
<P>Lest thirty-nine thousand seven hundred
inhabitants of the Canton of Basil should
murmur at being governed by three hundred
self-elected individuals, means have been
taken to lessen the appearance of this usur∣pation
in the eyes of the people. With this
view the elections of the vacant seats of go∣vernment
are made by lot: when a vacancy
happens six candidates are chosen by the
great council, after which those candidates
draw lots for the place.</P>
<P>This mode of election may perhaps be
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
pardonable with respect to the members of
the great and little council. Perhaps no
eminent talents are requisite to fill those
stations, or to perform the parts of burgo∣masters
or tribunes; and indeed the opinion,
that it requires little art to govern, appears to
be spreading so generally throughout Europe,
that in many parts of it men seem disposed
to govern themselves.</P>
<P>But what is not to be forgiven is having
adopted this mode of drawing lots to fill up
the vacant seats at the university. Those
superior endowments of mind, which give
the right of presiding over the researches of
science, are in all ages and nations dispensed
with parsimony, and at Basil are probably
for the most part dispensed in vain: since
no doubt chance often bids dullness mount
the throne, while black-balled genius
“wastes its talents on the desart air.” Of
this there is a remarkable instance on the
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
records of the university, where those orna∣ments
of their country, the illustrious ma∣thematicians,
the Bernouillis, who would
have been the ornaments of any country,
after frequent rejection by black-balls, ob∣tained
at length the chairs of professors of
rhetoric and botany.</P>
<P>It may indeed be now alledged in justi∣fication
of this practice, that there is little to
teach since there are few to learn: the col∣leges
are without pupils, and the professor∣ships
are merely sinecures. Yet Basil was
once the centre of science, the chosen resi∣dence
of the great Erasmus, and possessed
an university, the professors of which were
composed of the most enlightened men of
the age, and on which the Eulers, and the
Boehmens conferred celebrity: and we are
told by Mr. Cox, that he found shop∣keepers
in this city reading Virgil, Horace,
and Plutarch; from which he was, no
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
doubt, well authorized to draw his conclu∣sion,
that there is no country in the world
where the people are so happy. But what∣ever
were the Halcyon days of taste and
learning at the period of Mr. Cox's visit,
it is a melancholy fact, that this literary
spirit has entirely evaporated since his de∣parture.
These lettered triumphs, the
“tales of other times,” are buried in ten∣fold
gloom: the Swiss themselves admit,
that Basil is the Boeotia of their country,
and Horace, Virgil, and Plutarch, are now
in general disrepute, not only among the
shopkeepers, but even among the wholesale
dealers of this once classic city.</P>
<P>Science is in few countries the certain
road to wealth, but the modern rulers of
Basil seem to have determined, that it shall
there be the sure path to poverty. Since,
while those citizens, whose knowledge ex∣tends
only to the rules of arthmetic, who
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
read nothing but their ledgers, and under∣stand
nothing but the course of exchange,
enjoy all the lavish luxuries of affluence,
the ill-fated wight whom the love of learn∣ing,
or the impulse of genius leads to the
professorship of a college, is forced to con∣tent
himself with that narrow stipend,
which, instead of keeping pace with the
increase of wealth, remains, amidst its flow∣ing
tide, an antique monument of the few
and simple wants of early times.</P>
<P>But to have annexed poverty to letters
appears not to have been thought sufficient
by that portion of the praise-worthy Helve∣tic
body, which presides over the destinies
of Basil. They have stamped a mark of
disgrace on the brow of science; and whilst
the taylor, the fisherman, the shoe-maker,
the boatman, all men but the man of let∣ters,
can assert their claims as burghers to
the public honors and dignities of the state,
<Q><PB N="117" REF="136"/>
“And saving ignorance enthrones by law;”</Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
the professors of the university are excluded.
Genius is treated like other strangers in the
city of Basil, and refused all participation
in the rights and immunities of its privi∣leged
burghers.</P>
<P>Even here, however, we find a chosen
few have not bowed the knee to Baal, and
who cultivate letters with the ardor of ele∣gant
minds; but their number is not suf∣ficient
to save their city from reproach, and
those accomplished exceptions only serve to
establish the general rule, as a solitary
flower on a desart heath reminds the tra∣veller
of the surrounding barrenness. While
I recall the few men of superior intellec∣tual
endowments, which Basil still can
boast, the image of my venerable friend,
Colonel Frey, naturally presents itself to
my mind: that respectable veteran in litera∣ture
<PB N="118" REF="137"/>
as well as arms, who unites with those
polished manners, acquired during fifty years
of military service in France, all the more
solid attainments of learning and science: he
possesses a fine library, one of the few cabi∣nets
of natural history at Basil, which, rich
in petrifications, marbles, and minerals, de∣serves
the attention of strangers, and passes
the evening of an active life in the placid
satisfactions of study. I enjoyed the ad∣vantage
of his protection during my stay at
Basil, and have a sufficiently discerning sense
of merit to know how to appreciate his
friendship. Colonel Frey's second son is
married to M. du F—, the romantic
history of whose parents is sketched in my
first volume of letters on France.</P>
<P>Mr. Le Grand, member of the great
council, an ardent and enlightened friend of
the French Republic, had taught his in∣fants
to lisp the cherished sounds of liberty,
<PB N="119" REF="138"/>
and chaunt its favorite airs with such fond
enthusiasm, that his house seemed to me a
chapel worthy of William Tell.</P>
<P>Although the number of enlightened
men in Basil is very inconsiderable, it is easy
to perceive, that in the general resurrec∣tion
to liberty, which Switzerland is about
to experience, this Canton, to borrow an
expression from Gibbon, will, from its
moral and geographical position, be the
first to cast away the shroud.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Curiosities of Basil.—Arsenal.—Cathedral.—Public Li∣brary.
—Dance of Death.—Departure from Basil.—
Sempack.—Reflections on the Love of Freedom.</HEAD>
<P>DURING our stay at Basil, we visited,
like other travellers, the arsenal, the orna∣ments
of which are composed of shields,
swords, and breast-plates, which, from their
enormous size, would crush ten modern ci∣tizens
of Basil, and reminded us of Nes∣tor's
speech, where he exclaims—
<Q><L>“A god-like race of heroes once I knew,</L>
<L>Such as no more these aged eyes shall view.”</L>
<BIBL>POPE'S HOMER.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We then proceeded to the cathedral, a
fine piece of architecture, but disfigured
without by a coating of red paint: what is
most interesting within is the tomb of
<PB N="121" REF="140"/>
Erasmus, a frugal tablet of common mar∣ble
stuck against the wall.</P>
<P>At the public library we were shewn,
with extreme politeness, the various and
valuable curiosities it contains; such as the
collection of manuscripts which is highly
precious, manuscript letters of Erasmus,
the original sketches of most of the fine
pictures of Holbein, the Passion painted in
the first style of this master, and other ad∣mirable
pieces worthy of the public library
and museum of Paris.</P>
<P>We saw M. Mechel's fine collection of
engravings, and we also visited the hideous
series of figures called the Dance of Death,
and painted by Kleber, a pupil of Holbein.
After seeing these, and some other less im∣portant
curiosities, we took leave of our
friends at Basil, in order to enjoy a nearer
view of those sublime objects, which we
<PB N="122" REF="141"/>
had hitherto seen only at a distance, lifting
their hoary heads to the heavens.</P>
<P>We crossed again the Haverstein, and
passed through Olten to Arbourg, a small
town on the river Aar, overlooked by a
castle, which is the northern bastile of the
Canton of Berne for state-offenders. From
Zoffingen, a pleasant and populous town
about two leagues from Arbourg, we pro∣ceeded
through a delicious country of gent∣ly
swelling hills, and finely watered mea∣dows,
to Sursee, a town of the Canton of
Lucerne. Half a mile from Sursee is the
Lake of Sempach, along which we travelled
nearly the whole of its length, and which
takes its name from a little town on the
eastern side, where was fought that ever
memorable battle which gave liberty to
Switzerland. With equal contempt of their
numbers and discipline, Duke Leopold, at
the head of a formidable phalanx, and at∣tended
<PB N="123" REF="142"/>
by the first nobility of the empire,
attacked the little army, consisting of thir∣teen
hundred men of the four confederate
Cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Un∣derwalden.
The Swiss had in vain attempt∣ed
to pierce the enemy's ranks, and the fate
of war hung doubtful; when Arnold de
Wilkenreid, devoting himself, like Decius,
to certain death, after recommending his
wife and children to the care of his country,
opened the way to victory, by throwing
himself on the lances of the Austrians, who,
seized with astonishment at this effort of
desperate valour, yielded to the impetuous
torrent for which Wilkenreid had freed a
passage, and fled; leaving Leopold on the
field with the flower of his army.</P>
<P>On the spot where this memorable vic∣tory
was gained, is built a chapel in com∣memoration
of the event; in which are
seen the portraits of the Duke of Austria
<PB N="124" REF="143"/>
and his chief nobility who perished with
him, and whose bodies were transported for
burial to some distant abbey, while the ashes
of the Swiss heroes yet consecrate the field
of honor where they so generously poured
out their lives. Several of these chapels,
the monuments of the piety and valour of
the early Swiss, are to be seen in this coun∣try.
As festivals and games were instituted
among the Greeks to keep alive the heroi∣cal
deeds of their ancestors, so the Swiss,
on the anniversary of great events, were
accustomed to go in solemn procession to
those chapels, and offer up their public
thansgivings.</P>
<P>This practice, which has been long dis∣continued
in other parts of Switzerland, is
still observed at this chapel. Every year,
on the ninth of July, a solemn mass is per∣formed,
and an oration suitable to the oc∣casion
is pronounced; the Republic of
<PB N="125" REF="144"/>
Lucerne defrays the expence, and some of
the magistates attend the service. The in∣habitants
of this district are not altogether
unconscious that they live in the neighbour∣hood
of heroes. The person who undertook
to be our Cicerone, was a smart-looking
hostess of a village inn.—“There,” said
she, “on the brow of that hill we stood,
dressed in carters' frocks, and the Austrians
thought we were a fresh army of soldiers.”
By <HI>we</HI> were meant the women of that day,
who, according to local tradition, for it does
not appear to be recorded in any history,
made use of this stratagem to multiply the
appearance of the confederated forces. Had
our Cicerone lived at that period, there is
no doubt, from the energy with which she
imputed to herself the feats of her ancestry,
that she would have been foremost in the
van of this <HI>corps de reserve.</HI></P>
<P>The remembrance of the illustrious acts
<PB N="126" REF="145"/>
of their ancestors is cherished by enslaved
nations with fond enthusiasm, and even de∣generated
nations attempt to hide their own
disgrace beneath the glories of their history.
When the French armies lately entered
Greece, the Patriarch, at the head of the
procession, met the conquerors with the
books of Homer. Though bowed beneath
the yoke of European tyranny,
<Q>“Th' unconquerable mind, and freedom's holy
flame,”</Q>
Is felt not only by
<Q><L>—“the savage youth</L>
<L>Beneath the odorous shade</L>
<L>Of Chili's boundless forests laid,”</L>
<BIBL>GRAY.</BIBL></Q>
but throughout the immense tract of that
rich and violated continent, where the Pe∣ruvian,
stealing from the glance of his
tyrant, hies to the native circle, joins in
the melancholy dance, and laments, with
<PB N="127" REF="146"/>
tears, the departed splendour of his coun∣try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of the existence of this fond enthusiasm I have lately heard much from some well informed French∣men, who had been long resident in that part of the globe, and who, under the false pretence of their being engaged in a conspiracy in favor of liberty, were thrown into the dungeons of Mexico, where they remained loaded with irons till after the conclusion of the peace between France and Spain, when they were ordered to leave the country. The Viceroy of Mexico, bro∣ther of the Prince de Paix, as a reward for his vigilant persecution of those French citizens, was decorated by his Court with the title of Reconquistador, and a se∣cond Cortez.</P>
<P>When in my poem on Peru, one of my earliest pro∣ductions, I fondly poured forth the wish that the na∣tives of that once happy country might regain their freedom, it seemed rather the illusive dream of fancy than founded on any solid basis of hope. That revo∣lution had not yet taken place, which appears destined to break the fetters of mankind in whatever region they are found, and which transforms what was once the vision of poetic enthusiasm into the sober certainty of expectation.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="147"/>
The human mind, frozen under the su∣perstition
of ages, unfolds itself to the ge∣nial
gale of freedom, passing even for a
moment over its stiffened faculties. The
transient revolt of Rhenzi was regarded by
Petrarch as the return of the golden age of
Rome; and the subject of the Italian Pon∣tiff
views, at the present day, the light of
freedom reflected from the rocks of the Cis∣alpine
Republic on the capitol, and hails
the happy augur.</P>
<P>Festivals in favour of liberty, had they
been habitual in Switzerland, would pro∣bably
have been forbidden by the policy of
the times. It would have been dangerous
to have kindled fuel near so mighty a con∣flagration.
But where the spirit of liberty
is to be preserved or excited, as in France,
perhaps no means is more effectual than that
of the periodical commemoration of great
<PB N="129" REF="148"/>
events. What Frenchman can hear, un∣moved,
the names of Fleurus, Lodi, Kell,
Arcole, and the Tagliamento?—but were the
long list of French victories to be comme∣morated,
the calendar itself would scarcely
contain the catalogue.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lucerne.—Voyage down the Lake of Lucerne.—Ger∣sau.
—Schweitz.—Brunnen.—Tell's Chapel.—Lake
of Uri.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER leaving the lake of Sempach, we
ascended the hills that lead to Lucerne.
From their summits, we were first present∣ed
with the near view of that grand and
majestic scenery, which we had hitherto
only beheld at a distance. Mount Pilate,
lifted high above the rolling clouds its
shagged head; of which, at intervals, we
caught a glance, while its dark green sides
contrasted finely with the varied vegetation
around us.</P>
<P>The approach to Lucerne is beautifully
picturesque. About half a league from the
<PB N="131" REF="150"/>
town we crossed the Emmen, near the spot
where it mingles its streams with the Reuss,
which pours its swelling and limpid wa∣ters
of a grassy hue from the lake. Lu∣cerne
is divided by this river, and the lake,
into unequal portions, but the communica∣tion
is rendered easy and agreeable by means
of four bridges; one of which of ordinary
construction, serves for the passage of car∣riages,
while the other three are calculated
only for foot passengers. These bridges,
one of which is six or seven hundred feet in
length, and another from three to four
hundred feet, present delightful views over
the lake to the mountains, and serve as
walks to the inhabitants, who are sheltered
from the sun and rain, by a roof supported
at every ten steps by pillars of wood: be∣tween
those pillars pannels are fixed, paint∣ed
on both sides, which represent in
some places the most celebrated events of
their national history, and in others scrip∣ture-subjects,
<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
and fanciful figures of poetry
and romance, such as winged dragons,
griffins, devils, and centaurs:
<Q>“Monsters and Hydras, and Chimaeras dire.”</Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></P>
<P>Some of these paintings are well exe∣cuted;
but are unfavorably placed on ac∣count
of the shadow of the roof. One of
our Lucerne friends pointed out a piece
which represented an execution, the instru∣ment
of death resembles the machine, of
which such abhorred use was made in
France during the reign of terror, and robs
of the merit of the invention a member of
the first national assembly, M. Gullotin,
whose name it bears.</P>
<P>As we wished to cross the Alps without
delay, we remained but a short time at Lu∣cerne,
intending on our return to take a
more detailed view of this enchanting
<PB N="133" REF="152"/>
country. Before our departure we made a
visit to General Pfyffer, whose plan in relief
of the little Cantons is an interesting monu∣ment
of topographical genius and laborious
constancy. The General related to us with
his usual affability, all the perils and diffi∣culties
he had encountered in the formation
of this admirable mimick-creation of silver
torrents, mossy forests, tin houses, and glass
lakes.</P>
<P>We embarked our horses, and departing
from Lucerne at an early hour of a fine
cloudless morning, began our voyage down
the lake to Altorf. The hills rising from
the shores near the town, which are but of
little elevation, are covered for the most
part with country-houses and gardens;
and here the inhabitants, instead of warring
with nature by strait lines and trimmed
trees, had aided her loveliness by their taste
in disposition and forbearance in ornament.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="153"/>
At the distance of three miles from Lu∣cerne
the lake opens on both sides, stretch∣ing
away on the left to the Canton of Zug,
and on the right to that of Underwalden.
On the one side Mount Pilate, rifing ab∣rupt
from the waters, displayed its sublime
and uncovered head: on the other the lofty
but more humble Rigi poured down its nu∣merous
torrents, illuminated by the sun∣beams,
like silvered lines in swift succes∣sion,
at which we gazed with delight, while,
we were passing along tremendous rocks,
whose vast shadows fell black upon the
clear azure of the waters. Before us the
mountains swelled majestically, clothed with
a luxuriancy of trees; but as we proceeded
the rocks narrowed, and seemed to forbid
our progress.</P>
<P>At this point the breadth of the lake is
very inconsiderable; but having passed these
straights a turn of the rock discovers ano∣ther
<PB N="135" REF="154"/>
ample sea, whence we discerned the
lofty hills of Uri on our right; and to
the west a considerable portion of the re∣fluent
lake that washed the rocks of Under∣walden.</P>
<P>On the left, beneath the inaccessible and
encircling craggs of the Rigi, is situated the
independent state of Gersau, where we dis∣embarked.</P>
<P>This Republic comprehending its re∣gency,
single, double, and triple councils,
treasurer, grand sautier, secretaries, judges,
ministers, officers, naval and military force,
and the governed of all descriptions, con∣tains
from nine hundred to a thousand souls.
Cavalry makes no part of the strength of
this territory, since the lofty ramparts of
rock, by which it is divided from the main
land, are inaccessible to horses. It possesses,
however, a numerous fleet of boats, which
<PB N="136" REF="155"/>
rode at anchor before the port, and pre∣vented
for some time the entrance of our
vessel. Having on our landing sauntered
to one part of the state to take a survey of
its edifices, our ears were assailed by a tu∣multuous
noise, which proceeded from the
tuneful throats of a multitude assembled in
the church at the other end of the repub∣lic,
celebrating the praises of Saints Zeno
and Bridget.</P>
<P>The chief import of this republic is raw
silk, which is manufactured for Basil and
Zurich; its exports are principally fruit and
fish, in the capture of which the fleet is em∣ployed
which we saw moored in the har∣bour.</P>
<P>Gersau allied itself to the Democratic
Cantons in the beginning of the fourteenth
century, and adopted their form of govern∣ment.
The history of the wars and treaties,
<PB N="137" REF="156"/>
troubles, domestic and foreign, of this
small republic, though it make no consi∣derable
figure in the history of the world,
fills many a page in the records of the Lake
of the four Cantons.</P>
<P>The earliest warlike atchievement of Ger∣sau
appears to have been directed against
Lucerne. Discontented with a decision
given by the Canton of Zug, as arbitrator,
in favour of the Lucernois, the Gersovians,
like Homer's heroes, began hostilities by
stealing the cattle of their neighbours of
Wigis,
<Q><L>“When from their fury fled the trembling swains,</L>
<L>And theirs was all the plunder of the plains;</L>
<L>Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,</L>
<L>As many goats, as many lowing kine.”</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE'S ILIAD, Book xi.</BIBL>
Reprisals were made, and the contest might
perhaps have been as bloody as that of the
<PB N="138" REF="157"/>
Pylian Sage with the Epian powers, had
not the allied Cantons interfered, and im∣posed
a heavy retribution on the Gerso∣vians.</P>
<P>This republic, which is said to be the
least in Switzerland, and perhaps in Eu∣rope,
and is scarcely known beyond the ken
of the craggs, and the lake that surround
it, far from furnishing us with new themes
of the happiness and security of such hum∣ble
states, bore many marks of the vices
and defects of more extensive governments.
A few handsome mansions, surrounded by
wretched cabins, and infested by beggars,
afforded no presumptive evidence of an
equal distribution of power or wealth. The
republic of Gersau, however, has some∣times
had the honour of holding the ba∣lance
of Swiss power, and is said at the
famous battle of Cappel, in which Zuin∣glius
fell, to have turned the scale in favour
<PB N="139" REF="158"/>
of the cause for which they fought, and to
have been one of the principal instruments
in the preservation of the Catholic Religion
in Switzerland.</P>
<P>After having visited whatever was wor∣thy
of notice at Gersau, we reimbarked and
proceeded on our voyage. The Canton of
Schweitz lay in the direction we were sail∣ing,
presenting us with a fine perspective
of woody and romantic country, rising from
sloping hills, on the side of which the town
of Schweitz is built, into lofty forests of
pines, which are crowned by two towering
mountains with sharp pointed peaks. The
town of Brunnen is the port of this Can∣ton,
and the road from thence to Schweitz,
about two miles distance, is an agreeable
walk, which is usually taken by every tra∣veller
who sails up this lake; since few re∣fuse
to turn a little out of their way in order
<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
to tread upon the spot which gives its name
to Switzerland.</P>
<P>The shores of the Lake of the four Can∣tons
have witnessed most of the great actions
that have been performed in Switzerland;
as those of the Mediterranean have been the
scenes of whatever has most dignified the his∣tory
of the world. At Brunen, in 1315,
the treaty was confirmed between the coun∣tries
of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
which asserted their independence. At
Grutlen, a village at the foot of the Seelis∣burg,
on the opposite side of the lake, was
held the confederacy where the generous
design was planned by the three heroes for
the deliverance of their country. The
chapel of William Tell, as we advanced,
presents itself on the right, perched among
the rocks, in commemoration of his escape
from the bailiff Geisler, by leaping from
<PB N="141" REF="160"/>
the boat in the midst of a tempest raised by
subterraneous winds, which often render
this navigation dangerous.</P>
<P>No place could surely be found more
correspondent to a great and generous pur∣pose,
more worthy of an heroical and sub∣lime
action, than the august and solemn
scenery around us. The Lake which we
had traversed nearly from west to east,
turns direct from the point opposite Brunen
to the south, and is said to be in this part
six or seven hundred feet deep. This
branch is called the Lake of Uri. Near its
entrance insulated pointed rocks of singular
form and construction rise boldly from the
water. Having passed those precipices, we
entered into a gulph, of which the boun∣daries
were awfully terrific. On each side
of the profound abyss, the dark lowering
rocks rose sometimes abrupt, and barren,
sometimes presenting tufts of pine and
<PB N="142" REF="161"/>
beech between its shaggy masses, and occa∣sionally
beyond these savage limits of the
lake, the eye caught a glimpse of moun∣tains
in the lofty perspective, clothed mid∣way
with forests, and rising into peaks of
alternate pasturage and craggs.</P>
<P>Beneath their inaccessible ramparts, whose
enormous height gives an appearance of
narrowness to the lake, we sailed, gazing
with that kind of rapt astonishment which
fears to disturb, or be disturbed by the mu∣tual
communication of thought. The ap∣proach
of night spread new forms of sha∣dowy
greatness over the scene. We had
loitered many hours on our passage, forget∣ting
that the last part of our voyage was
the most perilous. But the unruffled still∣ness
of the water, the delicious serenity of
the evening, and the long reflected rays of
the moon from the whitened summits of the
opposite mountains, of which we sometimes
<PB N="143" REF="162"/>
caught a glimpse, dissipated every idea of
danger. The only sounds that broke the
awful silence were the gentle motion of the
oars of our wearied boatmen, and the toll∣ing
of the distant bell from Altorf, borne
down the lake, and
<Q>“Swinging slow with sullen roar.”</Q>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></P>
<P>We had passed through all the soft grada∣tions
of twilight, and had enjoyed the
brownest horrors of evening in all their
deepening gloom, before the moon had
scaled the lofty summits which concealed
her from our view. At length she burst
upon us in her fullest radiancy, illumining
the dusky sides of the cragged rocks, and
the dark foliage of the piny woods; bur∣nishing
with her silver rays the smooth
and limpid waters; shooting her shadowy
beams along the lake to the distant perspec∣tive
<PB N="144" REF="163"/>
of the mountains we had left behind;
and lighting up the whole majestic scenery
with glorious and chastened lustre.</P>
<P>We reached almost with regret Fluellen,
the port whither we were bound, and
mounting our horses proceeded to Altorf,
which lies at the distance of two miles.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING our impa∣tience
to climb St. Gothard, it would have
been unpardonable not to have passed a few
hours in contemplating the most remarkable
objects at Altorf, the capital of Uri, and
the laurelled cradle of the Helvetic confede∣ration.</P>
<P>Two hundred years since, the tree yet
stood erect in the market-place, to which
the son of William Tell was bound. On
this sacred spot is built a kind of painted
tower, and at some little distance, where it
is said the father stood, when he shot the
apple from his son's head, a public foun∣tain
<PB N="146" REF="165"/>
is erected, called Tell's fountain; on
which is placed the frowning statue of this
generous deliverer of his country. There
must surely be some defect in the heart,
which feels no enthusiastic glow, while we
tread over the spots where those heroes have
trod, who have struggled for the liber∣ties
of mankind, or bled for their rights.
Yet one of that everlasting race of doubters,
who wage an eternal war with all those
sublime traditions, those heroical sacrifices,
and those deeds of greatness, which it is
delightful to believe, has destroyed with a
touch of his sterile pen all the bright im∣ages
with which imagination peoples this
scene of marvels, by asserting in a treatise,
published thirty years since at Berne, that
all the romantic feats of William Tell were
in far remoter times performed by Toko, a
Dane, against Harold, a king of Denmark,
in the tenth century. This cold inquirer
was probably not aware of all the disagree∣able
<PB N="147" REF="166"/>
sensations, which would be felt by en∣thusiastic
travellers, who had been worship∣ping
the statue of Tell, when they were in∣formed
that their homage should be ad∣dressed
to Toko. It is indeed pretended that
there is an unfortunate co-incidence of cir∣cumstances
in the narration of the Danish
historian, with respect to the shooting at
the apple, and the speech made to the
tyrant. The sovereign council of Berne,
however, ordered the book to be burnt, and
I feel much inclined to excuse this coercive
measure of those puissant Lords, since I
cannot but share their resentment. Tell is
in England, as well as Switzerland, the
hero of our infancy; the marvellous tale of
the apple is one of our earliest lessons, and
who can endure to give to Toko those tro∣phies,
which he has been taught from child∣hood
were the rights of Tell! The only
circumstance in the Saxon's favor, or rather
that of the author who cites him; is the mo∣desty
<PB N="148" REF="167"/>
with which he delivers his doubts:
had he lived in our days, he would, per∣haps,
have allegorized William Tell and
Toko himself, with as little ceremony as
M. Dupuis, and his less learned pupils in
infidelity, have allegorized the most sacred
characters of antiquity. The fantastic spe∣culations
of these later Pyrrhonists have in∣deed
been treated with more severity than
the fable of the Historian. The political in∣fallibility
of a sovereign council may per∣haps
be arraigned, and Rousseau suggests,
“that burning is not answering;” but who
shall raise up the whimsical tribe of Alle∣gorists,
crushed beneath the logical wit of
the philosophical believer?</P>
<P>After leaving Altorf, we journeyed along
a valley of three leagues, through which the
Reuss flows with the ordinary rapidity of a
Swiss river.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="168"/>
About six miles from Altorf, we passed
by a chapel in a meadow; the façade of
which was decorated with a highly co∣loured
painting, representing a stag-hunt,
which appeared to be a singular ornament
for a place of religious worship. We found
upon inquiry, that this meadow was one
of the places of general assembly, that
it was called the Jag-Matt, or hunting mea∣dow;
and that on the day of St. Mark the
whole country march to this chapel in pro∣cession.</P>
<P>The rocks, clothed at intervals with trees
of various sorts rose high and steep on each
side of the valley, which wore a fertile and
smiling appearance till we came to the vil∣lage
of Stag; above which the Alps first
lift their majestic heads. Here we began to
ascend that mass of mountains, which is ra∣ther
the base than the mountain itself of St.
Gothard. The road suddenly becomes so
<PB N="150" REF="169"/>
steep, that it required at first some address
to keep a seat on horseback. The river,
which glided gently through the valley on
its expanded bed, being now hemmed in by
rocks, begins to struggle for its passage at a
profound depth. The pine clad-hills rose
on each side to our farthest ken, down
which torrent streams were rushing, and
crossed our way to mingle themselves with
the Reuss, which continually presented new
scenes of wonder. The mountains seemed
to close upon us as we advanced, sometimes
but just space enough was left to admit the
passage of the river foaming through the
rocks, which seem obstinately to oppose its
passage. The road lay for a considerable
length on the left side of the precipices, from
which we beheld the struggles of the wa∣ters,
and the tremendous succession of cas∣cades
which they formed. An abrupt pre∣cipice,
forbidding the continuance of the
road on this side, a bridge of hardy construc∣tion
<PB N="151" REF="170"/>
led to the opposite mountain, which is
ascended, till meeting with a similar ob∣struction,
we crossed the stream again to
the left.</P>
<P>On one of these bridges, we halted to
gaze upon the scene around us, and the
yawning gulph below. The depth is so
tremendous, that the first emotion, in look∣ing
over the bridge is that of terror, lest the
side should fall away and plunge you into
the dark abyss; and it requires some reflec∣tion
to calm the painful turbulence of sur∣prize,
and leave the mind the full indulg∣ence
of the sensations of solemn enthusiastic
delight, which swell the heart, while we
contemplate such stupendous objects.</P>
<P>The name of this bridge, in the language
of the country, is the Priest's leap; whether
the holy man leapt over the gulph, or into
it, is not remembered, but it is difficult to
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
hear the story on the spot without an invo∣luntary
shudder, or fancy yourself in per∣fect
security.</P>
<Q><L>“The very place puts toys of desperation,</L>
<L>Without more motive into every brain,</L>
<L>That looks so many fathoms to the gulph,</L>
<L>And hears it roar beneath.”</L></Q>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>The road up to the village of Wassen is
highly romantic: here the industry of men
has tamed some of those wild torrents, of
which such numbers run idly to waste; and
sawing mills and other machinery owe
their impulse to those swiftly descending
volumes. In this village we halted to re∣pose
from our fatigues, and began to feel
some of the mountain breezes which con∣trasted
very agreeably with the concentrated
heat that had subdued us in the valley be∣neath.
It was Sunday, the day was fine,
and the village was crouded with the moun∣taineers
<PB N="153" REF="172"/>
who had come in to keep the festi∣val,
and practise, as they do every week in
some village of the Canton, the art of
shooting at a mark, which, independent of
the amusement, is a duty imposed on every
citizen, who, under the inspection of a ma∣gistrate,
is obliged in the course of the year
to fire a certain number of rounds, that he
may keep his arms in order, and not forget
the means of defending his country in case
of invasion. We could yet see no traces of
snow, except in the numerous torrents which
rolled down the enormous mountains, the
streams of which were considerably in∣creased
from a cause that in less mountain∣ous
countries would have produced an oppo∣site
effect, the excessive heat and dryness of
the weather, which melted the snows of the
Glaciers.</P>
<P>The views around Wassen are astonish∣ing
for their variety as well as beauty. You
<PB N="154" REF="173"/>
perceive, however, after passing the village,
that you are advancing into a country where
man is obliged to be continually at war
with nature. On one side the mountain
was stripped of its piny clothing to some
extent, discovering, instead of dark green
foliage, a bare rocky and gravelly waste, in∣terspersed
with wrecks of trees. This, we
were told, was the ravage of an avalanche.
When whole forests of majestic height are
swept away with irresistible fury, what
means of defence can human force oppose
to such mighty destruction? Men, how∣ever,
live tranquilly amidst the danger, and
build their houses in such positions, and af∣ter
such a construction, that the enemy,
even if he chances to take the direction of
their habitations, may pass over them un∣hurt.</P>
<P>Rocks, for the most part, are made their
allies against these invasions from the snowy
<PB N="155" REF="174"/>
mountains; but even rocks, coeval with
time, often yield to the terrible devastation.
As we advanced, the country, which had
hitherto presented scenes of blended grace
and majesty, began to assume an aspect of
savage wildness and terror. A few habita∣tions
and green spots amidst these deserts,
gave still some relief to the piece; but after
passing the little village of Gestinen, and
the torrent of the Meyen which crosses the
road to increase the waters of the Reuss, all
is tremendous and awful. Here no pines
wave their lofty heads, no mountain shrubs
display their simple flowrets, nor does even
a blade of weed betray the possibility of ex∣istence
to any thing that breathes.</P>
<P>It was now the most luxuriant part of
summer; we had left the glowing harvests
beneath ripe for the sickle, and the fruits at
two or three leagues distance hung in la∣vish
clusters upon the bough; but in this
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
region it not only was winter, but a winter
that seemed here to have fixed its eternal
abode; for not only were there no traces of
renovation to inspire hope, but the impossi∣bility
of change was every where obdurately
marked. Immense piles of naked rock,
not less lofty than the mountains along
which we passed, rose sometimes perpendi∣cularly
above our heads, and sometimes fall∣ing
back, left between the road and their
horrid tops immense masses that seemed
shivered from their sides, forming vast fields
of rock.</P>
<P>This passage, which in summer is suffici∣ciently
terrific, becomes dangerous in win∣ter
by the frequent avalanches that rush
from those tremendous heights, and so de∣licately
are these messengers of destruction
hung on the summits, that the guides and
mule-drivers tye up the bells of their cattle
to prevent the gingling, and forbid a word
<PB N="157" REF="176"/>
to be spoken by the passengers, that the ava∣lanche,
which waits on the mountain to
overwhelm them, may not hear them ap∣proach.
Little crosses placed by the road
side where travellers have perished, are me∣lancholy
mementos of such mortal accidents,
against which, however, precautions are
taken, by firing muskets to shake the air
and precipitate the impending avalanche.
Huge fragments of rocks sometimes present
themselves as if they threatened to obstruct
the way; and we remarked one enormous
piece of beautiful granite that skirted the
road, and is called the devil's stone, which,
on account of some misunderstanding with
the people of the country, he brought down
from the mountain to destroy some of the
works he had himself formerly con∣structed.</P>
<P>If any superstition is pardonable, it is
that of the inhabitants of this mountain,
<PB N="158" REF="177"/>
and had the epic poets from Homer, down
to our sublime Milton, seen this valley of
Schellinen before they described their Tar∣tarus
or Pandemonium, they would have
caught some new images of the savage and
terrific, and their hells would have been ha∣bitations
less desirable.</P>
<P>The devil of this country, however,
cannot, in the estimation of the rude moun∣taineers,
be the same malignant mischievous
fiend which the inhabitants of plains and ci∣vilized
countries make him, since, if he has
chosen this chaos of nature for his habita∣tion,
he has not shut up his palace, like
other stately monarchs, from the vulgar eye,
but, on the contrary, has unfolded the re∣cesses
of his dwelling by opening ways,
and building bridges, which the moun∣taineers
believe none but himself could have
constructed, and by which he has certainly
“deserved well of the country.”</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="178"/>
Nothing can be imagined more bold and
daring than the road that leads through the
valley of Schellenen to the mountain of St.
Gothard; the difficulties appear almost in∣surmountable;
sometimes the road seems
so narrow between frightful precipices on
each side, that great blocks of granite are
placed on the edges as safeguards to the
passengers; and where the mountain forbids
all possibility of passage, offering an impe∣netrable
rampart by its vertical abruptness,
the path juts out from the side supported
by arches and pillars, which are built up
from some salient points of the mass be∣neath,
and seems “a ridge of pendant
rock over the vexed abyss.”</P>
<P>This road, the breadth of which differs
according to the facility of construction, is
in some places from twelve to fifteen feet
wide, and in others only ten, leaving in
general space enough for loaded mules to
<PB N="160" REF="179"/>
pass each other; it is paved the greatest
part of the way with granite, and is com∣pared,
by Mr. Raymond, to a ribband
thrown negligently over the mountains.</P>
<P>After winding for some time among
these awful scenes, of which no painting
can give an adequate description, and of
which an imagination the most pregnant in
sublime horrors could form but a very im∣perfect
idea, we came within the sound of
these cataracts of the Reuss which an∣nounced
our approach towards another ope∣ration
of Satanic power, called the Devil's
Bridge. We were more struck with the
august drapery of this supernatural work,
than with the work itself. It seemed less
marvellous than expectation had pictured it,
and we were perhaps the more disappoint∣ed,
as we remembered that “the wonder∣ous
art pontifical,” was a part of architecture
with which his infernal majesty was per∣fectly
<PB N="161" REF="180"/>
well acquainted; and the rocks of
the valley of Schellenen were certainly as
solid foundations for bridge building as
“the aggregated soil solid, or slimy,”
which was collected amidst the waste of
chaos, and crouded drove “from each side
shoaling towards the mouth of hell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paradise Lost, Book x.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>On this spot we loitered for some time to
contemplate the stupendous and terrific sce∣nery.
The mountainous rocks lifted their
heads abrupt, and appeared to fix the limits
of our progress at this point, unless we
could climb the mighty torrent which was
struggling impetuously for passage under
our feet, after precipitating its afflicted wa∣ters
with tremendous roar in successive cas∣cades
over the disjointed rocks, and filling
the atmosphere with its foam.</P>
<P>Separating ourselves with reluctance
<PB N="162" REF="181"/>
from these objects of overwhelming great∣ness,
we turned an angle of the mountain at
the end of the bridge, and proceeded along
a way of difficult ascent, which led to a
rock that seemed inflexibly to bar our pas∣sage.
A bridge fastened to this rock by
iron work, and suspended over the torrent,
was formerly the only means of passing,
but numerous accidents led the government
to seek another outlet. The rock being too
high to climb, and too weighty to remove,
the engineer took the middle way, and
bored a hole in the solid mass two hundred
feet long, and about ten or twelve feet
broad and high, through which he carried
the road, The entrance into this subterra∣neous
passage is almost dark, and the little
light that penetrates through a crevice in the
rock, serves only to make its obscurity
more visible. Filled with powerful images
of the terrible and sublime, from the enor∣mous
objects which I had been contemplat∣ing
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
for some hours past, objects, the forms
of which were new to my imagination, it
was not without a feeling of reluctance that
I plunged into this scene of night, whose
thick gloom heightened every sensation of
terror.</P>
<P>After passing through this cavern, the
view which suddenly unfolded itself ap∣peared
rather a gay illusion of the fancy
than real nature. No magical wand was
ever fabled to shift more instantaneously the
scene, or call up forms of more striking
contrast to those on which we had gazed.
On the other side of the cavern we seemed
amidst the chaos or the overthrow of nature;
on this we beheld her drest in all the love∣liness
of infancy or renovation, with every
charm of soft and tranquil beauty. The
rugged and stony interstices between the
mountain and the road were here changed
into smooth and verdant paths; the abrupt
<PB N="164" REF="183"/>
precipice and shagged rock were metamor∣phosed
into gently sloping declivities; the
barren and monotonous desert was trans∣formed
into a fertile and smiling plain. The
long resounding cataract, struggling through
the huge masses of granite, here be∣came
a calm and limpid current, gliding
over fine beds of sand with gentle mur∣murs,
as if reluctant to leave that enchant∣ing
abode.</P>
<P>Near the middle of this delicious valley,
called the Vale of Urseren, is the village of
In-der-Malt, which appeared to have been
lately built: behind it was a small forest of
pine trees, which are preserved with so
much care as a rampart against the ava∣lanches,
that the sacred wood was not held
more inviolate; and we were told, that the
profanation of the axe on this palladium
would be followed with the death of the
sacrilegious offender.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="184"/>
One of my fellow travellers observed,
that this valley, which is three miles in
length, and two in breadth, had, according
to every appearance, been originally a lake;
for which he adduced many mineralogical
reasons; and that the drying up of the lake
was occasioned by some violent fraction at
the bottom of the valley, which drained the
water off from the land, leaving it in its
present form. Every part of the valley bore
marks of high cultivation, if that term can
be applied to the culture of meadow lands,
where we saw herds of cattle grazing. One
production indeed, essentially necessary for a
country so elevated, was wanting; although
the day had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> uncommonly beautiful and
serene, and the sun shed its softest rays
where we entered this valley, yet the snows
on the higher mountains, and our feelings,
when at the close of the evening we reached
the village of the Hospital, at the opposite
side of the valley, reminded us that the
<PB N="166" REF="185"/>
most acceptable offering our host could
make us was, one of those bundles of wood
which the villagers are obliged to bring up
with great labor and expence from the
mountains beneath.</P>
<P>According to popular tradition, this val∣ley
was not always so unprovided with this
article of first necessity: the mountaineers
are persuaded that their hills were once co∣vered
with forests, but that some magician
who dwelt higher up the mountain, or in
some other place, less a paradise than their
own, not only burnt their woods, but so
bound the soil with potent spells, that it has
ever since been incapable of producing trees.
The magician could not have exhibited a
more mischievous specimen of his art to
the inhabitants of this valley. Time might
indeed have repaired the conflagration, but
what exorcism shall restore fertility to the
enchanted soil! Some writers conjecture
<PB N="167" REF="186"/>
that the wood in this valley was consumed
by accident; and that trees grew no
more on the spot, because the winds which
sweep irresistibly over the heights tear up
the young plants before they can take root,
being unsheltered by old trees. The greater
part of the vallies of Switzerland, it is ob∣served,
wear the same appearance; the soil
occasionally gives way; the trees on the
higher ground lose their footing and slide
down; those which grow beneath them
being no longer sheltered are torn up by
winds; and snow which then accumulates
without opposition on the heights, where
those forests stood, melting at the return of
spring, overwhelms the hills with torrents,
dragging away the vegetable earth, and
leaving the mountain a skeleton, unfit for
pasturage, or precipitating itself in the form
of avalanches, destroys every thing in its
course▪</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="187"/>
This valley is under the protection, or
rather subject to the Canton of Uri. It for∣merly
made part of the Empire, but the
Abbot of Disertis, in the Grisons, possessed
various seignorial rights. The house of
Austria disposed of its prefecture in the
beginning of the fourteenth century, to
Henri de L'Hospital, a gentleman of Uri,
from whom it was afterwards forcibly
transferred, as historians tell us, to Conrad
de Moos, another gentleman of the same
country. The passage through this valley
had often been the subject of contention.
At one time the inhabitants, assisted by the
Abbot, made war on their neighbours of
Uri; at another, aided by their former op∣ponents
and two other neighbouring Can∣tons,
they crossed St. Gothard to fight with
their present fellow subjects, the inha∣bitants
of the Levantine. Various other dis∣putes
having arisen between the inhabitants
and the Abbot, which always terminated in
<PB N="169" REF="188"/>
bloodshed, the people who had been indebt∣ed
to their allies of Uri, for their assistance
in the preservation of their liberties, suc∣ceeded
in the beginning of the fifteenth cen∣tury
in a negociation with the Canton, and
relieved themselves for ever of the trouble
of taking any farther care of their own
privileges, by putting them under the di∣rection
of their more powerful neighbours,
with a reserve, however, of municipal
rights, such as the election of their ma∣gistrates,
and the trial of civil and criminal
causes, subject to the revision of the Can∣ton
of Uri.</P>
<P>The valley contains two other villages,
besides these already mentioned; and they
are the highest social habitations in Europe.
The ecclesiastical affairs of the valley are
under the direction of the Bishop of Coire,
nor has the late revolution interrupted this
spiritual intercourse. Formerly the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="170" REF="189"/>
chose their priests subject to the con∣firmation
of the bishop, and the Abbot
of Disentis, but of late the administrator
in holy things is a Capuchin of the Can∣ton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Top of St. Gothard.—Airolo.</HEAD>
<P>WE passed the night at the village of Hos∣pital,
and the next morning pursued our
journey, beginning from hence to ascend
what is properly the mountain of St. Go∣thard.
The scene no longer exhibited the
savage horrors of the chaos we had traversed
the preceding day; the road was neither
extremely rapid or dangerous; every where
we beheld vegetation, and the mountain
myrtle, the white hellebore, and other
shrubs, indigenous to high regions, were in
their bloom. The Reuss had now sunk
into a rivulet, being no longer fed, as below,
by the numerous streams that assemble their
waters from the hills on each side Urseren;
sometimes it presented a succession of fanci∣ful
<PB N="172" REF="191"/>
cascades, across which one might leap
without apprehension, even if the foot
should slip in the enterprise. We had been
much affected during the night with cold,
and concluded that we had more to suffer
before we gained the summit; but exercise
and the enlivening sun-beams banished a
sensation so new, after having the preceding
day felt the heats of July in the valley of
Altorf.</P>
<P>We hitherto found that we had in∣dulged
a vain expectation of enjoying, from
those lofty heights, vast and picturesque
views of the countries beneath; since we
had nearly attained what is called the top of
St. Gothard, and had yet seen no object that
was more remote than the distance of two
leagues. If we looked forward, there ap∣peard
nothing but the mountain which we
had to climb, and which, having ascended,
was succeeded by another. When we looked
<PB N="173" REF="192"/>
back, the mountain we had left was the
only object which presented itself, and on
either side our view was confined by these
wooded precipices, through which, the pre∣ceding
morning, we had winded our way.
Between Urseren and the summit of St. Go∣thard,
amidst piles of rocks which seemed
to forbid all ken beyond, we were, how∣ever,
gratified with one of those bursts
through an opening to the north, which
displayed in rich succession the summits of
all the mountains we had passed, and others
at an immense distance, some gilded by sun∣shine,
and some enveloped by clouds rolling
like a troubled ocean far beneath.</P>
<P>Although the sun poured its noon-tide
rays, we perceived that we were ascending
into regions of frost, from the appearance,
or rather the absence, of vegetation. The
luxuriant pasture of the valley was succeed∣ed
by a coarse spiral grass, which now gave
<PB N="174" REF="193"/>
way to moss, or the bare rock, and a soli∣tary
and stunted shrub sometimes protrud∣ing
itself, seemed to mark, not so much
the barrenness of the soil, as the proscrip∣tion
of vegetable life.</P>
<P>We at length attained the summit of St.
Gothard, and were saluted on our arrival at
the convent by a courteous monk, who
came out to welcome us, and invite to take
refreshments. During three or four months
in the year these Capuchins spend their
time agreeably enough, and probably there
is no spot half so far out of the reach of the
habitable globe, where so much variety of
amusement is to be found. Every succes∣sive
guest has much to inquire or impart,
and here above the world these hermits have
many opportunities of witnessing the whim∣sies
and follies with which it abounds.
They informed us, that the day before our
arrival a numerous retinue of horses, oxen,
<PB N="175" REF="194"/>
mules, and other cattle, had passed in the
suite of a great man, whose carriage they had
dragged, by his order, from the bottom of
the mountain, that he might have the same
of crossing St. Gothard in a vehicle with
wheels. As our countrymen are known to
be the only travelling philosophers, who
make experiments of this kind, the Monks
had no difficulty in conjecturing on the ap∣proach
of this long procession, that if it
was not the Emperor, or the burgo-master
of Berne, the two greatest personages they had
heard of, it must be an English Lord; and
they were not mistaken in their conjecture;
it proved to be an English Lord, who, for
the reasons above-mentioned, had run the
risk of breaking his neck in his mountain
gig, over precipices, which he might have
traversed without danger on horseback, or
if he could not ride, in a litter. A tragical
effect of this sort of temerity had happened
some time before to another young English
<PB N="176" REF="195"/>
nobleman, who, although repeatedly warned
by his tutors, that if he attempted to swim
down the cataracts of the Rhine, near Rhin∣felden,
he would inevitably be dashed to
pieces, made the fatal experiment, and
perished with his companion on the rocks.</P>
<P>In the winter the intercourse of these
fathers is confined chiefly to the muleteers,
who, at all seasons, traverse these mountains
in spite of snows and avalanches. Here the
poor traveller, beaten by the tempests, finds
repose and nourishment; nor do the Monks
demand, even of the wealthy passenger, any
recompence for the courtesies they bestow.
Every thing that their house affords is set
before him with cheerfulness; and he
usually returns the hospitality, by leaving
on his departure a piece of money under his
plate, in order to provide for the relief of
travellers, less fortunate than himself. But
these pious fathers chiefly maintain this be∣nevolent
<PB N="177" REF="196"/>
establishment, by begging once a
year through Switzerland for its support,
and well would monastic orders have de∣served
of mankind, and a stronger force
than the French revolution would it have
required to destroy them, had they conse∣crated
their lives and labors to works of
similar usefulness, and thus become the
benefactors instead of the burdens of so∣ciety.</P>
<P>The name of Gothard was given to this
mountain, according to historians, before
the establishment of Christianity, from the
Deity worshipped there, who was stiled, as
the name imports, the God of the summit,
or God over all: the canonization of the
mountain did not take place till the twelfth
century, when Pope Innocent the second
made the mountain a saint, and, with ro∣man
policy, chained the god of the van∣quished
faith to the car of Christian tri∣umphs.
<PB N="178" REF="197"/>
Lofty mountains are in scripture
called the Mountains of God; and although
worship in high-places has been stigmatized
as idolatry, yet surely, if the temple, which
best delights the Supreme Being, be a tem∣ple
not made with hands, that which next
to the pure and innocent heart is most
worthy of his sublimity are the summits of
those everlasting mountains, the saint but
nearest resemblance on earth of his un∣changeableness
and eternity.</P>
<P>On the top of St. Gothard, one of the
most elevated mountains of Europe, we had
once imagined the view into Italy on one
side, and over Switzerland on the other,
would reward all our toil; but this plat∣form,
so raised above the level of the earth,
is only a deep valley, when compared with
the lateral mountains, and skirting-piles of
rock that bound the view to this desart,
diversified only by the habitation of the
<PB N="179" REF="198"/>
Capuchins, and the adjoining lakes. Had
we even been able to reach any of those
rocky summits, which lie on either side,
we should have perceived only a chaos of
rocks and mountains beneath, with clouds
floating at their bases, concealing the rest
from our view, and cliffs above covered
with untrodden snows; for we were not
yet in the region of Glaciers; the eternal ice
impended far beyond; and we were told
that the mineralogists, or those who go in
search of crystal, which is found in con∣siderable
quantities in those mountains, are
the only persons who expose themselves to
the danger of climbing these tremendous
precipices. At a little distance from the
Hospice, we passed three or four lakes, each
about a quarter of a mile long, and of great
depth. These lakes are the sources of the
Reuss and the Tessino; one of those rivers
joins the Po, and flows into the Adriatic,
the other makes one of the hundred streams
<PB N="180" REF="199"/>
that swell the Rhine in its progress to the
German ocean.</P>
<P>In our rambles near the convent, we saw
the remains of a mighty avalanche, which
had so fallen as to form a magnificent
bridge over the torrent of the Tessino, the
waters having hollowed it below in strug∣gling
for a passage; but its surface had yet
resisted all the attacks of the summer sun
beams, and seemed as if pleased with its
new habitation, it had there fixed its abode
for ever. We walked over this icy bridge
to the other side of the torrent, and some
of my fellow travellers amused themselves
with a diversion not very common in the
middle of July, that of throwing snow∣balls
at each other. The temperature of this
mountain, the monk told us, was at times
various, even in the same day; but more
constant in general than in the region be∣neath.
Sometimes the Italian zephyr came
<PB N="181" REF="200"/>
over them with its genial influence, and
conveyed a transient sensation of summer:
sometimes they enjoyed clear sun-shine on
the summit, when travellers arrived from
below drenched in rain; but it appeared
from the good man's narrative, that we
must make a winter's sojourn with him to
form any adequate idea of the pelting of
the pitiless storm during six or seven
months of the year.</P>
<P>We bade adieu to this courteous monk,
promising ourselves the satisfaction of
spending a day with him on our return,
and began to descend the mountain on the
Italian side, which, though almost verti∣cally
steep, is rendered practicable by a
well paved road, formed along the side of
the mountain, and which, by its frequent
returns, brings the traveller without much
inconvenience to the base. Although the
road was good, the declivity was too great
<PB N="182" REF="201"/>
to admit of our trusting ourselves on horse∣back,
especially as our horses had not been
accustomed to travel through such moun∣tainous
countries. As we loitered down the
steep, the mules we had left behind at the
convent overtook us, and we admired the
firmness with which they trod under their
heavy burdens. Mean while a numerous
caravan coming from Italy had begun to
ascend the same precipice; and nothing
could be more picturesque than the waving
picture they presented, as they moved along
the winding path.</P>
<P>I felt some apprehension, that the meet∣ing
of such a number of mules, with their
sides distended by paniers or wine-casks, in
so narrow a road, must be fatal at least to
one division, which I expected to see tumb∣ling
down the precipice from the shock of
the other; but these animals, as if conscious
of the danger, creep to the utmost verge of
<PB N="183" REF="202"/>
the road on either side, and pass each other
in long succession without the slightest touch.</P>
<P>After descending a considerable way, we
turned to look back on the precipices we
had passed. High in air, at a remote distance,
we beheld the Tessino on the summit of the
mountain, rushing as from the sky over the
perpendicular rock. The eye, after losing
it for a moment, again catches its daring
torrent, rolling over a second precipice, now
interrupted in its fall by jutting fragments,
now struggling down a declivity of de∣tached
masses, broken into various channels.
A while it vanishes behind the angles of the
neighbouring mountains, then foreing its
passage through a narrow confine of stu∣pendous
granite beneath, dilates and throws
itself in one broad foaming sheet over the
humbler rocks. Again lost, you see
it no more, till it passes silently near
the spot whence you gaze, in soft di∣vided
<PB N="184" REF="203"/>
streams, that at length, uniting, roll
down in a long succession of regular
cascades, but little elevated one above the
other.</P>
<P>The country around, though barren from
its height, wears all the smile of vegetation;
the mountains are lofty and romantic, but
less terrific as we descend; and so little
dangerous are the precipices, that while we
were winding along the road, some of our
company amused themselves by climbing
upon the summits that skirted it, and joined
us at a bridge with various specimens of
beautiful stones which they had picked up
in their rambles. These mountains are
rich mines for mineralogists. We had long
physical disquisitions about quartz▪ mica,
and schorl, which not being perfectly intel∣ligible
to me, I continued to gaze, with un∣tired
delight, on the scene around me, while
these naturalists marched off to examine
<PB N="185" REF="204"/>
whether an adjoining mountain had most
strata of white felt-spar or green granite.
Without much knowledge, however, in the
science of stones and rocks, the traveller
cannot but observe with admiration the di∣versities
of these inanimate objects as he
passes along the road, which, in some places,
is strewed with these variegated minerals,
and becomes resplendent from the shivers
of sparkling rock that are washed down by
the streams from the summit of the moun∣tain.</P>
<P>Half way between the convent and the
first Italian village, is a bridge over the
Tessino, which is swelled by a torrent that
joins it from a neighbouring precipice,
when the river, which for some time past
had flowed tranquilly along, as if suddenly
impelled by its new companion, re-assumes
its character of wildness, and rushes in dis∣order
<PB N="186" REF="205"/>
over the rocks. Here vegetation again
struggles into life; the under shrubs lift
up their meek heads, the tusted rose of the
Alps and the mountain-myrtle waste their
sweetness on the desart scene, and dwarf
larch-trees gracefully skirt the path. The
rapid descent to the base of the mountain is
highly picturesque, the verdant valley be∣neath,
in which Airolo is placed, suddenly
opened to us strewn with villages, and,
when compared with the solitudes we had
left, presented a large and beautiful pros∣pect
of human existence; while the gloomy
grandeur of the forests of dark pines on
one side, and the view across the valley of
lesser mountains, whose last snows were dis∣solving
in the summer ray on the other,
form altogether a scene where sublimity and
grace blend in solemn harmony.</P>
<P>We entered into the Levantine valley at
<PB N="187" REF="206"/>
Airolo, which is a considerable village, or
rather a small town at the foot of St. Go∣thard,
handsomely built of stone, and the
chief entrepot or warehouse for all goods
that pass between this part of Switzerland
and Italy.</P>
<P>The adventurous spirit of commerce,
fearless of the hanging precipice, the fall∣ing
avalanche, and the yawning gulph, first
traced the daring path across this mountain,
the highest, after Mont Blanc, in Europe,
and has thus connected, by the soft ties of
civilization, two countries, between which
nature seemed to have placed an insur∣mountable
barrier. A smart girl, the
daughter of the innkeeper at Airolo, spoke
of herself as one of the mountain savages,
with an air so gracefully coquettish, and in
such pure Italian, as convinced us that she
would have been much mortified had we
affected to credit her assertion. She re∣minded
<PB N="188" REF="207"/>
me of an expression I had read in
one of Rousseau's unpublished letters to the
former Marchioness de C—, “that he
had quitted Paris to go and civilize himself
in the woods.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Valley of Levantine.—Torrents of the Tessino.—Har∣vest-home.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER leaving Airolo, we journeyed
for some hours on a fine level road, which,
from our late perpendicular travelling, we
found a very agreeable relief. The Tessino
partakes also of the gentleness of the plain,
and being joined on its entrance into the
valley by the torrents that flow from the
Glaciers on the eastern side, which separate
this country from the Haut Vallais, rolls
along an ample river, and is still fed in its
progress by tributary streams from the lofty
mountains that divide the Levantine from
the Grisons on one side, and the valleys of
Locarno and Maggia on the other. The
rushing of waters on our right as we passed
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
along, led us to penetrate through a little
grove of alder-trees to the river, where we
beheld one of these torrents paying its ho∣mage
to the Tessino in a manner singularly
graceful. Swelled by the heat on the upper
mountains beyond its usual volume, it rol∣led
impetuously down its narrow channel,
and disdaining its accustomed barrier of a
rock, by which divided into two streams
it flowed on each side into the river; now
rushing with a fuller tide of waters, it
bounded over the obstacle which it could
not displace, and mingled itself with the
Tessino at an ample distance, after describ∣ing
a lofty and beautifully feathered arch.
The upper part of this valley is chiefly de∣voted
to pasturage, but we found the pea∣sants
in some places drying their corn,
which operation is performed by suspend∣ing
the sheafs on long poles arranged hori∣zontally
above each other, and tyed to
others that are stuck in the ground. There
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
was a lightness and grace in the rustic move∣ments
of these subject Italians, which their
masters on the other side of St. Gothard
had not yet acquired. At the distance of
every quarter of a mile in the nooks of
mountains, and on the edge of precipices,
the white spire lifts its stately head, and
gives you, amidst scenes of savage wildness,
a glimpse of civilization. Secluded amidst
those alpine heights from the rest of man∣kind,
religion seems to be the sole intellec∣tual
pleasure of the inhabitants of these de∣sarts,
and the slow sounds of the frequent
bell that, amidst the clefts of the rocks,
knolls to church, is heard with a soothing
sensation by the musing traveller, flinging
its soft vibrations on the mountain echoes.</P>
<P>The closing evening brought us to the
house where a toll is received for passage,
and which we found also a very pleasant
and comfortable inn.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="211"/>
Having accompanied the Tessino since
our departure from Airolo, flowing some∣times
on our right, and sometimes on our
left, with a gentle and steady course; we
supposed that the youthful spirit with which
it had bounded over its native regions being
now sobered, it would continue to pursue,
with an even current, “the noiseless tenor
of its way.” The loud roar of many wa∣ters,
as we alighted from our horses at Da∣zio,
led us to catch the last lingering shades
of twilight, and follow those powerful
founds. Having advanced a few paces, we
perceived that the spacious valley through
which we had travelled, was abruptly closed
by stupendous perpendicular rocks, that left
no other opening than a narrow channel
with a space gained from it by human in∣dustry
to form a road between its massy
walls and the torrent. The waters which
had begun to struggle for passage above a
bridge which is thrown across the stream,
<PB N="193" REF="212"/>
were now tortured into a thousand forms.
Here a mass of rock of enormous size in
the midst of the channel raised the river at
once from its bed, pouring it impetuously
into a deep bason with tremendous roar;
there a rifted cleft, the only outlet to the
waters, increased their fury, and dashing
against the rocks with redoubled force, broke
the torrent into different currents, and filled
the atmosphere with particles of its foam.
The enormous masses of rock sometimes
lifted erect their bold and savage shapes, and
sometimes, where they had been hollowed
out to form the road, towered at an immense
height over the path and the torrent with
such threatening aspect, that I could not
pass beneath without feeling an involuntary
shudder, which was heightened by the ap∣proaching
darkness. Below the frowning
brow of the rocks, hanging groves of pine
and fir bend majestically from the cliffs,
while the graceful larch-tree decorates the
<PB N="194" REF="213"/>
banks, and the weeping birch bends far
over the stream and mingles its long
branches with the agitated waters. The
rapidity of the descent is communicated to
the river, and a succession of sweeping cas∣cades,
that rush in every imaginary form
down a channel, worn at a fearful depth
below the level of the road, leads to a
bridge which seemed hung in air over the
gulph, but of which we could only catch
an imperfect glimpse, since the last shades
of evening had now fallen on the scene, and
we trod back our steps up the winding
brink of the torrent, not without the deepest
impressions of awe softened by admiration.</P>
<P>On our return we found Dazio the resi∣dence
of mirth and gaiety. It was the
harvest-home of the master of the inn, and,
as we passed to our apartments, a chorus
met our ear that seemed to burst from some
throats more tuneful than those of peasants.
<PB N="195" REF="214"/>
With the licence allowed to travellers, we
joined the festive throng, and were not a
little amused with the manner in which this
harmonious circle was composed. The
chief of the band, and most illustrious of
the guests, were half a dozen merry Italian
priests, who, it was evident, from their
rubicund faces and sparkling looks, had
been consulting other poets than those whose
hymns were to be found in their breviaries
or mass-books. Great allowances must be
made for national customs, but the appear∣ance
of so many holy men thrilling out
amorous love-songs, and chanting baccha∣nalian
glees, although with voices harmo∣niously
tuned, and considerable force of
execution, did not a little surprise us, who
were accustomed to the gravity and reserve
of the clerical character in other countries.
We were, however, led to suppose that
these priests had not overstepped the bounds
here allowed to their profession, from the
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
delighted and respectful attention with
which the rustics around listened to their
melody; nor is it probable they would
have indulged themselves in this gay de∣meanor,
at the risk of exciting a sentiment
of irreverence towards their persons.</P>
<P>In the morning we went to take another
view of this region of nature's marvels;
day-light had diminished something of its
terror, and we surveyed its savage graces
with renewed astonishment and rapture;
the rocky fragments now glittered in the
sun, and the deep blue Italian sky spread its
lovely canopy over this scene of lavish
beauty. After passing the aërial bridge, of
which we had caught a distant glimpse
the preceding evening, we journeyed down
a steep but well-constructed road on the
edge of the Tessino, which rolled along its
narrow bed, if not with all the daring bold∣ness
of its mountain course, at least with
<PB N="197" REF="216"/>
sufficient turbulence to seize the delighted
attention, while the unwearied eye alternate∣ly
wandered from the rapid waters to the
picturesque drapery of their banks.</P>
<P>As we proceeded, the valley extended
itself in breadth, and admitted of various
kinds of cultivation, amongst which we
remarked that of the purple vines, beneath
whose broad leaves and pendant clusters,
dropping from festoons arched over our
heads as we passed along the road, we found
relief from the parching heat of the mid∣day
sun, while we looked up to the snowy
mountains which bounded this scene of
summer, with a feeling of something like
regret that we were out of the reach of
their frigid influence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Government of the Levantine Valley.</HEAD>
<P>THE Levantine Valley contains several
well-built villages, and the number of inha∣bitants,
who are all Italians, is computed at
about twelve thousand. They have in ge∣neral
a look of intelligence, and something
of mountain-independence in their manner;
but are under complete subjection to the
democracy of the Canton of Uri. The
valley is divided into eight vicinanze or dis∣tricts,
about a league each in extent. The
village of Faido, which is situated in the
midst of the Valley, is the residence of the
bailiff or governor, who is elected to this
office by the Canton of Uri, or who, rather
agreeably to the established mode of election
in these democracies, purchases the place of
his fellow citizens, who know too well the
<PB N="199" REF="218"/>
value of money not to make a good bargain
of their rights. Once in four years the in∣habitants
of this Valley behold the cortege
of their new sovereign descending from St.
Gothard, perhaps with somewhat of the
same sensations as the defenceless timid bird
views the downward flight of the pouncing
hawk, darting on his prey.</P>
<P>These rustic monarchs of Uri, in coming
to govern a people, of whose language,
manners and customs they are ignorant, do
not appear to be animated by the ambition,
which led Caesar to wish rather to be the
first man in a village than the second at
Rome. They have more solid views than
those of power; that of replenishing their
treasury, exhausted in rewards to their bro∣ther
sovereigns for their free suffrages; and
no sooner are they installed at <HI>Barataria,</HI>
than fines, exactions, and rapacities of every
kind follow in their train, and every resist∣ance
<PB N="200" REF="219"/>
to lawful authority meets with condign
punishment: as the history of each of these
subject vallies can tell, the hearts of whose
inhabitants have sometimes swelled beyond
endurance at the extortion of their harpy
governors.</P>
<P>The people of the Valley revolted against
their sovereign of Uri in the beginning of
this century, and obtained certain privileges,
which their descendants, by another revolt,
thirty or forty years since, have imprudently
forfeited. Stung into disobedience by some
act of proconsular tyranny, they took up
arms against their sovereign, and put them∣selves
into a most open and daring insurrec∣tion.
The Canton of Schweitz had, on a
former occasion, undertaken to reduce the
insurgents, and had succeeded; but the pre∣sent
rebellion bore symptoms so alarming,
that the whole of the Cantons armed to
bring the Valley to obedience. Agreeably
<PB N="201" REF="220"/>
to the maxims of most governments, that
the governors are always in the right, and
the governed in the wrong, no Canton can
interfere in any disputes between the sove∣reign
and the subjects, unless to punish the
presumption of the latter.</P>
<P>The whole Helvetic body felt the cause of
the sovereign of Uri to be their own, and
with heart and hand, with an alacrity
worthy of the cause, coalesced together to put
a decisive stop to such heretical and daner∣ous
pretensions. Had the rebels only had
to contend with their masters of Uri, it is
possible they might have shaken their au∣thority;
but when the insurgents beheld
the cohorts of every regular government in
Switzerland pouring down from the moun∣tains
in warlike array; heard the loud blast
of their trumpets, repeated by a thousand
echoes amidst their cliffs and rocks; saw
terror in the van, and annihilation in the rear;
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
they very prudently gave up a contest, which
must have ended in their utter destruc∣tion.</P>
<P>The grievances of the insurgents were re∣dressed
in the mode that might rationally be
expected: their form of government, and
all their laws were abolished, and they were
deprived of every privilege, municipal,
civil, and judicial: the use of arms, to
which every Swiss is accustomed, however
low his rank in the scale of society, was
strictly forbidden, and this sage precaution
has perpetuated their dominion, by destroy∣ing,
not only the means, but the knowledge
of resistance, since he who never handles
arms must remain ignorant of the exercise.</P>
<P>Thus the former subjects of the Levan∣tine
Valley became the unresisting slaves of
their citizen-sovereigns, and the bailiff of
Uri is now their sole administrator, law∣giver,
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
and judge. No one indeed can dis∣pute
the right of this Canton, and its allies,
to reduce these rebels to obedience, since the
charten of their servitude is clearly establish∣ed
by every document of history. In an∣cient
times they were probably, like other
mountaineers, wild, and free: but in the
twelfth century the country belonged to
bishops, then to the chapter of Milan; and
in the fourteenth century Charles the Fourth
mortgaged his imperial prefecture for a
trfling sum to Conrad or John Moos; the
same personage, who had before monopo∣lized
the prefecture of Urseren. The can∣ons
of Milan, to rid themselves of the fa∣tigues
of government, gave up their eccle∣siastical
titles to their duke; by whom they
were transmitted in the middle of the
fifteenth century, on what conditions we
know not, to the Canton of Uri, who have
ever since prudently kept possession. It
therefore clearly appears, that whether go∣verned
<PB N="204" REF="223"/>
by bishops, emperors, chapters,
canons, John Moos, dukes or democrats,
the inhabitants of the Levantine have al∣ways,
since the twelfth century, been either
subjects or serfs.</P>
<P>While the Canton of Uri takes care of
the civil concerns of the inhabitants of this
Valley, the archbishop of Milan administers
to their spiritual necessities: being judge in
all ecclesiastical disputes, with the privilege
of placing his vicar general as rector in the
seminary at Faido. Now, as the Archbishop
of Milan, under every political change, pre∣serves
the sanctity of his character, he must
no doubt continue archbishop, whether it be
as Pontiff under the Emperor of Ger∣many,
or as simple citizen of the Cisalpine
Republic. Whatever degree of fraternity,
therefore, may in future exist between this
Republic, and that of Uri, it is to be pre∣sumed,
that no flight care will be taken by
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
the latter to prevent the admission of those
principles, which have found their way into
Lombardy, since if ever these principles
should overleap their present geographical
boundary, and become points of conscience
with the subjects of the Valley, the Canton
of Uri will perhaps in vain apply to this re∣publican
archbishop to anathematize their
disobedience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Government of the Canton of Uri.—Origin of Swift
Freedom.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING traced this short sketch of the
manner in which the democratic Cantons
of Switzerland govern their subjects, it will
perhaps be proper to relate, in a few words,
the manner in which they govern them∣selves.</P>
<P>The government of the Cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, is said to be
democratic. These states were once, like
other parts of Switzerland, dependent on
the empire, and whether they were deemed
from their situation not worth the labour of
conquest, or were comprehended in that
policy which engaged the princes of the
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
empire to grant special immunities to vari∣ous
cities and districts, the inhabitants of
these wild countries enjoyed the privilege
of chusing their own magistrates, and be∣ing
governed by their own laws. This li∣berty,
however, was sometimes restrained
by the presence of an emperor's bailiff, who
resided amongst them as supreme judge in
criminal cases, and possessed other imperial
prerogatives. From some neglect of those
governors, it happened that the Cantons
were often left to their own administration,
and in one of these intervals we find, from
history, they united together in the begin∣ning
of the twelfth century, in defence of
their rights, agianst the unjust attacks of
the monks of the famous Abbey of Einsid∣len.
In vain did civil power come in aid
of ecclesiastical thunders. Neither the ban
of the empire, nor the excommunication of
the church, could shake, even in those ages
of darkness and servitude, the intrepid minds
<PB N="208" REF="227"/>
of these mountaineers; and their resistance
to the monks, the emperor, and the church,
was, after a struggle of thirty or forty
years, crowned with success. Their leagues,
offensive or defensive, with each other, could
not, however, preserve their independence.
In spite of their petitions and remonstrances,
Rodolphe, Count of Hapsbourg, was sent
in the beginning of the thirteenth century,
by the Emperor, Otho the Fourth, as im∣perial
prefect; and it appears, from the
good understanding between these Cantons,
and the successor of the Emperor, Frederick
the Second, that their chains were not worn
with an ill grace, nor was their assistance
to him in his Italian wars less chearfully
given from his being then under the sen∣tence
of papal excommunication.</P>
<P>The death of this emperor, in the middle
of the thirteenth century, having thrown
the empire into long confusion, the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="209" REF="228"/>
of these Cantons, instead of taking
advantage of the troubles, and regaining
their late short-lived independence, chose
for their captain-general, defender, or go∣vernor,
another Rodolphe, Count of Haps∣bourg.
It appears, however, that the Count
performed essential services to these Can∣tons,
and when he was named to the pur∣ple,
confirmed or bestowed on them various
privileges; but during the reign of his
ambitious son they obtained their indepen∣dence.
Albert had succeeded in bringing
several adjoining Cantons under his domi∣nion;
the town of Zurich alone resisted his
solicitations and menaces, and was defended,
in 1299, with valour and effect by the
Abbess, who was governess of the town,
and who disdained to submit to the House
of Austria. Various were the expedients
made use of by the new Emperor to engage
the inhabitants of the three Cantons to sur∣render
their privileges, and pruchase their tran∣quillity
<PB N="210" REF="229"/>
by obedience; and many were the
outrages to which they had submitted from
proconsular tyrants under the name of bai∣liffs,
who were sent amongst them with as
little ceremony, and with equal right, as
their own officers of the same description
are now deputed to regulate the concerns of
their Levantine subjects. At length the
three heroes, Slauffach, Furst, and Arnold,
formed their renowned conspiracy against
the tyrant, and on the first day of the year
1307, liberated their country, by seizing
and sending out of their territory all their
imperial governors. Their liberty was not
obtained without a struggle; the battle of
Morgarten, in which the Austrians were
routed by an inconsiderable number of
Swiss, brought on the confederation at
Brunnen, and laid the foundation for the
adhesion of the other Cantons, which suc∣cessively
joined the alliance, and the spirit
of freedom proved a more powerful barrier
<PB N="211" REF="230"/>
against the House of Austria, than even
their rocks or their mountains.</P>
<P>Each Canton, on the acquisition of its in∣dependence,
chose its own form of govern∣ment,
and the three Cantons who first freed
themselves from the yoke, made choice of
that in which the supreme power resides
essentially in the people. Each individual
who has attained the age of fourteen years,
forms a member of the sovereignty, who meet
every year on the first of May in a general
council of the nation, in order to form laws
and elect magistrates. The executive power
is entrusted to a regency, who, under this an∣nual
salutary inspection, are no doubt careful
to administer their government in such a
manner, as to meet their representatives the
ensuing year without the dread of censure.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this Canton are
esteemed, by early historians, for the po∣liteness
<PB N="212" REF="231"/>
and sincerity of their manners to∣wards
strangers; but the accounts given by
later writers are very contradictory to this
observation. Madame de Sillery, who, af∣ter
her banishment from France, resided
some months in one of these democratic
Cantons, asserts, that there is no other
country in the world where strangers are so
ill-treated. It is probable, however, that
travellers in general would meet with more
kindness than fell to the lot of Madame Sil∣lery,
who had acted too distinguished a part
in the French Revolution to have any claims
to a cordial reception in these Cantons.
We were ourselves warned to conceal care∣fully
on our journey that we had any rela∣tion
with France.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the inhabitants of the
democratic Cantons of Switzerland are un∣der
the dominion of a power far more ab∣solute
than that exercised by the privileged
<PB N="213" REF="232"/>
classes of the great Cantons. This power
is superstition, and with the aid of this
mighty engine, which molds the passions at
will, the priests have atchieved still more
than the aristocracy, and have represented
the French as apostates, that war not merely
with earth, but with heaven. No other part
of Switzerland is so unenlightened, and
consequently so hostile to the spirit of true
liberty, as these little Cantons, where de∣mocracy
and despotism march under the
same banners; for although the government
is democratic, the number of those who have
a right to a seat in the general assembly is
inconsiderable, compared with the numbers
that are excluded.</P>
<P>It is computed by a late writer, that the
population of the three Cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, with the de∣mocracies
of Zug and Glaris, amount to no
more than eighty-three thousand souls, and
<PB N="214" REF="233"/>
furnish only twenty thousand active citi∣zens;
while the countries over which they
hold sole or divided authority, contain a
population of three hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. The government, there∣fore,
though democratic with respect to
those individuals who make a part of the
sovereignty, is to the unprivileged inhabitants
of the Cantons, and to its subjects in the
bailiwicks, a confirmed hereditary aristo∣cracy;
and while in other countries the dif∣ferent
classes of society are separated from
each other by different habitudes, which
makes the evil of subordination less felt
here, where the reigning and the subject
class are the equal companions of each others
childhood, the latter must perceive with
peculiar bitterness, as they approach to
manhood, that they are destined to no share
of the boasted liberty of their country; but
that if born on the northern side of the
mountain of St. Gothard, they are sub∣jects,
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>
and if on the southern they are
slaves.</P>
<P>Avarice, as well as superstition, has
contributed to render the people of the little
Cantons hostile to the French Revolution,
and event which has interrupted the inter∣change
of those friendly courtesies which,
before that period, passed between France
and those Cantons. We cannot be much
surprised that the aristocratical Cantons of
Switzerland felt little sympathy in the esta∣blishment
of French equality; but we might
perhaps have expected more congenial sen∣timents
in governments, the existence of
which conveys a tacit approbation at least of
the sovereignty of the people, till we are
informed that France, while a monarchy,
paid a tribute to these sovereigns, which
the great Cantons had indignantly rejected.
Each male child of the three democratic
Cantons received from the day of its birth
<PB N="216" REF="235"/>
six livres annually, and the magistrates were
paid in proportion. The exchange was
fair, money for friendship. The French
republicans have broken the treaty, no
more money is paid, and no more friendship
is returned; and these democrats are as
much incensed at this violation of the com∣pact,
as if their own subjects had broken
their allegiance.</P>
<P>It requires no great penetration to dis∣cover
that the abuses which exist in these
Swiss governments will be corrected, not
so much perhaps from the struggles of the
oppressed, as from the conviction in those
who govern, how much it behoves their in∣terest
to loosen the reins of arbitrary power.
The history of every country is full of ex∣amples
how fatal to tyranny is the burst of
the heart that swells against oppression. But
without recurring to classic story, the Swiss
have only to consult their own annals, when
<PB N="217" REF="236"/>
by the valorous feats of their immortal an∣cestors,
<Q><L>“Forth from his eyric rouzed in dread</L>
<L>The ravening eagle northward fled;”</L></Q>
<BIBL>COLLINS.</BIBL>
and they will probably reflect that the age
of heroism is not past with that of chivalry;
but that those who march in the steps of an
Albert, may find in their path a Verner de
Stauffaken, or a William Tell.</P>

Lake of Lugano.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER leaving the town of Faido, we
continued our route along the valley, ever
presenting some scene of wild, solemn, ma∣jestic
beauty, over which the eye wandered
with unwearied delight; of which the pic∣ture
is indelibly graven on the imagination,
and which memory recals with soothing
rapture; but when the pen would trace
those images which glow upon the heart, it
is found unfaithful to the purpose! How
impossible to convey an adequate idea of
those varied, those colossal regions, compar∣ed
to which all other scenery is tame and
diminutive, all other objects are “flat, stale,
and unprofitable.”</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="238"/>
The beautiful little town of Giornico,
which we passed, is famous for a victory
gained by the Swiss, the latter end of the
fifteenth century, over one of the Sforzas,
duke of Milan, who, discontented with the
cession made of this valley by his ancestors,
came to reconquer the territory. Some of
the artillery taken in this engagement are
here preserved as trophies. When we came
to Pollezio, we were once more on even
ground. This is the last district of the val∣ley,
and compared with the upper part, is
of consider∣able
breadth, bearing all the pro∣ductions
of flat countries. The Tessino
increased by numerous streams, swelled by
the torrent flowing from Monte Ucello, and
no longer confined between beds of rocks
that resist its impetuosity, frequently inun∣dates
the lower part of this valley, called
Riviera, the Valley of the River, and which
is marshy, and unwholesome.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="239"/>
Further on, the waters of the Moesa,
rushing in a cataract from the mountains of
the Grisons, pour themselves into the Tes∣sino,
which now rolls on with gentle course,
a broad and ample river, till it forms the
Lago Magiore. We crossed the river of the
Grisons, and entered on the territory of
Bellinzone, and after passing through two
or three pleasant villages, hid amidst the
purple festoons, hanging from the trees ripe
for the vintage, and which had a more
picturesque appearance than the huge statues
of St. Christopher, with which they were
decorated by the piety of the inhabitants, we
came within sight of the town.</P>
<P>Bellinzone is situated near the foot of
Mount Cenere, and is also bounded by that
chain of softened hills, which ranged in wild
disorder, separate the lower valley of the
Levantine from the Swiss bailiwicks of
Maggia and Locarno. Three castles, erect∣ed
<PB N="221" REF="240"/>
on lofty heights, frown over the walls
of the city, and are successively the resi∣dence
of the bailiffs of the three democra∣tic
Cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Under∣walden,
to which Bellinzone and its de∣pendencies
are subject. We had now en∣tirely
quitted every thing that was Swiss,
except their dominion, and found a conside∣rable
change, not only in the manners, but
in the physiognomy of the people. The
women have here the fine expression of the
Madona countenance; something of which
had first struck us at Lucerne; and in the
men, we observed the robust form of the
mountaineer softened by a look of Italian
civilization. We were also reminded of
our approach to Italy, by a coarse imitation
of its taste in the plaistered piazza, the gilt
balcony, and the painted Corinthian pillars,
with which the houses were decorated. The
principal church, a building of fine con∣struction,
rich in ornaments, and a considerable
<PB N="222" REF="241"/>
number of religious edifices, give an
air of dignity to the place. After reposing
ourselves a short time at Bellinzone, we
hastened to Lugano, being desirous to see
the ceremony of the installation of the go∣vernor,
which was to take place within a
few days.</P>
<P>Our road to this town lay across Mount
Cenere, the last of that chain of mountains,
formerly called the Rhetian Alps, which
divide the Grisons from the Valtaline, and
other parts of Italy. Having travelled about
a league along the valley on the south of
Bellinzone, we began to climb the steep
ascent of Mount Cenere; and as we jour∣neyed
in the mid-day sun, should have been
much incommoded by the heat, had not the
luxuriant branches of the chesnut, which
grows to a prodigious size, and in the most
lavish profusion on this mountain, spread a
friendly shelter over our path.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="242"/>
The woods of Mount Cenere, we were
told, were the haunts of robbers, who find
a refuge from justice in their wild recesses,
and also from this mountain being a fron∣tier,
of which the legal jurisdiction is un∣certain.
Its southern promontory stretch∣ing
to the river, which joins the lakes of
Lugano and Locarno, is so infested by ser∣pents,
that at this season of the year, nei∣ther
men or cattle could approach it with∣out
danger. Half way up this mountain
forest, we were presented with a noble view
over the Lago Maggiore, the great lake, to
Locarno, and saw in the back-ground the
lofty mountains rising to Glaciers, which
separate the Vallais from Italy. After a ride
of three hours, having gained the summit,
we began to descend into a lovely pastoral
country, which opened to our view on the
opposite side. The Alps were here soft∣ened
into hills, which, when not covered
with hanging woods, wore the appearance
<PB N="224" REF="243"/>
of the most smiling cultivation, and dis∣played
in beautiful succession, those vary∣ing
groupes of picturesque objects with
which the landscape painter delights to de∣corate
his scene. Along this valley, called
the Valley of Agano, runs a small rivulet,
bearing away the last snows from the Ga∣moghera,
which lifts high in the distance
its pyramidal head, and is the central point
of the frontier mountains, stretching in va∣rious
directions from the Valteline, the Gri∣sons,
and the Italian bailiwicks: its sum∣mit,
we were told, commands a magni∣ficent
view, not only over those moun∣tainous
regions, but which, piercing beyond
them, extends as far as the city of Milan,
the cathedral of which may be seen from
that elevated point.</P>
<P>After a delicious ride through this roman∣tic
and peopled valley, we came in view of
the lake and town of Lugano, where we
<PB N="225" REF="244"/>
soon arrived, and were informed, that the
august ceremony of the installation of the
governor was to take place on the follow∣ing
day. In the mean time we found, that
the magnificent and sovereign lords of the
the Cantons, who visit on these occasions the
chief seat of ultra-montaine jurisdiction,
had taken possession of all the great apart∣ments
of the principal inn, where we had
alighted, and where they were deliberating
in full assembly on various weighty matters
of government, and unravelling knotty
points of civil and contentions concern, to
the determination of which the ordinary
knowledge of the municipal authorities of
their jurisdiction was considered as incom∣petent
or unsatisfactory. As this was not a
part of the ceremony which appeared the
most interesting, we hired a felucca in or∣der
to pass the remainder of the afternoon
on the lake, and view its enchanting scene∣ry.
The lake, which is extremely irregular,
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>
forms on that part, where the town is
situated, a fine bay, along which, to a con∣siderable
extent, elegant villas and airy pa∣villions
are profusely scattered, supported
by light arcades, and long sweeps of Corin∣thian
pillars, combining all the graceful
proportions of Grecian architecture, with
the enchanting drapery of the landscape.
In the clumsy country-seats, belonging to
no order whatever, on the other side of the
Alps, we had seen art at war with nature,
and deforming with the heavy mansion,
and the stiff part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rre, scenes, where every
natural object bore the print of uncultivated
beauty; and the only picturesque edifices
we had behold excited a gloomy emotion:
such were the thick-walled Gothic castles,
perched high on the tremendous cliffs,
frowning with sullen aspect over the sub∣ject
plain, and recalling the chearless im∣ages
of feudal times. While the polished
structures that d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>corate the lovely bay of
<PB N="227" REF="246"/>
Lugano present the fair images of Attic
taste, together with the idea of that country,
for ever dear to the lovers of the elegant
arts, where, after the long night of bar∣barism,
they once more revived to embel∣lish with
perennial flowers the path of life,
and exalt our nature, while they bless our
existence.</P>
<P>Those beautiful retreats, which adorn the
bay, belong chiefly to wealthy and noble
families of Milan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the mansions, in the neighbourhood of Lugano, is inhabited by Madame Beccaria, the daughter of the illustrious Beccaria, who inherits from her father an understanding of the first class, and unites with the graces of person, and the most charm∣ing simplicity of manners, that independence of soul, and love of rational liberty, which is the character∣istic of superior minds.</NOTE>; many of whom, ei∣ther
preserved their original inheritance, or
purchased lands in this bailiwick: and by
<PB N="228" REF="247"/>
acquiring the right of citizenship in these
privileged, though dependent districts, found
a refuge from the civil disorders of their
own country. Some of these summer man∣sions
seem to impend over the lake, while
others fall back gracefully behind luxuriant
gardens, that descend in gentle slopes to the
level of the waters. Those cultivated spots,
perfuming the air with the fragrant blos∣soms
of orange and lemon trees, together
with the view of the first chain of hills
above Lugano, covered with the vine, the
almond, the fig, and the olive, convey to
the English traveller the agreeable idea of a
richer climate, and a more favoured sky.
The frequent steeples list their pointed heads
amidst forests and hanging woods of va∣riegated
trees, and far in the back-ground
huge and lofty mountains rising into Alps,
part of which were capt with snows, seem∣ed
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown with savage but impotent seve∣rity
<PB N="229" REF="248"/>
on the glowing and fertile landscape,
that circled the limpid lake beneath.</P>
<P>On the left of Lugano, the lake runs a
considerable length beyond the Swiss terri∣tory
into the dominions of the Emperor,
and the Valteline, of which we beheld the
villages skirting the waters below project∣ting
rocks.</P>
<P>Having landed on the shore opposite Lu∣gano,
where the mountains rise abrupt from
the lake, shagged with rock and wood,
we entered some of these oval retreats,
which the inhabitants have formed under
the shelter of excavated cliffs, for the pre∣servation
of their wines from the summer
heats: some of the owners of those wines
were on the spot, and cordially invited us
to taste their delicious flavor and coolness.
The sun setting over these hills, and bur∣nishing
the lake with its long reflected
<PB N="230" REF="249"/>
beams, warned us to return. We descended
from the ridge of the mountain, where we
had gone to view the flow of a playful tor∣rent,
and joined a musical fleet of Milanese
ladies and gentlemen, who were sailing to
Lugano to be present at the installation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Installation of the Bailiff of Lugano.—Italian Odes.—
Sail down the Lake.—Locarno.</HEAD>
<P>THE following day was ushered in by a
concert of bells from every steeple in the
town and neighbourhood. The streets
were crouded with well-dressed people of
both sexes, who had come from various
parts of the country, and beyond the lake,
to celebrate the gay festival. After break∣fast
the magnificent deputies of the laudable
Helvetic Body marshalled themselves in or∣der,
and preceded by their heralds, stand∣ard-bearers,
trumpeters, and other attend∣ants,
marched in procession up the hill to
the great church of St. Lugano, where
this solemn ceremony was to take place.
There we found a numerous assemblage of
<PB N="232" REF="251"/>
ladies and gentlemen dressed with elegance,
some of whom had taken possession of the
pulpit, reading-desk, and altar, and were
listening with polite attention to the un∣couth
sounds which issued from the aisle
below, and which must have seemed barbar∣ous
dissonance to the delicacy of an Italian
car. Those inharmonious accents proceeded
from the lips of the Recorder of the baili∣wick,
or the clerk of the magnificent de∣putation,
who was reading, in the Swiss
language, to the new sovereign, the laws,
customs, and regulations, by which he was
to govern, during two years, the noble
town and district of Lugano. For the be∣nefit
of those who were to be governed, and
that no possibility of collusion might take
place, the same engagement which the new
governor had taken in German, he took
afterwards in Italian. No sooner had this
double act been properly administered, and
the people once more secure in the possession
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
their governor, than the vaults of the church
re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded with the cries of <HI>Viva! Viva!</HI>
long live our gracious bailiff, and the most
illustrious deputies of the magnificent Can∣tons
of Switzerland; to which affectionate
exclamation, in the silver sounds of Italian,
German responses were poured forth by the
deputation, of long live the noble city and
bailiwick of Lugano!</P>
<P>That the deputation, with cordial since∣rity,
should pray for long life and health to
the noble town of Lugano, was perfectly
natural; the motives to a reciprocal attach∣ment,
on the part of the bailiwick, are
somewhat less evident.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the sixteenth cen∣tury,
Maximilian Sforza, Duke of Milan,
made a donation of the territory of Lugano
to the Swiss, for the aid they gave him in
driving the French out of Italy, and which
<PB N="234" REF="253"/>
was confirmed three years after by Francis
the First, when he made peace with the
Cantons, whom he had defeated at the fa∣mous
battle of Marignan. As the Swiss
received the gift unincumbered with any
conditions, such as privileges, rights, or
immunities, in favour of the people, so they
have religiously handed it down unchanged
to their posterity. The power of the bailiff
is almost unlimited. He is the representa∣tive
and co-sovereign with the Cantons, the
fountain of all honor, power, and glory,
sole judge in all civil and criminal matters,
but assisted in his important functions by a
syndical, a secretarial, a lieutenant bailiff,
and other officers, so that no complaint
should exist among the people of a scarcity
of persons to govern them.</P>
<P>The municipal regulations, however, of
the towns and villages in the bailiwicks,
are entrusted to persons chosen by the inha∣bitants,
<PB N="235" REF="254"/>
but no laws are enacted that are not
in perfect accord with the will of the sove∣reign,
and submitted to his sanction.</P>
<P>The stated revenue of these bailiwicks is
unfortunately not very considerable, and the
emoluments of the bailiffs chiefly arise
from speculations on the display of the
worst passions of our nature, such as fines
in criminal cases. Much cannot be said of
the paternal protection given to that state,
where the governors become rich in propor∣tion
as their subjects become wicked. Such
sort of financial speculations, we were told,
are too frequently to be found in the history
of Swiss proconsular administration; the la∣titude
of power being almost unbounded,
and the love of money being proverbially
the sin which most easily besets those sove∣reigns,
it is not surprizing that the merit of
disinterestedness should be uncommon.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="255"/>
“The avidity of their governors,” we
are informed by one of their apologists,
“when it passes its <HI>just</HI> bounds, has been
very often repressed by the sydictorial de∣puties,
who are sent to regulate the ac∣counts.”
What are the <HI>just</HI> bounds of a
Swiss bailiff's avidity is not precisely mark∣ed,
but there is reason to believe that it is
not punished by these fraternal deputies
with extreme severity.</P>
<P>The same author laments that the inhabi∣tants
of these bailiwicks are much addicted
to chicane, and that frequent law-suits dis∣turb
the peace of families. This taste for
legal contention is the more singular, as the
disputants are deprived of one considerable
pleasure in the controversy, which is, the
knowledge of the language in which they
contend, all civil causes being tried in Ger∣man.
The bailiffs, who in general are
ignorant of the Italian, are always attended
<PB N="237" REF="256"/>
by interpreters; but who shall translate, for
the benefit of the Italian client, the wordy
war of German attornies?</P>
<P>Whatever grounds of complaint from
proconsular rapacity might have existed in
former times, we were happy to hear,
amidst universal plaudits, of the return of
the golden age under the administration of
the most illustrious Signor Don Francesco
Saverio Zeltner, counsellor and captain of
artillery of the most excellent city and re∣public
of Soleure, who now terminates his
most upright government of captain regent
of Lugano. The administration of this
renewed governor was celebrated in odes,
sonnets, and other poetical records, which
were distributed in the church with great
profusion at the close of the ceremonial.
No Horace or Waller could string the lyre
with fonder raptures to the glories of Au∣gustus
or Cromwell, than that which burst
<PB N="238" REF="257"/>
from the poets of Lugano in praise of their
immortal bailiff. The names of heroes
who lived before Agamemnon have perish∣ed,
we are told, in unknown night, because
unsung by the sacred bard; but the name
of Don Zeltner is proudly rescued from
such vulgar oblivion. We shall pass over
the eulogium of the tribe of poets by pro∣fession,
to whom fiction is allowed as a
matter of right, and shall only slightly men∣tion
the strains of the “Signor Abate Don
Amatore Solari, proregent, professor extra∣ordinary,”
and enjoying numerous other
titles, who had put a new string to his old
discordant harp,
<Q><L>“Da nuovo plettro l'agitata corda,</L>
<L>Tutte di Zeltner le virtu ricorda,”</L></Q>
to record the train of Zeltner's virtues; we
shall not consider too deeply the sorrows of
the noble fiscal Signor Don Pictro Frasca,
<PB N="239" REF="258"/>
doctor of both laws, who demands of his
mournful muse, and not inelegantly—why,
with dishevelled hair, she beats her snowy
bosom, and who answers, by her sighs,
striking on her lyre; “sospiri all' etra—
Ma aimé ch' ei parte”—That Zeltner, the
great hero, is about to depart. Nor shall
we dwell long on the everlasting ode of the
thrice gallant Capuchin P. C. A. Griconi,
who, while others are tuning the string to
the praises of the illustrious Zeltner, is
warbling, with no less harmony, the peer∣less
accomplishments of the most lovely
Signora Donna Orsola Zeltner, his wife:
not forgetting, in the hurry of his pinda∣rics,
that the God of War had entrusted to
the husband
<Q><L>“A te fulmini et falangi</L>
<L>Marte affida,”</L></Q>
his thunder and phalanxes; for which
Signor Prelsoechi accounts in his Anacreon∣tics,
<PB N="240" REF="259"/>
by assuring us, that Don Zeltner is
not of mortal mold;
<Q><L>“Dal ciel costui discende</L>
<L>No che mortal non <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;”</L></Q>
but that he came to Lugano, “Dal Regno de∣gli
Dei,” from the empyrium of the Gods.</P>
<P>Poor is even praise like this, when com∣pared
with the poetical tribute, which the
virtues of Zeltner have wrung from the
brain of the venerable college of respectable
and worshipful notaries of Lugano, the
bankers, trustees, and attornies of every in∣dividual
in the state; who overleaping the
dull, precise, plodding forms of law “be it
known to all men,” and “by these pre∣sents,”
strike the soft chords of poetic eulo∣gy,
and in lays appropriate to their pro∣fessions,
so far as their professions can sym∣pathize
with lays, pour forth a panegyri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="241" REF="260"/>
on the rare disinterestedness and exalted
worth of Capt. Zeltner.</P>
<P>“When Alexander,” sing these tuneful
notaries, “when Alexander returned from
the vanquished Euphrates, loaded with gold
to his native country, and followed by his
armed hosts, fighs of sorrow broke forth
from the bottom of his heart; the bones of
Achilles, which he contemplated on his
way, awoke the ungrateful recollection of
the Achean trumpet, and excited frequent
bursts of envy in the soul of the mighty
conqueror. Thou,” that is, Don Zeltner,
“loaded not with rapacious spoils, but bend∣ing
under the weight of honor, alone hast
to fear no such interruption to the joy,
since thou hast already reached the goal to
which no hero ever yet attained.”</P>
<P>And lest Soleure, in his return, should be
wanting in grateful plaudits to this most il∣lustrious
<PB N="242" REF="261"/>
captain, these Heliconian attornies
kindly communicate a spark of their celes∣tial
fire, and in bold personification intro∣duce
the city herself singing—“O, how
art thou come back, invincible son, rich in
honors, and adorned with <HI>golden</HI> glory!
clemency and justice follow in thy train,
and these are the proud trophics which at∣tend
thee on thy return. Never did the
eastern shores witness so noble a triumph,
or Athens, or Sparta, or any other city
around, as I who hail this happy day,
which gives me back the chief of immortal
heroes. Thus,” add these Bards of Lu∣gano,
“thus thy country sings, unknow∣ing,
Illustrious Zeltner, what car of tri∣umph
to prepare, or what choice garlands
of flowers to weave around thy brow.”</P>

What were the distinguished acts of this
ex-bailiff, which raised him in the songs of
his enthusiastic admirers above Alexander,
or what was the triumph he had merited,
such as Athens or Sparta never witnessed,
we were unable to discover. Zeltner, we
understood from some of his brother depu∣ties,
was a respectable captain of artillery at
Soleure, who, perchance, had never heard
of the bones of Achilles, or the Achean
trumpet, the imitative blast of which was
now to convey his own name to immorta∣lity.</P>
<P>Amidst the croud of Zeltner's virtues,
one, however, appeared prominent; the
burden of the song, stript of its finery, was
to celebrate his return from a rich bailiwick
with a treasury empty or moderately gar∣nished;
and as
<Q>“The Muse forbids the virtuous man to die,”</Q>
<PB N="246" REF="265"/>
it is to be sincerely hoped that this remark∣able
instance of self-denial will not only
consecrate his own name, but that future
bailiffs will imitate this bright model, and
immortalize their governments by affording
such examples of disinterestedness, as shall
encourage the poetical spirit among these
tuneful Italians, who, feeling with our im∣mortal
bard that
<Q><L>“One good deed dying tongueless</L>
<L>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that,”</L></Q>
will in future build the lofty rhyme to every
successive bailiff, and be prodigal of praise,
in proportion as their governors are sparing
of property.</P>
<P>Having yet seen little more than that
part of the lake which forms the bay, on
which the town is situated, and invited by
the beautiful prospect from the terrace of
St. Lawrence, we left the noble company
<PB N="247" REF="266"/>
at Lugano, in the full glow of mutual
compliment and congratulation, to spend
the remainder of the day in sailing along
the shores. The lake about half way down
divides into two branches, one of which
leads to the village of Porto, and the other
to the village called Capo di Lago, the Head
of the Lake, to which we directed our course.
It was the feast of St. Lawrence, and the
whole country seemed animated on the oc∣casion.
After visiting some of the villages
and churches in the neighbourhood, we re∣turned
to Capo di Lago, where a repast was
prepared for us of fine trout just fished
from the lake by our boatmen, who, gues∣sing
that we felt some admiration of grand
scenery, had removed our table from the
house, and spread it under the shade of a
birch tree which hung over the edge of the
waters. We had scarcely finished our fru∣gal
meal, when distant choral sounds, which
came from the adjoining woods that skirted
<PB N="248" REF="267"/>
the lake, stretch upon the ear, and we soon
beheld a long line of priests descending in
their sumptuous robes, preceded by the
banners of religion, and followed by a pro∣cession
of well-dressed villagers of every
age and sex, who were chanting responses
to the sacred hymn.</P>
<P>The philosophers are probably right,
who declaim against the fatal interruptions
to industry, from the frequent festivals in
Catholic countries; yet we could not help
perceiving, in the groupe before us, an air
of satisfaction and happiness, which is the
great end of toil and labour. Perhaps we
were l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to lay our philosophy aside, and
observe the homage paid to St. Lawrence,
with particular complacency, from the gra∣tification
afforded us, by the picturesque
appearance of his votaries, winding down
the mountain with tapers, banners, and cru∣cifixes,
singing the praises of their patron,
<PB N="249" REF="268"/>
and furnishing a spectacle far more strik∣ing
to the imagination, than the useful em∣ployments
of the same class of people on
the other side of the Alps, busied in felling
the noble pine, planting hemp-seed, or hoe∣ing
tobacco.</P>
<P>The setting sun-beams had fallen upon
the lake before we reimbarked, and were
reflected in long columns of light upon its
limpid waters, which were gently agitated
by the soft evening breeze. We had sailed
in the morning down the right side of the
lake, and now returned to Lugano in the
opposite direction along banks, where the
dark rock sometimes rose abrupt, and bare
from the water; but the gay larch that had
struck root in its crev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, softened as it
floated in the air the gloom of its shaggy
brow: and sometimes the olive, and the
fig-tree, though not objects of graceful
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>
form, contrasted agreeably the wildness of
the scene.</P>
<P>In passing before the church of a village,
placed at some little distance on the slope
rising from the lake, and embosomed among
trees, between two steep mountains, we
were again saluted with sacred song. It was
the Vesperal hymn, proceeding from female
voices, flinging its sweet full cadence upon
the breeze, and dying along the waters.</P>
<P>Our boatmen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lackened their oars, and
catching the fond enthusiasm, sung the cho∣rus
in tones far from inharmonious, and in
which they were joined by passengers of
their acquaintance, to whom, with some
confidence in our good nature, they had
given a place in our boat; while, at inter∣vals,
a small company, who were seated on
the edge of the water to enjoy the even∣ing
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>
freshness, caught and prolonged the
notes.</P>
<P>Twilight had spread all its doubtful
shapes and mild gradations over the sha∣dowy
scene before we reached Lugano,
where we found a numerous assemblage
seated on the terrace, opening to the waters,
or sipping lemonade in the cassinos: some
were chanting songs, not in honor of St.
Lawrence, but of their mistresses, and others
forming musical or dancing parties in the
adjoining pavilions; so that the magnificent
high and mighty Lords, the Swiss burgesses,
their sovereigns on the other side of the
mountains, could not be more happy, with
all their power and glory, than their Italian
subjects of the charming regions around
the lake of Lugano.</P>
<P>The town of Lugano is the seat of busi∣ness
as well as pleasure, being from the na∣vigation
<PB N="252" REF="271"/>
of the lake, the chief entrepot of
the commerce carried on between the nor∣thern
part of Italy, and the countries beyond
the Alps. There is also a printing esta∣blishment
in this town, where the proprietor
of a Gazette, called The Lugano Journal,
has the boldness, under the rod of power,
to record the political events of the times
with truth and impartiality.</P>
<P>Having finished our excursions in the en∣virons
of this beautiful country, we return∣ed
in a more southerly direction over Mount
Cenere, towards the Lago Maggiore. The
view from the summit of the mountain,
over the extensive lake, stretching to the
Borromean Islands, and the fertile plains of
Lombardy, is highly magnificent. Those
far-famed islands, we were obliged, from
political considerations, to leave unvisited,
not without a sigh of regret on my part,
that since Swiss territory extended so far be∣yond
<PB N="253" REF="272"/>
its natural boundary the Alps, it had
not repelled the limit of the Emperor's do∣minions
a little farther. At the village of
Meggedino, lying at the foot of Mount
Cenere, we took a boat, and in two hours
were conveyed across the lake to Locarno;
which town is situated on its eastern side,
and forms a picturesque object beneath steep
mountains.</P>
<P>This bailiwick, about fifteen miles in
length and breadth, abounding in pasturage,
wines, and fruits, was given like Lugano
to the Swiss Cantons by the Duke of
Milan.</P>
<P>On our landing, finding the streets a de∣sert,
we strayed through the town in search
of its inhabitants, whom we found assem∣bled
in and around a church, preparing
themselves for a solemn service, which was
to take place the following day. We ram∣bled
<PB N="254" REF="273"/>
through the town; parts of which are
pleasant, but it wears upon the whole a dull
and monastic appearance. If one may
judge from the number of churches, priests,
and convents, compared with the number of
houses and inhabitants, there is no spot
among these mountains, where a person
may escape so entirely from the bustle
of this world, and find so many guides
to conduct him to another. The inhabi∣tants,
we were told, had lately been
increased by a class of unfortunate French,
whose prospects were then falling fast into
the shade. We saw a number of them
sauntering idly along the walks; and as all
evils are relative, it was impossible to ob∣serve,
without sympathy, those once gay
and gallant nobles, wearing out life in the
listless solitude of Locarno.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Storm on the Lake.—Return to Bellinzone.—Visit to a
Convent.—Installation of the Bailiff of Bellinzone.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the inconveniences of travelling
in mountainous countries, is the extreme
capriciousness of the weather. Amidst
those regions of storm, the unsheltered tra∣veller
feels the full blast as it comes fresh
from the airy cavern; but no where is its
violence so dangerous as on the lakes,
which, enclosed between lofty mountains,
receive the strong currents of the tempestu∣ous
winds in their struggle through the
narrow spaces, and suddenly raise their
troubled waters into foaming fury. The
extreme heat of the weather had long pre∣saged
a thunder storm; but although we
saw clouds at a remote distance gathering on
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>
the summits, we had little apprehension on
embarking, that we should feel their dis∣charge
before we reached the opposite
shore.</P>
<P>Our boatmen, more experienced than
ourselves, had warned my companions, as
I was afterwards informed, that the breeze
was on its way, and offered to return the fol∣lowing
morning; but among my fellow tra∣vellers
were three Englishmen, and the news∣papers
waited for them at Bellinzone. Storms,
when weighed against newspapers, were
found light in the balance, and the vessel
was ordered to be got ready. We had nearly
reached the middle of the lake, before the
tempest, which we saw gathering thicker
on the hills, began to agitate the waters.
At first the lightning flashing in white
fantastic streaks, and the lofty thunder echo∣ing
along the mountains, were objects of
pleasing, though awful admiration; and we
<PB N="257" REF="276"/>
were indulging ourselves with the hope,
that the storm was passing away harmless,
when a burst of wind struck on the lake,
and threw the foaming waters into our
bark. It was too late to return, since the
wind rushing down the lake, which we
were crossing, would have rendered retreat
as difficult as going forward.</P>
<P>The storm increased every moment, and
the boatmen attempted to make land at any
point, but their efforts were ineffectual.
Our progress was so slow in the struggle
with the waves, that we feared night would
overtake us before we could reach the
shore; and every person in the boat becom∣ing
sensible of the danger, seized the oar,
and relieved each other by turns.</P>
<P>After much terror on my part, and much
labor on that of my fellow travellers, per∣haps
mingled with a wish, that they had
<PB N="258" REF="277"/>
left Europe to its fate till the next morn∣ing,
we reached a distant part of the shore,
where, sheltered from the tempest, which
continued with unabated fury, we coasted
it back, finding it impracticable to land,
and arrived at Maggedino towards the close
of the evening. We were still nine or ten
miles distant from Bellinzone, and were
harassed and fatigued; but an obstacle pre∣sented
itself more insurmountable than the
Gazettes to our remaining in this village,
which was the want of every kind of ac∣commodation,
either of food or lodging.
We recollected also, that we were at the
foot of Mount Cenere, the haunt of robbers
and assassins; and there was nothing in the
looks of those we saw around us to inspire
confidence. While we were deliberating
what course we should pursue, undecided be∣tween
the danger of remaining in this insu∣lated
spot, and the inconveniences we should
suffer in braving the tempest, the ceasing
<PB N="259" REF="278"/>
of the rain decided us to go on to Bel∣linzone.</P>
<P>Unacquainted with the road, and afraid
to ask a guide of the surly host, we had
not proceeded far, when it became so dark,
that we could perceive no object, but by
the frequent flashes of lightning darting
from the livid clouds, while sometimes the
menacing roar of torrents, rushing fresh
from the hills across our way, was unheard
amidst loud bursts of thunder. We were
almost in a situation of as much danger as
on the lake, since we knew, that before we
reached Bellinzone, we had a considerable
stream to cross, and feared, that swelled by
rains from the hills, it might have become
impassable. In this perplexity, a friendly
light appeared at a distance, which pro∣ceeded
from the window of the Curé of an
hamlet we were approaching. He invited
us to enter, but we put his politeness to no
<PB N="260" REF="279"/>
further test than requesting his interposition
with some of his parishioners for a guide,
which he immediately went to a neigh∣bouring
hut to procure, and under his au∣spices
we reached, after midnight, Bellin∣zone
and the journals.</P>
<P>Bellinzone, the joint property of the Can∣tons
of Uri, Schweitz, and Under-walden,
was originally, like the other Italian baili∣wicks,
part of the hereditary possessions of
the Duke of Milan. In the beginning of
the fifteenth century the Barons of Misa, in
the Grisons, who had won this territory
from the Milanese, sold it to the Cantons
of Uri and Underwalden, together with the
districts of Bolleny and Riviera, for two
thousand four hundred florins. The Duke
of Milan, desirous of regaining this part of
his hereditary dominions, offered to pay the
Swiss the money they had advanced, but
feeling that they had made a good bargain
<PB N="261" REF="280"/>
with the Barons of Saxe, they were not dis∣posed
to treat upon the same terms with the
Duke of Milan, who, after much fruitless
negociation for the purchase, concluded the
affair by seizing on this important key to
his states, which he took by surprise. All
the Cantons, except Berne, armed to avenge
the outrage of thus possessing himself of a
town which had been bought and paid for;
but after a fierce struggle, the Swiss were
obliged to relinquish the contest, and left, in
the piles of bones that adorn the chapel of
St. Paul, near Bellinzone, the scene of one of
their most celebrated battles, a monument,
not only of their heroic valour, but perhaps
also of their folly, in passing their moun∣tains
to mingle in the quarrels of other
states. After this severe lesson, the Swiss,
convinced that no solid advantages could
result from the conflict, however gloriously
maintained, concluded a peace with the
Duke of Milan in 1426, by which they
<PB N="262" REF="281"/>
surrendered all their territory on the Italian
side of the Alps, on condition of being al∣lowed
certain exclusive advantages in their
commerce with the Milanese states, and re∣ceiving
ten times the sum for which they
had purchased Bellinzone. In the beginning
of the sixteenth century, during the frequent
revolutions in Lombardy, the inhabitants
revolted, and placed themselves under the
protection of the three Cantons; Sforza,
Duke of Milan, and Francis the First,
gave up their respective claims, and the
Swiss have ever since retained possession of
this bailiwick.</P>
<P>Bellinzone is rich in fine churches dedi∣cated
to St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Blaise,
and St. Rock; here are also numerous con∣vents
of Augstines, Ursulines, and Recol∣lects,
which we visited under the auspices
of a very intelligent and amiable emigrant
priest. There was little to attract the no∣tice
<PB N="263" REF="282"/>
of travellers in these calm retreats of
ignorace and devotion; though the good
monk, who shewed us the treasures of his
convent, situated beyond the German gate
of Bellinzone, intreated we would consider,
with attention, a picture hanging on the
wall of a chapel, which he assured us was a
piece of singular value, being a true copy of
the Virgin, executed by one of the apostles,
and which, having been lost in Turkey,
was found stuck in the walls of a church at
Rome, without the aid of any visible agent
to transport it thither. He was proceeding
with stedfast gravity, to give a large detail
of the history for our edification, when he
understood, by the blush which arose in the
countenance of our more sagacious priest,
for the honor of his religion, degraded by
such fables, that the miracle was breathed
into the ear of heretics.</P>
<P>We also visited the convent, or rather se∣minary,
<PB N="264" REF="283"/>
called the Residence, where we
were received with the most cordial polite∣ness
by the superior, a man of erudition,
with amiable manners, and a much more
agreeable countenance and figure than was
necessary for a monk. In this seminary
there are professors of the languages, of mo∣ral
and natural philosophy, and a library,
which, considering the scarcity of literature
in this country, was very respectable.
Young persons are boarded and educated for
about twelve pounds a-year, and the chil∣dren
of the town and neighbourhood receive
their education without any expence. This
convent has been lately founded, for the
building is scarcely finished, with a part of
the superfluous wealth of the Abbey of Ein∣silden;
and happy would it have been if
monastic wealth and influence had always
been employed to such useful and beneficent
purposes.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="284"/>
The superior, who has the title of pre∣vot,
has written a manual of education for
the democratic Cantons, of which he pre∣sented
us with a copy. Admission to the
interior of this convent is not allowed to fe∣males;
and the exception in my favour was
a privilege of no little distinction; some of
the long galleries, at the end of which we
passed, were, however, forbidden ground
to a female foot, as I perceived, by the po∣lite
observation of the superior, that his ju∣risdiction
extended only to certain parts of
the house, one of which was his own pri∣vate
apartment, where we found not only
books in great profusion, but hospitable re∣freshments
of every kind.</P>
<P>The administration of this province, like
those of Lugano and Locarno, is remitted
every two years to a new bailiff. As this event
was about to take place, we remained a few
days longer, in order to observe whether the
<PB N="266" REF="285"/>
Muses of Bellinzone twined laurels round
their bailiff's brow with as lavish profusion
as those of Lugano. The morning of this
distinguished day was spent in marshalling
such of the inhabitants and officers of state
as were to go out to meet the new bailiff,
and conduct him in procession to his new
government. In the evening we beheld the
august train, glittering in long gold-laced
cloaks, mounted on fiery coursers, and pre∣ceded
by trumpets, winding along the val∣ley.
On their approach within sight of the
town, the cannon on the ramparts of the
three castles fired alternately a long salute,
the roar of which, re-echoing amidst the
mountains in a vast variety of successive
sounds, was by far the most interesting part
of the ceremony.</P>
<P>The next morning, after the celebration
of mass, the new bailiff was installed
with nearly the same solemnity as at Lu∣gano,
<PB N="267" REF="286"/>
with respect to form, but with less
splendor as to the effect. Few appeared to
feel any interest in the confecration, except
those who were immediately concerned in
the distribution of the power or the profits
of this high dignity, the amount of which
last, we understood, was inconsiderable,
when the compliments were deducted that
are paid by the new bailiff to his brother
sovereigns on his nomination. Singular
anecdotes are related of the frank and un∣disguised
manner in which these matters are
arranged at the place of election, and which
display the character of “that fierce demo∣cracy”
in no very proud point of view.</P>
<P>The knowledge of those histories is not
lost on the people, and it is easy to perceive
that they begin to regard their bailiffs rather
as tax-gatherers, legalised to plunder them,
than upright distributors of justice, the pre∣servers
of their prosperity and peace.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="287"/>
Of the virtues or excellencies of the new
governor nothing had yet transpired, but
we were left in no uncertainty respecting
those of the ex-bailiff, Don Francesco
Aloisco Wirsch, of the illustrious Republic
of Underwald, and first captain of the
Swiss regiment of Underwald in Spain, in
whose praises we found the bards of Bel∣linzone
even more sublimely tuneful than
the lyrics of Lugano. The poets laureat of
Captain Zeltner had only raised him above
Alexander, and made him merely equal to
the gods, comparing the triumphs of So∣leure
to those of Athens and Sparta, and
thus bounding our imagination to the he∣roes
of Greece and Macedonia; but Captain
Wirsch's poet, raised into more than Virgi∣lian
rapture, with “a master's hand and
prophet's fire,” thus strikes the immortal
string:</P>
<P>Exult, break forth in songs—O, Under∣walden,
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>
for thy great son returns to his na∣tive
shores—what an immortal splendor
gracefully plays around him! alike only to
himself, “none but himself can be his pa∣rallel.”
—The Holy Virgin descending from
heaven, the object of our adoration and
worship, takes him by the hand, and be∣stows
on him a profusion of tender caresses.
O, Underwalden, after Wirsch, the object
of our idolatry, send us another soul of
celestial mold, for souls of celestial mold
are the prolific produce of thy happy soil.</P>

<P>Such is the style of panegyric, with
which these subtle Italians attempt to soften
the native hardness of their German bailiffs,
and seek to wheedle succeeding governors
into courteous behaviour, by persuading Mr.
Zeltner, that he is equal to the gods, from
whom he descended, and Mr. Wirsch, that
he is like no one but himself, and the favo∣rite
of the Queen of Heaven. Had these
sonnets proceeded from the pen of some
comic rhymester, who chose to amuse him∣self
at the expence of bailiffs, we should
only smile at the pleasantry; but when we
behold the various corporations of these
provinces, ecclesiastical and civil, gravely
presenting such abject and impious flattery,
we scarcely know whether our indignation
is most excited by the meanness that de∣grades
<PB N="271" REF="290"/>
itself to offer this vile adulation, or
the miserable vanity that stoops to re∣ceive
it.</P>
<P>The conquered nations of Asia, we are
told by the historians, were the first inven∣tors
of this servile mode of paneygric, and
the governors of those provinces its first
objects. The Roman proconsul, who de∣parted
a citizen from the free and equal seat
of government, became at once a provincial
divinity, with altars and sacrifices. We
blush to hear Cicero requesting his brother
Quintius to construct a temple to his fame,
or increase the number of his statues. The
subjects of Lugano sooth their conquerors
by cheaper arts, the labors of the song. The
principle of Swiss government in these bai∣liwicks,
is, no doubt, contrary to every in∣stitution
of liberty; yet as in some reli∣gions
the conduct of their professors is often
more humane than their creed, so in these
<PB N="272" REF="291"/>
governors, if we do not find the wisdom
and virtue of Cicero, or any other of his
qualities, except his vanity, we are at least
happy in meeting with no imitators of

were gilded by the charm of her society. I
will not name the valley, where I found
her, and by so doing expose her cottage to
the profane gaze of curiosity: but without
discovering her abode, I may safely describe
its situation; since in that romantic country,
how many cottages are placed, like hers,
<PB N="274" REF="293"/>
near the steep bank of a torrent stream, sur∣rounded
by luxuriant vegetation, veiled by
festoons of vines, sheltered above by the
hanging woods of fir and pine, and bounded
far beyond by the bare rock, and the shin∣ing
Glacier.</P>
<P>In one of our rambles, at some distance
from Bellinzone, we ascended a mountain,
the summit of which, we were told, com∣manded
a prospect that would repay us for
the toil. The path, however, we found,
not merely steep, but so rugged, that before
we had ascended half way, we were obliged
to alight from our horses, and the evening
being too far advanced to admit of our
reaching the summit, and returning on foot
we agreed to walk down the mountain, and
take a ride along the valley. The gentle∣men,
who were with me, led their horses,
our guide had charge of mine, and I fol∣lowed
them down the narrow shadowy
<PB N="275" REF="294"/>
path, sometimes loitering behind to gaze
upon the wild and romantic character of the
scene around me; sometimes pausing to
catch the shifting lights amidst the rude
foliage, till I lost sight of my fellow tra∣vellers,
and soon after reached a spot where
two paths met. I could not recollect by
which we had mounted, and after some
hesitation took the wrong path, hastening
my pace, though the descent was difficult,
in hopes of rejoining my fellow-travellers.
After descending a considerable time with∣out
meeting any human figure, or perceiv∣ing
any human habitation, I reached at
length the base of the mountain, where I
found some scattered hamlets encircled with
vineyards, and entered them in search of a
guide. But the cottagers were at their la∣bours
in the valley, and these little dwell∣ings
were deserted of their inhabitants. The
evening was now advancing, and Bellinzone
was too distant to be reached on foot till
<PB N="276" REF="295"/>
late in the night. Nor was the idea of a
solitary walk in darkness agreeable, in a
country often infested by banditti, who
find a retreat amidst the wild haunts of
Mount Cenere.</P>
<P>About a league from Bellinzone, we had
been shewn the spot where a traveller was
murdered a week before our arrival; and
we had seen a picturesque promontory of
the lovely Lake of Lugano, deformed by
the hideous spectacle of two men hung in
gibbets. The character of the lower order
of people, amidst those mountains, had ap∣peared
to us somewhat savage; and al∣though
I should have felt myself perfectly
safe under the shelter of a Swiss cottage, on
the other side of the Alps, I had here no
such persuasion of security. After some deli∣beration,
I determined to wait near the cot∣tages
for the return of the labourers; and if
my fellow travellers, who were doubtless in
<PB N="277" REF="296"/>
search of me, did not arrive before that
time, to hire an horse and guide to Bellin∣zone.
I sat down on the fragment of a
rock, musing on the singularity of my situa∣tion,
when I heard the approach of foot∣steps,
behind me, and turning my head,
saw a lady and gentleman coming along a
narrow path, which led to the spot where
I was seated. I rose immediately, and ad∣vanced
towards them, related my adven∣ture,
and asked their advice and assistance.
The lady, taking my hand with a sweet
smile, and a look of benevolence, told me
how fortunate she considered herself in be∣ing
able to render me any service. After
making known her name, which denoted
high nobility, this emigrant lady, for such
she was, intreated me to allow her to con∣duct
me to her cottage, which was within
a few paces of the spot where we stood;
but persuaded that my fellow travellers
were in search of me, I preferred remaining
<PB N="278" REF="297"/>
within sight of the road, and was anxious
to lose no time in taking measures for re∣turning
to Bellinzone.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that a peasant of a neigh∣bouring
cottage, whom the lady told me
she could safely recommend, should procure
me an horse, and convey me to Bellinzone;
the gentleman regretting that illness put it
out of his power to conduct me himself;
the truth of which assertion his pale coun∣tenance
and emaciated figure sufficiently
evinced. While we were arranging these
matters, a little rosy-cheeked boy, of three
years of age, who had been sporting up and
down the mountain-path, as lightly as the
playful chamois, came springing to his
mama, and announced the approach of
strangers. A few minutes after my fellow
travellers, who had re-ascended the moun∣tain
a considerable way in search of me, by
a different path from that which I had
<PB N="279" REF="298"/>
taken, appeared: the horses were waiting
in a little nook, at no great distance, and I
hastily took leave of my new acquaintances,
but not till the lady, who bade me fare∣well,
with kind reluctance, had made me
promise to return with my friends the next
morning, to breakfast at her cottage.</P>
<P>During our ride home, and the whole of
the evening; I could think and talk of no∣thing
but the charming countenance of
Madame de C—: I tried it by all the
rules of Lavater, and was probably a better
physiognomist than usual, having so lately
heard the subject descanted with a master's
art; for it is certain, that on this occasion,
my judgment was unerring.</P>
<P>The next morning we set out to break∣fast
at the cottage: my spirits were exhila∣rated
with the thoughts of visiting my
new acquaintance, and I enjoyed more than
<PB N="280" REF="299"/>
usually the beauties of the wild romantic
valley, along which we rode, and which
was gilded with gay sunshine. A torrent
stream rolls noisily over its stony bed in the
midst of this woody vale, which is rich
with pasturage, and bounded on each side
by lofty rocks and mountains, while that
chain of Glaciers, from which the Rhine
pours its source, lift their eternal snows in
the distance, and cool the air in the valley.</P>
<P>Fragments of rock were strewed on the
edge of our path, and on one spot the
vestiges of an avalanche appeared in heaps
of massy stones, mingled with the ruins of
devastated cottages, and gave a savage wild∣ness
to the scene. Soon after crossing a
light arched bridge, over-grown with la∣vish
folds of ivy, we reached the mountain,
at the foot of which was placed the vine∣covered
cottage of Madame C—: her
sweet little boy stood at the door, watching
<PB N="281" REF="300"/>
for our arrival. He danced with delight,
while we dismounted; and the moment he
could reach me, gracefully kissed my hand,
which is one of the first things little French
boys are taught to do, and then galloped
away in search of his mama.</P>
<P>The cottage, which was perfectly neat,
contained a little plain furniture, two frames
filled with ornamental work, a table heaped
with drawings, and a small shelf, on which
a few books were ranged. Madame de
C—received us with animated plea∣sure,
and her husband expressed as much sa∣tisfaction
as the languor of ill health seemed
to admit. Victoire, a smart brown girl,
whom on a Swiss mountain, or in any other
remote region, where I had met her, I
should immediately have recognized by a
gracefully familiar ease of manner, temper∣ed
with the most profound respect, for a
Parisian <HI>fille de chambre,</HI> prepared the break∣fast
<PB N="282" REF="301"/>
fast with a light elastic step, and a look of
chearful alacrity.</P>
<P>Madame de C—'s conversation shed
flowers over the repast; there was something
like enchantment in finding in a rude ham∣let,
at the foot of savage rocks, and untrod∣den
Glaciers, the most polished graces of
intellectual culture; and united with a su∣perior
understanding, with a taste for all
that is elegant in the arts, and an enthusiasm
for all that is sublime in nature, that cordial
warmth of manner, that fascinating frank∣ness,
when the soul seems to hang upon the
lips, and the glowing expression of its sen∣sibility
exerts an irresistible influence over
the hearts of others. Mons. de C—,
an amiable and accomplished man, appeared
to be in a state of dejection, which it cost
him an effort to conceal, but which his wife
was evidently at pains to cheer. After
breakfast, Madame C—proposed a walk
<PB N="283" REF="302"/>
amidst some of the wildest haunts of that
romantic region, where she told me she sel∣dom
met any human creature, and therefore
considered that portion of the valley as her
own territory.</P>
<P>Before we set out, Victoire, who seemed
not a little anxious to know “my opinion
of things in general” at Paris, was so ex∣tremely
voluble in her inquiries, that I
found it impossible for my answers to keep
any pace with her questions. Victoire's mind
was fertile in suppositions, as well as in∣quiries;
she supposed the monsters had, by
this time, sown all the Tuilleries with pota∣toes,
and dug up the houses as well as the
cellars for salt-petre, and made all the wo∣men
wear red caps; as if it was not bad
enough to be forced to stick on à cockade,
or be dragged to prison by those horrid
<HI>sans-culottes,</HI> calling themselves Brutus and
Aristides. She supposed too they still went
<PB N="284" REF="303"/>
on with their saucy <HI>tutoiment</HI> and <HI>citoyenne,</HI>
to the women—she did not know why the
brutes dared to call her <HI>citoyenne,</HI> she, who
had lived all her life at Versailles, and wait∣ed
only on court ladies.</P>
<P>Victoire proceeded in her observations till
I interrupted her by remarking, that she
must no doubt find herself very happy at
such a safe distance from Paris, among those
fine mountains.—“Ah, Madame,” inter∣rupted
Victoire, “happy among the sa∣vages
here, who can't speak one word of
French!—Oh, what I would sometimes
give for a walk upon the Boulevards! I am
so tired of rocks and snows!—if it was
not for the pleasure of serving my dear
lady, I believe I should go back and have
my head cut off—for I'm too well known
in Paris to escape—and yet, I must own
the truth, I did all I could to make my
lady come away; for certainly, when all
<PB N="285" REF="304"/>
the <HI>haute noblesse</HI> were gone, my lady, as I
told her, was not made to stay behind—
and, indeed,” added Victoire, “I was
ashamed myself of being seen in Paris, for
all the <HI>femmes de chambres</HI> of my acquaint∣ance
had emigrated an age before.” Upon
the whole I observed, from Victoire's con∣versation,
that her wrath and indignation
against the Jacobins was almost entirely
confined to their <HI>grossiéreté;</HI> as for their
cruelty, that seemed to come within the
pale of her forgiveness; but to put inno∣cent
people to death, and be <HI>mal-honnête,
en outre,</HI> she considered as quite unpardon∣able.</P>
<P>After a delightful ramble amidst the pic∣turesque
scenes of that wild country, Ma∣dame
C—and myself seated ourselves on
a spot of turf, and left the rest of the company
to extend their walk. Here, laying aside
the tone of general conversation, Madame
<PB N="286" REF="305"/>
de C—related to me the particulars of
her situation, which she probably saw I was
anxious to know, more from a sentiment of
sympathy, than a principle of curiosity.
Nor should it be thought singular that she
confided her story to a stranger; even an
English woman, in that distant region,
surrounded only by half-civilized moun∣taineers,
would have felt confidence spring∣ing
in her bosom towards a person who
could understand and pity her feelings; but
it required less than the solitude of Alpine
mountains to have led Madame C—to
unfold her heart. The French are natu∣rally
communicative; they neither practice,
nor comprehend, that reserve which be∣longs
to the English character, and which
sometimes has its source in delicacy, some∣times
in pride.</P>
<P>Whatever the French feel or suffer, hope
or fear is readily imparted to the whole cir∣cle
<PB N="287" REF="306"/>
of their society; even personal infirmi∣ties
and mental defects, of which the pos∣sessor
happens to be conscious, are all made
known without hesitation; poverty itself,
which in England we are so careful to con∣ceal,
costs the French no such trouble; nor
have they any idea of enduring the smallest
privation, in order to hide their circum∣stances
or make a better appearance to the
world.</P>
<P>But to return to Madame C—, who
was the daughter of a nobleman of high
rank, and who, at sixteen years of age, had
married Mons. C—, by whom she was
passionately beloved. That Madame C—
was beloved, I could very easily believe,
while I discerned the graces of her mind,
and beheld the fine expression of her coun∣tenance,
form which sorrow, not time, for
she was now only in her twenty-fourth
year, had snatched the first fresh tints of
<PB N="288" REF="307"/>
beauty, but had left an expression which
blended a more tender sentiment with ad∣miration.
Mons. C—, who detested
the principles of the revolution as cordially
as most men of the same rank, was only
prevented from emigrating when first that
event took place, by the representations of
his wife, whose more enlarged mind exult∣ed
in that change of system which she dared
not openly applaud: she had often wept over
the miseries of the oppressed people, and was
more disposed to rejoice in the amelioration
of solid substantial wretchedness, than to la∣ment
the ideal deprivations of greatness.
After the memorable tenth of August, she
had no longer power, however, to restrain
her husband from emigrating, and consider∣ing
it as her first duty to follow his for∣tunes,
and share his destiny, she was only
prevented from going with him by his de∣sire
that she should endeavour to preserve
their property, by remaining in France till
<PB N="289" REF="308"/>
the counter-revolution arrived, which he
was firmly persuaded was at no great dis∣stance.
After making the tour of Switzer∣land,
he crossed the Alps with a party of
emigrants, and finding, that although the
counter-revolution was on its way, its
march was less rapid than he had expected,
determined to wait for that event at Bellin∣zone.
Not long after, that ferocious ty∣ranny
with its train of horrors, to which
regal despotism was mild, and all its abuses
light, established itself in France. Madame
de C—'s correspondence became every
day more difficult and dangerous, and at
length the friend to whom his letters were
addressed declared, that if this epistolary in∣tercourse
was continued, it would lead not
only himself, but Madame C—, to the
scaffold.</P>
<P>Deprived of all communication with her
husband, and a melancholy witness of
<PB N="290" REF="309"/>
crimes which she execrated, and of miseries
which she deplored, she soon became her∣self
involved in the general calamity. All
the property of Mons. C—was seques∣tered,
and the seals were placed upon every
apartment of his hotel, after a strict search
had been made for Madame C—, who
escaped imprisonment by having found a
temporary shelter for herself and her little
boy, in the house of her friend. This person,
a man of sense and virtue, who, abhorrent
of the sanguinary measures which then pre∣vailed,
had, from circumstances of a private
nature, some influence with one high in
power, and was ever ready to employ that
influence for the purpose of doing good, or
rather of averting evil, found means to
snatch Madame C—from danger, by
obtaining passports for her and Victoire, as
the wives of two Swiss traders, who had
come to Paris upon affairs of commerce,
and were returning to their own country.
<PB N="291" REF="310"/>
Madame C—, after thanking her friend
for life, since life was then included in the
gift of a passport, set off in the diligence to
Basil, with her little boy in her arms, and
accompanied by Victoire.</P>
<P>During the journey Madame C—had
many alarms on account of the intemperate
resentments of her waiting-woman, who,
whenever any incident happened by which
she was offended, was ready to betray all.
Victoire was astonished that nobody found
out that she was the <HI>femme de chambre</HI> of
the lady of a <HI>cordon rouge,</HI> and was as an∣gry
at what she considered as disrespect, to
use the words of Johnson, as “the Czar
of Muscovy, when he passed through Swe∣den
in disguise.” It required many a private
lecture, during the route, from Madame
C—, to make Victoire preserve the in∣cognita;
she longed to burst upon the im∣pertinent
fellow-travellers, who greeted her
<PB N="292" REF="311"/>
with <HI>tu toi, citoyenne,</HI> and <HI>egalité,</HI> with a
detail of all the former splendour of her
lady, a large portion of which she consi∣dered
as reflected upon herself. She owned
that she was dying to tell them, that they
were not fit comany for the anti-chamber,
and that this was the first time she herself
had ever travelled in a diligence. Madame
C—promised Victoire that she should
tell all, and act the duchess if she pleased,
when once they had passed the frontier, but
conjured her in the mean time, if she valued
her life, to be silent; this, however, did
not prevent Victoire from declaring to an
inn-keeper, who she thought had used too
familiar a tone, that she would take care to
prevent Monsieur from ever employing his
house again; upon which she was heartily
abused as the diligence drove off, and met
with the usual Jacobin reproof for making
use of that appellation, by beig told that
Monsieur was at Coblentz.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="312"/>
Madame C—, in spite of the impru∣dent
sallies of her waiting-woman, and
some inquiries in the artless accents of her
little boy after his papa's coach and four,
reached Basil in safety, where she had no
sooner taken possession of an apartment at
the inn, than Victoire endeavoured to com∣pensate
herself for the restraints of the
journey, by bawling out her mistress's ti∣tles
to every waiter in the house, and re∣counting,
with extraordinary volubility, the
indignities they had suffered on the road.
Poor Victoire, however, met with far less
sympathy than she expected, her mistress
having, unfortunately for the effect of her
harangues, stopped at the Three Kings,
which is the resort of the French Repub∣licans,
instead of going to the Stork, which
is supported by the French Emigrants, and
where her tales of plebeian impertinence
would have produced a becoming horror.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="313"/>
After one night's repose, Madame C—
having written to announce her arrival to
her husband, and intreat him to meet her
at Lucerne, immediately proceeded thither.
Two days she waited impatiently at Lu∣cerne
without any tidings of Mons. C—,
and fearing that her letter had miscarried,
determined, without further delay, to cross
the Alps, and joyfully surprize him by her
appearance at Bellinzone. As she drew
near that city her heart swelled with al∣most
incontrolable emotion—her husband
had, in some of his first letters to her, de∣scribed
the landscape so much in detail,
that every object seemed to bring his image
more vividly to her mind. As she passed
over the bridge, about a mile from the
town, and saw at a little distance on the
right the Moesa and the Tessino mingling
their streams together, she recollected his
having told her, that often on the spot
where their waters met, he leant whole
<PB N="295" REF="314"/>
hours in melancholy musing over their
blended currents. She gazed eagerly, as she
approached the town, at the three frowning
castles that crown the lofty hills, where suc∣cessively
reside the sovereign bailiffs of the
subject valley in which Bellinzone is
placed. Mons. C—had climbed these
hills, had traced the scene inclosed between
their rocky heights, and stretching beyond
the romantic valley leading to the Italian
part of the Grison territory. Mad. C—
passed through the gates of Bellinzone, her
heart throbbing with those overwhelming,
those delicious sensations, which are felt
when we expect, in a few short moments,
again to behold the object of our dearest
affections, after a separation embittered by
the pangs of calamity, and the apprehen∣sions
of danger. Those delightful emotions
flushed her cheek with the glow of ani∣mated
hope, and bathed her eyes with those
luxurious tears, which are the attribute of
<PB N="296" REF="315"/>
tender happiness. Madame C—, with
her little suite, rode up to the inn, where her
husband lived at Bellinzone, and eagerly
looked round as she dismounted, in hopes
that her letters had by this time arrives,
and that the trampling of the horses feet
had led him to the door; for her heart told
her how wakefully, had he been expected,
she would have listened to every sound
that could denote his approach, and how
quickly she would have sprung to welcome
him.</P>
<P>“Where is Mons. C—?” she in∣quired,
with precipitation, not seeing him
appear. Mons. C—, the people of the
inn informed her, had left their house three
months since.—“ Where, where is he
gone?” exclaimed Madame C—, her
heart sickening with disappointment.—He
was gone to Constance; but this was not
all—he was gone with Madame—,
<PB N="297" REF="316"/>
who found Bellinzone too dull for a longer
residence. Madame C—, without utter∣ing
another word, followed the inn-keeper
into the house, but before she had reached
the apartment allotted for her fell senseless
on the ground: she was carried into her
chamber, and laid upon a bed, where, on
recovering, she found Victoire anxiously
watching at her side. The unfortunate
Madame C—was only restored to a dis∣tracting
sense of misery; of a species of
misery, which her feeling heart was least
able to sustain, that of being forsaken by
him, whom she loved with the most ten∣der,
the most inviolable attachment.</P>
<P>Involved in the consequences of his emi∣gration,
she had been forced to bid a final
adieu to her country; her country, which
she believed would one day shake off the
horrible tyranny under which it then groan∣ed,
and which she abandoned for ever with
<PB N="298" REF="317"/>
regret; since she felt powerfully that local
attachment, which a cold supercilious phi∣losophy
may call prejudice, but of which a
mind of sensibility is ever strongly suscepti∣ble;
in consequence of his emigration she
had lost all chance of retaining that ample
property, which was the splendid inherit∣ance
of her child: without sharing the in∣temperate
violence of his political opinions,
she had determined to share his misfor∣tunes,
and soften that eternal exile to which
she flew with reluctance, but which had
been his voluntary choice. To be forsaken
by him, forsaken at the very moment when
mutual confidence, and unshaken fidelity
and attachment, were the dear sole refuge
left against the storms of fate, was anguish
insupportable. How keenly did her break∣ing
heart feel the sentiment, which our di∣vine
poet has expressed—</P>
<Q><PB N="299" REF="318"/>
<L>“Had it pleased heaven</L>
<L>To try me with affliction, had he rain'd</L>
<L>All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,</L>
<L>Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,</L>
<L>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,</L>
<L>I could have found in some place of my soul</L>
<L>A drop of patience—</L>
<L>But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,</L>
<L>Where either I must live, or bear no life,</L>
<L>—to be discarded thence!”—</L></Q>
<P>Madame C—knew too well the cha∣racter
of the lady, who was the companion
of her husband's flight, to doubt of his in∣fidelity.
Madame de—was a Parisian
lady of high rank, who had been distin∣guished
in the ancient regime for the bril∣liancy
of her coteries, and the number of
her adorers. Exquisitely skilled in all
those meretricious arts, which too often
captivate the senses of the Lords of Crea∣tion,
without leave of their reason, and even
in opposition to all their better feelings,
Madame de—had for many years en∣chained
<PB N="300" REF="319"/>
in quick succession more captives
than she could count at her triumphal car;
had disturbed the peace of a great number
of families; had broken the heart of many
a tender female, from whom she had
alienated the affections of a beloved hus∣band,
by those seductions which spread an
aliuring drapery over the form of vice,
and render the simple charms of virtuous
love insipid to the vitiated fancy. Madame
de—was publicly known to be a wo∣man
of galantry, but this by no means pre∣vented
her being perfectly well received
in the first circles of fashion, where she was
certain to find many who rivaled her in li∣centious
dispositions, but none who eclipsed
her in Circean graces.</P>
<P>Though her youth was now past, her
person was still attractive, and her gaiety
and wit were inexhaustible. The revolu∣tion
dissolved Madame de—'s coteries,
<PB N="301" REF="320"/>
dispersed her adorers, transformed Paris
into a new region, where the altars of plea∣sure
were overthrown, where incense was
offered at the shrine of a new goddess, and
where Madame de—was stunned from
morning till night with the enthusiastic ac∣clamations
of the vulgar, whom she had
been accustomed to consider as only born for
slavery and silence; and who now, lifting
up their hoarse voices, for ever thundered
in her ear from every quarter the sounds of
liberty, and the rights of man.</P>
<P>The morning, after the first Federation,
disgusted with that spectacle of happiness,
and sickening at the recollection of those
shouts of exultation, which arose in unison
from half a million of assembled people,
Madame de—ordered post-horses, and
set out for London. Her chief solace in
that capital consisted in amusing her former
English acquaintances at Paris, by whom
<PB N="302" REF="321"/>
she was well received, with spiteful plea∣santries
upon the new order of things,
fanciful definitions of liberty, and ludicrous
sketches of the raw parti-coloured volun∣teers,
who, since Madame de—drew
their pictures, have scaled the Alps, and
changed the face of Europe.</P>
<P>While that lady was enlivening the vari∣ous
tea-tables where she visited, with well∣turned
epigrams on democracy, she was
summoned by her friends to hasten instantly
to France, in order to save her property
from confiscation, and herself from being
comprized in the law, which placed those
persons on the fatal list of emigrants, who
did not return within a stated time. Madame
de—, however, with full confidence in
her own powers of extricating herself from
all scrapes, and overcoming all obstacles,
loitered in London till the day of grace was
past. She at length came to Paris, and
<PB N="303" REF="322"/>
opened her career in that city, by playfully
jesting in society, even with persons in au∣thority,
on the subject of her emigration,
the events of the revolution, and her own
patriotic principles. But the bloody arena
of revolutionary government was at that
time prepared, the victims were already
marked, the horrid forms of death were
about to be let loose, and Madame de—'s
<HI>bons-mots,</HI> which were delightful in the
safe vicinity of Grosvenor-square, appeared
very nearly allied to madness in the neigh∣bourhood
of the square of the revolution:
as the flowering foliage of the light shrub,
which sports gracefully with the perfumed
zephyrs in the sheltered valley, assumes a
terrific character, when it waves over an
Alpine precipice. Madame de—find∣ing,
that under the fear of the guillotine,
people were entirely insensible to wit; and
at length being convinced, that all her
witcheries and enchantments would be lost
<PB N="304" REF="323"/>
upon the fierce demagogues who were about
to seize the reins of power, and that she was
even in some danger of the scaffold, set off
for Switzerland with a false passport, ac∣companied
by a young nobleman, who had
also procured one for the purpose of join∣ing
the army of Condé.</P>
<P>Madame de—had not succeeded in
saving her property from sequestration, and
her purse was but lightly furnished when
she left Paris; that of her fellow-traveller,
however, was well filled, and Madame de
—was rich in spells so potent, that for
her
<Q><L>“The royal banner, and all quality,</L>
<L>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war,”</L></Q>
were forgotten, till his purse became as
vacant as her own, and she then suffered
him to leave her at Bellinzone▪ and hasten
to the army with funds scarcely sufficient
<PB N="305" REF="324"/>
to pay the expences of his journey. During
this interregnum in Madame de—'s
conquests, Mons. C—, in evil hour,
arrived.</P>
<P>He was silent, dejected, and melancholy,
which little suited Madame de—'s
taste, but he was in possession of a large
sum of money, a circumstance which was
not ill adapted to the state of her finances.
Madame de—soon transformed herself
into a
<Q><L>“Pensive nun, devout and pure,</L>
<L>Sober, stedfast, and demure.”</L></Q></P>
<P>It was a considerable time before her ar∣tillery
of wiles made any impression on
Mons. C—; her pride became piqued,
as well as her interest engaged, in atchieving
this new conquest; and Mons. C—, after
a siege of considerable length, was added to
the number of her captives.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="325"/>
When her dominion was securely esta∣blished,
she insisted upon leaving the soli∣tudes
of Bellinzone, of which she had long
been heartily weary, for the more congenial
region of Constance, which, for dissipation
and pleasure, vied with the Paris of former
times; and where Mons. de C—'s purse
furnished her with all the means of volup∣tuous
luxury.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the unfortunate Ma∣dame
C—, heedless of the remonstrances
of her faithful Victoire, and indifferent to
the innocent prattle and sweet caresses of
her child, passed some weeks at Bellinzone
in that situation of mind, when every care,
every affection, and every thought, are ab∣sorbed
in one deep, powerful, overwhelm∣ing
sentiment of misery. She was rouzed
from this inactive despondency by finding
herself menaced with an evil which she had
often pitied, but once had little chance of
<PB N="307" REF="326"/>
ever feeling; this evil was poverty; not
that figurative poverty which pines in arti∣ficial
want, but the last terrible extreme of
real misery; misery which weighs with its
deepest pressure on a mother's heart, when
she hears the complaining voice of her
child, and has no power to supply its neces∣sities.
Madame C—had left France
with a sum of money little more than suf∣ficient
to defray the expences of her jour∣ney;
but she felt no anxiety on this ac∣count,
as she was going to join her husband,
who she knew was provided, at his depar∣ture,
with funds which must still be more
than sufficient to supply all present exigen∣cies;
and for the future she looked forward
to the efforts of their friend in France, to
rescue something from the wreck of their
property.</P>
<P>Since her arrival at Bellinzone, she had
thought little on the subject, for amidst the
<PB N="308" REF="327"/>
first sharp pangs of wounded affection, the
lacerated heart, only awake to one sensation,
turns with disgust from all the cares, the
anxieties, and views of ordinary life; the
world seems one wide cheerless desart, and
all that it contains, except the object we
have lost, has no power to excite an emo∣tion
of pain or pleasure.</P>
<P>From this lethargy of despair Madame
C—was awakened, by Victoire telling
her that she had heard that the inn at which
they lived was extremely expensive. She
immediately sent for her bill, though with∣out
much alarm, since her repasts had, she
thought, been too simple to be costly. The
amount of the bill, however, so far exceed∣ed
her expectation, that when it was paid,
a few remaining livres and a few trinkets
were the sole property she possessed. Ma∣dame
C—looked at her child, and felt
that she had no moments to lose; she de∣termined
<PB N="309" REF="328"/>
to leave the inn immediately, and
Victoire, after some research, hired a small
chamber, containing too wretched beds, to
which she retired. here Madame C—,
who had her whole life been nursed in the
bosom of affluence, scarcely allowing her∣self
the scanty sustenance which nature re∣quires
for its preservation, bathed her child
with tears of bitterness, till sometimes the
infant caught the infectious sorrow, and
wept because he saw her weep. Sometimes
he inquired why his mama had no dinner;
and sometimes asked why, since he was a
good boy, she gave him no <HI>bons-bons</HI> now?
Victoire chearfully shared her lady's dry
crust, and the only point on which they
differed was, that she occasionally gave vent
to a sharp reflection on her master, which
Madame C—instantly repressed; upon
which Victoire usually left the room, and
indulged her feelings, as well as her loqua∣city,
<PB N="310" REF="329"/>
by relating the story, in terms little
measured, to the whole neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Madame C—perceived with anguish,
which can be ill defined, that, notwithstand∣ing
all the privations maternal tenderness
could devise or practise, her little funds
were almost entirely exhausted; and she had
now recourse to her watch and rings, as the
last means of averting want from her
child. Victoire was forced to part with
these relicks of former splendor at a price
far below their value: alas! in such sort of
conventions there is usually an unequal con∣flict
between rapacity and distress; but at
that period the same sad necessity had forced
so many unfortunate fugitives to relinquish,
like Madame C—, the appendages of de∣parted
opulence, that the quantity of jewel▪
trinkets, and watches, offered for sale in
Switzerland, had naturally diminished their
worth.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330"/>
With a trembling hand Madame C—
received the produce of her last resources,
while she anticipated the moment, when
they would altogether fail. The people of
the town, where she had alighted, had be∣fore
her arrival, dispatched the letter to
Mons. C—, which she had sent him
from Basil, but she had received no tidings
of him in return; it was therefore evident,
that he was unaffected by her situation, that
he was careless of her fate, that he thought
of her no more! Amidst the bitterness of
of those reflections, how eagerly would she
have welcomed that death to which he
abandoned her, but that she must leave her
child to perish. She had not neglected to
inform her friend in France of her circum∣stances;
but her letter, which it was death
to receive, had to travel by a route so cir∣cuitous,
and to pass through so many hands
before it reached him, that nothing could
be more uncertain than its arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="331"/>
With a frame languid from suffering,
and a heart desolate with despair, Madame
C—was one evening sitting in her
wretched shed, lost in gloomy meditation,
when Victoire, who had been out in search
of their little daily supplies, hastily entered
the room, and told her, that having been to
pay a visit to the people of the inn, where
they had lodged, and where she had been
talking of her lady's misfortunes, a person
who was present said, that if Madame
could embroider waistcoats, work cra∣vats,
or draw landscapes, she would un∣dertake
to sell them to the mistress of the
principal inn at Sursee, who made it her
business to dispose of such little sort of
works, which were executed by some emi∣grant
ladies who lived in that town; and
she was sure the same benevolent person
would do as much for Madame, when she
knew her story.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="332"/>
Victoire had proceeded thus far, when
Madame C—threw herself on her knees,
and poured forth a servent thanksgiving: she
then folded her little boy to her bosom, and
instantly dispatched Victoire to make known
how thankfully she accepted this blessed
offer. Early the next morning the necessary
materials were purchased, and Madame
C—, with eager alacrity, began her task.
While she contemplated the first elegant
performance, which advanced rapidly be∣neath
her creating hand, tears of soothing
pleasure, tears which it was luxury to shed,
gushed from her eyes. To have the power
of applying those accomplishments, which
she had only cultivated as the amusement of
a solitary hour, to the dear, the precious
purpose of sustaining her child, filled her
mind with the sweetest sensations of mater∣nal
tenderness—it was delight, elevated by
the noble consciousness of duty—it was an
effort of virtue, which, while it shielded
<PB N="314" REF="333"/>
the object of her fond solicitude from suf∣fering,
was interwoven with an immediate
recompense in the soothing effect it pro∣duced
on her own mind. Since, amidst con∣tinual
occupation, that gloomy desondency,
which in stillness and solitude brooded over
its own turbulent wretchedness, was soft∣ened
into milder sorrow, and engrossed by
the unceasing care of providing for her
child, the image of its father, which used to
call forth the wild agonies of disappointed
passion, but now awakened a tender melan∣choly,
which resignation tempered. The
only moments which Madame C—gave
to leisure, and the indulgence of her feel∣ings,
were those of twilight, when, after
the unremitting labours of the long sum∣mer
day, she usually left her little boy to
the care of Victoire, and walking out alone
amidst those scenes of solemn grandeur, in∣dulged
that mournful musing, when the
mind wanders ever its vanished pleasures,
<PB N="315" REF="334"/>
and tears, which flow without controul,
embalm the past!</P>
<P>In one of those solitary walks, seated on
the fragment of a rock, near the torrent∣stream,
the hoarse noise of whose melan∣choly
waters were congenial to her medita∣tions,
the chain of pensive thought was sud∣denly
broken by the tread of an approaching
footstep. She cast up her eyes, and be∣held
Mons. C—, who, pale, and tremb∣ling
with emotion, threw himself at her feet,
clasped her knees in unutterable agony, and
at length told her in broken accents, that he
came not to solicit her forgiveness, but to
die in her presence—that feeling he had but
a short time to live, he had ventured to be∣hold
her once more, not to attempt any ex∣tenuation
of his guilt, or to declare how
much he abhorred himself for the past, but
merely to explain the appearance of that
<PB N="316" REF="335"/>
barbarous neglect, in which she had been
left at Bellinzone.</P>
<P>Mons. C—then, after execrating the
delusion, by which he had been so fatally
misled, related, that having taken an excur∣sion
into Germany, at the period when her
letter arrived, he had only received it two
months after it was dated. Rouzed as from
an hideous dream, seized with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pangs
of remorse at his own conduct, and feeling
every sentiment of renewed tenderness awa∣kened
in his heart by the image of her
sufferings, he instantly declared to Madame
—his resolution to hasten to Bellinzone.
No intelligence, he perceived, could be
more agreeable to that lady, and not long
after he discovered the reason, by hearing
that she was gone to Vienna with a Ger∣man
Count, the owner of a brilliant equi∣page,
with whom she became acquainted
<PB N="317" REF="336"/>
during their excursion, and who had fol∣lowed
her to Constance. Mons. C—
added, that having himself set out on foot
from that city, being determined not to
spend on the indulgence of a carriage the
few louis he had yet in reserve, the violent
emotions of his mind, joined to excessive
fatigue of body, by taking journeys too
rapid, in order to accelerate his arrival, pro∣duced
a dangerous fever. At a little vil∣lage-inn,
where he lay for several weeks
stretched upon a solitary bed of sickness, he
had perhaps, he said, in some measure
atoned for the past, by the bitterness of his
regrets, by that anguish—he was proceed∣ing,
when Madame C—threw herself
upon his neck, bathed his bosom with her
tears, conjured him for ever to forget the
past, and declared, that her sufferings had
already vanished in the hope of his return∣ing
affection.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="337"/>
When Madame C—, with soft per∣suasion,
had somewhat reconciled her hus∣band
to himself, and a calm confidential
conversation had succeeded the tumultuous
emotions of their first meeting, they bent
their way to the little apartment which was
now their sole habitation, and which he had
not yet entered; since having learned from
the people of the house, in Victoire's ab∣sence,
which path Madame C—had
taken for her evening walk, he had instantly
hastened to the spot. They had scarcely
reached the chamber, when his little boy
sprung forward to meet him, clung upon
his neck, called him his dear, dear papa,
and reiterated his caresses till Mons. C—,
overcome with faintness, agitation, and fa∣tigue,
sunk senseless on a chair. Madame
C—wept at observing his emaciated
figure, and his pale and haggard look; and
Victoire, she perceived, tried to squeeze out
a tear too, but not succeeding, all she could
<PB N="319" REF="338"/>
do was to wipe her eyes carefully with her
handkerchief. Victoire was probably think∣ing
more of the dry crusts on which she
had dined occasionally, and which sort of
repasts she attributed to her master's con∣duct,
than of his sickly countenance. Ma∣dame
C—found nothing more difficult
than to restrain Victoire's loquacity, who
contrived, whenever she had an opportu∣nity
in the course of the evening, to relate
the hardships they had suffered with a spite∣ful
minuteness of detail—how Madame
breakfasted upon cold water instead of cof∣fee,
and dined sometimes upon lentil-soup,
and sometimes not at all; and how she
gained two livres a-day by drawing and em∣broidery.</P>
<P>This last intelligence was more than
Mons. C—could bear; he hid his face
with his hands, sprung from his chair, and
walked in a disordered manner up and
<PB N="320" REF="339"/>
down the room. Madame angrily imposed
silence on Victoire, who, taking the hint,
declared that she was <HI>au desespoir</HI> at having
afflicted Monsieur, for whom she felt the
most profound respect, and then left the
room, in order, probably, to talk over his
transgressions to the whole neighbourhood.
She staid so long, that Madame C—was
forced to go in search of her, and as she
approached, heard her saying, “to be sure
I don't forget that Monsieur is a <HI>cordon
rouge</HI> after all, and therefore not made to
give an account of his actions to any body;
but then when I think of my dear lady”—
here Victoire was interrupted in her unfi∣nished
speech.</P>
<P>Monsieur had a return of his fever,
which lasted some weeks; and, at
length, believing he had suffered suffi∣cient
penance, Victoire graciously ac∣corded
him her forgiveness. A short time
<PB N="321" REF="340"/>
after, the return of Mons. C—, a letter
arrived from their friend in France, with
tidings that he had secured for Madame
C—a sum sufficient to produce a little
revenue, which would place her out of the
reach of want, and which sum was depo∣sited
in the hands of a Swiss banker. Upon
receiving this intelligence, they determined
to leave their wretched apartment, and hav∣ing,
in their rambles along the wild valley
leading to the Grisons, discovered a neat
vacant cottage, they hired it for the sum∣mer;
there Mons. C—hoped to recover
his health amidst the salubrious breezes
from the hills, and his peace of mind amidst
the calm and soothing sensations which the
simple beauties of unadorned nature can best
excite.</P>
<P>After repeated visits to her charming cot∣tage,
I bade Madame C—a long, re∣luctant
farewell; and have since heard,
<PB N="322" REF="341"/>
with delight, that she continues in the pri∣vacy
of her retreat to enjoy that domestic
bliss, which, to sensibility like hers, is the
first of blessings, she has a mind capable of
relinquishing rank and splendor without a
sigh, since she has found happiness in ex∣change.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Visit to the Grisons.—Discussion on the Revolution.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of our rides near Bellinzone, we
made an excursion along a valley belonging
to the Grisons. Fatigued with the beams of
the noon day sun, we looked around for the
inn of the village, and accepted the invita∣tion
of a person, of whom we made the
inquiry, and over whose door we saw an
inscription that denoted the asylum, of
which we were in search. The hour of
dinner was past in the valley, but a plenti∣ful
collation of fruits, wine, and cakes,
were set before us. On our entrance we
found three or four persons in warm poli∣tical
debate; but the principal disputants
were a gentleman of Turin, who had lately
passed some time at Paris, and a young ec∣clesiastic
<PB N="324" REF="343"/>
belonging to an adjoining village.
As the subject of dispute was the revolution
which had just then taken place in the Gri∣sons,
we were led to ask for information
respecting it.</P>
<P>The native of Turin informed us, that
that event was nothing but the transitory
commotion of an ignorant and tumultuous
mob, that on some idle pretence had as∣sembled
together to correct abuses that did
not exist, had seized on the government of
the country, committed great depredations
on the property of individuals, and were on
the point of being reduced to their primi∣tive
nothingness, as the good sense of the
country revolted against proceedings so des∣tructive
of peace and order. The ecclesiastic
listened with considerable impatience to the
end of the harangue, when, with an elo∣quent
volubility, that proved how ear∣nestly
his heart was engaged in the cause,
<PB N="325" REF="344"/>
he ran over the long list of tyrannies exer∣cised
on the people by the Aristocratic go∣vernments,
which had just been overthrown.
He attested that this tumultuous rabble was
a regular assembly of the representatives of
the people deputed from each commune,
and who had met as a legal convention to re∣form
in the most constitutional manner
those abuses. He assured us, that so far
from committing depredations on property,
perhaps the only blame to be cast on the
convention, was the lenity with which they
had treated those offences, which had ne∣cessitated
the change of government, since
all they had done was to order a repayment
into the public treasury from each defaulter
of the unaccounted monies; but this was
exacted in such small proportions, that the
sentence seemed rather an invitation to of∣fence
than a punishment for past depreda∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="345"/>
The reforms in the future administration,
he asserted, were not less mild than the
lenity exercised against the abuses of the
past. The people were relieved from the
burden of taxes that were never applied by
their former governors to the service of the
state, and the feudal rights of the nobility
were abolished; that with the exception of
the slight retributions made to the public
purse, and the loss of certain privileges, by
more equality in the regulations of com∣merce,
the nobles had nothing to lament,
but a degree of influence, which they ought
never to have possessed, and were even per∣mitted
to retain all the insignia of their an∣cient
dominion, all the decorations of fa∣mily
and title. So far, continued our eccle∣siastic,
was this assembly of the people from
being reduced to what was called primitive
nothingness, that having only before them
certain simple objects of reform, in which
they were unanimous, they had adjourned
<PB N="327" REF="346"/>
their meeting, merely because they had
finished their work; and so far were they
from having acted contrary to the wish of
their constituents, that he believed, except
from those who were immediately interest∣ed
in the continuance of ancient abuses,
there was but one voice throughout the
whole country, that of enthusiasm for the
recovery of their rights, which, if again at∣tacked,
all were ready to defend, or perish
in the attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears that this young ecclesiastic had formed too favourable an opinion of his new governors on the other side of the mountain; and it is probable, that he and the other inhabitants of the Valley of Misox have since changed their manner of thinking: since it is said, that the people of this valley, now the only part of the Grison dominions on the southern side of the Alps, have solicited their junction to the Cisalpine re∣public; between which two countries are situated the Italian bailiwicks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The reply of the Piedmontese to his an∣tagonist
<PB N="328" REF="347"/>
was witty and sarcastic; but it was
easy to perceive, by the triumph painted in
the countenances of the by-standers, that
the priest had echoed their own sentiments.
Our inn-keeper joined in the conversation,
with an authority equal to his guests; but
though deeply interested in the debate, was
careful to go at certain intervals with a
spoonful of lemonade to wet the parched
lips of a feverish infant, who lay in its
cradle in a corner of the room. Its sister, a
girl of six years of age, drest in a blue bod∣dice,
and short red petticoat, with her feet
and legs bare, and whose cheek flushed with
the clearest bloom of health, and eye spark∣ing
with sprightliness, formed a striking
contrast to the languid look of the pale
baby, stood patiently at the side of its
cradle, with a large vine-branch in her
hand, which she waved backwards and for∣wards
to prevent the numerous flies, that
noon brings forth in that country, from
<PB N="329" REF="348"/>
teizing the sick child. There was some∣thing
so attractive in this domestic groupe,
that they often made me forget the Grison
revolution.</P>
<P>Two hours had glided away before we
thought of ordering our horses, when we
received a most cordial invitation from a
venerable old man of the party, to pass a
few days at his dwelling, in our passage
over his mountains, having heard that we
proposed returning through the Grison
country.</P>
<P>We were not a little embarrassed at the
mistake we had made, when upon inquir∣ing
what expence we had incurred, our
host replied, that the only recompense he
desired was our speedy return at an earlier
hour to dinner: when we should be re∣ceived,
not as he saw we supposed our∣selves
at an inn, but at the habitation of
<PB N="330" REF="349"/>
a friend, who would be thankful for the
favour. Our inn-keeper proved, on in∣quiry,
to be the principal magistrate of the
district, and the inscription, which we had
taken for a sign, was an ornament over the
door of his house.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Val Calenca State of Society.—Journey up St. Bernar∣din.
—Lavanges.—Grison Hospitality.—Pastoral Oc∣cupations.</HEAD>
<P>WE did not fail, on leaving the Italian
vallies, to pass two days with our hospita∣ble
host, the greater part of which were
spent in excursions amongst the mountains,
particularly those of the Val Calenca, which
is one of the four districts of this jurisdic∣tion,
called the high jurisdiction of the
Valley of Misox. A rapid torrent flowing
from the Glaciers of the Bird Mountain,
runs noisily through the Valley of Valenca,
and throws itself into the Moesa. We pas∣sed
through several villages, but stopped to
repose ourselves at Santa Maria, the capital
of the Valley, where we saw a magnificent
<PB N="332" REF="351"/>
church dedicated to the Virgin. The last
village in this district, or the nearest to the
Glaciers, is Val Bella, or the Beautiful Val∣ley;
but as we were assured that the place
did not at all correspond with the name, we
discontinued our journey thither. This
valley, situated between the mountains of
Val Bienna and those of the Valley of Mi∣sox,
is extensive, but for the most part wild
and barren; it is not easy to find a place in
the world so little known to it, as this se∣cluded
and savage nook. The ungrateful
soil prompts the inhabitants to periodical
emigrations; the summer is spent in the
native hut, and the winter is the season of
travel and observation, the expences of
which are defrayed by the produce of their
manufactures, such as baskets, pitch, grind∣ing-stones,
and other territorial mountain∣ous
productions, which they fell in Italy.
Those who are not engaged in commercial
projects, and the wives and children of
<PB N="333" REF="352"/>
those who are, follow other speculations of
profit, among which are those of begging
and predicting the <HI>buona aventura,</HI> or tel∣ting
fortunes.</P>
<P>After taking leave of our kind host, we
proceeded on our journey along the Valley
of Misox towards the Bernardin moun∣tains.
This valley is one of the four high
jurisdictions below the woods, into which
the Grison league is divided. The ancient
inhabitants are known in history under the
general term of the Lepontii, but their de∣scendants
were successively subject to the
Bishop of Como, the Counts of Saxe, and
the family of the Trivulci. In the middle
of the sixteenth century, the inhabitants
purchased their freedom of this family for
twenty-five thousand florins, and joined
themselves to the Grison league, who have
maintained the confederacy, notwithstanding
the various attempts which have been
<PB N="334" REF="353"/>
since made to deprive them of their li∣berty.</P>
<P>The road, for several miles, is perfectly
level along the Moesa, and the valley suffi∣ciently
extensive to admit of fine cultiva∣tion,
contains a number of handsome vil∣lages;
but after passing the confluence of
this stream with the torrent of Calenca, the
valley becomes so narrow as to admit little
more space between the mountains than for
the path and the river. Here we were once
more among rocks, torrents, and cliffs load∣ed
with woods, presenting not only parts of
the mountain scenery, to which we were
now accustomed, but from the great depth of
the valley closed in by surrounding moun∣tains,
casting a kind of gloomy light over the
wild landscape, that strongly excited in the
mind that sensation of melancholy which
Pope has characterised,
<Q>“Breathing a browner horror o'er the woods.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="354"/>
Before we came to the end of this lower
valley, where the mountain, direct in front,
lofty and abrupt, seemed to preclude all
possibility of proceeding, we passed for a
considerable way over a road entirely broken
up, and which displayed the roots of
larches, pines, and other mountain trees,
mingled with vast mounds of gravelly
stones and masses of rock. This desolation
had been caused by a deluge from the up∣per
mountains, on the sudden melting of
the snows in the spring from an incessant
rain, which lasted several days, accompa∣nied
by gusts of warm winds, like the Si∣rocco
of Italy. The openings into the
ravines of the mountains where the snow
had drifted, and from its mass had resisted
the influence of the heat which melted the
thinner layers, served as sluice-gates to the
sea of waters which they ingulphed. The
increasing weight of those waters from the
melting of the snows above, together with
<PB N="336" REF="355"/>
the decrease in the resisting mass beneath,
from the heat and the rain, prepared at
length the catastrophe, by the giving way
of the icy barrier.</P>
<P>Language can but feebly paint the sub∣lime
and terrific effects of this deluge of the
mountainous sea. Had our poet, Thomson,
beheld this mighty devastation, his glowing
imagination would have presented us with
far other images than those of
<Q><L>“Herds and flocks, and travellers and swains,</L>
<L>And sometimes whole brigades of marching troops,</L>
<L>Or hamlets sleeping in the dread of night;”</L></Q>
the feeble works of human art and industry
hurled beneath the smothering ruins. He
would have viewed the lofty pine, the an∣cient
inhabitant of the Alps, whose roots
have been riveted for ages to the soil, swept
away, by the horrible flood, like the chaff;
the rocks, coeval with time, and which
<PB N="337" REF="356"/>
seemed fixed on the solid globe till time
shall be no longer, torn from their base
with irresistible fury, and rolled, in one wild
convulsive commotion, down the tremend∣ous
precipices, riving up the affrighted soil,
in their descent, and covering the fertile
pasturage and rich champain with irrepara∣ble
desolation.</P>
<P>A narrow pass cut out of a fantastic
rock, hanging over the Moesa, which forms
a bay in the plain, brought us to the foot
of this perpendicular mountain, down
whose dark wooded and shaggy precipices
we heard the torrent roaring, but which
their projecting sides concealed from our
view. We appeared to be inclosed between
inaccessible heights; there was no passage
discoverable like that of the cavern which
leads from the devil's bridge into the Valley
of Urseren, and it would have exercised the
imagination, to have built even an ideal road
<PB N="338" REF="357"/>
by which the ascent could be gained. The
mountaineers, however, had overcome the
difficulty; on that side of the mountain
which was the most sloping, or rather the
least perpendicular, a road was cut in tra∣verse
directions to the end of the slope,
whence it was returned in an angle, suffi∣ciently
broad to permit the ascent of cattle,
and so continued from one side to the other
supported by beams of wood, either for the
preservation of the way, or to keep the tra∣veller
from stumbling over the precipice,
till after laborious climbing it brings him
to the summit.</P>
<P>Like the passage into the Valley of Ur∣seren,
the plain on the top of this moun∣tain
presented us with scenes altogether dif∣ferent
from those which we had left beneath.
It is generally in the lower valleys, which
serve as canals or outlets to the mountains,
that we find those romantic and picturesque
<PB N="339" REF="358"/>
objects, on which we gaze with delight
and astonishment. In the upper moun∣tains,
nature has cast off the fantastic and
varied garb of rock, and cliff, and torrent,
for a robe more simple and majestic; the
scene takes a larger sweep, the forest is
more extensive, and the hills swell with a
more noble grace one above the other.</P>
<P>So few are the travellers who pass this
mountain, the principal passages across the
Alps being those of St. Gothard and Splugen,
that the visit of strangers is an event of
some importance. On our approach to a
village embosomed in trees, forming the
middle point of an amphitheatre of a beau∣tiful
range of hills, covered with the freshest
verdure, we discovered our venerable friend
walking hastily towards us, with a pretty
little mountain nymph, his grand-daughter,
in one hand, and a large oaken staff in the
other, which he shook at us with a smile
<PB N="340" REF="359"/>
of reproach, declaring that he had waited
dinner three hours beyond his usual time,
having had news of us early in the morn∣ing,
and that he could not imagine why
we had loitered so long on the way. We
found a plentiful repast prepared for us,
consisting of beasts and birds of the forest,
and were informed that we should not be
suffered to depart till the provision was ex∣pended,
which the hunting of the two pre∣ceding
days had furnished.</P>
<P>The old man's family consisted of a
daughter and her two children, the one a
youth of twenty, and the other the pretty
little mountaineer of sixteen years of age,
who had come with her grandfather to meet
us; his son-in-law, who was then gone on
some affairs to Chiavenna, was expected
home before our departure. We spent the
remainder of the day in walking among
these romantic and pastoral scenes, and the
<PB N="341" REF="360"/>
next we made a family party up the moun∣tain,
to dine in one of his shepherd's huts▪
by the side of a fine cascade, which, having
found out my enthusiasm for such objects,
he told me he was sure I should find worth
the toil of the visit. The torrent formed
part of a beautiful landscape, and played in
successive cataracts over rocks that were
picturesque; but we had seen too much of
the Reuss and the Tessino, to find in these
falling waters any new charm, except that
they were inclosed by green banks instead
of shaggy rocks.</P>
<P>These hills appeared, from their verdure,
to be in the highest state of mountainous
cultivation. The spot was not so elevated as
to be out of the reach of the parching sun∣beam,
and little channels cut along the side
of the slopes, drew the water away from the
idle torrent to fertilize the adjoining pas∣tures.
On the greater part of these hills
<PB N="342" REF="361"/>
the hay had already been cut. Some yet
lay on the ground, which, from the moun∣tain
flowers and herbs, scented the air with
the most delicious fragrance. While these
hills are laid up for harvest, the shepherd
removes to the Upper Alps, ascending with
his cattle to crop the herbage of those
higher hills, as they are successively de∣prived
of their snows. Here he spends
a solitary and cheerless life through the
short summer, and returns in the autumn
to the huts in the lower vallies, where
he remains shut up with his cattle to con∣sume
the provision which he has prepared
for winter. The life of the shepherd of the
Alps is very different from that of the shep∣herd
of Arcadia; but from the little inter∣course
which he holds with any society
whatever, except the beasts which he feeds,
his wants are only those of nature, and con∣sequently
few: the intemperance of the
season finds him prepared to meet it without
<PB N="343" REF="362"/>
shrinking, and the winter storm flies harm∣less
over his head, whose physical feelings
are hardened to the icy temperature of his
mountains, and who is accustomed to
<Q>“Breast the keen air, and carol as he goes.”</Q>
Sometimes indeed the patience of the shep∣herd
expires before the winter, when he
perceives, which sometimes happens, that
his stock decays faster than the summer
approaches.</P>
<P>These pasturages are not sufficiently steep
for avalanches, but higher up the moun∣tain,
partial mischiefs are occasioned by
their descent; and sometimes shepherds,
huts, and cattle, are lost for a while under
immense drifts of snow, which the impetu∣ous
winds have sent in that direction. It
was difficult for us, the inhabitants of the
lower world, to conceive that the change of
<PB N="344" REF="363"/>
seasons could make so barren and cheerless
a desart of so beautiful and fertile a country,
as that which we beheld, seated at our rural
repast before the shepherd's door; around
which the cattle were browzing, or lay
basking in the noon-tide sun-beam. That
the summer might be passed agreeably
amidst these mountains, we could easily be∣lieve;
for surely there are few spots on the
globe, that can boast a more boundless store
<Q><L>“Of charms, which nature to her vot'ry yields;</L>
<L>The warbling woodland, and the torrent's roar,</L>
<L>The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;</L>
<L>All that the genial ray of morning gilds,</L>
<L>And all that echoes to the song of even;</L>
<L>All that the mountain's shelt'ring bosom shields,</L>
<L>And all the dread magnificence of heaven;”</L></Q>
But the winter must indeed be gloomily
desolate to those, who, above the class of
the peasant, and having no taste for litera∣ture,
are immured in these insulated regions,
<PB N="345" REF="364"/>
which at that season become altogether im∣passable.</P>
<P>My pretty little companion answered my
questions, respecting her winter occupa∣tions,
by telling me, that she had returned
from school at Bellinzone the summer be∣fore,
and had employed the last winter in
spinning and making her grandfather a
large quantity of shirts, had worked a
flowered gown for herself, and read half of
an abridgment of Guicciardini's History of
the Wars of Italy, and two or three
volumes of Goldoni's Plays.</P>
<P>We bade adieu, with reluctance, to our
patriarchal host: I could have loitered
with pleasure yet a little longer in his
hospitable dwelling. How soothing was
this scene of tranquil pleasure—how de∣lightful
a transition from the crimes of
ferocious tyranny were the pastoral occupa∣tions
<PB N="346" REF="365"/>
and guiltless manners of those Alpine
regions! At a village, a few miles further
up the mountain, where the whole family
conducted us, we passed one more social
hour at breakfast, and then finally taking
leave of them, impressed with the most
agreeable recollection of their simple kind∣ness,
we began to climb the stupendous
summits of their mountains, the haunts of
eternal winter.</P>

Priest.—Summit of St. Bernardin.—First
View of the Rhine.</HEAD>
<P>THE Alps, which we traversed in our
ascent, wear, with little variation, the same
smiling aspect as in the regions below.
When the mountaineers speak of the Alps,
they do not mean those long chains of icy
or barren mountains, to which we give that
appellation, and which, in our language,
implies height. In the mountain dialect
that term conveys the idea of fertility; and
when the inhabitants talk of the Alps,
they always mean spots of mountain pastur∣age.
The <HI>Gletscher,</HI> the <HI>Horn,</HI> the <HI>Stork,</HI>
are denominations, by which they distin∣guish
different parts of these mountains,
<PB N="348" REF="367"/>
and the terms of rocky or ice-covered Alps,
would to them be unintelligible.</P>
<P>Having climbed to the village of St. Ber∣nardin,
and finding ourselves within the
influence of the Glaciers, which we saw
stretching far before us, we concluded, that
we had nearly reached the summit, but
learnt that we had yet a league of very
rough ascent to pass over before we should
begin to descend on the other side. We
made a halt at the village of St. Bernardin,
if two or three houses, one of which is an
inn, and a little building, dignified by the
name of a chapel, can be called a village.
The country around wears a cheerless, soli∣tary
aspect. We were not got beyond the
reach of vegetation; but it was a vegetation
that made the barrenness of the soil more
visible. The inhabitant of the Lower Alps
shares no property in this sterile region:
the wandering shepherd of the plains alone
<PB N="349" REF="368"/>
steals the winged days of summer, to lead
over an unappropriated soil his ragged and
ill-favoured flock. His miserable hut is
composed of pieces of rock, through the cran∣nies
of which the wind and the rain pour
without resistance. His chief and almost
unvaried food is oatmeal and water; for
the soil would reward no cultivation: bread
is the produce only of climates far below;
he is bereaved even of the most common
enjoyments of social life.</P>
<P>In these regions, however, we found
one inhabitant of polished manners, and let∣tered
accomplishments. A banished vicar
general of one of the principal dioceses of
France was dragging on existence amidst
these inhospitable climes, barred from all
communication with the world during the
long winter, and supported by the miserable
endowment of the chapel, amounting to six
or seven louis a year, and the coarse charity
<PB N="350" REF="369"/>
of the rude mountaineers, who were his
sole associates. He told us, that his bre∣viary,
his bible, and his Ovid, were his
only solace; that from the one he endea∣voured
to teach himself resignation to the
will of heaven, and from the other to sooth
his mind, by sympathizing with an exiled
fellow sufferer, who, banished from the
delights of a court to the desarts of Scy∣thia,
could scarcely have found them more
dreary than the summit of St. Bernardin.
Here also he might have exclaimed with
the poet:
<Q><L>“Forced from my native seats, and sacred home,</L>
<L>Friendless, alone, through Scythian wilds to roam;</L>
<L>With trembling knees o'er unknown hills I go,</L>
<L>Stiff with blue ice and heap'd with drifted snow;</L>
<L>Pale suns there strike their feeble rays in vain,</L>
<L>Which faintly glance against the marble plain.”</L>
<BIBL>Mrs. BARBAULD.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="370"/>
He had been vaguely informed of the fall
of Robespierre, and the return of a milder
system; and he inquired with such solici∣tude
if there was no hope of his being
permitted to revisit his country, that it
would have been cruel to rob his sorrows
of that fond illusion. We left this unfor∣tunate
stranger with sincere regret, that we
had no power to extricate him from a situa∣tion
which seemed almost insupportable.</P>
<P>We now began to scale the remainder of
the mountain, and though we felt the icy
breeze from the neighbouring Glaciers, we
escaped any disagreeable sensations of cold
by the frequent exercise of walking, the
road being often too steep or too dangerous
to continue or horseback. We also enjoyed
the rays of a cloudless sun, more brilliant,
indeed, than genial, from the extreme rare∣faction
of the atmosphere at this elevation.
We had been told at Bellinzone that the
<PB N="352" REF="371"/>
mountain, for two leagues, is always co∣vered
with a considerable quantity of snow,
but without having passed any, we attained
the summit.</P>
<P>The top of St. Bernardin affords nothing
that is striking, except its desolate unifor∣mity;
here are no masses of enormous rock,
no tremendous precipices, no yawning
chasms; no object picturesque or awe∣ful.
The storms of ages have not only
stript it of the means of vegetation, by
washing away every vestige of soil, but
have humbled the rocks, if any once stood
prominent, to a modest level with the waste.
The mountain still rising on the right, con∣ceals
the Glaciers that separate the Grisons
from the Valt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line, but on the left the eye
wanders far over those regions of eternal
frost, which are formed by the eastern ex∣tremity
of that chain of mountains, known
to the antients under the name of the Adula.
<PB N="353" REF="372"/>
In the front the view extends across the
valley of the Rhine, to the Glaciers that
separate it from the other vallies of the
Grisons. We seemed within reach of those
Glaciers which we beheld falling, like an
immense veil, down the mountain below
our present elevation, and were eager to
tread their glossy surface; but were told
that a passage across from St. Bernardin was
impracticable.</P>
<P>After reposing ourselves on the summit,
amidst this chaos of unvivified nature, we
began to descend on the northern side. The
mountains we had just scaled were so
abruptly thrown back, that we could dis∣cern
no farther in a direct line before us,
than the hill which we were immediately
ascending, and often believed we had at∣tained
the summit before we had conquered
half the road. On the other side we were
presented with a majestic sweep down the
<PB N="354" REF="373"/>
mountain, and along the lofty hills that in∣close
the valley of the Rhine, stretching
away to the piny forests rising above the
Vale of Splugen. After descending a con∣siderable
way almost perpendicularly, but
on a firm and well-constructed road, we
came in view of that celebrated river which
we had lately beheld bearing its thundering
mass of waters to the ocean, but which,
now just springing from its source, steals
placidly along the quiet valley, soft as the
first sleep of infancy after it has waked to
new existence.</P>
