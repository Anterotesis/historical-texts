<HEAD>To the Honourable

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS very natural for Persons who attempt
things of this Nature, to lay hold on the
smallest Occasion to claim the Protection of the
Generous and Just. I have heard you commend
<HI>Spanish</HI> Stories, and having ventur'd upon one, pre∣sume
to offer it at your Feet. It is almost im∣possible
for a Man of your Goodness and Chara∣cter,
to escape Addresses of this kind; for as the
Sower and Morose despise the Muse, so she always
flies them, a Clime too rough and tempestuous for
her tender Pinions; but with Pleasure aspires to
the Brave: And who more truly deserves that Epi∣thet,
than Sr. <HI>Jacob Banks?</HI></P>
<P>One, who tho' not born a Native of <HI>England,</HI>
yet, by his Zeal for the Glory of the Best of
Queens, and constant Assertion for the Nation's
Cause has Justly made this Country his own,
unshaken to his Friend, and delighting to do
kind Offices to all. I am entred upon a Theme
which did I follow my Inclinations, I should
not easily quit; but sometimes even Truth of∣fends
<PB REF="3"/>
in so nice a Point as Praise; and Persons of
Merit with less Pain <HI>Do</HI> great Actions, than hear
of them. That you may still possess all Happi∣ness,
and long enjoy those Pledges of your Love
left you by a Beauteous Wife, for whose Memory
you retain such a Veneration and Tenderness,
scarce to be met with in your Sex; that these,
and all other Blessings may continually attend you,
is the daily Wish of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Your most Humble,
and most Obedient Servant,</CLOSER>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoke by Mr. Booth.</BYLINE>
<L>TO hit your Tast we've try'd a thousand Ways</L>
<L>Pastorals, Opera's, and some good Plays:</L>
<L>A House was built, the Lord knows what the Charge,</L>
<L>We find indeed the Structure proves too large;</L>
<L>That, nor the Season, stops our Diligence,</L>
<L>We still play on, tho' at our own Expence.</L>
<L>And like some Miser who has done his Best,</L>
<L>To furnish out one various Splendid Feast,</L>
<L>To little Trifles he at last descends,</L>
<L>And with whipt Cream and Froth Regales his Friends;</L>
<L>So we in Farce a Summer Present bring,</L>
<L>For once accept the humble Offering.</L>
<L>Good Humour sure, must reign in every Breast,</L>
<L>Whilst thus with Victory our Arms are blest?</L>
<L>Whilst—</L>
<L>In the Field the <HI>British</HI> Trumpets sound,</L>
<L>And each returning Year is with new Conquests Crown'd,</L>
<L><HI>Lewis</HI> grown Old in Falshood and Design,</L>
<L>Where Valour fail'd, supply'd his Force with Coin.</L>
<L>But our Great Chief upon the open Plain,</L>
<L>The Cause of injur'd Nations does maintain;</L>
<L>Snatches the Guilty Laurels <HI>France</HI> has worn,</L>
<L>Which justly now the Conqueror's Line adorn;</L>
<L>Who, like another <HI>Scipio</HI> leads us on,</L>
<L>And merits all the Wreaths the <HI>Romans</HI> Won.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>SAVE ye <HI>Don Bellmour</HI> as a Man may say, you are
Equipt I see <HI>a la Mode D'Espagne.</HI> What canst thou
mean by this—S'death I'd assoon change the
Habit of thy Sex and wear the Womens Furbe∣lows
as these Dam'd Golilia's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold what a pair of Spectacles my Rogue of a Tay∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
has brought me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sight of which I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great Passion
bid him look in my Face and guess <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> those Helps.
<HI>Don Thimble</HI> with the Gravity of a Corrigidore answer'd,
'twas a Proof of Manhood not of Age▪ and by the solemn
Oath of St. <HI>Sago,</HI> Swor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not a Hero of fourteen durst pre∣tend
to a piece of Gallantry without these Magnifying Glasses,
adorn'd his Nose and alter'd his Speech. (<HI>puts them on</HI>) Do
ye understand me Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay</SPEAKER>
<P>Rediculous—pr'ythee give them me; I'll carry
them for a Present to an Old Decay'd Beauty of my Acquain∣quaintance
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
in <HI>England,</HI> who always uses Spectacles when she
Patches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know who you mean e'en Transport her my
close Collar too; 'twill hide the Wrinkles of her Neck, for I
am sure it pinches mine intollerably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for Heaven's sake tell me the Reason? When my
Lord Ambassadour gives us our full Liberty, and Travailing
in his Train as Relations and Men that design only to see the
Country and not Inhabit in it; We I say, whose chief aim is
Pleasure? Why we should put our selves in pain with the
Formality of their incomprehensible Dress? Is indeed to me
unacountable Folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Gay-love,</HI> you mistake my End—'tis to promote
my Pleasure I have done it. I never yet Address'd a Woman
but I cou'd hear the <HI>Don</HI> say to his Servants beware the <HI>Eng∣lishman,</HI>
watch him close, use your Pistol if he proceeds—so
I resolve to Mimick their formal Gate, set Speech, and stiff
Behaviour, and try what Luck I shall meet with then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on and Prosper—for my part I have no rea∣son
to Complain of my Stars as I am—Not long ago I
pass'd the Night in the Arms of a melting Beauty, tho' her
Father lay Coughing over Head, and her snoring Brother in
the next Room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care <HI>Gay-love,</HI> some of these Women will be∣betray
thee, and thou wilt meet instead of an Embrace, a
Stab.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fear not—Dangers seldom face the Bold—Cowards
that fly them they often overtake—But hast
thou no particular Amour, no Belle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ione, for which thy
Ease is Sacrifis'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>To confess the Truth I have—there is a Woman
or rather an Angel, whose Eyes have power to animate the
Dead, she has all the Sweetness, Grace and Majesty, that
Nature ever yet bestow'd upon the Fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now must I brag of my Mistress, tho' I have sworn
to the contrary—nay, nay, hold ye Friend, I have a
Lady shall Shine with her for the best Jewel in the King of
<HI>Spains</HI> Coronet.</P>

her Guardian, ugly as a Monster, and his ill Nature, you
may read without my Spectacles, who like a cruel Cerberu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as he is, forbids all that approach, only by stol'n Glances from
her talking Eyes I fancy my self not disagreeable to her,
this is the occasion of my Habit, and for the same Reason
<HI>Jo</HI> is lac'd up to his Chin, and now gone to find me out—a
Man whom we must receive like a Grandee, but is indeed.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>a Pimp.—Hearke <HI>Bellmour,</HI> you shall lend him
me if he is Ingenious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell</SPEAKER>
<P>O a very <HI>Mercury</HI>—He is at your Service, I'll
share all my good Fortune with thee but my Mistress. Now
<HI>Gay-love,</HI> as I have dealt thus openly, I expect the same Free<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom,
and one Reason that makes me so inquisiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, I sea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from thy wild volatile Temper, thou wilt run into inevita∣ble
Danger, I find thee often absent and must know the Ad∣venture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Demand has so much kindness in it I cannot de∣ny
you—I have a particular Mistress too; whose Beau∣ty
I shall not enlarge upon, 'tis sufficient she Charms me, I
have often met her at St. <HI>Dominicks</HI> Chappel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thither my Mistress comes too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has more Wit in her Conversation than in my
Life I ever found in the Sex, but her Positive Command is
always Secrecy, should she know I told it but to thee, who
we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t thou Malicious, can do her nor me no harm in it, I dare
swear she would never forgive me; she cries Men of your
Country are such Blabs, and one step towards a Discovery
for ever loses her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not like so much Caution, I should fear some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not my Nature to suspect—besides I love
Intreagues that are not bare-fac'd, now here's Room for my
Fancy to work, I can suppose her a Princess, and fill my Head
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
with a Thousand pleasant Chimera's; Oh there's nothing so
Delightful as to have one's Mind full!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you neither know her Name nor where she Lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, all our Meetings are by her own Contrivance and
I am happy in obeying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I with you success, but pray be careful. How
do you like <HI>Don Philip,</HI> who joyn'd us in our Voyage; the
Ambassadour's Invitation I find pleases him, I believe he is
in our Condition, in Love; the Beauty of fair <HI>Emilia</HI> your Si∣ster,
makes him remain with us and continue unknown in
<HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>What his Reasons for his Disguise are I know not,
but I assure you I think him a Man of a good Understanding
and a generous Disposition, nor can I help liking him ex∣treamly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>He Deserves it—see here he comes my Man, and
with him the Person I spoke of.</P>

Person of an admirable Genius and unequal Cunning.</P>

<P>Noble <HI>Don Gusman,</HI> our first Request is, that you
wou'd accept an Acknowledgment (<HI>gives Gold</HI>) And
next that, you would Uouchsafe to instruct this Novice here
in Love Affairs, teach him to be useful in this Jealous Country,
to Deliver a Letter, Dog a Lady, Deceive (if occasion of∣fers)
a Privy Councellour—for we are at present in
great Perplexities.</P>

<P>Hearkee, Hearke pray Mr. <HI>Don</HI> with a hard Name, do
not lead me into Plots and Priminaries: I have had one hearty
Drubbing already, for following a Damsel of Darkness, as
black as the Devil who set me on.</P>

<P>You Rogue, 'twas I bid you do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah Sir, I believe the Old Gentleman Tempted your
Worship, so he imploy'd your Humble Servant at second
Hand; Providence send me into Merry little <HI>England</HI> again
—where I cou'd Pick up a Lady at the Play-house, carry
her Home, and have her Husband invite me to Supper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You Pick up a Lady Raskal—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir I, finer things than these black Flippits with
Death and Destruction about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that Cold Country as I have heard, it requires no
Art, no Invention to compass the Fair One; which renders
the pursuit Flat and Insipid, here every Faculties imploy'd.
This heightens the Joy and inhances the Value of that Pos∣session
which costs so dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Gusman</HI>'s an Oracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay but these Dainties are only fit meat for my Masters,
why shou'd I share the Danger that want no such Relish. I
can eat heartily of Venison if 'tis set before me, without the
Pain of Riding over Hedge or Ditch to run it down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your Tongue Sirrah—and if you have a wretch∣ed
smattering towards Wit, imploy it in practising under this
worthy Man.</P>

I am in Love my Noble Patrons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'tis that improves the

<P>Mr. <HI>Don</HI> as I called ye before, I desire you would let
me alone—and know this I'd chuse to be hang'd at my own

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace <HI>Varlet</HI> or I'll be worse to thee than all thy Fears.
Know thou Machiavel for such I esteem thee at Intrigues, we
intend to be this Afternoon at <HI>St. Dominicks</HI> where we have
both beheld these Beautiful Visions—but mine is pursu'd
close as her own Shadow by Age, and Deformity, in the
wretched Figure of a crooked Old Man; now my desire is
you'd take off this odious spy—or at least learn who he is
—and because I know you are a Man of urgent and pres∣sing
Occasions, make this Blockhead of mine necessary.</P>

<HEAD>A Song by a Gentleman, sung by Mr. Laurence.</HEAD>
<L>Bright <HI>Cloe</HI> first, with Love inflam'd my Heart;</L>
<L>The Subtle Lightning Flew thro' every part,</L>
<L>Pleasures unknown before, my Soul Surprise,</L>
<L>For all the Grace's triumph'd in her Eyes.</L>
<L>In all she did, in every thing she said,</L>
<L>Some nice peculiar Beauty was displayed.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="24"/>
Thus was I charm'd; but soon the cruel Fair,</L>
<L>My Hopes deceiv'd, and doom'd me to despair.</L>
<L>No Arts prevail'd, to conquer her desdain:</L>
<L>I beg'd, and sigh'd, and vow'd, but all in vain.</L>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Second Movement.</HEAD>
<L>As the Curse I lamented of being deny'd;</L>
<L>Gay <HI>Cupid</HI> descending, fond lover, he cry'd.</L>
<L>Never languish beneath a coy Womans disdain,</L>
<L>Love was meant for a Pleasure, and not for a Pain;</L>
<L>And when e'er a proud Heart does forbid you to enter:</L>
<L>Give it o're, and search out for another Adventure.</L>
<L>This Advice like a Cordial reliev'd my sick Mind;</L>
<L>So I went to <HI>Larissa</HI> the Gentle, the Kind:</L>
<L>To her with what ease I my Passion reveal'd!</L>
<L>For she met me half-way; so we sign'd and we seal'd.</L>
<L>But profuse of her Favours she granted so fast,</L>
<L>Love's Riot was grown too expensive to last.</L>
<L>So I left the fond Fool, tho' a Fool of my making,</L>
<L>And attended Love's call for a new undertaking.</L>

<L>Thus, thus the cruel and the kind,</L>

<L>But he, that will his bliss improve,</L>
<L>Is true to change as well as Love.</L>
<L>And like a Bee, collects his Sweets,</L>
