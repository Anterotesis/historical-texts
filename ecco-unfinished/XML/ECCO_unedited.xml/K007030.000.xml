<HEAD>A
POEM
UPON THE
UNION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HAil, fragrant <HI>MAY,</HI> thou glory of the <HI>Spring,</HI></L>
<L>To thee, the Shepherds all their Tributes bring.</L>
<L>To celebrate thy Birth the Nimphs employ</L>
<L>Their chearful hours, to show their grateful Joy.</L>
<L>Each Grove is travers'd by the rustick Swains,</L>
<L>To find the fairest Elm to grace the Plains;</L>
<L>Whilst rural Maids the Garlands weave with skill,</L>
<L>Mixing the Violet, and the Daffidill;</L>
<L>And emulating strive, by Nature taught,</L>
<L>To crown the Tree their faithful Lovers brought.</L>
<L>The constant Turtles wake to Coo and play,</L>
<L>The loving Emblems of this happy DAY:</L>
<L>Whilst smaller Birds their tuneful Carrols join,</L>
<L>And ancient Bards have made thee <HI>MONTH</HI> divine.</L>
<L>Yet faint thy Glories shone, and pale thy Fires,</L>
<L>In the past Reigns of thy departed Sires.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Not half so sweet thy Flowers, nor fresh thy Green,</L>
<L>Dame Nature's now in all her Beauty seen,</L>
<L>T' adorn the Triumphs of a glorious QUEEN.</L>
<L>A QUEEN! on whose pious Life the Heavens smile,</L>
<L>And gave Her for a Blessing to this ISLE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This ISLE made strong by her uniting Care,</L>
<L>Defies Oppression, and the <HI>Tyrant</HI>'s War.</L>
<L>Already her victorious Arms alone,</L>
<L>Have made the Monarch totter on his Throne,</L>
<L>Were She Ambitious, now the World's her own.</L>
<L>But by just Heaven inspir'd, her Banners wave,</L>
<L>She Conquers to Relieve, and Strikes to Save.</L>
<L>What <HI>Wonders</HI> for her Reign has Fate assign'd,</L>
<L>Greater than <HI>HENRY</HI> who the <HI>ROSES</HI> join'd.</L>
<L>First <HI>JAMES</HI> to <HI>Britain</HI> brought the Northren Crown,</L>
<L>But cou'd not Blend the Kingdoms into one.</L>
<L>This Glorious Work, <HI>Great Queen,</HI> was left for You;</L>
<L>You join the <HI>Hearts,</HI> as well as <HI>Nations</HI> too.</L>
<L>What Scenes of coming Joy this <HI>UNION</HI> shows,</L>
<L>Since You have fixt the <HI>Thistle</HI> to the <HI>Rose.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rejoice ye Northren <HI>Albans,</HI> spread your Sails,</L>
<L>You traffick now with happy <HI>Brittish</HI> Gales.</L>
<L>Now uncontroul'd from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West</HI> you roam,</L>
<L>From ev'ry Port convey rich Lading home.</L>
<L>Your gracious Queen with true maternal Care,</L>
<L>Lets all her Subjects, all her Blessings share.</L>
<L>Unlike those Princes who their People drain,</L>
<L>Invasive WAR unjustly to maintain,</L>
<L>And lawless Pleasures of Despotick Reign.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Reverse to such does pious <HI>ANNA</HI> stand;</L>
<L>She strives t' enrich, not to destroy her Land.</L>
<L>Her own Revenues freely she bestows,</L>
<L>To Guard her Nations from oppressing Foes.</L>
<L>She truly will be stil'd <HI>Mankind's Delight,</HI></L>
<L>Her Goodness may Antipathies unite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These <HI>Hundred Years</HI> each pregnant States-man's Brain</L>
<L>Projected this, but saw their Project vain.</L>
<L>By <HI>ANN</HI> inspir'd, the wise <HI>Godolphin</HI> found</L>
<L>The lucky Crisis, which our Wishes crown'd,</L>
<L>And all beyond the <HI>Tweed</HI> made <HI>British</HI> Ground.</L>
<L>A Monarch's Soul is by his Council shown,</L>
<L>There's the Support, or Ruin, of a Throne.</L>
<L>But here, her Choice does to the World proclaim,</L>
<L>A Day without a Cloud, a Sun without a Stain;</L>
<L>Abroad such Valour, and at Home such Guides,</L>
<L>What Guardians Heaven for <HI>Britain</HI>'s Isle provides!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Malbro</HI>'s Name, <HI>Talbot</HI>'s of Old, exceeds,</L>
<L>And in the <HI>Gaul</HI> a greater Terror breeds;</L>
<L>The Ages Bulwark, and the Nation's pride,</L>
<L>The Great Defender of the Juster side.</L>
<L>Each glorious Battle by the Hero won,</L>
<L>Seems to surpass whatever Man has done;</L>
<L>We praise, we wonder at his vast Success,</L>
<L>Till his next Conquest makes the first seem less.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Numerous Heroes eternize their Fames,</L>
<L>For endless Annals shall record their Names.</L>
<L>Fair in the List, Great <HI>Queensborough</HI> appears,</L>
<L>Whose Care perfected Hopes of many Years;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
He rightly thought, and all the Danger stood,</L>
<L>Because convinc'd 'twas for his Country's good;</L>
<L>No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fear'd the giddy Rabble's clam'rous noise,</L>
<L>Who exalts one Hour, and the next destroys.</L>
<L>The Act was great, great as his god-like Mind,</L>
<L>By Heaven inspir'd the jarring Seeds he join'd,</L>
<L>Which will produce a Fruit to bless Mankind.</L>
<L>In this true <HI>PATRIOT</HI> all the Virtues shine,</L>
<L>That wait to grace a long Illustrious Line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>ARGILE</HI> in Councils, and in Camps renown'd,</L>
<L>So young a Hero is but rarely found:</L>
<L>He, full of fire, maintain'd the noble Cause,</L>
<L>And chang'd their insolent Murmers t' applause.</L>
<L>Thus daring Courage checks the rudest Force,</L>
<L>And bars the head-strong Vulgars rapid Course;</L>
<L>Like Floods repell'd, back to their Channels go,</L>
<L>And all is calm, and all Obedience know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>SEAFIELD</HI> in whom is lodg'd the highest Trust;</L>
<L><HI>Seafield</HI> the Great, the Generous, and the Just;</L>
<L>He weigh'd the Action for his Country's Peace,</L>
<L>And knew by Union all their Feuds would cease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>MONTROSS,</HI> a faithful, glorious, loyal Name,</L>
<L>That round the World has purchas'd deathless Fame.</L>
<L>His Voice for Union, ancient Worth revives,</L>
<L>And this <HI>Montross</HI> to Copy t'other strives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The noble <HI>MAR,</HI> of famous Northren Race,</L>
<L>By All approv'd most worthy of his Place;</L>
<L>Yet nothing greater in Record shall stand,</L>

Wise <HI>Loudoun, Tweedale,</HI> and the brave <HI>Lothian,</HI></L>
<L>And all the high-born Nobles of that Train,</L>
<L>Shall Live in lasting Characters inroll'd,</L>
<L>Since their Consents restores the Age of Gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Convulsive Fears around the neighb'ring VVorld,</L>

<L>No more shall bold aspiring Princes dare,</L>

<L>Let all who Aim at Universal Sway dispair.</L>
<L>UNION thou Heaven-born Tye for Man's support,</L>
<L>Thy strength defies the Enem'ys effort.</L>
<L>A single Arrow easily is broke,</L>
<L>And shiver'd into pieces with a stroke.</L>
<L>But when with others you the Shaft shall bind,</L>
<L>It grows too strong for any threat'ning VVind:</L>
<L>So Bridegroom <HI>Britain,</HI> and his Northren Bride,</L>
<L>Much firmer stand by being thus Ally'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Instruments of this on either part,</L>
<L>VVhat daring Hand can reach their high Desert?</L>
<L>VVhat Muse can sing, what Power inspire the Lays,</L>
<L>Transcendent Worth is difficult to praise.</L>

<L>Bends all his Studies to redress our Cares.</L>
<L>This VVork compleated to <HI>Hibernia</HI>'s Land</L>
<L>He moves, to execute the Queen's Command:</L>
<L>Let all the <HI>Nereids</HI> round his Vessel wait,</L>
<L><HI>Aeolus</HI> prepare to waft this noble Freight;</L>
<L>Let gentle Gales within his Canvas play,</L>
<L>And <HI>Neptune</HI> guard him thro' thy dangerous Sea.</L>

<L>Which when produc'd enriches all Mankind,</L>
<L>On his approving Judgment we depend,</L>

<L>To <HI>Ballance Power</HI> depends on you alone,</L>
<L>When e're you please you can bestow a Throne:</L>
<L>Your very NAME whole Armies can subdue,</L>

<L>Not <HI>Mahomet</HI> so much the <HI>Turk</HI> reveres,</L>

<L>The Sultan sacred holds the <HI>Carl'wits</HI> Tyes,</L>

<L>So much is he by your Success alarm'd,</L>
