<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Greatest, if not the only
Effectual Service that can be
done a People under the Pre∣possession
of Popular Mistakes,
is to set before them in a
Clear Light, a True and Im∣partial
State of their own Circumstances.</P>
<P>The only Reason why this is so seldom done,
is from the natural Aversion Men have to
hear of their Mistakes, and that general Dis∣couragement
which Authors that honestly un∣dertake
this Work meet with from the People
they so faithfully serve.</P>
<P>If this Humour continues on one Side, or
that partial Temper on the other, this Book
will have few Friends, nor will the Author be
disappointed in it; he cannot be suppos'd so
ignorant as not to know that every Party who,
find their Errors reproved, however they are
convinced of the Truth of the Remark, will
be displeased with the Hand that seems to
<PB REF="5"/>
uncover the Nakedness they w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould rather
hide than reform.</P>
<P>This Error, however, is no less necessary
to be cur'd than the Mistakes themselves;
for the resolv'd Way we take of Cherishing
our Follies, and Resisting the Conviction of
our Reason, as also of Rejecting the Attempts
made by others; to Convince our Reason, is
the most fatal Error of the Time, as it locks
up our Vice from the Reach of the wisest
Animadversion.</P>
<P>The Author of this has, however, ventur'd
thro' all these Barricadoes, and the Fortifi∣cations
of Popular Resentment, and has made
the whole Work an Essay at a Friendly Re∣proof
to those whose Reformation he wishes,
not their Destruction, There is not a Word
in the whole Work that looks Satyrical, but
it is either pointed at those who are so far
from being curable by common Methods, that
they are grown harden'd enough to boast of
their Mistakes, or to those whose Partiality to
themselves renders all other Ways effectual.</P>
<P>Satyr, like Incision, becomes necessary when
the Humour ranckles, and the Wound threat∣ens
Mortification: When Advice ceases to
not convinice, Satyr, then reforms by making
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wore<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Error we embrace ridiculous, Shame
<PB REF="6"/>
works to make us forsake a Thing which
Instruction, Argument, or Perswasion could
have no Effect upon.</P>
<P>This respects that Part of the following
Tract which points at the Dissenters, as to
the Breeding up, Management of, and Be∣haviour
towards their Ministers. If any
plausible Objection lies against this, it seems
to be what the Author foresees from some
Well-wishers, who, tho' Owning the Fact, cry
out, <HI>These are unhappy Truths, but it is
Pity they should be told, it is Pity the
Folly of the</HI> Dissenters should be made so
<HI>Publick.</HI> To which the Answer is very plain
and short.</P>
<P>It is Pity there should be a Necessity for
making it so publick. These Sheets have
been written above Eight Years, and the Au∣thor
in Hopes that, <HI>first</HI> or <HI>last,</HI> the Dissent∣ers
would see their Impending Ruin, and re∣move
the unhappy Cause, has waited and for∣born
to speak in this Dilect to them; he has,
on many Occasions, seriously, tho' privately,
represented the Case to many of the most emi∣nent
among the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> whom he has al∣ways
found Lamenting the Distemper, but
Despairing of the Cure: He no-vu finds the
Circumstances of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> come to a
Crisis, they must take new Measures, or sink
under the Feet of their Enemies; and he is
<PB REF="7"/>
convinc'd now is the Time when they ought
to be alarm'd, if any Thing will do it.</P>
<P>As to the Plainess and Courseness of the
Manner, he makes no Apology for it. Let
them that hate them, and wish their De∣struction,
flatter and cajole them in their Fol∣lies,
to let them sleep on till they fall in the
Ruin of their own Negligence. He that
loves their Interest, will speak plain Truth to
them, whether it pleases them or no.</P>
<P><HI>The Enemies of the</HI> Dissenters who wait
for their Fall, cry, Let them alone; thus
we would have, it; he that would save them
from Ruin, must tell them whither they
are Running, and if they will not hear,
they will have the more to reproach them∣selves
with hereafter, when they remember
that they have been told of it.</P>
<P>I am verily perswaded no other Objection can be rais'd against the following Sheets. I
grant the Seasonableness of a Reproof is the
Essence of the Instructive Part; the present
Case has so many visible Tokens of Necessity,
that I cannot but think it Seasonable and
Necessary: If any are of another Opinion, I
would be glad to hear them propose some
other Method which has not been try'd, by
which the good People might be made sen∣sible
of their Error, and brought to correct
<PB REF="8"/>
and reform it. As to those who neither like
my Remedies, and yet propose none of their
own, this Discourse is not directed to them, nor
do they merit any Regard.</P>
<P>Now is the Time for the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to en∣ter
upon new Measures; now is the Time
for them to set to Work, to rectify their for∣mer
Mistakes; their Enemies are powerful;
pretended Friends have proved False; and
have betray'd them, to the Overthrow of their
Civil Interest. But if they can be perswaded
to erect upon solid Foundations, a Firm and
Lasting Scheme of a Religious <HI>Oeconomy,</HI>
the Building that shall grow up shall be such as
shall make them Invincible on one Side, and
Formidable on the other. Now is the Time
for them to stand upon their own Legs, and
be truly Independent; in which, by a steady
and faithful Adhering to God and his Cause,
and Espousing heartily all that do so, they
will soon find their Circumstances recover,
and the Figure they make deffer from any
Thing they ever mede before: Their Reli∣gious
Liberties will stand upon a better Basis
than ever, and they will be in a better Con∣dition
to support their Civil Liberties also.</P>
<P>If they are still blinded by the same Delusi∣ons;
if their Illumination is not yet to be
brought to pass, no not by their Disasters, it
<PB REF="9"/>
is a sad Sign that their Sufferings are not
yet at an End.</P>
<P>The rest of this Book being rather Hysto∣rical
than Matter of Observation, the Author
thinks it requires no Apology or Introduction,
but referrs the Reader to his own Memory
for many of the Particulars, the Story being
too Modern to need any other Authority for
the Truth of it.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The General Introduction, and Platform
of the whole Work; being a Scheme
of the PARTIES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is not a Precept the most
easily understood of any in
the Bible, which the Bles∣sed
Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> has left
upon Record, in the Book
of God. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 3. <HI>To
Think Soberly:</HI> The whole
Text may be useful to begin our Discourse
with, as a Thing, the want of which is the
Destruction and Ruin of Mankind, whether
in his single or complicated Circumstance, and
is abundantly so, in our Day, to the several
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
Parties which, at this Time, divide this Un∣happy
Nation; the whole Words are these,
<Q>To every Man among you, not to Think of
himself more highly than he ought to
Thinks but TO THINK SO∣BERLY,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To the breach of this Rule, I take leave to
say, We owe much of the Evil of <HI>Division,</HI>
and especially the Breach of Charity that
spreads Over this Nation; and no Man can
do a greater piece of Service to the People,
on both Sides, than to Instruct them how to
<HI>think of themselves.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuit of this Work, tho' the Scheme
may be Long, yet it is evident that the Sub∣ject
is so Large, and the Extent of it so Great,
that it will be requisite to study as much
Brevity as possible.</P>
<P>The Business of these Sheets is Compre∣hended
in these few Words, an Endeavour
to give a clear View, to every Party, of the
True State of their Circumstances, as they
respect themselves, and as they respect one
another, that if such a Thing be yet remain∣ing
in the Nature of Man, they may learn
to <HI>think of themselves,</HI> and of one another,
as <HI>they ought to think.</HI>—The chief Design
is, to Examine the State of the <HI>Dissenting
Interest,</HI> which I shall do Historically, and
join with it due Observations; and as the
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Interests, Originals, and Views of the other
Parties, will necessarily come in the Way to
be treated of, in order to make the Story
coherent, and to bring the Parts to consist
with one another, and all with the general
Design; so we shall, as Episodes to the Plan
of the Work, lead the Reader into most of
the considerable Circumstances of our pre∣sent
divided State in this Nation.</P>
<P>In order to a clear Understanding of Things
as we go, it will be necessary to enter a lit∣tle
into the Consideration of two general
Heads.</P>
<P>1. To give you a general View of the
present State of the Nation, as to Parties,
and as to the Division those Parties have
now brought us to.</P>
<P>2. To bring up those Parties from their
Original, and consider their seperate Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<Q>After this it may be more to the Purpose
to fix upon the especial Head which
this Book is design'd to Treat of <HI>viz.</HI>
that Party, or Body of Men among us,
who we call <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and the State
of their Circumstances Past, Present,
and in Prospect.</Q>
<P>The present State of the Nation may most
perfectly and clearly be understood, without
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
any search into Antiquity, other than by look∣ing
back to the <HI>Late Revolution:</HI> The <HI>Er∣rors</HI>
of <HI>Past Reigns,</HI> the <HI>Rancour</HI> of the <HI>Civil-War,</HI>
the <HI>Fury</HI> of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> the <HI>Intri∣gues</HI>
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the <HI>Jehu Dri∣vings</HI>
of King <HI>James</HI> II. all had their Periods
here: To repeat them a little at length.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rancour of the Civil-War ended here,</HI>
Those Festred Wounds of the State, which
had been too severely search'd into by the <HI>Old
Parliament</HI> Times; but being too hastily
skin'd over in the Transports of the <HI>Restora∣tion,</HI>
began to bleed a fresh, and appear'd ready
to break forth again. The <HI>Impositions, Ex∣travagancies,</HI>
Trampling on <HI>Laws,</HI> Oppres∣sing
of <HI>Subjects,</HI> Invading <HI>Property,</HI> Persecu∣ting
for <HI>Conscience,</HI> and Suspending the <HI>Laws,</HI>
being the same as before, and the <HI>Subject's</HI>
Grievances were founded on the same <HI>Questi∣ons</HI>
which were disputed, and <HI>Complaints</HI>
which were granted by the <HI>Petition of Right:</HI>
The Years 1637 to 1641 were all acted over
again in the Wicked, but more Politick Reign
of <HI>Charles</HI> II, and the Fury of <HI>Civil-War</HI> it
self began to revive in the Popish and Tyran∣nical
Government of King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Revolution</HI> heal'd all these Di∣stempers;
and the Gangreen'd Member be∣ing
Cut off from the Body, the <HI>Amputation</HI>
left the Body, as every one thought, and
expected, perfectly Sound, Healthy and Com∣pleat.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14"/>
It was not the least Article of the Health
of the Body Politick, that the <HI>Seeds of Strife</HI>
which, for many Years, had been Sown
among us, on Account of <HI>Religious Matters,</HI>
seem'd to be entirely Rooted out. A gene∣ral
<HI>Charity</HI> growing up in the Place of river∣ted
<HI>Bitterness</HI> and <HI>Religious Strife;</HI> good
Men promised themselves a rich Harvest of
Prosperity to the Commonwealth. The
<HI>Dissenters</HI> had been the Handle, for many
Years, by which the Politicians had taken
hold of our <HI>Properties;</HI> and taken Advan∣tages
to introduce all the several Methods
of <HI>Arbitrary Government.</HI> The suppressing
these, as dangerous Enemies to the State, had
been the Pretence for <HI>Perscutions, Prosecu∣tions,
Quo-warranto's,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>Oppres∣sion.</HI>
These Things were carry'd to that
Height, and such pernitious Use was made
of the <HI>Penal-Laws</HI> against <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that
they grew Odious, even to the <HI>Church-men</HI>
themselves: Men of Charity could not see
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> drag'd out of their Houses and
Meetings to the Courts of <HI>Justice</HI> and the
Goals fill'd with their Neighbours, of the
best Credit and Trade, meerly for Worship∣ping
God in their own Way, without Infi∣nite
dislike and regret; Men of <HI>Liberty</HI> and
<HI>Property</HI> could not, without abhorrence, see
the Spoil made of Men's Estates by Laws
against <HI>Popery.</HI> These Things brought the
<HI>Moderate Church-men,</HI> and Lovers of <HI>Liberty,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
to espouse even the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> who they
called <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> and oppose the Ravages
made upon their <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> not
for the Sake of their <HI>Dissenting,</HI> which they
did not approve of, but for the Sake of those
<HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> which they en∣joy'd
in Common with them, and which
they thought themselves obliged to Pre∣rerve:—
And in this Conjunction of <HI>Church∣men</HI>
and <HI>Dissenters,</HI> began the Name of
<HI>Whigg,</HI> a Word of Contempt, and fetch'd
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> where it signify'd a People
famous for their Opposition to the En∣croachments
of the Crown, tho', as they
represented them, mingled with <HI>Enthusi∣asms</HI>
and <HI>Religious Madness;</HI> of which more
hereafter.</P>
<P>All this, as before, seem'd bury'd in the
Toleration of <HI>Dissenters,</HI> granted by Parlia∣ment
after the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Act 1. <HI>William</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> Cap. xviii.—and entituled, <HI>An Act to Ex∣empt
their Majesties</HI> Protestant <HI>Subjects from
the Penalty of certain Laws, &amp;c.</HI>—I men∣tion
the Title, because of the Dispute which
followed in the Process of these Things
against this Act, being deem'd an <HI>Act of To∣leration,</HI>
and of which I shall speak more
largely in its Place.</P>
<P>During the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> the
Spirit of Jealousy, laid asleep (as I have said)
by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> continu'd quiet, and the
Differences in Religious Matters seemed to
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
carry no Weight in them sufficient to disturb
the Government, or the Minds of the Peo∣ple.
The King, by Principle of an exten∣sive
Charity, and profess'dly averse to all
Coertion, not only forwarded the Act of
<HI>Toleration,</HI> which, as above, was granted to
<HI>Protestant Dissenters,</HI> but used his Endea∣vour
to have render'd it more compleat, by
Turning the Edge of the Act Establishing
the Taking the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> as a Test of Pre∣ferment,
from the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to the <HI>Papists</HI>
only, according to the true Original and
Design both of the Law itself, and of those
that made it, <HI>but</HI> Sathan <HI>hindred,</HI> for the King
soon saw that it might be said of the Spi∣rit
of the <HI>High-Church</HI> Party, as it was of
<HI>Lazarus, That he is not Dead, but Sleepeth;</HI>
and that however suppress'd by the <HI>Revo∣lution,</HI>
and reduc'd to a Temper with the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> (for the Sake of their having as∣sisted
in the Deposing-King <HI>James,</HI> and
fusing the Caresses he made to them, in
Order to draw them, in to support him
against them, the Church) yet that they
would all take Fire again, if touch'd in
this sensible Part; that they esteem'd this
<HI>Test-Act</HI> as a Pale about the Church, and
the Repealing it, as an Attempt to let in
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to trample it under Foot;
the King, <HI>I say,</HI> finding the <HI>Church-men</HI>
alarm'd at the very Motion, and his Ma∣jesty
being not willing to lay the Foun∣dation
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
of new Divisions, or of reviving
the old Animosities, which were so happily
bury'd, found himself oblig'd to drop the
Thing, and desist from Declaring himself
too plainly in any Affair, which must have
embroil'd him with one Part of the Nation
in Favour of another Part, who, however
Numerous and Rich, were not able to carry
him thro' it.</P>
<P>However, I have nam'd this as well to
record the Attempt that Glorious Prince
made at Rooting out the very Remains of
<HI>Persecution</HI> among us, as to note, that this
was the first Occasion on which the High∣Church-Men
shew'd, that they had not bu∣ry'd
their Animosities and Aversions to the
<HI>Dissenters;</HI> only laid them asleep 'till they
might find a more proper Occasion to dis∣cover
them to their Advantage.</P>
<P>The Steps the King took in this Matter
were but few, however, they were such as
testify'd both his Sense of the Faithfulness
of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to the Publick Interest, and
the just Weight they ought to bear in the
State: His Majesty had proposed it to the
Persons whom he most trusted at that
Time, and had used some Arguments to
bring over some of them to be willing, yet
found many averse to it, those who ap∣pear'd
willing, yet disswaded him from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Attempt, as what would create him great
Difficulties at a Time when his other Af∣fairs
requir'd a general Composure; and, in
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
short, the Generality of the Council ap∣pear'd
not well enclin'd to joyn in it; yet
the King's Reasons prevailed, and it was
agreed, That his Majesty should move it to
the Parliament, which he did, in his Speech
to Both Houses, on the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> 1689,
immediately after the happy Settlement of
the Crown: His Majesty's Words are these,
<Q><P>I know you are sensible there is a Necessity
of some Law to settle the Oaths to be taken by
all Persons, to be admitted to such Places: I
recommend it to your Care to make a speedy
Provision for it; and as I doubt not but you
will sufficiently provide against Papists, so I
hope you will leave room for the Admission of all
Protestants that are able and willing to serve.</P>
<P>This Conjunction in my Service will tend to
the better Uniting you amongst your selves, and
the Strengthening you against your Common
Adversaries.</P></Q></P>
<P>But the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> fir'd at the
Proposals, and some warm Speeches were
made within Doors, as well as Reflections
without Doors, all which I shall bury in
this brief Hint, that the King, finding it was
not a proper Time for it, prosecuted it no
farther, and so it died of itself.—The War,
and the various Hurries of the Time, put
the Remembrance of it off, and the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
receiv'd no Injury from the Suggestion.</P>
<P>But tho' the making them easy by a Law
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
could not thus be obtain'd, yet, as I noted
before, throughout this King's whole Reign
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> receiv'd all the Favour and
Encouragement they could expect; they were
frequently possess'd of Posts of considerable
Profit and Trusts, and Commissions of all
Sorts were put into their Hands. If they did
conform Occasionally, as I shall have Time
to enquire in the farther Prosecution of this
Affair, <HI>Well and Good:</HI> But those who did
not, found no Disadvantage in it; nor was
any so forward as to prosecute the Law in
that Case, knowing, that altho' the King
would not have so far concern'd himself as
to grant <HI>Noli prosequi</HI> in such Cases against a
due Proceeding at Law, yet that all other
Discouragements would be given to it, and
the Persons marked as particularly forward
to displease the Government, and oppose
the healing Designs of the King.</P>
<P>Whether this was the Cause or no, I will
not affirm; but this is certain, that no Man
ever receiv'd any Disturbances of this Na∣ture
during the Reign of King <HI>William;</HI> and
yet it might, with some Assurance, be en∣quired
of any of those who are now so for∣ward
to lay the whole Weight of the
<HI>Church</HI>'s Safety upon this Act, what In∣jury
the <HI>Church</HI> received by that Lenity?
Or in what Particular the <HI>Dissenters</HI> could be
said to make any Encroachment, or Invasion,
upon the <HI>Church</HI> during that Time? On
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
the contrary, I believe it may easily be de∣monstrated,
that the Interest of the <HI>Dissent∣ers</HI>
many Ways lost Ground by their own
Way of Improving the <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Ease</HI>
they enjoy'd; of which in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>As to Parties:</HI> Then the Division, through∣out
this whole Reign, lay chiefly between
the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and the <HI>Williamite: Whigg</HI>
and <HI>Tory,</HI> tho' Names of too general Use
among us, even then, yet signify'd little
more than what they ought to signify now,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Friends</HI> and the <HI>Enemies</HI> of the
<HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, towards the latter End of his
Majesty's Reign, a Court and Country Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on
got into our Management, and great
Heats, Turnings in, and Turnings out, fol∣low'd
upon it; together with several Clash∣ings
of a Party with the King about Dispo∣sing
the Forfeited Estates in <HI>Ireland,</HI> Re-as∣sumtions
of Grants, Disbanding of Forces,
and the like, in which, Matters of Religion
had no Manner of Concern, and both <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
and <HI>Church-men</HI> were found on both
Sides; only with this just Observation in Fa∣vour
of <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that, generally Speaking,
they always adher'd to the King.—They
thought the Heat with which those People
push'd at his Majesty for the Disposing of
the Forfeited Estates unkind, because of the
Merit of the Persons to whom the Grants
were made; the just Claim they had to his
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
Majesty's Bounty; and the Equity of giving
them their Rewards out of the Spoil of that
Country they had spent so much Blood, and
hazarded so much to Reduce: They thought
it ungrateful that the Opposition the King
made to the Disbanding the Army (which,
however, was with a Kind of Submission,
even to his own Subjects, a Thing unusual
from the Throne) should be charg'd on the
King's Principles, as if designing to Rule by
an Army; and that after all he had done to
save us from <HI>Tyranny,</HI> that we should sug∣gest
a Design in his Majesty to <HI>Enslave</HI> us:
Nor was the King himself altogether un∣concern'd
at the Attempt of that Nature,
which he found went a great Way among
the People, and therefore, when he came to
Pass the Bill, he express'd himself, for that
Purpose, in his Speech to the Parliament, in
the following Words:</P>
<P>I Came to Pass the Bill for Disbanding the
Army as soon as I understood it was ready
for me.</P>
<P>Tho', in our present Circumstances, there
appears great Hazard in breaking such a
Number of the Troops; and tho' I might think
my self unkindly used, that those Guards who
came over with me to your Assistance, and have
constantly attended me in all the Actions
wherein I have been engaged, should be re∣moved
from me, yet it is my fix'd Opinion,
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
That nothing can be so fatal to us, as, that
any Distrust or Jealousie should arise between
me and my People, which I must own would
have been very unexpected, after what I have
Undertaken, Ventured, and Acted, for the
Restoring and Securing of their Liberties.</P>
<P>And here I cannot omit to observe, how
just the Retaliations of Heaven are, even in
Directing the Injustices and Ingratitudes of
Men, so as that they may read their Sin in
their Punishment, and those who have dealt
ungratefully and unjustly by their Bene∣factors
frequently arrive to a Time, as some
are said to do now, when they fall by the
Ingratitude and Injustice of those they have
most effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>In this Posture Affairs stood at the Death.
of that excellent Prince, and I have the
rather nam'd these Things, tho' they seem
a Digression, that those who look back into
those Times, and compare them with the
Present, may know at what Epocha to begin
their Reckoning, from what Account of Time,
and from what Period to date the Events
which may take up so much Room in the
Histories of these Times.</P>
<P>The King Dying about this Time, more
mortally wounded with the pointed Rage of
Divided Parties, and an Ungrateful People,
than by the Dislocation of his Shoulder, or
Collar-Bone, by the Fall from his Horse,
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
was succeeded by our Present Queen the
Eighth of <HI>March,</HI> 170 1/2; and no sooner was
Her Majesty Seated in the Throne, no
sooner had She taken the Administration into
Her Hands, but the Dead Monsters reviv'd,
and, like <HI>Cadmus</HI>'s Field, all the Bones of
the Slaughter'd Furies stood up in Bands of
Armed Men.</P>
<P>In an unhappy Hour the Queen, in Her
Speech to Her first Parliament, at the
End of the Session, exprese'd Herself
(however, not Imagining the evil Use that
would be made of it) with a True and
Sincere Zeal for the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
assuring them of Her especial Favour, and
that those who were most Zealous for the
said Church should have the greatest Share
in Her Majesty's Concern, as follows:</P>
<P>I shall always wish, that no Difference of
Opinion among those that are equally affec∣ed
to my Service, may be the occasion of Heats
and Animosities among themselves: I shall be
very careful to Preserve and Maintain the
<HI>Act of Toleration,</HI> and to set the Minds of all
my People at quiet: My own Principle must
always keep me entirely firm to the Interests
and Religion of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and
will incline me to Countenance those who have
The truest Zeal to support it.</P>
<P>It is not the first Time that this mis-inter∣preted
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
Word ZEAL has been taken in a
wrong Sense in the World. And, not to di∣gress
upon the evil Consequences which, in
all Ages, have attended the Mis-construction
of this Word, never was it taken in a worse
Sense, or apply'd to a worse Use, and more
remote to the Intention of the Person Speak∣ing
it, than on this Occasion.</P>
<P>The Clergy, especially, taking hold of it,
would neither give Leave, or Time, for any
Body, no not for the Queen Herself, to make
any other Explications, than such as they, for
the Ends which afterwards appear'd, thought
fit to make; but, making the Queen's
Words speak their Meaning, they began to
Open, and rais'd a most unaccountable Hur∣ricane
in the Nation, letting the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
know that their Day was come; that their
Reign was at an End; that now they had a
<HI>Church of England</HI> Queen; and the Church
would re-assume Her Dignity and Superiori∣ty;
that She would no more be insulted by
<HI>Schismaticks</HI> and <HI>Phanaticks;</HI> that Her Ma∣jesty
was the True <HI>Defender</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI>
and, that She had recommended to them a
<HI>Zealous Concern</HI> for the Interest of the
<HI>Church;</HI> and they would not let slip the
Occasion; they publickly declared, that <HI>Zeal</HI>
for the Interest and Safety of the <HI>Church</HI>
could be capable of no other Construction,
but <HI>Zeal</HI> to pull down the Pride and Inso∣lence
of <HI>Schismaticks;</HI> that the <HI>Church's</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
Enemies must be destroy'd, and <HI>Faction</HI>
rooted out; and there could be no <HI>Zeal</HI> for
the <HI>Church,</HI> but such as consisted in Ridding
Her, for ever, of the Fears of Her Enemies;
that the <HI>Church</HI> had no Enemies now in her
View but the <HI>Phanaticks;</HI> that the <HI>Papists</HI>
were sufficiently fenc'd against by the <HI>Laws</HI>
and <HI>Aversions</HI> of the People to the Idolatry of
the <HI>Romish Worship;</HI> but, that the <HI>Presbyteri∣ans</HI>
were a <HI>Viperous Brood,</HI> nourish'd in our
own Bowels, crept in within the Pale, and
who had taken Advantage of the Circum∣stances
of the Nation, under the late Admi∣nistrations,
to get a Kind of a Legal Admissi∣on,
which they pretended to call an <HI>Esta∣blishment;</HI>
that, all along, under the Shadow
of this Lenity and Forbearance, they had
encroach'd on the very <HI>Essential Priviledges</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> Sapping and Undermining
the Foundation of the <HI>Church of England;</HI>
and, that now was the Time to recover
themselves when supported by a True
<HI>Church of England</HI> Queen, Her Majesty al∣so
having invited them to it by Her most
Gracious Speech, and with promises of
Her Favour and Affection.</P>
<P>With this, they forgot not to fill the
whole Nation with the most scandalous,
odious, and unjust Reflections upon the Per∣son
and Government of the Deceased King,
that could be devised, Representing the Na∣tion
as deliver'd from him; his Reign as
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
fatal to the <HI>Church,</HI> and dishonourable to the
<HI>Kingdom;</HI> in Contempt of his Actions, and
of his Person, they form'd two <HI>By-Words,</HI> or
<HI>Proverbial Speeches,</HI> which, by the Populari∣ty
of the reigning Distemper of those Times,
became <HI>Proverbial,</HI> and the <HI>Shiboleth</HI> of the
Day; I forbear to mention who they obtain'd
to speak that Language, in Respect to one
Part, and in Pity to the other; especially
now they are in a Way of like Treatment;
these <HI>By-Words</HI> were, <HI>a Heart entirely</HI> Eng∣ish,
and <HI>Retrieving the Nation's Honour;</HI>
simplying, that King <HI>William</HI> was not a Na∣tive,
and that the Honour of the Nation had
suffer'd in his Hands; but Heaven has
aveng'd his Memory in both these, and there∣fore
I take no farther Notice of it here.</P>
<P>This Heat and Fury of the Clergy went
to that Height, that even it became ludi∣crous,
and attended with all the little Ex∣cesses
which a Person elevated beyond the
Government of himself, by some suddain
Joy, is usually subject to; and as a known Au∣thor
remarks, That upon the Restoration of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Excesses and Transports
of the Clergy and People run out into Revels,
May-Poles, and all Manner of Extravagancies;
so, at this time, there were more May-Poles
set up in One Year, in <HI>England,</HI> than had been
in 20 Years before; Ballads for the <HI>Church</HI>
was another Expression of their <HI>Zeal,</HI>
wherein, generally, the <HI>Chorus,</HI> or Burthen
<PB N="18" REF="27" MS="y"/>
of the Song, was, <HI>Down with the</HI> Presbyteri∣ans;
and to such a Height were Things
brought, that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> began to be in∣sulted
in every Place; their <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI>
and <HI>Assemblies</HI> assaulted by the Mob; and
even their <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> were
scarce admitted to pass the Streets.</P>
<P>The Violences of the Day being but of a
short Continuance, I choose to bury them as
much as will consist with the Connection of
the Thing, being unwilling to record more of
the Folly of those Times than Necessity ob∣liges
me to: The rest may a little be guess'd
at, by the famous Expression of that known
Malefactor <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> who first made him∣self
remarkable to the World on this Occa∣sion,
by a Sermon preach'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in
which he had an Expression to this Purpose,
<HI>That he could not be a True Son of the
Church of</HI> England <HI>who did not lift up the
Banner of the Church against the</HI> Dissenters.</P>
<P>This was the Sermon upon which an
Author, till then not much known, wrote
that unhappy Book called, <HI>The shortest Way
with the</HI> Dissenters.—In which, seem∣ing
to fall in with the Times, he urg'd, with
the most pungent Reafons, and with utmost
seeming Eagerness, the Absolute Necessity of
Rooting out the <HI>Dissenters</HI> from the Nation.</P>
<P>The wisest <HI>Church-men</HI> in the Nation
were deceiv'd by; this Book; those whose
Temper fell in with the Times hugg'd and
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
embrac'd it; applauded the Proposal; fill'd
their Mouths with the Arguments made
Use of therein; and an eminent <HI>Church-man,</HI>
in the <HI>Country,</HI> wrote a Letter to his Friend
in <HI>London,</HI> who had sent him the Book, in
the following Words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Receiv'd yours, and with it that Pamphlet
which makes so much Noise, called, <HI>The</HI>
shortest Way with the Dissentrers, for which
I thank you: I joyn with that Author in all
he says, and have such a Value for the Book,
that, next to the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> and the <HI>Sacred
Comments,</HI> I take it for the most valuable
Piece I have. I pray God put it into Her
Majesty's Heart to put what is there proposed
in Execution.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>On the other Hand, the Soberer <HI>Church∣men,</HI>]
whose Principles were founded on
<HI>Charity,</HI> and who had their Eye upon the
<HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> of their Country, as
that to which their own <HI>Liberties</HI> were an∣nex'd,
tho' they still believed the Book to
be written by a <HI>High-Church-Man,</HI> yet open∣ly
exclaim'd against the Proposal, condemn'd
the Warmth that appear'd in the Clergy
against their Brethren, and openly profess'd,
that such Men as <HI>Sacheverell</HI> and his Bre∣thren
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
would blew up the Foundations of
the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>But either Side had scarce Time to disco∣ver
their Sentiments, when the Book ap∣pear'd
to have been written by a <HI>Dissenter;</HI>
that it was design'd in Derision of the Stan∣dard
held up by <HI>Sacheverell</HI> and others; that
it was a Satyr upon the Fury of the <HI>Church∣men,</HI>
and a Plot to make the rest discover
themselves; nothing was more strange than to
see the Effect upon the whole Nation which
this little Book, a contemptible Pamphlet
of but three Sheets of Paper, had, and in so
short a Time too; the most Forward, Hot,
and Furious, as well among the Clergy as
others, blush'd when they reflected how far
they had applauded the Book; raged that
such an Abuse should be put upon the
<HI>Church;</HI> and as they were obliged to damn
the Book, so they were strangely hamper'd
between the doing so, and pursuing their
Rage at the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> the greater Part,
the better to qualify theraselves to condemn
the Author, came earnestly in to condemn
tie Principle; for it was impossible to do
one without the other.</P>
<P>They labour'd Incessantly, both in <HI>Print</HI>
and in <HI>Pulpit,</HI> to prove, That this was a hor∣rible
Slander upon the <HI>Church,</HI> but this still
answer'd the Author's End the more; for
they could never Clear the <HI>Church</HI> of the
Slander, without openly Condeming the
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
Practice; nor could they possibly Condemn
the Practice without Censuring these Cler∣gymen,
who had gone such a length already,
as to say the same Thing in Print: Nor
could all their Rage at the Author of that
Book, contribute any thing to Clear them,
but still made the Better Side the Worse. It
was plain they had own'd the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> had
preach'd up the Necessity of <HI>Expelling,</HI> and
<HI>Rooting Out</HI> the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in their <HI>Sermons,</HI>
and Printed; that it was evident they had
applauded the Book it self, as before, till
they knew the Author; and there was no
other way to prevent the Odium falling on
the whole Body of the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
but by giving up the Authors of those <HI>Mad
Principles,</HI> and openly professing <HI>Moderate
Principles</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>The severe Usage of the Author encreas'd
this Turn; they Fin'd him, Imprison'd him,
Pillory'd him, and, indeed, Ruin'd him:
But his Contempt of them, even under all
his Sufferings, his <HI>Hymn to the Pillory,</HI> which
he made in Derision of them, and publish'd
the very Day they expos'd him; the Shouts
of the People when he was taken down, and
the General Abhorrence shown, as well
by <HI>moderate Church-men</HI> as <HI>Dissenters,</HI> at the
Severities used against him, all testify'd, that
the whole Nation had receiv'd a New Tin∣cture,
and the furious Spirit, aforesaid, recei∣ved
a visible Check from this Accident, how∣ever
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
ever trifling in it self. But, that the Reader
may see this more plainly, by the Conse∣quences,
it is worth observing. That the
Government, taking a right View of the
Stream of the Peoples Affections, and Her
Majesty, whose Goodness naturally dislik'd
the Violence of those Spirits who were run∣ning
Things to these Extreams, gave a full
Turn to the popular Humour.</P>
<P>The Men of <HI>Moderate Principles</HI> about
Her Majesty fell in with the Occasion, and
representing how ill a Use some People had
made of Her Majesty's Words, soon con∣vinc'd
Her Majesty, that the Destruction of
all Her <HI>Dissenting Subjects</HI> was aim'd at;
which, as it was a Thought the Queen ab∣horr'd,
so, in Her next Speech to the Par∣liament,
Her Majesty gave a publick Testi∣mony
of Her dislike of those Things; and,
on other Occasions, testify'd some wonder,
that any of Her Subjects should so far mis∣take
Her Meaning, as to take Encourage∣ment
from Her Words to widen the Breach
among Her <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects, which was
so well closed, as to Affection and Int'rest, by
the <HI>Revolution</HI> and the <HI>Toleration;</HI> which
<HI>Toleration,</HI> Her Majesty express'd, on all Oc∣casions,
Her resolution to Maintain; and, to
put the <HI>Dissenters</HI> out of all Pain, as to pri∣vate
Encroachments on it, assur'd them, in
another Speech, of Her resolving to preserve
the <HI>Toleration,</HI> with the Word <HI>Inviolably:</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
Inviting, and on all Occasions earnestly pres∣sing
Her Subjects to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> among
themselves, as the only Way to keep them
Safe; to disappoint their Enemies Abroad
and at Home, and to make them a Happy
People.</P>
<P>At the Opening the Session of Parliament
for the Year 1703, Her Majesty began these
Exhortations in the following Words:</P>
<P>I want Words to express to you my ear∣nest
Desires of seeing all my Subjects in per∣fect
<HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> among themselves;
I have nothing so much at Heart as their
general <HI>Wellfare</HI> and <HI>Happiness;</HI> let Me,
therefore, desire you all, that you would
carefully avoid any <HI>Heats</HI> or <HI>Divisions</HI> that
may disappoint me of that Satisfaction, and
give Encouragement to the Common Enemies
of our <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all: But as the Temper of
<HI>Moderation</HI> prevail'd at Court, so was the
Gentlemen of <HI>Moderate Principles</HI> encourag∣ed,
And, in a few Days, a Revolution at
Court, to the general Satisfaction of the Na∣tion,
was effected, by displacing the D—
of <HI>B</HI>—Lord <HI>P</HI>—<HI>S;</HI> the E—of
<HI>No</HI>—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,</HI> Secretary of State; Sir <HI>Edward
Seymour,</HI> Comptroller of the Houshold, and
all their Adherents and Dependents; this
happen'd in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1704.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33"/>
Some People have blam'd the Author of
the aforesaid Pamphlet, called <HI>The Shortest
Way,</HI> &amp;c. for that he did not quote either
In the Margin, or otherwise the Sermon of
<HI>Sacheverell,</HI> aforesaid, or such other Authors
from whom his Notions were drawn, which
would have justify'd him in what he had
suggested; but these Men do not see the
Design of the Book at all, or the Effect it
had on the People it pointed at: It is true,
this had prevented the Fate of the Man, but
it had, at the same Time, taken off the Edge
of the Book, and that which now cut the
Throat of a whole Party, would not then
have given the least Wound. The Case the
Book pointed at, was to speak in the first
Person of the <HI>Party,</HI> and then, thereby, not
only speak their Language, but make them
acknowledge it to be theirs, which they did
so openly, that confounded all their Attempts
afterwards to deny it, and to call it a <HI>Scan∣dal</HI>
thrown upon them by another.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd here, without great
Injustice, That the present Lord Treasure,
then Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> and Speaker of the <HI>House
of Commons,</HI> was the Principal Agent in
the introducing these <HI>Moderate,</HI> and <HI>Heal∣ing
Councils;</HI> and in representing to Her
Majesty, in behalf of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> the
ruinous Designs form'd by a Party of Men
who would not only have involv'd Her
Majesty in a Troublesome and Ungrateful
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
Breach with so considerable a Body of Her
Subjects, but would have engag'd Her in a
bitter and furious <HI>Persecution</HI> for <HI>Conscience
sake,</HI> both, contrary to Her own Disposi∣tion,
and contrary to the True Interest of
Her Kingdom; and if, when Her Majesty
came to be rightly inform'd of these Things,
it fill'd Her with a just Indignation at the In∣struments,
it cannot be wonder'd at.</P>
<P>The happy Turn, as above, being given to
Affairs, the Face of all things alter'd imme∣diately;
all the Attempts for an <HI>Occasional-Bill</HI>
made after this, miscarry'd, and might
have done so to this Day, had the Patriots of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> been True to their Interest.</P>
<P>That Bill, which was lost, the Year be∣fore,
on a meer Nicety in the <HI>House of Com∣mons,</HI>
and their insisting on a Trifle, which
they would most gladly have afterwards
given up, was the next Year Oppos'd by the
whole Court, and thrown Out of the House
by a great Majority.</P>
<P>Nor did Her Majesty only come in to the
moderate Schemes above, but to this Epoca
is referr'd the Time when the Lord Trea∣surer,
<HI>Go</HI>—<HI>phin,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Marl</HI>—<HI>h,</HI>
the Dutchess, and many more, who during
the whole Reign of the late King, had been
on the other Side to an Extream, who were
always <HI>High-Church,</HI> and had been counted,
by some, among the <HI>worst Enemies</HI> the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
had, came over, and became what from
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
that Day, they were esteem'd all over the
Nation, <HI>viz. Whiggs.</HI></P>
<P>This, afterwards, was sum'd up against
them, as a Reproach, when that unhappy
Breach came in among us, which laid the
foundation of the <HI>last Revolution</HI> at Court:
I mean, when, after the Displacing Mr. Se∣cretary
<HI>H</HI>—<HI>ly,</HI> the <HI>Juncto,</HI> or <HI>Whigg-Lords,</HI>
set up against the <HI>Ministry,</HI> that is, against
the Duke of <HI>M</HI>—<HI>gh,</HI> and the Treasurer,
<HI>Go</HI>—<HI>phin;</HI> when the Distinction between
<HI>Old-Whigg</HI> and <HI>New-Whigg</HI> was first brought
upon the Stage, and the Friends of the
<HI>Juncto</HI> threw this in the Teeth of the <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI>
as aforesaid, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were on∣ly
<HI>Modern-Whiggs;</HI> that they were not
<HI>Whiggs</HI> from Principle, but Interest; that
they were <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>High-Fliers</HI> in their
Original, and were still so in their Inclinati∣on;
that they only espous'd the <HI>Whiggs</HI> now,
as that Interest that best serv'd their Turn;
that they were all brought over by Mr.
<HI>H</HI>—<HI>ly,</HI> and would all return to their first
Principles, when ever a like Occasion of∣fer'd.
But this by the by.</P>
<P>In the pursuit of the <HI>Moderate Councils</HI>
which now began to Govern, as abovesaid,
several Great, Happy, and Successful Steps
were taken in the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> both at
Home and Abroad, which, tho' they are
fresh in the Memory of all that Read, or
take Notice of the <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> yet, as
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
all who may remember the Falls may not
have observ'd the Connection between those
<HI>Successes</HI> Abroad, and the <HI>Measures</HI> at Home,
and how a happy Series of the First attend∣ed
the Wisdom, Prudence, and Unanimity
of the last, it may not be amiss, with great
Brevity, to review a few of the great Actions
of those three or four Years, both Abroad
and at Home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministry</HI> was no sooner out of the
Hands of the <HI>Tories,</HI> but the Scale turn'd
Abroad; the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> seem'd
to have been a little check'd in his Designs,
the Year before, by the Revolt of the Duke
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and found the <HI>Confederates</HI> not
a little surpriz'd at the rapid Course of the
<HI>French</HI> Conquests on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Da∣nube.</HI>
The Marshal de <HI>Tallard</HI> had taken
<HI>Landau,</HI> and beaten the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army at
the Battle of <HI>Spierback,</HI> the Campaign be∣fore;
ruining entirely the <HI>Hessian</HI> and <HI>Pala∣tine</HI>
Troops, and was now upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
with a <HI>Royal-Army,</HI> threatning to Ravage the
Circle of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and the County of
<HI>Hessia;</HI> but chiefly with a Design to Em∣barrass
Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the Im∣perialists,
so that they should not be able to
rescue the Emperor, who, in the mean time,
was threatn'd by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to
be attack'd, even in his Capital of <HI>Vienna;</HI>
that Elector having already over-run <HI>Swa∣bia;</HI>
taken the Imperial Cities of <HI>Ulm,
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
Meminghen,</HI> and <HI>Kempen;</HI> ravag'd <HI>Tiroll,</HI> and
taken <HI>Passau;</HI> and was preparing to attack
<HI>Lintz,</HI> and then <HI>Vienna.</HI> In this Exigence
of Affairs the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> by
Concert with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Emperor's
General, Prince <HI>Eugene of Savoy,</HI> agreed to
quit the Pursuit of the War in <HI>Flanders;</HI>
leave Count <HI>Tallard</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Army
on the <HI>Rhine</HI> at Liberty to undertake what
ever he thought fit; and with the Greatest
and Best Army that has been seen in that
Part of the World, perhaps ever seen, took
that prodigious March into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> which,
ended in the famous Battle of <HI>Blenheim,
August</HI> the 2d. 1704, taking Count <HI>Tallard</HI>
Prisoner, and entirely Expelling the Elector
of <HI>Bavaria</HI> out of his own Country, from
whence he continues an Exile to this
Day.</P>
<P>This was the first visible Blessing on the
Arms of Her Majesty, after the happy
Change of Her Affairs at Home, as if Hea∣ven
had resolv'd to encourage a Nation new∣ly
come to their <HI>Politick Senses;</HI> and who
were but beginning to take <HI>right Measures</HI>
for making themselves Great and Happy.</P>
<P><HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> was no sooner establish'd
at Home, but <HI>Victory</HI> came in from Abroad,
and the Queen, in Conjunction with Her
<HI>New-Ministry,</HI> encourag'd by this happy
Success Abroad, pursues the same Advice
at Home; and, carrying on all Things by the
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
same happy Measures, repeats the pressing
Instances She had made before to Her next
Parliament, which met in <HI>November,</HI> That
they would Unite, and lay aside all Divisi∣ons
and Animosities among themselves, as
the only Way to make them all Happy.
This you have at large in Her Speech to
Both Houses, <HI>October</HI> the 24th, 1704, as
follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords and Gentlemen,</OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but tell you how essential it is for
attaining these great Ends Abroad, of
which we have so hopeful a Prospect, that
we should be entirely United at Home.</P>
<P>'Tis plain our Enemies have no Encourage∣ment
left but what arises from their Hopes of
our Divisions; 'tis, therefore, your Concern
not to give the least Countenance to these
Hopes.</P>
<P>My Inclinations are to be Kind and Indulg∣ing
to you all, I hope you will do nothing to
endanger the Loss of this Opportunity, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od hath put into our Hands, of Securing
Ourselves and all <HI>Europe;</HI> and that there
Will be no Contention amongst you; but who
shall most promote the Publick Wellfare.</P>
<P>Such a Temper as this, in all your Proceed∣ings,
cannot fail of Securing your Reputations
both at Home and Abroad.</P>
<P>This would make Me a happy Queen, whose
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
utmost Endeavour shall never be wanting to
make you a happy and flourishing People.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The History of these Things is not the
Business of this Tract, any farther, than, <HI>as
before,</HI> they concur to shew how <HI>Victory</HI>
Abroad and <HI>Union</HI> at Home kept Pace, and
went Hand in Hand together; we shall
have the Mortification, in its Turn, to tell
you, That as our <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> at Home
decay'd, and wore out, so our <HI>Successes</HI> Abroad
fell off and declin'd.</P>
<P>The last Year, famous for the Battle of
<HI>Blenheim;</HI> the Conquest of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Re∣covering
all that was lost in the Circle of
<HI>Swabia,</HI> ended with the Re-Taking the
strong Fortress of <HI>Landau;</HI> a Battle at Sea,
to our Advantage, in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI>
and with beginning the War in <HI>Spain</HI> under
King <HI>Charles</HI> III.</P>
<P>The next Year issued with no <HI>Victory,</HI> or
great Action of Moment, yet the <HI>French</HI>
weakned by the Ruin of their Affairs in <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI>
tho' they disappointed the Confede∣rates
on the <HI>Moselle,</HI> yet suffer'd an equal
Disappointment in their Enterprize on <HI>Ni∣meguen,</HI>
and had their Lines forced at the
End of the Campaign.</P>
<P>But the Year 1706, as it was the Meridi∣an
of our flourishing Affairs at Home, as to
<HI>Party, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of the People, so it
was the most glorious Year of <HI>Victory</HI> that the
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
Confederates ever saw, and the greatest Year
of Losses to <HI>France</HI> that ever any Empire in
the World could suffer, and yet remain un∣subdued;
for in the Beginning of this Year,
first on <HI>May</HI>-Day, to begin the Year, the
Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was Raised by the <HI>English</HI>
Succours coming thither, under the Com∣mand
of Two known Officers, the Earl of
<HI>Peterborow,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Lake,</HI> and the
Mareschal <HI>de Tesse</HI> oblig'd to make his Re∣treat,
in a desperate Manner, with the
<HI>French</HI> Army to <HI>Roses,</HI> leaving 150 Pieces
of Cannon and Mortars, 2500 Sick and
Wounded Men, and all his Ammunition
and Carriages behind him, Marching under
the particular Mortification of a very re∣markable
Eclipse of the Sun, which was pe∣culiarly
visible there; and the more Terri∣fying
as the Sun in its Splendor is the De∣vice
of the King of <HI>France,</HI> whose Glory,
that Year, suffer'd the greatest Eclipse that
had ever attended any Prince of this Age.</P>
<P>On the 12th of the same Month happen'd
the great Battle of <HI>Ramellies,</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
of which all our Histories are full, wherein
the Flower of all <HI>France,</HI> as to Forces, fell
in the Field, and which was follow'd by
the Taking of almost all <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Cities
of <HI>Brussels, Bruges, Antwerp, Ghene, Ma∣chlin,</HI>
and <HI>Lovain;</HI> the strong Towns of
<HI>Oestend, Menin, Courtray, Oudenard, Alost,
Dendermond,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41"/>
But, as if this had not been enough, the
Year ended with a Victory yet greater in its
Kind and Effects than all these, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Battle of <HI>Turin,</HI> wherein the Duke of <HI>Orle∣ans</HI>
was entirely overthrown, the Mareschal
<HI>Marsin</HI> killed, the Siege of <HI>Turin</HI> Raised, the
whole <HI>French</HI> Army defeated, 11000 Dra∣goons
Horses taken, 250 Pieces of Cannon
and Mortars, with all the Baggage, Tents,
Ammunition, Carriages, and Camp of the
<HI>French;</HI> and which Victory was follow'd
by the entire Loss of <HI>Italy</HI> by the <HI>French;</HI>
the Count <HI>de Medavy</HI> having capitulated to
quit all the Towns held in the Dutchy of
<HI>Milan,</HI> and on the <HI>Po,</HI> for Leave to with∣draw
the <HI>French</HI> Troops out of <HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P>It is not nay Business to descant here upon
these Great Things, but still to observe, That
this Meridian of our Victories Abroad was
just in the Meridian of our <HI>Union</HI> at Home;
and, that as <HI>Victory</HI> crown'd thus our Arms,
<HI>Universal Satisfaction</HI> crown'd our <HI>Councils,</HI>
by Beginning and Compleating the greatest
Transaction at Home that ever was brought
to a Head in this Nation, I mean <HI>the Union
with</HI> Scotland, which the next Session of
Parliament had the Felicity to encourage,
and to see finished,</P>
<Q><P>For it began in <HI>England,</HI> the 16th of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Was ended there, and the Articles pre∣sented
to Her Majesty the 23d of <HI>July:</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
Begun to be consider'd in the Parliament
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the 3d of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The Ratification Perfected, Voted, Ap∣prov'd,
Touch'd with the Royal <HI>Scep∣ter,</HI>
and, with Amendments, sent up to
the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> the 16th of
<HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>It pass'd the Parliament in <HI>England</HI> the
6th of <HI>March;</HI> and was pass'd by the
Queen the 19th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The Exemplification was sent down to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> received there, and the last
Parliament of that Kingdom Dissolved
the 28th of <HI>April,</HI> 1707.</P></Q>
<P>Happy would it be if I could say that our
<HI>Prosperity</HI> Abroad, as our <HI>Union</HI> at Home,
did not begin from henceforth to decline;
and indeed they seem'd in this, very much
to keep Pace, also, one with another. It is
true, the <HI>Successes</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in some
Measure continu'd, yet many <HI>Misfortunes</HI>
from other Parts, gave a Check to our <HI>Suc∣cesses,</HI>
as the Beating back King <HI>Charles</HI> the
III's Army in <HI>Spain</HI> from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the
Enemy Recovering all <HI>Castile;</HI> the Couping
up the Earl of <HI>Galloway</HI> with his Forces in
the little Province (tho' called a Kingdom)
of <HI>Valentia;</HI> and, at last, the fatal Battle of
<HI>Almanza,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Galway</HI> and the
<HI>English</HI> Army, tho' re-inforc'd by a great
Body of Troops from <HI>England,</HI> under
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
the Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> were not only beaten, but
entirely routed, and broken by the Duke of
<HI>Berwick;</HI> a Victory as compleat in its pro∣portion,
as ours was at <HI>Ramellies;</HI>—and
which was follow'd by the Loss of all <HI>Spain,</HI>
the City of <HI>Barcelona</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>The Loss of that famous Expedition of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and
Raising of the Siege of <HI>Tholoun,</HI> where the
Mareschal <HI>de Thesse</HI> effectually retriev'd the
Honour he lost at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and made him∣self
a full Amends upon the Confederates,
by Posting himself so in the Teeth of the
<HI>German</HI> Army, that Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> tho' al∣low'd
to be as Great a General as the World
has now to show, could neither attack him,
dislodge him, or carry on the Siege of the
Town without it; and so was oblig'd, shame∣fully
enough, to break up, and Retreat with
Loss and Dishonour.</P>
<P>In short, nothing, from this Time, suc∣ceded
but in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and tho' it is true,
that by the meer Strength of Arms and Su∣periority
of Forces, we carry'd very consi∣derable
Towns, such as <HI>Lisle, Tournay, Mons,
Doway, St. Venant, Aire,</HI> and <HI>Bouchain,</HI> and
fought Three Battles, as at <HI>Weynendale, Ou∣denard,</HI>
and <HI>Blaregnies,</HI> yet in all these <HI>Victo∣ries,</HI>
the first excepted, we got little but the
Honour of the Field; and the last was so de∣structive,
and ruinous a Victory, that such an∣other
would have broken the Troops past the
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
possibility of being quickly restor'd, having lost
above 22000 Men, upon the Field of Battle,
without any Advantage but the meer Name
of a <HI>Victory;</HI> and that of having beaten the
Enemy out of the Field of Battle; where, in
less than 14 Days, they came and encamp'd
again, even upon the same Spot.</P>
<P>The Conquests of the Towns also being
all made by desperate Sieges, and Defended
to the last Extremity; cost us so much
Blood, and so discouraged and dispirited our
Men, that in the last Campaign, upon the
very Naming a Siege, the Desertion of the
Men would be so great, that no Campaign,
since the War, has given Proof of the like,
which caus'd the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> to Publish
the severest Proclamation against his Sub∣jects
that should Desert, that was ever heard
of, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Noses should be cut off,
be declar'd Infamous, and be sent Home to
be kept in perpetual Imprisonment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In other Places I might give you an Ac∣count
of the Defeat of the <HI>Germans:</HI> Under
Count <HI>Mercy,</HI> by the Count <HI>du Bourg;</HI> on the
Upper <HI>Rhine;</HI> the Invasion in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
the like, which last, tho' it fail'd in Success,
yet had its evil Effects, not a few among us
here; add to these the second Year of Misfor∣tunes
in <HI>Spain;</HI> the second Beating of the
Confederates out of <HI>Castile;</HI> the Taking
<HI>Bribenga;</HI> the Battle of <HI>Villa Vicosa;</HI> the
Driving Count <HI>Starembergh</HI> back to his close
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
Quarters in <HI>Barcelona;</HI> Taking <HI>Balaguer,
Gironne,</HI> &amp;c. and to Crown all, our Miscar∣riage
at <HI>Canada;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>It remains to bring to your View the <HI>Un∣happy
Breaches, Divisions,</HI> and <HI>Party-Strife,</HI>
which influenc'd us at Home, during all
these Ruffles Abroad, to make good the Con∣nection
aforesaid; and shew how our <HI>Successes</HI>
Abroad have all along kept Pace with our good
<HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> among ourselves.</P>
<P>No sooner was the <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Scotland</HI>
finish'd, and both Nations expected the Fruits
of it should appear in the Temper of our Peo∣ple
at Home, but <HI>Court Interest, Faction, Am∣bition,
Jealousy,</HI> and <HI>Party-Quarrels</HI> divided
us, and brought both Nations into greater
<HI>Mischiefs, Heats, Quarrels,</HI> and furious <HI>Ani∣mosities</HI>
against one another, than ever they
were in before, since the <HI>Revolution.</HI> How∣ever,
as it belongs not to this Chapter to
enter upon the Unhappy History of the
Particulars, having design'd to state them at
large by themselves, I break off here with
Noting that, in Performance of this Scheme,
I shall let you see by what wretched Steps
this poor Nation was brought from her
<HI>Flourishing State,</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Union</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Posture we are now
seen in, <HI>viz. Confusion, Distrust</HI> of one
another, <HI>Jealousy</HI> of <HI>Parties, Animosity,
Personal Reproach,</HI> and every Thing that
fits a Nation for <HI>Ruin</HI> and <HI>Destruction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This Chapter contains an Abridgement
of the History of PARTIES among
us, deduced from their Introduction
into the State, from and after the
Union; and stated and brought down
as they now appear among us, to
the Time of Passing the Occasional
Bill, and therein Finishing the Ruin
of the Dissenters.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>UR last Chapter giving a
General Scheme of Things
before the <HI>Union</HI> of the
Two Kingdoms, <HI>viz.</HI> in what
Manner the Prosperity of
the Nation both began and
afterwards declin'd, it follows according to
the Method prescribed, that this Chapter
should enter more particularly into the De∣tail
of our <HI>Divisions, Parties,</HI> and <HI>Distracti∣ons</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
which immediately followed, and by
which it will more particularly appear by
what Steps we came to the present Condi∣tion
we are in, and to what Originals are
Owing the Heats, Fury,<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Animosities
which Reign among us.</P>
<P>The first remarkable Transaction which
happen'd at Court, after the <HI>Union,</HI> was an
open and irreconcileable Breach between the
Lord Treasurer, <HI>God</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>M</HI>—<HI>gh</HI> on one part, and the then Secreta∣ry
of State, Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> on the other: A begin∣ning
fruitful of Great Events, and which put
the whole Body of our Parties into a New
Ferment, till the Issue has produced many
and great Changes in both <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Mea∣sures,</HI>
and been indeed, the Original of all the
several Phenomena of <HI>Court Policies</HI> which
have happen'd since in either Kingdom, and
which has, more or less, affected every Branch
of the Government, and every Party among
the People; this may well be accounted an
<HI>Unhappy Occurrence,</HI> as it has Embroil'd the
Nation in many <HI>Disorders,</HI> and ended in the
Ruin, as to the Favour of their Prince, and
as to <HI>Publick Employment,</HI> of the whole <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI>
of that Time, as shall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>The Invasion made by the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
in behalf of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> with the
Consequences of that Expedition, not so
much Historically, as it respected the Ene∣my,
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
but Familiarly, as it respected our <HI>Civil
Broils,</HI> either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> may
be said to be an effect of this Mischief: For
so many wrong Steps were taken at Home,
by running upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> to the danger
of the <HI>Publick Credit;</HI> by bringing Pri∣soners
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> taken up, as was al∣ledg'd,
as Party and Affection, not real Rea∣son
and Danger directed, the bringing them
up as Criminals in Custody to <HI>England,</HI> and
then having nothing to say to them; and
many other Misterious Articled of Manage∣ment,
which had little to be said to defend
them, prov'd strongly, That the <HI>Publick</HI> was
in some strange Ferment, which would cer∣tainly
appear, and break but in a little time
as indeed it did, to the astonishment of <HI>Wise∣men,</HI>
the encouragement of the then <HI>Outed-Party</HI>
and the ruin of both the <HI>Contending-Interests.</HI></P>
<P>I am far from being of their Opinion, who
have frequently, and publickly, pretended to
wish, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> had Landed in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
or thought that it might have been bet∣ter
for us if it had been so; and I beg Leave
for a Digression on that needful Subject, tho'
it may be something long; such a Thought,
in Men who own and pretend to be for the
<HI>Present Establishment,</HI> (for if they speak as
<HI>Jacobites</HI> they alter the Case) can be rational,
upon no other Supposition than that of the
<HI>Invaders</HI> being easily conquer'd when they
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
should Land, which, say they, would not only
have put an End to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> by his in∣evitable
falling into our Hands; but would
eventually have been the Ruin of the <HI>Ja∣cobite</HI>
Interest in <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Overthrow
of the Party; and perhaps at last, the final
End of the <HI>High-Land</HI> Superiorities, which
at present, is the greatest Danger and Of∣fence
to the <HI>British Government,</HI> and which
has in it some Difficulties in the Constitu∣tion
by means of the <HI>Union,</HI> which the
<HI>Crown</HI> has no other Way ever to get the
Mastery of: This is as much as can be said
on that Head.</P>
<P>But, as such People are presum'd not to
have taken <HI>right Measures,</HI> or to have look'd
into the Dangers of other Kinds with which
such a <HI>Success</HI> would have been attended,
they are desired to consider a few of the fol∣lowing
Generals, all which were attended
with, particular Mischiefs; too many to be
enumerated.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Diversion to the Campaign then
just going to begin; the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough</HI>
being thought the only Man fit
to be Trusted with the Affair, and
about 22000 Men adjudg'd needful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The ruin of the Country, which, as
Measures must have been taken, wou'd
have been at least two Months in the
fiill Possession of the Enemy.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="41" REF="50"/>
3. The blow to <HI>Publick-Credit</HI> at Home,
which was too evident to need any Ex∣planation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The bringing Home the <HI>War</HI> to our
own Door, and making our own Fruit∣ful
Country the Seat of <HI>Desolation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The many Ways it would have an∣swer'd
the Ends of the King of <HI>France,</HI>
according to the Example of the <HI>Male-Contents</HI>
in <HI>Hungary,</HI> who, tho' they
have ruin'd their Country, and done
themselves no Good, have many Ways
serv'd the Interest of the <HI>French,</HI> who
for that purpose, at first somented their
Disorders.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>As for the probable Progress and Success,
which in the mean time, and before our
Army could have come up with them, we
having no Fortify'd <HI>Frontiers,</HI> no Place of
<HI>Arms,</HI> no Magazines of <HI>War-like Stores,</HI> or
Provision laid up there, we ought to have ex∣pected;
the Readeris referr'd to the following
Account, taken out of the Preface to the <HI>Hi∣story
of the late Union,</HI> and publish'd in <HI>Edin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>
the Year after the Invasion, where this Case
is spoken to at large, thus:</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, never was Nation in
such a Condition to be Invaded; and there
is no doubt but, had the <HI>French</HI> landed their
Forces, and got their Stores of Arms and Am∣munition
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
on Shore, as they might easily have
done, if they had not over-shot their Port,
they would with very little Opposition have
been Masters of the whole Country.</P>
<Q>It may be thought, by some, remote to my
Purpose, to demonstrate this; but when
I consider what different Notions the
People in <HI>England</HI> have of the Attempt
of the <HI>French,</HI> and their Success in it,
I cannot think it a useless Labour, to
give you a brief Essay, at what the Event
of that Enterprize might probably have
been,—that so we may see what we
have to be Thankful for, therefore I
proceed;</Q>
<P>I am now to suppose the <HI>French</HI> safe on
Shore; their <HI>Magazine</HI> and <HI>Train of Artil∣lery</HI>
Landed, and the Earl of <HI>Levin,</HI> the Ge∣neral
for Her Majesty, retreating towards
<HI>Berwick,</HI> as he must undoubtedly have done,
—and, as his Orders directed him to do;—
without which, his Retreat being cut off, he
must have been Surrounded and Taken, or
have been cut in Pieces, having no Place of
Strength to Retreat to.</P>
<P>Had they been thus on Shore, there is no
doubt, but in two Hours, that is, in a very short
Time, they had been Masters of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> an
open City, and without Defence: The Castle,
indeed, might have held out some time; but the
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
City could have made no Resistance.—But that
which was worse, the Circumstances of the Time
were such, and the People were so divided,
that the City must have sent down to <HI>Leith</HI>
to have sought Protection from the <HI>French</HI> a∣gainst
their own Rabbles; and they must have
desired the <HI>French</HI> to have come and taken
them into their Protection, to have preserv'd
them from Plunder and Confusion.</P>
<P>I think, whatever the Reasons of this were,
which I desire to bury in Silence, the Fact will
be readily granted; and indeed all Men own'd,
at that time, that if the <HI>French</HI> Landed their
Forces, they must be Masters of the City of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> without any Opposition.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that I am now but upon sugges∣tion,
and meer supposition; and I do not affirm
possitively; but I leave it to any Man to judge
of Probabilities, and whether, what I suggest
is Rational or no; when the <HI>French</HI> were
thus possess'd of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it is very rea∣sonable
to suppose that the first Thing they
would have done, was to Proclaim their King;
if the Magistrates of the City would not have
agreed to have performed the Ceremony; the
<HI>Tolbooth</HI> was near at Hand, and the Citi∣zens
being assembl'd would soon have chosen
New Magistrates, who would cheerfully have
done it—.</P>
<P>Their King being proclaim'd, it seems ra∣tional
to suppose they next should summon the
Inhabitants to take an Oath of Fidelity to
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
him; such as refus'd would have their Estates
Confiscated, and perhaps be Imprison'd; and
if they got room to fly would have their Houses
Plunder'd.</P>
<P>Being thus Masters of the Capital, and the
Queen's Troops having Fled, or Retreated to∣wards
<HI>Berwick,</HI> the Coutrey expos'd to their
Power; I think I make no Trespass on good
Manners or Justice, if I say the <HI>Northern
High-landers</HI> would have been rais'd by the
Authority of their Superiours, who were for
the most part <HI>Jacobites.</HI>—These being in
Arms, the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> are at their Mercy, and
they had soon possess'd themselves of the whole
Country, the Militia being entirely without a
Head, and without Order, unlock'd from the
former Settlement, and unfix'd in a New.</P>
<P>Being thus possess'd of the <HI>Low-Lands,</HI>
they soon would have been Masters of the
whole Country; and indeed there were very
few that durst shew their Faces against them,
the Forwardness of one Party, and the Dis∣orders
and Divisions of the other, making way
for it:—When they had thus reduced the
<HI>Low-Lands,</HI> they had no more to do then to call
a <HI>Convention of Estates,</HI> as at the <HI>Revolu∣ton,</HI>
and finding these fast to their Interest; the
First Case would be to recind the <HI>Revolution;</HI>
declare the <HI>limited Succession</HI> a <HI>visible Re∣bellion,</HI>
and invading the <HI>Right</HI> of another;
and thus a compleat National Turn would
have pass'd upon us; and the <HI>Revolution</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
should suffer a <HI>Re-revolution</HI> in a few Weeks:
These Things would require but little time,
neither is it Presumption to suppose they should
have gotten a Representative return'd, that
would have come into such Measures; since
they having the absolute Possession of the Coun∣try,
the influencing them under such Circum∣stances,
to the choosing of such Persons as
they shall think fit to put upon them, was easie
enough: Instances of which have been but
too common in this Island, under a less Tyran∣nical
Power than a <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>While they were thus settling their <HI>Civil Go∣vernment,</HI>
—their <HI>Military Affairs</HI> would not
have fail'd; the Inclination of the Comon Peo∣ple
about <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Influence of
the Chiefs and Heads of <HI>Clans</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands,</HI>
would have soon furnish'd Men for a
<HI>New-Revolution;</HI>—the Sixteen Regiments
which they brought with them (so it seems
they had determin'd) should have had 200
Men added to every Regiment, by way of fill∣ing
up,—Five Regiments of Dragoons, and
Forty Battalions of Foot, were to have been
rais'd immediately—; the Command of these
Troops was to be given <HI>Irish</HI> Officers, and of
such they brought great Numbers with them;
save only that the Colonels, and some Captains
were to be chosen of the Superiors, or Chiefs,
where they were rais'd, to Encourage the
raising them.</P>
<P>Thus, in less than Six Weeks, they shou'd
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
have had 30000 Men added to the Troops
they brought with them—the Money
they would have given the <HI>High-land</HI> Gentle∣men,
would effectually have brought these
Gentlemen to for sake their Prince and join
with them; and thus the Design would have
gone on beyond Expectation.</P>
<P>We are next to enquire, what was to be∣come
of the <HI>English</HI> Preparation all this
while? You have beard what Strength they
were of, when come together; but it could
not be possible they could all be brought to∣gether,
their Magazines furnish'd (for the
<HI>French,</HI> would have taken care they should
have subsisted ill enough in <HI>Scotland,</HI>) their
<HI>Train of Artillery</HI> have been come up, and
they in Condition to have march'd into <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
in Battalia, as they must have done, un∣der
six Weeks or two Months—the
Difficuties of the Roads, the Country being
at that time very deep, and the Carriages
heavy, should have made it very bad march∣ing
an Army—and the Want of For∣rage
would have made it impracticable to
have done it sooner.</P>
<P>All this time the <HI>French Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
would have had, to have steengthen'd
their <HI>New Settlement,</HI> form'd their <HI>Army,</HI>
fortify'd <HI>Leith</HI> and other Places, and have
prepar'd for <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P>I shall readily grant, as any-Body can de∣sire,
That when the <HI>English</HI> Army came to
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
be ready, and enter <HI>Scotland,</HI> they should
Beat these <HI>New-Invaders</HI> out of all; and
that they should, in time, pay Dear for the
Attempt; but it must be granted, this would
have these Consequences withal: (1.) That
it would have ruin'd <HI>Scotland;</HI> (2.) brought
the Seat of War Home to our own Doors;
(3.) caused a Diversion of our Forces, and been
an Occasion of withdrawing our Troops from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Enemy felt the greatest
Weight of the War, and (4.) have exceed∣ingly
protracted the War. Those Gentle∣men
that were for having them Land, may
consult these probable Consequences, and
they will see whether they have not very
good reason to be sensible of the Happiness
of the Disappointment.</P>
<P>Thus far was observ'd then upon, the
Spot, and, indeed, the Condition of <HI>England</HI>
concurr'd to make it rational; for the <HI>Train</HI>
of <HI>Artillery,</HI> and <HI>Stores for War,</HI> were not
to be ventur'd by Sea, so as to have the Ar∣my
to march without them; they were or∣der'd
from the <HI>Tower,</HI> and it was Twenty
Days e'er the Officers propos'd to be ready;
the Badness of the Roads, and the Length
of the Way was such that they could not
possibly be supposed to arrive at <HI>Berwick</HI>
under 20 Days more, all which Time must
have been spent before, the Army could have
set their, Foot into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="57"/>
But I leave this, and believe it is enough
demonstrated, and therefore the Nation
cannot but be sensible, that the whole was
a happy Deliverance from Heaven; and this
Nation had much better have employ'd
their Management in Giving Thanks for
Escaping from that, and putting themselve
in a Posture to prevent the like, than to fall
into <HI>Parties,</HI> as they did, to such a Degree,
as that the Enemy have since had Oppor∣tunities
to do the like, without an Army, ra∣ther
than any Occasion to send another.</P>
<P>This was that fatal Breach between the
<HI>Antients</HI> and the <HI>Moderns,</HI> as it was wittily
called at that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> between the <HI>Old-Whiggs</HI>
and the <HI>New-Whiggs,</HI> or to speak
more plainly, between the <HI>juncto,</HI> or <HI>Whigg
Lords,</HI> and the <HI>Ministry;</HI> By the <HI>Juncto,</HI> to
explain the Word once for all, were then
understood the E—s of <HI>Sun</HI>—<HI>d, Or—d,</HI>
and <HI>Wha</HI>—<HI>on,</HI> the Lords <HI>Som</HI>—<HI>s</HI> and
<HI>Hal</HI>—<HI>x,</HI> and some eminent Commoners;
these associated, for this Occasion only, with
a Party of the like Kidney, <HI>That Word being
taken modernly for Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
had, for some Years past, been known there
by the Distinction of the <HI>Flying-Squadron,</HI>
or in their own Language <HI>the Squadroni.</HI></P>
<P>It remains pretty much a Mistery to this
Day, why these Two Parties, we mean the
<HI>Ministry</HI> and the <HI>Juncto,</HI> fell out, and the
utmost Discovery that we can arrive to in
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
that Case, tho' after nice Enquiry, amounts
to no more than the violent Inclination of
the Latter to come into the Administration;
and tho' I am very backward to say any
Thing to the Reproach of those Gentlemen
who were call'd the <HI>Juncto,</HI> who were al∣ways
esteem'd Persons of Honour; yet the
Freedom with which they laid down all
their Complaints and Pretensions, when
they were taken into the said <HI>Ministry;</HI> the
Certainty that they alter'd nothing of
the Abuses complain'd of, after they were
brought in; the little Concern they shew'd
for their Allies and Friends who had espou∣sed
them against the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and who they
left expos'd for it, with several other Steps
taken by those Gentlemen in the subsequent
Part of their Conduct, make a full Defence
for the aforesaid Suggestion, of their having
no other kind in the <HI>Breaches</HI> aforesaid, but
their own <HI>Advancement.</HI></P>
<P>How far they pursued their Complaints
on either Side; to what Height they went;
how they were at last reconcil'd, and car∣ry'd
on the Publick Affairs in Concert;
how they laid, in the said former Feuds, the
Foundation of Restoring a <HI>Party,</HI> who Vi∣gilant
to take Advantages from these Com∣motions,
broke in upon them, and over-turn'd
them Both; These melancholly Truths will
necessarily come to be enlarg'd upon in the
ensuing Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="59"/>
In the Process of this Management we
come next to observe, That the <HI>High-Flying</HI>
Clergy, finding the Nation weaken'd by
their private Dissentions; the Interest of the
<HI>Ministry</HI> not the same among the People as
it used to be; and especially, Declining with
the Queen; an Alteration, perhaps, as much
Owing to the Impolitick Stiffness, not to
say Rudeness, of One Old <HI>She Favourite,</HI>
as to all the Insinuations and Aggressions of
the <HI>New:</HI> The <HI>High-Flying</HI> Interest, as we ob∣serv'd,
finding it now their Time to strike,
prepar'd their Measures with the utmost Si∣lence
and Cunning; they had, indeed, given
Signals of their concerted Designs by all
possible, but private Hints, such as, That
now was the Time for the Friends of the
<HI>Church</HI> to exert themselves; that the
<HI>Church</HI> would have one Blow yet for it;
and that her Enemies did not know her
Strength; and to that length they came,
that a little before the Meeting of the Par∣liament,
1710, they caused an Advertise∣ment
to be publish'd in the Prints, and in∣dustriously
spread about, signifying to the
Clergy, <HI>That now was the Time to exert
themselves for the Service and Interest of
the</HI> Church. The unwary Town took little
Notice of this Advertisement; but those
People who were let into the Secret took
Care to let their Friends know the Mean∣ing
of it; and the whole Nation, soon after,
found it in the Effects.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="60"/>
The first Thing which possibly encou∣raged
them in the Prospects they had of
giving a Turn to the State of Affairs, lay
in this, That the <HI>Juncto</HI> and <HI>Whiggs</HI> na∣med
before, in their last unaccountable Step
relating to the <HI>Ministry,</HI> had introduced, into
the Houses of Parliament many of their
Friends, for those Gentlemen had made no
Scruple to Vote for the most open <HI>High-Flyers,</HI>
nay, even for known <HI>Jacobites,</HI> pro∣vided
only, that they would but joyn in
keeping Out the Men who were in the
Interest of the Court; albeit, those <HI>Court
Whiggs</HI> were otherwise, as true to the <HI>Re∣volution
Principle</HI> as themselves, and known
by them to be so; but this was not all, for
they not only brought many such in who
it was never in their Power, since that
Time, to throw out; but they thereby di∣vided
and amused the People in other Pla∣ces,
so that they were less steady in their
Voting for <HI>Honest Men;</HI> being amus'd and
bewilder'd, not knowing to Day who was
to be accounted an <HI>Honest Man</HI> to Morrow;
so that when the other Interest, in subse∣quent
Elections, began to put forward, the
<HI>Whiggs</HI> sound the People loose, their Interest
broken, and the <HI>Free-holders</HI> Choosing, the
<HI>Tories,</HI> by the very Example which the
<HI>Whiggs</HI> had given them the Sesson before.</P>
<P>It was in vain for a <HI>Whigg</HI> to argue with
a poor Honest <HI>Free-holder,</HI> or to press him
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
not to Vote for Sir <HI>W</HI>—<HI>m,</HI> but for Mr.—
as the Honester Man, the other being a <HI>Ja∣cobite;</HI>
when the poor Man could answer,
<HI>L</HI>—<HI>d, Sir, you told me last time, Sir</HI> W—m
<HI>was a very Honest Gentleman, and Mr.</HI>—
<HI>was a Mercenary Courtier; and you made me
Vote for Sir</HI> W—m; <HI>and now you tell me
Sir</HI> William <HI>was for the</HI> Pretender, <HI>and that
Mr.—is a very Honest Gentleman;
what must I do?</HI>—The upshot was, the
<HI>Free-holder</HI> having been bidden to Vote for
the <HI>High-Flyer</HI> before, does it now without
bidding, and cannot be brought off from it;
and this, together with the Vigilance of the
other People, over-threw their <HI>Election,</HI> and
lost the Day, almost over the whole Nation.</P>
<P>This unhappy Truth is recorded, not so
much to reproach those Gentlemen with the
Mistake they made in their Conduct, at that
time, as to hint to them the evil Consequen∣ces,
and warn them from the like Measures
in their subsequent Behaviour, and the Ma∣nagement,
both of themselve and their
Friends.</P>
<P>For not only were the People who had,
for Two Parliaments before stuck Close to
their Interests, been made <HI>Wavering,</HI> and
<HI>Inconstant,</HI> by seeing their Patriots act <HI>Fast</HI>
and <HI>Loose</HI> in their own Affairs: But the vi∣gilant
<HI>Clergy</HI> who had, as above, been warn∣ed
to hold themselve ready for some Great
Advantage, fell in with the Occasion, and
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
improving these inconsistent Practices
the common People, fill'd their Heads with
Apprehensions of Designs against the <HI>Queen</HI>
and the <HI>Church,</HI> and rais'd such a Tempest
of <HI>High-Church Faction,</HI> that when it broke
out, carry'd down all before it.</P>
<P>Now, altho' Things ripen'd apace for the
Confusions which follow'd, yet the more
immediate Occasion, upon which to set the
Wheels into motion, was not concluded on,
till Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> (a Name eagerly cry'd up,
for a time, and since as willingly forgotten)
in a Sermon on the 5th of <HI>November,</HI> 1710,
at St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> broke the Way; whether
forward in the general <HI>Heat</HI> that possess'd
the <HI>Clergy;</HI> whether in the Course of his
usual <HI>Railery;</HI> or, whether by Concert of
the <HI>Party,</HI> is a Secret not of Moment enough.
to have employ'd any Heads to enquire.</P>
<P>It needs not to enter here into so well
known a History as that of his <HI>Sermon,</HI> or of
the Lord Mayor foolishly <HI>Espousing it,</HI> and
cowardly <HI>Denying it</HI> afterwards in the <HI>House
of Commons,</HI> for which he was both Ways
expos'd, and became the most despis'd Thing
by both Sides that Has lately been heard of;
nor is it worth while to give here the Mi∣nutes
of his publick <HI>Prosecutton, Tryal, De∣fence,
Sentence,</HI> &amp;c. It may suffice to hint only
a few Things, for the sake of which only, a
Name so Contemptible gets a Place in this
Tract.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="63"/>
The <HI>Sermon</HI> was, to the highest Degree,
<HI>Insolent, Unmannerly, Untrue</HI> in <HI>Substance;</HI>
and what, as no Man of Modesty, or in his
Senses, wou'd have done, so no Man ought
to be suffer'd, unpunish'd, to have done it.
But the Resenting it so far, as to bring it to an
<HI>Impeachment</HI> in <HI>Parliament,</HI> and pursu'd with
all the solemnity of a <HI>Tryal,</HI> by the Highest
<HI>Judicature</HI> in the Nation, was the only Step
which ruin'd the Case; open'd the Door to
all the Scheme laid, as above; made the <HI>Man</HI>
popular, and his <HI>Cause</HI> be no more his, bpt
the <HI>Case of the Church and Party</HI> against the
<HI>Whiggs</HI> and the <HI>Ministry;</HI> and thus this
<HI>Trisle</HI> was made the <HI>Inroduction</HI> to all the
Mischiefs that ensu'd, and open'd the Door
for the greatest Revolution of Affairs that
had happen'd from the coming in of the
Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>I am not of the Opinion that some enter∣tain,
<HI>viz.</HI> That secret Hands subtilly push'd
the <HI>late Ministry</HI> on to the Precipitation
aforesaid; whereas, they ought only to have
taken the usual Notice of such Things, <HI>viz.</HI>
Order'd it to have been Burnt by the <HI>Hang∣man;</HI>
the <HI>Sermon</HI> voted <HI>Seditious,</HI> and the
<HI>Preacher Scandalous;</HI> and then there had
been an end of it: But, however, this might
have been the Wiser way, as Things after∣wards
fell out. I cannot see how it was in
the least to be expected, that the <HI>Ministry</HI>
could foresee the Consequence, all which
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
was owing to the Unsteadiness of a certain
Number of those, who, as they came into the
first <HI>Measures, viz.</HI> of the <HI>Prosecution,</HI> so if
they had adher'd to their first Notions of it,
might have effectually clench'd that <HI>Prose∣cution:</HI>
But now they not only Defeated the
Party <HI>Prosecuting,</HI> but, if some say true, In∣fluenced
<HI>some-body</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Crimi∣nal:</HI>
Whether this be so or not, this seems to
be most certain, that had a Sentence been past
in any measure suitable to the Circumstan∣ces
of the <HI>Man,</HI> and Nature of the <HI>Crime;</HI>
had the <HI>Person</HI> been degraded as a <HI>Scanda∣lous
Fellow,</HI> as even his own Party acknow∣leg'd
him to be; had the <HI>House</HI> express'd
the same Detestation of the <HI>Crime,</HI> after the
<HI>Verdict,</HI> as they did before; had they
disabled him, Imprison'd him, or any other way
severely Punish'd him, he had never been
Caress'd by the <HI>Rabble,</HI> Sainted, Worship'd,
and at last bloated up with <HI>Pride</HI> to such an
Excess, as to make his own <HI>Friends</HI> asham'd
of him; nor had a <HI>Seditious Sermon</HI> had
such prodigious Effect all over this Nation,
as it had.</P>
<P>But the Nation was fill'd wth a Com∣plication
of <HI>Disorders</HI> and <HI>Dissatisfactions,</HI>
and, like as a Body full of Humours, sinks
under the first little Hurt it receives, which
at another time would he of no values; the
whole Flux of <HI>Politick Discontent;</HI> the Hu∣mours
of the <HI>National Body,</HI> gave themselves
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
vent here: The People who were ripen'd
for <HI>Tumult,</HI> took Fire like Gunpowder, at the
least Sparkle among them, and therefore it
is not to be wonder'd at, if abundance of
Inconsistant and Incongruous Steps were ta∣ken
by those who were not let into the
Secret, but were manag'd by those who
were.</P>
<P>It is evident, the Affair of <HI>Sacheverell</HI> was
an accident, as it related to the Consequences
that were produced from it, and the <HI>Party</HI>
that afterwards espous'd it, who, knowing no∣thing
at first of the Measures that after∣wards
were taken, yet fell in, Unanimously,
with the Occasion that was given, and made
it serve their Purposes, as well as if it had
been of their own Contrivance. The <HI>Pro∣secution</HI>
of a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> gave an extraordi∣nary
handle to those who had been long en∣deavouring
to revive the Old successless
Notion of <HI>the Danger of the Church;</HI> they
easily insinuated into the Heads of the Ig∣norant
Vulgar, that the Crime for which he
was Prosecuted, was <HI>Trifling</HI> and <HI>Frivolous;</HI>
and that tho' he had been rash, and might have
let fall some inconsiderate Words, it was be∣low
the whole Body of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and not
worth while to embark the <HI>Government</HI> in
such a formal <HI>Prosecution,</HI> for a few Hot
Words of a <HI>Parish-Parson;</HI> that if they had
had no other Design, than to have humbled
the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>House of Commons</HI> cou'd
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
have Voted it <HI>Insolent</HI> and <HI>Scandalous,</HI> as it
really was, and have brought him upon his
Knees at the Bar of the <HI>House;</HI> which had
been Mortification enough, to him, and in
which no-Body wou'd have Oppos'd them,
but the Carrying on the <HI>Prosecution</HI> to the
Heighth they did, made it evident, That
the Design was of greater Consequence;
that the whole <HI>Clergy</HI> were concern'd in it;
that the <HI>Church</HI> itself was <HI>aim'd at;</HI> that
the <HI>Whiggs</HI> had been long in Confederacy
to clip the Wings of the <HI>Ecclesiasticks,</HI> and
to have reduc'd the <HI>Church of England</HI> to a
Comprehension with, if not a Subjection to
<HI>Presbyterianism,</HI> and the <HI>Fanaticks;</HI> and that
therefore it behov'd the whole Body of the
People of <HI>England,</HI> if they wou'd prevent the
Ruin of the <HI>Church,</HI> to appear, and stand up
for this Case of Doctor <HI>Sacheverell.</HI></P>
<P>The Success they gain'd in the Tryal, ad∣ded
to the Easiness of the People's Temper
at that time, to receive suitable Impressions,
as is before noted, made these Arguments
the more popular, and brought the Mobb
about the <HI>Criminal,</HI> whom they attended to
and from the Place of Tryal with Shouts and
Huffa's, as to a Triumph; erecting him, up∣on
all Occasions, as a <HI>Martyr</HI> for the <HI>Church;</HI>
the <HI>Innocent Mobb</HI> suffer'd themselves, in do∣ing
this, to be impos'd upon by those Peo∣ple
who subtilly, and for the Ends aforesaid,
had encourag'd 'em to come together, and to
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
behurry'd on to commit several Violences and
Insults upon the <HI>Publick Peace,</HI> such, as even
the <HI>Party</HI> themselve, nor the <HI>Government</HI> af∣terwards,
tho' gotten into their Kinds, cou'd
either justify, nor support them in, such as
pulling Down the <HI>Meeting-Houses,</HI> insuiting
the Dwelling-Houses of the <HI>Dissnting-Mini∣sters,</HI>
threatning to plunder the <HI>Bank,</HI> and
the like.</P>
<P>But the Party who, as before, had subtil∣ly
laid hold of these Things to serve the
Purposes which they secretly design'd, tho'
they suffer'd these Rabblings to go on in
several Parts of the Kingdom, yet they ra∣ther
serv'd their present Occasion from them,
in order to prosecute the Schemes of a <HI>Revo∣lution,</HI>
which follow'd after, than either ap∣prov'd
of, or supported them: The first Use
they made of it, was to perswade <HI>Some-body,</HI>
that the general Bent of the Nation was to
be judg'd of by these <HI>Popular Commotions,</HI>
and that the <HI>Government</HI> ought to steer, in
some Measures, by that Rule in the future
Management of the <HI>Publick-Affairs;</HI> that the
<HI>Ministry</HI> then in being, were grown Odious
to the People, and could not support them∣selves,
when another Parliament should once
come to be elected; that all wise <HI>Governments</HI>
took their aim from, and measured Things
by the general Bent of the <HI>Inclinations</HI> of
the <HI>People,</HI> and that, in this Case, Things
were come to that length, that if some Steps
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
were not taken, in compliance with the pre∣sent
Temper of the Times, some Danger
might be apprehended, and the real <HI>Oppres∣sions</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> which the People were
now made so sensible of, inight cause <HI>Nature</HI>
to rebel against <HI>Principle,</HI> and produce some
Effects fatal to the present Establishment:
By these Artifices the Change of the <HI>Mini∣stry</HI>
was brought to pass in the first Place,
which took up some Time in the Manage∣ment;
and the People were left in suspence,
as to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> whether it should con∣tinue
or no; the <HI>Managers,</HI> who had found
the Rabble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so useful, at <HI>London,</HI> in the Af∣fair
aforesaid, made use of this Time, to try
their Strength all over the Kingdom, and
finding the People possess'd with the same
<HI>Madness</HI> in the Country, they were too
Wise to slip the Opportunity of getting a
Parliament Chosen under the Influence of
the <HI>Popular Fermentation.</HI></P>
<P>As an Introduction to this, they set their
Agents to work to get Addresses from all
Parts of the Kingdom to the Queen, tacite∣ly
Inviting Her Majesty to Dissolve the
<HI>Parliament,</HI> and loudly Boasting of their
powerful Endeavours in the Election of a
<HI>New;</HI> and that the Connection of their
Actions may more plainly appear, they pre∣tended
to ground the <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the
<HI>Parliament</HI> upon those <HI>Popular Addresses,</HI>
and the general Opinion of the People ex∣press'd
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
thereby; and the Proclamation for
Dissolving the Parliament is calculated to
signify the same Thing in these Words:</P>
<P>And to the Intent our good Subjects may
perceive the Confidence we have in the Assu∣rances
they have given us of their Duty and
Affection, and how desirous we are to meet
our People, and have their Advice by their
Representatives in Parliament, We do here∣by
make known to our said Subjects, That We
do intend, in some short Time, to give Di∣rections
to our Chancellour of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
to cause Writs to be issued in Form of Law
for the Calling a <HI>New Parliament.</HI> [Vide
<HI>Proclamation the 21st of</HI> Sept. 1710.]</P>
<P>These Observations upon the Affair of
<HI>Sacheverell</HI> are made the more particular,
that Posterity may receive a true Notion
how these Things were tranfacted, and how
far this little, but popular Article was
made the Introduction of the great <HI>Revolu∣tions</HI>
and <HI>Changes</HI> that happen'd in the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Court: Any one that looks narrowly
into these Affairs will easily be satisfy'd, that
these Observations are just, especially when
they look into the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>
and the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and of all the Par∣ty
which carry'd on these Transactions, as
it respects the Person of the said <HI>Sacheverell,</HI>
whom they never after regarded, gave the
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
least Reward to, or took any Notice; of, but
let him drop as a Tool which, tho' they had
thought sit to make Use of, they had no
Manner of Respect for, and have many Rea∣sons
to be asham'd of; they that question
this, as very few do, do need no more than
enquire of the Doctor himself, who being
disappointed of the mighty Things which
his Vanity made him believe he had Me∣rit
to deserve, loudly enough Complains
of it; they may further be satisfy'd by Ob∣serving,
that you find him now mention'd
in no Company, but all the Persons of Qua∣lity
and Sense endeavour, as much as possi∣ble,
to forget his very Name; and far from
Drinking his Health coupled with the
Queen's, as, while it served the <HI>Popular
Turn,</HI> they had the Folly to do: If any
Man has the Indescretion to name him with a
Glass, 'tis generally put by with a Hand and
this Proverbial Saying, <HI>Prithee plague us no
more with that Fellow; name some-body elfe.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to a New Scene of
Affairs, the Parliament is chosen, and the
Addressers, <HI>perhaps the first Instance of that
Kind,</HI> very well Kept their Word with the
Queen, and return'd the very Men they
pretended to: The <HI>Whiggs</HI> are universally
thrown out, a few Places excepted, where
their governing Interest render'd it imposs∣ble;
the Tumultuous Manner of Elections,
in most Parts of the Kingdom, but in the
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> especially,
dispirited and discouraged the <HI>Whiggs</HI> so,
that they declin'd to appear, or to defend
their own Interest and Party As they us'd
to do; even in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by a Management
very particular, a Set of Men were return'd
quite different from those who had had
the Leading Interest in that Country for
many Years past; the Elections there being
manag'd, as well as in <HI>England,</HI> not by the
<HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Influence</HI> of the <HI>Party</HI> itself, but
by such as were come over to 'em, from
what View and with what Prospects, it is
needless here to enlarge upon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Management</HI> being thus
changed, and a <HI>House of Commons</HI> sorted and
returned in the Manner aforesaid, we need
not say what was expected from them by
all Sorts of People: The <HI>Whiggs,</HI> in general,
apprehended no less than a <HI>Universal Over∣throw</HI>
of the <HI>Constitution; Confederacy</HI> with
<HI>France;</HI> and a Bringing in of the <HI>Pretender:</HI>
The <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as such, grew perfectly dis∣consolate
of the <HI>Toleration,</HI> while the <HI>Ja∣cobites</HI>
wanted Temper to contain them∣selves,
even so much as their own Interest
required; nor was the Fears of the <HI>Whiggs</HI>
and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ill-grounded at all, if
we were to allow them to take their Mea∣sures
from the Boasts of their Enemies, who
had so little Government of themselves, as
is said above, to own their Expectations and
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
Assurances of the Restoration of their <HI>Party</HI>
by this new Turn of <HI>Affairs;</HI> nay, so weak
had some of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> been, especially
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to declare, That they ex∣pected
that the <HI>Approaching Parliament,</HI> with
Consent of the Queen, should recognize
the <HI>Right</HI> of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> that Her Ma∣jesty
should acknowledge Herself unwilling
to keep him any longer from his <HI>Lawful
Possession,</HI> and should move the <HI>Parliament</HI>
to re-call him.</P>
<P>But the Event of Things soon unriddl'd
all these <HI>Misteries,</HI> and whatever Com∣plaints
had been made of the Conduct of
<HI>Persons,</HI> of <HI>Mismanagement, Misapplication,</HI>
&amp;c. it appear'd evident, That the grand De∣sign
of all was rather Changing the <HI>Men</HI>
than the <HI>Measures;</HI> Deposing the <HI>Instru∣ments</HI>
of <HI>Government,</HI> not the <HI>Government</HI>
itfelf; so that, after the first Hurries were
over, the Management of Things return'd
into the same <HI>Channel,</HI> and were left stand∣ing
upon the same Foundations as they
were before; all Things were transacted up∣on
the Foot of the <HI>Revolution;</HI> the <HI>Esta∣blish'd
Protestant Succession</HI> particularly es∣poused,
and more than common <HI>Applications</HI>
made to the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> to perswade
'em to believe, that this <HI>Ministry</HI> was more∣in
their <HI>Interest,</HI> and would more concern
themselve to establish it in the Hearts of
the <HI>People</HI> than ther <HI>Last.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="73"/>
This is particularly noticed here because,
upon all publick Occasions, <HI>Speeches</HI> and
<HI>Prints,</HI> relating either to carrying on the
<HI>War</HI> Abroad, or supporting <HI>Credit,</HI> and rai∣sing
<HI>Money</HI> at Home, occasion had been taken
to reflect upon the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the <HI>late Mini∣stry.
First,</HI> as to the <HI>War,</HI> That they had
been particularly careful to push Things in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> in Complement to the Duke of
<HI>Marlborough,</HI> placing the Sum of Affairs
on the Forces under his Command; neg∣lecting,
at the same Time, the War in <HI>Spain,</HI>
where, as they pretended, it should have
been more particularly pursued. This is evi∣dent,
not only from the <HI>Publick Speeches</HI> and
<HI>Pamplets,</HI> dispers'd about on that Occasion,
but also from Her Majesty's Speech to the <HI>Par∣liament,</HI>
wherein are the following Words:</P>
<P>The carrying on the <HI>War</HI> in all its Parts,
but particularly in <HI>Spain,</HI> with the utmost
Vigour, is the likeliest Means, with God's
Blessing, to procure a Safe and Honourable
<HI>Peace</HI> for us and all our <HI>Allies.</HI> [Vide
<HI>Queen's Speech the 14th of</HI> Novemb. 1710.]</P>
<P>From these <HI>Words,</HI> seconded by the Concur∣ing
<HI>Addresses</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> what could
<HI>Europe</HI> expect less, than that the greatest
Part of the <HI>British Forces</HI> should have been
re-called from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and sent into <HI>Spain,</HI>
the like with respect to the <HI>Publick Credit;</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
and the <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> made use, of by
the <HI>Late Ministry,</HI> for the Railing Money for
the carrying on the <HI>War;</HI> the Way of bor∣rowing
of <HI>Loans</HI> upon <HI>Funds</HI> have been ex∣ploded,
and cry'd down as Ruinous and
Destructive to the Nation, and the <HI>Late Mi∣nistry</HI>
reproach'd till the Intailing an Eternal
and Insupportable weight of Debt upon our
<HI>Posterity,</HI> by which they would be entirely
disabled from making <HI>War</HI> with any-body,
for One Hundred Years to come, tho' it
were never so much in their own Defence,
unless they should have so much <HI>Wit</HI> more
than <HI>Honesty,</HI> as not to think themselves
bound to make it good, as it is noted above
in the Case of the <HI>War,</HI> that the People ex∣pected
a <HI>New-Seal;</HI> so, in the Case of <HI>Money,</HI>
these Things made the People expect, that
the Taxes, for the Future, should be rais'd
by some other way; but when the <HI>New Mi∣nistry</HI>
came to act, all these <HI>Chimera</HI>'s vanish'd,
the <HI>Scots Jacobites,</HI> who, as is noted above,
expected their Members should have little
more to do in <HI>Parliament,</HI> but to Recognize,
and Restore the <HI>Pretender,</HI> saw those very
Members nominated, by the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI>
to be of the Committee appointed to draw
up their first Address to the <HI>Queen,</HI> assuring
Her Majesty- of their Resolution ro stand by
Her against all Her <HI>Enemies</HI> at <HI>Home</HI> and
<HI>Abroad,</HI> and of their adhering steadily to the
<HI>Protestant Succession</HI> in the <HI>Illustrious House
of Honover.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="75"/>
<HI>As to the War,</HI> they were so far from
altering their Measures that were taken be∣fore,
or from diminishing the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
or encreasing that in <HI>Spain,</HI> that, instead
of drawing off Troops from the Duke of
<HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Army, several Regiments of
Foot and Dragoons were sent thither from
<HI>Britain;</HI> nor were there any new Forces
sent from hence to <HI>Spain,</HI> except such as
were newly Hired of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> or had
been resolv'd, or appointed to be sent there
by the <HI>Old Ministry;</HI> so that the Duke of
<HI>Argyle,</HI> who was named for that <HI>Service,</HI>
and who thought to have appear'd there,
something like the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> found himself in no other Sta∣tion,
not in any better Condition than Mr.
<HI>Stanhope</HI> had been in before him. As to
the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> and <HI>Raising of Money,</HI> the
Case was entirely the same; for the <HI>Ministry,</HI>
far from pretending to Raise the <HI>Immense
Sums</HI> which the pressing <HI>Occasions</HI> of the
<HI>War</HI> call'd for, found themselve necessitated
to go on in the <HI>Old way,</HI> and Raise the <HI>Money</HI>
by the same <HI>Measures,</HI> such as <HI>Fundss, Loans,
Lotteries,</HI> &amp;c. just as others have done
before them.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Year 1711, when a new
and unexpected Scene of Affairs appear'd
upon the Stage; the unriddling the Mistery
whereof must not only lead us into <HI>Things</HI>
not altogether unknown to most People,
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
but wonderfully mistaken on every Side;
where we shall see the <HI>Unhappy People</HI> of
this Age, not only run into <HI>Errors</HI> and
Mistakes, but so Obstinate and Tenatious, as
to break out into all sorts of <HI>Violence</HI> one at
another, upon Questions little Understood,
and of no great Consequence, if they had
been explain'd; this relates to the <HI>Treaty of
Peace,</HI> set on Foot this Year, <HI>with France,</HI>
and which will be known to the Ages to
come by the Title of <HI>The Treaty of</HI> Utrecht.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministry,</HI> who had seen the Difficul∣ty,
the last Year, of <HI>Raising Money,</HI> and the
Struggle of the <HI>Contrary Party</HI> to make it yet
more Difficult for the Time to come, knew
very well, that a Want either of <HI>Funds</HI> to
Borrow upon, or of <HI>Credit</HI> to Borrow; by,
both which, upon any return of a <HI>Whiggish</HI>
Majority, might easily be interrupted, would
sink them; and on the other Hand sensible,
that tho' they had now a <HI>Parliament</HI> to their
Minds, yet that they were not sure that they
should always be able to keep the Interest
that they had gain'd upon the <HI>common People,</HI>
whom they knew Fluctuating and Uncertain
in their Tempers, and who might, by some
unforeseen Accident, be turn'd as violently
against them, as they were now for them;
and that any such Turn might hazard the
plunging the <HI>Ministry</HI> into Inextricable Dif∣faculties,
and so drive the <HI>Sovereign</HI> to the
unavoidable Necessity of changing Hands a
third Time.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="77"/>
These Things being apparent, and the
<HI>Ministry too Wise not to see into it,</HI> put them
upon considering of Means for Establishing
themselves in the <HI>Administration,</HI> without
being put to the hazard of the Difficulties
aforesaid: It was easie to perceive, that there
was but one Way to do this, and that was
to bring the War they had upon their Hands,
if possible, to a Conclusion, that so the An∣nual
Demand of Vast Sums for the carrying
It on, being at an End, the <HI>Hazards</HI> afore∣said,
and Difficulties for the raising it, would
Dye of course.</P>
<P>The Dangers of an Attempt of this Na∣ture
did not appear so great, as by People
out of the <HI>present Management</HI> was ima∣gin'd;
the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of the French King
were very well known; and he had disco∣ver'd
both the Necessity he was in of a
<HI>Peace,</HI> and his Desire of obtaining it, too
plainly for our Court not to know, that he
would accept the first Intimation of that
kind with a great deal of Willingness. The
<HI>Confederates,</HI> at the last Treaty, had ty'd him
down so Hard, had press'd him so Close up∣on
the Head of <HI>the Evacuation of</HI> Spain,
that he foresaw the Ruin of all his Glory,
if he had comply'd with them, and there∣fore
chose to hazard all in the Event of an∣other
Campaign, rather than to yield to
such. <HI>Dishonourable Terms</HI> as he thought
them: And tho' in the process of the next
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
<HI>Campaign,</HI> he met with unexpected Encou∣ragement,
as well from the Defeat of King
<HI>Charles's</HI> Armies in <HI>Spain,</HI> by which that
Prince was driven back again from the <HI>Es∣curial</HI>
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to his ancient Winter-Quarters
in <HI>Barcelona,</HI> as from the sudden
and unexpected Death of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> which
was necessarily attended with drawing off
a considerable Part of the Forces in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
by all which Accidents concurring in his
Favour, the <HI>Campaign</HI> ended without any
considerable Disadvantage on his Side; yet
he had not fall'd to make use. of his utmost
dexterity to bring the <HI>Confederates</HI> to a <HI>Ge∣neral
Treaty of Peace:</HI> He had, in vain, ap∣ply'd
himself to the <HI>States of Holland,</HI> to
the Duke of Savoy, to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI>
and others; and it was no difficult Matter,
upon the least Intimation of a probability
of Success, to bring him to make the like
Application to the <HI>British-Court:</HI> How this
was brought to pass, and by what Agents,
whether by Application from hence, or by
Application from thence, the Facts stand too
near in time for any Author with safety to
follow Truth so close at the Heels.</P>
<P>It may suffice to record, That about the
Month of <HI>September</HI> two Persons were ad∣mitted
to come hither from <HI>France,</HI> in order
to lay the Platform of the desired Treaty,
we may do the <HI>French</HI> that Justice, as to
own, That if the <HI>English</HI> Court were not to
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
be drawn in to Conclude and Sign Articles of
Peace for themselve, previous to the <HI>Gene∣ral
Treaty</HI> propos'd, and seperate from the
rest of their Allies; it 'twas not for want
of the utmost Endeavour, most tempting
Proposals, extraordinary Dexterity, and Ad∣dress
of the <HI>French</HI> Agents employ'd here
nor can we entirely clear the <HI>French</HI> from
a Suggestion, very much to the Disadvantage
of their Integrity, which was, of industriously
spreading Abroad, as well in <HI>Holland</HI> as in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
a Report, That the <HI>English</HI> had made a
<HI>seperate Peace;</HI> whether the <HI>French,</HI> if they
had any Hand in this, did it with a Design
to draw some of the other <HI>Confederates</HI> into
the like Snare, we cannot determine.</P>
<P>However, the French Agents were dis∣appointed
in their Expectation; the End
here was fully answer'd, and the <HI>English
Ministry</HI> brought the French to Sign and De∣liver
<HI>Praposals,</HI> and to Request Her Majesty
to procure a <HI>General Treaty</HI> with the Allies
at the same Time, Entering into no <HI>Engage∣ments</HI>
with <HI>France</HI> of any Kind, farther than
a <HI>Verbal Promise to communicate the said
Proposals to the Allies,</HI> and to influence
them, as far as might be, to consent to a
<HI>Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be amiss, however, to note what
Use was made of this Step; how near it
went to have cross'd the whole Scheme of
the Ministry; and to have defeated them in
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
the <HI>Great End</HI> they aim'd at, <HI>viz.</HI> of
<HI>Establishing themselves,</HI> which indeed, as be∣fore,
was the main Design of Embracing
the <HI>Proposals atall,</HI> as was apparent on
many Occasions.</P>
<P>But the other Party took Fire at the
<HI>Proposals,</HI> and, Allarming all our own Peo∣ple
first, they quickly spread the Jealousy
among the <HI>Allies;</HI> and it became, at once, a
received Opinion, That the Queen of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> was a going to make a <HI>Seperate
Peace</HI> with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot say but the <HI>Policy,</HI> appear'd on
this Side also, for Trick and <HI>Cunning</HI> run
too much thro' the Measures of both: The
first wrong Step taken here was this; <HI>The
French</HI> had delivr'd <HI>Proposals</HI> to the <HI>English</HI>
for a <HI>General Treaty,</HI> drawn up in several
Heads, containiag what they would do at a
<HI>Treaty</HI> to bring to pass the Repose of
<HI>Christendom.</HI> I should not need to have pub∣lish'd
the <HI>Proposalss</HI> here, as they relate to the
<HI>Peace,</HI> for that is not the Business of these
Sheets, but as they relate to the <HI>Manage∣ment</HI>
of <HI>Parties</HI> here; and as I shall be oblig'd
to say much of them afterwards, it is necessa∣ry
they should be handed down with the <HI>Sto∣ry,</HI>
that <HI>Postrity</HI> may see with <HI>Trifles assisted</HI>
to embarrass this distracted <HI>Age.</HI> The <HI>Proposals</HI>
are as follow:</P>
<Q><PB N="72" REF="81"/>
<P>Seven Articles propos'd on the Part
of <HI>France,</HI> for effecting a <HI>General
Peace;</HI> communicated to the Fo∣reign
Ministers residing here. Done
at <HI>London, September</HI> 27. 1711.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The most Christian King declares,
That be Will acknowledge the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> in that Quality, as also
the Succession of that Crown according
to the present Settlement.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That he will freely and <HI>BONA∣FIDE</HI>
consent to the taking of all just
and reasonable Measures for hindering
that the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
may never be united on the Head of the
same Prince; <HI>His Majesty being per∣suaded</HI>
that this Excess of Power would
be contrary to the Good and Quiet of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The King's Intention is, that all
the Parties engag'd in the present War,
without excepting any of them, may find
their reasonable Satisfaction in the
Treaty of Peace which shall be made:
That Commerce may be re-establish'd and
maintain'd for the future, to the Advan∣tage
of Great Britain, <HI>of</HI> Holland, and
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
of the other Nations, who have been ac∣custom'd
to exercise Commerce.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As the King will likewise main∣tain
exactly the Observation of the Peace,
when it shall be concluded, and the Ob∣ject
the King proposes to himself being
to secure the Frontiers of his Kingdom,
without disturbing in any manner what∣ever
the Neighbouring States; He pro∣mises
to agree, <HI>by the Treaty which
shall be made,</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> shall be
put into Possession of the Fortify'd Places
<HI>which shall be mentioned</HI> in the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI>
to serve hereafter for a Bar∣rier,
which may secure the Quiet of the
Republick of <HI>Holland</HI> against any Enter∣prize
from the part of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly;</HI> The King consents likewise, that
a secure and convenient Barrier should
be form'd for the Empire, and for the
House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Notwithstanding <HI>Dunkirk</HI> cost
the King very great Sums, as well to
acquire it, as to fortify it; and that `tis
further necessary to be at very conside∣rable
Expence for razing the works,
his Majesty is willing however, to engage
to cause them to be demolish'd immedi∣ately
after the Conclusion of the Peace;
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
on Condition, that, for the Fortifications
of that Place, a <HI>proper Eqivalent,</HI> THAT
MAY CONTENT HIM, be given him;
And as <HI>England</HI> cannot furnish that
Equivalent, the Discussion of it shall be
referred to the Conferences to be held for
the Negotiation of the Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> When the Conferences for the
Negotiations of the Peace shall be form'd,
all the Pretentions of the Princes and
States engaged in the present War, shall
be therein discuss'd bona fide and ami∣cably;
And nothing shall be omitted to
regulate and terminate them to the Sa∣tisfaction
of all the Parties.</P></Q>
<P>The first Question which was started in
the World, upon the appearance of these <HI>Pro∣posals</HI>
was, whether the <HI>French</HI> intended them
to be received as <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> in the Sense
that Word is now of late accepted in: I can∣not
pretend to say they did; but this is most
certain, that the Queen never understood
them so.</P>
<P>But since the rest of the <HI>World</HI> run away
with, them as such, whether artfully or ac∣cidentally,
I will not determine; and that
the Dispute about this Matter, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe∣ther
they were to be <HI>esteern'd Preliminaries</HI>
or no, made such a Noise, it may be necessa∣ry
to clear it up as we go; and <HI>First,</HI> It is
<PB N="75" REF="84"/>
to be enquir'd into, what is to be under∣stood,
or rather what was then understood
by the Word <HI>Preliminary,</HI> that is, What was
the <HI>General Acceptation</HI> of the Word:
And to give you this as concisely as pos∣sible,
and subject to as little Objection as
we can, it cannot be back'd with better
Authority than the particular <HI>Memorial</HI> of
the <HI>Elector of Hanover,</HI> and the other
<HI>Publick Papers,</HI> wherein it is thus ex∣press'd;
<Q>Preliminaries <HI>which are to be the Ground
of a Treaty; Settling all Things by</HI>
Preliminary, <HI>so as that there sbould be
nothing to da at the</HI> General Congress
<HI>but to give them the Form of a</HI> Treaty.</Q></P>
<P>This was the <HI>Sense</HI> in which the Words
were then understood: Such of the People
at Home as were against the <HI>Treaty</HI> were
most willing to call the <HI>French Proposals
Preliminaries</HI> in this Sense; and much
Time and Pains was therefore spent in Ex∣posing
them, as of double <HI>Entendre,</HI> of
doubtful <HI>Construction,</HI> capable of being <HI>so</HI>
and <HI>so</HI> misunderstood on either Side, and
leaving room to the <HI>French</HI> Dexterity of
Evading the True and Genuine Design of
the <HI>Confederates.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd but this was most
true, if the <HI>Proposals</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> had been
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
so receiv'd, for they contained nothing but
what was capable of such <HI>General Constru∣ction</HI>
as any one pleased to turn them to:
And this very Argument prov'd to others,
that they could not be thought to be <HI>Pre∣liminaries</HI>
in the Sense as above; nay, the
more imperfect and ambiguous they ap∣pear'd
to be, as to such a <HI>Construction,</HI> the
more unlikely and improbable it was that
the <HI>French</HI> could expect, or the <HI>British
Court</HI> could imagine, that the <HI>Consederates</HI>
should receive them as <HI>Preliminaries</HI> of a
Treaty.</P>
<P>As soon, therefore, as these Objectons
came Abroad, they seem'd to require no
other Reply than to Publish them as <HI>Pro∣posals</HI>
as they. really were receiv'd, and to
disown them as <HI>Preliminaries.</HI></P>
<P>But the first Error had gone so far, and
the <HI>Confederates</HI> had receiv'd such Impres∣sions
from hence, that the <HI>British Court</HI> had
shown them <HI>foul Play,</HI> and had accepted the
said <HI>Articles as Preliminaries</HI> in the Senso
above; that large <HI>Representations</HI> were made
of it from Abroad, as well by the States of
<HI>Holland</HI> as by the <HI>Elector of Hanover,</HI> but
more especially the Ernperour, then King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> who appear'd highly mov'd, as it
was said, and testify'd his Resentment, at his
Landing at <HI>Genoa,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> the
<HI>English</HI> Envoy, who came to Compliment
him there, in Expressions less respectful to Her
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
<HI>Britannick Majesty</HI> than might be expected
from a Prince under so many Obligations
as the Queen had laid on him. It seems
King <HI>Charles</HI> might then think otherwise
of himself than on former Occasions, when
his Dependance on the Assistance which he
Daily receiv'd from Her said Majesty oblig'd
him to treat Her with the utmost Deference
and Respect. But how, says the Author
of this Story, he tells Her, That <HI>If Her
Majesty thought fit to go on in this Manner,
it would oblige him to take other Measures
for his own Security; and that the Rest of
the Confederates must and would do the like
by his Example;</HI> Or to that Effect. After
this, when he came to receive the <HI>Propo∣sals,</HI>
as above, and with the rest of the <HI>Fo∣reign
Ministers</HI> to mistake them for <HI>Preli∣minaries</HI>
as aforesaid, we find him declaring
against entering into any Treaty with France
on that Foundation; and this in Terms so
absolute, that he calls his Resolutions <HI>Unal∣terable,</HI>
resolving to push forward the <HI>War</HI>
with all imaginable Vigour: It is more at
large to be seen in his Majesty's Letter to
the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to the Elector <HI>Pa∣latine,</HI>
as follows:</P>
<P>THAT his Majesty did not question but
that his Electoral Highness had been in∣formed
of the <HI>Preliminaries</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> propos'd
in <HI>England</HI> on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> (a Copy
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
of which he subjoin'd) and wax no less con∣cern'd
than his Majesty, that a Time when
God had so largely bestow'd his Blessings on
the Arms of the Allies, and when there was
ground to hope to reduce the Enemy within
just Bounds, for the securing the Tranquillity
of <HI>Europe,</HI> that Crown should offer such Pro∣posals,
which had not been only hearken'd to
at <HI>London,</HI> but also had been communicated
in Form, the 9th <HI>October,</HI> to Count <HI>Gallas,</HI>
Minister of his Majesty, by a Secretary of
State, and propos'd in <HI>Holland</HI> as acceptable,
with earnest Instances for entring into an
Negotiation thereupon; That hitherto his
Majesty had been unwilling to look upon this
Precipitation as a Departing from the Aim
and <HI>Intention</HI> of the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> see∣ing
the Obligation the <HI>Allies</HI> are under, not
to enter into any Negotiation of a <HI>Separate
Peace,</HI> is sufficiently known by all the World,
according to the <HI>Treaty of Alliance,</HI> and
therefore was rather inclin'd to believe, that
they had too easily given Credit to the Cap∣tious
<HI>Proposals</HI> of the Enemy, tho' they were
not so well varnish;d as others had been; for
every one perceiv'd, at first Sight, that hard∣ly
any one thing in them was clearly express'd,
and that the Enemy's Design was to gain Time,
by a long Nagotiation, as well for Recovering
themselves, as for Dividing the Allies, which
they have endeavour'd to do along Time since;
that it was not difficult to foresee the Conse∣quences,
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
if Men would only consider, with at∣tention,
that since, with so great Effusion of
<HI>Blood,</HI> and such unconceivable <HI>Expences,</HI> the
United Forces of the Allies have not yet been
able to obtain the Principal End of this War,
that is, the common <HI>Security</HI> and <HI>Tranquil∣lity</HI>
of <HI>Europe,</HI> what more can be expected
from a <HI>Separate Treaty,</HI> or its Execution,
than what has happen'd in respect to the so∣lemn
Oaths of the Renunciation at the <HI>Pyre∣nees,</HI>
and other Engagements, which were to
be Perpetual, and especially when the <HI>French</HI>
shall be Masters of the Forces of <HI>Spain, In∣dies,</HI>
and all the Commerce.</P>
<P>As for us (<HI>continues the Emperor</HI>) we
hope the Contrary and are entirely perswa∣ded,
that you will be of the same Opinion
insomuch, that you will not only Oppose these
Designs, that are pernicious to the common
Cause, according to your renowned Zeal for
your Country; but also, that you will powerful∣ly
use your great Credit with the Electors and
States of the Empire, and also with the <HI>States</HI>
General of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> and
other Allies, as we affectionately desire of you
by the near Tie of Blood that is between us,
that they may all persevere together in the
Engagements of the Alliance, and in the ne∣cessary
Union, for Obtaining an Advantage∣ous
and Solid Peace, and that in <HI>England</HI>
they may, following this laudable Example,
desist from such Thoughts as are contrary,
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
and entertain such as are conformable there∣unto.</P>
<P>In the mean Time we have undertaken an
irrevocable Resolution to undergo, whatever
may come of it, and to exert all our Efforts
for the Good of the <HI>Common Cause,</HI> expo∣sing
even our own Person rather than con∣sent
to the Sending of any one in our Name,
to assist in a partial Negotiation, entirely rui∣nous
for our Dear <HI>Country,</HI> and the Liberty
of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and which we could not an∣swer
to our <HI>Archducal House.</HI></P>
<P>We have thought fit to represent you these
Things without Delay, as to an <HI>Elector</HI> and
an <HI>Ally,</HI> so particularly Interested in this
War, to the End you may assist us with your
<HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Endeavours</HI> for the Strengthen∣ing
of the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> for which We
and our <HI>Archducal House</HI> will preserve an
Eternal Gratitude, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might give you several other Proofs of
this general Mistake, as well from Authors
who, both Abroad and at Home, wrote up∣on
the Subject, and exclaim'd loudly against
these <HI>Articles,</HI> as <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> as also seve∣ral
other Letters of his said Catholick Ma∣jesty
to other Persons, as to the <HI>States of
Holland,</HI> to the other <HI>Electors, &amp;c.</HI> but this
may suffice</P>
<P>All these prove, undeniably, the general
Acceptation of those Proposals at that time,
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
as aforesaid; whether It was at first Acci∣dentally
or Politickly done by our People
here, as I said before, I do not determine.</P>
<P>The next Case, therefore, was for the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI>
here to explain themselves, how
these Proposals were understood by them
and how they expected their Allies should
understand them; and this was done so ef∣fectually,
that at last the <HI>Emperor</HI> seeing, at
the same time, the <HI>Treaty</HI> would be actual∣ly
carry'd on without him, thought fit to
comply.</P>
<P>But when this Difficulty seem'd, In a Man∣ner
clear'd up, another no less Dangerous,
tho', perhaps as Artificially contriv'd, and
as Successful, in its Mischief appear'd, <HI>viz.
That the Peace was already made.</HI></P>
<P>This was a new Scarecrow: If I do not
give an Account of the Effect it had, both
Abroad and at Home, it is rather to conceal
Folly of it, than that the Thing was not of
very ill-Consequence: It was impprov'd at
<HI>Home</HI> to promote the <HI>Dissatisfactions,</HI> which
were already great enough, at the Procee∣dings
towards a <HI>Treaty:</HI> the <HI>Condition</HI> of the
Nation was at this time very <HI>Unhappy;</HI> and
the Forwardness of the People to <HI>Insult</HI> and
<HI>Quarrel</HI> at every Thing, made eyen those
Things they had least reason to object against,
appear worse than they were: The general
<HI>Management</HI> carry'd with it an appearance of
something <HI>Secret;</HI> and the People Univer∣sally
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
Jealous of the <HI>Court,</HI> thought there
was a <HI>Private Aim</HI> which none could pene∣trate
In every Thing they did, and therefore
frequent Conjectures were made as Men's
<HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Prejudices</HI> guided them.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy Circumstance to be ren∣der'd
generally suspected, for that whatever is
done under that <HI>Dilemna,</HI> that will admit two
Constructions, always receives the worst.
It Is true, the <HI>Court</HI> aim'd at a <HI>Peace,</HI> and their
Reasons for it were so pressing, that it was
apparent they would abate much of the
Terms to bring it to pass; their Circum∣stances
at Home made it Necessary, as is no∣ted
before; yet, that from hence it was Ra∣tional
to suppose they would give up all;
that they were in the Interest of <HI>France;</HI>
that they design'd to bring in the <HI>Pretender;</HI>
that they were resolv'd to rescind the Suc∣cession;
these were all Extreams the other
Way, and artfully made use of by those
who were agianst a Peace, for the same Rea∣sons
for which the <HI>Ministry</HI> were for it; so
that, in short, the Scheme of the <HI>Strife</HI> lay
In this short Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministry</HI> were for a <HI>Peace,</HI> because
they should then be freed from the Weight
that embarrass'd them every Year, <HI>viz.</HI> Of
Finding <HI>Funds;</HI> Keeping up <HI>Credit;</HI> and
Borrowing great Sums of <HI>Money;</HI> And to
this End also be subjected to the <HI>Triennial
Danger</HI> of having an Election of <HI>Parliament</HI> go
<PB N="83" REF="92"/>
against them, whereby they might be check'd
in the <HI>Management</HI> of <HI>Publick Affairs;</HI>
whereas, if the <HI>War</HI> was once over, there
would be little Need of Supplies, and by
Consequence, less Need of <HI>Parliaments;</HI> short
Sessions, and little Business, would, in Time,
make Calling <HI>Parliaments</HI> less frequent, and
the <HI>Court</HI> would be under no Difficulties
for the <HI>Managing</HI> the <HI>Government;</HI> the
Annual Support of the <HI>Crown</HI> was settled,
and the Forces to be left Standing were
but small so that, in short, the <HI>Ministry</HI> ha∣ving
once ended the War, were establish'd;
effectually past any <HI>Difficulties;</HI> any <HI>In∣treagues;</HI>
or any <HI>Accidents</HI> Intervening to
hurt them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Party</HI> who were displac'd, convin∣ced
of all this, and too Wise not to see the
Design, left no Stone unturn'd, as above,
to make all the Notion of a <HI>Treaty</HI> appear dis∣bonourable;
to do this they suggest that there
was a Concert with <HI>France;</HI> that the Ministry
had made a private <HI>Bargain;</HI> that <HI>Spain,</HI> for
which so much Blood had been lost, was to be
given up to the <HI>French;</HI> and, at last, in short,
that the <HI>Treaty</HI> was but a Sham; a meer <HI>Ignis
Fatuus;</HI> a <HI>Grimace</HI> between the <HI>English</HI> and
the <HI>French,</HI> and that the <HI>Peace</HI> was made
already.</P>
<P>It was very hard to beat the first Suspi∣cions
of this out of the Heads of the Peo∣ple;
it was argu'd against strenuously, by
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
one Author, upon an Argument taken from
a <HI>Fast-Day,</HI> which the Queen had just then
appointed to be kept: Wherein the Words
run thus;</P>
<P>That a <HI>Publick Fast</HI> be Observ'd, that so
both we and our People may humble our selves
before <HI>Almighty God,</HI> in Order to obtain
Pardon for our Sins; and may, in most de∣vout
and solemn Manner, send up our Pray∣ers
and Supplications to his <HI>Divine Majesty</HI>
to avert those heavy judgments which our
many Sins and Provocations have most justly
deserv'd and for Imploring his Blessing on
that intended <HI>Treaty,</HI> that thereby may be
produced an <HI>Honourable, Secure,</HI> and <HI>Lasting
Peace</HI> to <HI>Us,</HI> and the <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>States</HI> in Al∣liance
with us; and that he will be pleas'd to
give his Blessing and <HI>Assistance</HI> on the <HI>Arms</HI> of
<HI>Us</HI> and our <HI>Allies,</HI> our and their <HI>Forces,</HI> both
by Sea and Land, 'till our <HI>Enemies</HI> shall sub∣mit
to such a <HI>Peace. Vid.</HI> Proclamation.</P>
<P>This It was argu'd must either prove, That
there was no such Thing as a <HI>Seperate
Peace</HI> already concluded, or they must all
agree to think the Queen a <HI>Pagan,</HI> a Mocker
of God, and a Despiser of all <HI>Religion:</HI>
That Her Majesty should <HI>Order the whole
Nation to pray to God for a</HI> Blessing <HI>upon the</HI>
Negotiation <HI>of the</HI> Treaty, <HI>that a Safe,</HI> Ho∣nourable,
<HI>and</HI> Lasting Peace <HI>may be the
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
Issue;</HI> (these are the very Words) <HI>If that
Peace were settled already, that God would
bless and assist the Forces of Her Majesty and
Her</HI> Allies, <HI>in Order to push the</HI> Enemy, <HI>'till
he will submit to such a Peace,</HI> (the very
Words again;) If the <HI>Peace</HI> was made, and
no Forces to be more employ'd, this would
be such a horrid Thing, that it could not
enter into the Thoughts of any reasonable
Person to suspect such a Thing of the
Queen.</P>
<P>However, these Arguments had some Ef∣fect,
yet they were far from satisfying the
People, or removing the Jealousy of those
who were possess'd before with the Notion
of it by the People, and for the Reasons
abovesaid, 'till the Queen, alarm'd with the
Reproach of it, and the <HI>Ministry</HI> seeing plain∣ly
the evil Consequences which might en∣sue,
took Notice of it in a Message to the
<HI>Parliament,</HI> then Sitting, <HI>January</HI> the 17th,
1711; as follow's,</P>
<P>AT the Opening of this Session, Her Ma∣jesty
acqttainted Her Parliament, That
both Time and Place were appointed for the
Meeting of the <HI>Plenipotentiaries</HI> of all the
<HI>Confederates,</HI> to Treat with those of the
<HI>Enemy</HI> concerning a <HI>General Peace;</HI> and al∣so
express'd the Care which <HI>She</HI> intended to
take of all Her <HI>Allies,</HI> and the strict <HI>Union</HI>
in which She propos'd to join with them, in
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
Order to obtain a Good <HI>Peace,</HI> and to Gua∣ranty
and Support it when obtain'd.</P>
<P>Her Majesty can now tell you, That Her
<HI>Plenipotentiaries</HI> are arrived at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and
have begun, in Pursuance of their Instructions,
to concert the most proper Ways of Procuring
a just Satisfaction to all in <HI>Alliance</HI> with
Her; according to their sveral <HI>Treaties,</HI>
and particularly with relation to <HI>Spain</HI> and
the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>You may depend on Her Majesty's Com∣municating
to Her Parliament the Terms of
<HI>Peace,</HI> before the same shall be concluded.</P>
<P>The World will now see how groundless
those Reports are, which have been spread
Abroad, by Men of Evil <HI>Intentions,</HI> to serve
the Worst Designs as if a <HI>Separate Peace</HI>
had been Treated, for which there has not
been the least Colour given.</P>
<P>Her Majesty's Ministers have Directions
to propqse, That a Day may be fix'd for the
Finishing, as was done for the Commence∣ment
of this <HI>Treaty,</HI> and in the mean Time,
all the Preparations are hastening for an early
Campagne. Vid Queen's Message, <HI>Jan,</HI> 17, 1711.</P>
<P>This did the Work effectually, the
Thing was now dropt at once, and the Peo∣ple
began to be easy as to this Point, and
yet I will not Compliment them so much
as to say they were made so by the meer
Confidence in Her Majesty's <HI>Affection,</HI> the
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
Times were too diffident, and the usual Dia∣lect
of the <HI>Parties</HI> course enough to give a
Man Occasion to hear even, both Sides cry
out, <HI>They would not believe it any Thing
the more for what bad been said;</HI> but Two
Things stop'd the Mouth of this Piece of
<HI>Clamour.</HI></P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Nearness of the <HI>Treaty</HI> when the
Thing must inevitably come to a De∣monstration;
and when all the <HI>Pleni∣potentiaries
being to meet,</HI> if there
were any Concessions made to <HI>France,</HI>
by the <HI>British Court,</HI> the other <HI>Parties</HI>
who might think themselves agriev'd
by them, would not fail, loudly to com∣plain
of it, and so it would have a Con∣firmation
too plain to be contradicted.
The next was,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Promise the Queen made, in Her
Message above, to lay the Heads of the
<HI>Treaty</HI> before the <HI>Parliament</HI> for them
to peruse, and, indeed, judge or approve
of before the same should be conclu∣ded;
and to fix a short Day for the
<HI>French</HI> to comply with what should be
propos'd, or the <HI>Treaty</HI> to be put to a
Conclusion.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>These Two Things so either satisfy'd
those who were dubious and in different, or
stop'd the Mouths of those who were cla∣morous
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
and quarrelsome, that we heard no
more of the Notion of a <HI>Seperate Peace</HI> be∣ing
made in <HI>England:</HI> Yet, that this Thing
may be left a little plainer to Posterity than
the People, at this Time, could be inform'd
of it, I may venture to say thus much of
what was done by Way of secret Transacti∣on,
and which, I must own, I do not see
that any room was left for any one at
Home to complain of it neither.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> having try'd, in vain, to bring
the <HI>Confeder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> to a <HI>General Treaty,</HI> and to
lay aside the <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> which were as
so many Fetters upon them, that had ham∣per'd
and lock'd them up to such Severities,
as they judg'd equal to the Ruin of their
<HI>Monarch,</HI> had chosen Twice to venture All
rather than to comply with that Method of
<HI>Treating.</HI></P>
<P>But their Necessity of a <HI>Peace</HI> encreasing,
and the Misfortunes of the <HI>War</HI> pressing
them hard, they behov'd to try it, by ma∣king
larger Concessions to <HI>One Branch</HI> of
the <HI>Confederacy,</HI> than they had made in Ge∣neral,
to see it, thereby, they could induce
that Branch to espouse Thoughts of a <HI>Peace,</HI>
and concern themselves to bring it to pass.
The late <HI>Convu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the Breach
among <HI>Parties; Revolution</HI> in <HI>Ministry;
Dissatisfactions</HI> among the <HI>People;</HI> and in
general, the great Turn given to the <HI>Affairs</HI>
of our <HI>Government,</HI> gave them but too much
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
Reason to hope they might fix. their Project
here; the Occasion the <HI>Ministry</HI> here found,
<HI>as before,</HI> to disengage themselves from the
Embarrassinents of the War, in Order to
the Establishing themselves, and Defeating
the Outed-Party, as has been at large set
down, administer'd room enough for the
<HI>French</HI> to make the Attempt, and they were
too wise to slip the Occasion.</P>
<P>Accordingly, as has already been laid
down, <HI>Proposals</HI> are made by <HI>France,</HI> and
receiv'd by Her Majesty; and the Queen
so far comes into the <HI>French</HI> Desire to agree
to offer those Proposals to the <HI>Allies,</HI> and do
all the good Offices She could, or use Her
Interest with the <HI>Allies</HI> to bring them to a
<HI>Treaty,</HI> where, if his most Christian Majesty
would come Resolv'd, by his <HI>Plenipoten∣tiaries,</HI>
to make such <HI>Concessions</HI> and <HI>Propo∣sitions,</HI>
as might be satisfactory to the <HI>Allies,</HI>
it was not to be doubted but a good <HI>Peace</HI>
might ensue.</P>
<P>To say, That, in Order to bring the
Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to this, it was not
Just and Reasonable not only to assure Her
Majesty, That Her Subjects should find their
Interest in it, was as much as to say, That
all the <HI>Allies</HI> should receive Satisfaction but
Her Majesty: Nor could <HI>France</HI> expect that
the <HI>British Ministry</HI> would appear for this
<HI>Treaty,</HI> unless <HI>France</HI> had descended to such;
<HI>Proposals</HI> for such Advantages to <HI>Britain,</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
without Prejudice to the rest of the <HI>Allies,</HI>
as the Queen might have Reason to be sa∣tisfy'd
with; whereupon there is no doubt
but <HI>France</HI> enter'd into same Detail of par∣ticular
Satisfactions and Advantages for
<HI>Britain,</HI> which, at a general <HI>Treaty;</HI> the would
yield to Her <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> and that
She might engage to this, at the same Time.
The Queen, or the <HI>British Ministry,</HI> Engaging
to nothing more than this, That they would
endeavour to procure a general <HI>Treaty;</HI> and
that if, at the <HI>General Treaty,</HI> all the rest of
the <HI>Allies</HI> might receive full Satisfaction in
their just Demands, that then, indeed, Her
Majesty would not stick Out. And thus
the Whole of a <HI>Private Treaty</HI> amounted to
this, That <HI>France</HI> was under Engagements
to the Queen, but that the Queen was un∣der
none to him.</P>
<P>Nor did it appear that these <HI>Engagements</HI>
could ever amount to more, than what re∣spected
Possessions of <HI>Ports; Advantages</HI> of
<HI>Commerce;</HI> and <HI>Disposition</HI> of <HI>Countries</HI> in
the <HI>Spanish West Indies,</HI> for the Encrease of
the <HI>Wealth, Strengt, Naval Power,</HI> and
<HI>Trade of Britain;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I am now giving the clearest Scheme I
can of Things as they stood before the <HI>Trea∣ty</HI>
begun, and I find it needful to that Pur∣pose
to do so, because that, tho' these Things
may no more seem a Mistery after the
<HI>Treaty,</HI> when every Thing appears in its
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
proper Place, and with a true Light, yet it
is impossible to account for the various Dis∣orders
and Perplexities which agitated the
Minds of the People at this Time, but by laying
open the secret History of the Two
or Three Months preceding the <HI>Treaty,</HI>
from which so many various Incidents had
their View, tho', in their Effects, they had
no relation either to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> or to the
<HI>Peace</HI> it self, which was to follow.</P>
<P>I return, therefore, to the <HI>Parties:</HI> I left
off at Telling you how the Message of the
Queen to the Two Houses, the Nearness of
the <HI>Treaty</HI> it self, and the Necessity of a few
Days Discovering the Truth of Things,
hush'd and damp'd the Forwardness of those
People, who had affirm'd the <HI>Peace</HI> to be
already made. It's necessary, now, that I
go back a little to the Affairs of the Parlia∣ment,
that is to say, so far as they are link'd
with the present Case before us, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Strife of the <HI>Parties.</HI></P>
<P>The first Appointment for the Meeting
of the Parliament was on the 13th of Nov.
1711, as by the Proclamation, but, by
Two or Three Adjournments, they were
put off. The <HI>Peace</HI> bing the Great Thing
in Agitation at that Time, and the <HI>Ministry,</HI>
for the Reasons aforesaid, having good
Grounds to push on the Forming a <HI>Treaty,</HI>
no Body will doubt but they had the same
Reasons for the Preventing any warm Reso∣lusions
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
which might pass in either House to the
Prejudice of the said <HI>Treaty</HI> in View, and this,
perhaps, might make them keep the Meeting
of the Houses in some Suspence 'till they had,
by due Enquiry, Information, and Calcula∣tion,
a Thing commonly in Use, and known
by the Phrase of Telling Noses, and Trying
the Strength of the Houses; made a due
Judgment of what they might expect when
the Houses met. It is true, the Town dis∣cover'd
some Uneasiness, and People said,
They were afraid to let the Parliament <HI>Sit,
&amp;c.</HI> but the Ministry, not Regarding the
Clamours of a Few, went on their own
Way 'till they thought themselves Safe, and
then the Houses were allow'd to Meet.</P>
<P>At their first Meeting Her Majesty laid
before them the State of Things relating to
the Treaty of <HI>Peace</HI> in View. I need make
no Comment upon the Manner when the
Words are so plain, and therefore give it
you in the Queen's own Words thus;</P>
<P>I Am glad that I can now tell you, that not∣withstanding
the Arts of those who de∣light
in War, both Place and Time are ap∣pointed
for Opening the Treaty of a <HI>General
Peace.</HI></P>
<P>Our Allies (especially the <HI>States General</HI>)
whose Interest I look, upon as inseparable from
my own, have by their ready Concurrence,
express'd their entire Confidence in Me, and
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
I have no Reason to doubt but that my own
Subjects are assur'd of my particular Care of
them.</P>
<P>My Chief Concern is, That the <HI>Protestant
Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> of
these Nations, may be continu'd to you, by
Securing the Succession to the Crown as it is li∣mited
by <HI>Parliament</HI> to the House <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>I shall endeavour that after it War which
has cost so much Blood and Treasure, you may
find your <HI>Interest</HI> in <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI>
improv'd and enlarg'd by a <HI>Peace,</HI> with all
other Advantages which a <HI>Tender</HI> and <HI>Af∣fectionate
Sovereign</HI> can procure for <HI>a Duti∣ful</HI>
and <HI>Loyal People.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> which have been
engag'd with us in this <HI>War,</HI> being by <HI>Trea∣ties</HI>
entitled to have their several <HI>Interests</HI>
secur'd at a <HI>Peace,</HI> I will not only do my ut∣most
to procure every one of them all rea∣sonable
<HI>Satisfaction,</HI> but I shall also Unite
with them in the <HI>strictest Engagements,</HI> for
Continuing the <HI>Alliance</HI> in Order to render
the <HI>General Peace Secure</HI> and <HI>Lasting.</HI></P>
<P>The best Way to have this <HI>Treaty</HI> effectual
will be to make early <HI>Provision</HI> for the <HI>Cam∣pagne,</HI>
therefore I must ask of you, <HI>Gentlemen
of the House of Commons,</HI> the Necessary
<HI>Supplies</HI> for the next Year's <HI>War,</HI> and I do
most earnestly recomtnend to you to make such
Dispatch therein, as may Convince our Ene∣mies,
that if We cannot obtain a good <HI>Peace,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
We are prepared to carry on the <HI>War</HI> with
Vigour.</P>
<P>Whatever you give will be still in your own
<HI>Power</HI> to apply, and I doubt not, but in a little
Time, after the Opening of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> We
shall be able to Judge of its Event.</P>
<P>As I have had your Cheerful Assistance for
the Carrying on this long and chargeable <HI>War,</HI>
so I assure My self that no true <HI>Protestant,</HI>
or good Subject will envy <HI>Britain</HI> or Me, the
<HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of Ending the same
by a <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Honourable Peace</HI> for Us and all
our Allies.</P>
<P><HI>Vid.</HI> Queen's Speech <HI>Decemb. 7th,</HI> 1711.</P>
<P>Upon the Houses Entering into the Affair
it was immediately seen which Way Things
would go: The Commons fell in chearfully
with the Thing; thank'd Her Majesty for
Communicating it to them; left it to Her
prudent Conduct; and, in short, evidently
shew'd, that the Court would meet with no
Opposition, in the Affair of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> on
that Side, as may be seen by the following
Words of their Address;</P>
<P>WE Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal
Subjects, the Commons of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
in Parliament assembled, beg Leave to return
our <HI>Sincere</HI> and <HI>Hearty Thanks</HI> for your
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
Majesty's most Gracious <HI>Speech</HI> from the
<HI>Throne;</HI> wherein your Majesty, by expressing
your great Care and Concern, in so particular
a Manner, for the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> which,
above all Things; is most dear to Us; for
those <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> which make Us
peculiarly Happy above other Nations; and
for the Succession of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI>
as limited by <HI>Parliament,</HI> upon which the fu∣ture
Security of our <HI>Religion, Laws,</HI> and
<HI>Liberties,</HI> depends; has given Us a fresh
Demonstration That your Majesty has nothing
so much at Heart, as the <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Hap∣piness</HI>
of your People.</P>
<P>Having an <HI>entire Confidence</HI> in your Ma∣jesty's
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> in your <HI>Ho∣nour</HI>
and <HI>Justice</HI> to your <HI>Allies,</HI> and in your
<HI>particular Care</HI> of Your own Subjects, We
cannot but express Our <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in what
Your Majesty has been pleased to declare, of
the <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Honourable Peace</HI> your Ma∣jesty
has in View.</P>
<P>This was the End for which Your Majesty
entred into the <HI>War;</HI> and nothing can add
more to the Glory of Your Reign, than, actor
the many unparallel'd Successes in the Course
of this <HI>War,</HI> to have Your Majesty conclude
it with the Blessing of such a <HI>Peace;</HI> which,
We cannot doubt, will be rendred <HI>Secure</HI> and
<HI>Lasting,</HI> by Your Majesty's pursuing the <HI>Wise
Resolution</HI> You have taken, of Entring into
the <HI>strictest Engagements</HI> for Continuing the
<HI>Alliance</HI> to that End.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="105"/>
And We presume to assure Your Majesty,
We will take all possible Care to preserve that
<HI>Unanimity</HI> Your Majesty has recommended to
Us, and use our utmost Endeavours to disap∣point,
as well the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Designs</HI> of Those,
who, for private Views, may delight in <HI>War,</HI>
as the Hopes the <HI>Enemies</HI> may have vainly
entertain'd, of receiving Advantage from any
Division among Us.</P>
<P>We entirely concur with Your Majesty,
That the best Way to bring this <HI>Treaty</HI> to
<HI>Good Effect,</HI> is to make an early <HI>Provision</HI>
for the next <HI>Campagne;</HI> for which Purpose,
notwithstanding the heavy Burdens, which,
during this long and expensive <HI>War,</HI> Your
Majesty's Subjects have undergone, We will,
with the greatest <HI>Alacrity,</HI> grant such effectu∣al
and speedy Supplies, as shall enable Your
Majesty to carry on the <HI>War</HI> with Vigour, and
convince Your Enemies, if the <HI>intended Ne∣gotiations</HI>
should prove Ineffectual, That no
<HI>Amusements,</HI> or <HI>Attempts</HI> whatsoever, can
alter Our <HI>Firm</HI> and <HI>Stedfast Resolution</HI> of
Supporting the Best of, <HI>Sovereigns</HI> in Carrying
on so Just a <HI>War,</HI> till a <HI>Safe, Lasting,</HI> and
<HI>Honourable Peace</HI> may be procur'd for Your
Majesty and all Your Allies. <HI>Vid.</HI> the Com∣mons
Address <HI>December</HI> 10, 1711.</P>
<P>The Lords Address was well and wisely
Worded; gave Her Majesty Thanks, as the
<HI>Commons</HI> had done before, for Her Commu∣nicating
to them the Steps taken towards
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
a <HI>Peace;</HI> and for Her Concern for all Her
<HI>Allies; and the like:</HI> But, at last, they close
the said Address with a Clause, which pass'd
to be added to the Address, about the Gi∣ving
the <HI>Spanisn</HI> Dominion to the House of
<HI>Austria;</HI> as appears in the following Copy
of their Address.</P>
<P>WE Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Loy∣al
Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal in <HI>Parliament</HI> Assembled, do, with
Hearts full of <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Loyalty</HI> to
Your Sacred Majesty, beg Leave to Return
Your Majesty our most Humble and Hearty
Thanks and Acknowledgments for Your Ma∣jesty's
most <HI>Tender</HI> and <HI>Affectionate Concern</HI>
for all Your People, express'd in Your Ma∣jesty's
most Gracious Speech from the <HI>Throne;</HI>
and for Imparting to us Your Majesty's De∣sires
of Ending this present <HI>War</HI> by a <HI>Peace</HI>
Advantagious to Your Subjects, and <HI>Just</HI> and
<HI>Honourable</HI> for Your Majesty and all Your
Allies; as also for Your Majesty's Expressing
so particular a Regard for the Interest of the
<HI>States General,</HI> as inseparable from Your
own; and that Your Majesty is Graciously
pleas'd to Assure us, it is Your Chief Con∣cern,
that the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and the
<HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of these Nations, may be
Continued to Your People, by Securing the
Succession to the Crown, as, it is limited by
Parliament to the House of <HI>Hanover;</HI> and
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
that Your Majesty is pleas'd to shew so Just
a Resolution to Procure a Satisfaction for all
the Allies, being by <HI>Treaties</HI> Entitled to have
their several Interests Secured at a <HI>Peace,</HI>
and to Unite them in the <HI>Strictest Engage∣ments,</HI>
in Order to render the <HI>Peace Secure</HI>
and <HI>Lasting.</HI></P>
<P>And we do beg Leave to Represent it to
Your Majesyy as the humble Opinion and Ad∣vice
of this House, That no <HI>Peace</HI> can be
<HI>Safe</HI> or <HI>Honourable</HI> to <HI>Great Britain</HI> or
<HI>Europe,</HI> if <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies</HI> are
to be Allotted to any Branch of the House of
<HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P>This, tho' not in its Appearance of so
much Consequence as to shock the Court
in their <HI>Management;</HI> yet, as it was carry'd
on by One Side, and arm'd against by the
Other, was the Introduction to many great
and uncommon Scenes of, <HI>Politicks,</HI> which
appear'd, and shew'd themselve upon the
Stage of, <HI>Parties</HI> immediately after; a short
Scetch of which it cannot be unnecessary
to our Purpose to lay down; since it will be
very hard to know, without it, from whence
came all the <HI>Mischiers</HI> and <HI>Miseries</HI>
that are
inevitably to follow.</P>
<P>As the Appearance of the Houses disco∣ver'd
the <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of the <HI>Parties</HI>
to us without Doors, so it discover'd it also
to the <HI>Parties</HI> themselves. The <HI>Late Mi∣nistry,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
or <HI>Quted-Party,</HI> found they had no∣thing
to expect from the <HI>Commons,</HI> where
it was apparent they had lost their <HI>Interest</HI>
by the popular Methods aforesaid; but in
the Upper-House they had Hopes of Form∣ing
an Interest which might be able to make
some Stand, and might give a Check to the
<HI>Fury</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> with which the <HI>New Mi∣nistry</HI>
went on; and therefore they apply'd
themselves wholly to cultivate and form
this <HI>Interest,</HI> in Order to stop the Current
of the <HI>Opposite Party,</HI> as Things should come
before the House.</P>
<P>To fortify this <HI>Interest</HI> that Unhappy
Step was taken, which <HI>Posterity</HI> will feel
the Effects of for many Ages to come, <HI>viz.</HI>
Of Abandoning the <HI>Dissenters</HI> to the Ex∣tremity
they so often struggled with; I
mean the <HI>Occasional Bill;</HI> it may be true,
that Posterity may never be able to come at
all the <HI>Arcana</HI> of this <HI>Management;</HI> yet I
can by no means lay a true Ground Plot of
the Ensuing State of Things, as it respects
the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> unless I give some Account
of both how it came to be brought now on
the <HI>Stage</HI> at this Time; and how' by the
particular Persons that now appear'd for it,
Things equally mysterious and unaccoun∣table;
the true Account of which, as they
are not yet thoroughly discover'd to the
World, so it is very likely they never may.</P>
<P>I need not go back here to acquaint the
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
Reader with what the Meaning of the
Word, or of the Thing, was, or with the
History of the sundry <HI>Attempts</HI> to bring in
a Law against the <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> of
<HI>Dissenters;</HI> nor can it be reasonable to sug∣gest,
that I am Writing to Persons so igno∣rant
in the <HI>Affairs</HI> of the Times, because, to
such, most of the other Parts of this Book
will be neither Instructing or Entertaining.</P>
<P>It may suffice to note here, That there
was always a <HI>Party,</HI> in either House, who
had been so forward on all Occasions to in∣troduce
the <HI>Occasional Bill</HI> against the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
that it was well known they only
wanted the Opportunity, which they would
be very forward to embrace: It was as well
known that the <HI>Juncto,</HI> or <HI>Whigg</HI> Lords, or
<HI>Late Ministry,</HI> call them by which Name you
please, had, upon all Occasions, stood by the
<HI>Dissenters;</HI> oppos'd that <HI>Bill;</HI> and defended
the <HI>Interests</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as
a Branch of the <HI>Constituted Liberties</HI> of the
Nation, and as, what they always alleaged,
could not be overthrown without a <HI>general
Invasion</HI> of the National Privileges of the
People; and Breaking in upon the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>no less</HI> certain, that 'till these Two
Contraries, which were no less so than the
hottest <HI>Tories,</HI> and most violent <HI>Whiggss</HI>
should meet, both in Principle and in <HI>Inte∣rest,</HI>
they could never meet in <HI>Practice,</HI> and,
consequently, that the <HI>Occasional Bill</HI> could
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
never pass, but over the Bellies of the <HI>Let∣ter;
But that,</HI> whenever such a <HI>Conjuncti∣on</HI>
of Opposites should happen, the <HI>Occasio∣nal
Bill</HI> would be the first Step they would
take in Concert, and that <HI>Union</HI> must end
In the Ruin of the <HI>Interest</HI> of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
At this <HI>Unhappy Juncture</HI> this fortuitous
Meeting fell out. While the <HI>Whigg</HI> Lords,
joyning together in their Opposing the
Measures taken by the <HI>Ministry</HI> for the Car∣rying
on a <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peacey</HI> yet found some
who, tho' on the contrary extream in the
Affair of Parties, were yet of the same Opini∣on
as to the War, and whom they thought
easy to be brought to joyn in Measures to
carry on that Opposition: They therefore
made no Scruple to make Advances to these,
and to lay their former Disputes aside, in
Order to carry on a present Quarrel at the
Publick. The Party that did this had been
supported in all their Interests by the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> and had found the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
the true dead Weight on their Side, up∣on
all Occasions, by Voting for them in
all Elections; by Turning the Scale in
the Cases of Magistrates; Members Banks;
Companies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Supporting Credit; and
Supplying infinite Sums of Money upon
their Funds on all Occasions; and, as may
be well said, even without Funds, ma∣ny
Hundred Thousand Pounds, whereof
they are not paid to this Day, and, perhaps,
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
never shall be paid, and therefore this was
the more Surprizing. But this may be more
proper in another Place; I shall allude a
little to it by Transcribing to you a little
short Paper which was handed about in
Manuscript at that Time, call'd, <HI>A Speech
of a Stone</HI> Chimney-Piece, which alludes to
this very Transacrion, some Part of which
was to this Purpose:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Speech spoken by the Stone Chim∣ney-Piece
in the House of Lords.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bill for—being read and com∣mitted,
and no Lord offering to speak
against it, on a sudden a great Noise was
heard towards the Fire, and from a Crack
in the Chimney-Piece these Words were au∣dibly
heard.</P>
<P>Wonder not, my Lords, when you sit mute;
like <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>Stone,</HI> that I speak. I
am now a <HI>Peer,</HI> and since you, with Hearts
harder than Rocks, can tamely abandon those
poor Creatures who have trusted to your <HI>Pro∣tection,</HI>
without Saying one Word for them,
my softer <HI>Stone,</HI> cannot any longer keep Silence.</P>
<P>I have often been Witness, my Lords, to
the <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Passion</HI> with which some of you
have defended their <HI>Causes.</HI> I heard, with
<HI>Pleasure,</HI> those <HI>Reverend Prelates,</HI> those <HI>No∣ble
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
Patriots</HI> plead for them, and now I see
them Sit more, unconcern'd than my self.</P>
<P><HI>For God's sake,</HI> my lords, what meant
your former <HI>Zeal?</HI> Or what means your pre∣sent
<HI>Indolence?</HI> Were you in the Wrong
when you Oppose'd what novo you Consent to?
Or are you now in the Wrong in Consenting
to what you before reckoned the greatest Act
of Violence and <HI>Oppression?</HI> Speak, my
Lords; a Reason of your Change is due from
you.</P>
<P>Here was a long Pause, and all Silent;
What Silent still! I conjure you by your Ho∣nours,
my Lords, to speak; here was another
Pause; and yet Silent, what Silent still! Oh!
Shameful Change! Will not the Sense of
Honour move you more than <HI>Statues?</HI>
Hearken then to me and I still reprove you.</P>
<P>I will not, my Lords, tell all that I have
heard you whisper while you loll'd on me, in
your late unnatural <HI>Caresses;</HI> I will not ex∣pose
you too far, but I have not been totally
Deaf, I heard what pass'd token you sold your
Friends and fold them for <HI>Nought,</HI> for a
<HI>Vote,</HI> for a single Worthless Vote, that will
desert you in the Matter you depend upon it
for, and so return upon you a just <HI>Retribution.</HI></P>
<P>Was this, my Lords, an Equivalent for
those that had always stood by you; that had
endur'd <HI>Mobbing; Plundering; Burning;</HI>
and all Manner of <HI>Abuses</HI> for your Sakes;
Is it possible that, after all this, they should
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
be thus surrender'd without one Word for
them? Who, my Lords, will depend on you
after this? Who will move a Finger or Lip
in your Quarrel? Depend upon it, you will
miss your Aim; you have ruin'd your own <HI>In∣terest,</HI>
and have lost the Honour of Your for∣mer
<HI>Integrity.</HI> With what Regret will you
reflect on this Day's Action, when you shall
find your selves the Jest of those that decoy'd
you, and the Scorn of those that you have
abandon'd? Think of this: Repent if you
can, tho' it is too late: You can never Re∣trieve
it.</P>
<P>But this is all a Digression, and with it I
shall conclude this <HI>Unhappy Period:</HI> For now
the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> being sacrific'd to the Projects
of a <HI>Party,</HI> were given up by their Friends,
and effectually crush'd by their Enemies;
and the <HI>Occasionl Bill,</HI> which had so often
in vain been attempted, and had so often
ruin'd the <HI>Party</HI> that attempted it, was now
promoted by the <HI>Whiggs</HI> themselves, and
pass'd without one Man Opening his Mouth
against it, to the Ruin, not of the <HI>Interest</HI>
of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> only, but to the Ruin of
the Interest of the <HI>Whiggs</HI> in general, which,
by this Means, was effectually divided and
overthrown.</P>
<P>And here, because I have had, and shall
have so much Occasion to speak of the said
<HI>Occasional Bill,</HI> and for that this Book may
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
come to be useful in many Places, where
the said Bill is not to be seen, I think I can
not rationally omit giving a Summary of the
Bill it self, which is not long, and which,
in all Probability, will be the Subject of so
much Contention, and so many Complaints
in the World; and with this I shall end the
Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This Chapter gives an Account of the
Attempt made immediately after Pas∣sing
the Occasional Bill to introduce
Toleration, and the Common-Prayer
in Scotland; with some Observations
on the Injustice and Unreasonable∣ness
of that Design, how far it is or
is not consistent with the Constitution
of Scotland; with the Priviledges
of the Kirk; and with the Articles
of the Union: Also some little En∣quiry
at what may probably be the
Consequence thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Blow being struck in <HI>England</HI>
and the <HI>Whigg</HI> Lords having
thrown away the <HI>Scabbard,</HI> all <HI>Ac∣commodation</HI>
between them and
the <HI>Ministry</HI> was avowedly laid
aside, and either Party prepared themselves to
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
pursue those Methods which they thought
most immediately Conducing to the Mor∣tification
of the other without the least Sup∣position,
that they might, hereafter, be in
better Terms one with another.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ministry</HI> these Things made ve∣ry
little Alterations in the Measures they
had taken, only drove them to the Necessity
of making Use of other Hands; <HI>that is to
say,</HI> That whereas they would gladly have
gone on with <HI>Moderate Measures,</HI> and, per∣haps,
with <HI>Moderate</HI> Men too, if they could
have been found, they were now oblig'd
to go more fully and effectually into the
<HI>High-Flying</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI> Measures, and to take in
Persons of those <HI>Principles,</HI> who, for their
Want of Temper, they had always resolv'd
at least to lay by, if not totally to drop out
of the <HI>Management.</HI></P>
<P>We are not to expect the <HI>Tories</HI> were not
Men wise enough to know when their Turn
was in, as well as other Men; that they did
not see that now was the Time when they
were particularly useful, and therefore, that
they ought to take Care of themselves; that
since the Ministry were not equally, as be∣fore,
in a Condition to deny them any
Thing, now was the Time to make their
Demands; that now, if ever, was the Time
when they might establish the <HI>High-Church,</HI>
and for ever trample down the Whiggs, their
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>
Opposers, and that if they let it slip they
were never to expert such another.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Notion, which was but too
true, they took Care to lay about them, as we
shall see, and having hurry'd off the <HI>Occasio∣nal
Bill,</HI> and carry'd their Point in running
down the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as you have seen in the
former Chapter, it behov'd them to streng∣then
their Alliance, by doing; something for
their Friends in <HI>Scotland;</HI> this will lead me
in course to say something, by way of Intro∣duction,
to the State of Things in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
at that Time, in which I shall be as brief as
possible.</P>
<P>The <HI>Union</HI> had been but a few Years settled,
and this was but the Second <HI>Parliament</HI>
from the Joyning the Two <HI>Kingdoms</HI> in that
Great Act of <HI>Encorporation,</HI> which was made
firm and indissolvible, at least as much so as
was in the Power of Man's Invention to
Contrive, or of Human-Laws to Confirm;
it was the Peculiar of this <HI>Union,</HI> and what
more especially pinch'd the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That it settled the <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Church, and the Succession of <HI>Hanover;</HI>
and as these were both incompatible with
the Interests of that <HI>Party,</HI> either as <HI>Episco∣pal</HI>
in <HI>Principles,</HI> or as <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Politicks,</HI>
they watch'd their Opportunities, on all
Occasions, to supplant the One that the
Other might fall of Course; and both these
were to be done by a Breach on the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="125"/>
To effect this, the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church
was to be attack'd first, whose Securities
were very Shocking to the <HI>Party.</HI> This
had been prepar'd for a long while by Re∣ports
and Caluminies spread continually
about, of the Hardships suffer'd by the <HI>Epis∣copal
Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> under the <HI>Presbyte∣rian
Tyranny,</HI> who deny'd, as they pretended,
not Toleration only, in General, bur Liberty
of private Assembling together for the Wor∣ship
of God to those of differing Perswasion
from themselves.</P>
<P>It is too long a Work to come into this
Tract to enter into the Particulars of the
real <HI>Conduct</HI> of the Two Parties in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
arid thereby to confute the Reproaches cast
upon the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to <HI>Perse∣cution,</HI>
which really had no Ground, nor
was any such Thing true in <HI>Scotland;</HI> yet
some Generals may be necessary here to do
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> Justice in so noto∣rious
a Case, to leave upon Record for our
Posterity to see how notoriously we broke
F—th with our <HI>United Brethren,</HI> and how
soon we made Infractions into that <HI>Treaty,</HI>
which, with so much <HI>Art, Difficulty,</HI> and
<HI>Expence,</HI> with, so many <HI>Promises Protesta∣tions,</HI>
and <HI>Pretences</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Good Will</HI>
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> we, the <HI>English,</HI> brought them
to comply with; for, every one knows,
they were backward enough to come into
the <HI>Union;</HI> and the Queen's Speeches, as
<PB N="115" REF="126"/>
well to the Parliament as on other Occasi∣ons,
at the Time of Passing, and during the
Time of the <HI>Treating</HI> of the <HI>Union,</HI> and the
Parliament's Addresses to the Queen on the
same Occasion, are sufficient Evidences how
considerable that Transaction was esteem'd
to be among us here; what Value our <HI>Go∣vernment</HI>
put upon it; and how Earnest we
were to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>In 1705 we find the Parliament, in their
humble Address to Her Majesty, “Giving
Her their humble and hearty Thanks for
Her tender Regard to the Good and Wel∣fare
of Both Her Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland;</HI> (Note, I <HI>observe this as the
first Time that ever an</HI> English Parliament
<HI>thank'd their Sovereigns for the Regard
they had to the Welfare or Advantage of</HI>
SCOTLAND) for Her Great Care in Pre∣serving
the Succession of the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland</HI> in the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and
for Preserving the Peace, and Promoting
the UNION of the Two Kingdoms.”
[Vid. <HI>Commons Address,</HI> Novem. 11, 1705.]</P>
<P>This was the Temper with which it was
Introduc'd, to which I might have gone back,
and added how the Parliament had, the
Year before, Repeal'd <HI>an Act made in the
last Session of the Former Parliament, en∣tituled,
An Act to prevent the Dangers ari∣sing
from the Act of Security in</HI> Scotland;
<PB N="116" REF="127"/>
an Act which was, Indeed, a Force upon
<HI>Scotland</HI> to declare and joyn with <HI>England</HI>
in the Settlement of the Succession to the
Crown in the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and, im∣ply'd
a <HI>Declaration of War</HI> against them if
they did not, for It had order'd Twenty Two
Men-of-War to be fitted cur if the <HI>Scots</HI> did
not declare themselves by the 22d of <HI>Decem.</HI>
1704, to interrupt their Commerce with
France. This Act was so offensive to the <HI>Scots,</HI>
and they look'd upon it as such an Encroach∣ment
upon their independency, that they De∣clar'd,
They could not Treat of an <HI>Union</HI> un∣less
that Act was first Repeal'd. The <HI>English
Parliament,</HI> on the other Hand, to shew their
sincere Intentions, and the Temper they were
in to Unite with <HI>Scotland,</HI> readily came in to
the <HI>Proposal,</HI> and Repeal'd the said Act.</P>
<P>Thus far the Temper of the People ap∣pear'd
forward to the <HI>Union:</HI> How earnest
Her Majesty was to bring it to Perfection
we shall best see by the following Eviden∣ces
taken from Her own Mouth.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> During the Carrying on the <HI>Treaty</HI>
here, we find the Queen frequently Coming
to see what Progress they made, always ex∣pressing
Her earnest Desire to have it brought
to pass, and what a Happiness She should
esteem it to have that finish'd in Her Reign
which had so often, in vain, been attempted
in the Reign of Her Predecessors; and, to
examine this a little, we shall find frequent
<PB N="117" REF="128"/>
Instances of it, particularly <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 21<HI>st</HI>
of <HI>May,</HI> 1706, Her Majesty came to the
Meeting of the Commissioners at the <HI>Cock-Pit</HI>
at Whitehall, and, being Seated in Her
Chair, spoke to the Lords Commissioners, as
follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords,</OPENER>
<P>“I Am so much concern'd for the <HI>Union</HI>
of the Two Kingdoms, that I could
not satisfy my self without Coming, be∣fore
I went out of Town, to see what
Progress you have made in the <HI>Treaty,</HI>
And to recommend, very earnestly, to you
the Bringing it to a happy Conclusion
with as much Dispatch as the Nature of
it will admit, not Doubting of the gene∣ral
Satisfaction which my Subjects of
Both Kingdoms will receive, in Finding
you overcome all Difficulties to attain so
great and publick a Good.”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>After this, tho', every Night, an Account
was laid before Her Majesty of what had
been done in their Daily Meetings, yet Her
Majesty came once or twice more to see
the General Proceedings, and, as it were, to
hasten them on. At last we came to the
Great Period of that Part of the <HI>Treaty</HI>
which was finished at <HI>London,</HI> viz. <HI>Tuesday</HI>
the 23d of <HI>July,</HI> 1706, when the whole
Body of the Commissioners went with the
<PB N="118" REF="129"/>
Indenture of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> Sign'd and Seal'd,
to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and the <HI>Lord Keeper</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> first making a Speech to Her Ma∣jesty,
and then the <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
making another Speech, both on the
Subject of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> the Lords Commissi∣oners
for Both Kingdoms presented to Her
Majesty one of the Sign'd and Seal'd Instru∣ments,
or Writings, containing the Articles of
<HI>Union</HI> on the Part of <HI>England;</HI> upon which
Occasion Her Majesty was graciously pleas'd
to make the following Speech:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords,</OPENER>
<P>I Give you many Thanks for the great Pains
you have taken in this <HI>Treaty,</HI> and am
very well pleas'd to find your Endeavours
and Applications have brought it to so good
a Conclusion; the Particulars of it seem so
reasonable, that I hope they will meet with
Approbation in the Parliaments of Both King∣doms;
I wish, therefore, that my Servants of
Scotland may lose no Time in Going down to
propose it to my Subjects of that Kingdom;
and I shall always look upon it as a particu∣lar
Happiness, if this <HI>Union</HI> (which will be
so great a Security and Advantage to Both
Kingdoms) can be accomplish'd in my Reign.

<P><PB N="119" REF="130"/>
From this Time to the Month of <HI>Janua∣ry,</HI>
1707, we have the <HI>Treaty</HI> Carrying on
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which it needs not that I
should say much 'till afterwards; but upon
the Ratifying the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and Bringing it
back to the Parliament, Her Majesty made
the following Speech:</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords and Gentlemen,</OPENER>
<P>“HAving acquainted you, at the Open∣ing
of this Session, that the Treaty
for a <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
which had been concluded here by
the Commissioners appointed for that Pur∣pose,
in Pursuance of the Powers given
by the Parliaments of Both Kingdoms,
was then under the Consideration of the
Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> I can now, with
great Satisfaction inform you, that the
said <HI>Treaty</HI> has been ratify'd by Act of
Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> with same Alte∣rations
and Additions.”</P>
<P>“I have directed the <HI>Treaty</HI> agreed to by
the Commissioners of Both Kingdoms,
and also the Act of <HI>Ratification</HI> from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
to be laid before you, and I hope
it will meet with your Concurrence and
Approbation.”</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</OPENER>
<P>It being agreed by this Treaty that
Scotland is to have an Equivalent for
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>
what that Kingdom is oblig'd to contri∣bute
towards Paying the Debts of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
I must recommend to you that, in
Case ye agree to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> you will
take Care to provide for the Payment of
the Equivalent to <HI>Scotland</HI> accordingly.”</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>My Lords and Gentlemen,</OPENER>
<P>“You have now an Opportunity before
you of putting the last Hand to a Happy
<HI>Union</HI> of the Two Kingdoms, which, I
hope, will be a lasting Blessing to the
whole Island; a great Addition to its
Wealth and Power; and a firm Security
to the Protestant Religion.”</P>
<P>“The Advantages which will accrue to
us all, from the <HI>Union,</HI> are so apparent, that
I will add no more, but that I shall look
upon it as a particular Happiness if this
great Work, which has so often been at∣tempted
without Success, can be brought
to Perfection in my Reign. [Vid. <HI>Queen's
Speech to the Parliament,</HI> January <HI>the
qth170 6/7.</HI>]”</P>
</LETTER>
<P>And when the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI>
contrary to the general Expectation of the
World, had brought this great Transaction
to a Final End, then we shall find Her Ma∣jesty
of the same Opinion, and pressing Her
<PB N="121" REF="132"/>
People to put an equal Value on it with
Herself, in the following Words.</P>
<P>IT is the greatest Satisfaction that I have
given my Assent to a Bill for the <HI>Uniting
England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into one Kingdom.</P>
<P>I consider this <HI>Union</HI> as a Matter of the
greatest Importance to the <HI>Wealth, Strength,</HI>
and <HI>Safety</HI> of the <HI>Whole Island,</HI> and, at the
same Time, as a Work of so much Difficulty and
Nicety in its own Nature that, 'till now, all
Attempts which have been made towards it, in
the Course of above 100 Years, have prov'd,
ineffectual, and therefore I make no Doubt but
it will be spoke of, hereafter, to the <HI>Honour</HI>
of those who have been <HI>Instrumental</HI> in Bring∣ing
it to so Happy a <HI>Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>I desire and expect from all my Subjects of
Both Nations, that, from henceforth, they act
with all possible <HI>Respect</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> to one
another, that so it may appear to all the
World they have Hearts dispos'd to become
One People.</P>
<P>This will be a great Pleasure to me, and
will make us all quickly sensible of the good
Effects of this <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>And I cannot but look upon it as a par∣ticular
Happiness that in my <HI>Reign</HI> so full a
Provision is made for the <HI>Peace</HI> and, <HI>Quiet</HI> of
my People, and for the <HI>Security</HI> of our <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
by so firm an Establishment of the <HI>Pro∣testant
Succession</HI> throughout <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>[Vid. <HI>Queen's Speech to the Parliament,</HI>
March 6, 1706/7.]</P>
<P>I cannot think it improper to hint these
Things, tho' it seems to load me too much
with Quotations, that from the Height these
Extasies of Zeal for the Union run at the
Making thereof, we may view, with the
more Wonder, the sudden Turn which the
succeeding Circumstances of Affairs suffer'd
In this Temper, and how it could be possi∣ble
that the same Nation, the same Parlia∣ment,
and in the Reign of the same Queen,
could point all their Proceedings which re∣lated
to <HI>Scotland</HI> so directly against (that
People, and that <HI>Union</HI> which they had
courted and caress'd in such a Manner so
little a while before.</P>
<P>I know it may be reply'd, and will occur
most naturally, in the Consequence of the
Story, that most of these Oppositions began
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from <HI>Scotland</HI> it self, that
even the Gentry and Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
well in Parliament as out, not agreed only
to these Things, but even made the first Pro∣posals
of them, and that therefore <HI>England</HI>
could by no Means be reproach'd with it.</P>
<P>But they who consider the Nature of the
UNION, and the Circumstances both of
Persons and Things, must know, That the
Union was a Transaction which the Go∣vernment
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
and Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
then establish'd and consider'd in their le∣gal
establish'd Circumstances, <HI>viz.</HI> In State
entirely Independent, and Free; and in
Church wholly <HI>Presbyterian.</HI></P>
<P>To say that the Nobility and Gentry of
<HI>Scotland</HI> are for an <HI>Episcopal Government</HI> in
the Church, tho' we were to suppose it to be
true, which, it is manifest, it is not, yet, were
nothing to the Purpose, because we Treated,
Agreed, and United with them as <HI>Presbyte∣rian,</HI>
and establish'd their Church in all its
Powers and Privileges, as of Doctrine, Wor∣ship,
Discipline, and Government unaltera∣ble
for Ever.</P>
<P>No <HI>Act</HI> then can be equally National with
the <HI>Union,</HI> and to say that <HI>Scots</HI> Men bring
these Innovations upon them is rather an
Aggravation than an Extenuation of the
Thing? for the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church is now
under the general Protection of the Par∣liament
and the Government; and it is a
Debt, and the Duty of the Administration
to defend the said <HI>Presbyterian Establishment</HI>
against the Invasions of their own <HI>Jacobite</HI>
and <HI>Episcopal Disturbers,</HI> If a Woman is
single she may be insulted and made afraid
by her own Relations; she is liable to
Arrests, Prosecutions, and all Kinds of Le∣gal
Process for Debts, Trespass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
when she is married she is under Covert,
and her Husband is her Protector and De∣fender
<PB N="124" REF="135"/>
against alll Manner of Insults, and
especially from those of her own Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> knew at the Time of the Trea∣ty
what sort of People were in her own
Bowels; her <HI>Parliament</HI> or <HI>Civil-Represen∣tative,</HI>
knew it; her <HI>Assembfy,</HI> or <HI>Church-Re∣presentative</HI>
knew it, and I cannot do Justice,
even to the Latter, but by saying, that most
of the Ministers of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church,
who were for the <HI>Union,</HI> were mov'd to be
so, as they took the <HI>English</HI> Government to
be a Just and Upright Constitution, by which,
after they had once Capitulated for <HI>Liberty,</HI>
they should be sure to enjoy it; and by
which they should be sure to be Protected
from the Violence and Encroachments of their
own Private Episcopal Enemies: And if they
are Deceiv'd in this, I must acknowledge
they are Deceiv'd in that only Thing in
which it could be said, they had just reason
to depend upon <HI>England,</HI> To say then,
that their own People introduce this, is to
speak the most to the Disadvantage of the
<HI>English</HI> Side that can be imagin'd; for did
they not know their own People would do
thus? And why did they Unite with us,
but to obtain a just Protection against those
<HI>Trators</HI> of their own, who they knew
would do thus? And why was it that they
made such Provision for the Security of their
Church, but because they knew they had a
Party among themselve who would, if pos∣sible,
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
make an Advantage out of their Con∣federacy
with the <HI>English</HI> Clergy to Suppress
and Invade them.</P>
<P>This respects an Error in Argument, but
let us next enquire into matter of Right
and Justice, and the Reasons to be given in
behalf of <HI>Scotland,</HI> why the Encroachment
made, should not have been encourag'd here;
the most plain and direct Answer that seems
to offer itself in this Case, is that of the
Articles, in short express'd thus, <HI>viz.</HI> You
ought not, because you Articled with them
in the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI> that you would not;
they ought not to be thus used, because they
Condition'd in the <HI>Union</HI> that they should
not, and if this be made clear, there seems
to lie no other Argument against the Case.</P>
<P>To bring this to a clear Understanding,
nothing can be a more direct Method than
to bring the Cafe in Debate, to the Act of
the <HI>Union,</HI> and state them over-againgst: the
other: The Attempt in the Parliament here
consists of three Particulars:
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Preventing the Disturbing the <HI>Episco∣pal</HI>
Meetings, Reading the <HI>English</HI> Li∣turgy,
or, in few Words, Tollerating
the Common - Prayer - Book in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Repealing a Law which was Establish'd
by the <HI>Union.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="126" REF="137"/>
3. Taking from the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
the Privilege of retraining Irregular
Marriages and Baptisms.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>These Particulars seem to require a little
Explanation, to bring them down to those
Parts of the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI> which more
particularly are understood by the <HI>Scots</HI> to
provide against these very Attempts.</P>
<P>1. The Setting up the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and preventing the Di∣sturbing
the <HI>Meetings</HI> in the Exercise of
that Worship: this is what they call an <HI>In∣novation</HI>
in the Publick Worship; nor is it
sufficient to say, that this is not brought into
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but that the Wor∣ship
of the Church remains the same, since
by the Fifth Act of the First Parliament of
<HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> which Act also is made a
Part of the <HI>Union;</HI> this Clause which fol∣lows,
and by several other Acts, likewise the
said <HI>Clause</HI> was made <HI>Perpetual</HI> and <HI>Unaltera∣ble.</HI>
The UNIFORMITY, Mark the Word,
of the Worship, Discipline, and Government
of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as then in Use,
was to remain unalterable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Clause</HI>
runs thus: And more especially Her Majesty,
with Advice and Consent aforesaid, ratifies,
proves, and for ever confirms the Fifth Act
of the First Parliament of King <HI>William and
Queen Mary, intituled,</HI> An Act ratifying the
Confession of <HI>Faith,</HI> and Settling <HI>Presbyterian
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
Church Government</HI> with the <HI>Haill, other
Acts of Parliament relating thereto, in Prose∣cution
of the Declaration of the Estates of
this Kingdom, containing the Claim of Right;
bearing Date the Eleventh of</HI> April, <HI>One
Thousand Six Hundred Eighty Nine.</HI></P>
<P>This then will admit no Dispute, That
no <HI>Toleration</HI> can be given to any <HI>Innova∣tion</HI>
in <HI>Worship,</HI> tho' in private separate As∣semblies,
without Breach of the UNIFOR∣MITY
<HI>of Worship,</HI> and for this we need go
no farther than the <HI>Prosecutions</HI> of the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for many Years, who
were pursued, by the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> upon
what they call'd the <HI>Act of Uniformity, viz.</HI>
The Statue of <HI>Carol.</HI> II. <HI>Cap.</HI>—entituled,
<HI>An Act to preserve the Uniformity of Worship
in the Church</HI> of England.</P>
<P>That the Setting up the <HI>Common-Prayer,
Book</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> was an <HI>Innovation</HI> in their
<HI>Worship,</HI> could admit of no Dispute, and that
such <HI>Innovation</HI> was expressly Articled a∣gainst
in the <HI>Clause</HI> above, is as evident; so
that it seems very plain then, that the said
<HI>Liturgy</HI> could not be <HI>Tolerated</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>
without a direct <HI>Breach</HI> of the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>It may be argu'd, also, in Favour of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> That this was the Sense of the
Legislature at the Time of the making
this Law, and was understood on both
Sides; and this requires a little Secret
History to make up the Defficiency of
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
the common Opinions at this time. It was
to be observ'd, and was very remarkable
at that time, when the <HI>Act for the Security
of the Church of</HI> Scotland was Transacting,
that two sorts of People Oppos'd it there.
It is necessary for the Readers full Under∣standing
this Matter, that he should know
that the said Act was first Divised by an Over∣ture
for the Parliament, and then Debated
in the Assembly, or Commission of the As∣sembly
of the Church there; upon which
Occasion it was oppbs'd in the Commission
by some Ministers, who perhaps, having less
Confidence in the <HI>English</HI> than others had,
thought nothing sufficiently Secure that was
not in express Words set down, concluding
that, in an <HI>Episcopal</HI> Church of <HI>England</HI>
Parliament, every thing that would bear a
double Construction, would always be Con∣structed
to the Disadvantage of the <HI>Presbyte∣rians</HI>
and these believing the Act not to be
sufficient Security for them, would have
had a Tolleration of the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy
expresly Articled against for that reason.
I wish we had not since too much reason to
say these Men were too much in the Right.</P>
<P>There were another sort who, especially
in the Parliament, when the Act came there,
were against the Passing it, as Voteing it <HI>not
to be a sufficient Security for the Church</HI>
who yet were themselves utter Enemies to
the Church; and this was a very odd Cir∣cumstance,
<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
and of which the Author of
The Collections of the Affairs of the Union
has this Remark upon: “This appeared to
be the plain Design in that, as I have al∣ready
noted, the Gentlemen that spake
loudest for the Insufficiency of the Act of
Security were not of those People who
really were most concerned for the Safety
of the Church of Scotland; the Objecti∣ons
also, were not calculated for Amend∣ments,
or Additions, but for Destroying
the Bill itfelf, as built on the Supposi∣tion
of a Union which, they said, was a
Foundation that would not bear such a
Superstructure.”</P>
<P>These People also were for having the
Common-Prayer expresly, and in Words at
Length, provided against in the Act of Se∣curity,
and this, not that they concern'd
themselve for the Church, but because
they took it for granted that this would not
go down in England, and that, therefore, it
would overthrow the UNION, which was
what they aim'd at; and this may serve far∣ther
to unriddle it, <HI>viz.</HI> That those very
Men, or many of them, who would have
had a <HI>Clause</HI> inserted in the Act of <HI>Union</HI>
against the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> Literally and
Expresly, and who exclaim'd against the
Act, as not a sufficient Security for the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are the same who now eagerly
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
push the <HI>English</HI> upon letting up the <HI>Com∣mon-Prayer-Book</HI>
in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>However, at last the <HI>Moderate Men</HI> pre∣vailing,
the Act of <HI>Security</HI> was pass'd in
Parliament, and such <HI>Clauses</HI> were put in,
tho' not the Word <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> express'd,
as the Members thought effectually shut
out the Possibility of Setting up the <HI>Com∣mon-Prayer,</HI>
if the <HI>English</HI> had any Sense of
Honour in them, and would have the least
Regard to the true Design of the Act, as well
as to the Literal Sense; and they thought
that by how much the more Tender they
were of their <HI>Brethren</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in not
putting in the Words <HI>Liturgy,</HI> or <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI>
by so much the more Honourable
the <HI>English</HI> would be to them in any future
Constructions, because they knew the
Grounds on which they had gone, and how
they had answe'd for the <HI>English</HI> to the
dissatisfy'd People.</P>
<P>But Sense of <HI>Honour,</HI> and just Allowance
to a <HI>Generous Confidence,</HI> however at other
Times they may take Place, at a Time when
a Nation is possess'd with Prejudices, and
guided by Parties, these Things are not
heard.</P>
<P>However, because these two Contradicti∣ons
may stand just opposite to one another,
I think the room well taken up to incert
here the said <HI>Church Act</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which,
the Words <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> and Toleration
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
excepted, is as full as the Wit of Man can
invent, and if the other Act passes the En∣glish
Parliament, for, at the Writing, of this,
it is yet Depending before the Lords, I shall
either recite or abridge that also, and then
draw some brief Remarks from the Whole.
The Act of <HI>Security</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> runs thus:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Here follows the Tenour of the Act for Se∣curing
the Protestant Religion, and
Presbyterian Church Government.</HEAD>
<P>“OUR Sovereign Lady and the Estates of
Parliament considering, That by the
late Act of Parliament for a Treaty with
<HI>England,</HI> for an <HI>Union</HI> of both Kingdoms, it's
provided, That the Commissioners for that <HI>Trea∣ty</HI>
should not treat of, or Concerning any Al∣teration
of the <HI>Worship, Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>
of the <HI>Church</HI> of this Kingdom, as now by Law
Establish'd; which <HI>Treaty</HI> being now Reported
to the Parliament, and it being Reasonable and
Necessary, That the true <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> as
presently professed within 'this Kingdom, with
the <HI>Worship, Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of this
<HI>Church,</HI> should be effectually, and unalterably
Secur'd: Therefore Her Majesty, with Advice
and Consent of the States of Parliament, doth
hereby Establish and Confirm the said True
<HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and the Worship, <HI>Discipline,</HI>
and <HI>Government</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI> to continue
without Alteration to the People of this Land,
in all succeeding Generations: And, more e∣specially,
Her Majesty, with Advice and Con∣sent
aforesaid, Ratifies, Approves, and for ever
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
Confirms the Fifth Act of the First Parliament
of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Entitled, <HI>Act
Ratifying the Confession of Faith, and Settling
Presbyterian-Church-Government,</HI> with the Haill
other Acts of Parliament relating thereto, in
Prosecution of the Declaration of the States of
this Kingdom, Containing the Claim of Right,
bearing Date the 11th of <HI>April,</HI> 1699. And
Her Majesty, with Advice and Consent fore∣said,
expresly Provides and Declares, that the
foresaid True <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> Contain'd in
the above-mention'd <HI>Confission of Faith,</HI> with the
<HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Worship,</HI> presently in Use
within this Church and its <HI>Presbyterian-Church-Government</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> that is to say, the
Government of the Church by <HI>Kirk Sessions,
Presbyteries, Provincial Synods,</HI> and <HI>General As∣semblies,</HI>
all Establish'd by the foresaid Acts of
Parliament, pursuant to the Claim of Right,
shall Remain and Continue Unalterable; And
that the said <HI>Presbyterian Government</HI> shall be the
only Government of the Church, within the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and further, for the
greater Security of the foresaid Protestant Reli∣gion,
and of the <HI>Worship, Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>
of this <HI>Church,</HI> as above Establish'd, Her
Majesty, with Advice and Consent aforesaid,
Statutes and Ordains, That the Universities
And Colledges of St. <HI>Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen,</HI>
and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as now Establish'd by Law, shall
continue within this Kingdom for ever; And
that in all Times Coming, no Professors, Prin∣cipals,
Regents, Masters, or others bearing Of∣fice
in any University, Colledge or School
within this Kingdom, be capable to be Admit∣ted,
or Allowed to continue in the Exercise of
their said Functions, but such as shall own and
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
acknowledge the <HI>Civil Government</HI> in manner
prescrib'd or to be prescribed to the Acts of Par∣liament.
As also, that before or at their Ad∣missions,
they do and shall Acknowledge and
Profess, and shall Subscribe to the foresaid Con∣fession
of <HI>Faith,</HI> as the Confession of their <HI>Faith,</HI>
and that they will Practice and Conform them∣selve
to the Worship presently in Use in this
Church, and submit themselve to the Govern∣ment
and Discipline thereof, and never Endea∣vour
Directly or Indirectly, the Prejudice or
Subversion of the same, and that before the
respective <HI>Presbyteries</HI> of their Bounds, by what∣soever
Gift, Presentation or Provision they may
be thereto provided.”</P>
<P>“And further, Her Majesty by Advice afore∣said,
expresly Declares and Statutes, That none
of the Subjects of this Kingdom shall be liable
to, but all and every one of them for ever, free
of an Oath, Test, or Subscription within this
Kingdom, contrary to, or Inconsistent with the
aforesaid True <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and <HI>Presbyteri∣an
Church-Government, Worship,</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> as
above Establish'd: And that the same within
the Bounds of this Church and Kingdom, shall
never be Impos'd or Required of them in any
sort; and lastly, That after the Decease of Her
present Majesty, (whom God long preservex the
Sovereign Succeeding to Her, in the Royal Go∣vernment
of the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> shall
in all Time coming, at His or Her Accession
to the Throne, Swear and Subscribe, That they
shall inviolably Preserve and Maintain the a∣foresaid
Settlement of the True <HI>Protestant Reli∣gion,</HI>
with the <HI>Government, Worship, Discipline,
Right</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> of this Church as above
Establish'd by the Laws of this Kingdom, in
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>
Prosecution of the Claim of Right. And 'tis
hereby Statuted and Ordained, that this Act of
Parliament with the Establishment therein con∣tain'd,
shall be held and observ'd in all Time
coming, as a Fundamental and Essential Con∣dition
of any <HI>Treaty</HI> or <HI>Union,</HI> to be Concluded
betwixt the Two Kingdoms, without any Al∣teration
thereof, or Derogation thereto, in any
sort for ever; as also, that this Act of Parlia∣ment
and Settlement therein contain'd, shall
be Inserted and Repeated in any Act of Parlia∣ment
that shall pass for Agreeing and Conclu∣ding
the aforesaid <HI>Treaty</HI> or <HI>Union</HI> betwixt the
Two Kingdoms; and that the same shall be
therein declared expresly to be a Fundamental
and Essential Condition of the said Treaty or
<HI>Union,</HI> in all Time coming. Which Articles
of <HI>Union,</HI> and Act immediately above written,
Her Majesty with Advice and Content afore∣said,
Statutes, Enacts and Ordains, to be and
continue in all Time coming, the sure and per∣petual
Foundation of a compleat and entire
Union between Both Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>England,</HI> under this express Condition and Pro∣vision,
That the Approbation and Ratification
of the aforesaid Articles and Act, shall be no
ways binding on this Kingdom, until the said
Articles and Act, be Ratified, Approved, and
Confirmed by Her Majesty, with and by the
Authority of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> as they
are now Agreed to, Approved and Confirmed
by Her Majesty, with and by the Authority
of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland;</HI> Declaring never∣theless,
That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> may
provide for the Security of the Church of Eng∣land
as they shall think expedient, to take Place
within the said Bounds of the Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>
and not derogating from the Security a∣bove
provided, for Establishing the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> within the Bounds of this Kingdom;
as also the laid Parliament of <HI>England</HI> may
extend the Additions and other Provisions; con∣tain'd
in the Articles of the <HI>Union,</HI> as above in∣serted,
in Favour of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
and in Favour of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> which
shall not suspend or derogate from the Force
and Effect of this present Ratification, but shall
be understood as herein included, without the
Necessity of any New Ratification in the Par∣liament
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and lastly, Her Majesty
Enacts and Declares, That all Laws and Sta∣tutes
in this Kingdom, so far as they are con∣trary
to, and inconsistent with the Terms of
these Articles above-mention'd, shall, from and
after the <HI>Union,</HI> cease and become void.”</P>
<P>No Man ill <HI>Scotland</HI> thought but the
<HI>Common-Prayer-Rook</HI> and <HI>Episcopacy</HI> were
buried alive in this Act, and the <HI>Episcopal</HI>
Party themselve concluded themselves lost
by it, and therefore, with all their Might,
oppos'd the <HI>Union,</HI> as a Thing which effectu∣ally
foreclos'd them, and cut off all Hopes
of their ever being able to restore their Af∣fairs
again in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and, I believe, any
Man that reads it, will allow that the Wit of
Man could not devise a Thing fuller and
firmer for the Settling and Establishing any
<HI>Constitution</HI> in the World, especially having
to do with Nations that profess'd <HI>Christianity,</HI>
and valu'd themselve upon the Honour and
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>
Justice of their <HI>Proceedings</HI> in all Things of
this Kind; and to give you one convincing
Proof that it was thought so, even by the
<HI>Church of England Men</HI> themselve, you will
find that whereas by the Act of <HI>Ratification</HI>
in <HI>Scotland</HI> there was a Blank left, with
these Words preceeding.</P>
<P>Declaring, nevertheless, That the Parlia∣ment
of, <HI>England</HI> may provide for the Secu∣rity
of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as they
think expedient to take Place within the
Bounds of the said Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI>
and not Derogating from the Security above∣provided,
for Establishing of the <HI>Church of
Scotland</HI> within the Bounds of this King∣dom.
Which Blank the <HI>English</HI> Parliament was
to fill up with such an Act or Clause for
the Security of the <HI>English Church,</HI> as they
thought fit; the Bishops, to whom that
Thing was referr'd, Thinking it impossible
to do any Thing more Secure, they fill'd
up that Blank with an Act of <HI>Security</HI> for
the <HI>Church of England</HI> in the very same
Form, and in the very same Terms, <HI>mu∣tatis
mutandis,</HI> as the <HI>Church of Scotland</HI> had
done before them, as may appear by the
<HI>Exemplification.</HI> [Vid. <HI>Collection of Ori∣ginal
Papers relating to the</HI> Union. Part
Vth, <HI>Fol.</HI> 120—</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="148"/>
This, I say, is a most convincing Proof
that even the <HI>Church of England</HI> thought
this Act of <HI>Security</HI> an effectual sufficient
Establishment for the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI>
and I make no Doubt the Enemies of both
thought it so too.</P>
<P>But what can be made so Strong and
Lasting by Men, but may, by Men, be bro∣ken
in upon? And when Men, wanting
Principle, but having Power, think fit to
fall upon any weaker Body, we very rare∣ly
find they are at a Loss for an Occasion.
What the Pretences which were made the
Reasons of what follow'd in this Case were,
how weak, ill-grounded, and how incon∣sistent with the <HI>Treaty of Union</HI> will appear
in the following Part of this Work; but
first it may be necessary to give a Summary
<HI>Account</HI> of the Juncture in which these
Things happen'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of Scotland</HI> had had little or
no Concern in all the <HI>Politick Bustle</HI> at
Court, of which we have an Account in the
preceeding Chapter, other than as the <HI>Scots,</HI>
influenc'd by the People here of their own
Nation, fell too much in with the Hurry
Things were in at the Election of the <HI>Par∣liament</HI>
aforesaid. The <HI>Commoners</HI> of that
Parliament were not so effectually chang'd,
and a great many of the Old People came
into the House, so that the <HI>Whiggs</HI> might
be said to have the Majority. But the
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>
Election of Peers went quite another Way,
and being manag'd by the D—of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>le</HI>
and his Two close Allies <HI>J</HI>—<HI>a</HI> and <HI>M</HI>—-<HI>r,</HI>
they made a List of such as they thought
proper, and rather nam'd them to the Ge∣neral
Meeting of the No—ty, than gave
them a Freedom of Choice. It is true, this
was not without a 'warm Opposition; and
had not many been so aw'd in it by the
Conduct, the Menaces, and the other Ma∣nagement
of a <HI>P</HI>—<HI>ty,</HI> it had not been easie
to have brought the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility in∣to
an Election so inconsistent with their
L—s in that Manner, and so dishonou∣rable
to them in the Introduction: But this
was no Time to complain, or, at least, to be
redress'd. The Nomination, or List, being
presented at the Meeting of the Lords, was
Voted, the <HI>Whigg</HI> Lords Protesting against
it as no <HI>Free Election,</HI> and Refusing to ap∣pear
at the Place.</P>
<P>Were the high Performances, as well as
the Characters, of these Men enquir'd into,
a few excepted, it need not be wonder'd if
they merited from the <HI>High Party</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to be gratify'd in any Thing they should
demand; and as they fell in directly with
the <HI>October Club,</HI> a Sort of <HI>Mad-men,</HI> who
made themselve the Subject of a History at
that Time, and appearing active in the
worst Drudgery of that <HI>Party,</HI> it could not
be deny'd that it was a Debt to their Per∣formances
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
that the said <HI>October Club Men</HI>
should again give their Votes to their New
<HI>Northern Confederates</HI> in any Thing they
should offer, tho' <HI>Leagues, Treaties, Acts of
Parliament, Union,</HI> or any Thing else stood
in the Way.</P>
<P>This being the Cafe, what had the <HI>Church
of Scotland</HI> to expect from the Adherents of
the New Chosen <HI>Party,</HI> or such of them as
above, who were <HI>Jacobite</HI> in <HI>Practice, Episco∣pal</HI>
in <HI>Principle,</HI> together with some of very
little, if any <HI>Principle</HI> at all: These flock up
to <HI>Court,</HI> and as they had long waited for
an Occasion against the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the
<HI>Church,</HI> the Devil seem'd now to have fur∣nish'd
them to their Hearts Content.</P>
<P>It had been long since they had univer∣sally
vow'd the <HI>Church</HI> a Cast of their Of∣fice,
if ever it lay in their Power; and since
the <HI>Union</HI> had Confederated them with an
<HI>Episcopal Church</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> they fail'd not
to make their <HI>Court</HI> to it upon all Occasi∣ons,
and by two Arguments which deluded
very many in <HI>England,</HI> who saw not
the Design, nor were let into the Secret of
the <HI>Party.</HI> These Arguments were;</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Their being grievously Oppress'd and
Persecuted by the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> for
their <HI>Consciences,</HI> and allow'd no <HI>To∣leration.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Their being a <HI>Sister-Church,</HI> and de∣sirous
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
to be farther United, and more
nearly related by Embracing the <HI>En∣lish
Liturgy.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P><HI>Charity</HI> mov'd many in <HI>England</HI> to con∣cern
themselve for them, on the first of
these Considerations and Zeal for the <HI>Com∣mon
Prayer</HI> put forward others; and it will
be very hard for me, in this narrow Com∣pass,
to describe fully all the Mischiefs these
Two led our People into, which themselves
had no Thought or Design to have been
concern'd in.</P>
<P>The first Step they took, on the Head of
Persecution, was to make a piteous Repre∣sentation
of the <HI>Poverty</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> of the
dispossess'd <HI>Clergy</HI> under the grievous <HI>Per∣secution</HI>
of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and to get Her
Majesty's License for making a Collection
for their Relief all over <HI>England;</HI> which
they did with great Success, if their own
Boasts may be believ'd, I mean the Boasts of
the <HI>English Clergy,</HI> in which, however this
Difficulty lies before us, that if the <HI>English
Clergy</HI> receiv'd what many of them boasted
of, it ill agreed with the Accounts of what
the <HI>Scots Clergy</HI> really receiv'd from them,
since this Author having seen the Books
which the Persons appointed in <HI>Scotland</HI> to re∣ceive
and distribute the said <HI>Charity</HI> kept, the
Whole never amounted, <HI>Commmunibus Annis,</HI>
to above 500<HI>l.</HI> a Year, one Year excepted, when
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>
it came to 700 and some odd Pounds;
whereas in <HI>England</HI> many Thousand Pounds
were Collected, or else those that spoke
loudest spoke—<HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Of which
the World may hear further in Time.</P>
<P>In these Collections great Exclamations
were made at the <HI>Scots</HI> for Persecuting, Op∣pressing,
and cruel Dealing with the <HI>Episco∣pal
Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to excite the
Charity of the People on one Hand, but as
seem'd by their manner more still on the o∣ther
Hand for the aggravating the Temper of
the People against the <HI>Scots, qua Presbyterian;</HI>
nor was this use fail'd to be made of it, <HI>viz.</HI>
that they might see what sort of People the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> were, when they had the Power
in their Hands, and how, altho' they made
loud Clamours here, upon the least Invasion of
their Liberty, yet, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they
had the Power in their own Hands, they
Persecuted the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> with all
the Severity and Rigour imaginable; this
was the constant Discourse of our People
here, at that time, and which is believ'd by
many among us to this Day.</P>
<P>It cannot, therefore, but be necessary, both
in Justice to the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and al∣so
for the Information of those who have
been impos'd upon, to set this Matter in a
True Light, that every one may judge of
the Truth, and the World be no longer im∣pos'd

that we may know directly what to judge

<PB N="144" REF="155"/>
I said in the Close of the last Chapter, we
ought to enquire into two Things:</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Into the true State of the Conduct of
the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to
the Dispossess'd <HI>Episcopal</HI> People, and

</LIST></Q>
<P>1. <HI>Into the true State of the Conduct of
the</HI> Presbyterian Church <HI>in</HI> Scotland, <HI>to the
Dispossess'd</HI> Episcopal <HI>People, and to their
Ministers.</HI> In order to this we shall go
back to the <HI>Revolution</HI> only; for there, and
not before, the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had Power to
act as a Body As soon as the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> was Landed in <HI>England,</HI> King <HI>James</HI>
Fled, and the <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> of that
Reign seem'd to have an End; when the
<HI>Convention</HI> of Estates of Scotland were as∣sembled
by the Encouragement of, and De∣claration
from the said Prince: The People
took Arms in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Recovery of
their <HI>Liberties,</HI> as they had done in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It may be true, that when the People
were thus Universally free, and Arms were
in the Hands of the Common People, that
they immediately apply'd themselve in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as they in <HI>England</HI> had shew'd
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>
them the Way, to rid themselves of the
<HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Episcopal</HI> Party, who had so
bloodily Rul'd them, been a Terror to them;
had put so many of them to Torments and
Death; and to whom, as well as to their
Profession in Religion, <HI>viz. Episcopacy,</HI> or
<HI>Prelacy,</HI> they had the utmost Aversion.</P>
<P>And considering that there were few Fami∣lies
left but some of whose near Friends had
been put to Death, Banish'd, Tortur'd, or Plun∣der'd,
and Impoverish'd by that very <HI>Party,</HI> and
some by the same Persons then Living among
them, it seems rather to be wonder'd that,
when the <HI>Common People</HI> had the full Liberty
of <HI>Treating</HI> them as they pleas'd, they did
not tear them to Pieces, than that they did
dispossess and drive them from among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of England Men</HI> in <HI>England</HI>
cannot joyn in that Exclamation against the
Poor People of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Extravagan∣cies
of their said Rabbles at that Time, since
the Rabbles, and Tumults in <HI>England,</HI> tho'
having by no Means the Pretence of like
Provocation, exercis'd much more <HI>Violence</HI>
and <HI>Fury</HI> on the same Occasion, such as Pil∣laging
the Houses of Foreign Ambassadors;
Laying waste the Fields and Parks of the
Gentry, and Plundering the Dwelling-Houses of many who had no Concern in
the Oppression of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; but
that, by the Way, only to our People in
<HI>England,</HI> it may be said, that it is <HI>ad Hominem</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
to them, and may serve effectually to stop
their Mouths in this Matter.</P>
<P>But, to come to the Point, in this Tu∣mult,
upon the first Heat of the <HI>Revolution,</HI>
it is acknowledg'd, That in the West of
<HI>Scotland, viz.</HI> in the Shires of <HI>Air, Galway,
Dumfries,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>Curates,</HI> or <HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI>
were, <HI>brevi manu,</HI> Dispossess'd, turn'd Out,
and sent away from their Livings, not En∣quiring
whether they would Conform to
the future Establishment or no: For in that
Heat, as is most natural to suppose, the En∣quiry
was rather what they had been, than
what they would promise to be hereafter:
This is Acknowledging as much as the
worst Enemy can charge; and all the loudest
Clamour which they make of the Violence
of the Rabble against some of those Ministers
might be thus answer'd from themselves, if
they would sincerely, from their Consciences,
ask, and reply uprightly to this Question;
1. Reflecting on the Usage the Poor People
had suffer'd; the Persecution they had under∣gone;
the Blood that had been spilt, and the
Losses they had sustain'd; to which even ma∣ny
of these Ministers had been assistant and
accessory; and, considering the unrestrain'd
Power the Poor People at that Time had
Whether they did not wonder that they
came off so well, and whether the Ministers
of that Side did not expect much worse from
their Hands? And 2. Whether the <HI>Church of
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
England</HI> Rabbles, at the same Time, and upon
the same Occasion, did not commit a Thou∣sand
greater Violences, and more extravagant,
tho' with far less Provocation? These are, as
I said above, <HI>ad Hominem</HI> in this Case: And
after all that has been complain'd of, this is
certain, and to me, I confess, no less won∣derful
that there was no Blood shed, no Life,
lost in the whole Affair; which, if the Tables
were turn'd, as God forbid, and the other
Party were uppermost, and had the same
Power, I believe the Gentlemen we are
Speaking of would not answer for.</P>
<P>In this Hurry therefore, as I said before,
several of the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> were turn'd
out of their Parishes and Livings by Vio∣lence,
and it was a Wonder it was no worse.
But this can by no means be laid to the
Charge of the <HI>Presbyterian Church Settlement,</HI>
for they were not settled or establish'd in any
Legal Form 'till the Year after, <HI>viz.</HI> the Year
1689, when the Fifth Act of the Second
Session of the First Parliament of <HI>William</HI> and
<HI>Mary,</HI> entituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confession
of Faith, and Settling</HI> Presbyterian Church
Government, was pass'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Now
let us enquire critically into the Conduct of
the <HI>Church</HI> as <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and as vested
with <HI>Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction,</HI> and then, if
any Appearance of <HI>Persecution</HI> is to be found,
it will lie fairly against them. The first
Act after the Settlement of the <HI>Presbyterian
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>
Church</HI> was, indeed, to empower all these
Ministers of the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> who
were possess'd of Livings at the Restoration,
(1661) and were turn'd out, and were then
Living, to return and repossess them. This
was but an Act of Justice to restore Men to
those Rights from which (by their Consti∣tution)
they suppos'd them violently and un∣justly
thrown out: But, alas! If this be the
Persecution they mean, how few, could it be
suppos'd, were to be found, which the Gal∣lows,
the Tortures, the Murtherings in cold
Blood, the Drowning, the Banishment of the
<HI>Episcopal Persecutors,</HI> had left alive; or who,
in 28 Years Time, for so long the Reign of
<HI>Episcopal Cruelty</HI> lasted, were not worn out
by Age, and sent to Rest in their Graves, so
that I believe I speak within Compass if I
say that not Fifty <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI>
were to be found who claim'd the Possession
of Benefices by that Act.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> being now settled, even the
Nature of the Thing prevented them hastily
Turning out the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> for
Twenty Eight Years Persecution, and espe∣cially
a Persecution so cruel, and so severe,
had worn out even the Race of <HI>Presbyterian
Pastors,</HI> and there were not enough to be
found to supply the <HI>Churches;</HI> this, I say,
even by the Nature of the Thing, prevent∣ed
any immediate general Prosecution of the
Design for Dispossessing the <HI>Episcopal Mi∣nisters;</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>
but, after this, as a Testimony of
the <HI>Moderation</HI> of a <HI>Presbyterian Government,</HI>
and to shew them that nothing but a just
Settlement of Things was aim'd at, with as
little Oppression of the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> as
was possible, an <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament was pass'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> The 27th <HI>Act</HI> of the Fifth Session of
the First Paliament of King <HI>William</HI> and
Queen <HI>Mary, Anno</HI> 1695, and entitl'd, <HI>Act
concerning the Church;</HI> by which all <HI>Episco∣pal
Ministers</HI> who were possess'd of Livings
and Benefices in <HI>Scotland</HI> were allow'd to
continue in the same upon no other Condi∣tions
but those of Living peaceably under,
and Taking the Oaths to the <HI>Government.</HI>
Now let any Instance of a like <HI>Moderation</HI>
be given in any Parallel Case in the World;
and let any Man judge of the Charge of Per∣secution
cast upon the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI>
After such Dealings and such Connivance.
Here was not so much as an Acknowledg∣ment
of, or <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Presbyterian
Church Government,</HI> no Subscription to <HI>Pres∣byterian
Articles of Faith,</HI> or to any Thing
inconsistent with their own Principles re∣quir'd
of them, as is usual in all such Cases in
other Countries, and is especially in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Pursuant to this Act, a Sixth part of all
the Parishes in <HI>Scotland</HI> were left in the
Hands of the <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and the Few Removes made by Death being
Excepted, they continue so still; and so far
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>
are the said <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI> from paying
any Homage of Principles to the Establish'd
<HI>Church,</HI> that, on the contrary, they own and
continue themselves <HI>Episcopal;</HI> and the <HI>Presby∣terians</HI>
assemble in private Meetings-Houses
in some of the same Towns under them, like
meer <HI>Dissenters:</HI> This is a Token of Forbear∣ance
that, I presume, no establish'd Church
in <HI>Europe,</HI> this alone excepted, can give an
Example of.</P>
<P>But this is not all: That the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> may be yet more asham'd to charge
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> with being so much
a <HI>Persecutor</HI> as herself, we have another In∣stance
which is very clear, and past all pos∣siblity
of denying: The <HI>Episcopal</HI> People
who were Dispossess'd for refusing to take
the Oaths to the <HI>Government,</HI> soon after this
let up Meetings in all Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in
which they not only set up <HI>Publick Worship,</HI>
and gather'd Congregations, and in some
Few (<HI>very Few</HI>) the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> all
which was directly contrary to the Laws
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Privileges of the <HI>Church,</HI>
and which the <HI>Church</HI> might very readily,
and justly have suppress'd; but in none, or
very few of these would they ever Pray for
the Queen; in many of them they open∣ly
Pray'd for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and in all of
them they pray'd in ambigu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Terms,
such as might clearly evidence that they
meant the <HI>Pretender,</HI> such as praying for
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
<HI>the King,</HI> or <HI>the Queen,</HI> or <HI>the Royal Family,</HI>
and the like; and yet, even for this, did not
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> take the least Cog∣nisance,
or offer them any Disturbance, tho',
at the same Time, the like <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meetings
were, generally speaking, Suppress'd, Di∣sturb'd,
and effectually Scatter'd in <HI>England,</HI>
without the least Complaint, or clamour of
<HI>Persecution;</HI> nor, to this Day, are they al∣low'd
among us. I am the freer to take up
some time on this Head, because I cannot but
think that the Honest, but prejudic'd People
in <HI>England,</HI> who have been imposed upon, by
the publick Cryes of <HI>Sufferings, Persecution,
Cruelties,</HI> and Merciless <HI>Usage</HI> of the <HI>Epis∣copal
Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will, I doubt not,
be pleased to be undeceiv'd, and be glad to
restore the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to their
entire Charity and good Opinion, and to
have that Damp remov'd, which they had
on good Ground, as they suppos'd, felt on
their Thoughts, when they believ'd, that
the Excesses pretended to, had Truth enough
in them to merit real Blame, and that the
Warmth of <HI>Northern Zeal</HI> had carry'd the
<HI>Scots</HI> beyond that Moderation, which is
the Beauty and Glory of the <HI>Protestant
Religion,</HI> and which I doubt not to make
appear, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has given
Reason to believe, she at this time practises,
<HI>and from the Revolution to this time has
done as much as any Church in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="163"/>
'Tis for these Reasons I write; 'tis for the
sake of these this part of <HI>this Book</HI> is publish'd;
'tis to undeceive the Friends to <HI>Truth</HI> and the
Lovers of <HI>Peace;</HI> to remove the <HI>Prejudices</HI>
of those that wou'd be inform'd, not of those
that seek to be imposed upon, and hunt
about for Subject to Cavil and Debate: 'Tis
to clear up the Reputation of the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> among her Friends, not among her
Enemies, among the Friends to Religion in
<HI>England,</HI> and among the <HI>Protestant Churches</HI>
abroad; this is the Reason of this Work,
and the Author professes to have no other
Design.</P>
<P>Not but that it may also serve to stop the
Mouths of some People who, with an <HI>Uncha∣ritable
Zeal,</HI> have rais'd a Cloud, and cast Dirt
on the Establish'd Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> on
this Account, and perhaps they may here
find some Occasion to alter their Measures,
and with respect to their own Reputation
change their Note: For it always weakens
the Reputation of either Person or Party, to
assert <HI>Falshoods,</HI> to raise <HI>Stories</HI> that must, if
Examin'd into, appear to be forged, and con∣trived
only to Defame. And that this may
be effectually done, I shall set down a short
Abstract of the Proceedings of the <HI>Church,</HI>
with relation to their own Settlement, taken
from sufficient Authorities, as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Government</HI> was no sooner Esta∣blish'd
by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Kirk</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>
Restor'd to her <HI>Judicatories</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI>
but her several Courts as <HI>Session, Presbytery,
Synod,</HI> and <HI>Assembly,</HI> took their Courses and
began to Act.</P>
<P>By the first Act of Parliament for set∣tling
these Matters, pass'd <HI>June</HI> 7. 1690,
Intituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confession of
Faith, and Settling Presbyterian Church
Government,</HI> It is Ordain'd, <HI>That the Ge∣neral
Assembly the Ministers and Elders,
should have Power to try and purge out all</HI>
Insufficient, Scandalous <HI>and</HI> Erroneous Mi∣nisters,
<HI>by due Course of Ecclesiastick Pro∣cess,
and Censures;</HI> But this Act no where
Impower'd them to Censure any who were
not <HI>Insufficient, Scandalous</HI> or <HI>Erroneous,</HI>
tho' they would not take the Oaths to the
<HI>Government.</HI> So that, by this Law, the
Church could not be capable of <HI>Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be <HI>Epis∣copal,</HI>
might be adjudged <HI>Erroneous</HI> by this
<HI>Judicatory,</HI> and so come under the Church
Censure, by Authority of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis Replyed. First, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No
Man was ever since the <HI>Revolution,</HI> Deposed
by the Church, meerly for being <HI>Episcopal,</HI>
nor was any Process ever commenc'd against
any Man on that Foundation.</P>
<P>And here by the way, if this be true, as I
can challenge the World to contradict it, I
would humbly recommend it to those Gen∣tlemen
who are now in <HI>England</HI> raising
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
<HI>Charities,</HI> and obtaining <HI>Contributions,</HI> preten∣ing
it is for the Relief of the Poor Distressed
Episcopal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who are suf∣fering
<HI>Persecution,</HI> to tell the World, what
it is they are persecuted for.</P>
<P>And the Gentlemen who bestow their
<HI>Charity,</HI> would do well to require some
Documents or Certificates of them, to prove
the Particulars; And especially one exceed∣ing
busy <HI>Solicitor</HI> for those <HI>Charities,</HI> and
who stiles himself a <HI>Persecuted Episcopal
Minister,</HI> whose Name may in time be
made more publick, would do well to tell
them, whether he was <HI>Deprived,</HI> which he
calls <HI>Persecution,</HI> for his <HI>Conscience,</HI> or his
<HI>Vice;</HI> for his <HI>Religion,</HI> or for his <HI>Morals;</HI>
for <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> or for Relapse <HI>Fornication.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> To put this out of Question,
it was particularly Declared by the First
General Assembly after the Revolution, <HI>viz.</HI>
In the Sixth Session, in the Year 1690, <HI>That
this Assembly will Depose no Incumbents sim∣ply
for their Judgment anent the Government
of the Church, nor Urge Re-ordination upon
them. Vid. Index</HI> of the Unprinted Acts of
the Assembly, <HI>Sess.</HI> 6. 1690.</P>
<P>In the same Assembly, in their Instructi∣ons
given to their Commission, which was
to sit during their Recess, we have these
Words,</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiv∣ing
Informations against the late Conformists;
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>
And that they proceed in the Matter of Cen∣sure
very Deliberately, so as none may have
Just Cause to Complain of their Regedity;
And that they shall not proceed to Censure, but
upon <HI>Relevant Libels</HI> and Sufficieut Probation,
<HI>Act 15th. Sess. 26th, Assembly</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>Again, lest the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> should be Rash
or Severe, the Commission is impower'd as
follows, That if they shall be inform'd of any
precipitant Procedure of the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> in
such Processes, to Restrain them. Vid. <HI>the
same Act as above.</HI></P>
<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in
Scandalous Things, and Declared against
proceeding hastily or severely in Cases meer∣ly
<HI>Episcopal,</HI> where shall we find the Article
of <HI>Persecution?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, That, in the Year 1693, an Act
of Parliament was made to Deprive all such
Ministers as would not both Swear to the
<HI>Government,</HI> and Acknowledge the <HI>Church
Government</HI> also, and the <HI>Confession of Faith.</HI>
But the Occasion of this Act is Visible to all
that know the Affairs of that Time, that it
was pass'd to satisfy the Minds of the People,
who were exceedingly Disturb'd at the
Church's having been Insulted in the Assem∣bly
1692, by a general <HI>Formula,</HI> procured by
the <HI>Episcopal Clergy,</HI> together with their Ap∣peal
to the King on a Refusal: And the As∣sembly
being abruptly Dissolved, or Dismissed
<HI>sine die,</HI> which put the Nation in a very
great Fermentation.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="167"/>
Yet, upon this Act, I may challenge the
<HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI> to show me one Minister,
that ever was Deposed for not acknowledg∣ing
the <HI>Church,</HI> if at the same he offer'd to
acknowledge the <HI>Government,</HI> and take the
Oaths, and they have been often challenged
on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice
by a Law, that Famous Act of Parliament
was made in the Year 1695, wherein taking
the Oaths to the Government is made the
<HI>Only</HI> and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI> Qualification, and
all Ministers that would so <HI>Qualifie them∣selves</HI>
are continued. As may be seen at
large by the Act, Intituled, Act <HI>concerning
the Church, Anno</HI> 1695.</P>
<P>This very Act of Parliament, if I were to
go no further, effectually clears the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Charge of <HI>Persecution;</HI>
since 'tis plain there was no religious Tenet
in Dispute, but a civil Question of owning
or not owning the <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken
quite out of the Power of the <HI>Church,</HI> to
Depose any Man meerly for being <HI>Episcopal</HI>
in <HI>Principle,</HI> or for refusing to own the <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI>
Church; nay, the <HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI>
who, by virtue of this Act, remain in their
Livings, many of them to this Day, refuse
to acknowledge the <HI>Church,</HI> to submit to
any of Her <HI>Judicatories,</HI> or to joyn, either
in <HI>Discipline</HI> or <HI>Worship;</HI> and yet, in all their
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>
Affronts of the Establish'd Church, they
continue in their Paroches, preaching and
using all their Formalities; however, con∣trary
to the Inclinations and Desires of the
People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI>'s power to Persecute, being
thus limited by Act of Parliament, it remains
to examine, in what manner she has exer∣cis'd
that Power she had; for in this Article
must lie the Matter of this Charge, or they
must have more than a Spirit of Divination
that can find it out.</P>
<P>In order to this, I must enquire what this
Power they had was, and that is a very
short Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estion: Their Power, 'tis plain,
was only against such Ministers who were
<HI>Scandalous,</HI> &amp;c. or would not take the Oaths
to the <HI>Government,</HI> nor pray for King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they were, or were not absolute∣ly
bound up to Censure all such as would
not thus qualifie themselves, is a Question I
shall speak to hereafter.</P>
<P>It follows to Examine how the <HI>Church</HI>
has Executed this Power; and whether
<HI>Lenity</HI> or <HI>Severity</HI> has been her Temper in
the Case; and to state this, as clearly as pos∣sible,
I must make the Gentlemen one fair
Proposal.</P>
<P>Before I enter'd upon this Work, I not
only search'd into all the Publick Records
of this Matter, which I could have Access
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>
to, but made as strict Enquiry, as possibly I
could, of the most Impartial and Unbyass'd
Persons for any particular Case, wherein any
Excurtion might have been beyond this
Power, or wherein the Charge of <HI>Persecution</HI>
might lie. And this with the utmost Im∣partiality,
and not being able to find any
Thing.</P>
<P>Thus stands the Article of the Behaviour
of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> towards the <HI>Epis∣copal</HI>
Dissenters, even at the Time when we
are now passing at Act of Parliament to pre∣vent
the said <HI>Church</HI> persecuting the other.
Hour far, even the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People them∣selves
will think fit to Laugh at that Pre∣tence,
brought into the Title of a Law, I
leave to them; no doubt but it is Diverting
enough to them to have so effectually impos'd
upon us in <HI>England</HI> about these Things.</P>
<P>It might have been needful to have Incer∣ted
here the Names of the Persons now en∣joying
Parishes and Benefices in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
who yet are <HI>Episcopal</HI> in their Perswasion,
and who do not acknowledge the <HI>Presbyterian
Church Government,</HI> and yet are continu'd,
with the Names of the Parishes, the Number
of which were at first 163, and are still, Death
having, in Twenty Two Years time, taken
many away, above 100: But having not
room in this Tract, and having publish'd the
same List in another small Tract; as also
the <HI>Church</HI> Registers being always capable of
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>
proving the Fact, I omit it, referring the In∣credulous
to inform themselves of any that
are Conversant at <HI>Edinb.</HI> and appealing even
to the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Ministers themselves, who
I believe will not deny it.</P>
<P>2. I proceed in the next Place, to examine
the Conduct and Behaviour of the <HI>Episcopal</HI>
People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in return for the For∣bearance
and Lenity above; and for the
more clear discovery of this, I think no
better Method can be taken to refer to the
Behaviour of the Gentry and People in the
Affair of <HI>Church Judicatories, Civil Process,</HI>
and the like, wherein the <HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI> are
concern'd, and in the Judical Proceedings of
the <HI>Church</HI> in planting vacant Churches, set∣tling
Ministers, and the like; as also about
Intrusion into Churches, Manses, or Parson∣age-Houses,
and the like.</P>
<P>In general it is well known, that all pos∣sible
<HI>Opposition,</HI> Insults of <HI>Publick Judicature,</HI>
Contempt of <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> even
to <HI>Violence,</HI> breach of the <HI>Laws,</HI> breach of
the <HI>Peace. Rabble, Tumult,</HI> and <HI>Barbarity</HI>
has been the Return made by the <HI>Episcopal
Party,</HI> for the <HI>Lenity</HI> and <HI>Forbearance</HI> afore∣said;
and this in several Particulars, too
long to recite here: yet I cannot agree to pass
such a General, without entering into some
Particulars, in order to make a Proof of
the Whole; lest affirming, in gross may be
thought sufficiently answer'd, by denying in
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>
Gross; wherefore, that the Thing may car∣ry
its own Evidence with itself, I shall give
One or Two Instances out of many that
might be named to confirm this Head.</P>
<P>But before I descend to these Particulars,
it is first requisite to note from whence these
<HI>Episcopal</HI> Men took Encouragement to this
Way of Behaviour under an establish'd <HI>Con∣stitution,</HI>
and against severe <HI>Laws</HI> made a∣gainst
them; which <HI>Laws,</HI> had they been
rigorously Executed, must have effectually
suppress'd them long ago. In order to this,
it is necessary to note, That, during the
Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> all their Designs
meeting with a visible Discouragement, they
saw little Hopes of breaking thorough the
<HI>Constitution,</HI> and therefore were less frequent
in their Attempts; and acted with more
Modesty and Caution in their Encroachments
upon the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> of the <HI>Na∣tional
Church;</HI> nor had they many Meet∣ing-Houses
erected in that Reign. Indeed,
the Act of Parliament 1695, allowing all to
keep their Parishes and Stations in the <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI>
tho' they were <HI>Episcopal,</HI> provided
they would take the Oaths to the <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI>
of which I made mention before, took
away from them all appearance of reason for
their <HI>Discontents;</HI> for no <HI>Government</HI> could
think it reasonable to allow a Liberty to
those who, at the same time, refused to give
reasonable Assurances of their Fidelity to
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>
that <HI>Government,</HI> and therefore, in that
Reign they lay pretty Quite, hoping, as they
said, for better Times.</P>
<P>No sooner was King <HI>William</HI> in his Grave,
but they began to take Courage; and enter∣taining
new Hopes, from, the first Advances
made in the beginning of Her Majesty's Reign
towards a <HI>High-Party</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> of which
I have spoken at large in the first Chapter,
they promis'd themselves great Things,
and began to make some Steps towards
Measures they had in view.</P>
<P>The first Step they took, wad to make
their Court to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> call∣ing
themselves, <HI>their Sister Church,</HI> of the
same Profession, and persecuted by <HI>Presbyte∣rians,</HI>
for adhereing to the <HI>Principles</HI> which
the <HI>Church of England</HI> profess'd; and, that
this might appear more and more, they ap∣ply'd
themselves to the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, pro∣mising
them to introduce the <HI>English Litur∣gy</HI>
into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and to that Purpose re∣ceiv'd
from the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> large num∣bers
of <HI>Common-Prayer-Books,</HI> as a Charita∣ble
<HI>Contribution, ad propoganda side,</HI> to be
given among the poor Peaple, whom they,
<HI>tho' falsly,</HI> represented eagerly desiring that
Holy-Book, and very forward to Receive and
Embrace it; tho' nothing is more true, than
this, that when they had it in the <HI>North</HI> and
<HI>East</HI> Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Chiefs and Lairds
us'd all manner of Violences to bring their
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
Subjects and Vassals to make use of it; of
which hereafter.</P>
<P>This was the first Step: But, as this was
not the End aim'd at; this new Correspon∣dence
was soon improv'd to a most inconsi∣stent
Attempt, and which one would have
thought their New-Correspondents might
have inform'd them of the Impossibility of
bringing to any Head, <HI>viz.</HI> of Addressing
Her Majesty, by Her own Authority (<HI>i. e.</HI>
Dispensing Power) to give them a Tolera∣tion
against Law: The Answer Her Maje∣sty
gave was to this purpose, <HI>That they should
behave themselves Peaceably and Quitely, in
submitting to the Government, and therein
they should be sure of Her Royal favour and
Protection. Vide the</HI> Queen's Answer, pub∣lish'd
in the <HI>Gazette, Janu.</HI> the, 1703.
This was a Disappointment to them; but
they were soon let into the Reason of it,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Nature of the Thing admit∣ted
no other Answere; and that Her Majesty
could not Dispense with the Law. How∣ever,
this did not so baulk them, but that,
in several Places, they, by plain Force, en∣ter'd
into vacant Churches, and kept Posses∣sion
of the same, preaching, and executing
the Ministerial Functions, not only, against
Law, but even without any Legal Quali∣fication;
as aforesaid, not only not Praying
for the Queen, but not taking the Oath, or
subscribing the Assurance; and then, being
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>
in remote Places of the Kingdom, and under
the Protection of the <HI>Lairds</HI> and <HI>Heretors,</HI>
who were professedly <HI>Jacobites,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI>
found it very difficult to remove them; and
indeed, there appear'd no visible Way to
remove them, but the same by which they
got the Possession, <HI>viz.</HI> by Violence; which
was not to be done in those Northern Parts,
without a Military Power, so that many of
these Intruders keep Possession of the said
Churches, and Manses, and Stipends to this
Day; such as,

<P>We are to know, that this Intrusion was
contrary to an Express Act of Parliament, in
the 5th Session of the first Parliament of <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
and <HI>Mary,</HI> Act 22. 1695, entituled, <HI>Act
against Intruding into Churches, without le∣gal

is expresly Enacted thus:</P>

<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
<HEAD>Act against Intruding into Churches without a legal
Call and Admission thereto. <DATE>July 5, 1695.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>“OUr Sovereign Lord considering, That Mi∣nisters
and Preachers, their intruding them∣selves
into vacant Churches; possessing of Manfes,
or Benefices, and exercising any part of the <HI>Mi∣nisterial
Function</HI> in <HI>Paroches,</HI> without a legal Call
and Admission to the said Churches, is an high
Contempt of the Law, and of dangerous Conse∣quences,
tending to perpetuate <HI>Scism;</HI> therefore
his Majesty, with Advice and Consent of the
Estates of Parliament, Statutes and declares,
Thar whoever shall intrude themselves into any
Church, or shall possess Manse, or Benefice,
or shall exercise any part of the Ministerial
Function within any Paroch, without an orderly
Call from the <HI>Heritors</HI> and <HI>Eldership,</HI> and legal
Admission from the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> within whose
Bounds it lies, shall be incapable of enjoying
any Church, or Stipend, or Benefice, within
this Kingdom, for the Space of Seven Years
after their removal from the Church, and
quitting Possession of the Stipend, or Benefice,
into which they intruded: Likewise his Ma∣jesty,
with Advice and Consent aforesaid, does
hereby remit the Execution of this present Act
to <HI>Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bayliffs</HI> of <HI>Bailleries</HI> and <HI>Re∣galities,</HI>
and their Deputs, and to Magistrates
of <HI>Burghs-Royal,</HI> who are hereby authorized and
required to remove, and declare incapable, <HI>ut
Supra,</HI> all those who shall hereafter intrude
into Churches within their respective Juris∣dictions,
upon Complaint from the <HI>Presbytery,</HI>
or any Person having a Warrant from the
<HI>Presbytery</HI> within whose Bounds the said In∣trutions
shall happen, to be made hereafter,
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>
and that upon Citation of ten days: Ordain∣ing
hereby Letters of Horning and Caption, to
be direct in <HI>Communi forma</HI> upon Decrees to
be given by the said inferior Judges, for com∣pelling
the said Intruders to remove from the
said <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Manses,</HI> and to quit Possession
of the said <HI>Stipends,</HI> or Benefices, and to desist
from exercising any Ministerial Acts within
the said Paroches, into which they hereafter
intrude. Likeas, as his Majesty doth all those
who have already, since the Present Establish∣ment
of <HI>Church Government,</HI> intruded into va∣cant
Churches, without an orderly Call from
the <HI>Heritors</HI> and <HI>Eldership</HI> of the Paroch, and a
legal Admission from the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> within
whose Bounds the said Church lies; and also
to take some effectual Course for Stopping and
Hindring those Ministers who are, or shall be
hereafter Depos'd, by the Judicators of this
present Establish'd Church, for preaching, or
exercising any Act of their Ministerial Function,
which they cannot do after they are depos'd
without Contempt of the Authority of the
<HI>Church,</HI> and of the Laws of the Kingdom esta∣blishing
the same.”</P>
<P>But so great was the Resolution of these
People to carry on this Affair, hoping for
Connivance of the Queen, that it began to
be Insufferable; and Complaint being made to
the Government, several Proclamations were,
by Her Majesty's express Order, publish'd
by the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to prevent
it, which, however, had but little Effect.</P>
<P>Thus Matters stood at the Time of the
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>
<HI>Union</HI> of both Kingdoms; which <HI>Union,</HI> as was
particularly observ'd, all the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People,
notwithstanding their pretended Loyalty to
Her Majesty, and Compliment to the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> they most warmly and universally
Oppos'd, as well Privately, by their Interest,
as Publickly by the Tumults, Rabbles, and
Riots of the People, in which they several∣ly
joyn'd, upon all Occasions; as may be
seen at large in the Account of those Rab∣bles,
given at large in the Book before quo∣ted,
Entituled, <HI>Collections of Original Papers,</HI>
&amp;c. <HI>relating to the</HI> Union. <HI>Printed at</HI> Edin.
<HI>in Folio.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Union</HI> being now pass'd, in spight,
as I may say, of all their Opposition, they
continued to improve it to their Advantage;
and to that purpose, went on with their
Court to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> noted be∣fore
to this End. They set on Foot a No∣tion
which they expected something from,
tho' afterwards they dropt it again, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the <HI>Episcopal Church,</HI> as they call'd it,
<HI>of Scotland,</HI> was Incorporated into the <HI>Church
of England</HI> by the <HI>Union;</HI> but this having
no Foundation, fell, as I said, of course. As
to their Design of propagating the <HI>English</HI>
Liturgy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it met with small En∣couragement,
even their own <HI>Nonjurant</HI>
Ministers, who had set up Meeting-Houses
in most Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> generally rejecting
it; and those few who set it up were for∣saken
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
by most of their Hearers; so that all
the Remedy they had, was, as before, to ob∣tain
of their Friends, in the several Coun∣tries,
who were in the Confederacy, to oblige
their Tenants to comply with it, which
they did with all imaginable Rigour, threat∣ning,
and even punishing those that refus'd,
some by putting them out of their Farms;
and others by Imprisoning those who de∣clin'd,
or refus'd it, as particularly at <HI>Fra∣zersburgh,</HI>
and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>But this was not all; the <HI>Church Judi∣catories</HI>
were the next Thing which they
attack'd, and this, in defiance of Law, they
put in practice, by <HI>Riot, Rabble,</HI> and <HI>Tumult,</HI>
and because these Things ought not to be
left on Record, without sufficient Evidence,
I shall confirm every thing by Law, and
proof of Fact as I go.</P>
<P><HI>And first, as to the Law:</HI> The Elventh
Act of the Seventh Session of the First Par∣liament
of King <HI>William, Anno</HI> 1698, enti∣tuled,
<HI>Act for preventing Disorders in the
supplying and planting of vacant Churches,</HI> was
made upon this very Occasion; for it had been
a Practice in that Time, and all along from
the <HI>Revolution,</HI> to Rabble the Ministers and
Presbyteries, when they went about either to
supply, or to plant the vacant Churches; and
this Act, for a Time, did suppress the Practice.
This Act being very particularly Expressive
of the Case I could not omit, and is as follows:</P>

<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
<HEAD>Act for Preventing of Disorders in the Supplying and
Planting of vacant Churches. <DATE>August 30. 1698.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>“OUR Sovereign Lord, wath Advice and
Consent of the Estates of Parliament, for
Redeeming the Godless Abuse of Rabbling, that
of late, hath so frequently happen'd, in Opposi∣tion
to Ministers orderly sent to supply vacant
Churches, and for Facilitating of the Supplying
and Planting of vacant Churches, and Remo∣ving
all Impediments, and Disorders that may
obstruct the same, strictly prohibits and dis∣charges
all Persons whatsoever to make any
Opposition, by Rabbling, Tumult, or any means
of Violence to any Minister, lawfully autho∣rized,
and sent to preach at any vacant Church
within the Kingdom, either for supplying of
the said Vacancy, or to exercise the Ministe∣rial
Function, as fixed Minister of the Paroch,
and that under the Pains of an Hundred Pounds
upon every Heritor, or Life-rentor, and of
Fifty Marks upon any other unlanded Person,
<HI>toties quoties;</HI> and for such Delinquents as are
not able to pay that, they should be punish'd
in their Persons as the Lords of the <HI>Privy-Coun∣cil</HI>
shall see Cause. And further, For the better
Oppressing of the aforesaid Opposition, by
Rabbling, Tumult, or any other Manner of
Violence, his Majesty, with Advice and Con∣sent
aforesaid, ratifies and extends to the Case
thereof, the Seventh Act of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> 1633,
entitl'd <HI>Act anent Invading of Ministers;</HI> and
that, in Manner, and with the Alterations fol∣lowing,
and therefore statutes and ordains,
That where-erer any such Rabble, or Tumults
happen the Heritors and Life-rentors, In whose
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
Bounds, whether within or without the <HI>Paroch,</HI>
any of the Persons Dilated, or Accused as guil∣ty
of, or accessory to the same, Dwells, or Re∣sides,
shall be holden, upon Intimation made to
them by the Minister injur'd, or by any in the
Name of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> who sent him to pro∣duce
the aforesaid Persons guilty, and that they
may be conven'd before the Lords of his Ma∣jesty's
<HI>Privy-Council</HI> for that Effect, certifying
the said <HI>Heretors,</HI> and <HI>Life-rentors,</HI> That if they
either failzie to produce the said Persons, if
Residing within their Bounds when the afore∣said
Intimation shall be made; or if they shall
suffer the said Persons withdrawing, or absent∣ing
the Time of the said Intimation, thereafter
to Reside, and Haunt, openly, within their
Bounds for the Space of Twenty Days, then,
and in these Cases, the said <HI>Heretors</HI> and <HI>Life-rentors,</HI>
shall be esteem'd Connivers with the <HI>De∣linquents,</HI>
and liable as guilty act and part with
them in their aforesaid <HI>Delinquency;</HI> and be∣cause,
notwithstanding the Act, and Proclama∣tion,
and Council, made in the Year 1690, for
Delivering of the Keys of vacant Churches to
the <HI>Presbyteries,</HI> or the Persons having their
Order the <HI>Person's</HI> Havers thereof, do shift the
same from Hand to Hand; therefore his Ma∣jesty,
with Advice and Consent aforesaid, sta∣tutes
and ordains, That where, and whenever,
after Requisition, made by the <HI>Presbytery</HI> to the
<HI>Beddel,</HI> or <HI>Havers,</HI> of the said Keys, the same
are refus'd, and not given up, the next Magi∣strates,
Sheriff, Lord of Regalities, or Bailiff, and
their Deputies, and any Justice of the <HI>Peace,</HI>
when requir'd by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> or any of them,
shall repair to the said <HI>Kirk,</HI> and there make
Open, and Patent the Doors there of, and put new
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>
Locks to the same, and deliver the Keys to the
<HI>Presbytery,</HI> or their Order, for their free Use,
making of the same Certifying the said Inferior
Magistrate who shall refuse, when requir'd to
make the Church patent in Manner aforesaid,
he shall be liable in the Fine of an Hundred
Pounds <HI>Scots,</HI> to be inflicted upon him by the
Lords of the <HI>Privy-Council,</HI> for the Use of the
Poor of the Paroch, by and at our, the <HI>Pesbyte∣teries</HI>
Expences.”</P>
<P>But these People believing that like No∣tice
of these Acts would not be taken, as
formerly had been. The <HI>Union</HI> being made,
and the <HI>Privy-Council</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> being dis∣solv'd,
they fell to the same Method and
Practice of Rabbling, and Insulting the Mi∣nisters
and Church Judicatories, as they had
before; and that with greater Fury than
ever; and as the <HI>Gentry,</HI> the <HI>Lairds,</HI> and
<HI>Heretors</HI> abetted, and even directed the poor
People to it, they were the bolder in it;
assuring them, that <HI>Episcopacy</HI> should quick∣ly
be restor'd, and that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI>
were going down: There are several long
Accounts of this in Print, too long to fill
this Book with, and therefore I omit them,
only the following, because of the Issue
discovering the secret Practice with the poor
People, and how they were forc'd into it, in
Obedience to their Masters and Chiefs; and
because it came to a Determination by the
Submission of the Persons guilty, I could not

<P>“MR. <HI>Thomas Chisholm,</HI> according to Ap∣pointment
of the Presbytery, took Jour∣ney
towards <HI>Gearloch,</HI> about Day
of <HI>February</HI> last, and that Night lodged in the
Country of <HI>Strathwren,</HI> and that upon the Mor∣row,
late at Night, he came to <HI>Kinlochom,</HI> a part
of the Parish of <HI>Gearloch,</HI> belonging to Sir
<HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> from which he design'd
that Night to go, by Boat, to the other end of
the <HI>Loch,</HI> but the People of that Place under∣standing
his Design, stop'd all the Boats, and
shut all their Houses; they would neither af∣ford
him Lodging, nor allow him to cross the
Water towards the Kirk, which oblig'd him to
Travel five Miles in the Night by the <HI>Lock-side,</HI>
and when he hired a Boat in order to go off,
the next Morning, to that part of the Country
where the Kirk lay; but that Night about two
in the Morning, a Party of Armed Men, about
Sixteen in Number, broke up the Door of the
House where he Lodg'd, drag'd his two Servants
by the Heels out of their Beds naked out of the
House, raised himself out of his Bed, and compel'd
him to return with them Ten Miles, before Day∣light,
the same Way from whence he came, and
then left him on a Hill, several Miles from any
House, without Meat or Drink; and one of his
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
Servants fainted that Night, his Guard would
not allow him (tho' he had come to the Door
of a House where they sold Liquor) to take a
Dram thereof to refresh himself, or revive his
Servant, but told him they did him but too
great a Complement when they suffer'd him
to live, so that he was necessitate to leave
his Servant there in that Case, and himself,
with the other Servant, essay'd to return to∣ward
<HI>Gearloch</HI> another way, hiring a Guide to
lead him into <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> and from thence was
resolv'd to go to <HI>Gearloch;</HI> but when he came
within Three Miles of the Country of <HI>Loch∣broon</HI>
the Hills there being so high, and the
Snow being so deep, and being fasting watching
and travelling the whole Night before, and
that Day <HI>be fainted,</HI> where he lay Speechless
on the Snow for an Hour and a Half; his
Guide seeing him in that Condition, threatned
to leave him, which he had done, had he not
been forced by his Servant to Attend: After
his reviving he travell'd several Miles, till he
came late that Night to the House of <HI>Ferbquare
Mac Craw,</HI> in <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> where he lodg'd all that
Night, but after Midnight, a Party of eight
or nine Men, well arm'd, broke into the House,
and had taken him away instantly, had not his
Landlord interpos'd for a delay till Day-light,
which when it appear'd they compell'd him
back again to <HI>Kinlochow,</HI> where, after he comes,
notwithstanding all the Fatigue he had met
with that Day, they would not allow him to

the open Fields; in the mean time a new Com∣pany
all in Disguise reliev'd the former Com∣pany,
and brought him back again three Miles
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>
to a Waste-House in a Wood, where they kept
him till Eleven a Clock the next Day being
<HI>Saturday,</HI> but before he left that Place, being
within the Parish of <HI>Gearloch,</HI> he read the Edict
in the Hearing of those who guarded him that
Night.”</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Men that guarded him thus, did not understand
what his Reading was, but said one to another,
Do not believe a Word he says. Thus he
did his Business which he went for as effectu∣ally
as if they had not medled with him; for a
formal reading the Edict within the Paroch,
was all that the Law requir'd.</HEAD>
<P>“The Party being reliev'd by another Party
of Fifteen Men, oblig'd him to travel that Day
thro' Hills and Waters, till he came again
within Four Miles of <HI>Lochbroon,</HI> where the
Company was divided, and Seven of them
convey'd him thro' many deep Waters, some
whereof reached very near his Arm-pits.
Upon the <HI>Saturday</HI> late they brought him to the
remotest Bounds of the Parish of <HI>Contein,</HI> there
they lodg'd with him all Night, he proposed to
some of the People of that Country to preach
to them, the next Day being the Sabbath, and
the People shew'd their willingness to hear him,
but he was no sooner up in the Morning, than
they drag'd him away forward, and told him
that they were under command not to part
with him, till they brought him to, <HI>Fruls;</HI>
that when they came within sight of <HI>Contein,</HI>
they left him, one of them at their departure
drawing him aside, said, He ought not to be
angry at them for his Treatment, seeing they
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
did nothing but what they were commanded to
do by Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> their Master,
whom they could not disobey; and likewise
told him, that it would be in vain for him, or
any other Presbyterian Minister, to attempt the
going to <HI>Gearloch,</HI> for Sir <HI>John</HI> had guarded all
passes to that Country. Mr. <HI>Chrosholm</HI> that Af∣ternoon
went forward to the Ferry-Town of
<HI>Brahan,</HI> where he refreshed himself with some
Meat and Drink, about Seven of the Clock in
the Afternoon, upon the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> being
kept from eating any Food by the several
Companies that guarded him from <HI>Friday</HI>'s
Morning till then; and his Legs and Thighs
were so cut with the Snow and Ice, (being ob∣lig'd
to Travel in a Belted Plaid) that for seve∣ral

<OPENER>Sheweth;</OPENER>
<P>“THat whereas your Petitioner having
preach'd Four Sabbaths in <HI>July</HI> last, in
the Paroch of <HI>Gearloch,</HI> the People of that Pa∣roch,
with the residenting Heritors and <HI>Tutors</HI>
of <HI>Gearloch</HI> testified their Satisfaction with my
Ministry, not only by their numerous At∣tendance
upon my Sermon, and bringing their
Children to be Baptized, and others of them
being Married by me, but also by proceeding
thereafter Voluntarily to give me a Call from
the Paroch of <HI>Boleskine,</HI> where I was Minister, to
be their Minister: Which Call, subscrib'd by
all the Residenting Heritors, and several of
the Inhabitants that could write, was sustained
by the united Presbytries of <HI>Dingwall</HI> and
<HI>Chenerie,</HI> and they with the Presbytries Concur∣rence
did prosecute and obtain (before the Re∣verend
Presbytries of <HI>Inverness</HI>) my Transpor∣tation
from <HI>Boleskine</HI> to <HI>Gearloch:</HI> Upon which,
and an Edict return'd, I was (upon the first of
<HI>March</HI> last) admitted Minister of <HI>Gearloch</HI> at
<HI>Kirseamkirk;</HI> this was done there in regard the
Kirk of <HI>Gearloch</HI> is Sixty Miles distant from
the Dwellings of some of the Ministers in
that Presbytry, whereof there is a wild Desert
eighteen Miles long, without any Inhabitant,
and being then cover'd with Snow, and that
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>
their Number was few, and some of them Volitu∣dinary;
the Paroch of <HI>Gearloch</HI> being present
there by their Commissioner.</P>
<P>“<HI>Thereafter</HI> your Petitioner being for some time
necessarily detained thorow Sickness from my
Paroch, upon the Second Day of <HI>April</HI> current,
having recover'd something of my Health, I
went forward to <HI>Gearloch,</HI> and having come, after
two Days Journey, to <HI>Kenlochow,</HI> in the Confines
of the Paroch, I was intercepted by a Party of
ten Men, all Tenants to Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie,
of Coul;</HI> the Ringleaders whereof <HI>John Kemp</HI>
in <HI>Kenlochow, Keneith Mac-Kenzie,</HI> Weaver, and
<HI>Donald Mac-Forquair,</HI> alias <HI>Mac-Leran,</HI> Shoe∣maker,
there, who declared plainly, they
had their Warrand from <HI>Rorie Mac-Kenzie,
alias Mac-Keneith</HI> and <HI>Rorie Mac-Kechin,</HI> Tax∣man
to the said Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie;</HI> in that
Place the said Party laid violent Hands on me
and my Servant, Rent my Cloaths, made Pri∣soners
of us, and kept us three Days, un∣der
Guard, in a Cottage full of Cattle and
their Dung, without Meat or Bedding; the first
two Days they relieving one another by turns
once every Day by a fresh supply of Men, all
being Tenants to the said Sir <HI>John,</HI> declaring
with Grief, that they were forc'd by the said
<HI>Rorie Mac Kenzie</HI> to use this Barbarity; and
that it was most lamentable to them to be so
employ'd. During my said Imprisonment, the
said <HI>Rorie Mac-Kenzie</HI> deny'd to commune with
me, tho, at sometimes, we were within distance
of speaking one to another, and that I saw him,
and cry'd to him, so as he did hear me, but by
Messages I entreated him for Liberty, to return
the Way I came, or to go forward to my Kirk,
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
or, if they kept me, to allow me a clean House
Maintenance and Bedding during my Impri∣sonment;
all which was refused me, and I was
detain'd as abovesaid till <HI>Sabbath</HI> Morning, at
which time a new Party of <HI>Gerlach</HI>'s Tenants
(who is Minor) the Ringleaders whereof were
<HI>Murchou Mac-Virchivicecbin,</HI> alias <HI>Mac-Kenzie,
Murchou Mac-Millmoir</HI> came armed, and by Vio∣lence
pressed me and my Man out of that
Place the said Morning, obliging us to travel
a long Journey that Day, and left me <HI>Monday</HI>
Morning within two Miles of the abovemen∣tion'd
Sir <HI>John</HI>'s House, and carried away my
Man, whither I could know, declaring when
they came, that they had Orders from <HI>John
Mac-Kenzie, Brother Germane</HI> to the late <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
so to Treat me: All the Persons in either of
these Parties made a secret Regret to me, declar∣ing
they were forc'd to this barbarous Treat∣ment
by the Menaces of Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI>
of <HI>Coul, Collin Mac Kenzie,</HI> Tutor of <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
and the aforesaid <HI>John Mac-Kenzie,</HI> who they
said threatned all the Paroch, if they shewed
any Kindness to me, or any Presbyterian Mini∣ster
in their Bounds, or did not to them all the
Harm in their Power: And the said Parties
bewailed, and declared the Universal Concern
of the Paroch for their Desolations there two
Years by past, being thirty Miles distant from
any Minister; to that their Children were dy∣ing
without Baptism, and they oblig'd to travel
to the Hazard of their Lives for the Benefit of
Marriage; and expressed their Regret, that
they were not allow'd to enjoy me, or the
Benefit of my Ministry, after all their Expecta∣tions
and Desires after me, that it was given
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
out amongst them, That Presbytery way a <HI>Dy∣ing
Cause,</HI> and that there was encouragement
to expect their Curats restored, and therefore
they would keep their Vacancies unsettled, and
laboured to keep me out, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> settled by the
Preshytery. Upon <HI>Monday</HI>'s Morning I used
some Endeavours to be allow'd, to see and con∣verse
with Sir <HI>John Mac-Kenzie</HI> of <HI>Coul,</HI> by
writing to him thereanent; and upon <HI>Tuesday</HI>
thereafter I met with him, and gave him an
Account of my Treatment among his Tenants;
I told him they declared they had his Orders
for what they did; and ask'd if he would own
the same, or if he disown'd it, would give me
his safe Conduct to my Paroch, whereby I
might peaceably exercise my Ministry amongst
my Flock? To which he answer'd, That he was
not oblig'd to own any such Orders, but plain∣ly
own'd, that where-ever he had Power he
would hinder the Settled Minister of <HI>Gerloch,</HI>
and how could I be stopp'd from Officiating
amongst my People considering the Civil Esta∣blishment
of the Goverment of this Church?
To which he answer'd, That it would be the
Queen's Forces after Application to <HI>British</HI>
Parliament, that would give me footing or any
Presbterian Minister in that Place, or in any
other Paroch were he had Interest or Influence,
and that he would not own the Authority of
the Presbytery that admitted me; and thus he
behaved himself, tho' one of the Justices of the
Peace for the County, and an Heritor in the
Paroch of <HI>Gerloch.</HI>”</P>

<P>There is no Argument like that demonstra∣tion

<P>The General Assembly met at <HI>Edinburgh,
May</HI> 10. 1711. The Marquis of <HI>Armandale</HI>
was Her Majesty's Commissioner, who, making
his Speech to the Assembly, presented Her Ma∣jesty's
Letter, wherein Her Majesty assuring
the Assembly of Her Favour and Protection
to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Her Royal
Resolution to Maintain them in all their just
Priviledges; proceeds to recommend several
Things to them, and particularly, <HI>The plan∣ting
vacant Churches with Learned, Diligent,
and Pious Ministers. Note,</HI> These are the
very Words of the Queen's Letter. Little
did Her Majesty know, I dare say, or believe
what Treatment the <HI>Church</HI> had met with in
their Endeavours to plant the said Parishes
as above.</P>
<P>On the 13th the Two Papers above were
Read, by Order of the Assembly, in the
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>
Hearing of the Queen's Commissioner, who,
in Return, made a Speech from the Throne,
expressing his <HI>great surprize at the Occasion,
and his particular Dissatisfaction at such Bar∣barous
and Inhuman Usage, giving the As∣sembly
assurance, that both the Case should be
directly, and fully laid before Her Majesty, in
order to punish the Authors thereof with the
utmost severity, and for preventing the like
for the Future.</HI> These were the very Words.
Nor was the said Commissioner worse than
his Word; and the Consequence was visible,
for Process being order'd in the <HI>Criminal-Courts</HI> against the Persons guilty of another
Riot of the like Kind, they submitted to the
<HI>Curch-Judicatories,</HI> and finding the promis'd
Encouragement from <HI>England</HI> fail'd them,
they humbled themselves as Low as they had
before carry'd themselves High and Furious,
And because the Case is so notorious I shall
end this Chapter with it, as a sufficient Tes∣timony
of the Behaviour of those People to
the Establish'd <HI>Church;</HI> and of the Motives
which have encourag'd them to it; and above
all, a Discovery of the Force put upon the
poor People, who are brought into these
Things both against Inclination and against
Conscience only, not daring to Displease
their Superiors, whose absolute Dominion
over them, is the true and only Cause of
their being concern'd in these Things.</P>

all Fear of God, and Regard to our Laws, are guilty Actors
art and part of the foresaid Crimes, or of one or other of

vacant by the Death of Mr. <HI>George Keith</HI> the for∣mer
Incumbent, Who departed this Life vpon the 16th Day
of <HI>July</HI> last by past, the said Mr. <HI>John Kieth,</HI> sometime a
Minister, now deposed, does intrude in the said Church,
without any Order of Law, and Preaches and Exercises
other parts of the Ministry in that Paroch: And albeit the

Death, did both by Word and Writ, apply to, and
earnestly deal with the <HI>Heritors,</HI> to give them ready and
peaceable Access to the Church; yet the Church-Doors
were shut against them, and those sent by them to Preach
there, were deny'd Access to the Church, and forc'd to
Preach in a Meeting-House: And the <HI>Presbytery</HI> being de∣sirous
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
to have the said Parish settled in the Ordinary man∣ner,
and finding that they could not get Access to the
Church by their Entreaties, they were necessitated, in <HI>Octob.</HI>

Doors made Patent to them, as the Law directs; and the
said Justices did enact, That in Case the Paroch of <HI>Old-Deer</HI> did not give a legal Call, and make Patent Doors to

would order their Constables to make them Patent: And
failing this, That they would, at their next Quarterly-Meeting, to be held at <HI>Old-Deer</HI> the 6th Day of <HI>March,</HI> or∣der

again apply'd to the said Justices of the Peace, for
the End aforesaid, the <HI>Heritors</HI> above-nam'd, who oppos'd
the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> did desire that the settling of a Minister
in the said Paroch, might be delay'd till the next Synod
in <HI>April;</HI> and the <HI>Presbytery</HI> were so desirous of Peace,
that they acquiesced to it, providing the Keys of the Kirk-Doors
were presently deliver'd up, and they allow'd peace∣able
Access to the said Church, that they might thereby
be put in Case in the usual Manner to promote a Parochial
legal Call, but the <HI>Heritors</HI> having refus'd this, the Justi∣ces
of the Peace did appoint any one or two of their Num∣ber
residing within the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> of <HI>Deer</HI> or <HI>Ellen,</HI> to
make open the Doors conform to Law: The <HI>Presbytery</HI>
being by this Refusal and Opposition of the <HI>Heritors</HI> de∣barred
from all Access to promote a Legal Parochial Call;
and the Time allow'd by Law for such a Call being long
elapsed, and thereby the Right of Planting being devolv'd
in the <HI>Presbytery</HI>'s Hand, they did resolve to proceed to the
Settlement of a Minister therein; and having the Request
and Concourse of a great Number of the <HI>Heritors</HI> for Mr.
<HI>John Gordon,</HI> Probationer, Son to <HI>John Gordon,</HI> late Pro∣vost
of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> they proceeded to settle him in the said
Paroch; and to that purpose, having sent Mr. <HI>Thomas Gor∣don,</HI>
Minister at <HI>Loan-May,</HI> upon <HI>Sunday</HI> the 11th Day of
<HI>March</HI> last, to serve his Edict; several of the foresaid Per∣sons,

and others, having posted themselves at the <HI>Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k stile</HI> in
Arms, did violent Oppose the said Mr. <HI>Thomas Gordon,</HI> by
Threatning to beat out his Brains, and holding a great
Batton over his Head, and Swearing he would beat him
down, if he would not presently be gone: And thereby the
said Mr. <HI>Thomas Gordon</HI> being forc'd to retire, the said
<HI>Charles</HI> and his Accomplices did pursue the said Mr. <HI>Tho.
Gordon,</HI> throwing Stones at him, to the endangering of his

Life, and abus'd and bedawb'd him with Mire and Dirt:
And such was their Malice, not only against the <HI>Presby∣tery</HI>
and those sent by them to Preach at that Paroch, but
even against private Christians who came to have the Be∣nefit
of the Ordinances, that they assaulted a Gentlewo∣man
call'd <HI>Elizabeth Thompson,</HI> Neice to <HI>Port-Letham,</HI>
who came to hear a Sermon, and threw her into the Wa∣ter
of <HI>Ugie,</HI> and kept her under Water until she was almost
drowned; and took her Bible from her, and TORE IT:
And this they did from a Design, no doubt, to discourage
People to own the Establish'd Church.”</P>
<P>“And upon the 21st of <HI>March,</HI> the Day before the intend∣ed
Ordination, when Mr. <HI>John Gordon</HI> and two or three

or one or other of the Rabble, came out and met them
with Scare-crows in their Hands, wherewith they made a
hideous Noise, and scared and frighted the Horses upon
which they Rode, to the endangering of the Riders Lives.
And Mr. <HI>John Gordon</HI> having gone in privately by the
back of the Town, and the rest going on in the High-Way
that enters the Town, they were attack'd there by another
Company of the Persons above complain'd upon, both Men

Plough Spades, and were beat and wounded most severely
by the said <HI>George Keith, William Sherril,</HI> or one or other
of the foresaios persons so that with much difficulty they
escap'd to <HI>John Riccart</HI>'s House.</P>
<P>“And upon the 22d of <HI>Merch,</HI> being the Day prefix'd for

Kirktoun of Old <HI>Deer,</HI> they found the Persons abovenam'd,
with a Multitude of others couveen'd together in a tumul∣tuary
manner, and arm'd some with GUNS, others with
Swords, Corn-Forks, Durks, Bow-Cutts, and other offen∣sive
Instruments: And the said Presbytery having enter'd
the House of <HI>James Bruce in Old Deer;</HI> and having con∣stitute
their Meeting, they apply'd to <HI>James Keith,</HI> younger,
of <HI>Keithfield,</HI> Justice of Peace, requiring him, in obedience
to Law, and to the above-mentioned Appointment of the
Quarter-Session, to make open the Doors of the Church,
that they might have Access to perform the Ordination;
and <HI>Alexander Thompson</HI> of <HI>Port-Letham,</HI> another Justice
of Peace, being present, <HI>Keithfield</HI> requir'd his Concur∣rence;
and the said Justices requir'd the Keys of the
Kirk-Doors from the Bedel, under Form of Instrument;
and perceiving that the People that were thus conveened
<PB N="185" REF="196"/>
intended to make Opposition, the said Justices of the Peace
requir'd the Assistance of Captain <HI>John Forbes</HI> of <HI>Boyndley,</HI>
the Bailie <HI>Stewart, James Sandilands,</HI> Son to Provost <HI>Sandi∣lands,</HI>
in <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and others that had come to join in
Divine Worship, and to countenance the Ordination; and
then coming out towards the Church-Stile, which was
fast shut and baracadoed by the Rabble, they found a great
Body of the foresaids Rabblers, both Men and Women,
posted without the Kirk-Stile, arm'd as above, and having
several Heaps of Stones gathered beside them; which Bo∣dy
of People stept aside, and gave way to the Justices, Mi∣nister,
and others with them, until they were got in be∣twixt
two Houses joining with their Corners to the two
Sides of the Kirk-Stile, and so soon as the Justices, Mi∣nisters,
and others were entered in betwixt the said two
Houses, the fore-mentioned Body surrounded and inclosed
them; and then another great Body of the Rabble, armed
as above, which was within the Kirk-yard, (the Persons
above complained upon, making a Part of both the said
Bodies) did climb over the Church-yard Dike, and got
upon the Tops of the said two Houses, and being furnish'd
with Stones of great Bigness by their Accomplices, they
threw them down with Violence upon the said Justices,
Presbytery, and others that joined with them, while, in the
mean Time these, from the Church-yard, were throwing
Stones; and the Rabble that had surrounded them behind,
were both throwing Stones and stricking at them with
their Swords, Bow-Cutts, and Butts of their Guns, where∣by
a great many of them were most dangerously hurt and
wounded, particularly the said Laid of <HI>Keithfield,</HI> Justice of
the Peace, was thrown down to the Ground, and was so beat
and wounded by the said <HI>William, Charles,</HI> and <HI>Charles
Gordon,</HI> or one or other of the Persons above-complain'd
upon, or one or other of the said Rabble, that he hardly
escaped with his Life; and the Laird of <HI>Portletham,</HI> the
other Justice of Peace, was beat by 'em; and Mr. <HI>Alexan∣der
Anchinleck,</HI> Minister at <HI>Frazersburgh,</HI> Moderator of the
said Presbytery, was so beat upon the Back with Stones
thrown by one or other of the said Persons complained
upon, or at least by the Rabble which they headed, or at
least did join with them, that he was in great Pain a long
Time afterwards; And the above-mentioned Mr. <HI>Thomas
Gorden</HI> was cut in the forehead to the Skull, and had other
two Wounds in his Head, and two in his Hands; all gi∣ven
by one or other of the foresaid Persons. Mr. <HI>James
Anderson,</HI> Minister at <HI>Rathen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Blackwell,</HI> Mi∣nister
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Duncan,</HI> Preacher of the
Gospel, were also beat and hurt; and <HI>James Sandilands<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Son to Provost <HI>Sandilands</HI> in <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> who was one of
them that were called by the said Justices to their Assist∣ance,
had his Thumb almost cut off by the foresaid <HI>William,
Charles,</HI> or one or other of the Persons above complained
upon, or one or other of the foresaid Rabble; and <HI>James
Deans,</HI> Dean of <HI>Gild</HI> in <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> the said <HI>John Forbes,
Bailie Stewart, Thomas Forbes</HI> in <HI>Ludquhairn, William Fife</HI>
in <HI>Gilkimstoun, Andrew Burnet</HI> of <HI>Elrig, Charles Forbes,</HI>
and <HI>Walter Gordon,</HI> Merchants, <HI>John Duff,</HI> Messenger,
<HI>William Tait</HI> in <HI>Ludquhairn,</HI> and many more, were hurt
and wounded by the said <HI>George Rob,</HI> or one or other of the
Persons complain'd upon, or one or other of the fore∣said
Rabble. The saids Justices of Peace, Ministers,
and others with them, finding themselves thus inclos'd,
and all like to be kill'd, they were oblig'd to force their
Way back again through the Rabble that surrounded them
behind; a Part of which Rabble did pursue them to <HI>John
Riccart's</HI> Closs, some throwing Stones over the Houses
upon them, and others firing Guns after them with such
Fury, that the Colfing, or Forrage, fired the Thatch of <HI>Ric∣cart's</HI>
House; and thereafter the said Rabble went into
the said <HI>John Riccart</HI>'s House, where the Presbytery's
Dinner was provided, and first enquir'd if any of the Mi∣nisters
were there, and threatned, that if any of them, or
these that had joined with them, were found concealed
in the House, they would set Fire to both Ends of it;
and then they seized and did eat up the Victuals, and carried
a Part of the Liquors out to the Mercat-Cross and drunk
it, having a Bag-pips all the while playing to them, and
then went out to meet Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> the Intruder, who was
coming in to <HI>Kirktoun.</HI> The Presbytery being thus hotly
handled, and perceiving that they could not get the Ordi∣nation
performed without the inevitable Hazard of their
Lives, they were necessitate to go Home without finishing
the same. As the manner of acting in this Rabble was
most unaccountable, so the same did not happen by meer
Accident, but was contrived aforehand, and the Measures
laid down by the saids <HI>William Baird</HI> of <HI>Auchmedden, James
Keith,</HI> of <HI>Creiche,</HI> or one or other of them: In so far as,
1<HI>mo.</HI> They or some of them kept a Meeting at <HI>Old Deer,</HI>
about the 9th or 10th of <HI>March</HI> last, or one or other of the
Days of the said Month, wherein they concerted the fore∣said
Opposition. 2<HI>do.</HI> They contrived and caused publish
Thro' the Paroch a false and seditious Paper, wherein they
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>
libel and rail against the establish'd Government, Order
and Worship of this Church, on purpose to excite the
People against the Presbytery, and pretending that they
could not in Conscience joyn therewith. They declare
their intended Opposition to the Settlement of the Paroch
with a Presbyterian Minister; and they contrived and
drew up another Paper, which they caused read in the
Church, upon the Lord's Day, immediately before the said
Rabble, Warning and Enjoining the Parochioners to meet
together at the Day appointed for ths Ordination, in or∣der
to oppose the same. 3^<HI>t<SUP>io</SUP>.</HI> They ordered several Per∣sons,
some Days before the appointed Diet of Ordination,
to Warn and Enjoin the People to conveen the foresaid
Day for the said End, and sent some to <HI>Lennaboes</HI> Mercat,
to stir up the People there conveen'd for the same Purpose;
and the said Gentlemen, or one or other of them, did en∣courage
the Rabble, by promising to free them of all Char∣ges
and Expences, and to protect them from any Punish∣ment
that should be inflicted on them, upon account of
their Accession to the said Tumult. And albeit the said
<HI>William Baird,</HI> of <HI>Auchmedden,</HI> was petitioned, pulickly,
when sitting in his own Baron Court, by <HI>Anna Greden,</HI>
Spouse to <HI>John Turner,</HI> Clerk, in <HI>Old D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> representing,
That her House was molested and damnified by some of his
Men or Tenents, who threatned her for harbouring of Mr.
<HI>John Gordon,</HI> and entreating the said Rabble might be Dis∣courag'd;
yet he not only refused to grant her Request,
but mocked and ridiculed her, even in the Court-place,
and before a great many of the Persons guilty, who were
there present: Yea, there were of his own Domestick Ser∣vants
present at the said Rabble, and very active therein:
And the said <HI>Silvester Dauglass, George Rankin,</HI> and <HI>Charles
Morison,</HI> gave Orders to some of the said Rabble, That they
should stand their Ground against all the Persons that
should be there, seeing there were no Soldiers in the Coun∣try
to oppose them.</P>
<P>“And the said <HI>Charles Morison</HI> came armed to <HI>Old Deer</HI>
the same Day that the Rabble happen'd; and tho' he was
desir'd by the Justices of Peace to assist them in making
Patent Doors, yet he did it not: And the said <HI>John Forbes</HI>
not only came there armed the same Day, but brought
with him several of the People of <HI>Pitfour</HI>'s Ground, and
even of his own Domestick Servants, and order'd them
to assist in the Rabble; And the saids <HI>Creichie, Bruxie</HI>
and <HI>Auchrenny</HI> did give out, that by a late Act of the
<HI>British</HI> Parliament PATRONAGES were restored, and
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
protested for the Benefit of that Act, and that the Pres∣bytery
should not presume to go on in their Intention of
planting their Church, and threatned them, that if they
went on with it, they might expect to be rabbled: And
this they also exprest in the Reasons of Appeal given in
to the Presbytery by them, for themselves, and in name of
some others of the <HI>Heritors,</HI> or at least by <HI>William Bow∣man,</HI>
Indweller in <HI>Deer,</HI> their Commissioner, whereof an
authentick Copy is in the Hands of the Clerk of Justi∣ciary,
and the Mandate by the said <HI>Bowman</HI>'s Constituents
is in the Hands of one or other of the Defenders them∣selves,
or in the Hands of one or other of the Witnesses,
subjoin'd in the List to the Libel: At least the said Man∣date,
signed by all or one or other of the said Defenders,
was seen and read, and the subscriptions known by the
Witnesses subjoin'd to the Libel, or a sufficient Number
of them, against Mr. <HI>John Gordon</HI>'s Ordination; and the
said Persons, or one or other of them, to animate and en∣courage
such of the People as are disaffected to the Esta∣blished
Church, did also give out, That <HI>Mr. Greenshield</HI>'s
Case being decided in his Favour by the House of Peers,
they might, if they opposed Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> quickly expect an
Episcopal Minister, or some Expression to this purpose:
Thus boasting and abusing the Name of Authority inso∣lently
against the Establish'd Church, in Contempt of the
Laws, and most solemn Treaty of UNION. And sicklike
the said <HI>William, Charles,</HI> elder, and <HI>William</HI> and <HI>John,
Charles</HI>'s two Sons, with a great many others of the
Persons above complained upon, or at least one or other
of them armed as above, did, upon the said 22d Day of
<HI>March,</HI> or one or other of the Days of the said Month,
seize upon two Horses belonging to the said <HI>Bailie Stuart,</HI>
loaded with Goods, Wares, Furniture or Provision, of a
very considerable Value of about 40 lib. Sterling Money,
coming towards the <HI>Kirktoun</HI> of <HI>Old Deer,</HI> and did violently
seize the same; and having abused and maltreated the
two Men that had the Charge thereof, they carry'd the
same off by Force, and did dispose thereupon as they
thought fit; excepting only two Trunks belonging to the
said <HI>Robert Stuart,</HI> whilk they thought fit, at their Season,
to send back; And for doing this they pretended the
Laird of <HI>Auchmedden</HI>'s Order. And the said Mr. <HI>John
Keith</HI> having been deposed by the Sentence of the said
Presbytery of <HI>Deer,</HI> and never having any legal Call by
the People, nor lawful Admission to be Minister of the said
Paroch of <HI>Old Deer,</HI> does, contrary to all Law and Order,
<PB N="189" REF="200"/>
possess the said Church, Preaches and exercises other Parts
of the Ministerial Function within the said Paroch; and
the said Mr. <HI>John Keith</HI> dad so far encourage the said
Rabble, that after he returned from <HI>Duggat</HI>
of <HI>Bis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,</HI> a profess'd <HI>Papist</HI>'s House, (whither he had retir'd
during the Heat of the Action) he very kindly saluted the
Actors, and gave them his hearty Thanks for their good
Behaviour, and went that Evening to the said <HI>John Ric∣cart</HI>'s
House, where a part or the said Rabblers were
assembled Eating, and Drinking, and rejoycing for their
Victory, and continued there among them; and at length
they came to that pitch of Drunkenness, that they fell a
struggling among themselves, and threw one another in
the Fire in his Presence: Likeas, the said <HI>William Baird</HI>

<HEAD>The Terms of Accommodation between the Heritors of the Pa∣roch
of Old-Deer, and the Presbytery of the Bounds,
Are as follows, viz.</HEAD>
<Q><P><HI>First,“</HI> The <HI>HERITORS</HI> have engaged to give all due
and suitable Encouragement to Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> the Pres∣terian
Minister, whom they Rabbl'd and Oppos'd; and
to give him the peaceable Possession of the <HI>Kirk-Manse,
Glebe</HI> and <HI>Stipend,</HI> and to defend and maintain him in
the same,” during his Incumbency.</P>
<P>2.“ They have engaged to refund the Charges and Expen∣ces
the Presbytery have been at; and the <HI>HERITORS</HI>
have engaged to cause Four of the principal Rabblers to
appear before the Congregation of <HI>Old-Deer,</HI> there to
be publickly Rebuked, (that is to say, to be set on
the Stool of Repentance.”)</P>
<P>3.“ To cause all the Rabblers, contained in the principal
Letters, (<HI>i. e.</HI> Indictment) to subscribe a Paper wherein
they acknowledge their Sin before God, and the Offence
given to the Presbytery; and promise and engage in
Time coming, to behave and act as it becomes good
Christians and Subjects, and not to molest or insult any
of the Ministers; and this under the Penalties of a
Thousand Marks, <HI>Scots,</HI> and this Paper to be read thro'
all the Churches of the Presbytry; on which Terms all
Proceedings were to be discharged.”</P></Q>
<P>Thus the Presbytery has full Satisfaction
for the Insult offer'd them; and one would
think this might be full Satisfaction to any
body in the World, that the Fact was true,
and that there was such a Rabble at <HI>Old-Deer.</HI>
If any Man shall doubt it after this,
I cannot think that such a Man is fit for any
Body to take Notice of.</P>
<P>After this one would think there needed
no more to be said to clear up, or expose ei∣ther
the Conduct of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters,</HI> or the Re∣turns
of the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> to them.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="203"/>
But there seems yet a Necessity to bring
another Scheme upon the Stage, in Order
to introduce the Affair of <HI>Toleration,</HI> since
unhappily Establish'd there by Parliament,
and this is a Case no less publick than the
<HI>Toleration</HI> itself, <HI>viz.</HI> The Case of <HI>Green∣shields,</HI>
and of his Setting up the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI>
in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> of which much
Noise has been made, and which has been
represented in so many several Ways to the
World, that it requires some Difficulty to
give a True and Impartial Account of it,
which, nevertheless, I shall endeavour to
do as briefly and as authentickly as possible.</P>
<P>Whether the Employing this Man to
make the Attempt in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and in the
Face of the Magistrates, was a Design of the
<HI>Episcopal Party</HI> to make an Experiment up∣on
the People of that City or no; or whe∣ther
it was a meer Undertaking of the Man
for a Livelyhood, upon the Encouragement
of the <HI>Englishmen</HI> in the several Offices of
the <HI>Customs, Excise, Exchequer,</HI> &amp;c. as he
pretended, I shall not dispute here.</P>
<P>But that it was an Attempt Illegal in its
Circumstances, and particularly manag'd to
insult the Magistrates, and try the Extent
of their Authority, remains no more a
Doubt, as by the Historical Part in the en∣suing
Chapter shall appear.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Attempt of setting up
the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> in <HI>Edin.</HI>
had not made such a Noise,
as it did at this time, if the
Manner of doing it had not
satisfy'd the People there,
that it was not the saying the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI>
or reading the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which was the De∣sign,
but the affronting the Magistrates; fly∣ing
in the Face of the Laws, and insulting the
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>
Government, as well Ecclesiastick as Civil;
for the <HI>Liturgy</HI> was read in Two several
Meeting-Houses in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> before, and
the Ministers reading it met with no Distur∣bance
at all; but this not satisfying, it was
manag'd now in such a Manner, as that the
Magistrates must take Cognizance of it, or
no longer pretend to the Legal Power of
Magistrates in that City.</P>
<P>The first Step taken in this Affair, was to
cause a Rumour to be spread Abroad, That
Her Majesty had given the <HI>Old-Kirk</HI> at <HI>Haly-Rood-House,</HI>
being the <HI>Chappel-Royal</HI> belong∣ing
to the Queen's Palace, to the <HI>Episcopal</HI>
People to turn into a Chappel for the Use of
the <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen who belong'd to the
several Offices of the <HI>Customs, Excise, Exche∣quer,
Army,</HI> or <HI>Navy,</HI> which were or should
Occasionally be there, to have the <HI>English</HI>
Service read therein, and to have the Mi∣nister
preach in a Gown, and read Prayers
in a Surplice, as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Account of this gave no great Un∣easiness,
because the People had quickly an
Assurance, even from the Queen Herself,
that no <HI>Innovation</HI> should be encourag'd,
and that no such Grant was, or should be,
obtain'd for the said Chappel.</P>
<P>But a Plot being ripe, a Tool was not
long wanting; one <HI>Greenshields,</HI> a poor and
contemptible Fellow, a <HI>Scots</HI> Man by Birth,
but lately come from <HI>Ireland,</HI> was found, or,
<PB N="195" REF="206"/>
as some say, brought over as a fit Instrument
for this Work. The Character of this Fel∣low
is very brief: He was the Son of a Be∣dell,
or Precentor, or Clark, near about, or
in <HI>Lithgo;</HI> his Reputation, as to publick
Scandal, was charg'd with open Drunken∣ness,
lewd Behaviour, Singing Beastly Songs,
and the like; his Assurance was unquesti∣on'd;
he had taken the Oaths to the Queen;
was very meanly Taught; had little Cler∣gy;
mean Parts; and was a most wretched
Preacher: But all these Defects were sup∣ply'd
in Face, and he never wanted to put
himself up at a good Price.</P>
<P>This Instrument being obtain'd, the next
Thing was to put it into a Method; for
this Reason, and to put the same Face on it
that was pretended before, the Thing was
propos'd to some <HI>English</HI> Men in the Office of
the <HI>Customs,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer,</HI> who willingly
(tho' weakly) came into the Snare, and agreed
to subscribe him 80<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to read the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Liturgy to them, preach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the
Subscription for this was actually begun.</P>
<P>Upon this, about <HI>July,</HI> 1709, he began,
and having taken a House in the most pub∣lick
Part of the City, he open'd his Meeting
just at the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which is the
Parade or Exchange of all the People of any
Business or Fashion, and especially where,
on every <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the Magistrates go in
their Formalities to the Great Church.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="207"/>
Two Things in this Attempt alarm'd the
People; 1. Its being done so in the Face of
the Government, and in Contempt of the
Magistrates, or, indeed, of the Laws: And,
2. That it was pretended to be own'd by
the <HI>English</HI> Men, who being newly United,
and having Places and Sallaries there from
the State, were, as it may be said, Eating the
Nation's Bread; and in whom, therefore, the
Insolence was very Affronting; and the more
in, that it was at a Time when Her Majesty
was Daily Assuring the People She would
never encourage any <HI>Invasion</HI> of their Pri∣vileges,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these Considerations the Mobb were
very hardly restrain'd from Falling upon them
with Violence, and the following Step was
rather encourag'd to put a Stop to, and pre∣vent
the common People's Fury, than from
any other Reason. The Commission of the
General Assembly happen'd to be Sitting just
at that Time, to whom the Citizens of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> apply'd, in a Petition to them, to
take Cognizance of this Attempt, as an <HI>In∣vation</HI>
in their Worship, and an <HI>In∣novasion</HI>
on the Privileges of the <HI>Church of Scotland,</HI>
and that they would immediately silence
and put a Stop to the same; such was the
Zeal of the Inhabitants, that, in less than
Two Hours, they got several Hundred
Hands to this Petition.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Petition, the Commission
<PB N="197" REF="208"/>
referr'd the Matter to the <HI>Presbytry, as you
will see at large afterward;</HI> and accordingly
the <HI>Presbytry</HI> cited him before them, where
he appear'd, but with great Haughtiness, dis∣owning
their Authority, and refusing to give
any Account of himself. The History of his
Behaviour, and their Treating him there
is publick, already, in many particular
Tracts, and needs not to take up any Room
in this Tract: Only, that future Ages may
have a right Notion of that Affair, it is ne∣cessary
to observe some few of the most ma∣terial
Passages that relate to it, more parti∣cularly,
that the <HI>Presbytry</HI> enquir'd nothing
of, nor pass'd any Censure about his Setting
up a New Worship in <HI>Scotland,</HI> viz. Reading
the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, or Common-Prayer,
nor of his Pinciples, as being <HI>Episcopal,</HI> but
ask'd him, particularly, <HI>By what Authority
he exercis'd the Office of a Minister in that
Place?</HI> He refus'd to answer for some Time,
but at length told them, <HI>He was an Ordain'd
Minister.</HI> They ask'd him, <HI>What Minister?</HI>
He answer'd, <HI>A Minister of the Church of</HI>
England. Being requir'd to produce his Let∣ters
of <HI>Ordination,</HI> he declin'd that also for
some Time, but, at last, produc'd Orders grant∣ed
by a <HI>Scots</HI> Depos'd, Exauctorate Bishop.</P>
<P>Upon this, the <HI>Moderator</HI> of the <HI>Presbytry,</HI>
or one of the Members, ask'd him how he
could have the Face to say to them before,
<HI>That he was a Minister of the Church of</HI> Eng∣land?
<PB N="198" REF="209"/>
To which he gave this absurd Reply,
viz. <HI>That the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and the
Episcopal Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>were Encorpo∣rated
by the Union.</HI> But the Emptiness of
this Shift being soon Expos'd, and he Obli∣ged
not to Insist upon it, he was told, his
Orders were insufficient; and the said Bi∣shop's
being totally Deprived by the Laws
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Exauctorate and Disabled, they
had no more power to Authorize any Man
to Preach, or admit any Man into Orders,
in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and therefore,
tho' he might esteem himself a Minister on
that account, they could not allow him to
be such; nor had he any Legal Authority
to Exercise the Office of a Minister, within
the Bounds of that Church. What Law
they grounded this upon, and that it was
really agreeable to an express Act of Par∣liament,
we shall see by and by in the De∣fence
made to it by the Magistrates of <HI>Edinb.</HI></P>
<P>He insisted upon his Orders; and Dis∣owning
their Authority, went out of the
Court abruptly, refusing to Answer to any
Thing they should Object. Whereupon the
<HI>Presbytry,</HI> Thinking it their Duty to main∣tain
the <HI>Legal Authority</HI> of a Church Judi∣catory,
which they were fully vested with
by the Laws of the Land, thought fit to pass
their Sentence, which they drew up in Form,
and he refusing to obey their Summons, or ap∣pear
when cited, they caus'd their said Sen∣tence
<PB N="199" REF="210"/>
to be signify'd to him, and Copies left
at his Lodgings by the proper Officer, as the
Law directs.</P>
<P>I noted before, that the Commission of the
Assembly was then sitting, and it should be
observ'd, That they enter'd the more will∣ingly
into this Examination, to prevent the
Fury and Mischief of a Rabble, which they
foresaw would be the Event, the People be∣ing
enraged, to the last Degree, at the Inso∣lence
of this <HI>Greenshields,</HI> and his Behaviour,
which was particularly provoking; also, as
I noted, it was at the Request, and upon the
Address, or Petition of the Inhabitants of
<HI>Edinburgh:</HI> The Copy of which I think it is
very proper to give at large, and is as follows:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Ʋnto the very Reverend and Honoura∣ble
the Commission of the late General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">We the Neighbourhood of the Town of Edinburgh and
Suburbs underscrib'd, do most humbly represent,</HEAD>
<P>“THAT notwithstanding the many good
Laws and Acts of Parliament, and
particularly the Act 6 and 7 Parliaments,
1707. made for the Settlement and Secu∣rity
of this National Church, and against
all Encroachments upon Her Right, or
Privileges, or Innovations in her Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline, or Government; and
<PB N="200" REF="211"/>
of Her Majesty's repeated Assurances in
Her Royal Proclamations, Letters to Her
Privy-Council, and the General Assemblies
of this Church, to maintain and defend
the same in its present Establishments,
against all such unlawful Intrusions, In∣croachments,
and Innovations, particularly
Her Majesty's Proclamation against un∣lawful
Intruders into Churches and Man∣ses
in <HI>Scotland”</HI> dated <HI>Septemb.</HI> 20. 1708.</P>
<P>“Yet, to our very great Surprize, several
of the <HI>Episcopal Clergy</HI> (prompted and in∣stigate
thereunto by the <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI>
who are equally disaffected to the Civil as
to our Ecclesiastick Constitution) have of
late not only Erected Meeting-Houses in
this City, after the <HI>Scots</HI> Episcopal Way,
but also in several Places here have set up
the <HI>English</HI> Service, which, as it is contrary
to our Establishment, and very grievous
and offenfive to us and all others, who are
well-affected to Her Majesty and the pre∣sent
Establishment, so it will be of fatal
and dangerous Consequence to this <HI>Church,</HI>
if not speedily remedy'd.”</P>
<P>“It would be consider'd in the <HI>First</HI> Place,
That several of such as preach in these
Meeting-Houses are known to be, not on∣ly
unfound in their Judgments, but also
scandalous and immoral in their Lives
and Practices; and however they may
pretend to be qualify'd according to Law,
<PB N="201" REF="212"/>
yet, if they were not Secret, and Heart-Enemies
to Her Majesty and the present
Government, they would never yield
themselves Tools to a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, for
carrying on of their wicked and pernici∣ous
Designs.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Secondly,</HI> They cannot pretend it to be
Matter of Conscience, in setting up of the
<HI>English</HI> Service here, for abstracting from
<HI>Presbyterians,</HI> even the Body and Bulk of
the Episcopal Perswasion in <HI>Scotland</HI> have
never been fond of the <HI>English</HI> Way of
Worship; but, upon many Occasions, have
testify'd their Dislike of the same, and none
of them scruple to joyn in Communion
with this <HI>Church,</HI> but such as are either
openly Profane, and will not subject to
<HI>Church-Discipline,</HI> or avow'd <HI>Jacobites.</HI>
And therefore,”</P>
<P>“<HI>Thirdly,</HI> We conceive, That by these il∣legal
and unwarrantable Encroachments,
Intrusions, and Innovations, they design
no less than the Ruin of both <HI>Church</HI> and
<HI>State;</HI> for as the setting up of the <HI>English</HI>
Service here did in former Times breed
much Trouble and Confusion in this
<HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Nations,</HI> so at present it does
raise and foment Jealousies and Heart-burn∣ings
in the Minds of People, otherwise
zealously affected to Her Majesty's Person
and Government, and exceedingly widens
the Breach betwixt us and the separating
<PB N="202" REF="213"/>
Parties on both Hands: And the Instiga∣tors
to, and Abettors of these Practices are
in big Hopes, and not without good and
evident Grounds, that this will prove an
effectual Means of Alienating the Hearts
and Affections of many of our QUEEN's
Best and most Loyal Subjects, from Her
Majesty's Person and the present Esta∣blishment;
and that by that Means they
shall effectually wound and weaken the
<HI>Church</HI> on both Sides, and also ruin the
<HI>Civil Government.”</HI></P>
<P>“We must also humbly represent, That
albeit we have many good and laudable
Laws and Acts of Parliament against <HI>Po∣pery</HI>
and <HI>Papists,</HI> their Trafficking and
Practising in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly against
their Teaching of any Science, Art and
Exercise within the same, and against all
Irreligion and Blasphemies; yet <HI>Papists</HI>
do openly and avowedly teach and practice,
even within the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and
Suburbs. And now, also a profane and
deluded Crew of <HI>Enthusiasts</HI> are set up in
this Place, who, under Pretence to the
Spirit of Prophecy, do utter most horrid
Blasphemies against the ever Glorious Tri∣nity,
such as ought not to be suffer'd in
any <HI>Christian Church</HI> or <HI>Nation,</HI> seeing this
strikes at the very Root and Vitals of all
<HI>Religion,</HI> and is set on Foot of <HI>Satan</HI> to
confound (if possible) all solid Thoughts
of a Deity amongst us.”</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="214"/>
“We have, for Brevity's Sake, represented
but a few of the many Inconveniences that
will certainly follow the Sufferings of
such Practices, and do judge it our Duty,
in all Humility, to lay them before the
Reverend Commission, seeing you are set
by the <HI>Church of Scotland</HI> upon the Watch-Tower,
to advert, that the Interest of <HI>Je∣sus Christ,</HI>
and the present Establishment
of this Church, do not suffer, or sustain
any Prejudice which you can prevent,
particularly to take special Care to keep
and maintain Unity in the <HI>Church</HI> upon
all Emergents; and to see to the due
Execution of the Acts of Assemblies, which
are very plain and express against such In∣novations
in the Worship of God, particu∣larly
the Act 15 <HI>Gen. Assembly,</HI> 1707.
And therefore humbly and earnestly beg
and entreat, That, as you tender the <HI>Glory</HI>
of God, the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> of this <HI>Church,</HI>
and the <HI>Quiet</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of Her Majesty's

Endeavours for Suppressing and Crushing
such intolerable and pernicious Practices
and Designs in the Bud—”
<Q>And your Supplicants shall ever pray, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The like Address they presented to the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Humble Representation of the Neigh∣bours

<OPENER>Honourable and Worthy Patriots,</OPENER>
<P>“WHereas our Holy <HI>Protestant</HI> Re∣form'd

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>These Addresses having been Presented,
at the same Time signifie the Earnestness of
the People in the Case.</P>
<P>The Magistrates took no Steps at this
Time, waiting to let the Commission begin
in their usual Method: The Commission
referr'd the Cause to the <HI>Presbytry</HI> of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
and they proceeded as you have heard.</P>
<P>The Commission of the Assembly, indeed,
made an Act, Entituled, <HI>Act of the Commission
of the General Assembly against Innovation in
the Worship of God.</HI> August 5. 1709. This
Act, too long to be incerted here, because
I have other Things to Record, which can∣not
be omitted, was, in short, a Reciting the
several Acts of Parliament, by which the
Privileges of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> were
Secur'd to them; and by which the Purity
and Uniformity of the <HI>Church</HI> were Legally
Confirm'd. And Concludes, with Directing
the several <HI>Presbytries</HI> to put those Laws in
Execution against Innovation of Worship,
and to apply to the Civil Magistrate there∣fore,
as the Law directs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Presbytry</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in pursuance
of this, took the Case in hand, as you have
heard; and having fully heard the Case,
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>
pronounc'd Sentence against him to this
purpose, <HI>viz. That the said</HI> James Green∣shields
<HI>being not legally Ordain'd a Minister,
was not empower'd to execute the Office of a
Minister within the Bounds of this</HI> Presbytry.
The fuller Copy follows in the ensuing Pages
hereof.</P>
<P>This Sentence they sent, in Writing, to
Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> and another Copy thereof
to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> requiring,
or rather requesting the said Magistrates to
cite the said Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> before them,
and order the said Sentence to be enforc'd
by their Authority, according to an act of
Parliament, which requires the Civil Ma∣gistrate
to put in Execution the Sentences
of the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, That the Proceedings of
the Magistrates with this Man, and his Be∣haviour
to them, at his several appearings, is
wholly omitted by the Author of <HI>The Case
of Mr.</HI> Greenshields. Indeed, being a Thing
too Scandalous to be Vindicated, it was most
prudently done to omit it. The Case was,
in short, thus: The Magistrates citing him
before them, acquainted him with the Sen∣tence,
and that they were oblig'd, by Law, to
Cause the same to be executed; and therefore
desired, That he would, <HI>Obtemper,</HI> that is,
give Obedience, or submit to the same, as the
Law directed. This he peremptorily refus'd,
and declar'd, <HI>That he would continue to ex∣ercise
<PB N="208" REF="219"/>
the Office of a Minister, and read the</HI>
English <HI>Liturgy in</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>notwith∣standing
any such Sentences, or any Order
they should make to the Contrary.</HI></P>
<P>The Magistrates however proceeding with
all Mildness and Temper possible, bid him
<HI>Consider of it,</HI> and gave him Time for it till
the next Week.</P>
<P>But the next <HI>Sabbath</HI> he not only Opened
his New Meeting-House, but walked up to
the Cross, where he was sure to meet the
Magistrates at their coming out of the Church,
and standing just in their view, shewed them
all the Disrespect possible, even to an open
Mocking and Reviling them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the said Magistrates
had sent an Impartial Account of all their
Proceedings to the Secretary of State, Re∣presenting,
effectually, the Behaviour of the
Man, the Rights of the Church, and the
express Laws against these Things, and had
receiv'd Letters from his Grace the Duke of
<HI>Queensberry</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Sund—d,</HI> by
Her Majesties special Command, approving
of their Proceedings, and assuring them, That
Her Majesty was resolved to give no Encou∣ragement
to those Innovations; but was re∣solved
to Protect the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in
all their just Privileges, and Encouraging
the Magistrates to put the Laws in Execu∣tion,
which Letters remains still, under the
Hands of the said several Secretaries of State,
<PB N="209" REF="220"/>
in Possession of the Magistrates aforesaid,
the Originals whereof I have seen.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Magistrates, as well enforc'd
for the Justification of their own Authori∣ty,
as by the Directions of the Laws, Ci∣ting
the said <HI>Greenshields</HI> before them again,
and he Contemning their Authority, <HI>as be∣fore,</HI>
they committed him to the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI>
there to remain till he should give Security
to submit to the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>
aforesaid. The Copy of the Magistrates <HI>Com∣mitment,</HI>
Including also the Sentence of the
<HI>Presbytery,</HI> is as follows:</P>

shewing, that where;</P>
<P>At <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the 7th Day of <HI>Sept.</HI> One thousand
seven hundred and nine Years; the <HI>Presbytery</HI> of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> having consider'd a Reference from the
Session of the College Kirk, concerning Mr. <HI>James
Greenshields;</HI> did, thereupon, cite the said Mr. <HI>Green∣shields</HI>
before them, and he compearing, produced
an Act of Ordination by the Exauctorated Bishop
<PB N="210" REF="221"/>
of <HI>Ross;</HI> dated <HI>August,</HI> One thousand six hundred
and ninety four Years; bearing, that he was or∣dain'd
a <HI>Presbyter</HI> according to the Rites and Usa∣ges
of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> together with Testi∣monials
from <HI>Ireland;</HI> was interrogate by what
Authority he did preach, and exercise any Part of
the Ministry within the Bounds of this <HI>Presbytery,</HI>
without Call or Warrand from this <HI>Presbytery</HI> con∣form
to Law; he did decline the Authority of this
<HI>Presbytery</HI> and <HI>Church,</HI> and subscrib'd the same, <HI>coram.</HI>
The Tenour whereof follows; <HI>Whereas, being or∣dain'd
a Minister of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and has
been of that Communion ever since, and now am and
having Occasion to come and to reside in my own Coun∣try;
where, for my Benefit, and the Benefit of those who
were in the same Circumstances with myself, I do, in a
private House, keep Divine Worship, according to the
Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and since by the
Union of the two Kingdoms, I do believe that the Epis∣copal
Church of</HI> Scotland is now incorporate with the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and that though Presbytety is the
legal Establishment of <HI>North-Britain,</HI> yet I find there
is no Law against those of the Communion of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> to exercise their Worship in a private Man∣er,
without intruding into any Church or Glebe of any
Minister establish'd by Law; and, therefore, I do not
think myself subject, or liable to any Censure of any Eccle∣siastical
Judicatory in <HI>North-Britain,</HI> but only in so far
as to give an Account that I am lawfully ordain'd Mi∣nister,
and free of any Scandal that may incapacitate me
for such an Undertaking. And whereupon I take instru∣ments.
Sic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubbitur James Greenshields. Which be∣ing
read, he was remov'd, and being call'd in again,
and the Moderator having told him that he had
declin'd the Authority of this Church. To which
he reply'd, That this Church had no Jurisdiction
<PB N="211" REF="222"/>
over him, as to Spiritual Concerns, and adher'd to
his former Declinature. All which, the <HI>Presbytery</HI>
considering, do find, That the said Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI>
has, in high Contempt of this Church Establish∣ment
by Law, declined their Authority; that he
has exercis'd the Ministry within the Bounds of
this <HI>Presbytery,</HI> without their Allowance, which is
an unwarrantable Intrusion; and introduc'd a Form
of Worship contrary to the Purity and Uniformi∣ty
of the Worship of this Church establish'd by
Law. Wherefore, the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did, and hereby
do, unanimously, prohibit and discharge the said
Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> to exercise any Part of the Office
of the Holy Ministry within their Bounds, and
recommends to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
other Judges competent, to render this Sentence
effectual, declaring always, that the <HI>Presbytery</HI> re∣serves

notwithstanding of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>'s Sentence, and
their Certification, the said Mr. <HI>James Greenshields</HI>
had continued in excercising the Ministerial Fun∣ction
within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in his <HI>Meeting-House;</HI>
whereupon, the said Justices did, this Day,
again call for him before them; and did interro∣gate
him, if, or not, he us'd any Part of his Mini∣sterial
Function since his last Sentence; judicially
acknowledg'd he preach'd and perform'd Divine
Service, publickly, upon <HI>Sabbath</HI> last, being the

<P>It would be too long to descant here upon
the loud Clamour rais'd over <HI>England,</HI> of
the Persecution of this Reverend Man, as
they call'd him, tho' the Man himself, more
eminent for Singing Bawdy Songs, and for
other Immoralities, than any Reverend Be∣haviour
as a <HI>Minister of the Gospel,</HI> was a
Person they ought to have been asham'd of;
but it serv'd the Design so well, that the
Man, being acted by a private Party in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and supported from thence by large
Supplies, lay long in the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> till their
Affairs ripen'd, in <HI>England,</HI> to a Head, and
till a Party came in that might bring all
their Designs to pass.</P>
<P>When these Things, I say, began to ri∣pen,
they proceeded, and the first Thing he

a <HI>Bill of Suspension,</HI> as it is call'd there; and

both, and so let him judge for himself: The

<P>MY Lords of Council and Session, unto your

alledged Exercising the Holy Ministry, without
the Allowance of any Church Judicatory, and
bringing in Rites and Ceremonies, contrary to the
Purity and Uniformity of the Establish'd Church

exercise any part of the Holy Ministry within

effectual: Who upon the Tenth Day of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>
last by past, did interpose their Authority
to the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and did expresly
prohibit me to exercise any Part of the Holy Mi∣nistry
within the Bounds and Liberties of the
good Town of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> with Certification, that
it I transgressed in any part of the Premises, I
should be Imprisoned in the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and suffer such other Punishments as they should
think fit to inflict upon me: And, for alledged
contravening of their said Sentence, by preaching
<PB N="215" REF="226"/>
and performing Divine Service, publickly, upon the
<HI>Sabbath-Day</HI> thereafter, having caused actually
incarcerate me within their, <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> therein to
remain ay, and while I find caution to desist
from the Exercise of my Ministry, within the
City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and Suburbs thereof, in time
coming: Most wrongously and unjustly consider∣ing
it is of Verity, that I being legally Ordain'd
a Minister of the Gospel, did for some time, serve
the Cure at the said Church of <HI>Tynan,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
under one of the Prebendaries of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and
was duly qualified, both to the late King <HI>William,</HI>
and to Her present Majesty; and am known to be
well Affected to the present Government, as will
appear from ample Testificates of my Qualifi∣tions
and good Behaviour, from the Arch-Bishop
of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and the Clergy of that Diocese: And
having occasion to come over here, about my
necessary Affairs, before I was ready to return
the said Prebendary, under whom I had the
Cure at the Church of <HI>Tynan,</HI> happen'd to die,
and I thereby render'd detestitute of a Charge;
and being, at the same time, earnestly invited,
and desired by several Persons here, who are of
the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> their
Native Country, and who did not join with the
present Establish'd Church here; (so that no Esta∣blish'd
Minister's Charge was encroach'd upon:)
And having Council and Advice, that there was
no Law to the Contrary, was so prevail'd upon to
preach, and read Prayers to these Persons, after
the Form of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And I en∣gaged
in this the more readily, when I consider'd,
that the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Dissenting Ministers in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
(where they have no Toleration from
the Government, as in <HI>England</HI>) and who are for
<PB N="216" REF="227"/>
the most part, <HI>Scots-men,</HI> if they be qualified ac∣cording
to Law, and preach, and live as becomes,
are never disturbed by the regular Clergy; but
they enjoy the free Exercise of Religion, after
their own Way, almost in every Parish: And I
did expect that their Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI> would
not do to others, what they would not have others
do to them. Having thus laid before your Lord∣ships
the Matter of Fact, and Circumstances there∣of,
it is evident, that the Procedure and Sentences
both of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> and good Town of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
have no Ground nor Foundation in Law, and so
are most unwarrantable; for the Reasons follow∣ing.
<HI>Primo,</HI> I being legally ordained a Minister,
and duly qualified as such, am under the Pro∣tection
and Favour of the Government, by several
Laws and Acts of Parliament; and particularly,
by the Sixteenth Act of the Meeting of the States
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> holden in <HI>Anno</HI> One thousand six
hundred and ninety nine Years, whereby it is
prohibited and discharged, that no Injury be offe∣red
by any Person whosoever, to any Minister of
the Gospel, either of Church or Meeting-House, in
the Possession and Exercise of the Ministry there∣in,
they behaving themselves as becomes under the
present Government. And therefore, the foresaid
Sentence of Imprisonment and Execution thereof,
is manifestly illegal and without Warrand; Espe∣cially
considering, <HI>Secundo,</HI> That the only Reason
assigned for the Sentence, is, that I did judicially
acknowledge, that I preached and performed Di∣vine
Service, publickly, upon a Sabbath-Day, after
I was discharged therefrom by the <HI>Presbytery</HI> of
the Bounds, and in contempt also of the Magi∣strates
Sentence, interposing their Authority to the
<HI>Presbytery</HI>'s aforesaid prohibition; with and under
<PB N="217" REF="228"/>
the Certification, not only of Imprisonment, but
of such other Punishment as they should think
fit to inflict; which Reason can never be sustained
to support the foresaid Sentence in Law, there
being none that authorizes, or gives Warrand to
any <HI>Presbytery,</HI> or other Church Judicature, to pro∣hibit
and discharge any Minister from Preaching,
or having publick Prayers in his own Family, or
other private House, which is all that I do; un∣less
it could be qualified, that the Doctrine preach∣ed
by me was Erroneous, or that my Prayers con∣tained
any thing not warranted from the Word
of God, and Rule of our Faith, which, in the pre∣sent
Case, was not so much as alledged, or that
any thing was said or spoke by me, in my said
Religious Performance, shewing any Disloyalty to
the present Established Government. And as no
Church Judicature had any Authority from Law,
to issue out such a Prohibition, much less are the
Magistrates of the Good Town authoriz'd to give
their Authority thereto, and that by pronouncing
a Sentence of Imprisonment, and other Punish∣ments
against the Transgressors. For albeit Ma∣gistrates,
Judges and other Officers of Justice, are
by Law required to give all due Assistance, for
making the Sentences and Censures of the Church
and Judicatories thereof, to be obey'd, yet that can
be only understood of Church Censures, with respect
to the Corruption of Life or Doctrine, or of such
Sentences within their Spheres, and Jurisdiction,
which can never be extended to the present Case,
or beyond Ministers and Preachers within the
Churches Communion, whereof the Suspender is
not. And that the Church's Jurisdiction is thus
restricted over Ministers and Preachers, admitted
and continued within their Communion, does evi-dently
<PB N="218" REF="229"/>
appear from the 23<HI>d Act,</HI> of the Parliament holden
in <HI>Anno</HI> 1693. Yea farther, so careful are our Laws
of giving their Protection to all Ministers and
Preachers of the Gospel that are qualified to the
Civil Government, that albeit they do not sub∣scribe
the <HI>Confssion of Faith,</HI> own and acknowledge
the present Government of this Church, not to ob∣serve
the same <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Worship, that the pre∣sent
Government does enjoin and practise, as is re∣quired
by the foresaid 23<HI>d Act,</HI> which concerns
only Ministers in Churches, and those of the
Churches Communion, as said is; yet the samin
is dispensed with, and the Law in so far derogate
from, by posterior Laws, and particularly by the
27<HI>th Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> holden in <HI>Anno</HI> 1694.
whereby 'tis provided and declared, That all Mi∣nisters
who shall duly qualify themselves, by Ta∣king
the Oath of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and subscribing the
<HI>Assurance,</HI> without Imposing upon them the other
Qualifications mention'd in the said 23d <HI>Act</HI> of
the Parliament, 1693, with respect to the Church
Government, and Form of Worship, shall have
the Government's Protection, as to their Kirks,
Benefices and Stipends. Which Act, in Favours
of the said Ministers, is ratified by the <HI>Act</HI> 2d, of
the Parliament 1700. <HI>Act 3d</HI> Parliament 1702,
and <HI>Act 2d</HI> Parliament 1703. And if the Law
does thus dispense with the want of <HI>Unifor∣mity</HI>
of Worship in Favours of Ministers in the
Possession of Churches, and protects them in
their Rights and Benefices, notwithstanding of
the foresaid <HI>23d Act</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1693, which may
be said to comprehend them; then much less can
the said <HI>Act,</HI> with respect to what it requires, as to
the <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Worship, and Owning of the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government, be extended to Preachers
<PB N="219" REF="230"/>
that are qualified to the Government, who Preach
and Pray only in private Houses, tho' in a differ∣ent
Form and Manner from that of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Church, since the Form and Manner of Worship
observ'd by the Suspender is not Reprobat, or dis∣charged
by any Law. And my Case can never be
said to be comprehended by the foresaid 23d <HI>Act,</HI>
I neither being received in the Communion of this
Church, nor in the Enjoyment of any Benefice.
<HI>Tertio,</HI> As it thus appears, that the above Proce∣dure
against me, has no Foundation or Warrand
from the Acts of Parliament; so it cannot possibly
be warranted from any pretended <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Com∣mission</HI>
of the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> who has no Legal
Power to Form or Make any <HI>Acts,</HI> with respect to
those without their Communion, who have their
freedom to choise what Form or Manner of Di∣vine
Worship they think most agreeable, provi∣ding
the same be not discharged by the Civil Au∣thority.
<HI>Quarto,</HI> The restraining of Mens Liber∣ties
without a legal Ground, is such a horrid In∣justice
to Nature, (Liberty and Freedom being the
most valuable Interests of Mankind) that the Laws
of all Nations and human Societies do anxiously
provide for the Security of Liberty, by inflicting
of severe Punishments upon the Unjust Restrainers
thereof. And herein our own Laws are not de∣fective,
as appears from the <HI>6th Act</HI> of the Parlia∣ment
1701, by which most excellent Law, full
Provision is made, for securing of the Liberties of
the Subject, and against their <HI>Wrongous Imprison∣ment.</HI>
And since my Imprisonment (which has
continu'd for near two Months, to the great Pre∣judice
of my Health, as well as of the Means of
Subsistence of my self, and numerous Family) pro∣ceeds
upon a Sentence, without the least Warrand,
<PB N="220" REF="231"/>
or any Shadow of Law, as appears From the Pre∣misses;
Therefore the foresaid s Prohibitions and
Sentences against me, ought to be <HI>Simpliciter</HI> Su∣spended
by your Lordships, and I Ordain'd to be
set at Liberty, and that without finding of Cau∣tion,
as the Warrand for my Imprisonment requires.
<HI>HEREFORE, I beseech your Lardships, for your War∣rand
and Deliverance, for Letters of</HI> Suspension <HI>and</HI>
Liberation, <HI>in the Premisses,</HI> in Communi Forma;
According to Justice and your Lordships Answer.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Session Examining this
<HI>Appeal,</HI> and, upon a fall Hearing of both
Parties, gave it against Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> in
Favour of the Magistrates.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> having no farther In∣structions
from his Party, at that Time, sat
still so long, that their Resolution of Appeal∣ing
to the House of Lords in the <HI>British</HI> Par∣liament,
could not be put in Practise, the
Time, Ten Days, which the Laws of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
requires for such <HI>Appeals,</HI> being elapsed.
But to retrieve this, he presents a second
<HI>Appeal,</HI> or <HI>Bill of Suspension,</HI> to the same
Purpose as the Former, but much longer,
and too tedious to be repeated here, and the
Lords of the Session rejecting it, as they did
before, he Appeal'd in Form to the <HI>British
Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, that the Reader may
be fully inform'd of the State of the Case
on both Sides, as I have, above, given you
the Form of the said <HI>Bill of Suspension,</HI> or
<PB N="221" REF="232"/>
<HI>Appeal,</HI> wherein the said <HI>Greenshields</HI> lays
down his <HI>Case,</HI> so I give you here the An∣swer

for their own Vindication, and which was
adjudg'd by the Lords of the Sessions to be
right, after which, on a full Hearing, the
Lords, a Second Time as above, giving it
against <HI>Greenshields,</HI> I give you the Form of
his <HI>Appeal,</HI> and his Letter to his Friends in
<HI>England,</HI> Reciting his <HI>Case</HI> his own Way;

<HEAD><DATE>November 4. 1709.</DATE>
ANSWERS for the Magistrates of the Good
Town of Edinburgh, to the Bill of Sus∣pension,
given in the Name of Mr. James
Greenshields, pretended late Minister of
the Church of Tynan in Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>THE Complainer, Mr. <HI>James Greenshields,</HI> with∣out
a Legal Vocation to be a lawful Minister
of any Church or Communion, having presump∣tuously
taken upon him to preach and exercise all
the Parts of the Ministerial Function in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and that at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and with an uncommon
Ostentation to practise what he had begun openly.</P>
<P>The Reverend <HI>Presbytery</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> did, very
suitable to their Duty, call him before them; And
he did so far acknowledge their just Authority as
to Compear, and did produce a pretended Act of
Ordination, bearing Date in <HI>August,</HI> 1694, by the
late Bishop of <HI>Ross,</HI> long after Prelacy, and all
<PB N="222" REF="233"/>
Superiority in Offices in this Kingdom above <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI>
had been abolish'd by King and Parliament,
in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Act of Parliament held in the Year 1689.</P>
<P>Tho' this pretended Ordination so manifestly
Defective; The said Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> pretended to
justifie, and carry'd himself so haughtily, as to
decline the Authority of the Church, which he had
the Minute before acknowledg'd, and then, with an
Ignorance equal to his Presumption, pretended to
be a <HI>Presbyter</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' his
Ordination was by an <HI>Exauctorate</HI> or no Bishop of
<HI>Scotland;</HI> and to support this, alledg'd an imagi∣nary
Incorporation of the Churches of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>England,</HI> and to compleat his Inconsistencies and
Follies, did endeavour to justifie this Incorpora∣tion
by the Act of Union, tho' it has most care∣fully
preserv'd the Establish'd <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church-Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and distinguish'd the Case
of the Church here, from that in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot seem strange, that the Reverend <HI>Pres∣bytery</HI>
did discharge the Complainer in these Cir∣cumstances
to preach, seeing he had not so much
as the Pretence of Authority, and was in Effect a
<HI>Layman,</HI> assuming to himself Orders in a Place
where there is a Church establish'd by Law, with
Power of Discipline; And seeing there appear'd so
much Presumption, both in the Manner and in the
Matter of his Defence; The <HI>Presbytery</HI> did most
justly require the Civil Magistrate, to take care
that such should not be admitted to preach to the
People.</P>
<P>The Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who were at the
same time call'd upon by great Numbers of People,
by a Petition, craving, That a Restraint might be
put to such Abuses, did nevertheless proceed with
the outmost Moderation and Tenderness and on∣ly
<PB N="223" REF="234"/>
call'd the Complainer before them, admonish∣ing
him to forbear Preaching, and obey the Sen∣tence
of the <HI>Presbytery;</HI> Which he having trans∣gress'd,
and thereby contemn'd both <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI>
and <HI>Civil Authority;</HI> The Magistrates did Impri∣son
him, untill he should find Caution for his good
Behaviour and Obedience.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>James Greenshields</HI> the Complainer, has
rather chosen to present this Bill of Suspension,
hoping without doubt, if he may prevail, a Door
may be open'd to greater Disorders, and has for
that End stuft his <HI>Bill</HI> with many Things Foreign
to the Purpose.</P>
<P>The Reasons of <HI>Suspension</HI> are usher'd in with a
Narrative of the Complainer's being Legally Or∣dain'd
a <HI>Minister of the Gospel,</HI> and his having some∣time
serv'd the Cure at the Church of <HI>Tynan</HI> in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> under a Prebend of <HI>Armagh,</HI> by which
one should be attempted to believe he had been
Ordain'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and afterwards had preach'd
there, till he had come over to <HI>Scotland</HI> lately, and
after his inconsistent Way, he is a <HI>Minister</HI> of the
<HI>Church of Scotland, England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> but by
Authority of no legal Million in these, or any
Church whatever, and what Incorporation he will
find to joyn all these, is hardly to be foreseen:
The Truth is, That he is not legally Ordain'd at
<HI>Minister</HI> any where; but being a <HI>Curate</HI> under a
<HI>Prebendary</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is come, by his private Au∣thority,
to create Disturbances here.</P>
<P>The Complainer pretends to give good Evi∣dence
of his Affection and Qualifications to the
Government; but the Ordination from an <HI>Ex∣auctorate
Bishop,</HI> who never own'd its Authority,
nor the Supremacy of King <HI>William,</HI> nor of Her
Majesty; as by their own Principles they ought;
<PB N="224" REF="235"/>
and the Complalner's Coming over to disturb the
Establishment of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> so well
affected to <HI>Civil Government,</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Suc∣cession:</HI>
The warm Support the Complainer meets
with here, from People who have given no good
Evidence of <HI>Affection</HI> to it, I say, this Conduct
does very ill agree with the pretended <HI>Loyalty</HI> the
Complainer boasts of.</P>
<P>It were unnecessary to give the Lord Ordinary
the Trouble, to examine the Account the Com∣plainer
gives of his being invited to preach, and
use the <HI>Service</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> here, of
which he will be hardly able to give any good
Evidence, neither will it be to the present Pur∣pose
to give particular Answers to several other
affected Reasons, no Ways belonging to the Case,
and therefore the Good Town shall content them∣selves
to answer only such Reasons, which may
seem to concern the Subject of the Complaint.</P>
<P>The Complainer's first Reason is, That, being
Ordain'd a lawful <HI>Minister,</HI> he has the Benefit of
the 16th Act of the Meeting of the Estates of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> whereby it is <HI>prohibited and discharg'd,
that any Injury be offer'd by any Person whatsomever,
to any Ministers of the Gospel, either in their Churches
or Meeting-Houses.</HI></P>
<P>But the Complaner forgets the following Words,
(<HI>Who are presently in the Possession and Exercise of
their Ministry therein, and behave as becomes under
the present Government</HI>) and it's certain, the Com∣plainer
neither does, nor pretends to subsume in
the Terms of the Act, nor of any of the Acts
mention'd in his <HI>Bill;</HI> and it were a Matter of
very bad Consequence, if the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the
<HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> in this Part of Her
Majesty's Kingdom, should admit a Person to
<PB N="225" REF="236"/>
preach upon a pretended Ordination, by an Au∣thority
abolish'd by the <HI>Civil Power,</HI> and contrary
to the <HI>Ecclesiastick Establishment;</HI> these, whom the
Act of the <HI>Convention</HI> did protect, were <HI>Ministers,</HI>
who, at least, were own'd as such by one Side or
other; but this Complainer is in a quite different
Case, being Ordain'd in Manner foresaid; nor
does this Question only concern this Part of the
Island, for there were <HI>Exauctorated Bishops</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
at the Time of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> as well as in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but never any such were allowed to Or∣dain,
which would be to allow a perpetual Schism.</P>
<P>2. The Complainer does much insist upon the
Church's Want of Power over others, than these of
their own Communion, but at the same time ac∣knowledges,
the Church has the Power of Disci∣pline,
as to Immoralities and Errors, and that the
Civil Magistrate ought to put their Sentence in
Execution: Now, by the Complainer's own Way
of Reasoning, the Church had good Reason to en∣quire,
Whether he was a Minister or no? And if
he was not, to restrain him, as not having a Missi∣on
from any Authority acknowledg'd by any
<HI>Church,</HI> and consequently the <HI>Magistrates</HI> were in
their Duty to put the Sentence in Execution, and
might have punish'd the Complainer personally;
but yet they have contented themselves only to
Imprison him, till he finds Caution for Obedience.</P>
<P>The good Town does reckon themselves in this
Case concern'd to answer, what the Petitioner en∣deavours
to set forth so earnestly, That he suffers
for using the Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
tho' it is very plain, that these Ceremonies had not,
at the Time of the Revolution, the Authority of
any Ecclesiastick Judicature, nor Civil in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
nor can ever have it now. Nor is it less certain,
that by the Complainer's own Principles, no Forms
<PB N="226" REF="237"/>
can be introduc'd into any <HI>Episcopal</HI> Church, with∣out
Concourse of both: But the Complainer being
no <HI>Presbyter</HI> of any Sort and in Effect a <HI>Lay-Man,</HI>
was justly call'd by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and forbid to
preach which is enough to support the <HI>Presbytery's</HI>
Sentence, as that Sentence is sufficient Ground for
the Magistrates to have proceeded, as they have
done.</P>
<P>And where the Complainer alledges, That the
Magistrates had no Warrant, by any special Law,
to Imprison in the Case foresaid.</P>
<P>It is answer'd, That all the Parts of the Magi∣strates
Authority need not special Acts, <HI>Concessa
Jurisdictione ea omnia concessa videntur, sine quibus
exerceri non potest;</HI> The Magistrates have Power to
prevent Disorders, and are in Law bound to see
the lawful Sentences of the Church put to Execu∣tion
against the Scandalous, Erroneous and De∣pos'd
Clergy-men, and much more against such
who pretend a Mission in Defiance to the publick
Law, and having that Power, they have thereby
the Power of Imprisonment, without which, the
other could not take Effect.</P>
<P>But to give the Lords a plain Account of this
Matter, by the Act of Parliament 1663, it is ex∣presly
Statute, <HI>That no Person be continued or allow'd
to be a Preacher within this Church, unless be comply
with the Conditions there set down;</HI> And more par∣ticularly,
<HI>That no Preacher be allow'd or continued
within the same, unless he actually observe the Unifor∣mity
of Worship observ'd in this Church;</HI> And by the
6th Act of Parliament, 1707, the foresaid Act is
Ratify'd; and it is expresly provided, <HI>That the
Form and Purity of Worship presently in Use within
this Church, shall remain and continue unalterable;</HI>
And this is yet more solemnly secur'd by the Trea∣ty
of Union. Now, if after all this, a Man from
<PB N="227" REF="238"/>
<HI>Ireland,</HI> pretending to be a lawful Minister, and
who yet can give no Account of a good Ordina∣tion,
shall come and preach here, and let up and
use Foreign Rites and Ceremonies, contrary to the
Purity and Uniformity of Worship establishsd in
this Church; can there be any thing more proper
for the Church, than to take Notice, and Restrain
such a vagrant pestilent Practiser; specially when
he acknowledges, if he were preaching Error, he
might be restrain'd by virtue of the foresaid Acts?
But so it is, that these Acts are equally for the Pu∣rity
and Uniformity of Worship against all Inno∣vations,
as they are for the Truth of the Confession
of Faith against Error, and consequently it did be∣long
to the Church and <HI>Presbytery,</HI> to take Notice
of this Complainer, having no lawful Character,
and practising so disorderly contrary to Law; and
the least they could do, was to forbid and dis∣charge
him, which he contemning, the Church is
so warranted by the same Law, to apply to the
Civil Magistrates, to make their Sentences Effe∣ctual;
and the Civil Magistrate could not in Law
take any other Method to that Effect, than what
they have done: And the Imprisonment that hath
hereon ensued, is more warrantable, no ways with∣in
the Compass of the Act against wrongous Im∣prisonment,
since it expressy excepts all Imprison∣ments
by Virtue of Sentences; And therefore, since
the Complainer has been so Disorderly and Tur∣bulent,
and that both the Ecclesiastick and Civil
Judicatory have proceeded against him most le∣gally
and regularly, and that in Effect he may re∣lieve
himself when he will, if he can but bow to a
just Compliance, in all Reason and good Sense, his
Bill ought to be refus'd.</P>

Diocese of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> Where∣as
I am incarcerate in the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by
vertue of a Warrand issued against me by the Ma∣gistrates
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for Disobedience to their
pretended Sentence, interposing their Authority to
<PB N="229" REF="240"/>
a Decree made by the Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
against me for performing of Divine Service after
the manner of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in a private
Way, to those at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> of the Communion of
that Church; Albeit, according to my Council and
Advice, there is no Law or Statute in <HI>Scotland</HI> to
the Contrary; and I having made Application, by
way of Two Suspensions to the Lords of Council
and Session, against my laid Imprisonment, as be∣ing
illegal and unwarrantable, and judging myself
lesed by the Interloquitors and Sentences of the
said Lords refusing my saids Bills; do, therefore,
hereby protest for Remead of Law against the
same; and appeal from them to Her Majesty and
the House or Lords for Justice and Redress. And
because of my being incapacitate, by reason of my
did Imprisonment, to offer and present this my
Appeal, I do, therefore, impower, and grant War∣rand
to <HI>William Allan,</HI> Writer in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
Procurator before the Commissars thereof, to offer
and present, and make the same for me and in my
Name; and to do and exerce every thing there∣anent,
that I might do myself, if personally present;
which I shall hold firm and stable. In Witness
whereof I have written and subscriv'd these Pre∣sents,
at the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Twenty
eighth day of <HI>December,</HI> one thousand seven hun∣dred

Power, in Name of the said Mr. <HI>James Greenshields,</HI>
for the Reasons above express'd, protested for Re∣mead

Queen's Majesty, and House of Lords, for Justice
and Redress; and thereupon, took Instruments in

<HEAD>Tolbooth of Edinburgh, December 5. 1709.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Reverend Sir,</OPENER>
<P>THIS is to inform you, that since my last to
you, I have applied to the Lords of our Sessi∣on,
for my Liberation, and gave in my Bill of
Suspension, which I have here inclos'd; but they,
instead of considering what, in my humble Opi∣nion,
<PB N="231" REF="242"/>
regularly they ought to have consider'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Cause of my Imprisonment, alledged
in the <HI>Presbytery's</HI> Sentence, and that of the
Magistrates in pursuance thereof, and their War∣rand
of Imprisonment thereupon, (all which I
send you inclos'd) namely, <HI>My bringing Rites and
Ceremonies into this Place, contrary to the Purity and
Uniformity of their Worship:</HI> I say, instead of con∣sidering
this, the Lords went off the State of the
Question, and finding no Way to attack me, as I
think, legally, fell upon a Notion afforded 'em by
the Magistrates Answer to my Bill, and first broach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
by Sir <HI>J—s St—t, That no Minister ordain'd by an
Exauctorated Bishop</HI> (for such they call all the Right
Reverend Bishops of this Church) <HI>has true Ordina∣tion.</HI>
What their Lordships Reasonings were upon
this Head, I design to publish at large; and shall
now only mention two of 'em. The first was of
the Lord <HI>M</HI>—<HI>o,</HI> who, after my Lord <HI>Gr</HI>—<HI>ge</HI>
had asserted and fully prov'd the Validity of my
Ordination, not only from the Principles and
Practices of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but also of
their own Kirk, learnedly confuted all he had
said, by this one positive Assertion, <HI>That an ex∣auctorated
Bishop has no more Power to ordain a Mi∣nister,
than a Ballad-Cryer in the Streets;</HI> and this
was supported by another Lord's Opinion, <HI>That
he had no more Power to Ordain, than a depos'd Co∣lonel
or Captain of Horse has to give Commissions to
Subalterns;</HI> so that upon the whole, my Bill was
refus'd, and I bereft of all Hopes that Way; so
that I am forc'd to appeal to Her Majesty, and
the House of Lords, from whose great Equity,
Moderation, and Justice, I hope for that Redress,
which I am so unhappy as not to be able to ob∣tain
in my Native Country. For, besides the
Hardship of my Case in particular; I presume to
<PB N="232" REF="243"/>
say, if my Persecutors are permitted to treat my
<HI>Episcopal Brethren,</HI> as they do, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> and with
Impunity, I am afraid they will attempt the Re∣vival
of their old <HI>Solemn League and Covenant.</HI>
For, that many of them think that still binding
on 'em, the following Instance, amongst many
others, may evince. At <HI>Sterling,</HI> within these ten
Weeks, they were placing a Minister; <HI>Logan,</HI>
who was the Preacher, and examin'd the new In∣trant,
ask'd him amongst many other Questions in
the Church of <HI>Sterling,</HI> many Hundreds present,
<HI>Whether be believ'd that the National, and Solemn
League, and Covenant, as it was binding upon their
Fathers, who took it, so also it was equally binding
upon them?</HI> And he was answer'd, <HI>he believ'd it
was;</HI> which is <HI>downright Treason,</HI> and contrary to
many Acts of Parliament unrepeal'd. So that I
think it may well be fear'd, that restless Tribe,
who are of this Opinion, may once again attempt
the Reformation of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to their
Model, and endeavour to propagate the same Re∣bellious
Notions in the Southern Parts of the
Island. So that a <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Episcopal Ministers</HI>
here, seems to be highly necessary for the Preser∣vation
of the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> of both Kingdoms,
the Service of Her Majesty, and Safety of the
Church happily establish'd in <HI>England.</HI> As for
the Ministers of the other Perswasions, whatever
<HI>Pretences</HI> they may make to Loyalty, I can affirm,
that there are two <HI>Episcopal Ministers,</HI> who have
taken the Oaths to Her Majesty, for one of them,
in Proportion to their different Numbers; that
before I came to this City, I heard Nine of them
preach and pray, and never heard one of them
name the Queen in their Prayers. Nay, some of
them had the Insolence and Hardiness, to tell their
Congregations on the late Thanksgiving Day ap∣pointed
<PB N="233" REF="244"/>
by Her Majesty and Council, <HI>That they
were not come there out of any Obedience to the Queen's
Proclamation; but to their Synod, which had enjoin'd
that Thanksgiving for their good Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>I hope you will pardon the Tediousness of my
Letter, and believe me to be, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate Brother,
And humble Servant,
<SIGNED>JAMES GREENSHIELDS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>Thus far the Proceedings in <HI>Scotland</HI> were
carry'd in this Affair; and the Appeal of
<HI>Greenshields</HI> having removed it to the House
of Peers; there his Party had so great an as∣cendant,
as to have his Cause carry'd; the
Sentence of the Lords of Session and Magi∣strates
of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> laid aside; but yet the
House of Peers could not be brought, that
Session, to meddle with the Sentence of the
<HI>Presbytery,</HI> and <HI>Greenshields,</HI> with all the
Victory he had obtain'd, did not think fit to
adventure to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> again to proceed with
his first Project till the Year after; when his
Party, finding the Publick Scene of Affairs in
<HI>England</HI> changing more to their Advantage,
push'd at, and carry'd Higher-Points than
all those, and such as, till then, we thought
impossible any Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
had a Right to do, or would ever make an
Attempt to go about. But, <HI>Tempora Mutan∣tur:</HI>
Our next Chapter must give an Ac∣count
of stranger Things than these.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Giving an Account of the Endeavours of
the Episcopal and Jacobite-Party in
Scotland, for the Invasion of the
Presbyterian Church, declaring the
Ʋnion alterable and breaking in upon
the express Articles of it; with their
Success in both.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE House of Lords, as is no∣ted
before, tho' they had
effectually revers'd the Sen∣tence
of the Magistrates of
<HI>Edinb.</HI> against Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI>
yet having not adven∣tured
to meddle with the Jurisdiction of the
Church, or determin'd, one Way or other,
the Validity of the Sentence of the <HI>Pres∣bytery.</HI>
The Victory the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Party
had obtain'd thereby, was not so compleat as
it was expected; neither did it any Way
answer the End of the Party, and therefore
still finding, as I said before, the Juncture
<PB N="235" REF="246"/>
favourable, and their Party so predominant,
that they thought nothing could be deny'd
them, they proceeded to such farther At∣tempts
in Parliament, in the Year 1711-12, as,
till then, it was generally thought they had
Assurance enough to hope for, neither did
many of their own Party think it was possi∣ble
for them to go the length we have since
found them: But this being an Age of Won∣ders,
nothing is now to seem Strange.</P>
<P>The first Step they took of this kind, was
to brirg in a <HI>Toleration</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
to Repeal such Acts of Parliament which
stood in their Way.</P>
<P>It was objected, That these Acts of Parli∣ament
were included in the Treaty of <HI>Union,</HI>
and that the Treaty was Essential, and Un∣alterable;
that the Power of the <HI>British Par∣liament</HI>
could not extend to it, and this, in∣deed,
was allow'd for a Reason, in the Par∣liament
before, when an Attempt of the like
Nature being offer'd, it was answer'd, <HI>That
the Parliament had not Power to do it.</HI></P>
<P>But to evade this; a New Proposition was
started, viz. That every Act of the <HI>Consti∣tution</HI>
was alterable by the Sovereign Power,
or Supreme Authority of the said <HI>Constitu∣tion;</HI>
but to leave it with more Authority,
I shall give it you in their own Words, <HI>viz.
Are not they Blockheads</HI> who say, <HI>That any
Thing is</HI> unalterable, <HI>because the Law says
'tis</HI> unalterable? <HI>Is there not a particular
<PB N="236" REF="247"/>
Act of Parliament in</HI> Scotland, <HI>which declares
the Lineal Succession of the Royal Family</HI> un∣alterable?
<HI>And is it not Treason to say,</HI>
That <HI>that could not be alter'd?</HI> Certainly,
where-ever there is a Sovereign Power they
not only can, but have alter'd every Thing,
which many foolishly think is either unal∣terable
in its own Nature, or the Law has
declar'd unalterable: He is a Stranger to our
<HI>Constitution</HI> who can call any thing Funda∣mental
but the present <HI>Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foot they made no Scruple to
lay Schemes for over-turning the Whole
Establishment of the Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and undoing all that was settled there by the
Union. I shall not make this a Discourse of
Controversie, about the Power the <HI>British</HI>
Parliament has, or has not, to alter, or resind
the Union; but I may, as a Quotation, give
you something which was then offer'd in
Opposition to that Notion; It is no matter
by whom, and which, till answer'd, may
remain as an Essential, or Fundamental, upon
which those People, who laid a Stress upon
the Union, built their Claim.</P>
<P>The Designs of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI>
Party, <HI>for they are but one Party and one Peo∣ple,</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> having been manifestly driven
on, at the Ruin of the <HI>Presbyterian Establish∣ment</HI>
there; they knew it was impossible to
bring this to pass, but by Sapping the Foun∣dations
of the <HI>Union,</HI> which had declar'd the
<PB N="237" REF="248"/>
said Establishment of the Church, as well as
many other Things, to be <HI>Unalterable:</HI> This
crabbed unhappy Word they could not bear,
for if it remain'd, they could never Master
the <HI>Presbyterian Settlement,</HI> which was the
Eye-Sore of the Party, both there and here,
and which the <HI>Union</HI> had perpetuated.</P>
<P>To this purpose they bent all their little
Cavils at this fatal Word <HI>Unalterable,</HI> which
if they could hut <HI>get over,</HI> every Thing would
be easie to them <HI>after it;</HI> and as often as they
can get a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Ascendant in the Ministry,
or Parliament, they will push at that Funda∣mental
Constitution of <HI>Britain,</HI> the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>To come therefore close to the Point, I
shall Examin the Validity of this Word <HI>Un∣alterable,</HI>
in the Articles of <HI>Union,</HI> and in do∣ing
this, I think it will appear,</P>
<P>1. That it is the only Essential, which gives
Strength and Value to that Great Transaction,
and that all the rest is of no Consequence or
Consideration without it.</P>
<P>2. That without it, <HI>the whole Union</HI> is a
Cheat, a Snare laid to Entrap a whole Nati∣on,
a Politick Fraud, back'd with Court Assu∣rances,
Royal Authorities, and Parliamentary
Ratifications, on purpose to draw in an Inno∣cent
People to depend upon empty Notions,
Inconsistent in themselves, and of no Signifi∣cation.</P>
<P>3. That without it, Her Majesty would
seem not only to deceive Herself in the Joy
<PB N="238" REF="249"/>
She conceiv'd at the making the <HI>Union,</HI> but
Her People also, in the Hopes She gave them
of the future Peace and Happiness they might
expect, as the Consequences of this <HI>Union;
vid. Her Majesty's Speeches to the Parliament
at the passing the Act of</HI> Union, <HI>and several
before, during the Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>4. That the Makers of this <HI>Union,</HI> both in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> understood it to be
UNALTERABLE, and that as such, it
pass'd in those very Terms, and that there∣fore
the Words <HI>Alterable</HI> and <HI>Unalterable,</HI>
were put into the Treaty, where they stand
as a Testimony against them.</P>
<P>If this be prov'd, then I firmly believe I
prove, That no Constituted Human Power
upon Earth has a Legal Right to ALTER,
Explain, Add to, or Diminish from that
Treaty; and that when any Infraction is
made into it, by any Power which receives
its Constitution from it, that Constitution,
<HI>the Union being broken,</HI> dies, dissolves, and
ceases to be a Constitution from that Time, by
the very Nature of the very <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>As I am writing to the common Under∣standing,
so I appeal to every Reader, whe∣ther
it was not our Expectation or Belief,
That an Eternal End was put to the Strife
of the Two Nations; whether it was not
understood, That neither had Power to break
this <HI>Union?</HI> Whether it was not the gene∣ral
receiv'd Notion we had of it, That it was
<PB N="239" REF="250"/>
as much <HI>Unalterable,</HI> as any thing in Human
Nature could be so, or as the Wit and Capa∣city
of Men could devise?</P>
<P>But come we next to the <HI>Union itself:</HI> Why
is it said in the 17th, and the 18th, and the
19th Articles of the <HI>Union,</HI> and several others,
That such and such Parts shall be <HI>neverthe∣less
alterable</HI> by a Parliament of <HI>Great Bri∣tain?</HI>
And why is it said in others <HI>Unalter∣able,
and without any Alteration for ever,</HI> as
in the <HI>Act for the Security of the Church of</HI>
England, <HI>as well as of the Church of</HI> Scotland,
Article 25? Does not the expressing, That
this or that Part shall be <HI>Alterable,</HI> most
strongly infer, That the rest is to be un∣derstood,
not to be <HI>Alterable,</HI> even by the
Parliament? And does not the express Ar∣ticling
in the Act of Security aforesaid, That
such a Thing shall be <HI>Unalterable,</HI> and shall
for that purpose be incerted in, and made
part of the <HI>Act of Union</HI> unanswerably con∣firm,
That what was in the said <HI>Union,</HI> was
of course <HI>Unalterable,</HI> except otherwise ex∣press'd,
because the <HI>Union</HI> itself was so?</P>
<P>But a Difficulty remains here, which they
think we dare not enter into, for fear of the
Parliament, <HI>viz.</HI> What do we mean by <HI>Un∣alterable?</HI>
Is it, or can any thing be <HI>Unalter∣able</HI>
by the Parliament of <HI>Britain?</HI> Or is
any Thing <HI>Unalterable</HI> by a Sovereign Power?
And this is their boast.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Jacobites</HI> shew their Weakness
<PB N="240" REF="251"/>
here, and are mistaken in our Parliament;
for a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, having the Bounds
of their Sovereign Power declared <HI>in the
Laws,</HI> in the Claims of Right, in the <HI>Custom
and Usage</HI> of Parliament, and in the known
Parts of the Constitution, are never displeased
that the Subjects of <HI>Britain,</HI> the Freeholders
and Freemen whom they represent, should
know the Powers, Rights, and Foundations
upon which they act, and all the several
Extents and Limitations of those Powers,
Rights, and Foundations.</P>
<P>And what a Scandal and Reproach do such
Men cast on a <HI>British</HI> Parliament? Or what
kind of a Monster would they make of it,
That a Man should not dare to speak Known,
Legal, and Necessary Truths for fear of their
Resentment? As if a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, <HI>horri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Suggestion!</HI> Could be suppos'd to resent, or
be offended at a plain, just, clear Representa∣tion
of Truth in Fact, whether relating to
their own Constitution, or any thing else:
The Parliament are our Protectors in that
Happy Liberty of <HI>speaking plain Truths,</HI> the
want of which Liberty makes other Nations
Slaves, and comfortably distinguishes <HI>English∣men</HI>
from all the Nations of the World.</P>
<P>And therefore it is no Treason, or Offence,
to say, The Parliament <HI>cannot</HI> do this or that,
or <HI>have not</HI> this or that Power, for it is ap∣parent,
That the Parliament may have some,
<HI>and really have several</HI> Limitations to their
<PB N="241" REF="252"/>
Legal Power. And as I am now speaking to
<HI>Jacobites,</HI> what if I should throw into their
Teeth, <HI>their own Doctrine</HI> of the Divine Right
of the Person of the Prince, and the Descent
of the Crown <HI>in the right Line,</HI> which they
call <HI>Inderfeizible,</HI> and which they say is <HI>not in
the Power</HI> of Parliament to <HI>alter?</HI> Tho' this
is far from being my Opinion, and I think it
a ridiculous System, yet it is <HI>upon this Foot
alone that they can remain Jacobites;</HI> and
therefore It is a good Reason to them, and
an Argument which I believe they cannot
answer.</P>
<P><HI>But to descend plianly to the thing:</HI> With
all Deference and Duty to the Parliament,
and as I think, with a well-guided Zeal to
the Constitution; I shall lay down my No∣tion
of the <HI>Unalterable</HI> Quality of the <HI>Union,</HI>
and the Reason why I think, even the Par∣liament
itself cannot <HI>ALTER</HI> one Tittle of
it, except what is declared in the Act of
<HI>Union</HI> to be <HI>Alterable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I lay down my Assumption thus:</HI> Every
Power on Earth derives from some others
Power Prior, and therefore Superiour to it
self as every Created Being is inferior, both
in Dignity and Power, to <HI>that Being which
created it.</HI></P>
<P>The Two separate Constitutions of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> from which <HI>in their Treat∣ing
Capacity, the present united</HI> Constitution
of <HI>Britain</HI> was produced, being Prior to, and
creating <HI>this united Constitution,</HI> were <HI>in that
<PB N="242" REF="253"/>
Capacity,</HI> superior to the present <HI>Constitution,</HI>
as they were prior to, and created it.</P>
<P>I infer from hence, That the said Two
separate <HI>Constitutions</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>
having by <HI>Treaty and mutual Stipulation,
which is called the Union,</HI> formed and con∣stituted,
or created one Body, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Pre∣sent
Constitution, the Body so formed, is the
Daughter or Child of that Union.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I infer next,</HI> That this <HI>Union</HI> of the Two
<HI>Constitutions,</HI> having produced this said Body,
or subsequent <HI>Constitution,</HI> had a Power to
bind and limit the said <HI>subsequent,</HI> which
Bounds and Limits, the said <HI>subsequent,
which is the present Constitution of</HI> Britain,
has no Legal Right to break.</P>
<P>If this be true, then I see no Crime in as∣serting,
That the <HI>British Parliament</HI> cannot
go beyond the Limits of the <HI>Treaty;</HI> it is our
Satisfaction that the <HI>Parliament is sitting,</HI>
while this is Writing, and so we know who
hears: Let then the <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> who
stand openly up for a Breach of the <HI>Trea∣ty,</HI>
and would fain involve us in Confu∣sion
I say, let <HI>them</HI> stand forth, and an∣swer
it if they can to the <HI>Parliament, or if
not,</HI> they ought to be censured for reproach∣ing
the <HI>British Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>It seems a very unhappy Crisis, that a
Treaty of Union being, with the greatest So∣lemnity
imaginable, made with the <HI>Scots,</HI>
vast Sums given to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and some spent
<PB N="243" REF="254"/>
in the bringing the great Transaction to pass,
it should, within less than five Year, become a
Question among us, whither this Union
can be broken by us, or no; it seem'd much
more reasonable to expect, that the Pub∣lick
should have study'd Ways and Means
farther to Confirm and Establish the said
Union, and to Cultivate and Improve it, let∣ting
the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> see that they
were Gainers, and should be improv'd by the
Union, that they should taste of the Sweets
of <HI>English</HI> Liberty, and that Trade should
flow in upon them, and their Wealth and
Riches encrease.</P>
<P>But instead of this, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> and <HI>Epis∣copal</HI>
Party study'd all the Ways they could
devise to Insult and Affront the <HI>Constitution</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> and finding all Things ripe
for their Designs, they began in Parliament,
by getting a Bill to be brought in <HI>for set∣ting
up the</HI> English <HI>Liturgy in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and
Tollerating the Episcopal Meetings,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It was not the first time that this had been
driven at by the <HI>High-Party,</HI> nor could the
greatest Effort for the bringing it to pass be¦fore
ever succeed.</P>
<P>The History of this is very short, and
shall be shorter here, because I shall give you
the Act itself, at least such part of it as is
most material, the Act itself being insepar∣able
from the Story.</P>

and Mr. <HI>Robert Bailie,</HI> Minister of <HI>Inver∣ness,</HI>
being all then in Town, presented the
following Petition to the Parliament.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To the Honourable the Commons of Great
Britain, in Parliament Assembled.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble Petition of William Carstairs,
Dr. in Divinity, Principal of the College at
Edinburgh, Thomas Blackwell, Professor
of Divinity at Aberdeen, and Robert Bailie,
Minister of Inverness.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Most humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>“THAT your Petitioners being Ministers of
the Establish'd Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and ve∣ry
much concern'd for the Peace and Well∣fare
thereof; and being inform'd, That a Bill is
depending in this Honourable House, entitled,
A Bill to prevent the Disturbing those of the Episco∣pal
Communion in <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Exercise of their
Religious Worship, and in the Use of the Liturgy of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and for Repealing the Act
against Irregular Baptisms and Marriages.”</P>
<P>“And the Comissioners of the Assembly of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being at a very great Distance
from this Honourable House, and having no
Notice of any such Bill depending; and the said
Bill being of very great Consequence to the Esta∣blish'd
Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and altering the Laws,
as well before, as upon die Union, (as your Pe∣titioners
<PB N="245" REF="256"/>
humbly conceive) made for its Preser∣vation,
and securing the Rights and Liberties
thereof.”</P>
<Q>Your Petitioners, in all Humility, presume to Peti∣tion
this Honourable House, That this House
would be pleased to allow a reasonable Time for
to send to the Commissioners of the Assembly in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> to acquaint them with the Contents of
the said Bill, before the same do pass, in regard
it so much concern'd the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
and also for, that there are several very extraor∣dinary
Clauses (as your Petitioners humbly con∣ceive)
in the said Bill, or otherwise, as your Pe∣titioners
apprehend it, will be a great surprize
to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to pass this Bill with∣out
their being heard, what they have humbly to
lay before this House against the same, or what
they have humbly to offer as Amendments thereof.</Q>
<CLOSER>And your Petitioners shall ever Pray.</CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<P>This Petition, however reasonable the
Request appear'd which was, in short, only
to be heard before the Bill pass'd, was reject∣ed,
and the House proceeded.</P>
<P>The Commission of the General Assembly
was all this while sitting in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
finding how Things were going, and that
they should not be heard in the House of
Commons, they drew up a very Pathetick
Representation to Her Majesty, on the Sub∣ject
of their Establishment and Privileges;
which Representation being a recital of the
Fundamental Establishment of their said Pri∣vileges,
is the best History that can be given
<PB N="246" REF="257" MS="y"/>
of the Thing itself, and therefore I thought
it most useful in this Place.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To the Queen's most Excellent Majestry.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The most humble Representation and Petition
of the Commission of the late General As∣sembly
of the Church of Scotland.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please Your Majesty,</OPENER>
<P>THE Church of Christ in Scotland being, as
we apprehend, in hazard of sad Alterations
and Innovations, inconsistent with, and con∣trary
to that happy Establishment secur'd to us
by the Laws, both of God and the Realm, from
a Bill, intituled, <HI>A Bill to prevent the disturbing those
of the Episcopal Communion, in that Part of</HI> Great Bri∣tain,
<HI>call'd</HI> Scotland, <HI>in the Exercise of their Religious
Worship, and in the Use of the Liturgy of the Church of</HI>
England; <HI>and for repealing an Act of Parliament against
Irreguler Baptism and Marriages.</HI> We do in all Duty
and Humility fly to Your Majesty's Royal Pro∣tection,
so often and so graciously assur'd to us,
both by Your Royal Word and Letters.</P>
<P>If the Matters in Question did only relate to
our own Ease, and better Accomodation, we should
patiently bear the same: But when we see the Glo∣ry
of God, and the Power and Purity of our Holy
Religion, and of the Ordinances of Jesus Christ in
this Church so much concern'd, and the Peace and
Quiet thereof, and of this whole Country so visibly
in Danger, to the Prejudice of Your Majesty's
Honour and Governnent; We cannot but hope
Your Majesty will allow us to plead our just
Right, with that Gracious Liberty You were
pleas'd to give to the Meanest of Your Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="258"/>
When after the great and many Hardships,
Troubles and Vicissitudes, wherewith the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been tossed even from its first Re∣formation
from Popery. It pleased our Gracious
God, at, and by the late Revolution, to bless us
with a full and compleat Restitution, and that by
the Claim of Right, and the Acts of Parliament
following; <HI>Viz.</HI> The 5th Act of the Parliament
1690, entituled, <HI>An Act for ratifying the Confession
of Faith, and settling presbyterian Church Govern∣ment;</HI>
Whereby Presbyterian Church Government
is establish'd, ratify'd and confirm'd, as the only
Government of Christ's Church within this King∣dom,
rescending, annulling, and making void all
Acts of Parliament, Statutes and Ordinances in the
Contrary; allowing and declaring the general
Meeting, and the Representatives of the Ministers
and Elders, in whole Hands the Exercise of the
Church Government is establish'd, to have Power
to try and purge out all insufficient, negligent,
scandalous and erroneous Ministers, by due Course
of Ecclesiastical Process and Censures; and like∣wise
to redress all other Church Disorders. By
which Act it is evident, that Presbyterian Church
Government being thus Establish'd, the Ministers
and Elders of this Church have all the Powers
committed by your Lord and Master, to his Mi∣nisters
and Officers, to watch over his Flock, and
to guard it against all Usurpers and Intruders.
<HI>2dly,</HI> By the 23d Act of Parliament 1693, entitl'd,
<HI>An Act for settling the Quiet and Peace of the Church;</HI>
whereby it is expresly Statute and Ordain'd, That
no Person be admitted, or continued to be a Mini∣ster,
or Preach within this Church, unless he first
take and subscribe the Oath of Allegiance and
Assurance, and also subscribe the Confession of
Faith as the Confession of his Faith: As likewise,
<PB N="248" REF="259"/>
that he Owns and Acknowledges Presbyterian
Church Government to be the only Government
of this Church. And further, That he observe
the Uniformity of Worship, and of the Admini∣stration
of all publick Ordinances, as the same are
at present performed, and allowed within this
Church; and that no Minister or Preacher be ad∣mitted
or continued, unless he subscribes to observe
and do actually see observed the aforesaid Uni∣formity.
<HI>3dly,</HI> By the 22d Act of the Parliament
1695, entitled, <HI>An Act against intruding into Churches,
without a legal Call and Admission thereto.</HI> By which
Act is it Statute and declar'd, That whosoever shall
intrude themselves into any Church, or shall exer∣cise
any Part of the Ministerial Function within
any Parish, without an Orderly Call from the
Heretors and Eldership, and legal Admission from
the Presbytery of the Bounds, shall be removed,
and also incapable for the Space mention'd in the
Act. And <HI>4thly.</HI> by the third Adt of the Parliament
1702, entitled, <HI>An Act for securing the true Prote∣stant
Religion and Presbyterian Government.</HI> Whereby
the aforesaid Act 1690, is fully ratify'd; by which
Acts, and several others to that Purpose, which we
humbly presume to lay together for Your Majesty's
more full Information; We with all submission,
conceive that Presbyterian Church Government is
as fully settled and secured as could be devised;
and as the Worship, Discipline, and Government
of this Church were complied with, and submitted
to without any alteration in all Time, since the
Reformation, when Presbyterian Government was
establish'd by Law, so there is no Reason to doubt
but the same chearful and universal Compliance
had been given thereto, at, and ever since the late
happy Revolution, if it had not been for that wo∣ful
Seed of Disaffection to the Revolution, and
Your Majesty's Government, as thereby establish'd,
<PB N="249" REF="260"/>
and which indeed has been the Principal, if not
the only Cause of these few Prosecutions, that oc∣casion'd
so loud and unjust a Clamour.</P>
<P>But that Your Majesty may further be satisfied
of the Injustce of these Calumnies, wherewith we
are reproach'd for excessive Rigour, we cannot but
lay before Your Majesty this pregnant Instance of
our Moderation; That since our late Establishment,
there have been taken in and continu'd Hundreds
of Dissenting Ministers upon the easiest Terms;
and we are further assur'd, that when any just
Trial shall be made, we shall ever be found in∣clin'd
to all that Christian Tenderness that can be
expected from such as fear God, and love our Lord
Jesus Christ, in Sincerity; Your Majesty then, by
what is here humbly represented may plainly per∣ceive
what Security we have had for our present
Settlement before the Union; but then, in order
to the Union, and for the facilitating thereof, we
have the Sixth Act of the Parliament 1707, In∣titled,
<HI>Act for securing the Protestant Religion and
Presbyterian Government,</HI> whereby the Hail Acts
above set down are ratify'd and approven, and
Your Majesty furder with Advice and Consent of
the Estates of Parliament, expresly provides and
declares, That the foresaid true Protestant Reli∣gion
contained in the above mention'd Confession
of Faith, with the Form and Purity of Worship
presently in use within that Church and its <HI>Presby∣terian</HI>
Church Government and Discipline, all esta∣blished
by the aforesaid Acts of Parliament, pur∣suant
to the Claim of Right, shall remain and con∣tinue,
unalterable, and that the laid <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Government shall be the only Government of the
Church within the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and fur∣der
after the decease of Your Majesty (whom God
long preserve) the Sovereign succeeding, shall in
all time coming at his or her Accession to the
<PB N="250" REF="261"/>
Crown, swear and subscribe, That they win <HI>invio∣lably</HI>
maintain and preserve the aforesaid Settle∣ment
of the True Protestant Religion, with the
Government, Worship, Discipline, Rights, and
Priviledges of this Church above by Law Esta∣blish'd;
And it is furder Statute and Ordained,
That this Act of Parliament, with the Establish∣ment
therein contained, shall be held and observed
in all time coming, as a Fundamental and Essen∣tial
Condition of any Treaty of Union, to be
concluded betwixt the Two Kingdoms, without
any Alteration thereof, or Derogation thereto in
any Sort whatsoever; as also, that this Act of
Parliament and Settlement therein contain'd, shall
be incert and repeated in any Act of Parliament
that should pass for agreeing and concluding the
aforefaid Treaty of Union betwixt the Two
Kingdoms, and that the same shall therein be de∣clared
to be an Essential and Fundamental Con∣dition
of the said Treaty of Union in all time
coming: And accordingly, and that our Church
might have the Plenary Security above provided,
and that as was then plainly said, and. as the Acts
sufficiently impor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Security above-mentioned,
might be stated and established in a manner even
beyond the reach of Parliament. In both Acts
of Parliament passed in both Kingdoms, ratifying
approving the Treaty of Union, the aforesaid Act
for securing the Protestant Religon and <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Church Government, is expresly incert and is there∣by
Statute and Ordained, That this Act with the
Establishment therein contained, shall be held and
observed in all Time coming, as a Fundamental
and Essential Condition of the aforesaid Treaty of
Union, without any Alteration thereof, or Dero∣gation
thereto in any Sort for ever.</P>
<P>This being our great and plenary Security in
Law, that we have for our present Church Govern∣ment
<PB N="251" REF="262"/>
and Establishment, and we being in Danger
on the other Hand of Alterations and Innova∣tions
intended by the aforesaid Bill, depending
before the Honourable House of Commons, wherein
beside the hard Reflections contained in the Pre∣face,
it is propos'd to be Enabled, That <HI>Episcopal
Dissenters</HI> shall have Liberty to meet and assemble
for the Exercise of Divine Worship in their own
manner, and to use in their Congregations the
Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> without any
Disturbance, and that for qualifying such Pastors
<HI>Episcopal</HI> Orders, and presenting Letters of their
Orders to the Justice of the Peace shall be suffi∣cient,
and that no Person or Persons, shall incur
any Penalty whatsoever, upon his or her Resort∣ing
to the said <HI>Episcopal Meeting,</HI> and that it shall
be Free and Lawful, for all the Subjects in
that Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> to assem∣ble
and meet for Divine Service without any Dis∣turbance,
and to settle their Congregations where
they think fit, and for the <HI>Episcopal Ministers,</HI> not
only to pray and preach in their Congregations,
but to administer the Sacraments, and may with∣out
incurring any Pain or Penalty whatsoever, or
without any other Caveat, That appears for their
Doctrine, save that they shall not deny in their
preaching or writing of the Doctrine of the Blessed
Trinity, and withal that the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Clergy,
are still allowed to inflict Ecclesiastical Censures
upon those of their own Communion, which plain∣ly
imports an exemption from all, who shall
disown their Communion.</P>
<P>We cannot but in the first place express our
astonishing Surprize, and deep Affliction, to hear
of such Bill offered for such a large, and almost
boundless Toleration, not only threatning the
Overthrow of this CHURCH, but giving a large
Licence, almost to all Errors and Blasphemies;
<PB N="252" REF="263"/>
throwing up all good Discipline to the Dishonour
of God, and the Scandal and Ruin of the true
Christian Religion, and the infallible Disturbance
of the Quiet, and to the Confusion of this Church
and Nation, And therefore in the next Place, we
do with all Humility, but with the greatest Ear∣nestness
beseech, nay obtest Your Majesty by the
same Mercy of GOD that restored this Church,
and raised Your Majesty to the Throne, to inter∣pose
for the Relief of this Church, and the Main∣tenance
of the present Establishment, against such
a manifest and ruining Encroachment, in such
manner, as in your Royal Wisdom and Justice
You shall think needful.</P>
<P>That the Gracious GOD, may ever guide your
Majesty with his Councils, till after a long and
happy Reign upon Earth, he crowns you with
Glory in Heaven, shall the be the Earnest Prayen
<Q><P>May it please your Majesty, Your Majesty's most Faithful,
Obedient, and most Humble Servants and Subjects.</P>
<P>The Ministers, and Elders, Commissioners, of the late Gene∣ral
Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Sic in our Name, and at our Appointment, by
Sic Subscribitur, William Mitchel, <HI>Moderator.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>This Representation was presented to the
Qpeen by the same three Ministers above-Mentioned who presented the Petition to the
House, being introduced to Her Majesty by
the Earl of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> Secretary of State,
they had a very Gracious Reception by Her
Majesty. But the Queen answer'd only in ge∣neral
Terms, <HI>That She should take the Church
of</HI> Scotland <HI>always into Her Protection; that
She was sensible of their Dutiful Behaviour,
and was concern'd for their Peace and Well∣fare;
that the present Affair was before the
Parliament; that she did not usually concern
<PB N="253" REF="264" MS="y"/>
Herself to interpose while any Bill was depen∣ding
in the Houses, but that, when it came before
Her, She should act as She thought most for the
good of</HI> Scotland: And more to this Effect.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Bill pass'd the
Lower-House: There had been a Motion
made in the House to oblige the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
tolerated by this Bill, to take the Oaths of
Alleigance and Abjuration; but it was alleg'd,
That many of the <HI>Presbytertan</HI> Ministers de∣clin'd
the said <HI>Abjuration;</HI> and it would be
hard to put the Episcopal People to take any
more Oaths than the Establish'd Church
took: This the House observing, let the Bill
pass, and allow'd the Episcopal <HI>Dissenters</HI> to
have their Meetings and their Liberty, with∣out
taking any Oaths at all.</P>
<P>But it went not thorough the House of
Lords so, for the Three Ministers before
mentioned, who had Petition'd the <HI>Commons,</HI>
apply'd themselves, by Petition, to the <HI>House
of Lords,</HI> and obtain'd to be heard by <HI>Coun∣cil</HI>
against the Bill; which being done, the
Lords made two Amendments to the Bill;
<HI>First,</HI> That, in all the Episcopal Meetings
which were tollerated, the Minister should
take the Oaths to the Queen: <HI>Secondly,</HI> They
made a little Alteration in the <HI>Abjuration-Oath,</HI> to satisfie the Scruples of the <HI>Presby∣terian</HI>
Ministers, by putting out the Words
AS THE SAME, and putting instead
thereof the Word WHICH. The Reader,
in the Copy of the Act which follows, will
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>
easily see the reason of the Alteration, and
that it was no way Essential to the Oath, or
gave the least room to insinuate <HI>Jacobite</HI> Prin∣ciples
were the reason of it: But when the
Bill came down to the <HI>House of Commons,</HI>
that small Favour could not be obtain'd, and
those who were content to excuse the <HI>Jaco∣bite</HI>
Episcopal Clergy from taking the Oaths
at all, would not abate a Scrupulous, Consci∣encious
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> the Explanation of one
Word by another not in the least Essential
to the Nature, or Substance of the Oath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commons</HI> therefore agreeing to <HI>the
Lords,</HI> in their Judgment for obliging the
Episcopal Ministers to take the Oaths, yet
disagreed to the other; and the Lords gave
it up; so the Act was pass'd; the Conse∣quences
none can yet foresee.</P>
<P>The Act, as well to let my Reader see
the Particulars above, as also that they may
set it against the Act of Union, and see how
they Correspond, I have here incerted, at least
the most material Part, and is as follows:</P>

Baptisms and Marriages.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas since the Abolishing of Episcopal Govern∣ment
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> those of the Episcopal Perswasion
there nave been frequently Disturbed and Interrupted in their

<P>And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid.
That every Minister and Preacher, as well in the Established

Pray in express Words for Her most Sacred Majesty
Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and the most Excellent Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> Elect∣ress
and Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Hanover,</HI> while living, and
all the Royal Family: And every such Minister or Preacher

Act is herein before directed; and for the Second Offence
every Minister of the Established Church in that Part of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> being thereof Convicted by
<PB N="260" REF="271"/>

Three Years.</P>
<P>Provided always, That no Minister or Preacher Offending
herein, shall suffer such Penalties, or either of them, unless
he be Prosecuted for the same within the Space of Two
Months after the Offence is Committed.</P>
<P>This Bill needs no Comment; the Histo∣ry
of the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Pass∣ing
it, is like, for many Years, to be the Ex∣planation,
both of the Act, and of the Design
of the Party that push'd it on.</P>
<P>But they are not to be expected to stop
here: The, next Step we find them taking,
strikes at the Root of the <HI>Presbyterian Settle∣ment</HI>
itself, and aims at the Planting <HI>Episcopacy</HI>
itself in the very Parish-Churches of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
this is by restoring the Right of Patronage
in <HI>Scotland:</HI> It may be needful to speak a
Word or two to this very briefly.</P>
<P>The Right of Patronage, or presenting
Ministers to Parishes, as it was Originally
<HI>Popish,</HI> so it was demolish'd with <HI>Popery</HI> at
the first Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the People
claiming a Scriptural Right for Choosing and
Calling their own Ministers. When <HI>Presby∣tery</HI>
was next put down at the Restoration
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II and <HI>Episcopacy</HI> erected,
this Popish Claim, tho' methodized after the
<PB N="261" REF="272"/>
Protestant Manner, was re-assumed; But in
the Year 90, when <HI>Episcopacy</HI> being abolish'd,
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church was establish'd; the
Right of <HI>Patronages,</HI> as inconsistent with the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principle, was also taken away,
and the People restor'd to the Antient Right,
authorised from in the Scriptures, of Choosing
and Calling their own Ministers; and this is
allow'd to be a Fundamental Principle of the
<HI>Presbyterians,</HI> that the People are empower'd
to call their Ministers, and is exprese'd in the
<HI>Confession of the Faith</HI> of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
as it is now profess'd by the <HI>Presbyte∣rian</HI>
Church, made part of the Act of Parlia∣ment
1st <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary, Anno</HI> 1690, en∣tituled,
<HI>Act establishing the</HI> Protestant <HI>Reli∣gion
and the</HI> Presbyterian <HI>Church Govern∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, the Party, restless
to get the Churches and Stipends into their
Hands, push'd on the Design, and having
concerted their Measures, apply themselves
to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and ob∣tain'd
leave, by Motion, to bring in a Bill
for <HI>Restoring the Patronages</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI>
which Bill being depending at the Writing
of these Sheets, the Issue, God willing, shall
either be added as an Appendix to this Work,
or be reserv'd for a farther Account.</P>
<P>At the same time with this they, believing
the Game all their own, move for a Bill to be
brought in to Repeal the Act in <HI>Scotland,</HI> en-entituled,
<PB N="262" REF="273"/>
<HI>Act discharging the yule Vacance;</HI>
that is to Revive the Observation of <HI>Christmas</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which the People there were
not at all acquainted with.</P>
<P>After these Things it is not to be wonder'd
at, if they push at the Whole Constitution,
both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State;</HI> nor is it doubted
but that this is in their Design: How far
they shall be permitted to go on Godly only
knows.</P>
<P>Mean time, <HI>Reciting the whole Substance of
the Abjuration itself,</HI> yet withal, the Commis∣sion
of the Assembly of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
being to meet, and being exceedingly
alarm'd at these Proceedings, resolv'd to make
a second Address to Her Majesty.</P>
<P>This Address contained a Declaration of
the Untainted Loyalty of the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and their steady adherence to Her
Majesty's <HI>Interest,</HI> and to Her <HI>Personal Right,</HI>
against the <HI>Pretender</HI> and all his <HI>Adherents;</HI>
and their Resolutions to continue it, as well
to Her Majesty, as to the <HI>Protestant Succes∣sion
in the Line;</HI> humbly representing to
Her Majesty, That tho' some of their Bre∣thren
might have some Scruples relating to
the Conditions and Limitations of the <HI>Suc∣cessor,</HI>
which had occasion'd their earnest
Desire to have the same regulated, so as that
they might have no Obstruction in the Way
of their taking it; and that they might with
all Freedom, manifest their readiness to give
<PB N="263" REF="274"/>
such assurances of their <HI>Loyalty</HI> as the Law
directs, yet their worst Enemies could take
no Advantage of them to suggest, thereby,
their being <HI>Disloyal</HI> to Her Majesty, or <HI>Un∣steady</HI>
in the said <HI>Succession,</HI> as it respected
the Illustrious House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> since the
small Alteration they desired in their Appli∣cation
to the Parliament, had it been grant∣ed,
would not have given the least Shaddow
to the Suggestion of their Favouring the
<HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>The Petition being presented to Her Ma∣jesty
by the same Ministers as before, was
receiv'd very Graciously, and Her Majesty
was pleas'd to Express Her Satisfaction in
the <HI>Loyalty</HI> of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in a
Manner very Obliging.</P>
<P>But this could give no Relief to the People
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Scruples could receive no
Satisfaction, or the Law any Relaxation from
the favourable Answer given by the Queen,
the Act being pass'd as above.</P>
<P>But Things ended not here; this Session
was yet more fatal to the Interest of the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church; and the <HI>High-Party</HI>
went on to get all the Hardships put upon
the Establish'd Church, which they could
possibly obtain in a Term of Law.</P>
<P>The next Step, was the Act mentioned
before, to <HI>Restore the Right of Patronages,
or Presentation of Ministers to the Parish
Churches.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="275"/>
That this was directly Inconsistent with
the Principle of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> I need not
spend Time to enlarge on, they having, on
several Occasions, declar'd the Right of
Nameing, Choosing, and Collating to Bene∣fices,
to be in the several Persons Appointed,
and Chosen for that Purpose. But the Le∣gal
Right of Presentation, and the Claim
which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has, by So∣lemn
Stipulation of the <HI>Union,</HI> as well as
by other Acts of Parliament, to the Presen∣tation
of their Ministers, being the present
Subject of Debate, I cannot do a greater piece
of Service here, in order to Open the Eyes of
our People who, tho' Friends to the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are wholly Ignorant in this
Case, than by stateing the said Right from
the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> even in the same Man∣ner
as it was done before the Parliament,
so that Posterity may see, over the Belly of
what Right these Things were attempted,
and what Injury the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> re∣ceive
in them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lay-Patronages</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> are so far
from being the Antient Constitution, that
there's scarce a Country in <HI>Christendom</HI> where∣ever
they had so little Footing; so that if
the <HI>Scotch</HI> Patrons were put to justify their
Title by the old Maxim of the Canonists,</P>
<P>Patronum faciunt dos, aedificatio, fundus,
<PB N="265" REF="276"/>
they would make but a very indifferent Plea
of it; for nothing is plainer in their Law,
than that the Tythes were the Patrimony of
that Church, as appears by <HI>Act</HI> 10. <HI>Parl.</HI> 1.
<HI>James</HI> IV. held in 1567, and by many other
Acts. It is likewise known to every one
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that Tythes were settled by the
Legislature, and that such Endowments as
have, at any Time, been made from the
Rents of the Crown, requir'd the Consent
of Parliament to make them good; that their
Princes could alienate nothing belonging to
the <HI>Crown</HI> without their Consent. And as
to the Pope's <HI>Canon-Law,</HI> from whence <HI>Pa∣tronages</HI>
proceded, it never obtain'd so far in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as to be much regarded. This is evi∣dent
from many of their Laws, which forbid
their being govern'd by any other, and from
the Pragmatical Sanctions betwixt the Popes
and the Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were always
as inflexible in this Matter, if not more,
than the Kings of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But be that how it will; when the Pope's
Authority was abrogated, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Act
of Parliament, in 1560, all Jurisdiction de∣riv'd
from him fell with it, and his <HI>Canon-Law</HI>
among the rest, except what part of it
the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> retain'd for its own
Equity, and its Agreeableness to their <HI>Con∣stitution,</HI>
which was follow'd in <HI>Comissar</HI>'s <HI>Courts,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from
<PB N="266" REF="277"/>
the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> declar'd
against <HI>Lay-Patronages,</HI> and <HI>Presentations.</HI>
This appears from the first Book of Disci∣pline,
drawn up by Order of the Govern∣ment,
and agreed to in the Privy-Council,
<HI>January</HI> 17. 1560, where, in the Fourth
Head, <HI>Concerning the lawful Election of Mi∣nisters,</HI>
the Power of Election is lodg'd in the
Parishoners; and in case they delay'd it 40
Days, the <HI>Presentation</HI> was to be in the <HI>Su∣perintendant</HI>
and his <HI>Council, viz.</HI> the Mini∣sters
and Elders of his Province.</P>
<P>In the first General Assembly of the Re∣formed
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> held the 20th of
<HI>December</HI> 1560, about four Months after
the Pope's Authority was abolish'd, it was
enacted, the 27th of the said Month, <HI>That the
Election of Ministers should be in the Publick
Church, by the People, and that Notice should
be given of it the</HI> Sunday <HI>preceeding.</HI> It
was the same as to the Election of <HI>Superinten∣dants,</HI>
as may be seen by the Form of it pre∣fix'd
to our Old Psalm Books, and in the first
Book of Discipline, under the Head <HI>of the
Election of Superintendants;</HI> and the Church
requir'd, that the <HI>Ministers,</HI> the <HI>Poor,</HI> and
the <HI>Schools,</HI> should be provided for out of the
Tythes which were the Patrimony of the
Kirk, as appears by the sixth Head of the first
Book of Discipline, under the Title of <HI>The
Rents and Patrimony of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>In the 3d <HI>Sess.</HI> of the 4th General Assem∣bly
<PB N="267" REF="278"/>
held at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was enacted, <HI>Dec.</HI>
27. 1562. <HI>That the Presentation of Ministers
should be in the People.</HI> Thus Matters were
stated at Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Arrival from <HI>France,
Aug.</HI> 19, 1561. and the 25th of that Month
her Majesty declar'd, by Proclamation, That
no-body, on pain of Death, should attempt
Privately, or Publickly, to make an <HI>Alteration
or Innovation in the State</HI> of Religion which
she found Publickly and Universally stand∣ing
at her Arrival; and she promis'd not to
attempt any thing against it herself, but to
settle all things with the Consent of the
States. This Promise was kept no otherwise
than as Popish Princes use to do with their
Protestant Subjects; for that she and her
Courtiers were unwilling to part with the
Patronages and Patrimony of the Church
which they had possess'd themselves of on
the Abrogation of Popery, insomuch that the
poor Ministers had little else to maintain
them but the Benevolence of their Hearers;
and with much ado, after many Petitions,
they obtain'd a third of the Tythes, which
was but indifferently paid, so little real de∣pendance
had they on Lay-Patrons.</P>
<P>The Church being under these Pressures,
she was willing to comply as far as she could
in Conscience, in order to obtain what far∣ther
Reformation was wanting, and a Redress
of her Grievances. Therefore she agreed, in
the Assembly of 1565, that Her Majesty, or
<PB N="268" REF="279"/>
any other Patron, might present to Vacant
Benefices but on Condition that they presen∣ted
qualify'd Persons, and subjected them to
the Examination of the Kirk, <HI>who had the
Right of Collation to the Cure, if the Patron
had the Presentation to the Benefice;</HI> other∣wise,
say they, the Patrons might obtrude
such Persons as they pleas'd upon them.
And thus, as they complain in the 6th Head
of the first Book of Discipline, <HI>the Papistical
Tyranny should be only chang'd into that of
the Lord and Laird;</HI> therefore they requir'd,
that the Kirk might be restored to her Liber∣ty
that she had been cruelly spoil'd of by the
<HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>In the second Book of Discipline, agreed
on by the General Assembly of 1578, regi∣ster'd
by that of 1581, and order'd to be
subscrib'd by all Ministers, they declare
themselves, Chap. 12. thus:</P>
<P>The Liberty of the Election of Persons call'd
to Ecclesiastical Functions, and observ'd with∣out
Interruption, so long as the Kirk was not
corrupted by Antichrist, we desire to be restored
and retain'd within this Realm, so that none
be intruded upon any Congregation, either by
the Prince, or any inferior Person, without
lawful Election, and the Assent of the People
over whom the Person is plac'd, as the Practice
of the Apostolical and Primitive Kirk and good
Order craves; and because this Order which
God's Word craves, cannot stand with Patro∣nages
<PB N="269" REF="280"/>
and Presentations to Benefices, used in
the Pope's Kirk, we desire all them that truly
fear God, earnestly to consider, that for as much
as the Names of <HI>Patronages</HI> and <HI>Benefices,</HI>
together with the Effects thereof, have <HI>flow'd
from the Pope, and the Corruption of the</HI>
Canon-Law <HI>only,</HI> in so far as thereby any
Person was intruded, or placed over Kirks,
having <HI>Curam Animarum:</HI> And forasmuch
as that manner of Proceeding hath no ground
in the Word of God, but is contrary to the same,
and to the said Liberty of Election, they ought
not now to have place in this Light of <HI>Re∣formation.</HI>
But as to these <HI>Patronages</HI> that
have not <HI>Curam Animarum,</HI> as <HI>Chaplain∣ries,
Prebendaries,</HI> &amp;c. sounded upon Tempo∣ral
Lands, Annuals, and such like, they may
be reserv'd to the Antient Patrons to dispose
of to <HI>Scholars</HI> and <HI>Bursars,</HI> according to Act
of Parliament.</P>
<P>This was the Sense of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
at the <HI>Reformation.</HI> We come next to
shew how the matter stood in Law. The
Courtiers, tho' unwilling to part with the
<HI>Patronages,</HI> agreed, however, that the Power
of <HI>Patrons</HI> should be restrain'd. Thus, by
the 7th Act of the first Parliament of King
<HI>James</HI> VI. held <HI>Anno</HI> 1567, it was Enacted,
<HI>That the Examination and Admission of Min∣nisters
be only in the Power of the Kirk;</HI> and
that the <HI>Patron</HI> Present a qualify'd Person
within six Months (after the Decease of the
<PB N="270" REF="281"/>
former Incumbent comes to his Knowledge)
to the <HI>Superintendant</HI> or others, having the
Commission of the Kirk, otherwise the Kirk
to have Power to dispose of the same to a
qualified Person. The Qualifications requi∣red
were, That he should agree with the
<HI>Church</HI> in Doctrine, and the Administration
of the Sacraments, according to the <HI>Confession
of Faith,</HI> as appears by Act 6. Parliament 1.
<HI>James</HI> VI. The Act 46. Parliament 3. of
that same Prince, enjoyns, That the <HI>Minister</HI>
should be under the Discipline of the <HI>Kirk,</HI>
partake with her in the Sacraments, and
Subscribe the Articles of Religion, and give
his Oath for acknowledging the King and his
Authority. And by Parliament 6. Act 68.
<HI>James</HI> VI. they who refuse to Communi∣cate
in the Sacraments, as Administred in the
Kirk, according to the <HI>Confession</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> or
contradict the said <HI>Confession,</HI> are declar'd to
be no Members of the Kirk, so long as they
do so, and by the 69th Act of that same
Parliament 'tis declar'd, <HI>That there be no
other Jurisdiction Ecclesiastick acknowledg'd
within this Realm, than that which is, and
shall be within the same Kirk, or that flows
therefrom.</HI> It is here likewise proper to ob∣serve
That by the above-mention'd Act of
1567, in case of a Failure, by the <HI>Superin∣tendant,</HI>
or <HI>Commissioner</HI> of the Kirk to ad∣mit
a qualify'd Person, presented by the
<HI>Patron,</HI> there lay an Appeal to the <HI>Superin∣tendant,</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="282"/>
and <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Province; and
if they refus'd to admit the qualify'd Person,
an Appeal was to be made to the General
Assembly, whose Determination was to be
Decisive.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this Restriction on
Patrons, many Abuses resulted from the
Patronages by Contracts betwixt the Patrons
and some Ministers, who were Guilty of di∣lapidating
the Rents of the Benefices (without
regard how their Successors shou'd live
after them) for the sake of present Profit.
And by the same Method, Benefices were
conferr'd upon unqualify'd Persons, both by
the King and other Lay-Patrons, against
which a Remedy was provided by the 101st
and 102d Acts of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 7th
Parliament which met <HI>October</HI> 24. 1581.</P>
<P>A further Remedy was provided by the
116th Act of his 12th Parliament, which
met <HI>June</HI> 5. 1592. by which the Collation and
Deprivation of Ministers was lodg'd in the
Church, <HI>As a Privilege granted by God to
her Spiritual Office - bearers, wherein her
General Assemblies were also Ratify'd and
Approv'd, with all her Privileges, Liberties,
and Immunities and Freedoms given and
granted by his Highness, his Regents in
his Name, or any of his Predecessors to the
true and Holy Kirk, presently Establish'd with∣in
this Realm; and among other Privileges,
all Presentations to Benefices were to be di∣rected
<PB N="272" REF="283"/>
to the Presbyteries, with a full Power
of Collation:</HI> And by the 117th Act, the
Church had a Power of presenting <HI>Jure De∣voluto,</HI>
if the Patron did not present a quali∣fy'd
Person after a Vacancy of six Months:
But a Reserve being made in the 116th Act,
that they should receive and admit any qua∣lify'd
Person presented by his Majesty, or Lay-Patrons,
the Abuse continued, and Ministers
were depriv'd of their Benefices by several
Patrons, to prevent which, the 169th Act
of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 13th Parliament was
made.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these Provisions against
the Abuse of Patronages, the General Assem∣bly
of 1596 finding, that by those Presen∣tations
many Persons were forciby thrust
into the Ministry, and upon Congregations,
whose Conduct shew'd they were never call'd
of God, the Assembly provided, that none
shou'd seek Presentations to Benefices, <HI>with∣out
Advice of the Presbytery, in whose Bounds
they lay,</HI> on pain of being repell'd, as <HI>Rei Am∣bitus,</HI>
and they desired, that such as were
Guilty of dilapidating Benefices, or of di∣mitting
them for Favour or Money, so as
they become Lay-Patronages, might be pu∣nish'd
as Dilapidators.</P>
<P>Thus these Lay <HI>Patronages</HI> continued a
Subject of Controversy betwixt Lay-Patrons
and the Church, and occasioned many Abuses
and much Clamour by the Courtiers against
<PB N="273" REF="284"/>
her, but they cou'd not fully accomplish their
Design, till after the Union of the Crowns,
when the Court being at a distance from
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and open to the constant Sollicita∣tion
of Men of other Principles, the State of
Bishops was establish'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the
2d Act of King <HI>James</HI> VIth's 18th Parliam.
which met <HI>July</HI> 9. 1696, after which the
Power of <HI>Presentation</HI> was lodg'd in the
Archbishops and Bishops; but the <HI>Patrons,</HI>
by their Interest in Parliament, had the Luck
to keep their <HI>Patronages</HI> on Foot under se∣veral
Restrictions, which did not remove the
Evil that, from the Beginning, was com∣plain'd
of, and as an immediate and obvious
Consequence of it, <HI>Simony,</HI> which is a direct
Bargain betwixt the <HI>Patron</HI> and the <HI>Mini∣ster</HI>
to be presented, for obtaining a Spiritual
Charge in the <HI>Church,</HI> was too plainly Tole∣rated,
to the great <HI>Scandal</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and
manifest <HI>Decay</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Learning;</HI> for
the <HI>Patrons,</HI> by these <HI>Simoniacal</HI> Contracts,
inverted the Tythes to their own private
Use, and no Minister was Presented, till he
had given a Lease to his <HI>Patron</HI> of the Ty∣thes
of his Parish, in Consideration of a poor
Aliment to himself and his Family: An
Abuse which ought certainly to Affect all
those who are truly Religious, either in the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This occasion'd so many Abuses in <HI>Presen∣ting</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="285"/>
of <HI>Ministers,</HI> and fill'd the <HI>Church</HI> so
full of <HI>unqualify'd Persons,</HI> that it was one
of the principal Causes of Complaint which
brought on the <HI>Civil-War,</HI> and occasioned
the Abolition of <HI>Prelacy</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as may
be seen by the Acts of Assembly, and Papers
of State, from 1638 to 1641.</P>
<P><HI>Presbytery</HI> being restor'd in a Parliament
where the King was present, the Affair of
<HI>Patronage</HI> was accommodated betwixt the
King and the <HI>Church,</HI> thus: Upon a Petition
from the Assembly, for the <HI>better providing
of vacant Churches in his Majesty's Presenta∣tion
with qualify'd Ministers,</HI> his Majesty
agreed, That upon sending him a List of six
Persons by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> he wou'd pre∣sent
one of them, as appears by his Declara∣tion,
Sign'd with his own Hand at <HI>White∣hall,
Jan.</HI> 3. 1642, and Register'd in the Books
of the Assembly, the 3d of <HI>August</HI> following;
and, by Act an of the Assembly of the same
Date, it appears that the <HI>Patronages</HI> formerly
belonging to the Bishops were vested in the
<HI>Presbytertes,</HI> by Act of Parliament, and that
the like Method of the <HI>Presbyteries</HI> sending
a List of <HI>qualify'd Persons</HI> to other <HI>Lay-Pa∣trons,</HI>
as to his Majesty was also agreed
upon.</P>
<P>But in the Assembly of 1643, they Peti∣tioned
his Majesty, That, considering the
Difficulty of obtaining a List of Six Well-qualify'd
Persons for every vacant Church in
<PB N="275" REF="286"/>
his Majesty's Presentation, he wou'd accept
a List of Three, and of any one qualify'd
Person, who spoke <HI>Irish,</HI> for a Vacant Church
in the <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
<P>Matters continued thus till 1649, that
all these Restrictions not being found suffi∣cient
against the Abuses of <HI>Lay - Patrons,</HI>
they were totally abolish'd by Act of Par∣liament.</P>
<P><HI>Episcopacy</HI> and <HI>Patronages</HI> were restored by
Acts of Parliament in King <HI>Charles</HI> IId's
Reign, from 1662, and downwards. But
when the meeting of the Estates of <HI>Scotland</HI>
was call'd expresly in 1689, for securing the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, and the ancient Laws
and Liberties of the Kingdom, to the Lega∣lity
of which meeting, the Bishops did also
subscribe, as appears by the 2d Act of that
Meeting; and by the 13th Act, the Estates
did claim, among other Things, as appears by
their Declaration of Right, <HI>That</HI> Prelacy,
<HI>and the Superiority of any Office in the Church
above</HI> Presbyters, <HI>is, and has been, a great
and insupportable Grievance and Trouble to
this Nation, and contrary to the Inclination of
the Generality of the People, ever since the
Reformation, (they having reform'd from</HI> Po∣pery
<HI>by</HI> Presbyters) <HI>and therefore ought to
be abolishd'd.</HI></P>
<P>Pursuant to the above-mention'd Article
of the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI> and the Design of turn∣ing
<PB N="276" REF="287"/>
the Meeting of Estates into a Parliament,
<HI>Prelacy</HI> was abolish'd by the Third Act, Sess.
1. of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary, July</HI> 22.
1689, and still, pursuant to the same Article,
the Parliament did, by Act 2d. Sess. 2. <HI>April</HI>
25. 1690, restore the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers
who were thrust from their Churches since
<HI>January</HI> 1. 1461. And in the 5th Act of
the same Sestion, after reciting the above-mention'd
Article of the Claim of Right, as
the Foundation of their Proceedings; and re∣citing
likewise the last mention'd Act for abo∣lishing
<HI>Prelacy,</HI> they proceed to settle <HI>Presby∣terian</HI>
Church-Government upon the Foot
of the Act of 1592, and do ratify and revive
the said Act <HI>in the whole Heads thereof,</HI> ex∣cept
that part of it, relating to <HI>Patronages,</HI>
which, they declare, <HI>is hereafter to be taken
into Consideration.</HI> And, pursuant to this Re∣servation,
by the 23d Act of that same Par∣liamen,
<HI>July</HI> 19, 1690, they take away <HI>the
Patrons Power of Presentation:</HI> All which
Acts were frequently ratify'd, not only by
King <HI>William,</HI> but by Her present Maje∣sty,
since Her happy Accession to the
Crown.</P>
<P>The Act which most immediately relates
to the <HI>Patronages</HI> in debate, is the 6th Act
of Her Majesty's Parliament, <HI>for Securing the
Protestant Religion and</HI> Presbyterian <HI>Church-Government,</HI>
pass'd <HI>Jan.</HI> 16. 1707, wherein
Her Majesty, with the Advice and Consent
<PB N="277" REF="288"/>
of the Estates of Parliament, <HI>ratifies, approves,
and</HI> FOR EVER CONFIRMS the 5th Act
of the 1st Parliament of King <HI>William</HI> and
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> entituled, <HI>An Act ratifying the
Confession of Faith, and settling</HI> Presbyterian
<HI>Church-Government,</HI> WITH THE HAIL
OTHER ACTS OF PARLIAMENT RE∣LATING
THERETO, IN PROSECU∣TION
OF THE DECLARATION OF
ESTATES OF THIS KINGDOM, CON∣TAINING
THE CLAIM OF RIGHT.
So that this 23d Act of Parliament, concern∣ing
<HI>Patronages,</HI> being made pursuant to the
above-mention'd Article of the <HI>Claim of Right,</HI>
and for compleating the Settlement men∣tion'd
in the said 5th Act for settling <HI>Presby∣terian</HI>
Church-Government in the Terms of
it, is very plainly confirm'd by the said 6th
Act of Her Majesty's Parliament, 1707,
which is made, and expresly declar'd to be
a Fundamental and Essential Condition of
the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>By this Act for abolishing <HI>Patronages,</HI> no∣thing
but the Right of <HI>Presentation</HI> is taken
from the <HI>Patrons,</HI> in order to settle the Call
of Ministers upon the Foot of a Free Aposto∣lical
Election, which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
has always contended for, and this the <HI>Pa∣trons</HI>
have so little cause to complain of, that
their <HI>Civil-Right</HI> is put in a better Condition
than befor; for now they have a Right to
<PB N="278" REF="289"/>
the Tythes, and are in a manner made Ti∣tulars;
whereas, so long as they continued
only <HI>Patrons,</HI> they were under a Necessity
to make Contracts with the Ministers they
presented, about the Right of Tythes, which
now they need not do, since they themselves
are the Titulars, and the Ministers only
Stipendaries. This has effectually put a stop
to <HI>Simoniacal</HI> Contracts, which have ever been
the Abhorrence of all Christian Churches,
and of none more than the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
from whom, in this Matter, they differ
not in Principle, as may be seen in Her 40th
Canon, containing a Oath which all Intrants
are obliged to take at their Institution into
Benefices, <HI>viz. That they have made no</HI> Si∣moniacal
<HI>Payment, Contract, or Promise, di∣rectly
or indirectly, by themselves, or by any
Person or Persons whatsoever, for, or con∣cerning
the procuring and obtaining of this
Ecclesiastical Dignity, Place, Preferment,
Office, or Living, nor will, at any Time
hereafter, perform, or satisfy any such kind
of Payment, Contract, or Promise, made by
any other without their Knowledge and Con∣sent.</HI></P>
<P>It must be own'd, That this is a very strict
Oath; but we are not to wonder, that the
Church of <HI>England</HI> took such Precautions in
a Matter of this Importance, since, in the
Preamble to the Canon, She justly says, <HI>That</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="290"/>
Simony <HI>is a detestable Sin, and that the Buy∣ing
and Selling of Spiritual and Ecclesiastical
Functions, Offices, Promotions, Dignities and
Livings</HI> IS EXECRABLE BEFORE
GOD.</P>
<P>We know 'tis us'd as an Argument for
restoring <HI>Lay-Patronages,</HI> that the Right of
presenting Ministers, is a Right of <HI>Property,</HI>
to which the <HI>Patrons</HI> have as good a Title
as to their Estates; and also, that there was
about 33 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling to be paid to the <HI>Patrons</HI>
for renouncing their Right of Presentation,
which has never been paid.</P>
<P>Any one may see, that these are very slight
Pretences to weaken or alter the <HI>Constitution</HI>
of a <HI>Church,</HI> so solemnly establish'd, as a Fun∣damental
and Unalterable Article of the
Union. The fair Dealing that is Essential
to the Execution of all Treaties does not ad∣mit,
that, upon such weak Pretences, there
shou'd be the least straitning of the Benefit
intended for the Quiet and Satisfaction, as
well as for the Security of the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI> No Man, soberly thinking, can
imagine that any one has that same Proper∣ty
in Presenting Ministers to Churches, as
they have in their Lands, Houses, Goods
and Chattels: Besides, the Patrons of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
as has been observ'd already, have not
the Foundation of <HI>Patronage</HI> required by
the <HI>Canon-Law.</HI> The Churches of <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="291"/>
are not endow'd by the <HI>Patrons,</HI> nor out of
any private Estate; for since the Reforma∣tion,
the State of the Provision of Ministers,
and consequently of the <HI>Patrons</HI> Claims is
very much alter'd. Ministers have their
Stipends or Allowance for serving the Cures,
out of the Tythes, which as above, is by Law
accounted the <HI>Patrimony of the Church,</HI> and
Churches are appointed to be Built and Re∣pair'd
by the Parishioners. The Ground up∣on
which the Churches are built, the Glebes
and Minister's Dwelling-Houses, are by Law
taken out of the Property of the Parish; so
that it is the Church and Parish that have
the Title of the <HI>Canon-Law</HI> to the <HI>Patro∣nage,</HI>
since it is the Parish who gave the <HI>Dos
Aedificatio,</HI> and the <HI>Fundus.</HI></P>
<P>The other Part of the Objection, that the
<HI>Patrons</HI> have not receiv'd the 33 <HI>l.</HI> for Re∣signing
their Right of Presentation can ne∣ver
be allow'd as a good Reason to restore
that Right; since the very Act did provide
for a Distress and Execution at the Suit of
the <HI>Patrons,</HI> against the Parish, if the said 33 <HI>l.</HI>
was not paid, but if this Execution has not
been made Use of by the <HI>Patrons,</HI> 'tis their
own Fault. Therefore they cannot, in
Justice, pretend to have such a Relief as a
Right to the Presentation, for that which
has been the Consequence of their own Neg∣lect.
But further, it is wrong to pretend,
<PB N="281" REF="292"/>
that there was no other Price appointed by
the said Act for the Right of Presentation,
but the 33 <HI>l.</HI> above-mention'd, since there is,
certainly, a much more valuable Considera∣tion.
The <HI>Patrons,</HI> who, before that Act,
cou'd have no Right to the Tythes, but by
Simony, which is execrable, and conse∣quently
not to be justify'd by any Colour of
Law, have, by the very Act which deprives
them of the Right of Presentation, a Title to
the Tythes with the Burden only of a fair
and honest Proviion to be settled by the
Law upon the Ministers for serving the Cure.
This the <HI>Patrons</HI> do enjoy, and have en∣joy'd
for 22 Years, and by Virtue of that
Title the Tythes have been convey'd from
Hand to Hand.</P>
<P>So that those who pretend to have <HI>Patro∣nages</HI>
restored, because of a Delicacy in Point
of Property would rob the Church of her
Tythes, which is her <HI>Patrimony,</HI> without al∣lowing
the Calling and Ordaining of <HI>Ministers</HI>
to remain as it is now establish'd, agreeable to
the most ancient Practice of the Christian
Church? They would enjoy the Purchase
and the Price too?</P>
<P>There might be many useful Observa∣tions
made from these Things; but as
the Bill is in its very <HI>Crisis,</HI> at the Writing
these Sheets, the Author cannot make such
Notes on it as might otherwise be necessary.
<PB N="282" REF="293"/>
It is sufficient here, that I have Stated the
Right of the Church <HI>Scotland:</HI> What the
Parliament may do in, or the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
suffer under the Unhappy Circumstance
above-noted, I cannot Determine here, neither
have I room in this narrow Compass to En∣large
upon it.</P>

down to their now Suppress'd and Suffering
Condition; something of the Causes, Er∣rors,
and Mistakes of their past Conduct:
How they might have acted, and how they

they expect to support their Interest as a
Body in the Nation.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Case of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in
<HI>England</HI> has so much Con∣nection
with, and Concern
in the Condition of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
however, thro' the Error
of the Times, we have not that Concert
and Understanding which our Brethren in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> that it were to be wish'd for
mutual Safety had been maintain'd; yet
it is impossible to separate them in History,
<PB N="284" REF="295"/>
or to make just Remarks on the State of the
One without taking Notice of the Other. The
same Party Oppos'd both; the same Rancor,
Rage, and Persecuting Malice, possess'd their
Enemies in both Parts, &amp; with the same View.
We come now to direct this Tract to the <HI>Dissen∣ters.</HI>
'Tis a hard Task to know how to give
Reproof, but 'tis yet a harder, and one of the
hardest Tasks in Nature to know how to re∣ceive
it. The first requires Prudence, and
Disinterested Faithfulness; the other Mo∣desty
in a vast Quantiy, Wisdom, Obedience
to Conviction, and a very great Stock of
Temper, Humility, and Self-Denial, <HI>Reprove
one that has Understanding, and he will Un∣derstand,</HI>
Prov. 19. 25. None but a Man of
Understanding is fit to receive Reproof.</P>
<P><HI>Fools</HI> hate Instruction: <HI>Children</HI> could kill
their Schoolmasters; and both abhorr their
<HI>best Friends;</HI> and we know that Reproof to
a Generation that think themselves so Wife
as this, is a most Desparate, and almost Hope∣less
Attempt. But the People concern'd must
remember the very History of their <HI>Conduct</HI>
is a kind of Reproof; and he that will faithful∣ly
relate the one, must be of course concern'd
in the other; for as the Prophet said of Old,
<HI>Thine own Iniquities reprove thee, and thy
Backslidings condemn thee.</HI></P>
<P>It is not therefore the Author of this that
takes upon him to Remark, or Animadvert
upon the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> their own History repre∣hends
their Follies we speak of; and a bare re∣lation
<PB N="285" REF="296"/>
of Fact is a full Reproof to the Parties
concern'd: Perhaps there may lie some Ob∣jections
against the Manner, and some may
complain of the Openness, the Unkindness,
the plainess of the Reproof: But this shall be
answer'd thus; there shall lie no Objection
against the Injustice, or Unreasonableness of
it: Of the Truth of Fact, the Justice of the
Consequences, and the Probabilities of the
Mischiefs here laid down, every Reader is
Judge; and the making it publick is an ap∣peal
to the World for these, and a Challenge
to Gainsayers: But as to the Seasonableness,
Openness, Kindness, Plainness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Au∣thor
thinks it in his own Breast to judge of
them, and may descend to Defend them,
when the Debates about the Truth and
Justice of them are over.</P>
<P>I presume, no <HI>Dissenter</HI> that has any just
Concern upon his Thoughts for the Interest
and Cause of the whole Body of <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> will Dispute the Foundation,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they are to be esteem'd, at this
Time, in a declining and decaying Posture.
And tho' it be a little begging the Question,
yet we choose to appeal to themselves, rather
than enter into the publick Enquiry of the
Particulars, which they ought to take for
the first Evidence, that the Author of this is
a Friend to, and really knows their Interest.</P>
<P>But that it may be understood, more perfect∣ly,
what is meant here by the Words <HI>Decaying</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="297"/>
and <HI>Declining</HI> of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the
Reader is desired to accept of the following
Explication.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is not meant, That they are <HI>decay'd
in their Numbers,</HI> or <HI>declin'd</HI> in their
Extent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor is it meant, That they are <HI>decay'd</HI>
in their Quality, Wealth, or Worldly
Circumstances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But that the <HI>Decay</HI> and <HI>Declining</HI> of the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> lies in the <HI>Decay</HI> of their <HI>In∣terest;</HI>
their <HI>Friends;</HI> their <HI>Ministry;</HI>
their <HI>General Practice,</HI> whether Reli∣gious
or Politick; their <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Una∣nimity</HI>
among themselves; their <HI>Know∣ledge</HI>
and <HI>Pursuit</HI> of their own <HI>Cause;</HI>
their <HI>Charity,</HI> largeness of <HI>Spirit,</HI> taste
of <HI>Religious Matters,</HI> and management
of Civil—and it is doubted it may
be said, a <HI>decay</HI> of their <HI>Sanctity</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI>
and even of their <HI>Morals.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>This will but too plainly appear in the
following Discourse: And if laying down
the Matter of Fact, making it self-evident in
the Particulars, and convincing in the Ge∣neral,
will not open the Eyes of those, for
whose Conviction this is written, their Blind∣ness
will not lie at the Door of any-Body
but themselves.</P>
<P>I hope, and believe, that the Principle of
<PB N="287" REF="298"/>
<HI>Dissenting</HI> from the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the
same as Ever; tho' 'tis manifest this Age
is not able to give so good an Account of it
as the last; the reason of which is manifest,
and may be sum'd up thus:</P>
<P>The last Age of <HI>Dissenters</HI> was compos'd
of those who, upon the Restoration of
the <HI>Church Discipline,</HI> and the <HI>Act of Uni∣formity,
Anno</HI> 1661, found themselves
straightned in their Consciences, as to <HI>Con∣formity,</HI>
with the Ceremonies in Worship,
and Hierarchy, or Government of the <HI>Church
of England;</HI> for it is evident, in Doctrine
they do not Dissent. Upon this, after the
Endeavours us'd on both Sides, at the <HI>Savoy</HI>
Conference, (if both Sides did endeavour)
for a Reconciliation, had prov'd fruitless, all
those Ministers who could not comply with
the Church, were turn'd out of their Li∣vings;
and finding many of the People re∣solv'd
also not to conform; the one Part
believing in their Consciences they ought
not to omit the Preaching the Gospel, <HI>as
they were Ministers;</HI> the other believing
they ought to worship God in that Way
<HI>only</HI> which they thought to be most agree∣able
to his reveal'd Will, and most Edifying
to themselves: And both Conscientiously,
and meerly Scrupling the <HI>Church Govern∣ment,
Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> they joyn'd
together, form'd separate Congregations, and
thus began to be call'd <HI>Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="299"/>
How far this Original is justifiable, whe∣ther
they are thereby become <HI>Schismaticks;</HI>
how they have been treated by, or have be∣hav'd
themselves to the Church, is no Part
of the Business of this Discourse.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Ministers</HI> were Men known over
the whole World; their general Character
was own'd even by their Enemies; gene∣rally
Speaking, they were Men of liberal
Education; had a vast Stock of Learning;
were Exemplar in Piety; Studious, Labo∣rious,
and unexceptionably Capable of Car∣rying
on the Work they were embark'd in.
We are Talking to the Reader as a <HI>Dissenter</HI>
in this, and therefore need not enter into the
Particular Characters of the Race of Men,
now gone off the Stage, whose Works, <HI>tho'
they are rested from their Labour,</HI> still fol∣low
them; and who, their Enemies being
Judges, were Men worthy of a better Lot
than they met with in this Place. How
near the present Stock, which we are now
furnish'd with, come up to those that went
before them, and how qualify'd to support
and carry on the Cause, and the Work they
left upon their Hands shall be examin'd in
its Course.</P>
<P>As were the Ministers, so, in a Proportion,
were the People; they were Conscientious,
diligent Hearers of the Word preach'd, stu∣dy'd
the best Gifts, encourag'd, but not
<PB N="289" REF="300"/>
worship'd their Ministers; they follow'd
the Substance, not the Sound of Preaching,
they understood what they Heard, and knew
how to choose their Ministers: What they
heard Preach'd, they improv'd in Practice;
their Families were little Churches, where
the Worship of God was constantly kept
up; their Children and Families were du∣ly
Instructed, and themselves, when they
came to Tryal, chearfully suffer'd Persecu∣tion
for the Integrity of their Hearts, ab∣horring
to contradict, by their Practice,
what they profess'd in Principle; or, by any
Hypocritical Compliance, to give the World
Reason to believe they had not Dissented,
but upon a sincerely examin'd and meet
Conscientious Scruple.</P>
<P>Among these, both Ministers and People,
there was a joynt Concurrence in carrying
on the Work of Religion; the First preach'd
found Doctrine without Jingle or Trifling;
they Study'd what they Deliver'd; they
preach'd their Sermons, rather than read
them in the Pulpit; they spoke from the
Heart to the Heart, nothing like our cold
Declaiming Way, entertain'd now as a Mode,
and read with a Flourish, under the ridicu∣lous
Notion of being Methodical; but what
they conceiv'd by the Assistance of the
Great Inspirer of his Servants, <HI>the Holy Spi∣rit,</HI>
they deliver'd with a becoming Gravity,
a decent Fervour, an affectionate Zeal, and
<PB N="290" REF="301"/>
a Ministerial Authority, suited to the Dig∣nity
of the Office, and the Majesty of the
Work; and as a Testimony of this their
practical Works, left behind them, are a living
<HI>Specimen</HI> of what they perform'd among us:
Such are the large Volumes of Divinity re∣maining
of Dr <HI>Goodwin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Owen,</HI> Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charnock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Clarkson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> Mr.
<HI>How,</HI> and others, too many to mention.</P>
<P>It will be a sad Testimony of the decli∣ning
State of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> to
examine the Race of Ministers that fill'd
up the Places of those gone before; but more
especially the Stock Springing up to succeed
those now employ'd; and to compare them
with those gone off the Stage. It is not the
Design of this Work to make Personal Re∣flections,
or Invidious Comparisons; as few as
possible shall be pointed out. The Ministers,
now Serving you, are too modest not to own
the Fact; the Young ones Introducing, too
Ignorant to have their Opinion valu'd, tho'
they should Oppose it; and that Pride which
leads them to think otherwise, is the very
Ignorance and Defect we complain of.</P>
<P>To avoid entring into the odious Parti∣culars
more than is needful, to make out
what is alleged, it may be proper to examin
the Reason of the Difference between the
Ministers of this Age and the last; and if it
appears, that the Decay is a necessary Con∣sequence
<PB N="291" REF="302"/>
of the present Management of Af∣fairs
among the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> and that it real∣ly
can be no otherwise, there will be less
need of dipping into Characters.</P>
<P>Three Things in the Management of the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> relating to their Ministers, makes
it impossible they should come up to the
Pitch of the last Age; and will make a far∣ther
Decay infallibly the Consequence, if
they do not, in time, think of some Method
to correct the Mistake, restrain the Spread∣ing
of the Mischief, and bring Learning and
Preaching more in Use among them than it
seems to be at present: These are,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Manner of supplying the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
with Ministers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Manner of managing them, when
they come to Preach.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Taste of the Hearers of what they
Preach.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>If all these are alter'd from what they
formerly were, and that so much as to make
a Decay of the Ministry unavoidable, then
there will want very little Assistance to prove,
that there is such a Decay, or that this De∣cay
tends to the Ruin of the Dissenting Inte∣rest:
The Author of this, designing it only
for the Conviction of the Parties concern'd,
in order to their speedy looking into it for
Amendment, and for Recovery of the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="303"/>
Interest, before it be too late, avoids
many Enlargements and illustrations, which
he could bring, perhaps more to the Advan∣tage
of the Argument than to the People he
is speaking to.</P>
<P>But in order to the Plainness and Bre∣vity
design'd, and to come directly to the
Point, we desire you, the <HI>Dissenters in and
about</HI> London <HI>especially,</HI> to examine, seriously,
whether the following Account of the Sup∣plies
of Ministers
be Matter of Fact or no;
if you find <HI>it is not,</HI> every Honest Man will
be Contented, and glad to see it Contradicted
and Disapprov'd, and <HI>if it be,</HI> they will be
much more glad to see you set heartily about
some Method to reform it, and to restore,
if possible, a Painful, Learned, Judicious, and
Pious Ministry to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> which alone
can prevent the Destruction of their Interest,
and the Return of their Posterity to the
Church, from whence we think we had
good Reason to withdraw.</P>
<P>The Supply of Ministers is to be under∣stood
Twofold; i. By Educating and Bring∣ing
up Youth to the Work: And 2. By
Calling, Removing, or Transplanting Mi∣nisters
already brought up from one Place
to another. The First respects the whole
Body of <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> The Se∣cond
chiefly respects <HI>London,</HI> and the other
Capital Cities or Towns where the Congre∣gations
are wealthy and large.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="304"/>
To begin with the Education of Ministers.
It is true, and it is not lay'd as a Blame up∣on
the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> that they being a Body of
People under what we may call <HI>Persecuted
Circumstances,</HI> Tolerated, indeed, by the hap∣py
Conjunction of <HI>Circumstances</HI> in the Go∣vernment
they live under, but under narrow
contracted limits of the Law, and a Jealousy
of their having rather too much than too
little Liberty, have not the Encouragement
of Preferments, Ecclesiastical Honours, and
Advantages, or large Stipends and Benefices
to raise their Ministers to, and thereby to
prompt them to hard and laborious Study,
and to the necessary Qualifications that are
requisite in this Case. On the contrary,
the Utmost they have before them, when
they set out, is a despis'd and ejected Condi∣tion;
to be Mock'd, Contemn'd, and Mal∣treated
by the Times, and to be sure never
to rise Higher than a meer Parish Priest.
A Minister of a private Congregation lies
under many Disadvantages which the <HI>Church</HI>
Men are free from; he frequently, and gene∣rally
lives an entire dependent upon the
Benevolence of his Hearers, to whom he is, by
that Means, in a Manner wholly subjected
and liable always to their Peicks, Dis∣gusts,
and Cavils, whether reasonable or
unreasonable; nay, sometimes to their Slan∣ders
and Reproach, by which he is expos'd
to be blasted by their Breath, and, if Injur'd
<PB N="294" REF="305"/>
has no Remedy left him as a Minister, nay,
less than another Man in many Respects.
This is attended with such Consequences
as these:</P>
<P>1. That few of those who have any
Thing to give their Children, or at least
any Thing considerable, can entertain the
Thought of Breeding them up to so Dispised
a State as that of the Ministry.</P>
<P>2. That of those that are brought up to it,
if any great Estate or Honour befalls them,
either by Descent, or Accident, they soon
grow weary of the contemptible Employ∣ment,
and lay By their Books.</P>
<P>3. That if any Temptation of Advance∣ment
offers them, they are the sooner
brought off to comply and change their
Party. Tho' it is not to be doubted but, that
Want of a Foundation in Principle, and a
Stock of Learning to support it, has been a
greater Occasion of a Defection than the
Temptation of Money; of which by it self.</P>
<P>To descend then to the Manner of Bring∣ing
up our Young Ministers among the
<HI>Dissenters:</HI> It is evident that at this Time,
<HI>and for some Tears past,</HI> the Ministers of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are, <HI>generally Speaking,</HI> bread
up upon Charity. This Charity is, either
when any particular Person or Congrega∣tion
has taken up a Youth some Way or
other related to them, (and generally for
the sake of their Parent) and has been at the
<PB N="295" REF="306" MS="y"/>
Charge of their Education; or by what they
call the <HI>Fund:</HI> This <HI>Fund</HI> is a certain Sum
of Money partly collected, either Annually
or Quarterly, at the <HI>Meeting-House</HI> Doors,
prompted by the earnest Exhortation of the
Ministers, and partly obtain'd by Gifts of
well-dispos'd Persons, some by Yearly Al∣lowance
in their Lives, and others by Le∣gacies
at their Death.</P>
<P>There is not the least Design to object
here against the faithful Disposition of the
Money so collected, or the Care of the Mi∣nisters
to whom it is generally entrusted in
Applying it. The Schools that have been
erected; the Methods taken for Instructing
Youth; the Learning they get there, are no
Part of the Complaints here made: The Ma∣sters,
no question, do their best to train up, and
instruct the Youth committed to them; all
the Complaints I have met with of that kind,
seem to me either very trivial, or ill prov'd, and
very well answer'd by Mr. <HI>Sam. Palmer,</HI> (tho'
since he has chang'd his Noat,) in his Reply
to Mr. <HI>Samuel Westly's</HI> Letter and Defence.</P>
<P>But the Thing is impossible in its own
Nature, the Disadvantages of private Acade∣mies,
being without Publick Libraries, with∣out
Polite Conversation, without Suited Au∣thority,
with Classes to check and examin
one another, and, above all, without Time
given to finish the Youth in the Studies they
apply to, are unavoidable. The Education to
<PB N="296" REF="307"/>
be had there, is on these and several other
such as can by no Means answer the End,
or ever bring Mankind up to the pitch of
Greatness that the former Age was arriv'd
to: Here and there one, a Youth bless'd
with an extraordinary Genius, strong Parts,
and great Application, may Out-strip Others;
and these, under all the Discouragements and
Difficulties above, may rise to a Pitch beyond
the common Rate: But, like <HI>David's</HI> Second
Rate Worthies, they may be great; howbeit
they do not come up to the Rate of the First?</P>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> by the Way, <HI>is to be noted the Ig∣norance
and Blindness of the</HI> Dissenters <HI>Ene∣mies,
in their exclaiming against their Schools
and Accademies; and endeavouring to pull
them down:</HI> Whereas, <HI>If they would pull the</HI>
Dissenters <HI>down, their only way to do it, is to
let their Accademies stand; but to pull their
Accademies down, is only the way to force them
to send their youth to fitter Places.</HI> This is
evident in the first Years after the Expulsion
of Ministers, before the private Accademies
were erected; and when their Ministers were
generally Educated Abroad, from whence
they came much better finish'd, than they
do now, from our private Accademies; and
this makes the present Set of Ministers, that
are also wearing off the Stage, deserve this
Character, <HI>That tho' they do not come up to the
first number of Worthies,</HI> of whom mention
is made, <HI>yet they go far beyond any that we
see like to come after them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="308"/>
But to go back from the Schools to the
Schollars; let us examin, a little, the Circum∣stances
of the Youth, and, if possible, come at
the Ground of the Defect; and a fair Appeal
is made to the Age for the Truth of the Case.</P>
<P>A poor Widow is left Destitute, and a true
Object of Pity; her Husband was a Member
of such or such a Congregation; was, per∣haps,
a Benefactor while he liv'd; a Good
Man, Well-belov'd, and deserv'd it: The
Woman is the same; she is now Desolate,
has a House full of Children, and no Provi∣sion
made for them; wherefore, not know∣ing
how to provide for them otherwise, she
is willing to Dedicate One or Two of them
to the Service of God. <HI>By the way,</HI> it is too
unhappy a Truth, tho' a severe Sarcasm on
the Persons, that <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>his Cause,</HI> should
have little of their Help, if they could live
without it; and the Reason is given before;
but being in this Condition, the Widow
aforesaid, makes Friends to her Minister to
get her Son into <HI>the Fund;</HI> so the Bank or
<HI>Charity-Money,</HI> for Education of Ministers,
<HI>as before</HI> is publickly call'd. The Congre∣gation
in Respect to the Memory of the Fa∣ther,
and in Compassion to the Widow, join
in the Proposal, and agree to take the Chil∣dren
off her Hands; and all these are very
good Principles in their kind. But as this re∣lates
to a Minister of God's Word, <HI>I conceive</HI>
the Case alters; and many Things joyn to
<PB N="298" REF="309"/>
make this Practice very Destructive to the
<HI>Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Here is not a Word of Enquiry made
into the Genius, the Capacity, or the Inclina∣tion
of the Child, or Children. <HI>The Case is
not</HI> what they are fit for, but they must not be
Starved; the poor Woman must be reliev'd,
perhaps the Boy is a Native Blockhead: <HI>If
any such Thing be:</HI> Perhaps he is of a Fiery
Temper, all Volatile, and not at all fit for the
Work; perhaps he has had a Defect in his
Speech, Stammers and Hesitates, and cannot
express himself; perhaps Purblind, Squint-Eyed,
Near-sighted, or the like, yet he must be
a Minister, <HI>the Reason is in the Mother, not
in the Boy.</HI> From hence the Work of God,
the <HI>Sacred Harvest</HI> is Labour'd, and Dress'd
by the Lame and the Halt; and he that
would not, in Times past, admit any Priest
to serve at his Altar, that had any Blemish,
or Natural Defect, is now serv'd with <HI>Stam∣merers,
Squint-Ey'd, Deaf,</HI> and almost <HI>Dumb
Preachers.</HI> What Natural Defects do we see
in the Pulpit, besides those of <HI>Memory,</HI>
of <HI>Application,</HI> of <HI>Morals,</HI> and of <HI>Learning?</HI>
This I take to be the most Preposterous of all,
and is an Error can never be answer'd but
by being Reformed; 'tis no doubt, the proper
Duty of Parents, and in this Case of the <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI>
also to whom this Charge is committed,
to study the Capacities, the Temper, the In∣clination,
and the Common Gifts of their
<PB N="299" REF="310"/>
Children, in their designing them for Em∣ployment
in the World; and a Child that has
an Imperfection in his Speech, should no
more be put to be a <HI>Minister,</HI> or a <HI>Lawyer,</HI>
than they should put a <HI>Cripple</HI> to be a <HI>Dan∣cing-Master.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this Injurious only to the Ministry,
and to the Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in general,
but it is Injurious to the Children themselves
in particular: Will such be able to do the
Work they are bred to? Will they ever come
to any Thing? Will they get their Bread?
It were much better they were made <HI>Porters,</HI>
Grooms, or any lawful Mechanick; that way
they might get their Livings; but the other
is to breed them up as if on purpose to be di∣spis'd
Beggars, and Starve. One blam'd a young
Man of my Acquaintance, that had been bred
a Minister, for leaving off his Book when a
good Estate befell him; and for turning Gen∣tleman
when he was set apart to the sacred
Employment of a Minister. His Answer was
Witty, yet Grave; Course to himself, yet “In∣genuous:
<HI>When my Father was Poor, he
made me a Minister; as it was, he was
wrong, and spoiled a good Porter, for I was
never fit for it: When my Father grew Rich,
he told me, if I could make a Minister I should
be never the worse to make a Gentleman: I
have Learning enough for a Long-Wig, tho'
I had not for a Band: Now I can Talk and
be heard; but if I had Preach'd I had been
good for nothing.”</HI></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="311"/>
The Neglect of examining into the Chil∣dren
thus put out, is the Cause why, as
before, some <HI>Purblind,</HI> some <HI>Stammering,</HI>
some <HI>Hesitating</HI> in Speech, some <HI>Hair-Lips,</HI>
some without <HI>Palates,</HI> and others without
<HI>Brains,</HI> are sent to the Schools to make Mini∣sters.
Never wonder if the very Discourage∣ments
that arise from such Natural Defects
make these come out again Unfinish'd: It is
too Ungrateful a Subject to enter far into the
Consequences of these Things: But it must
have something said to it: The Natural In∣firmities
above are visible, and I believe no
Man will excuse the Error: It is mention'd
seriously, here to recommend it to the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
for a Remedy, they know the Truth
of it too well, the Evil is avoided by the
least Inspection imaginable.</P>
<P>But come we next to that Defect, we call
<HI>want of Brains;</HI> this is harder to be disco∣ver'd,
and the more, because we are not wil∣ling
to discover it: Affection in the Parents,
and Charity in the Ministers; one can not,
and the other care not to see the Child is a
Fool; but it seems less excusable in the Ma∣sters,
they may see it, they can see it, and
they ought to see it.</P>
<P>If the Boy be a Clod, a meer Stupid, a
Block without a Head, or if he be a Flutter,
a meer Feather, the one too hard, the other
too soft; one too thick, and the other too thin
for a Stock of Learning; one so contracted in
<PB N="301" REF="312"/>
the Head there is no room to hold it, the
other so thin there's no Power to retain it,
to what Purpose should Schoolmasters go
to invert Nature, and force the Current?
Give a Blockhead Learning, you make him
a worse kind of Blockhead than he was be∣fore.
Give a Fool Learning, you make
him a <HI>Rake, a Fop,</HI> and at last quite a <HI>Lu∣natick.</HI>
Letters, like fine Cloaths, let them
be never so well made, so gay, or so rich,
they will never make the Man Genteel,
if he has no Shapes: <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> joyn'd,
make an exquisite and accomplish'd Piece,
<HI>take it in what you will;</HI> nay, <HI>Nature</HI> may
go far without <HI>Art,</HI> but <HI>Art</HI> without <HI>Nature</HI>
is a <HI>Rider</HI> without a <HI>Horse,</HI> a <HI>Bullet</HI> with∣out
a <HI>Gun,</HI> an <HI>Arrow</HI> without a <HI>Bow,</HI> a <HI>Male</HI>
without a <HI>Female,</HI> perfectly Useless, Impo∣tent,
and uncapable to produce any Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Yet this is not all;</HI> but suppose the Boy
now accepted by the Fund, put to the School,
and abate all the <HI>Defects</HI> above; allow him
to be tolerably Capable, Diligent, Sober,
Moral, <HI>and the like:</HI> Well; <HI>he comes to the
Accademy,</HI> there he reads his <HI>Logicks, Ethicks,
Pneumaticks,</HI> &amp;c. on he goes, looks a little
into <HI>Philosophy,</HI> and at last to his <HI>Divinity;</HI>
perhaps he takes a Proportion of all these,
and by this Time he begins to write <HI>Man,</HI>
look Abroad in the World, gets a Black Coat
and a Band, and behaves well; as soon as
he appears any Thing like, the <HI>Directors</HI> of
<PB N="302" REF="313"/>
this <HI>Charity</HI> begin to think of Removing
him, that he has Learning enough to be seen
Abroad, and they prompt him to Preach;
he has declaim'd a little in the Schools, he
has his <HI>A, B, C,</HI> of <HI>Theologicks,</HI> with some
Study he can prepare a formal Theme, set a
Text on the Top of it, and, when it is written
down, can read it in a Pulpit; and this he
calls <HI>Preaching!</HI> Then he is a Minister, he
has no more Business at the Schools. And
thus, as he was hastily put in, so he is hasti∣ly
thrust out, to make room for some other
of equal Capacity and Circumstances.</P>
<P>Well; now we find him Abroad, poor
Gentleman! his Circumstances are hard; his
Mother, instead of being able to keep him, is,
perhaps, by this Time grown Old, and ex∣pects
he should keep her, or at least some
of his Younger Sisters: He is so far from
having Money to buy Books, that he wants
Money to buy Bread; he has no Time to
stay at Home to study, for he must go A∣broad
to get a Dinner.</P>
<P>The first Thing the unhappy Creature
has to do, is to make his Acquaintance among
the Ministers; in Order to this, he goes
every <HI>Tuesday</HI> to <HI>Salters-Hall,</HI> from thence
he waits upon them to <HI>Hamlin's Coffee-House,</HI>
where he fits at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>
and, unless some better Chance offers, he
Dines upon a Dish of <HI>Coffee,</HI> while others go
to Dinner where Invitation directs.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="314"/>
Having thus brought him Abroad, his
Work is to ply in his Habit, as the Labourer,
or the Porter with the Knot and the Ticket at
the Corner of the Streets. Here, if any Mi∣nister
is Sick, or wants to go into the Coun∣try,
or upon any Occasion cannot preach, he
may be supply'd at the shortest Warning,
for the Young Men have their Tools always
about them, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Pocket-Bible,</HI> and a Set of
<HI>Sermons</HI> ready written, which they Preach
(Read) over in Course, and then begin again,
and so a few of the first Week's Study serves
them for several Years. The Truth of which
is so plain and self-evident, that it needs no
farther Enquiry: But it calls for Lamenta∣tion,
and immediate Redress, if we expect the
Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> shou'd be supported.</P>
<P>The Application with which these poor
despicable Things, follow this Part of the
Work, is an undeniable Testimony of their
necessitous <HI>Circumstances.</HI> The Place is a
Proof of the <HI>Fact,</HI> there they are to be seen
Daily Plying for a Pulpit, that they may get
Ten Shillings to live upon; and so much are
they to be pity'd, so much do many of them
deserve a better Fate, that this Discourse is
made really in Companssion to them, and, if
possible, to recommend it to a Remedy, not
really to expose them. Then, as to the Ad∣vantage
made this Way, many do not meet
with a favourable Hit once a Month, and,
after the most diligent Attendance, are oblig'd
<PB N="304" REF="315"/>
to live on the last happy Relief till they
come to the utmost Extremity.</P>
<P>It is needless to touch here at the Per∣formance
of these Gentlemen; some of them
perform to Admiration, considering the Cir∣cumstances;
and 'tis lest to the Judgment of
all those that know what is requisite to finish
and compleat a Man of Learning, how long
Time ought, in Reason, to be allow'd to set a
Man out to preach in this <HI>Age, and more espe∣cially</HI>
to determine, if it can be possible they
should be good for much as they are equipp'd.</P>
<P>And are these the Measures the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
take to supply their Ministry? Is this Me∣thod
likely to produce a Succession fit to fol∣low,
and to finish the Work begun by the
Race that went before them? Was Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charnock,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clarkson,</HI> &amp;c.
brought up with such a Froth of Letters, as
this? Did they get their <HI>Theologicks,</HI> and
<HI>Metaphysicks</HI> in a Year or Two's Reading?
Were they furnish'd with a Body of Divinity,
suitable to the Work they did, and the Proofs
they have left behind them, in being Three
Years at an Accademy?</P>
<P>After the long Expectation, and Miserable
Porter-like waiting Above, it is now and then
tha Fate of one of these Gentlemen to get
some Charge, to get into some Subsistence?</P>
<P>The first Step, is generally to joyn Three
or Four together, and set up some <HI>Evening∣Lecture,</HI>
and, once a Month, to beg their Bread
<PB N="305" REF="316"/>
of the Hearers as an Alms: Were it a Sub∣scription
the Exception would be much less,
for the Work is laudable and proper: Why
should they be asham'd of it: But to get
the Help of Others to flourish on their Ca∣pacity
and Undertaking, and, perhaps, with∣out
much Merit, to perswade the People to
Contribute: How Scandalous? How Mean?
And how does it Eclipse the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> nay,
even the Preaching of the Gospel.</P>
<P>But be that as it will: Let their Study,
their Conduct, their Performance, be look'd
into, how has it dwindled in a few Years?
How has the Preaching sunk among the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
into all manner of Coldness, Mean∣ness,
Dull Fashionable Reading, &amp;c. in∣stead
of Preaching? But this shall be con∣sider'd
farther by and by.</P>
<P>2. The Second Head of Supplying the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> with Ministers, respects the Trans∣planting
and Removing Ministers from one
Congregation to another. This, in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
is one of the most solemn Things which
their Church Judicatories exercise their Au∣thority
about, and is never done Judicially;
but where <HI>evident Utility</HI> is the Great and
Only Consideration; And in this Case it is
very frequent to remove a Minister from a
large Stipend, a pleasant Dwelling, advanta∣geously
Seated near to the Capital, or perhaps
in a Great Town, to a less Stipend, in Bar∣ren
Mountains, and the remotest Corners of
<PB N="306" REF="317"/>
the Nation: In this Case the <HI>Minister,</HI> con∣tented
to be sacrific'd for the Good of the
whole Body, chearfully forsake their com∣fortable
Dwellings and sufficient Mainte∣nance
to comply with it, testifying, that
they do not expect their Reward on Earth,
or follow <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for the Loaves and the
Fishes.</P>
<P>But to examine our Removing of <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI>
would be to confess the Methods and
Motions, are just contrary; 1. The City of
<HI>London,</HI> which, <HI>without Reflecting in the
least upon some of the Ministers, eminent in
their Practise and Capacities,</HI> is (taking one
with another, and Judging in Proportion)
much worse supply'd with <HI>Ministers</HI> than
the Country: The Reasons of which may
be examin'd hereafter. 2. SOME of the
best <HI>Ministers</HI> the City now have, are such
as they have, by a Sort of Importunate Vio∣lence,
ravish'd the Country of, and drawn
from the remotest Parts; whether Injuri∣ously,
or by the Consent of the People
there, may also, in Time, come to be enquire'd;
and most of these are, truly, Great Men:
But it seems very unhappy, that of all the
Gentlemen Educated, in or near <HI>London,</HI> by
the Funds, <HI>&amp;c. as above,</HI> there are very
few of whom it would not be call'd <HI>Flat∣tery</HI>
to name them among those we call
Eminent, except for something better left
out than mention'd</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="318"/>
This Method of Calling <HI>Ministers</HI> out of
the Country has hitherto been practis'd in
such a Magisterial Way, and such a Sort of
a positive Sending for them, as if they were
not to be deny'd. It has been founded upon
a Presumption, That the Living at <HI>London,</HI>
the Reputation of being call'd thither, and
the Encrease of Stipend or Maintenance, are
Arguments suffcient to command a <HI>Minister;</HI>
or at least are so equivalent to a Command,
that they are not to be resisted: And two
Things are especially prov'd by this; 1.
All that is said before of the Insuffciency
of our <HI>London</HI> Education, and the Country
being better supply'd is acknowledg'd, since,
no sooner is any considerable Place vacant in
<HI>London,</HI> but the Country is plunder'd to sup∣ply
the Want; while, at the same Time, the
<HI>Fund-Bred</HI> Creatures, about <HI>London,</HI> lie Star∣ving
and Plying as before. 2. That neither
Justice to their <HI>Brethren,</HI> Respect to their <HI>Mini∣sterial
Obligation,</HI> between Pastor and People,
much less Concern for the Publick Interest of
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> or the Capacity of Doing Good
seems to be regarded in the People Calling.</P>
<P>We have, indeed, some Instances of the
Conscientious Regard some <HI>Ministers</HI> have
had to the relation between them and their
Congregations, and their Sense of their be∣ing
most useful to God's Church, preferring
it to their being most useful to their own
Families, and accordingly of their Rejecting
<PB N="308" REF="319"/>
the greatest Offers made to them of Remo∣ving
them from their little Retirements in
Remote Parts, in Order to being made Rich,
Easy, and Popular, either in <HI>London</HI> or
elsewhere: Such as these were Mr. <HI>James
Owen, of Shresbury,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wood, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tall,</HI> near
<HI>Berwick,</HI> and others. I wish I could have
said the like of an Eminent and most Use∣ful
<HI>Minister</HI> lately Borrow'd, <HI>I had almost
said Stolen,</HI> from a remote Part of <HI>England,</HI>
from a Place where we all know he was
most especially useful, from a Place that
cannot want him, where the Loss of him
will never be repair'd, and where the Inte∣rest
of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> is in great Danger of
Breaking for Want of him; where the
Wound made by Removing him will not
easly, if ever, be repair'd and this to be
brought to <HI>London;</HI> where, without Breach
of Charity, it may be said he cannot be
equally useful to others, (whatever he may
be to himself) as he was before. I will not
go about to say or suggest that either the
Pomp of the World, the Fame of being
known, or the Honour of having a Name
spread, could be any Motive to him to come;
but sure the People must have a mean Opi∣nion
of that <HI>Minister</HI> to suppose those Things
would tempt him: The Merit of that Gen∣tleman
is Eminent for that unfashionable
Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> That he has always sought
more to excell than to be talk'd of, more the
<PB N="309" REF="320"/>
Service than the Fame, and this has built
him a real Fame which shall never decay;
it is known that with Reluctance he yielded
to the Importunities of those who invited
him hither; but the Reluctance with which
his People parted with him is not to be ex∣press'd,
any more than the Injury done to
the <HI>Dissenting Interest</HI> in that Part of the
Island, which it is no Arrogance to say no
Man is better, and few are so well able to
support. The People who have him, and
think he is their Blessing here, had need
think well of making a mighty Improvement
under his <HI>Ministry,</HI> lest they have to answer
for their Sterillity under so great an Oppe∣ration,
and for the Robbing those of him
that would have turn'd his Labours with
them to a much better Account.</P>
<P>But, to descend from the Religious Part,
it is strange to me to observe the Justice of
this Matter, not so much referring to the
present Case, as to state from it both the
Evil of the Practice, and the Injury done
by it to themselves; and therefore, without
making <HI>Panegyricks</HI> on the Christian Con∣duct
of those <HI>Ministers,</HI> who have chosen ra∣ther
to continue in their private Conditions,
in meer Zeal to their Work, Affection to
their People, and Sense of their Duty, whose
Praise is of God, and their Reward in Eter∣nity,
let the Wisdom, the Integrity, the
Christianity, and the Honesty of the People
<PB N="310" REF="321"/>
thus Calling them, bear a little Reflection,
What have the <HI>London Dissenters</HI> to Offer
in Justification of their Calling <HI>Ministers</HI> from
their respetive Charges in the Country, in
the Manner they now practise it, or to make
their Calling them thus, consistent with Reli∣gion
or common Justice? All the Arguments
we yet find made Use of, I mean on the Side
of those who call them, Consist in the
Advance of Sallary, or Stipend, Popularity,
and the Ease and Advantages of Living here:
These are of a Kind so base, that I will not
suggest they are of the least Weight with a
<HI>Minister of the Gospel,</HI> whose Heart is in his
Work; to whom Usefulness to Souls, and
Propagating the Knowledge of God, and
the Kingdom of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ ought
to be,</HI> and I hope is among most of the <HI>Dis∣senting
Ministers,</HI> not the supreme View alone,
but the only View they respect in the Plant∣ing
or Scituating themselves in the World.</P>
<P>This Mammon of Unrighteousness we
find happily rejected on many Occasions, yet
it is not without too frequent Success; but at
best the Principle by which it is offer'd is
Scandalous in all; as if Coveting our Neigh∣bour's
Wife or our Neighbour's Minister
were not equally forbidden in the Tenth
Commandment, in which we acknowledge
we are forbidden all Inordinate Motions to
any Thing that is our Neighbour's. Vide
<HI>Alsemb. Chatech, Pa.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="322" MS="y"/>
In this fatal Way of bringing the Country
<HI>Ministers</HI> from their Charge, or Congrega∣tions,
such a Variety of Irregular Practises
follow, that I hardly know where to begin.
How they rather send for them up than in∣vite
them, presuming on the Force of their
meaner Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> Interest, as before;
how they satisfy themselves with the Know∣ledge
of the Person upon Out-sides, and that
worst Giver of Characters, <HI>Common Fame;</HI>
oftentimes not Descending to a more parti∣cular
Taste of his Ability; perhaps the Per∣son
is of unquestion'd Capacity, of a superi∣our
Character, and of a Merit not to admit
any Debate, as in the late eminent Instance;
yet the best <HI>Minister,</HI> the late <HI>Preacher,</HI> the
best <HI>Commentator</HI> may not be so particularly
suited to the Taste or Acceptance of this or
that particular People as another; and in
this Variety consists much Advantage to
both <HI>Minister and People;</HI> whereas without
it, few Congregations could be serv'd to their
Satisfaction, and sometimes many <HI>Churches</HI>
would clash for the same <HI>Minister;</HI> and it
seems a Token of very much Indifference to
choose a Man by Report, and like him be∣cause
other Men lik'd him. <HI>Then as to the
Justice of it in the next Place.</HI></P>
<P>Let us ask what Enquiry has been made in
such Cases, whether or no his People were
willing to part with him, Robbing a Congre∣gation,
nay, perhaps a whole County of a
<HI>Minister,</HI> not only exceedingly useful among
<PB N="312" REF="323"/>
them, but belov'd by them, a Man valu'd by all
Ranks of Men, <HI>Church or Dissenter,</HI> if this ne∣ver
weigh'd with them, if the <HI>Honesty,</HI> the <HI>ju∣stice,</HI>
and the <HI>Seasonableness</HI> of this was never
concerted or debated among them, what shall
be said for it? They hear of a famous Man,
they have read his Labours in Print; and
upon this they call him at a Venture:
Tho' perhaps had they read more practi∣cally,
they would have found their very
Behaviour condemn'd even by himself.</P>
<P>In the next Place; Do they make En∣quiry
into the Obligation such a <HI>Minister</HI>
may be under to the People whom he serves
in his <HI>Ministerial Relation?</HI> This leaves
them, really, under gross Reflections, as ha∣ving
bury'd all Regard to mutual Engage∣ment,
and not a little shews a mean Opinion
of the <HI>Minister</HI> they call, as if he could have
dispenc'd with those <HI>Relative Obligations,</HI> and
as if the great Consideration of <HI>Usefulness</HI>
had no Weight with him; or, which is
worse, as if they would all be born down
by the Bait of a large Income; the Vanity
of being Carefs'd by the Rich Inhabitants of
the Capital City, and the Pleasure of Com∣ing
up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>These Things leave abundant Room for
the Good People in the Country to reflect
on the Justice, Honesty, and Charity of
their <HI>London</HI> Brethren: But not at all to
thank them for their Kindness to them;
<PB N="313" REF="324"/>
concluding, that they have not enough re∣garded
in it that Golden-Rule, among some
other. <HI>Quod tihi sieri non Vis Alteri ne
Feceris.</HI></P>
<P>What shall we say next to the wretched
Change among the Lay-part of the <HI>Dissen∣ters,</HI>
not only that which they are already
come into, but more especially that which
they are every Day farther running into, as
to the Management of their Ministers, when
Chosen. <HI>DiFFicile est Satyram non Scribere:</HI>
How is the Energy of the Spirit of God,
which accompany'd the last Age, succeeded
by Formality, Gaiety, empty Un-meaning
Sound and Jingle of Words, without the
Power and Force, either of Religion or of true
Eloquence, and how are the People pleas'd
with it? Metaphors without Meaning; Stile
without Cadence; Letters without Learn∣ing,
and which is worst of all, Divinity
without Gospel? How does the Excellency
of the Young Race consist in <HI>Pulpit Gesture,</HI>
Powder'd <HI>Hair,</HI> Clean <HI>Gloves,</HI> and a Levity
of Behaviour, which I care not to mention?
And how do those Things recommend them
to us? Are these the Men that are God's In∣struments
for the Great Work of <HI>Converting
of Souls?</HI> Are these Men prepared for the
Labourious Self-denying Work of the <HI>Mini∣stry?</HI>
Are these the Fruits of a <HI>Holy Devoted
Soul,</HI> Eaten up with the Zeal of God's House,
and whose Heart rejoyces at the Appearance
<PB N="314" REF="325"/>
and Goings of the Spirit of God in his Sanctu∣ary?
And who is it spoils the young Mini∣sters,
are not the Hearers accessary?</P>
<P>How many a Hopeful Youth have we had,
that has <HI>set Out</HI> well, that having come from
the Accademy, tho' <HI>alas! before his Time,
as abovesaid,</HI> with a good Stock of Modesty,
<HI>some</HI> Well-meaning, a <HI>few</HI> Letters, <HI>and much
room for more;</HI> has been <HI>Ruin'd</HI> by Flat∣tery,
<HI>made Vain</HI> by the Foolish Caresses of
the Town; <HI>Teiz'd</HI> from his Book, by Feast∣ing
and Treating, till first, having no Time
to Improve himself, he goes on, and growing
Conceited by the Praife of the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> at
last thinks he needs no Improvement at all,
which, had he been let alone, he Had never been
vain enough to believe of himself: Nor do
they leave him here: The very People that
Caress him are his Ruin, and do him the
greatest Injury in the World, since, as they
first run after him in the Lunacy of their
Judgement, for the Out-side of his Appear∣ance,
and the Surface of his Preaching: So,
for want of a serious Taste, a Sence of the
Fundamental of the Pulpit Gift; or which
is yet worse, upon the appearing of some new
<HI>Blazing-Star</HI> above their Horizon, they all run
away after the Novelty, and, forsaking the
former Idol of their Fancy, they leave him as
naked of Admirers, as he was at first of Merit.
Thus, having made him waste the pretious
Moments in which he should have Improv'd,
they leave him to grow more and more De∣spicable,
<PB N="315" REF="326"/>
as he comes to add Age to Empti∣ness,
and Years to want of Judgment: How
is this apparent in many Places of this Town,
where you find those Meetings Empty and
Void, where the same Workmen exert their
parts to the Bare-Walls, who were once the
Celebrated Orators of the Town.</P>
<P>These Things admit many Enlargements,
and it will be own'd this Book might be fil'd
with Unhappy Instances of like Nature, by
which the <HI>Dissenting</HI> Interest is divided
against itsel. The City set up to Starve the
Country of their Provision of Ministers, and
this added to the Error in Breeding up others,
leaves a sad Prospect of a Famine at last; a
Thing it were to be wish'd, they would take
into immediate Consideration, which is the
true and only Design of making these Mi∣stakes
so Publick.</P>
<P>The next Article in this unhappy En∣quiry,
relating to the Management of our
Ministers, when they come to Preach,
of course leads us back to the Schools,
from whence they Issue Out: It is too Un∣grateful
to Repeat what has been said before
of the unfinish'd Condition which they come
Abroad in. Hitherto it has been alledg'd,
only to be want of Time, and I leave it there,
being willing to avoid making Reflections
upon the Methods of the Schools; yet, to
venture a little upon the Masters, which
it is hoped they will Excuse, one Thing
<PB N="316" REF="327"/>
must be own'd to have ill-Effects, and we
find the Consequences of it every Day in
our Young Ministers.</P>
<P>Many of the Tutors in our Accademies,
<HI>I do not say all, because I know some of ano∣ther
Opinion,</HI> being careful to keep the Know∣ledge
of the Tongues, or particularly Fond
of <HI>Phylology,</HI> or for what other Reasons, <HI>per∣haps
'tis best not to enquir,</HI> tie down their
Pupils so exactly, and Limit them so strictly
to perform every Exercise, and to have all
their Readings in <HI>Latin</HI> or in <HI>Greek,</HI> that, at
the End of the severest Term of Study, nay,
were they to perform a Quarantine of Years
in the Schools, they come out unacquainted
with <HI>English,</HI> tho' that is the Tongue in
which all their Gifts are to shine. This is
an Abuse so gross, so undeniable in Fact, and
so mischievous in Consequence, that it is no
way to be accounted for.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, the great Imperfection of our
Accademies is want of Conversation; this the
Publick Universities enjoy; ours cannot: If a
Man pores upon his Book, and despises the
Advantage of Conversation, he always comes
out a Pedant, a meer Scholar, rough and un∣fit
for any thing out of the Walls of his Col∣ledge.
Conversation polishes the Gentle∣men
in Discourse, acquaints 'em with Men,
and with Words; lets them into the Polite
part of Language; gives them Stile, Accent,
Delicacy, and Taste in Expression; and when
<PB N="317" REF="328"/>
they come to appear in <HI>English,</HI> they Preach
as they Discourse, Easie, Free, Plain, Unaf∣fected,
and Untainted with Force, Stiffness,
Formality, affected hard Words, and all the
Ridiculous Parts of a Learned Pedant, which
is being interpreted a <HI>School Fop;</HI> while, on
the other Hand, from our Schools we have
abundance of Instances of Men that come
away Masters of Science, Criticks in the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> perfect in Languages;
and perfectly Ignorant (if that Term may be
allow'd) of their Mother Tongue, especially
as to the Beauties of Stile, Cadence, and Po∣liteness
of Language.</P>
<P>The Usefulness and Excellency of the
Languages is no way run down in this Obser∣vation;
but Preaching the Gospel, which is
the End of our Study, is done in <HI>English,</HI> and
it seems absurd to the last Degree, that
all the Time should be spent in the Lan∣guages
which it is to be <HI>Fetch'd from,</HI> and
none in the Language it is to be <HI>Deliver'd
in.</HI> A Man would blush to Read the very
Orthography of some among us, who are
Masters of all the Oriential Languages, who
can place their Accents right in the <HI>Greek,</HI>
can Criticise on the <HI>Latin,</HI> can Point the
<HI>Hebrew,</HI> and cannot Spell their <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>And why is it that some of the greatest
Schollars we have had among us, that have
the whole Mistery of the Gospel in their
Hearts, and a Body of Divinity in their
<PB N="318" REF="329"/>
Heads, that have a vast Stock of Learning, a
whole Ages Reading, and even a Burthen of
Letters in them, yet Preach away all their
Hearers, for want of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue,
while a Jingling, Noisie Boy, that has a good
Stock in his Face, and a Dysentry of the
Tongue, tho' he has little or nothing in his
Head, shall run away with the whole Town?
It is true, the Corruption of our Taste in
Hearing is to be accounted for in this; of
which afterward; but one Error is in the
first Concoction. It is true, the Head is the
main Thing that a Tutor is to see Furnish'd;
but the Tongue must be Tuned, or he'll make
no Musick with the Voice; so the Hand is
to be Taught to touch the Viol; but if the
Strings are not in Tune, the Musick will be
very harsh.</P>
<P>Acceptable Words, a good Diction, a Grave,
yet Polite, and Easie Stile in the <HI>English,</HI> is a
most taking and valuable Thing in a Mini∣ster,
and without which his Learning can∣not
exert itself: This we find generally
Neglected, and left wholly to Nature; and
this is the Mistake spoken of.</P>
<P>From this Neglect comes Foppish <HI>Gaiety,</HI>
Rambling <HI>Distraction,</HI> Stiff <HI>Formality,</HI> and
Surfeiting Affectation in <HI>Stile,</HI> all of them
fatal in their Degree, Unpolite, without
Cadence, without Energy, or without that
Easie, Free Plainness which is the Glory and
Excellency of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="330" MS="y"/>
There was, some Years ago, a private Ac∣cademy
of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> not far from <HI>London,</HI>
the Master or Tutor of which Read all his
Lectures, gave all his Systems, whether of
<HI>Phylosophy</HI> or <HI>Divinity,</HI> in <HI>English;</HI> had all his
Declaimings, and Disertations in the <HI>English</HI>
Tongue. And tho' the Scholars from that
Place were not Distitute in the Languages,
yet it is observ'd of them, they were by this
made Masters of the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, and more
of them excelled in that Particular, than of
any School at that Time. Here were produced
of Ministers, Mr. <HI>Timothy Cruso,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hannot,</HI>
of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Taylor,</HI> Mr. <HI>Owen,</HI>
and several Others; and of another kind, Poets
<HI>Sam. Wessley, Daniel De Foe,</HI> and two or three
of your <HI>Western</HI> Martyrs that, had they liv'd,
would have been extraordinary Men of that
kind, <HI>viz. Kitt. Battersby,</HI> Young <HI>Jenkins,
Hewlin,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>But to leave this as a School Defect, we
are now to bring the finish'd Pupil into the
World; and here we find a very unhappy
Error in the first Decoction of that kind, <HI>viz.</HI>
His <HI>Examination,</HI> or passing <HI>Tryals:</HI> And
it is left to the just Reflection of the Mini∣sters,
whether severer <HI>Tryals</HI> as well as better
<HI>Testimonials</HI> are not absolutely Necessary, be∣fore
they admit Young Probationers to the
Pulpit, unless they resolve at once to Depre∣ciate
the very Office, and reduce us to a neces∣ary
and just Contempt of the Ministry for the
fake of the Ministers.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="331"/>
This is but a hint; I know it has its Diffi∣culties,
nor are they easie to be surmounted,
and therefore the less is said to it: But one
Thing cannot be omitted, and which must be
acknowledg'd to be for the Service of the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> if they please to take the Hint as
kindly as it is meant.</P>
<P>This concerns the Admitting, or giving
Ordination, if we may stile it so, to Young
Men coming out of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The State of
which Case is, in short, thus:</P>
<P>The Conditions of Admission, and the
Tryals of Ministers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Hon∣our
of their Discipline be it said, are very
severe; and the Observation of it so st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t,
that it is impossible for Men of a mean <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣gree
of Study to get into a Pulpit. It is not
to the Purpose to Debate here, the abso∣lute
Necessity of School Learning to a Mi∣nister,
or how far the Office depends upon
the Ordination of Ministers, or the Call and
Efficency of the Spirit of God, since we are
speaking to those who, however they regard
the Latter, do insist upon the Former; and
it will appear the Mischief lies in admitting
such who, pretending to both, are possess'd
of neither; the Last will not admit a Tryal,
but the First will, and 'tis of that Tryal
which may be had that we are now speaking.</P>
<P>The Fact is undeniable, if a Young Stu∣dent
has been Idle, and Mis-spent his Hours,
if he has been Impatient, and thinks the
<PB N="321" REF="332"/>
Time too long, or if Conceited of himself,
and thinks he is Quallify'd, before his Su∣periors
think so; if he has Misbehav'd, and,
perhaps, been Extruded the College, or In∣curr'd
Scandal, and therefore not admitted
to Preach, he has no more to do but come
away to <HI>England:</HI> Here he either gets Ad∣mittance,
upon slight Examination, or runs
into the Office without any other Admit∣tance,
than that of the next Minister that
will lend him a Pulpit: It will be needless
to give Instances of a Thing that we are all
sensible of, and which the People in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
wonder at; the Business rather is how
to remedy the Evil, and prevent the Con∣sequences
of it; and this is so easie, that no∣thing
but a total Neglect of it can be an∣swer'd,
in the Case.</P>
<P>Would the <HI>Dissenters</HI> suffer no <HI>Scotsman</HI>
to Preach among them, unless he shew'd
Authentic Documents of his having been
admitted to the Ministry in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
would they admit none to the Office but
such as, besides their Examination, brought
Certificates from the Principal, and Professor
of Divinity in the College where they Stu∣dy'd,
and from the <HI>Presbytery</HI> of the Bounds
where they last Liv'd; the first signifying
their Studies, and Proficency in the Schools,
and the latter testifying their being free
from Scandal, and of a good Character: If
this short Method were observ'd, I. <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="333"/>
would be oblig'd to you, for that their
Scoundrels and Idle Ones would not Con∣temn
their Discipline, in hopes of being ad∣mitted
in <HI>England:</HI> They must then Study
hard, Apply close, and Live soberly, or they
must not expect to be receiv'd: And (2)
you would cease to be the Sink of their Filth,
the Receiver of their Refusings, and the Re∣fuge
of the Meanest and most Uncapable of
their Ministry.</P>
<P>It comes next to speak of the Behaviour
of these Young Proficient Gentlemen, when
they get into the Office: How they have taken
up a Method of Preaching quite different
from what was the Antient Practice; how,
under pretence of Cadence and Regularity,
which yet they want, they have brought the
whole Work to a cold declaiming way of De∣livery,
the very same we formerly blamed and
despised Others for; how, from a Cautious
and Conceal'd using of Notes, as our Ministers
were wont to use them, they are come to
an Avow'd, Open, and General <HI>Sermon-Read∣ing;</HI>
the meer Effect of Sloth, and without
which they could not make one Sermon serve
many Months, nay Years, upon every Occa∣sional
Preaching: So, taking away the Occa∣sion
of Study, as the great Drudgery of the
Office, and this not only is too much the
Practice, but it is now pretended a Minister
ought not to Preach without them.</P>
<P>What is become of the Zeal, the Affection,
<PB N="323" REF="334"/>
and the Warmth of the Pulpit, which the past
Age were Witnesses of, is hard to determine:
As to our Modern Preachers they Despise it
all, they call it, <HI>the Mechanism of the Spirit;</HI>
and resolve it into a kind of Priest-Craft, by
which they say Preachers could raise and
let fall their Hearers as they had Occa∣sion;
and now they are to tell you, that
the Spirit of God, being to Work by the
Word, there is no Occasion for the Mi∣nister
to mind how he Delievers it, so that
the Matter be good. From this coldness in
Preaching, as a most Natural Consequence
follows careless Hearing, Sleeping, all man∣ner
of Indecency, and at last a Contempt of
Ordinances, and bringing them down to a
meer Course of Things, which are discharg'd
in the Duty of Attendance without any re∣gard
to the Manner: But of this part by it
self.</P>
<P>From this coldness in Preaching and For∣mality
in one part of the Work proceeds a
proportion'd Neglect of the other great Work
of a Minister, I mean <HI>Prayer:</HI> However we
Object against Forms, this is now become as
Formal as that we Object against; nay, some
may be named who Write them down, and
Read their <HI>Prayers</HI> as they do their <HI>Sermons:
Sacraments</HI> are administer'd with unusual
want of Solemnity; and they are so shie of
attempting to act the Affections, that they
seem to perform all the Worship, and admi∣nifter
<PB N="324" REF="335"/>
all the Ordinances of the Gospel, as
if the Affections were not in the least con∣cern'd
in them.</P>
<P>In the Pulpit all manner of Gesture is ob∣serv'd,
that may render them acceptable to the
Eyes, not the Ears of their Hearers; and the
new Fashion'd young Ministers Powder and
Dress, as if the Pulpit was the Stage, and
they came there to make their Address to the
Ladies. God Almighty is spoken to rather
with Good Manners, than with Reverence;
and they rather approach him with <HI>Air</HI> and
<HI>Mein,</HI> than with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling: Prayer</HI>
with them is the Goldest, the Dullest, the
most Unaffecting Thing in the World; and,
indeed, they have most effectually secured
themselves from the Scandal of designing to
Work upon the Affections with it: There
is, indeed, one kind of <HI>Mechanism</HI> left among
them, and which they take Care not to fail
of, <HI>viz.</HI> That as some Preachers move one
Sence, some another; some raise the Passion
of <HI>Fear;</HI> some of <HI>Love;</HI> some Excite <HI>Zeal;</HI>
some <HI>Charity,</HI> these most effectually raise
a mighty Propensity to Sleep, and act beyond
an Opiate upon the Faculty of Drowsiness,
Charming their Auditory into <HI>Silver Sham∣bers,</HI>
which, according to a certain Modern
Orator, <HI>Are Golden Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>From their Pulpit Labours, and the
Drudgery of the Day, you may view them
in their Week, they are of too much Busi∣ness
<PB N="325" REF="336"/>
to be much at Home, except on <HI>Satur∣day,</HI>
and then they must not be disturb'd;
There, at once, is all Opportunity taken from
their poor Hearers to Visit, or Consult with
their <HI>Ministers</HI> whatever their Cases, ei∣ther
of <HI>Conseience</HI> or otherwise, may be, for
they are hardly ever to be found; and as to
Visiting their Hearers, if they are Rich, they
grow not only Visitors but Companions: But
if Poor, it is not hard to name some Young
<HI>Ministers</HI> in this City, who have not been to
visit some of the Poor, or Antient Members
of their Congregations in several Years.</P>
<P>The Vanity in Garb, the Exorbitance of
Living, the Gaiety in their Families, to∣gether
with their Haughty instead of Hum∣ble
Behaviour, of these Young New Advanc'd
Gentlemen in their Conversation I omit here,
not that they do not administer abundant
Matter of Reflection, and a sad Prospect for
the Time to come, but because this At∣tempt
is meant rather to Correct the Foun∣dation
Evil, and Removing the Causes,
than to attack the <HI>Vice</HI> of our Young Cler∣gy,
which, being rooted in their Ignorance
and Want of Learning, lies too deep to be
pull'd out; for <HI>Conceit</HI> and <HI>Affectation</HI> is the
certain Produce of a little Learning, as <HI>Hu∣mility</HI>
is of a great deal.</P>
<P>3. The Third and Last Article laid down,
in the Beginning of this Essay, is the Taste
of our People in Hearing; and, indeed, this
<PB N="326" REF="337"/>
suffers equal Defection: Whether the wo∣ful
Degeneracy of the <HI>Ministry</HI> proceeds from
that of the People, or this Error of the People
from the <HI>Ministry,</HI> shall not be enquir'd here,
least the Evil should appear Reciprocal, and
they be found like Men in a Plague, mu∣tually
to Infect one another.</P>
<P>That our Taste of Preaching is alter'd
with the Preaching, is evident from the
People we run after, and the People we run
from; from our Manner of Hearing, and
Manner of Living under the Operation of
a <HI>Protestant Gospel Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>In the Choice of our Preachers, what In∣stances
have we to determine us by, when,
as before is noted, a Half-bred Youth that
makes, as we call it, a good Figure in the
Pulpit, one of Mr. <HI>Burgess's</HI> Furbelo'd
Preachers that has a little Musick upon
his Tongue, and Reads handsomely, that
Talks apace, has the Gift of the Gob,
and pleases our Fancy, shall run away with
the whole Town, and draw Crowds of Hea∣rers
after him, while the Aged, the Learn'd,
the Serious, the Painful Preachers that, as
before, have the Essence of the Work in
their Heads, and the Success of it upon their
Hearts, preach to the bare Walls, and see
their Auditors Daily forsake them. This
might be illustrated by Names of Men: But
that this Paper avoids Entring into Personal
Characters, any Man may be satisfy'd of this
<PB N="327" REF="338"/>
that has seen, or heard of the Treatment of
many of our antient Ministers lately Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and set them against others, whom we need
not go far to name. Next we may observe
the Conviction which this Error brings along
with it, and how Time makes them asham'd
of their Folly: And this appears in their
Abandoning again those they have once been
so fond of; after their glutted Fancy, tir'd
with the Novelty, has Nauseated those they
have Idoliz'd before; this is seen in many
Instances now among us, which also I for∣bear
to name.</P>
<P>These are so many Testimonies, that the
Taste of the Town, debauch'd by Novelty,
is corrupted and carry'd away with a Stream;
that the true <HI>Gospel Principle</HI> of Hearing the
Word without Respect of Persons, is lost
from among us; and the Times seem to have
just such a Turn as is said of the <HI>Popish</HI>
Ages in <HI>England,</HI> in former Days, <HI>viz.</HI> That
in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Times they had <HI>Wooden Cha∣lices</HI>
and <HI>Golden Priests,</HI> but afterwards, as
the Times mended, and the Nation grew
Rich, they had <HI>Golden Chalices,</HI> and then
they had <HI>Wooden Priests.</HI> This, indeed, is
the Disaster of the <HI>Toleration;</HI> as all Sweet
Things have their Bitter in themselves: Be∣fore
the <HI>Toleration</HI> we had a <HI>Wooden People</HI>
and <HI>Golden Ministers;</HI> since we got Ease
and Wealth, we have a <HI>Golden People,</HI> but
God knows we are in a fair Way to have
a <HI>Wooden Ministry.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="339"/>
It has been touch'd already how our Car∣ressing,
Courting, Treating, and Flattering
our Young <HI>Ministry</HI> has been fatal to them,
as it robs them of their Time, the Life
Blood of their Work, as it puffs up, prompts
their Vanity, and fills them with Conceit
of their real Worth, when it may, perhaps,
be little more than Imaginary: Youth can∣not
always bear Praise, nor judge when they
ought to value it, or how much. On the
other Hand, the Evils of the Times have re∣quir'd
a reciprocal Compliance in the <HI>Mini∣sters</HI>
with the corrupt Latitudes of their Hear∣ers,
the <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
too justly call'd <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> by their Enemies,
has not only been practis'd by the Hearers,
but has been, at their Request, defended and
allow'd by some of their <HI>Ministers;</HI> and those
Gentlemen have set themselves up to defend
it at the same Time that they profess'd sta∣ted
<HI>Non-Conformity</HI> as a Duty; but how
Woodenly they have done it; how they
are now asham'd of it; and what Ruin this
has brought upon the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> our Silence
now acknowledges.</P>
<P>How evidently this <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI>
tends to, and in Posterity resolves in a com∣pleat
Conformity, is too evident to need any
farther Enquiry, and how directly this De∣fection
of the <HI>Ministry</HI> tends to both, is also
very plain: It needs no Enquiry whether the
Decay of Preaching should bring a Decay
<PB N="329" REF="340"/>
of Practise, and whether a cold <HI>Ministry</HI>
should not produce a careless People.</P>
<P>Let the Manner of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> Conduct,
under this new-fashion'd Dispensation, be
but examin'd: Go to their Houses, and how
is the Worship of God maintain'd there?
Let it be enquir'd whether one Master of a
Family in ten prays with his Family, or cate∣chises
his Children, or observes the Sabbath-Day,
of that great Number who practis'd all
these within these Twenty Years past: And
where are their Reprovers? Where the <HI>Mi∣nister</HI>
that examines them about it? or re∣proves
them for Want of it?</P>
<P>In former Days, in our <HI>Meetings,</HI> was
another Face of Hearing; some Writing;
some Following the <HI>Minister</HI> with their Bi∣bles;
all Attentive: Now Writing is uni∣versally
laid aside, as out of Fashion; and
for the Bible, take this Instance, an eminent
<HI>Minister</HI> coming to preach, casually, at a cer∣tain
<HI>Meeting-House,</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> and ha∣ving
forgotten his Bible, could not borrow
one in the whole Congregation, till, at last,
one poor Woman, by Accident, came in with
a Bible. So useless it is to examine or en∣quire
into what the <HI>Minister</HI> says, or to mi∣nute
down his Proofs, in Order to review
and reflect on what has been heard.</P>
<P>The Word of God is an inestimable Trea∣sure,
but we have it now in such Earthen
Vessels, that, really, the Treasure is made a
<PB N="330" REF="341" MS="y"/>
Jest for the sake of the Vessel, and the Vessel
makes a Jest of the Treasure and of himself
also, till they make the Sacrifice an Abomi∣nation,
and make the People abhor the Offer∣ing
of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Matters of Fact being thus touch'd
at, and, indeed, but touch'd at, for God
knows there is but too much Room for En∣largements,
it remains to enquire into the
Consequences of these Things, and these are
but too visible;</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Decay of Religion in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Decay of the <HI>Dissenting</HI> Interest
in particular.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>Let no Man wonder at the Number of
Youth, bred among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> for the Mi∣nistry,
that go over to the <HI>Church of England;</HI>
want of Learning will always be attended
with want of Principle, want of a Founda∣tion
will always betray Men to Temptation;
Foppish Pride, Unstay'd and Unsteady Tem∣per,
Native Levity, not ballanc'd by Judg∣ment,
not supported by a Fund of Know∣ledge,
will always nourish Prejudice, and
covet Changes.</P>
<P>The Young Men begin under two insu∣perable
Articles of Necessity, Want of
<HI>Learning,</HI> and want of <HI>Bread;</HI> they have an
Accomplishment most Inconsistent and Un∣suitable
to both, a Stock of Pride, and a Stock
<PB N="331" REF="342"/>
of Resentment: Let any one tell us from
which of these should they be furnish'd to
resist Temptation: Their want of Bread can∣not
assist them to refuse a good Living; want
of Learning can never fail to prompt them
to go over to a People, with whom it can
better be pass'd over, and who have
Country Livings to supply, where it can∣not
be discover'd; Pride will never prompt
a Man to be a <HI>Dissenter,</HI> where there is so
little Prospect of Encouragement, and so
little Room to Rise. Resentment is grati∣fy'd
to the highest Degree; for, by going
over, they have a full Occasion to fall upon
them that us'd them, as they think, with
so much Inequallity, and treated them so
haughtily.</P>
<P>Here begins the ill Blood that breaks out
as soon as they go off; and from hence
it is that we have nothing so bitter writ∣ten,
and said against the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as by
such of their young <HI>Ministers,</HI> who have,
for some Time, been bred, <HI>Anglice</HI> starv'd,
among them, and have gone off to the
<HI>Church,</HI> such as M—; N—; R—;
H—; Wessley; Robertson; Hasset; Palmer;
and others.</P>
<P>It may not be unworthy here of the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI>
Consideration in General, whether they
have not, on all Occasions, treated <HI>not these
People only,</HI> but all those that have been wil∣ling,
forward, and able too to serve their
<PB N="332" REF="343" MS="y"/>
Interest, with too much Slight and Neglect;
and some that have merited better from them
with <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>unjust Reproach:</HI> How this
should end in any Thing, but in Turning
the Hands against them that would other∣wise
have been employ'd for them, is hard
to imagine: Till they think fit to alter this,
they cannot expect to have many Defenders,
or ever to want furious Enemies: Nature is
born with Resentment, and when Men that
serve Faithfully, and hazard themselves Zea∣lously,
meet with Reproaches for Rewards,
and haughty contemptible Carriage instead
of Countenance and Encouragement; Passi∣on
will prevail to set them against the Peo∣ple
they otherwise would adhere to; every
Man cannot serve and starve for them: Let
those that think this Hint unjust, look
back on Mr. <HI>Delaune;</HI> let them ask Mr. <HI>Wess∣ley</HI>
why he conform'd; let them enquire of
poor <HI>Tutchin's</HI> Friends, and look upon the
Circumstances of his Widow and Family;
let them enquire of the Fate of <HI>Harry Care,</HI>
and how Want of being supported forc'd
him to submit to their Enemies; and let
them look round them for other Objects of
like Kind without Number.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Dissenters</HI> think their Case needs
no Champions, their Cause needs no Advo∣cates,
their Defence calls for no Assistance,
they would do well to think again; it is
much more certain that it wants no Ene∣mies.
<PB N="333" REF="344"/>
On the other Hand, Detecting the
Forgeries of their Adversaries, Answering
their innumerable Reproaches, Exposing
their Attempts to ruin them, and their At∣tacks
upon them, have, by all wise Men, and
who have a true Sense of their Interest, been
found to be of Service to them; and this
has set their Enemies, whose Eyes are al∣ways
open to it, at Work to tempt, to buy
off, and by all Means possible to draw away
such Helps from them; and in this they
have had too much Success, the Persons ha∣ving
been pinch'd with severe Circumstan∣ces
on one Hand; totally slighted, and neg∣lected
by the <HI>Dissenters</HI> on the other; and
closely besieg'd with Invitations, Promises,
and large Offers of Preferment and Support
by the Enemy; of this too many Examples
might be given to leave Room for any Ob∣jection:
And it is to be doubted the Time is
at Hand, when Experience will speak too
plainly that this has been a great Mistake in
the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> whether they will mend it
or no, Time must inform us.</P>
<P>This Tract will not afford Room to be lar∣ger
upon these Things, and therefore it has
only touch'd the Particulars in a summary
Way, without Entring Historically into the
Matters of Fact; it is presum'd the Sugge∣stions
are uncontestable, and the Consequen∣ces
drawn so just as to admit very little
Objection. However, if any Body thinks
<PB N="334" REF="345"/>
fit to object, the Field is wide, he may begin
when he pleases.</P>
<P>It seems to remain that the Complainer
should propose what Remedy is proper in
these Things. Many can find a Fault to
one that can mend it, he only is a wise Re∣prover
who Reproves for a Reformation;
yet this is not difficult: The greatest Obsta∣cle
appears in Convincing the <HI>Dissenters</HI> of
the Error. Few will believe the Mischief
is true, or that such Evils are upon them.
This Method is taken, private Admonitions
having been in vain offer'd, to convince them
of the Fact; it is for them to consider of Re∣medies.
Those Remedies are easy: As a
Man's Sin is sometimes read in his Punish∣ment,
so Remedies are directed by the Dis∣eases.</P>
<P>Particularly in the Conduct of their
Fund, and Breeding up their Ministers:
Would they calculate their Stock, and take
in no more than they can <HI>Maintain,</HI> they
would soon see a Difference: <HI>By maintain</HI> is
meant, 1. maintain at the Schools a compleat
Time, that they might not be thrust out
unfinish'd, and mount the <HI>Pulpit</HI> before they
are fit for the Desk; and 2. maintain after∣wards
till they may be provided for.</P>
<P>Every Boy the <HI>Blue-Coat Hospital</HI> brings
up, they put out Apprentice when they
have done with him at School; when he
comes out of his Time they know he cannot
<PB N="335" REF="346"/>
Work without Tools, or set up without
Help, their Care is therefore not at an End
till they have supply'd him to set up the
Trade; and then, if he cannot Live he may
Starve, he deserves no Pity.</P>
<P>But our Young Ministers are turn'd loose
like Vagrants to seek their Fortunes. When
they are something less than half taught
their Business, then they are left naked with∣out
Help to compleat the rest, or act for
themselves; if you would have the FUND
raise Ministers, Ministers fit for the Work,
Ministers that shall cleave to you, and not
fly in your Faces, Ministers you shall not
be asham'd of, and that will not be asham'd
of you; take in about one Fifth of the
Number you now take in, and fix your
Number to the Strength of your Fund, not
to go beyond it; when you are press'd to
take a Youth, in respect to the Circumstan∣ces
of his Parents or Family, (keep a Part of
the Stock ready for that Work) give Ten
Pounds to put him out Apprentice to a <HI>Shooe∣maker</HI>
or a <HI>Barber,</HI> or any Thing, and reserve
20<HI>l.</HI> to set him up, make him any thing but a
Minister, tho' it were a <HI>Chimney-Sweeper;</HI>
but to make him a Minister, you both ruin
the Boy, and make him help to starve and
ruin the rest.</P>
<P>When you have a Set Number, such as
your Fund can keep, let them be kept as
they should be; let them have due Inspectors
<PB N="336" REF="347"/>
over their Morals and Capacities, that it
may be known early, whether a Lad will
best make a Minister or a Porter, an In∣structor
of others, or a due Member of the
House of Correction; whether he is likeliest
for the Pulpit or the Gallows; for such are
among us, and will always be; do this,
and you need not be at Charges to no Pur∣pose,
bestowing just enough to spiol them
for one, and fit them for t'other.</P>
<P>If he has a Genius, if he applies, if he is
sober, diligent and capable, nourish him, sup∣ply
him with Books, and give him Time;
at least Twelve Years Study should be al∣low'd
to finish a Minister; if he shines sooner
you will see the Light, and you may give
him Leave to appear Abroad; if he is other∣wise,
if he proves a Blockhead, or a Rake,
dismiss him early, that he may go to a Trade,
and avoid his Destruction. When your
Young Student comes Abroad, do not starve
him, but allow him a competent Mainte∣nance
till he is settled and provided for:
Then he would have no Need to ply as
before, and solicit for Work, a thing too
much below the Dignity of his Offce; if he
was wanted to preach, he would be found
in his Study, and the longer it was before
he was provided, the better he would act
when he came in.</P>
<P>What if the Expence of this lessen'd your
Number, and you bred up one to five, nay,
<PB N="337" REF="348"/>
to Fifteen of those that now consume the
Charity of your People, that ONE would
be a Man, and a Minister, and would do
more Good than the Fifteen. The fewer
you breed up, the fewer Beggars you would
have; the fewer Honest Men you would
ruin; the fewer you would bring up to be
starv'd; and the fewer Rennegado's you
would make, to fall upon you again in their
turn, and Reproach you and the whole Party
with your ill Usage of them.</P>
<P>If 500<HI>l.</HI> now raises you five Young Mini∣sters,
and you spent that 500<HI>l.</HI> all upon One,
that One would be a <HI>Clarkson,</HI> or a <HI>Charnock,</HI>
a Bullwark to <HI>Religion,</HI> an Honour to the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> a Champion to the <HI>Cause,</HI> while
the other Method brings five Conceited,
Brain-proud Youths into the World to Dis∣grace
the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> Offend the Sincere Professors
of <HI>Religion,</HI> and afford Laughter and Mockery
to your <HI>Enemies,</HI> Thus the Charity of your
People is misapply'd, the Young Men ruin'd,
the Work of the <HI>Ministry</HI> banter'd and expos'd,
the People Fed with Froth, and <HI>Whipt-Crea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
instead of the <HI>Sound Milk</HI> of the <HI>Word; Reli∣gion</HI>
becomes a Jest, and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> will, if
this be not Reform'd, be the Hissing and Scoff
of the Nation: God guide you all to apply a
speedy Remedy to it, or to throw up the
Cause of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and leave it to the
Lord of the Harvest, to send forth such La∣bourers
as he shall choose, with out your help.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O Conclude this Unpleasant
but Necessary Part, I cannot
but recommend some Things
to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> which shall
close the Whole, and which
I think greatly concerns
them. <HI>First,</HI> That however the Service of God,
in the Ministry, is under Discouragements;
and among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> their Ministers may
expect <HI>Contempt, Reproach, Persecution,</HI> and
to be confin'd to mean <HI>Circumstances;</HI> yet
as the Employ is honourable, and merits
to be honour'd, they would not Dishonour it
so much, as to think it below Breeding up
those Children to it, when they have Eftates
to give them. It seems to me to argue great
Indifferency to, and unconcernedness in the
Interest of Religion, that few of our Chil∣dren
should be brought up to the Work of a
Minister, but those who have not Bread to
Eat, and must be furnish'd by the Charity of
the <HI>Dissenters;</HI> and this in a Day when that
<PB N="339" REF="350"/>
<HI>Charity</HI> runs so low, and is in danger of be∣ing
yet lower.</P>
<P>It may be faid, without reflecting, in the
least, upon any now in the Ministry, that,
did the Rich Part of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> breed up
their Children to be Ministers, equally with
the Poor, so that those Young Men, so bred
up, had Subsistance of their own to depend
upon, whereby all the Mischiefs touch'd at
before, would be avoided, and they could
take due time to furnish, and finish them∣selves
before they ventur'd upon so awful a
Work you would see a Change in your
Affairs, and the Reputation; of the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
would rise in proportion; for nothing casts
so great a Contempt upon any People, as a
Contemptible Clergy.</P>
<P>I know the Spirit of God is not confin'd
to study Learning, length of Time, or any
Human Means. But even thosse who are most
apt to lay stress upon the Efficiency of the
Spirit, without helps of Letters, Study, and
Application, will not pretend that these Helps
are a Hinderance to that Spirit: But we are
speaking now of the Interest, as it resect the
Times, and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as a Party; in which
the want of these outward Means has produc'd
such Mischievous Effects among us; That
Breach would be heal'd, if all our Ministers
were rais'd of such who had at least some
Competent Subsistence to depend upon, to
prevent the mean Hackneying themselves
<PB N="340" REF="351"/>
about for Bread, which takes them off from
following the Outward helps of Learning, or
a Retirement suited to that Application to
their Work, which is absolutely necessary to
its Success. And why should a Man think
a Thousand Pound, if he can give it to a Son,
ill-bestow'd to make him a Minister of the
Gospel, while we see Ladies of much greater
Fortunes think it not thrown away upon
such, though they have not oftentimes any
Foundation of their own?</P>
<P>It were very happy for a Young Minister,
if he had 50 or 60<HI>l. per Annum</HI> of his own,
that if he is called to a middling Stipend, he
may not refuse God's Work for want of sus∣ficient
Maintenance; that Ministers may not
stand at catch, and form Parties, even to In∣triegues,
to get into this or that Congre∣gation;
that they may not forsake their
Flocks when fix'd, upon the mean Considera∣tion
of a better Sallary: This would be the
way to spread the Dissenting Ministry into
the remotest Corners, and have the Gospel
preach'd without mercenary Aims, or cove∣teous
Desires: A thousand happy Things
would be the Consequence of this Practice;
the Ministers of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> would support
the Majesty of the Office, become truly Re∣verend,
and restore the Character those of
the last Age have lest behind them; not that
the Money would alone do it: But the many
scandalous Mischiefs which now unavoidably
<PB N="341" REF="352"/>
follow, the Introduction of <HI>Beggars</HI> and <HI>Alms-People</HI>
into the Ministry would be prevented
most effectually by it, and the rest would fol∣low
of Course.</P>
<P>Nay, were this once the Practice none but
Men of Substance would be thought Compe∣tent;
for the other not being able to sit them∣selves
for the Work, for want of Stock, would
not make the Attempt; or if they did, would
come to nothing: And so let it be; Let <HI>Beg∣gars</HI>
be bred to the Ax and the Hammer;
let the <HI>Poor</HI> be left to Labour; those that
are to be set a-part for God should not be
singled out of those that could not have
Bread to Eat: Indeed, if it were a National
Church, where Publick Provision was made
for the Introduction of Ministers, and legal
Stipends appointed, when they were call'd,
something might be said.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are stated, it is quite
another Case; in many Places, Preaching
the Gospel is al most a Work of <HI>Charity</HI> to
the People: How shall the Promise of our Sa∣viour
be accomplish'd, <HI>that the Poor have the
Gospel preach'd to them,</HI> while we Invert the
Sentence, and say, <HI>By the Poor is the Gospel
preached,</HI> and while our Ministers are the
Product of our Charity? What Awe, what
Reverence, will these beget who Preach for
Bread, in the grosest Sence, that are even <HI>bred
up</HI> to Preach for <HI>Bread.</HI> These, truly, make
<HI>Religion a Trade; the Pulpit</HI> is their Shop, and
<PB N="342" REF="353"/>
their <HI>Schooling</HI> their Apprenticeship, though
they often set up without Stock, or Tools to
Work with.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Dissenters</HI> ever will restore their
Figure in the World, it must be by restoreing
their Ministry; and this will never be done,
while they themselves have so Contemptible
an Opinion of the Ministry, that whoever
can give his Son 500 I. to begin the World,
will Scorn to thro' him away upon the <HI>Office;</HI>
and would think it a ruin to him, to make
him a Minister: Whereas, on the Contrary,
a Thousand Pound is as little as can be be∣stowed
to Set out a Man for that Work, so
as to be an Honour to the Office of a Mini∣ster,
or Capable of being helpful to the In∣terest
of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and to keep himself,
and that Interest, from Contempt. I am in
hopes some among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> already see
this Error, and a few there are who have at∣tempted
to mend it: We see some Honest Men
Dedicating their Posterity to the Work of the
Ministry, to whom they can give Honourable
Maintenance; but the Number of these are
Few, and the Admonition I hope is not in
Vain: All Men who have any Respect for the
Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> wish they may be
Supply'd with such Persons as may be an Hon∣our
to Religion, and may bear the Weight of
their Interest in this World, as well as propa∣gate
the Work of the Gospel for the Next.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="354"/>
I hope none of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> will suggest
from this Discourse, that I do not allow there
are many very good, well finish'd, and most
excellent Men among the Ministers of the
<HI>Dissenters,</HI> altho; as on the one Side, to avoid
Disscouraging and Exposing some, so, on the
other Side, to avoid Flattery and Panegy∣rick,
I have left Names entirely out of this
Discourse: I acknowledge the Merit of these,
and shall, on all Occasions, study to do them
Justice; I reverence their Persons, and put a
double Value upon them, by how much I
lament the Paucity of their Number; I
prav that they may be encreas'd, and the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> bless'd with such a Ministry as
may preserve, encrease, and esablish the In∣terest
of true Religion and Godliness among
them: But, on the other Hand, I appeal to
these very Ministers for the Truth and
Justice of what I have written, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe∣ther
there is not a sad Defection among the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in this Case; Whether, if a Re∣form
be not made, their Interest must not
inevitably sink; and to this End these
Sheets are written, and no other. To say it
exposes the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> is to say nothing; I
am sure the Mischies will not expose them
only, but ruin them; let it be amended; it
will be no Reproach to them to Correct their
own Mistakes: Their Enemies dread the Re∣formation
of it, and triumph, Daily, in the
Thoughts of its being impossible to be reco∣ver'd
<PB N="344" REF="355"/>
but, <HI>Nil Desperandum,</HI> I hope still they
will be awaken'd to see the Mistake, and to
apply the proper Antidote to the Poison.</P>
<P>Nor do I, in this, object against our Acca∣demies
as such, or as incapable of Finishing
the Youth sent thither, in their Studies, or
Quallifying them for the Work of the <HI>Mini∣stry,</HI>
would those but allow Time for the Per∣formance.
I own the Tutors are under Dis∣couragements,
which the Circumstances of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> render unavoidable; but this is
not the Complaint. The Want of Time, the
ill Choice of the Youth, and the unhappy
Crowd thrust in: Those are the Foundations
of all the Evil, <HI>of which as before,</HI> and this is
what every one will own may be remedy'd.</P>
<P>2. It remains now to enquire into the State
of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as it now stands, and as it
respects their politick Interest under the new
Alteration of their Circumstances, of which
the Historical Part is related in the foregoing
Sheet; and what is their present Work, as
their Affairs are now scituated.</P>
<P>Since the Writing of the foregoing Sheets,
the <HI>Occasional Bill</HI> takes Place, and the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI>
continuing such, are universally shut
out from Places, Posts of Honour, Profit,
Trust, Magistracy, and the like; I know
there are Ways and Means how to evade
this Act, and avoid the Force of it, and a
few, for a short Time, may shift and shuffle
with it; of which I need say no more than
<PB N="345" REF="356"/>
this; all these Things will extend but to a
few, and last those few but a little while:
The main Body of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in Places
must expect either to quit one or the other;
and I wonder, I confese, to find it so much a
Question among them which they should
do; I hope the Time is coming when it
shall be no more a Question, and when Pla∣ces,
Profits, Preferments, and Honours, shall
no more stand in Competition with Con∣science,
to the Ruin of the Character, Sin∣cerity,
Morals, and Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
in this Nation. This Sincerity, and the
steady Adhering to the Truth of their Prin∣ciples
is that which will bring Meat out of
this Eater, and will effectually restore the
Reputation of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> make their In∣terest
Formidable to their Enemies, Glori∣ous
to the <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> and give the
greatest Blow to their Enemies who have
contrived this late Oppression for their Mor∣tisication
that can possibly be given.</P>
<P>This leads me to an Observation which I
think is visible from the Premises, and
which, as it is yet but in Prospect, I have re∣serv'd
for this Place, as a Conclusion to this
Work, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Enemy aforesaid will, in
the End, be entirely disappointed in their
Expectations, as to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> from the
late Restraint laid by them upon <HI>Occasional
Conformity:</HI> That altho' it is a very great
Blow to the <HI>Dissenter's</HI> Interest for the pre∣sent
<PB N="346" REF="357"/>
and seems to threaten them with a
Breaking of their Party. Subjecting them to
their Enemies, and Establishing those Ene∣mies
in the Oppressive Power they have so
long labour'd to obtain over the <HI>Dissenters;</HI>
Just the contrary shall be the Effect, to their
Astonishment, and at last, to the Confusion of
those Mad-men, and of their Interest in this
Nation.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Dissenters</HI> must give me Leave
to add one Thing, by Way of Caution, which
I hope shall be back'd with Reason and Cha∣rity,
<HI>viz.</HI> Always provided that the <HI>Dissent∣ers</HI>
shall, as I hope they will, alter their
Measures, revive the Antient Federal Prin∣ciples
of Love, Union, and Concert among
and to one another, that they open their
Hands and enlarge their Principles: I mean
of Charity and Bounty to those who are
ready to suffer and sacrifice themselves sor
their Cause, and in Defence of Truth; that
they neither drive their Depending Brethren
from them, or discourage others from Em∣bracing
a Suffering Party and Cause.</P>
<P>I cannot but recommend to the <HI>Dissenters</HI>
in <HI>England</HI> a certain wonderfully useful Pa∣per,
publish'd by their Enemy, the <HI>Post-Boy,</HI>
here, and particularly the Original, exhibi∣ted
by a Rank of as inveterate Enemies to
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> as any in Her Majesty's Do∣minions;
and this is the Representation of
the Convocation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> publish'd in
<PB N="347" REF="358"/>
<HI>Dublin,</HI> and sent over to Her Majesty. The
<HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> may learn from this
Paper, what it is alone that will make them
formidasble to their Enemies, encrease their
Number, and confirm their Interest. The
<HI>Convocation</HI> complain heavily of the grow∣ing
Numbers of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI>
especally of <HI>Ireland: They lament bow for∣midable
they are to the Establish'd Church,
and the Necessity there is to crush and restrain
them, for Fear of the Overthrow of the Church;
and the Arguments are very forcible, as it must
be confess'd: They are principally drawn from
the Diligence of their Ministers in Spreading
their Poison,</HI> (so they call Preaching a <HI>Pro∣testant</HI>
Doctrine) <HI>the universal Harmony and
Concert in all their Proceedings, one which a∣nother;
their Raising great Funds to propa∣gate
their Interesly Supporting and Encourag∣ing
their own Party and Poor; and which is
still worse, their Adhering to one another in
Matters of Commerce, Trading with one ano∣ther,
and Employing one another, exclusive of
the Churchmen, whereby</HI> (say they) <HI>they with
too much Succsss, establish the Faction,</HI> that is
their own <HI>Interest,</HI> and enrich themselves to
such a Degree as is dangerous to the Church,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I omit Repeating the rest of their Argu∣ments,
tho' many of them are of the like Kind,
but the Use of it is this, that here, as in a
Glass, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> may see
<PB N="348" REF="359"/>
what is their present Work, what the Duty
of their Profession, relatively consider'd, is, and
what alone can restore their Circumstances,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have their Eye a little more
to the general Good of their own Body than
ever yet they have had; laying aside selfish
Principles,, Diffidence, and Distrust of one
another; and act as a Body in Concert with
one another; taking proper Steps to raise
and recover a Confidence in one another,
and a general Concern for their Common
and Universal Interest: As a strict, up∣right,
steddy Adhering <HI>to the Principles</HI> of
the <HI>Dissenters</HI> will give them a Reputation
all over the World, and even with their
Enemies, and will restore them to the good
Opinion, <HI>not of one another only,</HI> but of all
the World; so a strict Adhering <HI>to the In∣terest</HI>
of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and Restoring a true
publick Spirit among them, will raise their
politick Reputation to such a Degree as it
never yet could arrive to, and make them
too considerable in the World, to be used as
some People expect to use them. This ne∣cessarily
requires some Explication, and with
that I shall conclude this Discourse.</P>
<P>The Circumstances of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> as to
the late <HI>Occasional-Bill,</HI> has been already
hinted at, and is well known to the World:
What has brought them to it, is sufficiently
spoken to in the foregoing Sheets: <HI>The Que∣sion
now is,</HI> What is like to be the Conse∣quence
<PB N="349" REF="360"/>
of these Things? In which I think
a Man need not search deep, but he will
evidently see these Things.</P>
<P>1. That their Enemies expect their Ruin.</P>
<P>2. That if they manage rightly, the very
Mischief design'd them, may yet be to
their Advantage.</P>
<P>I am far from Defending, or Approving
what is done against them; neither the Po∣licy
or the Morallity of it can be justisy'd.
But what shall the <HI>Dissenters</HI> do? What is
before them? My Hints shall be short; their
Way is easy; and they will all own the
Reasonableness of the Proposal.</P>
<P><HI>Repent and do their first Works; Occasio∣nal
Conformity</HI> has been the Ruin of their
Interest; let it now be evident to the World,
that <HI>Conscientious Nonconfomity</HI> is their true
Foundation; let all that can conform, leave
them, and go over to the Church. To the
Churchbmen I will say, <HI>take them,</HI> and much
Good may they do you: We believe you
have little to boast of the <HI>Ecclesiasstical Con∣verts</HI>
you have made from the <HI>Dissenters:</HI>
Ye dare not give us a List of them, and bid
us write their Characters, and then value
your selves upon them: If no better go over
than are yet gone, I mean among the <HI>Mini∣sters</HI>
of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> the <HI>Dissenting Interest</HI>
will never feel the Loss, or <HI>Church</HI> be
able to count their Gain: Nor is there one
True bred <HI>Dissenter</HI> to be found among the
<PB N="350" REF="361"/>
Converts of the last Ten Years; none but
the Fund-bred, Half-taught Sons of <HI>Charity,</HI>
of whom I have spoken before, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such as
help'd to be a Scandal to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> when
they were among them, and will be so to
whomsoever they shall joyn; such as had
not the Education of <HI>Ministers</HI> among the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> been under the unhappy Discou∣ragements
aforesaid you had never had, and
if new Measures are taken by the <HI>Dissenters,</HI>
in the Education of their <HI>Ministers,</HI> you will
get very few more.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> I say, be not concern'd
at these Men leaving you; let them go, and
I wish many more which might be nam'd
would go after them. The Remainder re∣fin'd
from this Dross, purg'd from these
Dreggs, clear'd of this Scum, would shine the
clearer; Preaching the Gospel would revive
among us; these fashionable <HI>Ministers,</HI> really,
know not what <HI>Preaching the Gospel means;</HI>
they are so afraid of what was called <HI>Cant,</HI>
that they hardly preserve the Gravity of Stile
in the Pulpit, nay, they altogether shun the
Energy and Force of acceptable Words, and
rather study to make a fine Oration than a
plain honest Sermon: So florid they would
be thought to be, that they affect a Dram∣matick
Stile in their Sermons, and bring our
Play-House Phrases into the Language of the
Pulpit, and this they call <HI>Fine Preachings,</HI> of
which I shall give you the just Censure of a
<PB N="351" REF="362"/>
very worthy and able Judge, Mr. <HI>Alsop,</HI> who
even the <HI>Dissnters</HI> Enemies would allow had
as much Wit, and as good Language, as most
Men in his Time. He us'd to say, <HI>Soft, Gay
Words and Satyrical Expressions were the two
Extreams of Language, and both became a
Writer, but not a Preacher;</HI> and when one told
him he had heard a certain Man preach a
<HI>Fine Seomon: A Fine Sermon! says</HI> Mr. <HI>Al∣sop
a Sermon of the</HI> Devil; <HI>this fine Preach∣ing
will ruin the</HI> Dissenters. Indeed, Mr.
<HI>Alsop</HI> Has prov'd too true a Prophet.</P>
<P>Plainness in Stile, affectionate Delivery,
Preach'd with a Concern for Souls, and with
a Reverence Suitable to the Majesty of the
Work. These were the Things Recommen∣ded
the Gospel to the last Age; and this must
still be said, tho' the Taste of this Age is
Debauch'd by the Frothy <HI>Fluttering,</HI> Empty
<HI>Pulpit-Talk,</HI> which is Cryed up for the <HI>Fine
Preaching</HI> of the Day, as before; yet if a true
Primitive Gospel Preacher happens, from
some remote Corner, to rise among us, <HI>as One
from the Dead,</HI> and puts us in mind of the
Manner of our Ancestors, the Excellency is so
Intrinsick, and the Power is so Irrisistible, that
it must Force our Approbation; and it does so;
<HI>but then</HI> the People are under a Surprize; they
are affected with it as a kind of Miracle, and
they enquire as Men amaz'd; <HI>just as the Jews,
in another Case;</HI> is not this such and such a
Man? Does he not come out of <HI>Devonshire,
<PB N="352" REF="363" MS="y"/>
or Wales, or Lancashire, or Scotland? Whence
had this Man these Gifts?</HI> Would God in
Mercy to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> send among them a
few such Preachers, as Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> Mr. <HI>John
Collins,</HI> Dr. <HI>Manton,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Richard,</HI> and
<HI>Joseph Allen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gilpin,</HI> Mr.
Mead, and the like, how would they restore
the Taste of the Hearers of the Town, and
cause us to Nauceat the Levity and Cold
Declaiming of the Preachers, now rising up
among us. If he hath any more Harvest to
Reap in this Vineyard, he will certainly find
Labourers more Suitable, and therefore we
may hope he will in Time do this; but if
the Present Spirit remain both among Mini∣sters
and Hearers, I fear this Dreadful Pro∣phesie
of a Deceased Minister among the
<HI>Dissenters</HI> may take Effect in our Age, <HI>(viz.)
That either God will remove this</HI> Generation
<HI>from the Gospel, or the Gospel from</HI> this Ge∣neration.</P>
<BIBL>Mat. XIX. 25.</BIBL>
<P>Smite a Scorner, and the Simple will be
ware, and Reproach a Man of Understanding
and be will understand Knowledge.</P>
