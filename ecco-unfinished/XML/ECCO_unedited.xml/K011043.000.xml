<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. PALMER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>THE Comic Muse, tho' privelig'd to wear</L>
<L>A mask on her own face, strips others bare,</L>
<L>And whilst she gives all nature to your view,</L>
<L>Shall not her mirror shew th' Impostor too?</L>
<L>For tho' most knaves in this ingenious age</L>
<L>Out-trick the law, we trap them on the stage:</L>
<L>But then some poets make their knaves so witty,</L>
<L>That when they pluck their vizors off, you pity.</L>
<L>Now that's a fault of poets dead and gone,</L>
<L>Our bard has kept his conscience clear for one;</L>
<L>Indulge his knave in a few roguish fallies,</L>
<L>To call him witty wou'd be down right malice;</L>
<L>His bitterest enemies, with all their railing,</L>
<L>Are well dispos'd to'acquit him of that failing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time was indeed, but that good time is past,</L>
<L>When novelties did not grow old so fast:</L>
<L>Woe to the piece, tho' st first sight 'twere striking,</L>
<L>If second sight steps in and mars your liking!</L>
<L>Like a new face, it glitters for a day,</L>
<L>All run, crow'd, follow; slare—and turn away.</L>
<L>Love hath it's honey-moon, but, that once o'er,</L>
<L>From sweet to flat, from flat it turns to sour;</L>
<L>Cross follows cool, as cool succeeds to civil,</L>
<L>My duck! my darling! once, and then—My devil!</L>
<L>Ev'n Wit's fine edge is dull'd by too much wearing,</L>
<L>And truths twice told will tire us in the hearing:</L>
<L>The Orator, that tries his lungs too often,</L>
<L>Will set the lungs of other men a coughing;</L>
<L>No sooner up, than strait all parties join</L>
<L>In one unanimous resolve—to dine;</L>
<L>The lessening senate melts away by drops;</L>
<L>And metaphors are left for mutton-chops.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How then? If novelties be so uncertain,</L>
<L>Sad news for our old friend behind the curtain,</L>
<L>Whose Muse has push'd her helicon about</L>
<L>So quick, we almost fear the tap is out:</L>
<L>If truth, wit, eloquence are but a Jest,</L>
<L>How shou'd a mere <HI>Impostor</HI> stand the test?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'll give the Bramble's answer to the Oak,</L>
<L>Small sticks will blaze, when great ones only smoake.</L>

<P>Most valorous and renowned cap∣tain, give me your hand. How fares it, my brave fellow?</P>

<P>Merry and wise too, or I have that name for nothing. I warrant now you have had your turn upon the terrace, pacing up and down to the measure of your old quarter deck—isn't it so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, habit is every thing. Is your noble guest the Viscount Janus stirring yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet, not yet: I am waiting here to give his lordship the good morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must n't wait much longer let me tell you, or it will be mid-day before his morning's be∣gun: give him a good rowze instead of it and pipe all hands to breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kind of manners wou'd that be, friend George? We must have no rowzing nor piping here; no such sea noises with a nobleman of his high birth and breeding. Where are all my fellows? Where is Oliver?</P>

<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here am I, your worship; here is Oliver.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a precious Hotten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot you have made of yourself: Is that a trim to wait upon a lord in? Go, get you gone, you lazy whelp, and let me see you in your new livery; slip on your other skin, and then present my compliments to Lord Janus and beg to know how he has rested.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chearly, my good fellow! dowse your soul weather flag and hoist your holidays colours in ho∣nour of the occasion.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, if it must be so, it must, your wor∣ship; but I'd as soon be set in the pillory as foisted into that new fangled doublett.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And hark ye, Sir, a word with you—Let me hear no more of your worship; leave off your quarter-sessions cant, and speak to me in a language such as well-bred ears are us'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how forsooth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is: when you speak of me, let it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by my proper stile and title, Sir Solomon Sapient;
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
when you speak to me, simple Sir Solomon will suf∣fice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simple Sir Solomon, it shall suffice.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Oliver.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Czar Peter was not more plagu'd to trim the beards and whiskers of his Muscovites, than I to trim these clod-pated bumpkins out of their long skirts and pudding-cuffs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after all do you think 'em worth the pains? Surely my friend Oliver is at least a match for Monsieur Philibert, the little ugly Jew-like fellow, that calls himself Lord Janus's valet de-chambre. His-lordship's suite is not very splendid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, George; you say true; Lord Janus does not affect pomp; he travels as it were in∣cognito. His lordship at this distance from the capital may be liken'd to a comet in the extremity of its orbi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he approaches to the point of his attraction he will send forth a shining and a brilliant train: Lord Janus is a man of speculation and enquiry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shou'dn't you be a man of enquiry too-brother Solomon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where wou'd your wisdom send me to enquire? Of Collins's Peerage? I have his pedigree by heart; I can trace him from the heptarchy; his very title of Janus proves the circumspection of his ancestors; 'tis as much as to say they had all their eyes about 'em: his armorial bearings are typical of sagacity; two vizors in a wreath of serpents: his sup∣porters are an allegory; on the dexter side a fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> denoting cunning; on the sinister a goose, which is the emblem of wariness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you wou'd take a lesson from that wary goose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take a lesson from no goose, nor go to one for counsel, so pr'y thee spare your pains in ad∣vising me; why will you concern yourself in a business, that is out of your line? why will you be thrusting in your oar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twou'd not be the first I've handled by a pretty many, if I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then keep to your element, dear George, keep to your element, the boisterous ocean: you have not made human nature your study; you have not been in the world as I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been round it, brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there's the case, you have peei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the orange but not tasted the fruit. I am the man, the happy man, who when I first set eyes upon this noble peer, intuitively develop'd all the latent virtues of his heart; and now you shall know, George, that I ex∣pect his lordship to propose for Eleanor out of hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why don't you doubt it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because my niece will have a fine fortune, and what is more is a very fine girl.</P>

<P>The old girl swallows the bait glibly, does she not?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L, Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder when you butter it so un∣mercifully; how is it you can keep your countenance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask rather how my countenance keeps me; I owe it many a good turn at a hard pinch, and now methinks 'tis high time to marry and be honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold there, friend Jack! it we are both to play the same game, he that's first up may chance to spoil the other's hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Content yourself about that and tho' you are Horry Singieton every where e'se you shall be Lord Janus here, and have all your privileges of being first serv'd; then I hope your humble servant may have leave to help himself: Fair Eleanor is the dith of dainties at the head of the table; plain Dorothy is the piece de resistance at the foot of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough said! if that be so I am con∣tent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Commend me to your modesty for that: 'foregad I think the man that takes dame Dorothy's person will have fairly earned her purfe: sarangle me if I wou'd be plagu'd with her, but that I began to think a little snug retreat would be seasonable, some little property that I may fairly call my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That might prevent mistakes to be sure; if you had property of your own, you need not trouble other people for their's so often as you have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; hitherto I have only had right of common upon the wide world; marriage is like a bill of enclosure, by which every man has his own lot to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and he may keep it to himself so long as he can fence out his neighbours; but that is not often the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dorothy will be a good stake in my hedge however; he, that breaks into her pasture, must risque more in the attack, than he can profit by the trespass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess there is enough to baulk a bolder sportsman than I pretend to be; but keep your eye upon Sir Solomon; he is lord of the manor here, and if nobody claims Dorothy, she and her strong box will fall as an escheat to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will take care of his daughter, I think I may promise to provide for Dorothy, and thus between us we may give him a sine-cure for the rest of his days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when all his caree are over, I will quietly lay down my peerage, retire from the gaieties of the world, and live like a plain country gentleman do this plain country house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess you will prefer it for your summer residence to Janus Castle itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I shall put that aside as a jointure-house for my lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right! we will keep that snug in the red box with the rest of the deeds, which Sir Solomon has taken charge of; if it escapes out of his hands, let him look to the loss; it is not our business to disturb such quiet property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after all what say you to Solomon? is he not a precious fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like him better than I do that same Cap∣tain Bluff; I don't know what to think of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never think about him; those web∣footed fowl are nimble on the water, but mere wad∣dlers upon land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what for a girl is Miss Eleanor the heiress?</P>

<P>What are we about then? If we are loyera, let as follow up the fair.

<P>I know your family full well; a very anti∣ent and respectable house; I have the honor to rank next to you, Sir Charles, upon the roll of baronets.

<P>I am overpaid, Sir Solomon, by my great good fortune in chancing upon this young lady as I was travelling the road, just where her horse begun a plunging; by a sudden spring from the back of mine I caught her in my arms as she was falling, and seiz∣ing hold of her rein at the same time held the mis∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>evous animal fast by the head, till I bad extricated her foot from the stirrup; and now give me leave to remark to you, Sir Solomon, that had I a life so pre∣cious in my charge I shou'd hold myself u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ardonable, were I to expose it to such danger any more.</P>

<P>We have other travellers in the same pre∣dicament with yourself; perhaps you may be ac∣quainted with the noble personage, who now honors me with his company; perhaps you know the Lord Viscount Janus.</P>

<P>Intimately, I know him intimately and honor him very highly, as every man, who knows him, must.</P>

<P>Mind that, daughter Eleanor: He has a very fine fortune I understand—</P>

<P>Pardon me, I do not speak of his un∣derstanding in that stile; he is much too modest and well-bred to affect the man of wit and acuteness; he is of the gentlest manners and diffident almost to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> failing—</P>

<P>If I am to judge of it by Lord Janus, I confess I do not.</P>

<P>I assure you it is too apt to intercept his good qualities and keep them out of sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sir Charles Freemantle, I do not see that failing in Lord Janus in the degree you mention; his lordship has a fluency of expression, a very happy command of his features, a ready address in setting himself off to advantage, as indeed it well becomes him to do; but he makes no display of his fortune, he his above that; no equipage, no suite of servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's much indeed; for in general his lordship is very splendid in those respects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas a-day, he has nobody with him but old Philibert the Frenchman, and he looks more like a Jew than any thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprise me much; I can't think where he has pick'd up such a person: I can remem∣ber he had a very smart fellow in that capacity, one Harry Singleton, a mighty favourite; but as I had no opinion of his honesty I always thought his reign wou'd be a short one</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Sir Charles, if you will honor me with your company, you will have the pleasure of meeting an old acquaintance, and confer a great favor upon a new one.</P>

<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a volume let me tell you, that has lain a pretty many years on the shelf, and you will find a pretty many crabbed pages in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beauty, Sir Solomon, is the fairest page in the manuscript of the creation; a scholar seeks for what he may admire in it; a booby looks about for what he may find fault with: one feeds like a bee upon blossoms, the other like a beetle upon dirt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour I conceive my cousin is not very beautiful, nor yet very young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly she is neither, and yet there is a something, give me leave to say, a kind of <HI>je'n scais <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uois</HI> about her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you mean her fortune; there in∣deed she has some temptations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for me, not for me; I despise fortune; riches are my contempt, therefore with your leave we will drop the subject, and apply to something more immediate: You must know, Sir Solomon, I have sketcht out an abstract of his lordship's propos'd set∣tlement upon your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well done, Mr. Polycarp; that is very much to the purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis noble, 'tis magnificent; perhaps I thought it so in the extreme, but I acted from duty, be from generosity, and so it stands without retrench∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>My deposit with my daughter is 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, and the residue at my death without hei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it is, and shall be glad to see the transaction clos'd between his lordship and you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any doubt then of his standing to his engagement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far be it from me to say that, but I have seen one marriage settlement broke off from the dila∣tory proceedings of the lawyers: Lord Janus is a young man; his passions are warm, and 'tis the nature of such tempers to be a little volatile: Were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in your case I
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
shou'd not let him out of my sight; I should marry him on the spot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be done with security to the parties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very easily; let him sign the abstract I have prepared, which effectually binds him to the settlement, and pay you the 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> into his hands, and the af∣fair is done: The marriage takes place immediately, and your daughter is the Lady Viscountess Janus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you sure his lordship's signing that abstract is good security for the settlement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure it is as good as any settlement he can make, or any security you can have, tho' his whole estate were bound to make it good: I am your friend, Sir Solomon, in this business: I am indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mr. Polycarp, I am everlastingly bound to you: my money is forthcoming, if he is but as ready on his part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I will be answerable for him: But how stands the young lady's inclinations all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol</SPEAKER>
<P>And how shou'd you suppose a young lady's inclinations likely to stand from the sample you have had in this family of an old one's?</P>

<P>Ah, Sir Solomon, you're a wag. No more of that if you love me.</P>

<P>WELL, my Lord Janus, these are very generous proposals; I cannot hesitate about them; I only doubt if Janus Castle will not be too expensive an establishment for a jointure house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a substantial edifice, and in good repair; I can't complain of my expences in keeping it up.</P>

<P>I should wonder if you did.</P>

<P>Your disappointment will soon overtake 'em.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is not the splendor of your lordship's alliance, which dazzles my ambition; 'tis from the virtue of your character I derive my felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear that, my lord; little does Sir So∣lomon value your nobility, birth and fortune—and in∣deed what are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, what indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say that, my lord; I would not be thought to undervalue worldly enjoyments, nor out∣ward appearances: but I look into the interior of a man; I study the character, that is my habit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gift, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Solomon, a gift!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, Mr. Polycarp, it is so—And now, my Lord Janus, as we have put the business so far in train, I presume I may account myself secure of the honor of calling you my son-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honor, my good Sir Solomon, is the
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
very oath and bond of a peer; I must forfeit my title before I can falsify my word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think you'll do both at the same time.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then I may announce my happiness, and open my doors to my friends and neighbours.—Apropos to that, my lord; I chanc'd upon a friend of your's this morning, a gentleman I am under great obligations to for rescuing my daughter from her dan∣ger; a very warm admirer of your lordship, I can as∣sure you; one who speaks of you in raptures.</P>

<P>What are you about? recollect yourself—<STAGE><HI>[Apart to</HI> Lord Janus.]</STAGE> 'Tis his sensibility on the lady's account throw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him into these terrors.</P>

<P>Polycarp can witness what a shock it gave me.</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, indeed, he has not recover'd himself yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore to Sir Charles Freemantle, who was the lucky instrument of saving her, we owe the more; I thought I could not do a more acceptable thing to your lordship than give you an opportunity of telling him so. He dines with us to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>

<P>O yes; I took upon me to say you would be happy to see him at dinner.</P>
</SP>

<P>You said so, did you! You made use of my name to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, I did, my lord! I said every thing in your name that was civil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am oblig'd to you.—Mr. Polycarp, you will return me that settlement; 'tis of no present use; I can do no business to-day.</P>

<P>How so, how so? What's the matter, I beseech you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible to think of it; all my joys are frustrated, disappointment blasts my ardor; this day, this very day, and none other, had I set down for the consummation of my happiness; love fir'd my heart; generosity expanded it: the deed was ready, the very pen was in my fingers, that was to portion my bride, when suddenly my evil genius steps in, and the vision vanishes into air.</P>

<P>Get him out of it as speedily as you can, Sir Solomon, if my longer stay in it is of any consequence to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon what pretence shall I turn him thus abruptly out of my house? Has he any design upon your lordship? Is he unfit company for a gentleman? is he other than he pretend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be; a cheat, an im∣postor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been pleas'd to describe my character to you in very handsome terms: I shall not speak of his; I shall say no more of Sir Charles Free∣mantle, than that I know him only too well; and that if he is to be admitted into your house, I must positively quit it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can only assure you, Sir Solomon, that his lordship has the best reasons in the world for what he says; a person of Lord Janus's character will be very properly delicate about entering into particulars; you must not expect it from him: but if you set any value upon his alliance, I can tell you it is no otherwise to be obtained but by disinissing your visitor.</P>
</SP>

<P>No doubt, no doubt, I will, Mr. Polycarp—but how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>

<P>I am obliged to you; you have a pleasant easy way of providing for your friends. In the name of folly, why did I, a novice in iniquity, join stock with one of so establish'd a fame, that even in this odd corner of the island we can't enjoy a little season∣able obscurity?</P>

<P>Very well, I see what you point at; you told me I was to keep no secrets from my father; I am to have no preference, no choice nor will of my own. What if I don't like Lord Janus, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I to be forc'd to marry him against my inclinations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall I answer that question and not appear like a seducer? let your own heart answer it: if you do not like Lord Janus, I can only say the most admir'd young man in the kingdom is not to your taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Indeed he is not, and I could be glad you would tell me for which of his lordship's superior good qualities I ought to hold him in such admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be a little too hard upon

me; I will do him justice as a man of honor, but I will not undertake his cause as an advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you do him justice a while ago, when you told us he was diffident almost to a failing? there I think I may venture to defend his character, tho' I am as little inclin'd to be his advocate as you can be. You told us at the same time he had a good heart and an excellent understanding—'tis a pity such perfection should be lost upon me. You said that he was modest, well-bred, and of the gentlest manners—these are charming qualities; convince me only that his lordship possesses them, and I cannot chuse but admire him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie upon you, lovely but betwitching temper, you have rifled me of my heart, and now you wou'd rally me out of my reason: but I'll not be trapp'd into any such undertaking as you propose: I shall leave Lord Janus to his own defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but stay a moment, and hear how easily it is done; stand only in that place for your friend, and see how instantly you will make a convert of me; nay, but keep your post, for now I acknow∣ledge all the virtues you have ascrib'd to him, now I contemplate every thing, which I regard as worthy to be admir'd and lov'd.</P>

<P>Sir Charles Freemantle, I must beg leave to introduce myself to you as the uncle of this young lady, and as such to assure you I shall ever retain a grateful sense of the very important service you ren∣dered her this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>The interest you take in that happy event, captain, makes it doubly pleasing to me, for
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
I hope I am too good an Englishman not to reverence the character of so brave an officer, as I have now the honor to take by the hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, sir, my small services merit no such encomiums;—but, Sir Charles, I have a few words in commission from my brother, and, with my niece's Jeave, I would deliver them to you in private.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, uncle George, I will do is you bid me; I will go and leave you to yourselves—but I am sorry it must be a secret, because I am sure, if you had any thing to say that wou'd make me hap∣py, you wou'd not send me out of the way.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Eleanor.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I understood my niece rightly, Sir Charles, you have discovered the situation of things in this family, and are doing that from your own dell∣cacy, which wou'd else seem a breach of hospitality to suggest to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir; I apprehend there is business going for ward in this family, that wou'd make my company very unreasonable, and, if I am right in my conjecture, why shou'd I put you to the pain of an apology?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir Charles, you have candidly excus'd me from the most awkward service I was ever engaged in: the truth is, my brother and Lord Janus are just now very seriously employed; his lordship's lawyer is come from town for the purpose; and I understand the affair to be of such a nature, as not to allow of those attentions, which, in any other circumstances, they would be proud to pay you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly shall not think of Inter∣rupting any parties so engag'd; but I flatter myself that, to a gentleman of your character, I may speak openly and ingenuously what occurs to me on this occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means, sir; use no reserve with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must say to you in confidence, that I suspect my friend Lord Janus will meet more
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
difficulties than he seems to be aware of; and I am perswaded he is the last man living to press forward a treaty with the lady's father, unless he thought him∣self secure of her affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, but these are matters out of my line, which I never meddle in: I love my niece, and wish to see her happy, but I have no voice in the disposal of her, nor am I in the secret of her in clinati∣ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Misunderstand me not, I pray you; I am not sounding you on the subject of her inclinations, I am only guarding against those consequences, which may ensue upon the presumption of Lord Janus's dis∣appointment: I know him well, a nobler gentleman does not live, nor is there a family in the kingdom but might well be proud of his alliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very honourable testimony on your part, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but justice; and if a certain acci∣dent, which happen'd this morning, may have left impressions on your niece's mind in favour of an ob∣ject, whose pretensions cannot vie with those of Lord Janus, it becomes a very serious point with me to clear myself from all suspicion of such mean clandestine mea∣sures, as one competitor will sometimes enviously practise to degrade and level his superior; as Lord Ja∣nus is my particular friend, I must therefore insist upon an interview with him before I leave the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend you for your caution, and 'tis what you have a right to expect; but as he is now in the very act of signing and sealing with my brother, I think you will not press for it immediately, nor per∣haps consider this house as the properest place for your meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not wish to remain in this house, where my longer stay might subject me to suspicions, I have already made some sacrifices to avoid; I had rather meet Lord Janus any where else.</P>

<P>Well, child, and is not honesty a recom∣mendation in every man's character?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, yes, if he was an attorney, a very great one; but let me ask you, uncle George—was you ever in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, you idle thing you, what a question's that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever fail in love with a girl, who had nothing else to recommend her but honesty? Not you. Love himself is a thief, you know; and let Sir Charles say what fine things he will of Lord Janus, he only sets himself in a better light with me, and throws his friend to a further distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, this is mere raillery and idle talking; I flatter myself you don't intend to disap∣point your father's wishes, by refusing the great match he has provided for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if I did, coudn't I supply the place of it with one as good? I am not over-ambitious of a great title; a baronet's lady will serve my turn.</P>

<P>You cannot doubt Lord Janus's morit, when his very rival speaks so highly of him.</P>

<P>Oh dear heart! Lord Janus may have all the merit in the world, and yet my Lady Janus be a very miserable woman. But tell me what you have done with Sir Charles, and where you have dispos'd of him: I hope he's coming here again.</P>

<P>Your first I rather think, if at any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fellow stipulates for an inter∣view; he is waiting for me at a rendezvous in the wood; these people insist upon my seeing him; the captain was charg'd with a message to me; Sir Solo∣mon still engages for his daughter, if I can drive this lurking lover out of her way.</P>

<P>Explain yourself.</P>

<P>Can't you comprehend that in this un∣dress I am Harry Singleton and Lord Janus's valet de chambre, a character I am more perfect in than that

of his lordship? Well then—I make up a story for the purpose; nobody is present at our meeting, and as he does not know I have quitted my service, he believes what I rell him, and I bolt him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that your care of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, man, don't be angry: you have still a good game in hand, if Dorothy's eyes tell truth; follow up your fortune there; when I am gone, the field will be open; Sir Solomon will be outrageous against his daughter and caress you in hopes of making up matters with me: All this you can manage to your own purposes.</P>

<P>Then fare thee well, my hearty fellow, if so it shall be?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then here's my hand! and with it my promise that if ever this fame hand takes possession of Dame Dorothy's strong box, there shall be a nest-egg lest at the bottom for an unlucky friend to brood upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's honest, and I thank thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, as we are upon parting, I'll give thee a proof, that, tho' I have not known thee long, I know thee well. Thou hast every quality of a gen∣tleman about thee, but the principles of one; birth, that shou'd not have been disgrac'd; education, that

ought not to have been abus'd; and talents, which it is a scandal to pervest; had you applied them as you ought, instead of sinking into the menial drudgery of service, you might have rais'd yourself to a level with that station, which you treacherously counterfeit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil himself will turn moralist, if you begin a preaching; therefore no more, but be∣take yourself to your Dorothy; if my string fails, I shall away to the next inn, there consign myself to the basket of some charitable stage, where I shall sit like the real Janus, with a melancholy face looking back∣wards on the world, and meditating on the quick transitions of all human grandeur.</P>

<P>A good token, Mr. Polycarp, a special good token; 'tis a way she has; it runs in her family; when I courted her mother, she was for all the world like Eleanor; you would have sworn she cou'd not bear the sight of me; she wou'd run away and hide herself, if she did but hear the very sound of my foot.</P>

<P>A true lover will live a long while upon hope.</P>

<SP>

<P>Then it must not be that meagre moon-shine diet, which poor Lord Janus is fed with; it must not be that maw kish greensick hope that tantalizes his ap∣petite: a few hours perhaps, a day or two at most I can live upon it, but fix a certain time, an early mo∣ment for my happiness, or expect to see me pine away into an atrophe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then perhaps—but take notice I'll not be hurried—perhaps I may consent to give you hopes, if I find you in the same mind a twelvemonth hence.</P>

<P>A very proper compliment you pay to my sagacity, tho' I have shewn you I am capable of dis∣covering the false character and sham pretensions of a counterfeit, you won't credit me for discerning the good and genuine qualities of a man of honor: How is this? I desire to know if truth is not as obvious in it's natural character as falsehood in a feign'd one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my Eleanor, let him answer that if he can: I am witness you was never dup'd by this sham lord, your natural intuition saw more than our older experience could discover; for my part I did not like him, but I did not absolutely suspect him, and when Sir Charles spoke so highly of his merit, I confess I was fairly stagger'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>So was not I as to my own judgment of Lord Janus; I own I was puzzled how to account for Sir Charles's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must have appear'd egregiously absurd—But is it not time we proceeded to the detec∣tion of him?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my good lord, what news do you give me of Sir Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best that can be: You have seen the last of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry let him go, and a good riddance say I: I guess'd how-it wou'd be when your lordship took him in hand; I thought he cou'd not have the face to stand his ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>To do him justice I had very little trou∣ble in bringing him to a proper understanding of him∣self, as soon as I convinc'd him I was serious in my intentions to make your daughter Lady Janus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he was inform'd of that by my brother George.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, but he was pleas'd to say he wou'd take it upon nobody's word but my own; men of the world, Sir Solomon, are hard to believe that persons of high rank and nobility will step out of their own line for an alliance, when there is so much beauty and attraction amongst their equals, but I have no such pride of nobility about me; my only am∣bition is to be happy, and I persuade myself your ami∣able daughter is the very woman in the world to make me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I am fully sensible of your great condescension in accepting of my humble alliance, and I hope, if you can overlook the little awkwardness and reluctances of an inexperienc'd girl like my Eleanor, you will find her mend upon acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubt not, Sir Solomon, but I can make allowances for such tristing foibles as I have discover'd in Miss Eleanor; so far from being piqu'd at her seem∣ing partiality for Sir Charles, I like her the better for it: it proves to me that her nature is susceptible of love, and as I hope to render her greater services than he has persorm'd, I don't doubt of meeting greater returns of love than he has receiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lordship charms me with the gene∣rous candor of your noble sentiments. I do not say to you that my daughter shall obey me, because I trust there will be no such repugnance on her part as may provoke me to compulsion; but be this as it may, at
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
all events I beg you to conclude the thing as done; and now, my lord, permit me to address you as a mem∣ber of my family, and tell you that there is an affair now in agitation, which gives me great alarm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess the matter you allude to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say your lordship does, and I hope you have that influence and authority over Mr. Poly∣carp as may prevent it: My cousin Dorothy is an old maid, and as that is a condition not of her own chus∣ing, I am afraid there will be little difficulty in per∣suading her to change it: now, my lord, her fortune, which is no trifle, sleeps in my hands, and if she calls it out in haste, she will disable me from paying down the full sum upon the nail, which I am pledg'd for to your lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, Sir Solomon, I am as annious to prevent this match as you can be, and I will take occasion to talk to Mr. Polycarp in a way, that shall make him desist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my lord, if the question be not an improper one, what is Mr. Polycarp's situation in life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Polycarp's situation is dependant; I took him into my pay to relieve me from the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgery of writing letters to agents and auditing accounts with srewards; he understands law, and is no bad scholar, tho' something of the paedagogue, for to say the truth he was awhile ago an usher in a country school; he is by no means of condition to aspire to Mrs. Dorothy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have said enough, my lord, the country usher is enough, there's an end of Mr. Polycarp, there's not another old damsel in all England so proud of her family as cousin Dorothy: but apropoat here comes my gentleman, with your lordship's leave I will turn him over to you to prepar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him for his dismission.</P>

<P>By no means, I credit you for your honor to the full as much as I do for your title, but I had rather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rust to your knavery than either, for knave to knave must be honest or adieu to the trade; therefore you will marry Eleanor when Eleanor is in the mind to marry, and I shall move off with Dorothy, when Do∣rothy will move off with me.</P>

I do but as the rest of my brother nobles: I am sitting up the great hall in Janus Castle for my theatre; there's an end of all old-fashion'd customs, instead of dinners of five courses, we serve you up dramas of five acts; feast your ears and fast your stomachs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confound the fellow! his ingenuity almost excuses his iniquity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well to be sure if you call this a play, I have seen many a one in my time and never thought the actors in earnest before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, sirrah! but, my lord, a word or two about this play—I am pretty well vers'd
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
in the poets, and don't remember any thing about tearing a gentleman's throat out on the stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir Solomon, there is great tearing of throats on the stage, but you must know this piece is in manuscript; the author's modesty don't mean to publish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my lord is the author, I dare say he does not with his name to be known.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No truly, if his lordship comes into the world it will be under a feign'd title.</P>

<P>So cousin Dorothy, you come too late for the rehearsal; my lord and Mr. Polycarp have been performing in a very capital sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you mean? what has his lord∣ship <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> performing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! such a scene of fire and fury—Poor Mr. Polycarp had l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to have been f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>angled by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hemence of his acting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What tell you me of acting? His lord∣ship feels a proper indignation for the insults I have receiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! child, 'twas only part of a play they were repeating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand hie lordship's delicacy in giving it that turn, and I hold myself for ever bound to him for taking up my cause so warmly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Madam, you give me more credit than I deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, be silent upon that subject, you will but expose yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you have been properly chastised, I hope I shall no more be troubled with your imper∣tinence: A pal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry paedagogue indeed to talk in such a stile to a person of my sort—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, who talks to a person of your sort? Can't you be persuaded that nobody thought about you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>If nobody thought more about me than you, or the doughty Captain there, I might have been subjected to any indignities in your house, but my Lord Janus has the spirit of a nobleman, and will not suffer a lady to be insulted with impunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I consess you have reason to be offended; I have certainly omitted some points of civility, which you had a right to expect, and so to set all matters strait, I'll leave the house this very moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, Sir!—You have had your play, let us have our's; the performers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-e all ready, and only wait the prompter's signal; I'll touch the bell and let 'em enter.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Janus</SPEAKER>
<P>My death-warrant by all that's terrible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday! who are these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very capital performers some of them; these worthy fellows play the parts of constables; the ladies were to have been married in the play to a pair of the most infamous sharpers in the kingdom, but they have escap'd out of their clutches; this gentleman, who is nothing better than a lord's lacquey, plays the part of his master; this other gentleman, who is his brother in iniquity, has been seized by the throat in the play, and by the throat will be seiz'd when it is over: the manager and director of the whole move∣ment, to whom alone we are indebted for the happy turn of the plot, you behold in this worthy baronet, the benefactor, friend and preserver of us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, noble Captain, you will not for∣get to reserve a part for the hangman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy of mercies, have I been dup'd, gull'd, bamboozled after all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egregiously, my good brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure you have. Cou'd not you find out your Imposter as readily as I did mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps his worship did not look so close as you did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, you are well off; hold your tongue and be thankful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon, I congratulate you on your escape. You have been harbouring a knavish lacquey under a counterseited title of a noble lord.—Now, Mr. Harry Singleton, stand forth! What have you to say for yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little, Sir Charles. I have cer∣tainly made free with his lordship's title; but I have endeavoured to do it all the honor in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do it honor, sirrah! how can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>By bestowing it on the most amiable young lady in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, there is some ingenuity in your defence, but it would be an injury to mankind to let such a fellow loose upon the world; Sir Solomon, you are an acting magistrate, you will make out his commitment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I an acting magistrate, Sir Charles! I am an acting fool if you please; give him his dismission, and send me to the house of correction in his room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I might advise, your worship shou'd turn him over to the jurymen in livery, and then he will be tried by his peers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir Charles Freemantle, I be seech you to take pity upon a poor young fellow, who has known better days, and been corrupted by the evil ha∣bits of that fraternity, into which his hard fortune in∣listed him; put me into any humble way of life, and I will be honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canting rascal! I always thought you wou'd die dunghill at the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday, here's a sturdy spirit! 'tis a pity we have no pressgangs going: Cousin Dorothy, what shall we do with this fellow?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do with him! there's no doing any thing with him let the law deal with him as he de∣serves.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mitigate my sentence I beseech you: save me from matrimony, and I submit to transportation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my child, all joy to you: 'Tis the first match I have attempted to make for you, and it shall be the last: hereafter let your own inclinations be your guide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Eleanor, I can pretty nearly guess which way they will lead you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear uncle, you have a talent for discoveries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon, you have no impostor now to deal with; my character will meet the scru∣tiny. May I not aspire to claim what I have been so happy as to save?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart and my blessing to boot; I know of you well, Sir Charles, and shall be proud of your alliance. Now let us have a general gaol delivery, and since his mock lordship has fairly brought his drama to it's catastrophe, let us drop our curtain and humbly hope for the plaudit of your hands.</P>

<L>CUNNING projectors may pretend to find</L>
<L>A scheme for sailing ships against the wind,</L>
<L>But never poet yet cou'd start a scheme</L>
<L>For navigating plays against the stream:</L>
<L>Oh heavens! no sooner does your angry gale</L>
<L>Hiss in his teeth, then back goes every sail,</L>
<L>Furious he drives—Ah, dreadful situation!</L>
<L>Stern foremost down the <HI>rapides</HI> of damnation.</L>

<L>To pull and tug and puff against the tide,</L>
<L>But what is one poor puff of his own making,</L>
<L>When all around him the wild waves are breaking?</L>
<L>Plung'd in the gulph like Ceyx still he raves,</L>
<L>Murmuring his own applause beneath the waves.</L>

<L>Magnetic quacks can stare you into fits,</L>

<L>Not so Miss Biddy—she is all for feeling,</L>
