<HEAD>SECRET
MEMOIRS
OF A
Treasonable Conference.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has often been said
in Publick, and once in
Print, by a noble Per∣son,
who became an
Author upon that very
Occasion: That there
were a Set of TORIES in this King∣dom,
who were always sincere in the
Revolution-Principle, and loyal Sub∣jects
to the Sovereign; Friends to
the Establishment in Church and
State, and who ought still to be
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
treated as true Lovers of their Coun∣try:
The Reason given for this was,
because they had shewn themselves
so upon all Occasions; and especially
in the late Reign, when the Whigs
and they joyn'd in against the last
Ministry of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and against
the Measures of that Time: It was
remembred of these Men, that they
came into the Interest of the Pro∣testant
Succession, with such sea∣senable
Zeal and Affection, that the
King thought fit to entrust several
of them with a Part in the Regency;
committing a Share of the first Ad∣ministration
to their Hands, as Per∣sons
who had given such Testimony
of their Fidelity, as was not only sa∣tisfactory
to his Majesty, but as had
even reconciled some of the best of
his Subjects to them; and upon this
Principle, many of them were very
kindly accepted, and <HI>all the rest who
came in to their Measures,</HI> were distin∣guished
by the Name of <HI>REVOLƲ∣TION
TORIES.</HI></P>
<P>It has since been observ'd in their
Favour, that none of these Revoluti∣on
Tories, especially of the more con∣siderable
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
of them, ever came into the
late Rebellion, or can be said to
have concerted any Measures with
the Rebels; But, on the contrary, ad∣hering
strictly to the passive Do∣ctrine,
which at first went a great
way in denominating them as <HI>Tories,</HI>
they never suffered <HI>Nature to act a∣gainst
Principle;</HI> No not even then,
when they thought themselves not
treated according to their Merit.</P>
<P>But as it has all along been the
Opinion of some wise Men, that
<HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> however moderate,
are by the Nature of their politick
Notions, incompatible in the Admi∣nistration
of this Government; so it
could not be far, that Men of such
differing Foundations could go toge∣ther;
NO: notwithstanding their
Agreement in the main and funda∣mental
Points of the Constitution:
and tho' the Wisdom of the Govern∣ment
found it possible, and perhaps
endeavour'd to have made it more
so, to go on with these Men with a
great deal of Harmony and Unani∣mity,
in the more general and essen∣tial
Parts of the publick Business,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and that they, on their part, seem'd
to come heartily into those common
Points, which are necessary to all Go∣vernment;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>resisting the Rebels,</HI>
settling <HI>the Revenue,</HI> raising <HI>Troops,
Taxes,</HI> &amp;c. yet when it came to the
Push, in the nicer Parts of the Admi∣nistration,
<HI>such as</HI> prosecuting neces∣sary
Justice upon Criminals, suppres∣sing
Riots and Tumults, entrusting
needful Powers in the Hands of the
Sovereign upon extraordinary Occa∣sions;
putting in, and putting out
Persons, and several other like Cases;
these Gentlemen have been constant∣ly
found to be a dead Weight against
the common Interest; and if the Ja∣cobites
have not been visibly joyn'd,
they have not fail'd to encourage
themselves with the Expectation that
some time or other they might, by
the help of these <HI>Tories,</HI> embarrass the
Government with it self, and open
a Gap, by the Dissention of Parties,
to break in upon the Constitution,
and upon the Succession also.</P>
<P>Upon these Discoveries, the Go∣vernment
have frequently been obli∣ged
to displace and dismiss them
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
from their Share in the Manage∣ment;
and the King has at several
Times remov'd most of them from
his Councils and Service, and that
not without due Resentment against
their Conduct; NOW as this dis∣plac'd
Circumstance is greatly their
Disadvantage, as a Party, and to
their personal Mortification also; so
it has not been thought to be the ea∣siest
to them of any thing in the
World; and therefore it will sur∣prize
no Body to hear that they
have, upon several Occasions, laid
their Heads together, and joyn'd
their Interests, in Order to retrieve
their Affairs, and if possible to re∣place
themselves in the Favour of the
Sovereign, and by Consequence in
their ancient Interests and Employ∣ments.</P>
<P>Nor
will it seem strange, that they
have taken into their Consultations,
and made a Confidence with some,
who have not been so famous for
favouring the Revolution, as they
themselves have been; tho' per∣haps
they may not have come over
to the Jacobite Principle for all that;</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
It was some time ago, that the
Heads of this Party began to con∣cert
their Measures one with another,
for the re-establishing their Interests,
and had not the Rebellion interven'd,
they had no Question gone about it
much sooner; But as Friends are
tryed by the Circumstances which
those are in who want them, so it
was here.</P>
<P>It may be observed here, that
these <HI>Revolution Tories,</HI> have at di∣vers
Times, played divers Sorts of
Games, still aiming at the same End,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Restoration of their In∣terests:
For Example; while the Court
proceeded in the ordinary Measures
of the Administration, they could
take none but ordinary Measures to
introduce themselves; but when the
Government seem'd alarm'd, and
that a Rebellion appear'd in the
Heart of his Majesties Dominions:
they apparently acted an extraordi∣nary
Part, <HI>that is to say,</HI> they set up
for a Kind of Neutrality in Poli∣ticks,
<HI>as if they had told us,</HI> that they
wanted only to see if the Rebellion
should prove successful, and so turn
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
into a <HI>Revolution;</HI> in which Case they
stood ready, as it might be said, to
plead Merit with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and
extenuate their taking part with the
House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by shewing, upon
the weak and passive Part they had
acted, and how little Service they had
done: On the other Hand, if the
Rebellion fail'd, as they had reason
to believe it would, they had held
themselves, as if in Appearance they
had been Friends to the House of
<HI>Hanover,</HI> and then had their Merit
to plead on that Account also.</P>
<P>This Abridgement of their Poli∣ticks,
may receive some Evidence
from their present Conduct; and
therefore the following Parts of se∣cret
History is laid open, which in
general, may serve to clear up the
Eye-sight of those, who incline to
the old Game of A MOTTLEY
MINISTRY.</P>
<P>It was at a House bearing the
Name of one of the most ancient
Kingdoms of the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy,</HI>
where upon a select Occasion the
Heads of the abovenamed male∣contented
Party are said to have met,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
the Occasion of the Congress, as we
are inform'd, was in short this.</P>
<P>The present Government had
thought fit upon Occasions, which
these Gentlemen esteem'd TRI∣FLING
and MEAN, to displace,
as before, almost all these who we
call <HI>Revolution Tories;</HI> and had dis∣miss'd
them from their Employments,
Favours, Trusts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a Word, had put
them out of publick Business; and this,
Notwithstanding most of them had
declar'd in the most seasonable time,
and in the most acceptable Terms,
for the Protestant Succession, and
had appear'd so hearty in the Inte∣rest
of King <HI>George,</HI> that the late
Party thought them irreconcilable,
and the present thought them
sincerely engaged in their Interest.</P>
<P>This, as it was first a little strange
to the People without Doors; so the
Gentlemen complain'd of it, as high∣ly
unjust, and as in it self ingrate.
It is true, good Manners, and some
Principles of Duty, oblig'd them not
to reflect personally upon the King;
they therefore, according to the
old way, of laying all upon the Backs
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
of evil Councellors, thought fit to
charge it as a Crime upon the pre∣sent
Ministry; and after many private
and some publick Exclamations,
which by the way made them much
acquainted with each other's Re∣sentment,
they came thereby to
communicate to one another their
Grievances, and at length to resolve
upon closer Consultations for the
Remedies, and upon what were the
most proper Measures to do them∣selves
Justice.</P>
<P>Before we enter far into their
Measures, it seems needful that we
should know something of the Per∣sons,
and especially a little of the
Characters of those, who were the
chief Movers in the Machine, which
was now form'd, and in this we
question not to make the Descripti∣ons
so plain, as that there need be
no Occasion for Names, in the most
secret Part of the ensuing History.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> was an eminent Person
of the first Rank of Peers; it was
hard to say, whether his ancient
House, and the Dignity of his Birth,
or the high Stations he had been in
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
under several Monarchs, had given
him the greater Esteem of himself:
but it seems that this over rating
his own Merit, had been for 28
Years a stated Reason for his not suf∣fering
any of his Sovereigns to conti∣nue
long in his Favour; and by Con∣sequence,
for his not being long in
theirs: He had indeed some valuable
Things in him, yet he rather was
thought wise, than was really so;
and his Want of Constancy, in either
the worst, or the best of things, cau∣sed
him to pass neither for the worst
or the best of Men: He had not so
little Foresight as not to joyn with
every rising Side; but had so little
Courage, as never to risque any
thing for the best of them: As long
as things run smooth, the Ministry
<HI>for the Time being,</HI> were sure of him;
and when they ceas'd to do so, they
were as sure to lose him: The King
found him in the Place of Prime
Minister, but he declar'd himself un∣equal
to the Weight of that Em∣ployment;
not for want of Capacity,
so much as want of Application:
Indolence so engross'd him, that he
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
could rather bear the Reproach of
Impotence, than the Fatigue of Bu∣siness:
Thus he found himself insen∣sibly
drop out of the publick Affairs,
and made himself a meer Invalid
in his Countries Service.</P>
<P>He had been easy enough in this
State, thro' the excessive Love of
his own Quiet, nor could the Noti∣on
of being slighted affect him; be∣ing
above it in Fortune, and below
it in Passion; if the restless Impor∣tunities
of the most impertinent good
Wife in the World, had not hurried
him out of a State of Negligence,
next Door to Stupidity, to the Cir∣cumstance
of a Malecontent, even to
a Degree, next Door to a criminal
Disaffection.</P>
<P>He had marry'd a Wife in a Coun∣try
famous for politick Beauties;
whence he had brought Home a
Lady, who must be thought eminent
for the first, since without the Assist∣ance
of the last, she found Means
to remove her self from an abandon∣ed
Condition, to the Arms of a Man
of Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
This Lady, of whom <HI>Fame</HI> tells
us, that she was born laughing, and
bred up to talk to Kings and prin∣ces,
as familiarly as they to their
Lap-Dogs; finding it would not do
in our Court, had liked to have
turned Malecontent before her
Lord; but as she was impatient of
an outed-Condition when she was
reduced to it, she never left laughing
and shewing her Teeth, till she
made him resolve to set all the
Wheels he could think of a going,
to work himself into the Administra∣tion.</P>
<P>It
was this <HI>Monoculus,</HI> who follow∣ing
and teizing the rest of his Male∣content
Friends, brought them to
appoint this Congress, to consider of
their Affairs, the manner of which
may be as instructing in the Disco∣very,
as the Thing it self.</P>
<P>It was one Morning early, when
with his Head full of Chagrin, and
of mischievous Resolutions, <HI>Monoculus</HI>
was gone abroad, uncertain whether
to guide his Thoughts, and to whom
to break the Discontents, which yet
he was too big with to retain; when
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
driving in his Coach by the King's
old ruin'd Palace, he met NIGRO∣QUE,
an old discarded Statesman,
and a most natural Malecontent, just
coming out at the Gate, <HI>for it seems
he lived within the Palace:</HI> he was
reading a long Scroul, containing
a List of Names, and had not
seen his Grace, but that the latter
making a Motion towards him, and
stopping his Coachman, my Lord's
Coachman stopt also.</P>
<P><HI>Nigroque,</HI> neither in Dignity or
Antiquity of Blood equal to <HI>Mono∣culus,</HI>
was nevertheless <HI>a Peer;</HI> his
Family had raised themselves one
Generation only before him, and that,
as was said, from the meanest Part
of the Practice of the Law, by which
Means we find him a Cousin Ger∣man
to the <HI>Plebeii,</HI> being two Re∣moves
only from <HI>nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to this Original, he was
noble by Birth, rather than Dispo∣sition:
as he was a States-man by
Office, rather than Capacity: He had
newly made an Attempt to be ho∣nest,
but personated the Patriot so
awkwardly, that the Disguise was
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
a Burthen to himself, and like <HI>David</HI>
in <HI>Saul</HI>'s Armour, he was uneasy
till he was reduced to his State of
Nature: as he had not Skill enough
to keep himself conceal'd, so he had
not worth enough to keep himself
employed; the King, who wanted
no forced Friends, and feared no Ene∣mies,
had suffered the Encumbrance
of him in his Council, in hopes, by
the Advantages of being faithful, to
bring him to the Love of it; But
finding him incorrigible, delivered
himself from one, who made no o∣ther
Use of his Favour, than to shew
every Body that he knew not how
to deserve it: His highest Ambition
seem'd to center in two Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
To be rich, and a Politician: The
first he obtain'd, <HI>if Fame lies not,</HI> at
the Expence of some Morals; the
last he fail'd in, as most Men do,
who attempt things in Spight of
Nature: We have rarely heard him
blam'd for want of Devotion, but
often have heard it questioned, whe∣ther
it was in him the Product of
Ignorance or Superstition, <HI>be that as
it will,</HI> his Excess that way has en∣titled
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
him to two Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to
be the most bigotted, and the most
Priest-ridden Peer in the three King∣doms;
both which assisted him much
in his present discontented Circum∣stances,
and particularly as it gave
him an Opportunity to list himself
in the Service of the <HI>High Church,</HI>
which is at present in a State of
Humiliation; his Lordship being
wonderfully qualified thereby, as
well as by his natural Complection, to
talk DISMALLY, about her pre∣sent
Circumstances, and to espouse
her in the Quality of a Knight Er∣rant:
It was in this Service that he
had long been employed to make
as many of his Acquaintance as he
could, be as malecontent as himself;
in which Work he bestirred himself
Night and Day, with the same Di∣ligence
which he was so fam'd for
in a certain Office, where, it was ob∣served,
he was always most employ∣ed,
where there was least to do.</P>
<P>In the present Prosecution of these
great Designs for the Church, he
had drawn out a long and double
List, of which we shall say more in
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
its turn; it is sufficient for the pre∣sent,
to mention the Title, which was
drectly thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM>FRIENDS TO THE CHURCH.</ITEM>
<ITEM>FRIENDS TO THE CHURCH.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Who they were which it seems he
had set down promiscuously under
that happy Appellation, we shall see
in the sequel.</P>
<P>This was the Paper <HI>Nigroque</HI> was
reading in his Chariot, as above,
when <HI>Monoculus</HI> stopt his Coach to
speak to him, and upon which the
following Discourse began between
them.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> says his Grace, <HI>I am ex∣ceeding
glad to meet</HI> you, I was want∣ing
an Opportunity to communicate
some Thoughts of Importance, and
no Man so fit as your self; Can you
throw half an Hour away to the Ser∣vice
of your Friend?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time, my Lord, employ'd
with your Grace, can never be thrown
away: I'll be at your Service.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I need not tell you,
that as publick Matters go, we are all
very uneasie, and like to be worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nig.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the publick Affairs, my
Lord, look DISMAL, very DISMAL.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, there seems to
me to be a happy Juncture, when some∣thing
may be attempted to retrieve our
Affairs, and I had a great Mind to
concert some Measures with your
Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attempts! my Lord, What can
your Grace mean by Attempts? Force
will do nothing! You see how the At∣tempts
that have been made, have not
not only miscarried, but have serv'd
even to fix the Government as it is, in
a Posture unmoveable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship mistakes me
very much; I did not mean such
Attempts; I am an Enemy to all Dan∣gers,
and dangerous Attempts; that you
know very well, my Lord.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I think there is room
to propose many things, and I am well
assured some Measures might be en∣tred
into, to serve these Men as they
have served us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before we think of Measures,
we must think of Men: It will amount
to very little for <HI>your Grace</HI> and I to
contemplate our Countries Ruine, and
make a Turn in Speculation; you see
all is gone, and there seems a Fare to
be upon us, that our Friends have no
Concert, we are in no Figure, have no
Correspondence together, whereby we
might assist to save our Country, and
save the Church from the most DIS∣MAL
Circumstance that she was ever
in since the Reformation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the very thing, my
Lord, that has taken up my Thoughts
for some time, and upon which I de∣sir'd
to Discourse your <HI>Lordship,</HI> and I
am very glad to find your Thoughts
agree so well with mine; I wish your
<HI>Lordship</HI> would enter a little with me

Strength: Have we any Number of
Friends?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Grace proposes a Mate∣rial
Question, and I have spent some
time upon the same Thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad, <HI>my Lord,</HI> our
Notions agree so well in the main
Point. Pray, <HI>my Lord,</HI> have you made
any Estimate? How do we stand? Are
our Numbers any thing considera∣ble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had a List in my Hand when
your Grace stopt, and was looking it
over, we are not so few in Number,
as we are weak in Council; we are
perfectly disconcerted, have no esta∣blisht
Confidence one in another, nor
do I see any Measures can be entred in∣to
till we have form'd our selves: We
can no more act in the confused Con∣dition
we are in now, than an Army
can fight without drawing up in Or∣der
of Battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your Lordship's O∣pinion
entirely; but how shall we put
our selves into a better Posture?
Pray, <HI>my Lord,</HI> will you give me
leave to see your List?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nigroque</HI> puts the List into his Hand: <HI>Monoculus</HI> look'd first in general on the Number of Names, before he be∣gan to read.</NOTE> <HI>my Lord,</HI> with all
my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, my Lord, here is
a good Number of them; if your Lordship
is sure of all these, our Strength is great∣er
than I expected. I'll assure you, if
it be so, I shall begin to have some
Courage again, and to entertain some
better hopes than I have done; for I
always love a Cause according to the
Number of its Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall think of some more
Names yet then are there; for these
are hastily set down, and perhaps,
when your Grace has read the List, you
may think of some also.</P>

<P>I am reading it, my Lord.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Monoculus</HI> reads a litile way, and starts at some Names, making a full stop.</NOTE></P>

<P>Some, my Lord, I assure

</SP>

<P>Why, <HI>my Lord,</HI> they can ne∣ver

left them all at the late Turn, and
they will never come into any Measures
but such as will destroy us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Grace will be of a∣nother
Mind in this particular; for
tho' we are not for the Pretender as
he is a Popish Prince, yet we join all
against the present People, and the <HI>Ja∣cobites</HI>
are all for us as one Man, with∣out
asking any Terms for their Cause
as <HI>Jacobites.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, they need not ask
any better Terms for their Cause, than
to have the Church Party join Interest
with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beseech your Grace to abate
a little Severity in that Case, we must
distinguish very much between the Ja∣cobite
Party joining with us, and our
joining with the Jacobite Party; are
not we able to over-rule them in the
Case of the <HI>Pretender?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant your Lordship there is
a Difference, as you say; but let me
add, what I remember to have heard
your <HI>Lordship</HI> say in the Case of the
late <HI>Treasurer,</HI> that he join'd with
the High Church, upon a Presumption
of <HI>managing them;</HI> and they, when they
were got in, turn'd the Tables upon
the Gamester, and <HI>manag'd him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Case is right, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
and I remember my saving so to your
Grace; but the Argument is on my
side, that was my Opinion then, be∣cause
I knew the High Church were
superior to him, and were too strong for
him to him, them; and the same Strength
of the High Church Interest, is the
Reason why we may manage the <HI>Ja∣cobites,</HI>
as it was the Reason why he
could not manage us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord, I will submit
to your Measures, rather than dispute
at the beginning of our Engagement:
I hope you will undertake to guard us
against the <HI>Pretnder,</HI> for you know
we have none of us been in that In∣terest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the <HI>Pretender</HI> is
now out of the Question; he is gone,
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
Defeated, his Cause lost, his own
Friends would be glad he was decently
disposed of, if they could but come in with
us to a High Church Administration:
they have had a Blow for it, we stood
still at a Distance and look'd on; Now
the Thing's over, our Designs look a∣nother
Way; our Business is to over∣throw
the horrid Schemes which the
<HI>Whigs</HI> have laid for entailing the Ad∣ministration
upon them and their Heirs
for ever, and to try what can be done
to bring honest Men into play again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are exactly my Thoughts,
and methinks the Thing is not impos∣sible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wife Men never dispair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, to speak a lit∣tle
to your List of Names, I perceive
they are in two Columns, let me under∣stand
it a little better; pray, what is
the Meaning of the Division?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is thus, my Lord:
The <HI>first Column</HI> consists of those, who,
I think, we are sure of, and most of
whom have been spoken with upon the
Head. The <HI>second Column</HI> is of those
who we must endeavour to bring in,
and who, if they can be obtain'd, will
secure us a Majority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Lord, I find that
all the Popish, all the Nonjuring,
and all the known Jacobite Lords,
are in your first Column.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beseech your Grace to
drop that Scruple, I answer for it,
you shall be satisfyed we are right,
and that there is no Danger of them;
they will all come in to our Mea∣sures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, my Lord, but
they will, in View of bringing us at
last into theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nig.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, we make
use of them to do our own Busi∣ness,
and shall take Care of them
afterward; Fear not, my Lord, your
Grace cannot think they are able to
overpower the Church Party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, my Lord; but
it is surprizing a little, 'tis a dan∣gerous
Push.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nig.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must put that to the
Venture, my Lord; you know the
Maxim of the Time, in extraordi∣nary
Cases, we must take extraordi∣nary
Methods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord, I see a
Name here, which I have a great
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
Opinion of for his Capacity, and tho'
he is a Jacolite in his Principle, yet
I take him for a Man of Probity and
Honour, and I believe especially
since he is a Dignitary of the—I
cannot doubt his being true to her
Interest: Pray have you had his
Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lord, and his
solemn Engagement too, that tho'
he is for the Pretender in his Desire
and Design, yet that he will never
act any thing for him against our
Measures, nor but upon such Provi∣sion,
for the Safety of the Church,
as shall satisfy us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my Lord ..... come
in upon such Terms! then I acqui∣esce;
I wish we might meet some∣times
to settle these things a little,
then we might bring Matters to
some Kind of Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you lead me to
an openness with your Grace, which
I rather waited an Occasion for,
than make any Scruple of; your
Grace cannot doubt, but before I
came the length which you see, and
which I must have gone, to be sure
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
of all those Names, which you see
in the first Column of my List, there
has been several Meetings, and are
fet and appointed Consultations, a∣mong
such as we can depend upon,
and where, I dare say, there is not
one Man but will think it a happy
Step, and express the utmost Satis∣faction,
if I had the Honour to in∣troduce
your Grace; and to be yet
freer in this Matter with your Grace,
we are appointed to meet this Even∣ing
at the Duke of—for in a
Word, my Lord, the Case is of the
utmost Importance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with your Lordship
that it is of the utmost Importance,
and shall be very willing to wait
upon your Lordship to the Place,
if you think my coming will be
agreeable; but shall we enter into
some of the Names, in the second
Column of your List?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nigro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had rather your Grace
would defer it to the Evening,
when you shall know what Steps
has been taken, and what remains
still to take; for this is the most ge∣neral
Meeting we have had, and in
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
which we propose not only to com∣pare.
Notes with one another, and
inform our selves what every one has
done, but to resolve upon our far∣ther
Proceedings, and come to a
Point what is next to be done; for
Matters can never rest thus, a few
Months more will fix the Enemies
of the Church past all Possibility
of removing them, and put the
Church into a Condition not to be
recovered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord, I will at∣tend,
and will be glad to find such
Measures taken, as I have Reason
to expect, from the Wisdom and
Conduct of such Heads, as I find by
your List are concerned in this weigh∣ty
Affair.</P>
</SP>
<P>This short Conversation being
over, the new Allies, after mutual
Assurances of Friendship and Con∣fidence,
separated for a Time; <HI>Mo∣noculus</HI>
went immediately back to his
<HI>Italian</HI> with the News, and gave her
a full and distinct Account of what
had passed; she began to grin as soon
as he but named the Person, but
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
laughed so loud, when he came to
the Story of the List, and the two
Columns, that as familiar as her
Tittillations are to his Grace, he
could not but be a little interrupt∣ed
with them: whereupon he pres∣sed
her to abate a while, that he
might finish the Relation, but it was
in vain; so he withdrew and left
her laughing.</P>
<P>But to return to the diligent Gen∣tleman
we talked of: <HI>Monoculus</HI>
was no sooner in his Coach, but
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> pursued the Progress he was
upon before; this was to go to a
certain Ecclesiastick, who his Lord∣ship
had of late renewed his Intima∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
with; for between them the
Interests of the Church were con∣stantly
taken Care of, <HI>after their man∣ner:</HI>
This was the indefatigable Fa∣ther
in God, <HI>Oracle</HI> Bishop of .....
This <HI>Oracle</HI> was a Bishop of the
last Promotion, and if modern Pro∣phets
err not in VISION, his will
be the last Promotion of the Kind:
He had the Fame of a compleat State
Firebrand before his Exaltation, and
some have said of him, that his Share
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
in the Pontificate, has but very little
abated the Acrimony of his Brains:
His Zeal for the Church, it seems,
made him less a Friend to the <HI>Hano∣ver</HI>
Succession, than he might other∣wise
have been; being convinced,
that if that Family came to the
Crown, the Plague of Moderation,
which High-Church Men have gene∣rally
in all Ages had an Aversion to,
would break out upon the Church,
and spread over her whole Body,
to the Ruin of her Constitution, and
of all those who expected to tyran∣nize
under her Protection, and by
her Authority: Besides this, it was
his professed Opinion, that the Pro∣testant
Church of <HI>England,</HI> might
be very safe under a Popish Pre∣tender:
and that if not, the preserv∣ing
that Succession was of so much
more Moment, than preserving the
Church, that we ought to run the
Risque of the latter, to secure the
former: This Reverend Person was
now become the <HI>Oracle</HI> of the High-Church
Party, and had their Esteem
most, for those very things which
recommended him least; he was, if
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
Fame flatters him not, a Man of po∣lite
Parts, but generally was thought
more of a Statesman than a Chri∣stian,
more a Courtier, than a
Churchman; and more a Scholar,
than a Gentleman: His Zeal in
publick Matters was as warm, as
in religious Matters cold, and it
was thought, he would sooner be a
Martyr for his politick Principles,
than his Religious; hence Whigs in
the State, were more his Horror,
than Hereticks in the Church; and
he was far more eager to extirpate
Republicans, than Socinians.</P>
<P>From hence also it came to pass,
that he was not only hearty in the
present Design, but was the Spring,
and first Mover of the whole Work,
the Axis upon which it all turn'd,
and the Engineer by whom the
whole Scheme was laid, NIGROQ.
was indeed a good Second, and be∣came
next to ORACLE, the grand
Wheel in the Movement; But
ORACLE was the chief.</P>
<P>As he had contriv'd the intended
Congress, in the Affair now to be
spoken of, so he had not been want∣ing
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
to find proper Persons to form
the Assembly, and had Agents rea∣dy
on all Hands to fill it up, to what
Number might be found proper;
the Names which <HI>Nigroq.</HI> had drawn
up in a List, were of his collecting,
the Characters of his giving, he had
sounded the Depth, and tryed the
Temper of many of them, and as
he determin'd, more or less Weight
was put upon them, in the present
Affair: his Pains were indefatigable
in bringing over to his Designs those
who he thought might be useful,
and in managing Tempers, he had
such a Skill, that like Sathan, he al∣ways
took hold of Men by the right
Handle.</P>
<P><HI>Buquinquhan,</HI> a Peer of the most
exquisite cunning, was a Prostitute
to his Wit; in Spight of insufferable
Pride, and pretended Gravity; that
Duke submitted to be managed by
his Dexterity; he made him seem
pious, in Spight of an established
Character to the contrary, and set
him up to act for the Church, who
wanted the very first Notions of
any thing that was religious.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35"/>
<HI>Oracle</HI> knew, this politick Peer
would neither serve them, or any one
else, further than by opposing his
Interest to the Ministry, in the or∣dinary
Course, but would fail them
or trick them in any further Depen∣dencies;
so that he was too wary to
expect, and too cautious to desire
his Assistance, in a publick and par∣ticular
manner; but as he was a
Man of Council, he thought he
might be singularly useful: in the
more close Consultations which they
had now resolv'd to enter upon, for
the carrying on their Affairs; Be∣sides
which, ORACLE working
too and fro' in his Mind, what use
was to be made of this Engine, who
tho' too weildy to be turn'd about
at Will, yet by its own perverse
Tendency, inclin'd always to move
Retrograde to the publick Good,
if he mov'd at all; he at last
marked out the Orbit of his Motion,
appointed him to be the Head of
the dead Weight for the Church,
and kept him in Petto for a Reserve,
when the Battle should be be∣gun.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
It occur'd to this Church Politici∣an,
that some Advantage might
be made for their new Measures,
from the Discontents of a certain
Northern Peer, who was lately dis∣missed
from great Posts in the Go∣vernment,
as well Military as Ci∣vil:
and it was not a little Pains
that he took, to get proper Agents
to improve the Chagrin they ex∣pected
to find him in, at a Treat∣ment,
which, without Question,
was in its Nature surprising, as it
might be in its Circumstances sud∣den
and unexpected; But as this
was a nice Point to manage, so the
Reverend Father durst trust no
Body with it but himself: but he
met with a Repulse, as we shall
see in its Place.</P>
<P>The mustering up of Agents was
the first Business in Order to settle
a Juncto for their farther Consul∣tations,
and he had been, <HI>as it may
be said, defeated</HI> in the two last men∣tioned,
one being not worth having,
and the other not to be had.</P>
<P><HI>Nabuzaradan</HI> was the next Man;
he was eminent for his Birth,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
Wealth, and many good Qualities;
his Honesty was thought to be so
much greater than his Capacity,
that he was believed to be much
fitter to be trusted, than employed:
his Temper qualified him for a male∣content,
being much sooner offended
than reconcil'd, and was peculiar in
the Manner of his Christianity, in
that, tho' he might sometimes for∣give
an Injury, it was rarely known
that he would ever forget it: had
he been as capable of revenging, as
he was of resenting, no Man that
had ever disoblig'd him, could have
been safe: but as his ill Temper
prevail'd enough in him, to make
him very apt to be angry, so his
good Temper had always Power
enough to keep him from doing
Mischief: The Height of the Sta∣tion
from which he fell was great,
the Fall it self precipitate, and cir∣cumstanced
as much to fire his Re∣sentment,
as could be desir'd: But
as his private Fortunes were great,
and qualified him to fall easy, so
they assisted to keep him so; in a
Word, he had more Gall than
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
Spleen, knew how to be angry, but
not how to be envious; his Genius
was above foul Method of restoring
himself, and a little below the Ma∣nagement
of a fair one.</P>
<P>He was nevertheless a Malecontent,
spoke with Bitterness of the Ministry,
and not with so much Respect of some
others, as his Quality and Duty seem∣ed
to demand: the weaker his parti∣cular
Capacities were suppos'd to be,
the fitter was he to be a Client to
these Sollicitors, and to be drawn in
by the Sorcerer that attack'd him,
and by the Witchcraft of Jacobitism,
even against Inclination; for being once
in the Circle, and taught to speak the
Language of Disaffection; like a wick∣ed
<HI>French</HI> Master, that taught a Lady
his Scholar to talk bawdy, when she
understood nothing of what she said;
so he talk'd Treason before he knew
it was the Brogue of the Party.</P>
<P>Unawares he suffered himself to be
drawn in, but was kept in with
much more Ease than was expected,
by their always keeping from him the
Knowledge of what he was a doing.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39"/>
It was at his House, that the Con∣gress
was appointed; and tho' the
Number was but few, and that they
were all irresolute, who to fix upon, to
fill up the Juncto; yet leaving it to
Fate, and to every Member to bring
such as they found fittest for their
Purpose, it was resolv'd to delay their
Meeting no longer.</P>
<P>It is said among some, who pretend
to Knowledge in the secret History of
these Things; that there were several
other Persons at this Conference, and
some, who do not yet think fit to let
the World know, that they are on
that Side; much less that they are
gone such a Length, as it seems they
are, or as may be guess'd by the Com∣pany
they keep.</P>
<P>That we may avoid Preambles, in
a Discourse of this Consequence, we
shall come to the Meeting it self with∣out
Ceremony: ORACLE presiding,
acquainted them, it is said, in a short
Speech, with the Ocasion of their
meeting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He enlarg'd upon the hard
Usage, which, he said, he was sensible
many of the Persons there present had
received: notwithstanding the good
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
Services they had done, in adhering to
the present Interest, and notwithstand∣ing
they had been so instrumental in
preserving the Succession of the pre∣sent
King and his House: He was about
to touch upon the Easiness of their
having secur'd to themselves better
Usage, if they had thought fit to
have espoused another Interest; but,
as he said, he mentioned it at that
time, not to bring any Thing relating to
that other Interest into their present
Debates, their Eyes being now upon
differing Objects: but to give them a
due Sense of their own Merit, and of
what Reason they had to expect other
things from those, who had the Pow∣er
now in their Hands.</P>
<P>He told them, he would not in his
Introduction give his private Thoughts
of what they were now to consult
of, which he should speak to more
distinctly after they had made some
Entrance into their Business; he only
told them, the grand Affair before
them was, to look into the State of
the Nation, the State of the Church,
their own private Interest, and what it
was they were now to do, in Order to
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
retrieve things in general, save their
Country from Ruin, and the Church
from impending Destruction; he en∣couraged
them to be vigorous in their
Resolves, plain and open in their Opi∣nions,
and assured them, that as he had
an entire Confidence in the Honour
and Sincerity of every one who was
there, and should speak with the
greatest Freedom in whatever he
should say to them, so he hoped they
would have the same Confidence one
in another, that this was no Time to
be backward or diffident, their Cir∣cumstances
were not so desperate, as
to be past hope of Retrieve, or so
forward as not to want the Assistance of
their Friends: and as they were not met
here to form any Insurrection, or to
break in upon the Repose of the Pub∣lick;
but only to think of Methods
within the Compass of their Duty
and Allegiance to the King, to whom
they had all taken the Oaths; and to
restore the Administration into such
Hands, as might put a Stop to the
Oppressions they laboured under, and
preserve the Church and the civil Go∣vernment
also in a flourishing and
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
safe Condition, which he believ'd
they all would allow was far from
the present State of Things.</P>
<P>Hereupon he sat down, beckning
to <HI>Nigroq.</HI> to speak his Mind, who
standing up, and directing his Speech
to the Bishop, seem'd to go on where
his Lordship left off: “My Lord, <HI>said
he,</HI> I was glad to hear your Lord∣ship
mention, that we are not met
here upon dishonourable or disloyal
Designs, for this is agreeable to my
Notion of the Thing, we are not
going to levy War, or raise Rebel∣lion;
we have nothing to say of the
Government it self, or the Person
of the King: When we come to
transact any Thing with, or relating
to the Person of his Majesty, I be∣lieve
every one here would act as
becomes him. I see several Persons
of Honour here, who have always
spoken honourably and dutifully of
the King, and have served him faith∣fully,
and are ready to do so again,
when his Majesty shall please to open
the Door, that they may do it, as
they think they ought.”</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43"/>
“But it is our Misfortune, that we
cannot have the same Opinion of
those, into whose Hands the Admi∣nistration
of Affairs is now entrust∣ed,
which we had formerly. We
think they neither act wisely or
faithfully; we think neither Church
nor State safe in such Hands: especi∣ally,
my Lord, <HI>said he, directing his
Speech again to the Bishop,</HI> the
Church can never be secure in such
Measures as these Men take, dis∣couraging
the zealous Defenders of
her Interest, who have given many
Years Testimony of their Fidelity
to her Cause, and Zeal for her Wor∣ship
and Authority, harbouring, nou∣rishing,
and supporting Phanaticks
and Presbyterians, gratifying the
Dissenters upon all Occasions, stop∣ping
legal Prosecutions against such
of them, as by their vile Pamphlets
insult the Church, of which we have
so many Examples, that we need not,
as well as have not Time, to enter
into Particulars: and therefore our
Business, as I take it, is, to consider
of Mensures to get such Hands re∣moved
from the King, or, as we
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
usually express it, to have the King
put into better Hands. I need not
explain my self, my Lord, I believe
there is none in this honourable
Company but understands: here he
made a Bow to all the Lords round,
whose Number by this Time was en∣creased
to no less than eleven, includ∣ing
<HI>Monoculus</HI> and two Lords who he
had bought in with him.”</P>
<P>One of these taking the Hint from
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> carryed on the Discourse,
tho with a little more Warmth
than the other: He complimented
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> upon his concise Method, in
opening the Case with an Eloquence,
as he said, peculiar to his Illustrious
Family, and upon his coming so di∣rectly
to the Point in hand; he feli∣citated
himself upon his being ad∣mitted
to a Conference among Per∣sons
so entirely affected to their com∣mon
Interest, and to their Country's
Good, and especially to the Safety
and Honour of the Church: at which
Words, he made a Bow to the <HI>Ora∣cle;</HI>
but more particularly he bless'd
his Fate, that he came in Time to hear
his Lordship lead them by the
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Hand, so plainly to the Business they
were met about, he told them, that it
had this Effect upon him, and believ'd
it had the same upon all the rest:
That they had now nothing to do, but
to enter upon Measures, for bringing
to pass a new Turn among the Mana∣gers
of publick Business, and setting
proper Instruments at work for bring∣ing
it to pass: That true it was, some
Measures had been wrong taken, and
some Men had carried things too far:
but yet he hoped there might be some
Steps yet to be taken, which might
bring about what they desir'd, if not
presently, yet in a reasonable Time:
and he desir'd that every one would
give their Advice with Freedom in
the present Exigence, and that they
might be led into no more Precipitati∣ons:
That their Strength was not
broken, tho' they were as it were
disarm'd; and that they had many
ways to render themselves considera∣ble,
if not formidable, to the Court
Party; and that this was their present
Business.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> spoke next, and said he
was so pleased with what that noble
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
Lord had said, and so sensible that he
had digested these Things thoroughly
in his Thoughts, that he could not
but be of the Opinion, that it was the
Desire of the whole Board, that he
would be pleased to go on, and that
he would enter into such Explanati∣ons,
of what he had suggested in ge∣neral,
as his Lordship shall think pro∣per;
all the Lords bowed at the
Word, signifying their Assent, upon
which the other proceeded; He told
them since it was their Pleasure he
should explain himself, he did it wil∣lingly,
in Hopes it would lead them
into the Bottom of their Design, and
that they would speak their Thoughts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reely, as they came to the particulars;
he told them that as to the wrong
Measures which had been taken,
he thought he need not to have ex∣plained
it; their Lordships knew very
well that some Gentlemen, who were
heartily in the Interest, had driven
things on to an open Rupture, which
was quite foreign to the thing: That
their Business had been to have knit
themselves in a solid Interest at Court,
where they might have gradually,
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
and wisely, yet silently and sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely
have proceeded; that every Man they
gain'd there was better than a Regi∣ment
beaten in the Field; that this
Establishment was too firmly fixed,
to be cut up with the Sword; the mak∣ing
a formidable Appearance at Court,
and in the Parliament, was better to
them, and a likelier way to Success,
than raising an Army: That they had
rather have a Majority of ten in the
House of Lords, or Commons, than of
Ten Thousand in the Field; and had
much better bring over one Privy-Counsellor,
than take the strongest
Garrison in <HI>Britain</HI> by Storm; “that
therefore taking to Arms was the
wrongest Step in the World, and
served only to ruin their Friends,
not encrease them; to make their
Work more difficult, not more ea∣sy:
That it was all owing to the
Precipitation of People abroad, who
were not only impatient of their own
Misfortunes, but apt to promise
more from their Interests there, and
expect more from their Friends here,
than either they were capable, or
than ever it was probable they should
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
produce: He told them, that it was
his Opinion, that raising a War, was
what their Enemies desired above
all things, as the surest Way to over∣throw
the private Interest which
they saw was too growing; and tho'
he would not believe his Majesty
could entertain such cruel Thoughts
to a Nation, that he expected should
one time or other be peaceably his
own; yet he could answer for it,
that they were not a few that de∣sired
a Conquest, rather than an Union
of Parties; that placed all their
Expectation of their own Settlement
upon the Destruction of the Gen∣try,
Nobility, and Clergy, of the
other Side; and to fly to Arms, was
the greatest Gratification of those
Peoples Desire that could be; that
he thought the Friends of those A∣broad,
pushed us upon playing a
desperate Game at Home, before
our Circumstances were reduced to
the Necessity of it; that it was ap∣parent
things went well enough on
before, and nothing seemed to
stand in the way of their growing
Expectations, till some impatient
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
People broke out into Tumults and
Rabbles, and so by Consequence to
Arms, before their Friends were
ready for them: That the Rebellion
was a Plot defeated, not a War de∣signed,
like the Story of the Gun∣powder
Treason, where when <HI>Faux</HI>
was taken, and the Mine under the
<HI>Parliament House</HI> discovered, the
rest desperately run to Arms, with∣out
Probability of Success, and were
defeated of Course: That the Earl of
<HI>Mar</HI> spoiled all the Measures at
Home, and the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> A∣broad;
and had done ten times
more Service to the Interest, had
they lain still, as Lord <HI>Boling broke</HI> did,
and advised them to do; he re∣ferred
it to their Lordships to look
back upon the Posture their Affairs
were in before these unhappy Mea∣sures
were entred into: <HI>Was not,</HI>
my Lords, continued he, <HI>the Coun∣try
all our own? in some Counties, the
Clergy, the Gentry, ours to a Man?
Did not the Disaffection encrease in
all Places to our Satisfaction? Was not
the Country every where alarmed,
with the evident Dangers of the
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
Church? And could we desire to stand
in a better Posture at Court for the
Time it held? Were not many of us
in the Administration, at least in the
Councils and Cabinet? Were we not
posted within Doors, where we saw
every thing that was done, and knew
every Step that was taken, and knew
thereby how to suit things without
Doors to the great Event we aimed
at? Was not this,,</HI> my Lords, <HI>a pro∣mising
Scene? Were we not encreasing
every Day in Numbers, and Inte∣rest?
What need was there of Pre∣cipitations
and Ruptures, to put Arms
into our Enemies Hands with which
to destroy our Friends, when we might
have gradually and silently done all
at Home, and have at last given the</HI>
Coup de Grace <HI>at our own Plea∣sure</HI>?”</P>
<P>“He put them in Mind, how the
Tumults first, and the War after∣wards,
effectually broke into their
Measures: how the falling upon the
Meeting-Houses, inflamed all the
Dissenters at one Blow against them,
just said he, when we had laid a
Scheme either effectually to have
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
brought them in to be Malecontents,
or at least to have divided them a∣mong
themselves, and so have had
them some on one Side, some on the
other, <HI>which was,</HI> said he, <HI>to make
them be perfectly useless to both.</HI>”</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>said he,</HI> we made the best
of that Affair, by putting forward as
much as possible that Vote of rebuilding
the Dissenters Meeting-Houses at the
publick Expence, which we afterwards
fail'd not to improve in the Country,
by the Assistance of the Gentlemen and
Clergy, to satisfie the People that the
Church could never be thought to be
the Concern of those, who so publickly
espoused her Enemies the Presbyteri∣ans.</P>
<P>“However he added, that this went
but a little way, compared to the
Injury that those Tumults did, by
carrying the Dissenters and all the
moderate Gentlemen away from them,
and therefore as he told them, they
could not but remember, they were
fain to conceal their Thoughts, and
joyn in against Rabbles of all Kinds
in general, as Things which all
Men, who desir'd to preserve the
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
Peace of their Country must equally
abhor; he told them it was plain
they were driven to the same Exi∣gence
by the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and others
taking up Arms, which was indeed
the Ruin of all their Designs; and
which they could not but declare
against, and joyn their Assistance to
oppose, unless they would have been
ruin'd with them, and have put
themselves into the same Predica∣ment
with those in Arms: he told
them, by that one rash Enter∣prise,
abundance of the Gentry,
who would have been more useful
another way, were ensnar'd, hurried
into Jayls, or driven to declare
themselves in meer Desperation, as
was the Case of Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> and
others in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Sir <HI>W—W—</HI>
Mr. <HI>H—</HI> and several o∣thers
at Home, to the weakning the
Interest, on which better Measures
were laid, and to the putting a full
Stop to all the Schemes they had
then laid for the propagating an
Interest another way.”</P>
<P>This Discourse was so lively, so
much to the Purpose, and touched
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
them all so sensibly, that it was ea∣sily
seen, even in the very Countenan∣ces
of the whole Body, that it was
very agreeable to them: and fre∣quently,
upon his offering to stop, they
cryed, <HI>Go on, my Lord, Pray go on, my
Lord.</HI> He answer'd, <HI>Pray, my Lords,
let some Body give their Opinions as
well as I;</HI> says one that sat right
against him, <HI>you speak all our Opinions,
we entreat you to go on, my Lord;</HI> upon
these Pressings, he continued his Dis∣course,
and “told them, one of the
great Mischiefs these Tumults and
this Rebellion, <HI>for such he said it
was to them, as well as to the Govern∣ment,</HI>
had brought upon them, were
the repealing the <HI>Triennial Bill,</HI>
for as for that of suspending the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, though it fell
heavy upon some of their Friends,
yet he told them they could not
blame the Court for taking that
Step, and that it was nothing but
what every Government had done
in their Turn, and would, and ought
to do again upon such Occasions;
and being temporary, would influ∣ence
Matters but a little while;
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
<HI>But this cursed Septennial Law,</HI> said
he, <HI>your Lordships are sensible has
ruined us all;</HI> Before that, <HI>he told
them,</HI> they had some View of retrie∣ving
the Mischiefs which the wrong
Steps of the Rebellion and Rabbling
had brought upon them; and tho'
they had lost some Friends, and ma∣ny
had brought themselves into such
Circumstances, as they could not
own them without manifest Dan∣ger,
yet they had cultivated the
general Disaffection to such a De∣gree,
that upon a new Election of
Parliament, they made no doubt to
have given a new Turn to the
Gentlemen at Court, and to have
let his Majesty see, THAT <HI>the Inte∣rest
of the Church did not lye where
some People had placed it:</HI> THAT <HI>the</HI>
High-Party <HI>were not so despicable an
Interest as they had been represented:</HI>
THAT <HI>it was not safe to slight them,
as some Men would have them slight∣ed:</HI>
and in a Word, <HI>THAT it was
his Interest to shift Hands in the Ad∣ministration,
if he would effectually
regain the Affection of his Subjects.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55"/>
He went on here relating some of
the secret Measures they had laid for
a Court Revolution, which, at pre∣sent,
our Author cannot so exactly re∣member,
but says he repeated them
much more regularly afterwards in
the Measures he proposed for their
future Conduct, and therefore they
were omitted in this Part, he conclud∣ed
thus: <HI>But,</HI> my Lords, <HI>the Court
falling upon this unlucky Expedient,
has broken all those Measures;</HI> at least <HI>it
has adjourned them for five Years; which
is a terrible Length for Expectations, in
which we have so much Reason to be im∣patient.</HI></P>
<P>Having gone this Length, he made
a little Stop, and then told them, “that
to be short, their present Work was
not to be discouraged by any Disap∣pointment
they had met with; but to
restore the Breach by effectual Ap∣plications,
and to enter into speedy
Measures for re-establishing themselves
at Court, where, he said, it was his
Opinion, if they could but once
make their Way again into the Ad∣minisiration,
the Credit and Inte∣rest
of their Party in the Country
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
would encrease, and they should be
in such a Posture, as never to be re∣duced
again by the Whigs; for that
without the Concurrence of the
King, the Whig Interest was in it
self nothing; and if once the Court
came to be made sensible of it, and
to think fit to change Hands,
would dwindle into just what it
was before, <HI>viz.</HI> a despicable Faction of
Atheists, Hereticks, and Presbyteri∣ans;
So that upon the whole, he
told them, they had nothing to do
but to endeavour to restore their
Interest at Court, and the Game
was all their own; and this he said
he supposed, was the Business of
their present Meeting.”</P>
<P><HI>Oracle</HI> had heard this with much
Pleasure, but was so full of the Cause,
that he had scarce Patience to hold:
But my Lord ..... making a full
Stop, he told them, “that they were
now come into the Heart of the
Work; that the Noble Person who had
been speaking, had clearly stated all
their Preliminaries, and made so full
an Introduction to their Affair, that
nothing remained but to begin im∣mediately
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
upon the Scheme, and
that as he knew another noble
Lord, who he pointed out, by di∣recting
his Speech to him; had
drawn up some Heads for their
Conduct, and for their present Pro∣ceedings,
with the Names of Per∣sons,
of whom something was to be
said, he hoped his Lordship would
further open the Conference, by
laying it before them; this was
done, and contained among other
Things, the following Particulars.”</P>
<P>1. To consider of Persons proper
to be talked with, and on
whom 'tis probable some In∣fluence
might be expected,
from late Disgraces on one
Hand, or little Discoveries of
Dissatisfaction on the other.</P>
<P>2. To cultivate the Dissatisfacti∣ons
of the People in the Coun∣try,
and to consider how to
make the Danger of the Church
more popular.</P>
<P>3. To form a List of such Per∣sons,
who on a Turn at Court
are proper to be brought in;
and to acquaint them with
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
their being named, as the effe∣ctual
Way to make them more
heartily espouse the Design.</P>
<P>4. To consider of some Person,
who may with all possible Re∣spect,
getting Access to the
King and Prince, counter-act
our Enemies, and fully per∣swade
his Majesty of our being
hearty in his Interest, as well
as the only Party power∣ful
enough to support it.</P>
<P>When these Heads were read in the
Meeting, they began to look upon
one another, as if they had been in
some Consternation, and it was easy
to see that their Thoughts concurr'd
in this, <HI>viz.</HI> that they had a difficult
Work before them.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus,</HI> Part of whose Chara∣cter,
as has been noted, was to avoid
all things difficult, as well as Things
dangerous, appear'd very despond∣ing
upon these Proposals: He told them
that he was very sensible that these
were very just Measures, but that
some of them were impracticable,
and especially the last, which related
to the Person of the King: He said he
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
was very sensible that the Interest of
the Whigs depended very much upon
the Favour the present Ministry en∣joyed
at Court, and the Interest they
had in the King's good Opinion; and
that on the other Hand it must be
acknowledged, the Conduct of the
High Church had been such, and so
imprudent since the Accession, that
if the King had entertained mean
Thoughts of them before, he must
necessarily be confirmed in them now,
and he could assure them, the Steadi∣ness
of the King to his Interest was
as firm, as his Judgment to know his
Interest was clear; and therefore he
could not advise the making any such
Attempt upon the King, at least till
they were able to support their
Address with one of these two Things.
1. An Evidence of their Superiority
in Parliament. Or, 2. of some male
Administrations in the Ministry; as
to the first, they were, he said, adjourn∣ed
by the new Septennial Act, to such
a Distance, as that there was no
Room to think of it yet; <HI>as to the last,</HI>
he did not think it impossible to bring
to pass, and should not be backward
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
<HI>when it was,</HI> to improve it to their
Disadvantage, even with the King
himself, as far as Duty and Decency
would permit.</P>
<P>Here a Noble Lord, more fam'd for
Wit than Honesty, stood up, speaking
in a most diverting Stile; said, MY
LORDS, <HI>I think his</HI> Grace <HI>has put
the Case very right, about our Applica∣tion
to the King:</HI> indeed we have ma∣ny
Reasons against it, “his Majesty
must have a better Opinion of us
than he has yet, or perhaps than
we are like to merit from him, be∣fore
you can expect any Favour
there: And as we can seek nothing
of the King, but with the utmost
Respect, Deference, and Duty; so
I am very loth we should come to
his Majesty, as the Gentlemen do
to the <HI>French</HI> King for the blue
Ribband: with <HI>Domine non sum
dignus:</HI> If you have any Thing to
charge upon the Ministry that has
Weight in it, I think every one would
go on that Errand, and might be
sure to be heard: But as the King
has too much Sense of Govern∣ment,
not to hear a fair Charge; so
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
he has too much Penetration to be
trifled with; but methinks you
should not think the Ministry such
infallible People, that they shall ne∣ver
be taken in a Mistake; for my
Part, I neither think them so quick,
or you so dull, but that they may
be first drawn into a Slip, and then
snapt in it.”</P>
<P><HI>Hum</HI> says <HI>Oracle: Hum</HI> says the
Lord that spoke the Introduction, and
added, “that it was his Opinion, that
the Sum of all they had left for it,
was contained in what that Lord
had said: He told them that there
had very seldom been a Ministry in
the <HI>English</HI> Court, but had acted so
unwarily, whether by the Error of
their Employments, that they might
easily be fallen upon by them that
came next. He told them there was
an eminent Lord of the last Age,
who used to say, that if any Noble∣man
was willing to be of the con∣trary
Party, there was always Room
to come in and find Fault with
the Ministry; and that he would un∣dertake
to impeach, if he thought
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
fit, all the Secretaries of State, Trea∣surers,
and Presidents of the Coun∣cil,
that had been since the Restora∣tion;
that as this was their
present Work, they had nothing to
do, but to concert Measures to fall up∣on
the Ministry, that bringing
them into Disgrace, they might, as
had been the known Practice of
former Times, fill their Places up
with such Men as they had reserv'd
in Petto, to speak of in their Turn.”</P>
<P>Here a certain Lord stood up, who
had not spoken yet, for whose Descri∣ption
this may suffice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he
is a general Exception to that Maxim
in Physiognomy, <HI>that to go with the
Mouth open is the certain Sign of a
Fool:</HI> He took them up short, and
“told them, he wondred to see them
fall so earnestly upon the last Head
of the Propositions first; he added,
that he thought it was a little omi∣nous,
that they should begin at the
wrong End of their Work, and set
their Scheme with the Bottom up∣ward:
That he hoped they would not
go on at that Rate all the Way: He
said, he observed that the first thing
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
mentioned in the Propositions, was
what indeed was first in the Nature
of the Thing, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to try to form
themselves into a Body as a Party; to
encrease their Numbers, and make
themselves formidable, by getting
over as many to their Party as they
could; and he wondered, he said,
they should not take hold of every
Man that Fate threw in their Way,
for Advantages given were always
to be taken; that it was an old
Maxim in <HI>Machiavell,</HI> that <HI>falling
Favourites are the Beginners of Fa∣ction.</HI>
That in Order to overthrow
the present Ministry, their only
Way was, to make themselves pow∣erful
by Numbers; he concluded
thus, and <HI>is there not a Man just
now fallen from the highest Pinnacle
of Favour! Can you think,</HI> my
Lords, <HI>he has no Resentment, or
that he believes he had no Merit?</HI>”</P>
<P>“ORACLE took up this Discourse
immediately, and replyed, that his
Lordship aim'd right, and his Re∣proof
had been just, if he had it
not to assure him, that Care was
taken to tamper with every Man,
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
that gave the least Reason to think
he was in the least sower'd or Cha∣grin
in his Prospects; and that they
had snapt them all up as fast as
they dropt, except 2 or 3, who
they found undocible, and not
capable of receiving due Impressions:
That particularly, for the great
Man he mentioned, he had not
failed first by proper Instruments,
and at last by himself, to attack him
with all possible Skill; but found
him either in such Hopes of retrieving
his Fortunes, as Occasion should of∣fer,
or so insensible of his Mortifica∣tions,
that he appear'd inflexible to
all that could be offer'd; and <HI>when I
found nothing else would work,</HI> said
Oracle, <HI>I attacked him with this im∣portunate
Question:</HI> My Lord, <HI>I
hope</HI> your Grace <HI>will be a Friend
to THE CHƲRCH;</HI> He turn'd up∣on
his Heel, and with an Air of
Contempt answered me, <HI>Always,</HI> my
Lord, <HI>when the Church is so to her
self:</HI> and giving me no Time to
reply, walked away; <HI>so I presently
gave him up for a lost Man on both
Sides,</HI> (viz.) one that could stand
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
still and see himself ..... used, and
had no Sense of entring into Mea∣sures
to restore himself, at the Ex∣pence
of those that turn'd him out,
and one that had not Affection
enough for the Church to take
Share with us in her Interests.”</P>
<P>“He went on to tell them, that
finding that great Man, tho' dis∣placed
in Publick, yet hankering
about the Court, and frequently
paying his Compliment to a certain
Prince, at least in publick; it brought
to his Memory the Story of an
<HI>English▪</HI> Prince, who entertained his
Favourite <HI>Gaveston,</HI> contrary to his
Father's Injunctions: and this put a
Thought in his Head, which, he said,
he acknowledged had some ill Na∣ture,
if not some Treason in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
whether the said Prince, in Grati∣fication
of his own Inclinations,
might not be brought to do some
disobliging Thing in the Case of
his Favourite, and that so some
Misunderstanding might be pro∣duced
between the two Chief
Heads of the Government:
But he acknowledged, that upon
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
Reflection, he not only found that
the Prince was too wise, and better
advised, than to do any Thing
which looked that Way; but, on the
contrary, acted with such Prudence,
such Caution, such Deference to his
Father's Measures, and such Detesta∣tion
of every Thing that looked
undutiful or unkind, that there was
no Room to hope for it; and on the
other Hand, the Thought looked
so horrid, so unchristian, and in
its own Nature so treasonable, that
he (<HI>Oracle</HI>) said he could not bear
to reflect on it himself; and therefore
he told them he hoped they would
find better Measures than any of
these to think on, and which he
made no Question would offer to
them in the serious Enquiry they
were upon.”</P>
<P><HI>Nigroq.</HI> smiled at this Discourse;
for though he politically acquiesced in
the general Detestation of the Thing
it self, yet he seemed to intimate as
if he would have made no Scruple to
sow Divisions and Dissatisfactions of
the worst kind, even in the Royal
Family it self, if it had been possible,
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
and if it might have answered the
End another Way; but seeing it was
not likely to succeed, all that knew
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> will acknowledge it was not
likely he should not condemn it.</P>
<P><HI>It came before them to consider of
the second Head,</HI> (viz.) To cultivate
the Dissatisfactions of the People in the
Country, and to consider how to make
the Apprehensions of the Danger of the
Church more popular.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> shook his Head at that
Expression, <HI>the Danger of the Church!</HI>
“He told them he wisht they
would consider of some more pro∣per
Engine than this, for that this
had been canvassed up and down,
and dwelt upon till it grew stale,
and had not that Effect upon the
People as it would have, if it was
let sleep in the Grave of Forget∣fulness
for a few Years; then he
said it might have a Resurrection,
and come in Play again; but that
now he really thought it was worn
quite out.”</P>
<P>“<HI>He told them further,</HI> that the
Clergy themselves began to be sur∣feited
with it; the People, were
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
sick of it, and it would not go any
farther in most Places of the Coun∣try;
but that which was very par∣ticular
he told them, Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> and some of the Ja∣cobite
Clergy, had now entred in∣to
a Debate, even with the <HI>High-Church</HI>
it self; charging them all
with <HI>Heresie</HI> and <HI>Schism;</HI> affirming
that the true Church of <HI>England</HI> re∣mained
only with the <HI>Nonjurors:</HI>
This, <HI>he said,</HI> had so alarmed, and
disobliged the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI>
unchurching them all at one Blow;
that they were all entring upon a
new Strife about it one with ano∣ther,
and that here only the apparent
<HI>Danger to the Church</HI> was to be seen.”</P>
<P>HERE he gave himself a loose, to
exclaim against the Nonjurors, charg∣ing
them with Ingratitude to those,
who had done so many obliging
Things for them; alledging that even
this Notion of the Danger of the
Church, was it self begun and car∣ried
on, to serve them, and had
done them Service, though there
might be some other Ends in the
pushing it on: But for them to turn
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
the Tables upon the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and at once to disown her,
and reproach all her Clergy as Schis∣maticks;
was not only unkind, but
foolish; and opened the Mouths of
the Whigs, to lay the Danger of the
Church at their Door, and that in a
manner which could not be deny∣ed;
all these Things, he said, urged
them to lay aside the Notion of the
Danger of the Church at this Time;
and therefore he was for considering
of some Equivalent.</P>
<P>My Lord—seconded this
Motion, and told them he was of the
same Mind, as to the Danger of the
Church; besides, he said the People, as
he thought, began on both Sides to have
no great Concern for the Thing,
or so much as to enquire, whether
the Church was in Danger or no: But
the Difficulty was, what popular
thing to trump up in the Room of
it.</P>
<P><HI>Nigroq.</HI> told them, he wondered any
one should think to break an old
Proverb, that 'twas always easy to
find a Stone to throw at a Dog; that
he never expected to find this Nation
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
in so happy a Condition, that there
should be nothing to find Fanlt with;
that as long as Kings administred their
Affairs by Servants and Statesmen;
the People would never want Oppres∣sions
to cry out of, and Grievances
to complain of.</P>
<P>The Lord who came with <HI>Monoculus</HI>
put in here, and said, “he under∣stood
easily what they all meant,
but wondred to see they were all
so shy of speaking plain <HI>English:</HI>
He hoped, <HI>he said,</HI> they had no
Apprehensions or Distrust about
them of any one that was there; if
they had, they were all in the
wrong to have said so much, and
himself in particular: And if they
had not, the Want of Freedom and
Plainness would be the Ruin of all
their Designs; That for his Part,
he had begun to speak plainly, and
would go on so: <HI>that it was true,</HI>
the Notion of the Danger of the
Church, was grown a <HI>by Word;</HI>
That the Whigs began to upbraid them
with it, and tell them that such and
such Things were done, so many Years
were lapsed, so many Whig Sessions
of Parliament over, so many Troops
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
raised, so many Months the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> Bill suspended, so long King
<HI>George</HI> had reign'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet the
Church stood where it did still; He
told them however, that they were not
to give that Point up, for that it was
really fact that the Church was in
Danger, and he did not doubt, but
it would appear at some Time or
other. “<HI>But now,</HI> said he, <HI>we must
turn our Discourse to other Things:</HI>
Then he descended to Particulars,
and concluded that, in a Word, <HI>they
must form a Party at Court:</HI> He
added, that the Ministry are to be
blacken'd and exposed; we cannot
doubt, said he, but that they
will give us Room enough to lay
hold of them by, <HI>I do not know,</HI>
said he, <HI>whether it be in their Power
to prevent it, or whether they, or any
Ministry, ever managed without giving
sufficient Ground to expose and depose
them.</HI> This then must be our Bu∣siness.”</P>
<P>“Well,
<HI>said Monoculus,</HI> but then
you must assign some Ground for
this; you cannot fall upon them
without some Pretence; and I assure
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
you, the Ministry are Men that
will not easily be snared.”</P>
<P>That must be left to Time, said
the other Lord; but in the mean
Time, says he, if I understand our
Present Work right, it was to be
one Part of our Work now, to consi∣der
of WHO, and WHO, should be
appointed to succeed the present Mini∣stry:
He added, that he would recom∣mend
it to them, to think of Persons
that were acceptable to the King, ca∣pable
of Business, and not too unpo∣pular,
and that none should be na∣med,
especially at first, who were in
the least obnoxious to the hottest Part
of the Whigs; that had ever been
Favourers of the Pretender, or Abet∣tors,
or so much as Countenancers of
the late Disturbances; we may alter
them afterwards, <HI>says he,</HI> as we see
Cause.</P>
<P>I like all that well, <HI>says Oracle,</HI>
whatever we mean; and he added,
that he did not doubt, but that some
Gentlemen there, were come pro∣vided
with Lists of such Names as they
thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73"/>
Upon this, several pulled out
Papers, in which divers Names were
put in; but as they differed very
much in their Lists, and that some Men
were put in, which, it is very probable,
had never been consulted in the Case;
and above all, because the Relator
hereof cannot charge his Memory
with the Particulars of so many
Names, the said Lists are omitted.</P>
<P>It is true, there being some longer
Debates upon one List, and some
Names in it for the particular Offices of
Secretary of State, and the Treasury,
it was easier to recollect; and the
Author remembers, that my Lord
<HI>Cb</HI>—was named there, with
Mr. <HI>Br</HI>—as Secretaries of State:
and Mr. <HI>Bri</HI>—for first Com∣missioner
of the Treasury; these
were said to be named as unquesti∣onable
Persons, and such as between
all Parties, would give the least Um∣brage
of Discontent.</P>
<P>Not but that in reading over the
several Lists, the Author says, there
was not a Place of Profit or Trust,
or a Post of Honour in the Court,
Army or Navy, but new Men were
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
named to them, and the Relator on∣ly
wondered, they had not named a
new Man for the first Post of all,
and brought out a new King too;
because then the Turn would have
been universal and effectual, as one
of them expressed it.</P>
<P>The Discourse upon these Lists
was very long, and scarce a Man was
named, whose Character did not ad∣mit
of such Exceptions, as after a
little Discourse, obliged them to lay
him aside; so that at last, they had
fixed on but very few, the Princi∣pal
of whom are as above.</P>
<P>The Debates now began to draw
to a Close, and especially after what
a certain Lord Duke moved, upon the
Subject of entring, or not entring
immediately upon these Measures;
first he asked them, if they had no∣thing
to charge upon the Court-Managers
just now to begin with, that
they might attack them upon the
Spot; that they might have some
Time to expose them to the People
first; and then at the King's Arrival,
they might represent the Ministry as
hateful to the Nation, and under
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
whose Conduct, the People were
made uneasy.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus,</HI> a Friend to doing nothing,
told them, that Lord had moved
well, but there were two unhappy
Circumstances which rendered it
difficult to offer at that Matter at
this Time: <HI>One was,</HI> the Advance
of the publick Credit, which just
then was run up to such a Height,
whether by the Nature of Things,
or by the Arts of the Managers, he
could not determine; as that the like
had not been known for many Years;
and they knew, he said, that the
rising or falling of publick Credit
was always given as a Test of the
Easiness or Uneasiness of the Peo∣ple
under the Administration; and
therefore had ordinarily been made
use of, for, or against the Ministry,
in all Reigns, as an Argument of
their good or ill Management. (2.)
<HI>The other was,</HI> the setting on foot a
Treaty of Alliance with <HI>France,</HI>
which if it succeeded, would at this
Time give the Ministry but too great
a Reputation for managing Things
abroad, and for their Penetration in
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
the Affairs of Foreign Countries; That
tho' nothing was more true, than that
all that Part was owing to the Di∣rection
of the King himself, and
might have been done, and indeed
would have been done, though
the Ministry had been Ideots; yet
however, it was likewise very cer∣tain,
that as when Things go ill,
the Ministry have the Blame among
the People, whether they merit an
ill Word or no: so on the con∣trary,
when Success answers Abroad
or at Home, it redounds to the
Honour and Advantage of the
Ministry, though perhaps they had
no Hand at all in the conducting of
them.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, says
<HI>Oracle,</HI> your Grace does not think
it a proper Time to fall upon the
Ministry NOW; I assure you, I am of a
contrary Opinion.</P>
<P>A grave Person of Honour, whose
Years added more to the Weight of
what he said, than his Judgment, told the
Meeting, he was of Opinion, they were
in the Right to resolve to attack
the Ministry as soon as they had a
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
fair Charge against them, but hoped
for their own Sakes they would take
Care not to begin till they were
sure the Blow could not be warded
off; and therefore moved that they
should consider very well upon that
Part before they began.</P>
<P>Another moved, that a Meeting
should be appointed to draw Heads
of Articles, it having been suggest∣ed
that some in the Company were
backward to offer particulars, but in
a more private Manner, and that
therefore a secret Committee should
be appointed.</P>
<P><HI>Quinquhan</HI> had hitherto silently
lissened to all the grave Speeches of
the Assembly, and if he had said any
Thing, it was only in whisper to such
as sat next him, but had taken Notes
of all that had been said; and find∣ing
every Man had given his Opi∣nion,
at least every one that in∣tended
it: He took up his Notes,
and looking upon them, as if he
was going to sum up the Cause,
and to read something out of his
Paper, he began with recapitulating
the End and Design of that Meeting,
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
which was, as he call'd it, to observe
at what Gap they might break in
upon the present Administration; He
told them, it was evident Force was
not their Work, our rash Friends,
says he, have done us Harm in that
Part; but thank Heaven we have
no other Share in their Misfortunes;
and with that he smiled a litle.</P>
<P>He told them, he found some had
been in Hopes to keep up the Fer∣ment
of the People by Mobbs and
Rabbles, but he thought that Way
would never do; because the Govern∣ment
would always fall upon the
People with Force; and though at
first, the Gallows and the Lash
would but exasperate, yet there be∣ing
no Help at Hand, the People
would cool and be discouraged: So
that upon the whole, says he, <HI>I do
not see that the Ministry can be brok∣en
in upon that Way.</HI> As for the Dan∣ger
of the Church, he told them,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found they were all of the Opi∣nion
that it was a thread-bare Com∣plaint,
had been made use of as
long as there was any tolerable
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
Room for it, and that being now
worn out, it should sleep a while,
and keep cold, and he added, that
he was of the same Mind.</P>
<P>As to the other Measures, he
said, he found all that they pro∣posed
might come to this: That they
should set up what was formerly
called the Country Party, against the
Court; which indeed had formerly
been practised with Success, but that
Things were at present in such a
Posture, by the Steddiness of the
Prince, and the Vigilance of the
Ministry, that he did not see Room
for any Thing to be done that
Way, and that therefore he could
give them no Encouragement.</P>
<P><HI>Nil desperandum,</HI> said ORACLE,
wise Men never despair of any
Thing. Adding, that though he
was not so much in Hast to preci∣pitate
Things before their Time; yet
he was not so flegmatick as his
Grace was, who spoke last; the
Church, he said, had a strong Par∣ty
still, and always would have so;
and as their Interest was already
good, though something dispersed
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
by the late Disorders, yet he did
not doubt but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Time to retrieve
Things, and so proposed three Parti∣culars
to them.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That seeing Things did
not appear so easy and
practicable now, as it was
hoped they might do in
a little longer Time, they
should therefore defer their
Proceeding to another Op∣portunity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That nevertheless they
should not fail to corre∣spond
with their Friends
in all Parts, to cultivate
their Interests, and increase
their Party.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That in the mean Time,
they should offer the pre∣sent
Ministry all the Af∣fronts,
Distrubances, and
Uneasiness they could, so
as not to bring themselves
within the Reach of their
Power.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/>
They had several other petty Re∣solves;
such as that they would up∣on
all Occasions encourage R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbits,
Tumults, Libels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> against the
Government, but especially against
the Ministers of State: That every
Thing as might serve to keep up the
Spirit of Discontent among the Peo∣ple,
should be diligently watched for, and
propagated: That the septennial Bill
may be of as little Use as possible, and
the Whigs may be as certain to lose
their Aim at the next Election as
they did before.</P>
<P>There were no Debates upon any
of these Heads, but the first; some en∣deavoured
to keep up their Spirits a
while, but after some few Discourses,
it was unanimously resolv'd in the
Affirmative, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that as things now
stood, there was nothing could be
done, and that therefore it was pro∣per
to wait a fairer Opportunity; and
so the Assembly broke up.</P>
