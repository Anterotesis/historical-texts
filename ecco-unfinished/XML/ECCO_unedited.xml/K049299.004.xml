<P>The commanders of his majesty's forces and fleets in North-America and the West-Indies, have transmitted cer∣tain and repeated intelli∣gences, of an illegal and most pernicious trade carried on by the king's subjects in North-America and the West-Indies, as well to the French islands as to the French set∣tlements on the continent in America▪ and particularly to the rivers M bile and Missis∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; by which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the great reproach and de∣triment of government, are supplied with provisions and other necessaries; whereby they are principally, if not alone, enabled to sustain and protract this long and expen∣sive war. And it further ap∣pearing, that large sums of bullion are sent by the king's subjects to the above places, in return whereof commodi∣ties are taken, which inter∣fere with the product of the British colonies themselves, in open contempt of the au∣thority of the mother-coun∣try, as well as the most ma∣nifest prejudice of the manu∣factures and trade of Great Britain. In order, therefore, to put the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost speedy and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p to such flagiti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so utterly sub∣versive of all laws, and so highly repugnant to the well-being of this kingdom:</P>

And you will as soon as may be, and from time to time, transmit to me, for the king's information, full and particular accounts of the pro∣gress you shall have made in the execution of this his majesty's commands; to the which the king expects that you pay the most exact obedience. And you are further to use your utmost endeavours to trace out and investigate the various artifices and evasions by which the dealers in this iniquitous intercourse find means to cover their criminal proceedings, and to elude the law; in order that from such lights due and timely consi∣derations may be had, what farther provision may be ne∣cessary to restrain an evil of such extensive and pernicious consequences.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="40"/>
of extraordinary profit excited the merchants<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760</NOTE> not only to assist the enemies of their country, but also to run all risques in eluding the vigilance of the legislature. The inhabitants of Martinique found a plentiful market of provision furnished by the British subjects at the Dutch islands of Eustatia and Curaçoa; and those that were settled on the island of Hispan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ola were supplied in the same manner, at the Spanish settlement of Monte-Christo.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion of the ne∣groes in Jamaica.</NOTE> While the British commanders exerted themselves by sea and land, with the most laudable spirit of vigilance and courage, against the foreign adversa∣ries of their country; the colonist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Jamaica ran the most imminent hazard of being extirpated by a domestic enemy. The negro▪slaves of that island,
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> grown insolent in the contemplation of their own formidable numbers, or by observing the supine indolence of their masters, or stimulated by that appetite for liberty so natural to the mind of man, began, in the course of this year, to entertain thoughts of shaking off the yoke by means of a general insurrection. Assemblies were held, and plans revolved for this purpose. At length they concerted a scheme for rising in arms all at once in different parts of the island, in order to massacre all the white men, and take possession of the go∣vernment. They agreed that this design should be put in execution immediately after the depar∣ture of the fleet for Europe: but their plan was defeated by their ignorance and impatience. Those of the conspirators that belonged to captain For∣rest's estate, being impelled by the fumes of in∣toxication, fell suddenly upon the overseer while he sat at supper with some friends, and butchered the whole company. Being immediately joined by some of their confederates, they attacked the neighbouring plantations, where they repeated the same barbarities, and seizing all the arms and ammunition that fell in their way, began to grow formidable to the colony. The governor no sooner received intimation of this disturbance, than he, by proclamation, subjected the colonists to martial law. All other business was interrupted, and every man took to his arms. The regular troops, joined by the troop of militia and a con∣siderable number of volunteers, marched from Spanish Town to St. Mary's, where the insurrec∣tion began, and skirmished with the insurgents; but as they declined standing any regular engage∣ment,
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
and trusted chiefly to bush-fighting, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> governor employed against them the free blacks, commonly known by the name of the Wild Ne∣groes, now peaceably settled under the protection of the government. These auxiliaries, in conside∣ration of a price set upon the heads of the rebels, attacked them in their own way, slew them by surprize, until their strength was broken, and numbers made away with themselves in despair; so that the insurrection was supposed to be quelled about the beginning of May: but in June it broke out again with redoubled fury, and the rebels were reinforced to a very considerable number. The regular troops and the militia, joined by a body of sailors, formed a camp under the command of colonel Spragge, who sent out detachments against the negroes, a good number of whom were killed and some taken; but the rest, instead of submit∣ting, took shelter in the woods and mountains. The prisoners being tried, and found guilty of rebellion, were put to death by a variety of tor∣tures. Some were hanged; some beheaded; some burned; and some fixed alive upon gibbets. One of these last lived eight days and eighteen hours, suspended under a vertical sun, without being re∣freshed by one drop of water, or receiving any manner of sustenance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regula∣tions in that island.</NOTE> In order to prevent such insurrections for the future, the justices assembled at the sessions of the peace, established regulations importing, that no negro-slave should be allowed to quit his planta∣tion without a white conductor, or a ticket of leave; that every negro playing at any sort of game should be scourged through the public
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> streets; that every publican suffering such gaming in his house should forfeit forty shillings; that every proprietor suffering his negroes to beat a drum, blow a horn, or make any other noise in his plantation, should be fined in ten pounds; and every overseer allowing these irregularities, should pay half that sum, to be demanded, or distrained for, by any civil or military officer; that every free negro, or mulatto, should wear a blue cross on his right shoulder, on pain of imprisonment; that no mulatto, Indian, or negro, should hawk or sell any thing, except fresh fish and milk, on pain of being scourged; that rum and punch houses should be shut up during divine service on Sundays, under the penalty of twenty shillings; and that those who had petit licences should shut up their houses on other nights at nine o'clock. Notwith∣standing these examples and regulations, a body of rebellious negroes still subsisted in places that were deemed inaccessible to regular forces, and from these they made nocturnal irruptions into the nearest plantations, where they acted with all the wantonness of barbarity; so that the people of Jamaica were obliged to conduct themselves with the utmost vigilance and circumspection; while rear-admiral Holmes, who commanded at sea, took every precaution to secure the island from in∣sult or invasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Action at sea off H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ola.</NOTE> He not only took measures for the defence of Ja∣maica, but also contrived and executed schemes for annoying the enemy. Having, in the month of October, received intelligence that five French frigates were equipped at Cape Francois on the island of Hispaniola, in order to convoy a fleet of
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
merchant-ships to Europe, he stationed the ships<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> under his command, in such a manner as was most likely to intercept this fleet; and his disposition was attended with success. The enemy sailed from the cape to the number of eight sail on the sixteenth, and next day they were chaced by the king's ships, the Hampshire, Lively, and Boreas, which, how∣ever, made little progress, as there was little wind, and that variable. In the evening, the breeze fresh∣ened, and about midnight the Boreas came up with the Sirenne, commanded by commodore Mac-Cartie. They engaged with great vivacity for about twenty-five minutes, when the Sirenne shot a-head, and made the best of her way. The Bo∣reas was so damaged in the rigging, that she could not close with the enemy again till next day at two in the afternoon, when the action was renewed off the east end of Cuba, and maintained till forty minutes past four, when Mr. Mac Cartie struck. In the mean time, the Hampshire and Lively gave chace to the other four French frigates, which steered to the southward with all the sail they could carry, in order to reach the west-end of Tortuga, and shelter themselves in Port au Prince. On the eighteenth the Lively, by the help of her oars, came up with the Valeur at half an hour past seven in the morning; and after a hot action that con∣tinued an hour and a half, compelled the enemy to submit. The Hampshire stood after the other three, and, about four in the afternoon, ran up be∣tween the duke de Choiseuil and the prince Ed∣ward. These he engaged at the same time; but the first, having the advantage of the wind, made her retreat into Port au Paix: the other ran a-shore about two leagues to leeward, and struck her co∣lours;
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> but, at the approach of the Hampshire; the enemy set her on fire, and she blew up. This was also the fate of the Fleur de Lis, which had run into Fresh water-bay, a▪little farther to lee∣ward of Port au Prince. Thus, by the prudent disposition of admiral Holmes, and the gallantry of his three captains, Norbury, Uvedale, and Maitland, two large frigates of the enemy were taken, and three destroyed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exploit of two lieu∣tenants in the navy.</NOTE> The spirit of the officers was happily supported by an uncommon exertion of courage in the men, who chearfully engaged in the most dangerous en∣terprizes. Immediately after the capture of the French frigates, eight of the enemy's privateers were destroyed or brought into Jamaica. Two of these, namely the Vainqueur of ten guns, sixteen swivels, and ninety men, and the Mackau of six swivels and fifteen men, had run into shoal-water in Cumberland harbour, on the island of Cuba. The boats of the Trent and Boreas were manned, under the direction of the lieutenants, Millar and Stuart, who being rowed up to the Vainqueur, boarded and took possession under a close fire, after having surmounted many other difficulties. The Mackau was taken, without any resistance; then the boats proceeded against the Guespe of eight guns and eighty-five men, which lay at anchor far∣ther up in the Lagoon; but before they came up, the enemy had set her on fire, and she was destroyed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallant behaviour of the captains Obrien and Tay∣lor in the Leeward Islands.</NOTE> The same activity and resolution distinguished the captains and officers belonging to the squadron commanded by Sir James Douglas off the Lee∣ward islands. In the month of September, the captains Obrien and Taylor, of the ships Temple and Griffin, being on a joint cruise off the islands
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
Granadas, received intelligence that the Virgin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760</NOTE> formerly a British sloop of war, which had been taken by the enemy, then lay at anchor, together with three privateers, under protection of three forts on the island, sailed thither in order to attack them; and their enterprize was crowned with suc∣cess. After a warm engagement, that lasted se∣veral hours, the enemy's batteries were silenced, and indeed demolished, and the English captains took possession of the four prizes. They after∣wards entered another harbour of that island, hav∣ing first demolished another fort; and there they lay four days unmolested, at the expiration of which they carried off three other prizes. In their return to Antigua, they fell in with thirteen ships bound to Martinique with provisions, and took them all without resistance. About the same time, eight or nine privateers were taken by the ships which commodore Sir James Douglas employed in cruising round the island of Guadaloupe; so that the British commerce in those seas flourished under his care and protection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trans∣actions in the East-Indies.</NOTE> In the East Indies, the British arms still conti∣nued to prosper. After the reduction of Arcot, the garrisons of Permacoil and Allumparva surren∣dered themselves prisoners of war in the beginning of May. The Falmouth obliged the Haarlem, a French ship from Merguy, to run ashore to the northward of Pondicherry. The important settle∣ment of Carical was reduced by the sea and land forces commanded by rear-admiral Cornish and ma∣jor Monson, and the French garrison made priso∣ners of war; and colonel Coote formed the block∣ade of Pondicherry by land, while the harbour was beset by the English squadron.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> No action of importance was in the course of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little at∣chieve∣ments in the bay of of Qui∣beron.</NOTE> this year atchieved by the naval forces of Great-Britain in the seas of Europe. A powerful squa∣dron still remained in the bay of Quiberon, in order to amuse and employ a body of French forces on that part of the coast, and interrupt the navi∣gation of the enemy; though the principal ai m of this armament seems to have been to watch and detain the few French ships, which had run into the river Villaine, after the defeat of Conflans; an object the importance of which will doubtless astonish posterity. The fleet employed on this ser∣vice was alternately commanded by admiral Bos∣cawen and Sir Edward Hawke, officers of distin∣guished abilities, whose talents might have been surely rendered subservient to much greater na∣tional advantages. All that Mr. Boscawen could do in this circumscribed scene of action was to take possession of a small island near the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver Vannes, which he caused to be cultivated and planted with vegetables for the use of the men infected with scorbutic disorders arising from salt provision, sea air, and want of proper exercise. In the month of September, Sir Edward Hawke, who had by this time relieved Mr. Boscawen, detached the gallant lord Howe in the Magnanime, with the ships prince Frederick and Bedford, to reduce the little island of Dumet, about three miles in length and two in breadth, abounding with fresh water. It was defended by a small fort mounted with nine cannon, and manned with one company of the re∣giment of Bourbon, who surrendered in a very short time after the ships had begun the attack. By this small conquest a considerable expence was
<PB N="15" REF="120"/>
saved to the nation in the article of transports em▪ployed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> to carry water for the use of the squadron.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral Rodney destroys some ves∣sels on the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast of France.</NOTE> Admiral Rodney still maintained his former sta∣tion off the coast of Havre de Grace, to observe what should pass at the mouth of the Seine. In the month of July, while he hovered in this neigh∣bourhood, five large flat-botton<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed boats loaded wth cannon and shot, set sail from Harfleur in the middle of the day, with their colours flying, as if they had set the English squadron at defiance; for the walls of Havre de Grace, and even the adja∣cent hills were covered with spectators, assembled to behold the issue of this adventure. Having reached the river of Caen, they stood backwards and forwards upon the shoals, intending to amuse Mr. Rodney till night, and then proceed under cover of the darkness. He perceived their drift, and gave directions to his small vessels to be ready, that as soon as day-light failed, they should make all the sail they could for the mouth of the river Orne, in order to cut off the enemy's retreat, while he himself stood with the larger ships to the steep coast of Port Bassin. The scheme succeeded to his wish. The enemy, seeing their retreat cut off, ran ashore at Port Passin, where the admiral destroyed them, together with the small fort which had been erected for the defence of this harbour. Each of those vessels was one hundred feet in length, capable of containing four hundred men for a short passage. What their destination was, we cannot pretend to determine: but the French had provided a great number of these transports; for ten escaped into the river Orne leading to Caen; and in consequence of this disaster one hundred
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> were unloaded and sent up again to Rouen. This was not all the damage that the enemy sustained on this part of the coast. In the month of No∣vember, captain Oury of the Acteon chaced a large privateer, and drove her on shore between Cape Barfleur and La Hogue, where she perished. The cutters belonging to Mr. Rodney's squadron scoured the coast towards Dieppe, where a conside∣rable fishery was carried on, and where they took or destroyed near forty vessels of considerable bur∣then. Though the English navy suffered nothing from the French during this period, it sustained some damage from the weather. The Conqueror, a newship of the line, was lost in the channel on the island of St. Nicholas; but the crew and cannon were saved. The Lyme of twenty-guns foundered in the Cattegate in Norway, and fifty of the men perished; and, in the West Indies, a tender belong∣ing to the Dublin, commanded by commodore Sir James Douglas, was lost in a gale of wind, with an hundred chosen mariners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions for a secret expedi∣tion.</NOTE> Of the domestic transactions relating to the war, the most considerable was the equipment of a pow∣erful armament destined for some secret expedition. A numerous body of forces was assembled, and a great number of transports collected at Ports∣mouth. Generals were nominated to the com∣mand of this enterprize. The troops were actu∣ally embarked with a great train of artillery; and the eyes of the whole nation were attentively fixed upon this armament, which could not have been prepared without incurring a prodigious expence. Notwithstanding these preparations, the whole summer was spent in idleness and inaction; and in
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
the latter end of the season the undertaking was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> laid aside. The people did not fail to clamour against the inactivity of the summer, and com∣plain, that notwithstanding the immense subsidies granted for the prosecution of the war, no stroke of importance was struck in Europe for the advan∣tage of Great Britain; but that her treasure was lavished upon fruitless parade, or a G—n alliance still more pernicious. It must be owned, indeed, that no new attempt was made to annoy the enemy on British principles; for the surrender of Mont∣real was the natural consequence of the steps which had been taken, and of the measures concerted in the course of the preceding year. It will be al∣lowed, we apprehend, that the expence incurred by the armament at Portsmouth, and the body of troops there detained, would have been sufficient, if properly applied, to reduce the island of Mau∣ritius on the coast of Africa, Martinique in the West-Indies, or Minorca in the Mediterranean, and all these three were objects of importance. But, in all probability, the design of the armament was either to intimidate the French into proposals of peace, to make a diversion from the Rhine by alarming the coast of Bretagne, or to throw over a body of troops into Flanders to effect a junction with the hereditary prince of Brunswic, who, at the head of twenty thousand men, had made an ir∣ruption as far as the Lower Rhine, and even cros∣sed that river; but he miscarried in the execution of his design.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Astrono∣mers sent to the East-In∣dies.</NOTE> In the midst of these alarms, some regard was payed to the improvements of natural knowledge. The Royal Society having made application to the

Accordingly Mr. Nevil Maskelyne, and Mr. Robert Waddington were appointed to make the observations at St. Helena; and Mr. Charles Mason and Mr. Jeremiah Dixon undertook the voyage to Bencoolen on the island of Sumatra <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of April, the king granted to l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s grandson prince Edward Augustus, and to the heirs male of his royal highness, the dignities of duke of the kingdom of Great Britain, and of earl of the kingdom of Ireland, by the names, stiles, and titles of duke of York and Albany, and of earl of Ulster.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able story of miss Bell.</NOTE> The incredible drains occasioned by the war, pro∣duced so little effect in lowering the spirits of the people and diminishing the appearance of national wealth, that scarce any thing was seen but uninter∣rupted scenes of gaiety and diversion through the whole kingdom. Nay, luxury seemed to advance with more gigantic strides, and every part of the metropolis resounded with mirth and minstrel∣sy, riot and extravagance. In the month of Octo∣ber the attention of the public was engaged by some interesting circumstances that attended the death of one miss Bell, an unfortunate young creature of a good family, who had renounced her father's house,
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
and▪ embraced the wretched life of a common pro∣stitute.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> She died at a lodging house in Marybone, having declared on her death-bed, to an officer of her acquaintance, who visited her from a mo∣tive of humanity, that she had received her death's wound at a bagnio from a certain young gentle∣man, who seemed to have mangled her out of meer wantonness of brutality. She not only per∣sisted in repeating this declaration before divers persons; but conjured the officer to see justice done upon the the villain, who treated her so inhu∣manly. Her complaint was corroborated by the asseveration of her own maid and attendant, who bore witness to her being wounded in two diffe∣rent places. These circumstances made such an impression upon the gentleman, that he applied to a justice of the peace, and obtained an order for taking up her body after she was buried, that it might be subjected to the cognizance of the coroner and his inquest; it accordingly underwent an examination, and was re-interred, after the jury had given their verdict, that she died of a natural death. The officer, who, though in attendance, had not been examined, was not satisfied with this decision, and resolved to promote a further en∣quiry: he wrote to the young woman's father, as well as to the person accused, who had retired to the country, and declared, that he would sub∣mit himself to a fair trial, that his character might be vindicated to the satisfaction of the public; accordingly, when the father commenced a pro∣secution, he surrendered himself before five jus∣tices of the peace in Westminster, who, having examined a great number of witnesses, were of
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> opinion, that the warrant should be discharged. As a pamphlet, containing an account of the death of miss Bell, had been published, and without doubt given a bad impression of this gentleman, he prosecuted the officer in the King's Bench for having published a libel against him; but the in∣formation was set aside, and the judge ordered the prosecutor to be tried at the Old Baily for murder. He was brought to the bar of that tribunal, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">1761.</NOTE> the month of February, and, after a long hearing, acquitted. By part of the evidence it appeared, there was reason to believe the unfortunate de∣ceased was actually delirious, when she made the complaint to the officer: the nurse contradicted the evidence of that gentleman: the servants of the bagnio declared, that no wounds had been given at the time when the tragedy was supposed to be acted: the apothecary, who attended her in her last moments, affirmed that the wounds could not be the cause of her death, but actually preserved her from dying of a mortification; and the phy∣sician gave it as his opinion, that the supposed wounds were no other than abscesses, formed by an effort of nature to relieve itself. Had they really been wounds, there would be little reason to suppose they were the immediate cause of her death, as no considerable vessel had been hurt, nor any of the bowels injured; but, that the in∣fliction of such wounds, co-operating with other circumstances of barbarity, blows, stripes, and bruises, might, in a body incensed with rage, and inflamed with intoxication, produce a fever, that would terminate in death, is a possibility to which every judicious physician must subscribe;
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
and, in that case, he, who inflicted the wounds and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> bruises, who aroused the resentment, and promoted the intoxication, of the deceased, cannot justly be pronounced innocent of her death. The person, however, accused of miss Bell's murder was ac∣quitted on the fullest evidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth∣quakes in Syria.</NOTE> Except the countries that were actually the scenes of war, no political revolution or distur∣bance disquieted the general tranquillity. Syria, indeed, felt all the horrors and wreck of a dread∣ful earthquake, protracted in repeated shocks, which began on the thirtieth day of October, in the neighbourhood of Tripoli. A great number of houses were overthrown at Seyde, and many people buried under the ruins. It was felt through a space of ten thousand square leagues, compre∣hending the mountains of Libanus, and Antili∣banus, with an infinite number of villages, that were reduced to heaps of rubbish. At Acra, or Ptolemais, the sea overwhelmed its banks, and poured into the streets; though eight feet above the level of the water. The city of Saphet was intirely destroyed, and the greatest part of its in∣habitants perished. At Damascus all the minorets were overthrown, and six thousand people lost their lives. The shocks diminished gradually till the twenty-fifth day of November, when they were renewed with redoubled havock; the earth trembled with the most dreadful convulsions, and the greater part of Tripoli was destroyed. Balbeo was entirely ruined, and this was the fate of many other towns and castles; so that the people, who escaped the ruins, were obliged to sojourn in the open fields, and all Syria was threatened with the
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> vengeance of heaven. Such a dangerous fer∣ment arose at Constantinople, that a revolution was apprehended. Mustapha, the present emperor, had no sons; but his brother Bajazet, whose life he had spared, contrary to the maxims of Turkish policy, produced a son by one of the women, with whom he was indulged in his confinement; a circumstance which aroused the jealousy of the emperor to such a degree, that he resolved to dis∣patch his brother. The great officers of the Porte opposed this design, which was so disagreeable to the people, that an insurrection ensued. Several Turks and Armenians, taking it for granted that a revolution was at hand, bought up great quan∣tities of grain; and a dreadful dearth was the consequence of this monopoly. The Sultan as∣sembled the troops, quieted the insurgents, or∣dered the engrossers of corn to be executed, and in a little time, the repose of the city was re∣established.</P>

The king of Spain, howsoever sollicited by the other branch of the house of Bourbon, to engage in the war, as its ally, refused to interpose in any other way, than as a mediator between the courts of London and Versailles. He sent the Conde de Fuentes, a nobleman of high rank and character, in quality of ambassador extraordinary to the king of Great Britain, in order to offer his good offices for effecting a peace; and the Conde, after having conferred with the English ministry, made an ex∣cursion to Paris; but his proposal with respect to

Other differences subsisting between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain, he found no difficulty in compromising. His Catholic ma∣jesty persisted in the execution of a plan truly worthy of a patriot king. In the first place, he spared no pains and application to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the state of his king∣dom. He remitted to his people all they owed the crown, amounting to threescore millions of reals: he demanded an exact account of his father's debts, that they might be discharged with the utmost punctuality: an order was sent to the treasury, that ten millions of reals should be annually ap∣propriated for this purpose, until the whole should be liquidated; and, to the first year's payment, he added fifty millions, to be divided equally among the legal claimants. He took measures for the vigorous execution of the laws against offenders; encouraged industry; protected commerce; and felt the exquisite pleasure of being beloved as the father of his people. To give importance to his crown, and extend his influence among the powers of Europe, he equipped a powerful squadron of ships at Carthagena, and is said to have declared his intention to employ them against Algiers, should the Dey refuse to release the slaves of the Spanish nation.</P>

In the mean time, another embarkation of Jesuits was sent from Lisbon to Civita Vecchia; yet the ex∣pulsion of these fathers did not restore the inter∣nal peace of Portugal, or put at end to the prac∣tice of plotting: for, even since their departure, some persons of rank have been either committed to close prison, or exiled from the kingdom. The Jesuits were not more fortunate in America; for in the month of October, in the foregoing year, an obstinate battle was fought between the united forces of Spain and Portugal, and the In∣dians of Paraguay, who were under the domi∣nion of the Jesuits: victory at length declared in favour of the two crowns: so that the vanquished were obliged to capitulate, and lay down their arms. As the court of Portugal had made re∣monstrances to the British ministry against the proceedings of the English squadron under admiral Boscawen, which had attacked and destroyed some French ships under the Portuguese fort in the bay of Lagos, his Britannic majesty thought proper to send the earl of Kinnoul, as ambassador ex∣traordinary, to Lisbon, where that nobleman made such excuses for the insult of the English admiral, as entirely removed all misunderstanding between the two crowns; and could not fail of being agreeable to the Portuguese monarch, thus re∣spected, soothed, and deprecated by a mighty na∣tion in the very zenith of power and prosperity. On the sixth of June, being the birth-day of the king of Portugal, the marriage of his brother, Don Pedro, with the princess of Brazil, was celebrated

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tur∣kish ship of the line car∣ried into Malta.</NOTE> An incident, which happened in the Mediterra∣nean, had like to have drawn the indignation of the Ottoman Porte on the knights of the order of Malta. A large Turkish ship of the line, mount∣ed with sixty-eight brass cannon, having on board a complement of seven hundred men, besides seventy Christian slaves, under the immediate command of the Turkish admiral, had, in com∣pany with two frigates, five gallies, and other smaller vessels, sailed in June from the Dardanells, cruised along the coasts of Smyrna, Scio, and Trio, and at length anchored in the channel of Stangie, where the admiral with four hundred persons went on shore, on the nineteenth day of September: the Christian slaves, seizing this op∣portunity, armed themselves with knives, and fell upon the three hundred that remained with such fury and effect, that a great number of the Turks were instantly slain: many leaped overboard into the sea, where they perished; and the rest sued for mercy. The Christians, having thus secured possession of the ship, hoisted sail, and bore away for Malta; which, though chaced by the two frigates, and a Ragusan ship, they reached by crouding all their canvas; and brought their prize safe into the harbour of Volette, amidst the ac∣clamations of the people.

He employed men of ability, at his own expence, to travel into foreign countries, and collect the most curious productions for the advancement of natural histo∣ry: he encouraged the liberal and mechanic arts at home, by munificent rewards and peculiar protection: he invited above a thousand foreigners from Germany to become his subjects, and settle in certain districts of Jutland, which had lain waste above three centuries; and they forthwith began to build villages, and cultivate the lands, in the dioceses of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bourg, Arhous, and Ripen: their travelling expences from Altena to their new settlement were defrayed by the king, who, moreover, maintained them until the produce of

He observed, that the king his sovereign was deeply affected by these outra∣geous doings, and mischievous designs of the Dutch in the East Indies, whose aim was to des∣troy the British settlements in that country; an aim that would have been accomplished, had not the king's victorious arms brought them to rea∣son, and obliged them to sue for an accommoda∣tion. He told them his majesty would willingly believe their High Mightinesses had given no order for proceeding to such extremities, and that the directors of their India company had no share in the transaction: nevertheless he (the ambassador) was ordered to demand signal satisfaction, in the name of the king his master; that all who should be found to have shared in the offence so mani∣festly tending to the destruction of the English settlements in that country, should be exemplarily punished; and that their High Mightinesses should confirm the stipulations agreed upon, immediate∣ly after the action, by the directors of the respec∣tive companies; in consideration of which agree∣ment, the Dutch ships were restored, after their commanders acknowledged their fault, in owning themselves the aggressors.

Her allies however seemed less actuated by the spirit of revenge. The French king had sustained so much damage and disgrace in the course of the war, that his resources failed, and his finances fell into disorder; he could no longer afford the subsidies he had promised to different powers; while his subjects clamoured aloud at the burden of impositions, the ruin of trade, and the repeated dishonour intailed upon the arms of France. The czarina's zeal for the alliance was evidently cooled by the irregular and defective payments of the sub∣sidies she had stipulated. Perhaps she was disap∣pointed in her hope of conquest, and chagrined to see her armies retire from Germany at the approach of every winter; and the British ministry did not fail to exert all their influence to detach her from the confederacy in which she had embarked.

The king of Great Britain, by the mouth of his ambassador, thanked their High Mightinesses for the sincere desire they ex∣pressed to put an end to the ravages of war, which had extended desolation over the face of Europe: he readily closed with their gracious offer, and in consequence of his high regard and invariable friendship for their High Mightinesses, wished ear∣nestly that it might be acceptable to the other powers at war. The French king expressed his sentiments nearly to the same purpose. His am∣bassador declared, That his most Christian▪majesty was highly sensible of the offer they had made of Breda for holding the congress; that, in order to give a fresh proof of his sincere desire to encrease the good harmony that subsisted between him and the States-General, he accepted their offer with pleasure; but as he could take no step without the concurrence of his high allies, he was obliged to wait for their answer, which could not fail to be fa∣vourable, if nothing remained to be settled but the place for holding the congress.

As he could not pretend to undertake the siege of the fortress, by the fire of which he was exceedingly galled, he demanded of the town a contribution of one hundred thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rins; and carried some of the magistrates along with him as hostages for the payment of this imposition.

On pretence of taking umbrage at the town of Hanau-Muntzenberg, for having, without their permission, acknowledged the regency of the landgravate of Hesse-Cassel, they, in the month of February, ordered the magi∣gistrates of that place to pay, within the term of twenty-four hours, the sum of seven hundred and fifty thousand livres, on pain of being subjected to plunder. This order was signified by the prince de Robecq; to whom the magistrates represented the impossibility of raising such a sum, as the coun∣try was totally exhausted, and their credit abso∣lutely destroyed, in consequence of their inability to pay the interest of the capitals negotiated in the course of the preceding year. He still insisting upon their finding the money before night, they offered to pay eighty thousand florins, which they raised with the utmost difficulty, and begged the payment of the rest might be postponed for a few weeks; but their request was rejected with dis∣dain. The garrison was reinforced by two batta∣lions, and four squadrons disper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the princi∣pal squares and markets in the city, and the gates were shut.

From hence the French marched, in their turn, to plunder the towns of Hirchfeldt and Vacha. Accordingly they appeared at Vacha, situated on the frontiers of Hesse, and forming the head of the chain of cantonments which the allies had on the Werra. This place was attacked with such vigour, that co∣lonel Freytag, who commanded the post, was obliged to abandon the town; but he maintained himself on a rising-ground in the neighbourhood, where he amused the enemy, until two battalions of grenadiers came to his assistance. Thus rein∣forced, he pursued the French for three leagues, and drove them with a considerable loss from Gissa, where they had resolved to fix their quarters.

While his quarters were established at Frankfort, his troops were plenti∣fully supplied with all sorts of provision from the Upper Rhine; but this convenience depended upon his being master of the course of the river: but he could not move from this position without forfeiting the advantage, and providing magazines for the use of his forces, so that he was obliged to lie inactive until he could have the benefit of green forage in his march.</P>

The former of these having ordered colonel Luckner to scour the coun∣try with a body of hussars, that officer, on the twenty-fourth day of May, fell in with a French patrole, which gave the alarm at Butzbach, when the garrison of that place, amounting to five hun∣dred picquets, under general Waldener, fled with great precipitatinn. Being, however, pursued and overtaken near a wood, they were routed and dis∣persed. Colonel Luckner, entering Butzbach, found a considerable quantity of forage, flour, wine, and equipage, belonging to the fugitives. What he could not carry off, he distributed among the poor inhabitants, and returned to general Im∣hoff's camp at Ameneburg, with above an hundred prisoners. This excursion alarmed the enemy to such a degree, that their whole army was put in motion; and the duke de Broglio, in person, ad∣vanced with a large body of troops as far as Freid∣berg: but understanding the allies had not quitted their camp at Fritzlar, he returned to Frankfort,

This alarm was not so mortifying as the secession of the Wirtemberg troops, amounting to ten thousand men, commanded by their duke in person, who left the French army in disgust, and returned to his own country. The Imperial army, under the prince de Deuxponts, quartered at Bam∣berg, began their march to Naumberg on the twentieth of May; but one of their detachments of cavalry having received a check from a body of Prussians near Lutzen, they fell back; and on the fourth day of June encamped at Lichtenfels upon the Maine. The small detachments of the grand armies, as well as those belonging to the bodies commanded by general Sporcken and the count de St. Germain in the neighbourhood of Dusseldorp, skirmished with various success. The hereditary prince of Brunswic being detached from the al∣lied army, with some battalions of grenadiers and two regiments of English dragoons, advanced to the county of Fulda, where he was joined by the troops under general Gilsoe, and atchieved some inconsiderable exploits, particularly at Hosenfeldt and Zielbach, where he surprised and took divers parties of the enemy.</P>

In the mean time, the duke de Broglio, assembling his forces between Merlau

His intention was to penetrate through the country of Hesse into Hanover, and make himself intirely master of that electorate. With this view he resolved to effect a junction with the count de St. Germain, whom he directed to ad∣vance towards Brilau and Corbach; while he him∣self, decamping from Neustadt on the eighth day of July, advanced by the way of Frankenberg.

The hereditary prince, continuing to advance, found the enemy already formed at Corbach; but judging their whole force did not exceed ten thousand infantry and seventeen squadrons, and being impelled by the impetuosity of his own courage, he resolved to give them battle. He accordingly attacked them about two in the afternoon, and the action became very warm and obstinate: but the enemy being conti∣nually reinforced with fresh battalions, and having the advantage of a numerous artillery, all the prince's efforts were ineffectual. Prince Ferdi∣nand, being at too great a distance to sustain him,

sent him an order to rejoin the army, which was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> by this time formed at Saxenhausen. He forth∣with made dispositions for a retreat, which however was attended with great confusion. The enemy, observing the disorder of the allied troops, plied their artillery with redoubled diligence; while a powerful body of their cavalry charged with great vivacity. In all likelihood the whole infantry of the allies would have been cut off, had not the he∣reditary prince made a diversion in their favour, by charging in person at the head of the British dra∣goons, who acted with their usual gallantry and effect. This respite enabled the infantry to ac∣complish their retreat to Saxenhausen; but they lost above five hundred men, and fifteen pieces of cannon. General count Kielmansegg, major-ge∣neral Griffin, and major Hill of Bland's dragoons, distinguished themselves by their conduct and in∣trepidity on this occasion. The hereditary prince exposed his life in the hottest part of the action▪ and received a slight wound in the shoulder, which gave him far less disturbance than he felt from the chagrin and mortification produced by his defeat.</P>

Prince Ferdinand, receiving advice that a body of the enemy, commanded by major-general Glau∣bitz, had advanced on the left of the allies to Zie∣genheim, detached the hereditary prince to op∣pose them, at the head of six battalions of Hano∣verians and Hessians, with Elliot's regiment of English light horse, Luckner's hussars, and two brigades of chasseurs; on the sixteenth day of the

At length victo∣ry declared for the allies. Five battalions of the enemy, including the commander in chief, and the prince of Anhalt-cothen, were taken, with six pieces of cannon, all their arms, baggage, and artillery. During these transactions, the mare∣chal duke de Broglio remained encamped on the heights of Corbach. He had, in advancing from Franckfort, left detachments to reduce the castles of Marpurg and Dillemburg, which were occu∣pied by the allies, and they fell into his hands, the garrisons of both being obliged to surrender priso∣ners of war. These were but inconsiderable con∣quests; nor did the progress of the French gene∣ral equal the idea which had been formed of his talents and activity. The count de St. Germain, who was his senior officer, and believed by many to be at least his equal in capacity, having now joined his corps to the grand army, and conceiving disgust at his being obliged to serve under the duke de Broglio, relinquished his command, in which he was succeeded by the chevalier de Muy. At the same time, the marquis de Voyer, and the count de Luc, two generals of experience

The hereditary prince, who had the preceding day passed the same river, in order to reinforce general Sporcken, who was posted near Corbeke, now re∣connoitred the position of the enemy, and found them possessed of a very advantageous camp be∣tween Warbourg and Ochsendorff. Prince Ferdi∣nand, having resolved to attack them, ordered the hereditary prince and Mr. Sporcken to turn their left, while he himself advanced against their front, with the main body of the army. The enemy was accordingly attacked, almost at the same instant, both in flank and in rear, with equal impetuosity and success. As the infantry of the

The battalion of Maxwell, and a brigade under colonel Beckwith, composed of grenadiers and Highlanders, distinguished themselves remarkably on this occasion. The ene∣my left about fifteen hundred men, killed or wounded, on the field of battle; with some co∣lours, and ten pieces of cannon, and about the same number were made prisoners. Monsieur de Muy lay all night under arms, on the heights of Volk-Missen, from whence he next day retired towards Wolfshagen.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is with the greatest sa∣tisfaction, that I have the ho∣nour of acquainting your lordship of the success of the hereditary prince, yesterday morning.</P>
<P>General Sporcken's corps marched from the camp at Kalle to Liebenau, about four in the afternoon of the twenty-ninth; the heredi∣tary prince followed the same evening, with a body of troops, among which were the two English batralions of grenadiers, the two of High∣landers, and four squadrons of dragoons, Cope's and Con∣way's.</P>
<P>The army was under arms all day on the thirtieth, and, about eleven at night, march∣ed off in six columns to Lie∣benau. About five the next morning, the whole army assembled, and formed on the heights near Corbeke. The hereditary prince was, at this time, marching in two co∣lumns, in order to turn the enemy's left flank; which he did by marching to Donhel∣bourg, leaving Klein-Eder on his left, and forming in two lines, with his left towards Dossel, and his right near Grimbeck, opposite to the left flank of the enemy, whose position was, with the left to the high hill near Offendorff, and their right to Warbourg, into which place they had flung Fischer's corps. The hereditary prince immediate∣ly attacked the enemy's flank, and, after a very sharp dis∣pute, obliged them to give way, and, by a continual fire, kept forcing them to fell back upon Warbourg. The army was, at this time, marching with the greatest diligence to attack the enemy in front; but the infantry could not get up in time: general Waldegrave, at the head of the British, pressed their march as much as possible: no troops could shew more eagerness to get up, than they shewed. Many of the men, from the heat of the weather, and over-straining themselves to get on, through morassy and very difficult ground, suddenly dropped down on their march.</P>
<P>General Mosty, who was at the head of the British ca∣valry, formed on the right of our infantry on the other side of a large wood, upon receiv∣ing the duke's orders to come up with the cavalry as fast as possible, made so much expe∣dition, bringing them up at a full trot, though the dis∣tance was near five miles, that the British cavalry had the happiness to arrive in time, to share the glory of the day, having successfully <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harged, several times, both the enemy's cavalry and in∣fantry.</P>
<P>I should do injustice to the general officers, to every offi∣cer and private man, of the cavalry, if I did not beg your lordship would assure his ma∣jesty, that nothing could ex∣ceed their gallant behaviour on that occasion.</P>
<P>Captain Philips made so much expedition with his cannon, as to have an op∣portunity, by a severe ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nonade, to oblige those who had passed the Dymel, and were formed on the other side, to retire with the utmost precipitation.</P>

<P>M. de Muy is now retiring from the heights of Volk∣missen, where he lay under arms last night, towards Wolf∣shagen. I cannot give your lordship an account of the loss on either side.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> By this success, prince Ferdinand was enabled to maintain his communication with Westphalia; and keep the enemy at a distance from the heart of Hanover; but to these objects he sacrificed the country of Cassel: for, prince Xavier of Saxony, at the head of a detached body, much more numerous than that which was left under general Kielmansegge, advanced towards Cassel,
<PB N="47" REF="470"/>
and made himself master of that city; then he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> reduced Munden, Gottingen, and Elmbeck, in the electorate of Hanover. All that prince Fer∣dinand could do, considering how much he was out-numbered by the French, was to secure posts and passes with a view to retard their progress, and employ detachments to harrass and surprise their advanced parties. In a few days after the action at Warbourg, general Luckner repulsed a French detachment, which had advanced as far as Eimbeck, and surprised another at Nordheim. At the same period, colonel Donap with a body of the allied army attacked a French corps of two thousand men, posted in the wood of Saba∣bourg, to preserve the communication between their grand army, and their troops on the other side of the Weser; and, notwithstanding the strength of their situation, drove them from their post, with the loss of five hundred men, either killed or made prisoners; but this advantage was overbalanced by the reduction of Ziegenhain, garrisoned by seven hundred men of the allied army, who, after a vigorous resistance, were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war. On the fifth day of August, prince Ferdinand be∣ing encamped at Buhne, received intelligence that a considerable body of the enemy, amounting to upwards of twenty thousand men, were in motion to make a general forage in the neighbourhood of Geismar. He passed the Dymel early in the morning, with a body of troops, and some artil∣lery, and posted them in such an advantageous manner, as to render the enemy's attempt totally
<PB N="48" REF="480"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> ineffectual, although the foragers were covered with great part of their army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The he∣reditary prince beats up the quar∣ters of the French at Ziren∣berg.</NOTE> On the same morning, the hereditary prince set out on an expedition to beat up the quarters of a French detachment. Being informed that the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphine, to the number of one thousand, horse and foot, were cantoned at Zierenberg, at a small distance from the French camp at Dierenberg, and passed their time in the most careless security, he advanced to∣wards them from his camp at Warbourg, with∣in a league of their cantonment, without seeing any of their posts, or meeting with any of their patroles; a circumstance that encouraged him to beat up their quarters by surprize: for this ser∣vice he pitched upon five battalions, with a de∣tachment of Highlanders, and eight regiments of dragoons. Leaving their tents standing, they be∣gan their march at eight in the evening, and passed the Dymel near Warbourg. About a league on the other side of the Dymel, at the village of Wit∣zen, they were joined by the light troops under ma∣jor Bulow; and now the disposition was made, both for entering the town, and securing a retreat, in case of being repulsed. When they were within two miles of Zierenberg, and in sight of the fires of the enemy's grand guard, the grenadiers of Maxwel, the regiment of Kingsley, and the High∣landers, advanced by three separate roads, and marched in profound silence: at length, the noise of their feet alarmed the French, who began to fire; then the grenadiers proceeded at a round pace with unloaded firelocks, pushed the piquets,
<PB N="49" REF="490"/>
slew the guard at the gate, and rushing into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> town drove every thing before them with incredi∣ble impetuosity. The attack was so sudden, and the surprize so great, that the French had not time to assemble in any considerable number; but they began to fire from the windows, and, in so doing, exasperated the allied troops, who, bursting into the houses, slaughtered them without mercy. Hav∣ing remained in the place from two till three in the morning, they retreated with about four hun∣dred prisoners, including forty officers; and brought off two pieces of artillery. This noctur∣nal adventure, in which the British troops display∣ed equal courage and activity, was atchieved with very little loss; but, after all, it deserves no other appellation, than that of a partizan exploit, for it was attended with no sort of advantage to the al∣lied army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petty ad∣vantages on both sides.</NOTE> Considering the great superiority of the French army, we cannot account for the little progress made by the duke de Broglio, who, according to our conception, might either have given battle to the allies with the utmost probability of success; or penetrated into the heart of Hanover, the con∣quest of which seemed to be the principal object of the French ministry. Instead of striking an important stroke, he retired from Immenhausen towards Cassel, where he fortified his camp, as if he had thought himself in danger of being attacked; and the war was carried on by small detachments▪ Major Bulow being sent with a strong party from the camp of the allied army at Bline, surprised the town of Marpurg, destroyed the French ovens, and brought off a considerable quantity of stores

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> and baggage, with some prisoners. He met with the same success at Butzbach, where he surprised and took two companies belonging to the regi∣giment of Raugrave, and retired with his body to Frankenberg, where he joined colonel Forsen. On the twelfth day of September they made a move∣ment towards Frankenau; and Mr. de Stainville, who was posted with a body of French troops at Merdenhagen, advanced to check their progress. He came up with their rear in the neighbourhood of Munden, and attacked them in passing the river Orck, with such vigour, that Forsen, with some of his cavalry, was taken, and Bulow obliged to abandon some pieces of cannon. The action was just determined, when this last was reinforced by the hereditary prince of Brunswick, who had made a forced march of five German miles, which had fatigued the troops to such a degree, that he de∣ferred his attack till next morning; but, in the mean time, M. de Stainville retired towards Frankenburg. The Hanoverian general Wan∣genheim, at the head of four batta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions and six squadrons, had driven the enemy from the defiles of Soheite, and encamped at Lawenthagen; but, being attacked by a superior number, he was obliged, in his turn, to give way, and his re∣treat was not effected without the loss of two hun∣dred men, and some pieces of artillery. When the enemy retired, general Wangenheim repassed the Weser, and occupied his former situation at Ussar. Mean while, general Luckner gained an advantage over a detachment of French cavalry, near Norten. Prince Ferdinand, when marechal Broglio quitted his camp at Immenhausen, made
<PB N="51" REF="510"/>
a motion of his troops, and established his head-quarters<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> at Geinsmar-wells, the residence of the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel; from thence, however, he transferred them about the latter end of Septem∣ber, to Ovilgune, on the Westphalian side of the Dymel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The he∣reditary prince makes to the Lower Rhine.</NOTE> Such was the position of the two opposite grand armies when the world waa surprised by an expedition to the Lower Rhine, made by the here∣ditary prince of Brunswick. Whether this excur∣sion was intended to hinder the French from rein∣forcing their army in Westphalia, or to co-operate in the Low Countries, with the armament now rea∣dy equipped in the ports of England; or to gra∣tify the ambition of a young prince, overboil∣ing with courage, and glowing with the desire of conquest; we cannot explain to the satisfaction of the reader: certain it is, the Austrian Nether∣lands were, at this juncture, entirely destitute of troops, except the French garrisons of Ostend and Nieuport, which were weak and inconsiderable▪ Had ten thousand English troops been landed on the coast of Blankenburg▪ they might have taken posses∣sion of Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and Antwerp, with∣out resistance, and joined the hereditary prince in the heart of the country: in that case, he would have found himself at the head of thirty thousand men, and might have made such a diversion in favour of Hanover, as to transfer the seat of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Westphalia into Flanders. The empress queen might indeed have complained of this invasion, as the formality of declaring war against her had not been observed by Great Britain; but, considering that she was the declared enemy of Hanover, and
<PB N="52" REF="520"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> had violated the barrier treaty, in establishing which the kingdom of Great Britain had lavished away so much blood and treasure; a step of this kind, we apprehend, might have been taken, with∣out any imputation of perfidy or injustice. What∣ever the motives for the prince's expedition might have been, he certainly quitted the grand army of the allies, in the month of September, and, tra∣versing Westphaiia, with twenty battalions, and as many squadrons, appeared on the Lower Rhine, marching by Schermbeck and Dusseldorp. On the twenty-ninth day of the month, he sent a large detachment over the river at Rocroort, which sur∣prised part of the French partizan Fischer's corps at Rhynberg, and scoured the country. Next day, other parties, crossing at Rees and Emerick, took possession of some redoubts, which the French had raised along the bank of the river; and here they found a number of boats sufficient to transport the rest of the forces. Then the prince advanced to Cleves, and, at his approach, the French garrison, consisting of five hundred men, under the com∣mand of M. de Barrel, retired into the castle, which, however, they did not long defend; for on the third day of October, they capitulated, and sur∣rendered themselves prisoners of war, after having in vain endeavoured to obtain more favourable con∣ditions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He comes to Wesel, and is worsted at Cam∣pen.</NOTE> A more important object was Wesel, which the prince invested, and began to besiege in form. The approaches were made on the right of the Rhine, while the prince in person remained on the left to cover the siege; and kept his communica∣tion open with the other side, by a bridge above,
<PB N="53" REF="530"/>
and another below the place. He had hoped to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> carry it by a vigorous exertion, without the for∣mality of a regular siege, but he met with a warmer reception than he expected; and his ope∣rations were retarded by heavy rains, which, by swelling the river, endangered his bridges, and laid his trenches under water. The difficulties and delays occasioned by this circumstance en∣tirely frustrated his design. The French, being made acquainted with his motions, were not slow in taking measures to anticipate his success. M. de Castries was detached after him, with thirty battalions, and thirty-eight squadrons; and, by forced marches, arrived, on the fourteenth day of October, at Rhynberg, where the prince's light troops were posted. These he attacked imme∣diately, and compelled to abandon the post, not∣withstanding all the efforts of the prince, who commanded in person, and appeared in the warm∣est part of this short but sanguinary affair. The enemy, leaving five battalions, with some squa∣drons, at Rhynberg, marched by the left, and en∣camped behind the convent of Campen. The prince, having received intimation, that M. de Castries was not yet joined by some reinforce∣ments, that were on the march, determined to be beforehand with them, and attempt that very night to surprise him in his camp. For this pur∣pose, he began his march at ten in the evening, after having left four battalions, and five squa∣drons, under general Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, with instructions to observe Rhynberg, and attack that post, in case the attempt on Campen should succeed. Before the allied forces could reach the enemy's camp,
<PB N="$4" REF="540"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> they were under the necessity of overpowering Fischer's corps of irregulars, which occupied the convent of Campen, at the distance of half a league in their front. This service occasioned some firing, the noise of which alarmed the French army. Their commander formed them with great expedition, and posted them in a wood, where they were immediately attacked, and, at first, obliged to give ground; but they soon retrieved all they had lost, and sustained, without flinching, an unceasing fire of musquetry, from five in the morning till nine at night, when they reaped the fruits of their perseverance. The hereditary prince, whose horse was killed under him, seeing no pros∣spect of success in prolonging an action, which had already cost him a considerable number of men, thought proper to give orders for a retreat, which was not effected without consusion, and left the field of battle to the enemy. His loss, on this occasion, did not fall short of sixteen hun∣dred choice men, killed, wounded, and taken; and this loss fell chiefly on the troops of Great-Britain, who were always found in the foremost ranks of danger. All their officers, both of in∣santry and dragoons, distinguished themselves re∣markably, and many were dangerously wounded. Among these, the nation regretted the loss of lord Downe, whose wounds proved mortal: he was a young nobleman of spirit, who had lately em∣braced a military life, though he was not regular∣ly trained in the service.</P>

and extended along the Rhine. The firing of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> cannon and musquetry was maintained till night. Mean while, a column of the French infantry, commanded by M. de Chabot, marched through Walach, and took post among the thickets, at the distance of a quarter of a league, in the front of the prince's army. By this time, the Rhine was so much swelled by the rains, and the banks of it were overflowed in such a manner, that it was necessary to repair and move lower down the bridge, which had been thrown over that ri∣ver. This work was accordingly performed in presence of the enemy, and, the prince, pas∣sing without molestation, proceeded to Bruynen, where he fixed his head-quarters. His passing the Rhine so easily, under the eye of a victorious ar∣my, so much superior to him in number, may be counted among the fortunate incidents of his life. Such was the issue of an expedition, which exposed the projector of it to the imputation of temerity. Whatever his aim might have been, besides the reduction of Wesel, with the strength of which he did not seem to have been very well acquainted, he certainly miscarried in his design, and his miscarriage was attended with a very con∣siderable loss of troops, occasioned not only by the action, but also by the diseases engendered from the wet weather, the fatigue of long marches, and the want of proper conveniencies, not to men∣tion the enormous expence in contingencies, in∣curred by this fruitless undertaking.</P>
<P>In the month of November, while he lay en∣camped in the neighbourhood of Schermbeck, a body of the enemy attempted to beat up his quar∣ters:

He abandoned the tents that were in the front of his camp, and posted his infantry in am∣buscade behind those that were in the rear: at the same time he ordered some regiments of horse and hussars to setch a compass, and fall upon the back of the enemy. The stratagem succeeded to his wish. The French detachment, believing the al∣lies had actually abandoned their camp, began to pillage the tents in the utmost disorder: then the infantry sallied from the place where they were concealed, and fell upon them with great impe∣tuosity: the artillery opened, and the cavalry charged them in flank. In a word of twelve hundred who marched from Wesel on this expe∣dition, scarce two hundred escaped.</P>

He there∣fore contented himself with ravaging the country by detachments: he sent M. de Stainville with a considerable body of forces to penetrate into the heart of Hanover; and on the fifteenth day of September, that officer falling in with a detachment of the allies, commanded by major Bulow, attacked them near the abbey of Schaken. After a warm and obstinate engagement, they were defeated and driven to Bulemont, with the loss of their cannon,

After this exploit, M. de Stainville advanced to Halberstadt, and de∣manded of that capital a contribution of one mil∣lion five hundred thousand livres: but the citizens had been so drained by former exactions, that they could not raise above thirty thousand: for the re∣mainder the French partizan took hostages, with whom he returned to the grand army encamped at Cassel, from whence they, in a little time, fell back as far as Gottingen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The al∣lies and French go into winter-quarters.</NOTE> As the enemy retreated, prince Ferdinand ad∣vanced as far as Hurste, where he established his head-quarters about the latter end of November. While he remained in this position, divers skirmishes happened in the neighbourhood of Gottingen. Major-general Breidenbach, at the head of two regiments of Hanoverian and Brunswick guards, with a detachment of cavalry, attacked on the twenty-ninth day of November, the French post at Heydemunden, upon the river Worrau. This he carried, and took possession of the town, which the enemy hastily abandoned. Part of their de∣tachment crossed the river in boats; the rest threw themselves into an intrenchment that covered the passage, which the allies endeavoured to force in several unsuccessful attempts, galled as they were by the fire of the enemy's redoubts on the other side of the river. At length M. Breidenbach was obliged to desist and fall back into the town, from whence he retired at midnight, after having sus∣tained considerable damage. Prince Ferdinand had it very much at heart to drive the French from

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An▪ 1760.</NOTE> Gottingen, and accordingly invested that city; but the French garrison, which was numerous and well provided, made such a vigorous defence as baffled all the endeavours of the allies, who were moreover impeded by the rainy weather, which, added to other considerations, prevented them from undertaking the siege in form. Nevertheless, they kept the place blocked up from the twenty-second day of November to the twelfth of the following month, when the garrison, in a desperate sally, took one of their principal posts, and com∣pelled them to raise the blockade. About the middle of December, prince Ferdinand retired into winter-quarters, he himself residing at Uslar, and the English troops being cantoned in the bishopric of Paderborn. Thus the enemy were left in pos∣session of Hes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the whole country eastward of the Weser to the frontiers of the electorate of Hanover. If the allied army had not been weak∣ened, for the sake of a rash, ill-concerted, and unsuccessful expedition to the Lower Rhine, in all probability the French would have been obliged to abandon the footing they had gained in the course of this campaign, and in particular to re∣treat from Gottingen, which they now maintained and fortified with great diligence and circum∣spection.</P>

Even the Swedes, who had languished
<PB N="59" REF="600"/>
so long, seemed to be roused to exertion in Po∣merania,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> during the severity of the winter-season. The Prussian general Manteuffel had, on the twentieth day of January, passed the river Peene, overthrown the advanced posts of the enemy at Ziethen, and penetrated as far as the neighbour∣hood of Griesswalde; but finding the Swedes on their guard, he returned to Anclam, where his head-quarters were established. This insult was soon retaliated with interest. On the twenty-eighth day of the month, at five in the morning, a body of Swedes attacked the Prussian troops posted in the suburbs of Anclam, on the other side of the Peene, and drove them into the city, which they entered pell-mell. General Manteuffel, being alarmed, endeavoured to rally the troops, but was wounded and taken, with about two hundred men and three pieces of cannon. The victors, having atchieved this exploit, returned to their own quarters. As for the Russian army, which had wintered on the other side of the Vistula, the season was pretty far advanced before it could take the field; though general Tottleben was detached from it, about the beginning of June, at the head of ten thousand Cossacks, and other light troops, with which he made an irruption into Pomerania, and established his head quarters at Belgard.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Skir∣mishes between the Prus∣sians and Austrians in Saxo∣ny.</NOTE> At the beginning of the campaign the king of Prussia's chief aim was to take measures for the preservation of Silesia, the conquest of which seem∣ed to be the principal object with the court of Vienna. While the Austrian army, under marechal count Daun, lay strongly intrenched in
<PB N="60" REF="610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the neighbourhood of Dresden, the king of Prussia had endeavoured, in the month of December, to make him quit that advantageous situation, by cutting off his provisions, and making an irruption into Bohemia. For these purposes he had taken possession of Dippeswalde, Maxen, and Pretchen∣dorff, as if he intended to enter Bohemia by the way of Passberg; but this scheme being found impracticable, he returned to his camp at Frey∣berg; and in January the Prussian and Austrian armies were cantoned so near each other, that daily skirmishes were fought with various success. The head of the Prussian camp was formed by a body of four thousand men under general Zett∣witz, who, upon the twenty-ninth day of January, was attacked with such impetuosity by the Aus∣trian general Beck, that he retreated in great con∣fusion to Torgau, with the loss of five hundred men, eight pieces of artillery, and a considerable quantity of new cloathing, and other baggage. Another advantage of the same nature was gained by the Austrians at Neustadt over a small body of Prussians who occupied that city. In the month of March general Laudohn advanced with a strong detachment of horse and foot, in order to surprise the Prussians, who, in attempting to effect a re∣treat to Steinau, were surrounded accordingly, and very roughly handled. General Laudohn sum∣moned them twice by sound of trumpet to lay down their arms; but their commanders, the cap∣tains Blumenthal and Zittzwitz, rejecting the pro∣posal with disdain, the enemy attacked them on all hands with a great superiority of number. In
<PB N="61" REF="620"/>
this emergency the Prussian captains formed their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> troops into a square, and by a close continued fire kept the enemy at bay; until, perceiving that the Croats had taken possession of a wood between Siebenhausen and Steinau, they, in apprehension of being intercepted, abandoned their baggage, and forced their way to Steinau, which they reached with great difficulty, having been conti∣nually harrassed by the Austrians, who payed dear for this advantage. Several other petty exploits of this kind were atchieved by detachments on both sides, before the campaign was begun by the grand armies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Position of the armies in Saxony and Sile∣sia.</NOTE> Towards the end of April, the king of Prussia altered his position, and withdrew that part of his chain of cantonments, extending from the forest of Thurundt to the right of the Elbe. He now took possession of a very strong camp, between the Elbe and the Mulda, which he intrenched in every part that was accessible, and fortified with two hun∣dred and fifty pieces of cannon. By these precau∣tions he was enabled to keep his ground against the army of count Daun, and at the same time detach a body of troops as a reinforcement to his brother prince Henry, who assembled a separate army near Frankfort upon the Oder, that he might be at hand either to oppose the Russians, or march to the relief of Silesia, which the enemy was bent upon invading. It was for this purpose that the Austrian general Laudohn advanced with a consi∣derable army into Lusatia about the beginning of May, and general Beck with another body of troops took possession of Cotbus: mean while
<PB N="62" REF="630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> count Daun continued in his old situation on the Elbe; general Lacy formed a small detached army upon the frontiers of Saxony, to the southward of Dresden; and the prince de Deuxponts marched into the same neighbourhood with the army of the empire. Prince Henry of Prussia, having en∣camped with his army for some time at Sagan in Silesia, moved from thence to Gorlitz in Lusatia, to observe the motions of general Laudohn, en∣camped at Koningsgratz; from whence, in the be∣ginning of June, he marched into the county of Glatz, and advanced to the neighbourhood of Schweidnitz, which he seemed determined to be∣siege, having a train of eighty pieces of cannon. With a view to thwart his designs, prince Henry reinforced the body of troops under general Fou∣quet; and at the same time he sent a detachment into Pomerania under colonel Lessow, who de∣feated the rear▪guard of general Tottleben, and compelled that officer to evacuate Pomerania. By this time, however, the marechal Soltikoff had ar∣rived from Petersbourg, and taken the command of the grand Russian army, which passed the Vistula in June, and began its march towards the fron∣tiers of Silesia.</P>

Understanding that general Fouquet, who occu∣pied the post at Landshut, had weakened himself by sending off detachments under the major gene∣rals Ziethen and Grant, he resolved to attack him with such a superiority of number, that he should
<PB N="63" REF="640"/>

Accordingly, on the twenty-third<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> day of June, at two in the morning, he be∣gan the assault with his whole army upon some re∣doubts which Fouquet occupied, and these were carried one after another, though not without a very desperate opposition. General Fouquet, being summoned to surrender, refused to submit; and having received two wounds, was at length taken prisoner: about three thousand of his men escaped to Breslau; the rest were killed, or taken; but the loss of the victors is said to have exceeded that of the vanquished. In July general Laudohn under∣took the siege of Glatz, which was taken after a very faint resistance: for, on the very day that the batteries were opened against the place, the garri∣son abandoned part of the fortifications, which the besiegers immediately occupied. The Prussians made repeated efforts to regain the ground they had lost; but they were repulsed in all their at∣tempts. At length the garrison laid down their arms, and surrendered at discretion. From this tame behaviour of the Prussians, one would ima∣gine the garrison must have been very weak: a circumstance which we cannot reconcile with the known sagacity of the Prussian monarch, as the place was of great importance, on account of the immense magazine it contained, including above one hundred brass cannon, a great number of mortars, and a vast quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He un∣dertakes the siege of Bres∣lau;</NOTE> Laudohn, encouraged by his success at Glatz, advanced immediately to Breslau, which he began to bombard with great fury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Germans are in ge∣neral but indifferent engi∣neers, and little acquainted with the art of besieging. On this occasion the Austrian general had no other prospect than that of carrying the place by a sudden attack, or intimi∣dating count Tavenzein the governor, into an immediate surrender; for he knew the Russian army was at a consi∣derable distance, and judged from the character of prince Henry of Prussia, that he would advance to the relief of the place, long before it could be taken according to the usual forms. Influenced by these considerations, when he had invested the town, he sent a letter to the governor, specifying, that his army con∣sisted of fifty battalions and fourscore squadrons; that the Russian army, amounting to seventy-five thousand men, was within three days march of Breslau; that no succour could be expected from the king of Prussia, encamped as he was on the other side of the Elbe, and over-awed by the army of count Daun; that prince Henry, far from being in a condition to bring relief, would not be able to stand his ground against the Rus∣sians; that Breslau being an open mercantile town, not a fortress, could not be de∣fended without contravening the established rules of war; and therefore the governor, in case of obstinacy, had no reason to expect an honour∣able capitulation, the benefit of which was now offered. He, at the same time, sent a memorial to the civil ma∣gistrates, threatening their town with destruction, which could by no other means be prevented than by joining with the inhabitants in per∣suading the governor to em∣brace immediately the terms that were proposed. Count Tavenʗein, instead of being intimidated, was encouraged by these menaces, which im∣plied an apprehension in Laudohn, that the place would be relieved. He there∣fore replied to the summons he had received, that Breslau was not simply a mercantile town, but ought to be con∣sidered as a place of strength, as being surrounded with works and wet ditches: that the Austrians themselves had defended it as such after the battle of Lissa, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven; that the king his master having command∣ed him to defend the place to the last extremity, he could neither comply with general Loudohn's proposals, nor pay the least regard to his threats of destroying the town, as he had not been in∣trusted with the care of the houses, but with the defence of the fortifications. The Austrian convinced him that same evening, that he threat∣ened nothing but what he meaned to perform. He opened his batteries, and poured in upon the town a most terrible shower of bombs and red-hot bullets, which continued till midnight. Du∣ring this dreadful discharge, which filled the place with horror and desolation, he at∣tempted the outworks by assault. The Croats attack∣ed the covered way in diffe∣rent places with their usual impetuosity; but were re∣pulsed with considerable loss, by the conduct and resolution of the governor and garrison. These proceedings having made no impression upon Ta∣venzein, the besieging gene∣ral had recourse again to ne∣gociation, and offered the most flattering articles of ca∣pitulation, which were re∣jected with disdain. The go∣vernor gave him to under∣stand, that the destruction of the town had made no charge in his resolution, though it was a practice contrary to the law of arms, as well as to the dictates of common hu∣manity, to begin the siege of a fortress by ruining the in∣habitants: finally, he assured him he would wait for him upon the ramparts, and de∣fend the place to the utmost of his power. His observa∣tion was certainly just; no∣thing could be more infa∣mously inhuman than this practice of making war upon the helpless unarmed inhabi∣tants of a town, which has the misfortune to be be∣leaguered; yet the besieger pleaded the example of the P—m—, who had before acted the same tragedy at Dresden.

The prince, finding it impossible to pursue them by that route, directed his march to Glogau, where he learned that Bres∣lau was besieged by general Laudohn, and imme∣diately advanced by forced marches to its relief. Such was his expedition, that in five days he marched above one hundred and twenty English miles, and at his approach the Austrian general abandoned his enterprize. Thus, by his prudence and activity, he not only prevented the junction of the Russian and Austrian armies; but also saved the capital of Silesia, and hampered Laudohn in such a manner as subjected him to a defeat by the Prus∣sian monarch, to whose motions we shall now turn our attention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Prussia makes an unsuc∣cessful at∣tempt upon Dresden.</NOTE> Whether his design was originally upon Dresden, or he proposed to co operate with his brother prince Henry in Silesia, which his adversaries seemed to have pitched upon as the scene of their operations, we cannot presume to determine: but certain it is, he, in the beginning of July, began his march in two columns through Lusatis; and count Daun being informed of his march, ordered his army to be put in motion. Leaving the army of the em∣pire, and the body of troops under Lacy, to guard Saxony in his absence, he marched with great ex∣pedition towards Silesia, in full persuasion that the Prussian monarch had thither directed his route. On the seventh day of July, the king knowing that Daun was now removed at a distance, repassed the Pulsnitz, which he had passed but two days before, and advanced with the van of his army towards
<PB N="67" REF="680"/>
Lichtenberg, in order to attack the forces of gene∣ral<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Lacy, who was there posted; but the Austrian retired at his approach. Then the army marched to Marienstern, where the king received intelli∣gence that count Daun was in full march for Lau∣ban, having already gained two marches upon the Prussians. Perhaps it was this intimation that de∣termined the king to change his plan, and return to the Elbe. On the eighth day of the month he re∣passed the Sprehe, in the neighbourhood of Baut∣zen, and marched towards Dresden with extraor∣dinary diligence. On the thirteenth his army hav∣ing passed the Elbe at Kadetz, on a bridge of boats, encamped between Pirna and Dresden, which last he resolved to besiege, in hope of reducing it be∣fore count Daun could return to its relief. How far this expectation was well-grounded, we must leave the reader to judge, after having observed, that the place was now much more defensible than it had been, when the last attempt of the Austrians upon it miscarried; that it was secured with a nume∣rous garrison, commanded by general Macguire, an officer of courage and experience. This governor being summoned to surrender, answered, that hav∣ing the honour to be intrusted with the defence of the capital, he would maintain it to the last extre∣mity. Batteries were immediately raised against the town on both sides of the Elbe; and the poor inhabitants subjected to a dreadful visitation, that their calamities might either drive them to despair, or move the heart of the governor to embrace ar∣ticles of capitulation: but these expedients proved ineffectual. Though the suburbs towards the

In this hope he was not disappointed: the Austrian general finding himself duped by the stratagem of the Prussian monarch, and being made acquainted with his enterprize against Dresden, instantly wheeled about, and marched back with such rapi∣dity, that on the nineteenth day of the month, he reached the neighbourhood of the capital of Sax∣ony. In consequence of his approach the king of Prussia, whose heavy artillery was now arrived, re∣doubled his efforts against the city, so as to reduce to ashes the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>edral church, the new square, se∣veral noble streets, some palaces, together with the curious manufactory of porcelaine. His ven∣geance must have been levelled against the citizens; for it affected neither the fortifications, nor the Austrian garrison, which count Daun found means to reinforce with sixteen battalions. This supply, and the neighbourhood of three hostile armies, rendered it altogether impossible to prosecute the siege with any prospect of success: the king, there∣fore, abandoned the undertaking, withdrew his troops and artillery, and endeavoured to bring Daun to a battle, which that general cautiously avoided.</P>

The king had nothing to oppose to superior numbers, but supe∣rior activity, of which he determined to avail him∣self without delay. Instead of making a feint towards Silesia, he resolved to march thither in earnest; and for that purpose, crossing the Elbe, encamped at Dallwitz, on the farther bank of the river, leaving general Hulsen with fifteen thousand men in the intrenched camp of Schlettow, to maintain his footing in Saxony. On the third day of August he began his march for Silesia, followed by count Daun with the grand Austrian army, while the detached body under Lacy took post at Rechenberg, and the imperial army encamped at Xesseldorf. Both the Prussians and Austrians marched at the rate of one hundred miles in five days: on the tenth the king took possession of the camp of Lignitz; and here he seemed in danger of being quite surrounded by the enemy, who oc∣cupied the whole ground between Parchwitz and Coffendau, an extent of thirty miles. Count Daun's army formed the centre of this chain, possessing the heights of Wahlstadt and Hochkirk: general Laudohn covered the ground between Jeschkendorf and Coschitz: the rising grounds of Parchwitz were secured by general Nauendorff; and M. de Beck, who formed the left, extended his troops beyond Cossendau.

The Prussians immediately passed the Katz∣bach to attack this general; but he made such a skilful disposition for a retreat towards the army of count Daun, that he not only baffled the endea∣vours of the king to bring him to action, but, by posting himself on the heights of Hennersdorff, anticipated his march to Jauer. In vain the Prus∣sian monarch attempted next day to turn the ene∣my on the side of the mountain, by Pomsen and Jagersdorff; the roads were found impassible to the ammunition-waggons, and the king returned to the camp at Lignitz.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">obtains a victory over Lau∣dohn;</NOTE> While he remained in this situation he received advice, that four and twenty thousand Russians, under count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder at Auras, where they intended to cross that river, and he concluded the enemy had form∣ed a design to close him in, and attack him with their joint forces. Daun had, indeed, projected a plan for surprising him in the night, and had ac∣tually put his army in motion for that purpose; but he was anticipated by the vigilance and good fortune of the Prussian monarch. That prince, reflecting that if he should wait for his adversaries in his camp, he ran the risque of being attacked at the same time by Lacy on his right, by Daun in his front, and by Laudohn on his left, he al∣tered his position, in order to disconcert their ope∣rations: and, on the fourteenth day of the month,
<PB N="71" REF="720"/>
marched to the heights of Psaffendorff, where he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> formed his army in order of battle. Receiving in∣timation, about two in the morning, that Laudohn was in full march, advancing in columns, by Ben∣nowitz, he divided his army into two separate bo∣dies. One of these remained on the ground, in order to maintain the post against any attempts that might be made by count Daun to succour Laudohn; and that this service might be the more effectually performed, the heights were fortified with batteries, so judiciously disposed as to impede and over-awe the whole Austrian army. The king, having taken this precaution, wheeled about with sixteen battalions and thirty squadrons, to fall upon Laudohn as he should advance; but that general knew nothing of his design, until he himself ar∣rived at the village of Psaffendorff about three in the morning, when the day dawning, and a thick fog gradually dispersing, the whole detachment of the Prussian army appeared in order of battle, in a well-chosen situation, strengthened with a nume∣rous train of artillery, placed to the best advantage. Laudohn was not a little mortified to find himself caught in his own snare; but he had advanced too far to recede, and therefore, making a virtue of necessity, resolved to stand an engagement. With this view he formed his troops, as well as the time, place, and circumstances would permit; and the Prussians advancing to the attack, a severe action ensued. The king rode along the line to animate the troops, and superintended every part of the charge, hazarding his life in the most dangerous scenes of the battle to such a degree, that his horse
<PB N="72" REF="730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> was killed under him, and his cloaths were shot through in several places. The Austrians main∣tained the conflict with great obstinacy until six in the morning, when they gave ground, and were pursued to the Katzbach, beyond which the king would not allow his troops to prosecute the advan∣tage they had gained, that they might be able to succour the right, in case marechal count Daun should succeed in his attempt to advance against them from Lignitz. That general had actually begun his march to fall upon the Prussians on one side, while Laudohn should attack them on the other; but he was not a little surprised to find they were decamped, and when he perceived a thick cloud of smoke at a distance, he immediately com∣prehended the nature of the king's management. He then attempted to advance by Lignitz; but the troops and artillery which had been left on the height of Psaffendorff, to dispute his march, were so advantageously disposed as to render all his ef∣forts abortive. Laudohn is said to have lost in the action about eight thousand men, killed, wounded, and taken, including eighty officers, with twenty-three pair of colours, and eighty-two pieces of cannon: over and above this loss, the Austrian ge∣neral suffered greatly by desertion. The Prussians obtained the victory at the expence of one general, with five hundred men killed, and twelve hundred wounded. Immediately after the action the victor marched to Parchwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z; while Daun detached prince Lowenstein and general Beck, with the reserve of his army, to join prince Czernichew, who had crossed the Oder at Auras; but he was so intimi∣dated

by the defeat at Lignitz, that he forthwith<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> repassed the river, and prince Lowenstein retired on the side of Jauer.

The king, having freed Breslau from the neighbourhood of his ene∣mies, and being strengthened by the junction with his brother, lest a considerable detachment under the command of general Goltze, to protect the country against the Russian irregulars; and ad∣vanced with his whole force to the relief of Sch∣weidnitz, which was blocked up by the Austrian army under the command of the marechal count Daun. In his march he fell upon a separate body under general Beck, made two battalions of Croats prisoners, and dispersed several squadrons.

Un∣derstanding that the army of the empire had formed a design to cut off his communication with Torgau, he quitted his camp at Meissen, and marched to Strehla. The enemy having divided their forces into two bodies, one of them, on the twentieth day of August, attacked an advanced post of the Prussians; while the other was disposed in such a manner as to over-awe Hulsen's camp, and prevent him from taking any step for the re∣lief of his battalions, who maintained their ground with difficulty against the superior number of the assailants. In this emergency the Prussian general ordered his cavalry to make a circuit round a rising▪ground, and, if possible, charge the enemy in flank. This order was executed with equal vigour and suc∣cess. They fell upon the imperial army with such impetuosity, as drove their battalions and horse upon each other in the utmost confusion. A con∣siderable number of the enemy were slain, and forty-one officers, with twelve hundred men, made prisoners. By this advantage, which was obtained at a very small expence, general Hulsen opened for himself a way to Torgau, whither he instantly retreated, perceiving that the whole army of the Imperialists was advancing to cut off his commu∣nication with the Elbe: this retreat furnished the enemy with a pretext for claiming the victory.</P>

Bodies of Austrian troops scoured the country of Lusatia: the Russians tra∣versed part of Silesia, and made irruptions even into Brandenburg: the imperial army domineered in Saxony: the Swedish army, meeting with no opposition, advanced into the heart of Pomerania: so that the king was not only threatened on every side, but all correspondence between him and his hereditary dominions was at this <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>In this uncomfortable situation he is said to have written the following letter to the marquis D'Argens, au∣thor of the Jewish Spy, and several other elegant perform∣ances, a native of France, but residing at Berlin under the shadow of the king's protec∣tion and friendship.</P>
<P>"Formerly, my dear mar∣quis, the affair of the 15th of August would have decided a campaign. At present that action is no more than a scratch; a great battle must determine our fate. We shall have one, according to all ap∣pearances, very soon; and then, if the event is favour∣able to us, we may rejoice. It required many stratagems and much address to bring things to this pass. Don't talk to me of danger; the last action cost me only a suit of cloaths and a horse This is buying victory very cheap.</P>
<P>I have not had the letter which you mention. We are in a manner blocked up, in regard to correspondence, by the Russians on one side the Oder, and by the Austrians on the other. A small skir∣mish was necessary to clear the way for Cocceii; I hope that he will deliver you my letter; I never was, in the course of my life, in a more embarrassing situation than in this campaign. Believe me, nothing less than a mi∣racle is still necessary to ex∣tricate me from the difficul∣ties that I foresee. I shall certainly do my duty when occasion offers: but, my dear marquis, always remember that I pretend not to com∣mand fortune, and that I am obliged, in my projects, to leave too much to chance, for want of being able to form any more solid I have the labours of a Hercules to undergo, at a time of life when my strength fails me, my infirmities increase, and, to speak the truth, when hope, the only consolation of the unhappy, begins to de∣sert me. You are not suffi∣ciently acquainted with the circumstances of affairs to have a clear idea of all the dangers which threaten the state: I know, but conceal them; I keep all my fears to myself, and only communi∣cate to the public my hopes, or the little good news that I can acquaint them with. If the blow that I meditate suc∣ceeds, then, my dear marquis, it will be time enough to ex∣press our joy: but till then, let us <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot flatter oursel es, for fear some unexpected bad news should deject us too much.</P>
<P>I lead here the life of a military monk. I have much to think of about my affairs, and the rest of my time I devote to literature, which is my consolation, as it was of the consul, the father of his country and of eloquence. I know not if I shall survive this war; but I am deter∣mined, in case it should hap∣pen, to pass the rest of my days in retirement, in the bo∣som of philosophy and friend∣ship.</P>
<P>When our correspondence shall be more open, you'll oblige me by writing more frequently. I know not where we shall have our winter∣quarters. My houses at Bres∣lau were destroyed by the bombardment. Our enemies envy us every thing, even day∣light and the air we breathe. They must however leave us some place, and if it is safe, it will be a treat to receive you there.</P>
<P>Well, my dear marquis, what is become of the peace with France? Your nation, you see, is more blind than you imagined. Those fools lose Canada, and Pondicher∣ry, to please the queen and the czarina. Heaven grant that prince Ferdinand may well reward them for their zeal. The officers, innocent of these evils, and the soldiers, will be made the victims, and the illustrious offenders will suffer nothing.</P>
<P>These are the subjects which offer themselves to me. I was in a writing vein, but I see that I must con∣clude, lest I should tire you and neglect my own busi∣ness. Adieu, my dearest marquis.—I embrace you, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> juncture inter∣cepted.</P>

The Russian army being on its retreat from Silesia, count Czernichew was sent with a strong detachment into the Marche of Branden∣burg, while a numerous body of Austrians, un∣der Lacy and Brentano, penetrated into the same country from Saxony, with instructions to join the Russians at the gates of Berlin. The Prussian ge∣neral Hulsen, finding himself too weak to cope with the army of the empire in Misnia, had fallen back to this capital, where he was joined by the troops under general Werner, lately returned from Pomerania: but as their forces, after this junction, did not exceed sixteen thousand men, and the al∣lies advancing against them amounted to forty thousand, they would not pretend to oppose the enemy in the open field, nor to defend a city of such extent, and so imperfectly fortified. Such an attempt would have only exposed their troops to ruin, without being able to save the capital, which, on the contrary, would have been the more severe∣ly handled, in consequence of their opposition. They therefore resolved to retire, after having re∣pulsed

They made no resist∣ance, however; but on the first summons pro∣posed articles of capitulation, which being refused, they surrendered themselves prisoners of war. In favour of the city the foreign ministers there re∣siding, interposed their mediation with such zeal and success, that tolerable conditions were ob∣tained. The inhabitants were indulged with the free exercise of their religion, and an immunity from violence to their persons and effects. The enemy promised that the Russian irregulars should not enter the town; and that the king's palace should not be violated. These articles being rati∣fied, the Austrian and Russian troops entered the place, where they totally destroyed the magazines, arsenals, and founderies, with an immense quan∣tity of military stores, and a great number of can∣non and small arms: then they demanded the im∣mediate payment of eight hundred thousand guil∣ders; and afterwards exacted a contribution of one million nine hundred thousand German crowns. Many outrages were committed by the licentious soldiery, in spite of all the precautions which the officers could take to preserve the most exact dis∣cipline. The houses of the private inhabitants were tolerably protected; but the king's palaces

<P><HI>Published at Berlin by Autho∣rity.</HI></P>
<P>However enormous the cruelties were, to which the king's dominions were a prey last year, one would imagine that his majesty's enemies wanted to out-do themselves in this respect, by their bar∣barous conduct this year. It would in fact seem, that after four unsuccessful campaigns, they thought they should more easily obtain their ends, by means equally shocking to humanity, and inconsistent with the practice of civilized nations, than by endeavour∣ing to terminate the war by arms, and the superiority of their forces.</P>
<P>In this light all the opera∣tions of this campaign, and in particular the famous ex∣pedition against Berlin, natu∣rally present themselves be∣fore the impartial public. The whole united forces of the house of Austria, in con∣junction with the numerous armies of Russia, have over∣run Silesia, not with a view to fight battles, or get posses∣sion of the fortresses by re∣gular sieges; but to carry fire and sword into a pro∣vince, which they are pleased to consider at Vienna as part of the incontestable domini∣ons of the house of Austria. Towns that were already laid under contribution, have, ne∣vertheless, been plundered and sacked: Landshut, in parti∣cular, furnishes a memorable example of this conduct, so contrary to all the laws of war. The capital, and other fortresses in Silesia, of which they could not make them∣selves masters by stratagem, or other indirect methods, for want of artillery to lay siege to them, have been bombarded without any hopes of success: one would think they did it only for the plea∣sure of beholding a great number of houses and public edifices, on fire.</P>
<P>That unfortunate province would doubtless have been ir∣recoverably ruined, had not Providence thought proper to set bounds to their excesses, and to humble them by an event which destroyed all their flattering hopes. The battle of Lignitz stopt the execu∣tion of their vast designs, and disconcerted their plan for the rest of the campaign. Three armies each of them supe∣rior in number to that of the king, which had even entirely surrounded him, and which counted so much on the suc∣cess of the measures they had taken to overwhelm him, that they had even fixed the day which was to decide his fate, were, by this victory, reduced for a long time to to∣tal inaction, and obliged to think more of defending themselves, than of forming offensive enterprises. The Russians retreated towards the frontiers of Poland, set∣ting fire to every place where they had received any loss, or apprehended an attack. The two Austrian armies shut themselves up in the hills of Silesia, and opposed those na∣tural barricades to the efforts which his majesty made to come to blows with them. There they waited for the is∣sue of the diversion which the policy of the court was to procure to be made. Mar∣shal Soltikoff remained the whole month of September, without daring to make the least motion, in presence of the small corps under general Goltz; the operations of his troops being confined to the desolating those parts of Lower Silesia that were in his power. But as this proceed∣ing could not deliver the Au∣strian army from its confined position, which in the end might prove fatal to it, the court of Vienna again had recourse to these methods, which it employs with so much success to extricate it∣self from a dilemma, and pre∣vailed with the Russians to invade the Marche of Bran∣denburgh.</P>
<P>For this end the generals Czernichef and Tottleben were detached with upwards of 20,000 men, and general Lacy was sent against Berlin with 14,000 from the Au∣strian army. The whole Russian army followed at a small distance, to sustain this grand enterprize. But each party wanting to get before the other, general Tottleben, without waiting for the ar∣rival of the large corps of troops, appeared on the 3d of October before Berlin, with 2000 light troops and some foot. He immediately sum∣moned it, and upon its refu∣sing to surrender, he threw into the town some hundreds of royal grenades, bombs, and red-hot balls, in hopes of obtaining by fire and by terror, what he could not promise himself from his for∣ces. The three assaults made on Halle-gate were repelled; and the flames, which had broke out in five different parts, were happily extin∣guished. The prudent mea∣sures taken by the Prussian generals who were at Berlin, at last obliged the Russian ge∣neral to retire without effect∣ing his purpose. Mean while, prince Eugene of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtem∣burgh, and lieutenant-gene∣ral Hulsen, had come to the assistance of the capital, and for some time put a stop to the enemy's enterprises: they would probably have obliged them wholly to drop their design, had not count Czer∣nichef, on one side, and ge∣neral Lacy on the other, come up with their troops. At the same time the grand Russian army arrived at Francfort on the Oder, and general Panin, with seven regiments, was detached towards Berlin, to sustain general Czernichef; and he could be followed every day by fresh detach∣ments.</P>
<P>The two Prussian generals above-mentioned, seeing the great superiority of the ene∣my, would not expose the city to the precarious issue of a battle, and resolved to give it time to capitulate, in order to prevent the calamities to which it might be exposed; accordingly they withdrew on the 6th, before day-break, to Spandau, and the governor and the magistrates made se∣parate capitulations with ge∣neral Tottleben. It was agreed that the town should be delivered up to the Rus∣sians; that the garrison, con∣sisting of two battalions of Itzenplitz's regiment, and one battalion of Ludenitz's mili∣tia, should be prisoners of war; and that, on paying a contribution of 1,500,000 crowns, and 200,000 as a gra∣tuity to the troops, for which the town was obliged to be∣come bound, it should enjoy full liberty, protection and safety, while the enemy sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in it. The prisoners, who, at the most, amounted but to 1200 men, and not to 4000, as the foreign news-papers have given out, were carried off; and the cadets, who could not be comprehended in the capi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti n, which mentions only generals, offi∣cers, subal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and soldiers, were carried away with the rest on foot. Though scarce above ten or twelve ye rs old, their tender age could not secure them from this hard usage▪ which we hear, hath already put an end to many of their lives.</P>
<P>According to the public news-papers, the Russian ge∣nerals divided them among themselves▪ to take the keep∣ing of them, as if they were slaves condemned to perpe∣tual capti <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.

<P>The capitulation made by general Tot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leben was no better observed▪ either by the Russians or Austrians. By the third article of the two capitulations for the garrison, and the town, it was settled, that no soldier should be quartered in the city or sub∣urbs; that the light troops should not be permitted to enter the place; and that both the royal palaces and private houses should be en∣tirely safe, and not be exposed to pillage: nevertheless, se∣veral Austrian regiments took up their quarters in the town, as hath just been mentioned. They even lived at discretion; and, not content with eating and drinking at the expence of their landlords, they com∣pelled them to give them mo∣ney, goods, and whatever they asked. There are but few inhabitants of Berlin, whom these guests did not cost hundreds or thousands of crowns. The town was, in a manner, over-run with cos∣sacks, hussars, and other light troops, who robbed both in the streets and in the houses, and wherever they came. Nor was the regular troops wholly free from this re∣proach; the Austrians, in particular, distinguished them∣selves in these exploits. On a careful enquiry it hath been found, that 282 private houses were broke and plun∣dered, and the inhabitants compelled, by the most bar∣barous acts of violence, to part with money, watches, and whatever the soldiers had a mind to. A very great number of persons were beat, cut with swords, and abused in such a cruel manner, that ma∣ny are still in danger of their lives from the wounds they received. A woman named Schack was found dead on the quay of Collen, with her body disfigured by wounds. People scarce dared to appear in the streets for fear of be∣ing robbed; and most of those, whose business obliged them to be abroad in the evening, or at night, were stripped of every thing. The king's stables, which by the capitulation were not to be touched, were a principal object of the enemy's ravage, though the Russian com∣mander had placed there a safeguard of twenty-four <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> All his majesty's coaches, which could not, surely, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reckoned implements of war, were broke to pieces, after being stripped of the velvet, embroidery, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce; and the apartments of M.

The hospital for invalids, and the hospital called la Charité, those retreats of the unhappy, the infirm, and the indigent, which one would im<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gine, the most cruel enemy would have respected, were not spared, but pillaged, and ex∣posed to other excesses of different kinds. In the church of Jerusalem▪ the Austrians robbed the v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stry and the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s box, and opened some graves to strip the dead. It must be acknowledged, that general Tottie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n▪ and briga∣dier Bachman, who was ap∣pointed vice-governor, en∣deavoured to maintain order and discipline in the city, and that they even put a stop to some excesses committed by the troops: but most of the disorders were suffered to pass unpunished; and by the ex∣cesses committed in breach of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ the city sus∣tains a loss of some hundred thousand crowns, over and above the enormous contri∣bution exacted from it.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, what hap∣pened at Berlin was nothing compared to what was done in the small towns and the flat country, the whole, from the gates of Berlin to the dis∣tance of several miles, being laid totally desolate. In par∣ticular the Austrian, Russian, and Saxon troops joined to leave the most detestable marks of their rage and in∣humanity at the castle of Charlottenbourg. Esterha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i's Austrian hussars, and the Saxon uhlans, distinguished themselves in this exploit, and their officers looked on un∣concerned. Whole squadrons entered the castle on the 9th of October, and plundered it for four days successively, without receiving the least check from either general or officer. All the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apestry was torn down; looking-glasses, pictures, tables, chairs, china, in short, all that was of any value, was broke or spoilt, except a large quantity of ef∣fects which some greedy offi∣cers took for themselves, and sent away in covered wag∣go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Even the king's cha∣pel, that sacred place, which the most savage nations would have respected, was ravag∣ed, and profaned by their nastiness, and the organs broke. In the apartments of the castle, the pictures of the royal family were spoilt and disfigured, and several statues of the celebrated cabinet of cardinal Polignac, valuable monuments of antiquity, were muti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated or damaged. In short, such havock was made at this country-seat, that scarce any thing more than the walls can properly be said to be left. Nevertheless, the plunder got here did not sa∣tisfy the enemy's greediness, nor secure the inhabitants of the town from being plun∣dered, though they had ran∣somed themselves by the pay∣ment of 15000 crowns in ready money. Every thing was taken from them; and what could not be carried away was broke or destroy∣ed. Several inhabitants were horsewhipped and cut with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; of which two died. Even the women, without dis∣tinction of age, were exposed to the rage of the enemy, and made victims of their brutality.</P>
<P>Schoenhausen, the queen's country-house, shared much the same fate. A Russian su∣baltern arrived there on the 8th of October, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight hussars, and demanded, with grievous threats, her majes∣ty's plate. In vain he was told, that it had been carried long before to a place of safe∣ty: they searched the castle, and not finding what they wanted, pulled down, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the tapestry and the cur∣tains, and, taking what they liked, went to the house of the keeper of the castle, stripped him and his wife, beat him with rods and whips, and even pinched them with red-hot pinchers in such a cru∣el manner, that both are still dangerously ill. The gene∣rals Czernichef and Tottle∣ben, being informed of these cruelties, promised, indeed, to put a stop to them; but instead thereof, the castle was totally desolated between the 9th and the 12th. All the tapestry and curtains left af∣ter the former visit were torn, and the chairs, pictures, and china, broke to pieces. In short, Schoenhausen was made a desart; nor did the officers b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>longing to it, or the village of Pankow, which adjoins to it, fare better. A servant be∣longing to the castle was laid on the fire in his own apart∣ment, and the minister's foot∣man hacked to death with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abres. The women were dis∣honoured in the most barba∣rous manner: all the cattle were driven away, and every house and barn emptied.</P>
<P>The palace of the margrave Charles at Friedrichfelde re∣ceived the same treatment from the Russians; and most of the provincial towns met with no more favour. Frank∣fort, in particular, was most grievously harrassed many ways, though the enemy's generals had given the magis∣trates assurances in writing, that they had no farther ex∣actions to fear. Lieutenant colonel R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hewsky lighted a large fire in the great square, with which he threatened to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the city in flames. A burgomaster was whipped in a cruel manner, and all the magistrates threatened with the same treatment. By these violent measures they ex∣torted great quantities of cloth, li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and forage, and a contribution of 50,000 crowns, besides what was given under the title of ex∣traordinaries, which, how∣ever, did not prevent many acts of cruelty and robbery from being committed in that town, where the damage amounts to above 200,000 crowns.</P>
<P>The fate of Copenick, Furstenwalk, Beskow, Alt-Lansberg, Strasberg, O∣rangeberg, Lubenwalde, and, in general, all the towns in the Marcne▪ where the ene∣my came, was equally hard. They were forced to pay con∣tributions, and to furnish things much above their abi∣lities, and, after all, were ex∣posed to pillage and shocking acts of cruelty. But nothing can come up to the dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight which the flat country presents, from Berlin to the frontiers of Poland, Silesia, and Saxony, wherever the enemy have been. The vil∣lages are entirely plundered, and the country people left de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute both of corn and cattle. Their beds, their fur∣niture, and, in short, all they had, is carried off. The corn which the enemy could not use, or carry off, they scat∣tered about, and threw into the dirt. All the cattle, cows, as well as horses, oxen, and sheep, were taken: a∣bove 100,000 head had passed through Frankfort. Some villages were set on fire, particularly Schoneberg and Grossen▪Beer. In short, wherever they came, they beat and abused the inhabi∣tants in the most cruel man∣ner, and barbarously disho∣noured the women▪ without distinction of age or condi∣tion, in presence of their pa∣rents and husbands. In fine, to fill up the measure of their deeds of inhumanity and hor∣ror, they laid aside all regard to the sepulchres of the dead, which have always been held in a kind of veneration by the most barbarous nations. The troops under general Lacy, in their return thro' Wilmersdorff, an estate be∣longing to the Schwerin fa∣mily, broke open the bury∣ing vault, opened the coffin of the master of the horse to the king, who had been dead 12 years, and those of his lady and children, stript the bo∣dies, and threw them on the ground. These barbarities, of which the history of the least civilized nations fur∣nishes few examples, will be handed down to the most dis∣tant posterity, and perpetuate the shame of Prussia's ene∣mies.</P>
<P>What is said above, is only a brief summary▪ and as it were the out-lines of the scene of devastation which the king's enemies made in the Marche in their last in∣vasion. A detail of particu∣lars would fill volumes. But no fact has been mentioned, but what any one may be convinced of by the testimony of their own senses. We have not taken the liberty to make ill grounded and exag∣gerated complaints, such as are those of a court, which employs venal pens to excite false compassi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, by magni∣fying the evils it hath brought on itself through its own fault. It is well known how it filled Europe with its cla∣mours, when its capital, de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended by its allies as if it had been a regular fortress, sustained, more thro' their fault, than that of the be∣siegers, the natural conse∣quence of a siege; while it appears quite insensible at the fate of the city of Witten∣berg, which those very allies reduced to ashes without any necessity, and almost without having fired against the ram∣parts. It forgets probably, or wants to make the public forget, that its allies made no scruple to bombard likewise without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>essity, and for the most part without success, Zittau, Schweidnitz, Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rin, Colberg, Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an, B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el: and that in this man∣ner they reduced a part of those towns to ashes, and greatly damaged the rest. That court would at present have great reason to make the most serious reflections on the obligation it lies un∣der to its troops, and those of its allies, for the conduct they have held, if the king were disposed to follow bad exam∣ples, and to retaliate on the subjects of Saxony the cala∣mities which his subjects have been so unjustly made to suf∣fer. But his majesty's man∣ner of thinking will always prevent
his recurring to such rigorous methods, till he be forced to it by indispensable necessity. He de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this illi∣cit manner of making war the more, as it contributes so little to the end for which war is waged. This truth ap∣pears evident from the last expedition of the enemy into the Marche. They found it very easy to slip, as it were, into Brandenburgh, with an army of 80▪000 men, and to make themselves masters of an open city defended by a handful of men. But as soon as his ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty, informed of this invasion, flew to the as∣sistance of his oppressed sub∣jects, and approached the frontier only, all those troops of the enemy fled precipi∣tately, and retired, some to Poland, and some to Saxony. It is not denied that they did hurt; but the damage is not irreparable, and can have no influence on the future ope∣rations of the war. The di∣version which the enemy pro∣posed to make by it, far from favouring their affairs in Sax∣ony, and Silesia, hath given the king an opportunity to reconquer the former, and to deliver the latter. Thus Haddick's enterprize against Berlin was followed in 1757, by the glorious victories of Rosbach and Lissa. The late expedition of the Russians and Austrians against Berlin hath served, notwithstanding all that hath been published, to ruin, without any reason, and without any end, some thou∣sands of innocent subjects. But it hath displayed the ene∣mies of Prussia, in their true colours, to all Europe, and laid open the falsity, the in∣justice, and the cruelty of the principles on which they act, in this war. It should seem that the court of Vienna wanted to realise, on this oc∣casion, the shocking expres∣sion of one of its generals, "That they must leave the subjects of Brandenburgh on∣ly free air and the bare ground." Unable hitherto to crush the king, the mag∣nanimous defender of the German liberties, it again hath recourse to those me∣thods which the Ferdinands [of Austria] employed in the last century, to reduce the whole empire under their despotic yoke. By its con∣duct in our days, it renews the sad remembrance of that long and bloody war which Germany then groaned un∣der, for the space of thirty years. Let all Europe consi∣der at present what it hath to expect from such an enemy. Let it judge whether the house of Austria, in case it could accomplish the depres∣sion of that of Brandenburgh, would not extend in its ambi∣tious views farther; and, to gain its end, seek to involve other states in the calamities in which it wants to plunge those of his majesty. But Providence, which hath al∣ready so often defeated the projects of this house, and which hath recently humbled its pride by the defeat at Tor∣gau, will still set fresh bounds to its ambition in the sequel of this war. We must hope that by it's assistance, the king will continue to defend him∣self successfully against the league formed against him by the infinuations and intrigues of the court of Vienna; and that all the efforts of his ene∣mies will not prevent the most distant posterity from acknowledging him to have been the defender of the Pro∣testant religion and the liber∣ties of Germany.</P>
<P><HI>The following is an Answer to the foregoing relation of the ravages committed by the Austrians, Russians, and Sax∣ons, in Brandenburgh, pub∣lished at Dresden, and re∣printed in the Brussels Ga∣zette.</HI></P>
<P>The inhabitants of Berlin have been more frightened than hurt. As they had, by their acclamations and ap∣plauses, been accomplices in the excesses committed by their master in Saxony, they expected reprisals: but the generals of the two empres∣ses distinguished themselves as much at Berlin, by their generosity and compassion, as those of Prussia in Saxony by their obdurateness and bar∣barity. Yet the Prussian Ga∣zette hath the assurance to complain of a contribution of 1,800,000 crowns; of the plundering the arsenal, and the destruction of the pow∣der-mill. The generals La∣cy and Tottleben carried off the arms and uniforms that were in the king's magazines: they rendered unserviceable the royal foundery, which continually replaced in the enemies armies the artillery which the imperial troops took from them at the price of their blood. The furni∣ture of two country seats, the embellishments of which had been directed by the most rigorous oeconomy, was da∣maged by the soldiers, who, in other respects, observed the exactest discipline. Com∣pare the losses of the Prus∣sians with ours, and with those of the king-elector, whose august family, priso∣ners in their own palace, have seen the apartments of it broke open, the locks of the cabinets picked, their do∣mestics obliged to ransom themselves, their officers rob∣bed, the finest furniture fold by auction for a trifle, their country seats converted into hospitals and stables, till the rage of the Prussians reduced them to a heap of rubbish; the capital set on fire and burnt; the gardens that sur∣rounded it destroyed and dug up, from mere wantonness; the ornaments of them de∣stroyed by express order of the king of Prussia; our ar∣senal, which contained only rich and curious pieces, car∣ried to Berlin by an enemy whose destructive spirit is al∣ways subordinate to his avi∣dity; the castles and estates of the ministers and princi∣pal nobility and gentry demo∣lished and laid waste, after being several times ransomed; the men carried off from the towns and villages, the hou∣ses of the citizens plundered methodically, the magistrates thrown into dungeons, to compel them to deliver up the effects of the widow and the orphan; and to extort from the unfortunate inhabitants the little money they had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id from the Prussian tax-gather∣ers.</P>
<P>These are a part only of the distresses which the gene∣rals of the empresses had to take vengeance for. But their imperial majesties have too much magnanimity to make unhappy slaves answer∣able for what they did by the command of a despotic mas∣ter. It is the royal house of Prussia that owes satisfaction to the powers it hath offend∣ed. Its subjects, perhaps, have been long wishing in their hearts, that they may take it complete in the trea∣ty of peace.</P></NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> In the royal palace of Charlottenburg they pil∣laged

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Critical situation of the Prussian monarch.</NOTE> The body of Russians which entered Berlin, marched from thence into Poland, by the way of Furstenwalde, while the Austrians took the route of Saxony, from whence they had advanced in∣to Brandenburg. Mean while the town of Wir∣temberg, in that electorate, was reduced by the duke de Deux Ponts, commander of the impe∣ral army, which, in conjunction with the Au∣strians,
<PB N="91" REF="920"/>
made themselves masters also of Torgau<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 1760.</NOTE> and Leipsick.</P>
<P>The king of Prussia, in his march through Lusat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, was still attended by count Daun at the head of his grand army; and both passed the Elbe about the latter end of October. The Prussians crossed the river at Coswick, where he as joined by the troops under prince Eugene of Wirtemberg, and general Hulsen; so that his army now amounted to eighty thousand fighting men, with whom he resolved to strike some stroke of importance. Indeed, at this time his situation was truly critical. General Lau∣dohn, with a considerable body of Austrians, re∣mained in Silesia; the Russian army still threat∣ened Breslau, the capital of that country. The Imperialists and Austrians had taken pos∣session of all the great towns in Saxony, and were masters on both sides of the Elbe. In the eastern part of Pomerania the Russians had in∣vested Colberg by sea and land, seemingly deter∣mined to reduce the place, that they might have a sea-port, by which they could be supplied with provision, ammunition, necessaries, and reinforce∣ments, without the trouble and inconvenience of a long and laborious march from the banks of the Vistula.</P>
<P>On the western side of Pomerania, the war which had hitherto languished was renewed by the Swedes with uncommon vivacity. They passed the river Pene without opposition; and oblig∣ing general Stullerheim to retreat, advanced as far as Stransberg. That officer, however, be∣ing
<PB N="92" REF="930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> reinforced, attacked a Swedish post at Passel∣valik, slew about five hundred of the enemy, and took an equal number, with six pieces of cannon; but he was not numerous enough to keep the field against their whole army.</P>
<P>Thus the Prussian monarch saw himself obliged to abandon Silesia, deprived of all the places he held in Saxony, which had been his best re∣source; and in danger of being driven into his hereditary country of Brandenburg, which was unable either to maintain, or even to recruit his army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He at∣tacks the Austrian army at Torgau.</NOTE> On this emergency he resolved to make one des∣perate effort against the grand Austrian army, un∣der count Daun, who had passed the Elbe at Tor∣gau, and advanced to Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enburg, from whence, however, he retreated to his former camp at Tor∣gau, and the king chose his situation between this last place and Schilda, at Lang Reichenbach, where his hussars attacked a body of horse under general Brentano, and made four hundred pri∣soners. The right wing of the Austrians being at Groswich, and their left at Torgau, the Prus∣sian king determined to attack them next day, which was the third of November. His design was to march through the wood of Torgau by three different routes, with thirty battalions and fifty squadrons of his left wing: the first line was ordered to advance by the way of Mackrene to Neiden; the second, by Peckhutte to Elsni k; and the third, consisting of cavalry, to penetrate by the wood of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ayn to Vogelsang.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> On the other hand general Ziethen was directed to take the great Leipsick road, with thirty batta∣lions and seventy squadrons of the right; and quitting it at the ponds of Torgau, to attack the villages of Suptitz and Groswich. The king's line in its march, fell in with a corps of Austrians under general Reid, who retired into the wood of Torgau; and another more considerable body, posted in the wood of Wildenhayn, likewise re∣treated to Groschutz, after having fired some pieces of artillery: but the dragoons of St. Ignon, being enclosed between two columns of Prussian infan∣try, were either killed or taken. By two in the afternoon the king had penetrated through the wood to the plain of Neiden, from whence an∣other body of the enemy retired to Torgau, where a continued noise of cannon and small arms declared, that general Zeithen was already engaged. The Prussians immediately advanced at a quicker pace, and passing the morasses near Neiden, inclined to the right in three lines, and soon came to action. Daun had chosen a very advantageous position: his right extended to Groswich, and his left to Zinne; while his infantry occupied some eminences along the road of Leipsick; and his front was strength∣ened with no less than two hundred pieces of cannon. His second line was disposed on an extent of ground, which terminated in hillocks towards the Elbe; and against this the king di∣rected his attack.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="950"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> He had already given his troops to under∣stand, that his affairs were in such a situation, they must either conquer or perish: and they be∣gan the battle with the most desperate impe∣tuosity; but they met with such a warm re∣ception from the artillery, small arms, and in particular from the Austrian carbineers, that their grenadiers were shattered and repulsed. The second charge, though enforced with in∣credible vigour, was equally unsuccessful: then the king ordered his cavalry to advance, and they fell upon some regiments of infantry with such fury as obliged them to give way. These, however, were compelled to retire, in their turn, before about seventy battalions of the enemy, who advanced towards Torgau, stretch∣ing with their right to the Elbe, and their left to Zinne. While the prince of Holstein rallied his cavalry, and returned to the charge, the third line of Prussian infantry attacked the vineyard of Suptitz, and general Ziethen with the right wing took the enemy in rear. This disposition threw the Austrians into disorder, which was greatly augmented by the disaster of count Daun, who was dangerously wounded in the thigh, and carried off the field of battle. But the Prussians could not pursue their vic∣tory, because the action had lasted until nine, and the night, being unusually dark, facilitated the retreat of the enemy, who crossed the Elbe on three bridges of boats, thrown over the river at Torgau.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="960"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> The victor possessed the field of battle, with seven thousand prisoners, including two hundred officers, twenty-nine pair of colours, one stan∣dard, and about forty pieces of cannon. The carnage was very great on both sides: about three thousand Prussians were killed, and five thousand wounded; and, in the first attacks, two general officers, with fifteen hundred sol∣diers, were made prisoners by the enemy. The king, as usual, exposed his person in every part of the battle, and a musquet-ball grazed upon his breast. In the morning the king of Prussia entered Torgau; then he secured Meissen, and took possession of Freyberg; so that, in conse∣quence of this well-timed victory, his position was nearly the same as at the opening of the cam∣paign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Both ar∣mies go into quar∣ters of canton∣ment.</NOTE> The Austrians, however, notwithstanding this check, maintained their ground in the neigh∣bourhood of Dresden; while the Prussians were distributed in quarters of cantonment in and about Leipsick and Meissen. As the Austrian general had, after the battle, recalled his de∣tachments, general Laudohn abandoned Land∣shut, which again fell into the hands of the Prus∣sians, and the Imperial army was obliged to retire into Franconia.</P>
<P>The Swedes, having penetrated a good way into Pomerania, returned again to their winter-quarters at Stralsund; and the Russian generals measured back their way to the Vistula: so that the confederates gained little else in the course of this campaign, but the contributions which
<PB N="96" REF="970"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> they raised in Berlin, and the open country of Brandenburg. Had all the allies been heartily bent upon crushing the Prussian monarch, one would imagine the Russians and Swedes might have joined their forces in Pomerania, and made good their winter-quarters in Brandenburg, where they could have been supplied with magazines from the Baltick, and been at hand to com∣mence their operations in the spring: but, in all probability, such an establishment in the em∣pire would have given umbrage to the Germanic body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The diets of Poland and Swe∣den as∣sembled.</NOTE> The diet of Poland being assembled in the beginning of October, the king entertained the most sanguine hope they would take some reso∣lution in his favour; but the partisans of Prussia frustrated all his endeavours: one of the depu∣ties protesting against holding a diet while there were foreign troops in the kingdom, the assembly broke up in a tumultuous manner, even before they had chosen a marechal.</P>
<P>The diet of Sweden, which was convoked about the same period, seemed determined to proceed upon business. They elected count Axel Ferson their grand marechal, in opposition to count Horn, by a great majority; which was an unlucky circumstance for the Prussian interest at Stockholm, inasmuch as the same majority ob∣stinately persisted in opinion, that the war should be prosecuted in the spring with redoubled vigour, and the army in Germany reinforced to the number of at least thirty thousand fight∣ing men.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> This unfavourable circumstance made but little impression upon the Prussian monarch, who had maintained his ground with surprising resolutio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and success since the beginning of the campaig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and now enjoyed in prospect the benefit of winte which he is said to have termed his best auxiliary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intima∣tion given by the king of Prussia to the states of the circle of Westpha∣lia.</NOTE> The animosity which inflamed the contending parties was not confined to the operations in war; but broke out, as usual, in printed declarations, which the belligerant powers diffused all over Eu∣rope. In the beginning of the season the states of the circle of Westphalia had been required, by the Imperial court, to furnish their contingent of troops against the king of Prussia, or to commute for this contingent with a sum of money. In con∣sequence of this demand, some of the Westpha∣lian estates had sent deputies to confer with the assembly of the circle of Cologne; and to these the king signified, by a declaration, dated at Mun∣ster, that as this demand of money, instead of troops, was not less extraordinary than contrary to the constitutions of the empire, should they com∣ply with it, or even continue to assist his enemies either with troops or money, he would consider them as having actually taken part in the war against him and his allies, and treat them accord∣ingly on all occasions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Various com∣plaints exhibited to the diet at Ratisbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> This intimation seems to have produced little effect in his favour. The duke of Mecklenbourg adhered to the opposite cause; and the elector of Cologne co-operated with the French in their de∣signs against Hanover. By way of retaliation for this partiality, the Prussians ravaged the country
<PB N="98" REF="990"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> of Mecklenbourg, and the Hanoverians levied contributions in the territories of Cologne. The parties thus aggrieved had recourse to complaints and remonstrances. The duke's envoy at Ratis∣bon communicated a rescript to the Imperial minis∣ters, representing, that the Prussian troops under general Werner, and colonel de Belling, had dis∣tressed his country in the autumn by grievous ex∣tortions; that afterwards prince Eugene of Wir∣tembourg, in the service of Prussia, had demanded an exorbitant quantity of provisions, with some millions of money, and a great number of re∣cruits; or, in lieu of these, that the duke's forces should act under the Prussian banner. He there∣fore declared, that as the country of Mecklen∣bourg was impoverished and almost depopulated by these oppressions, the duke would find himself obliged to take measures for the future security of his subjects, if not immediately favoured with such assistance from the court of Vienna as would put a stop to those violent proceedings. This de∣claration was, by some, considered as the prelude of his renouncing his engagements with the house of Austria. As the Imperial court had threatened to put the elector of Hanover under the band of the empire, in consequence of the hostilities which his troops had committed in the electorate of Cologne, his resident at Ratisbon delivered to the ministers who assisted at the diet a memorial, remonstrating, that the emperor hath no power, singly, to sub∣ject any prince to the ban, or declare him a rebel; and that, by arrogating such a power, he exposed his authority to the same contempt into which the
<PB N="99" REF="1000"/>
pope's bulls of excommunication were so justly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> fallen. With respect to the elector of Cologne, he observed, that this prince was the first who commenced hostilities, by allowing his troops to co-operate with the French in their invasion of Hanover, and by celebrating with rejoicings the advantages which they had gained in that electo∣rate: he therefore gave the estates of the empire to understand, that the best way of screening their subjects from hostile treatment, would be a strict observance of neutrality in the present disputes of the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remon∣strance by the king of Poland</NOTE> This was a strain much more effectual among princes and powers, who are generally actuated by interested motives, than was the repetition of com∣plaints, equally pathetic and unavailing, uttered by the unfortunate king of Poland, elector of Saxony. The damage done to his capital by the last attempt of the Prussian monarch on that city, affected the old king in such a manner, that he published at Vienna an appeal to all the powers of Europe, from the cruelty and unprecedented out∣rages which distinguished the conduct of his ad∣versaries in Saxony. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>A memorial of the king of Poland, elector of Saxony. Published at Vienna, on the raising the siege of Dresden.</HI></P>
<P>"Since the troubles be∣gan, that desolate Germany, his majesty the king of Po∣land, elector of Saxony, hath been too often obliged to make just complaints to his high allies, to the diet of the empire, and to all Europe. Stript of his hereditary do∣minions by a neighbour, who, on entering them, asked only a passage through them, made protestations of friendship towards the sovereign, and declared he had no ground of complaint against him, nor any claim on the country; the king could not but look on the acts of hostility com∣mitted by the Prussians as so many injuries, as so many breaches of the law of na∣tions, and manifest violations of the laws of the empire. But things were soon carried to such a length, that Saxony would have thought herself too happy to find in the king of Prussia, not a depositary, but a declared enemy, pro∣vided this enemy would have respected the laws and cus∣toms of war, which humani∣ty prescribes, and which all civilized nations have hither∣to observed. She would not, in that case, have seen her towns subjected to contribu∣tions which exceed all mea∣sure; the suburbs of the ca∣pital set on fire, without ne∣cessity; the lands laid waste; and, what completes her mis∣fortunes, her young men torn from her by force, and con∣strained to bear arms against their sovereign: horrid treat∣ment! and so opposite to humanity, that it is without example, not among civilized nations only, but even among the greatest barbarians.</P>
<P>Sunk under such grievous oppressions, Saxony seemed to have no room to fear that her condition could be worse. Nevertheless, she hath found within the space of the last year, that fresh misfortunes were in reserve for her; and that, if the Prussians seemed for some time to preserve the country, it was only that they themselves might enjoy its produce. This tenderness was not dictated by humanity, but by interest. As the danger of being expelled Saxony in∣creased, they displayed their cruelty. If they quitted any part of the country without hope of returning, they gave it up to pillage: wherever they came, the unhappy pea∣sant was plundered without mercy; grain, forage, horses, cattle of all kinds, were taken from him; and he was left without subsistence. Whole families, and the best work∣men of all sorts, were carried off: even women found no safeguard in their sex; but all who were thought useful for Brandenburgh were torn from their families, and car∣ried into slavery.</P>
<P>The city of Dresden re∣mained. Notwithstanding the ruin of its suburbs, it still maintained a numerous peo∣ple: it was the resource of the neighbouring country. To complete the ruin of Sax∣ony, the unfortunate city was to be destroyed. Had the enemy attacked the place ac∣cording to the rules and cus∣toms of war, had they di∣rected their efforts against the ramparts, the king would, without doubt, have lament∣ed the evils that would have resulted from it to his people; but he would have lamented them without complaining: and though in the fiercest wars the residences of sove∣reigns have hitherto been ge∣nerally spared, his majesty would have been silent; for, in short, one is accustomed to consider the king of Prussia not as an ordinary enemy: but the Prussians made war on the innocent townsmen: their fire was wholly directed against the houses; and they endeavoured to destroy a town which they could not take.</P>
<P>The king cannot forbear pointing out to all Europe this remarkable circumstance, that the enemy redoubled their fire against the houses in Dresden, and did them the greatest damage, when the arrival of M. Daun, with his whole army, left them no hope of being able to take the place; and, in short, that in drawing off their men from the suburbs before Wils∣druff-gate, they laid in ashes upwards of an hundred houses that had escaped in the pre∣ceding fires. The king of Prussia succeeded in complet∣ing the misfortunes of Saxo∣ny by the disasters that besel the capital. Three hundred and fifty houses destroyed, with all that was in them, and a great many others half ruined, are a fatal loss to a city already exhausted by four successive years of misfor∣tunes. After these things, the king thinks it scarce worth while to mention his palaces and his gardens, which were sacked and ruin∣ed, in contempt of the re∣gard usually paid from one sovereign to another. Is there a man in the empire, or even in all Europe, who doth not see in these terrible effects an implacable hatred, and a de∣structive fury, which all na∣tions ought to concur in re∣pressing?</P>
<P>It is not to render his ene∣my odious, that the king holds up this picture to all the powers in Europe, and particularly to his co-estates, and his high allies; but in hopes of exciting them to redouble their efforts, with∣out delay, for the deliverance of Saxony, and not suffer that unfortunate country to be absolutely ruined, to move their compassion in favour of an innocent people, reduced to the utmost distress, and who can expect but a very feeble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from their sovereign, str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt himself of all things by acts of oppres∣sion, no loss violent than un∣foreseen.</P>
<P>This inability is of all his majesty's misfortunes the most severe. He loves his people. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th a father's bowels for them; and he sees them over∣whelmed with distress, with∣out being able to succour them. The king hath the consolation left of employ∣ing, in their favour, all that the goodness of his cause, his invariable love of justice, and the great sacrifices he hath made for the common ad∣vantage, and the preservation of the empire; in short, all the regard and attention that he may merit by his misfor∣tunes from the friendly pow∣ers. By all these titles he conjures those powers to take the properest measures for the relief and preservation of the subjects left him in Saxo∣ny.</P>
<P>As to what regards him personally, his majesty puts his whole trust in the sove∣reign master of kings, in that judge who searcheth the heart, and weigheth right in the scales of justice. He is encouraged to hope that he will, in the end, be pleased to enable him to dry up the tears of the Saxons, to guard them for the future from all external violence, and to en∣sure their domestic happiness by paternal government.</P>
<P>His conscience beareth him this precious witness, that he hath not drawn so many evils upon himself and his dominions by unjust or am∣bitious enterprizes. The jus∣tice of his cause is so evident, so incontestible, and even so fully acknowledged by every one, that he cannot be re∣fused an indemnification pro∣portioned to his losses, if in the future pacification any re∣gard be paid to justice and equity.▪</P></NOTE> All Europe pitied the hard

<P>From this detail of continental affairs, our at∣tention is recalled to Great Britain, by an incident
<PB N="103" REF="1040"/>
of a very interesting nature; an account of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> however, we shall postpone until we have recorded the success that in the course of this year attended the British arms in the East Indies. We have al∣ready observed, that colonel Coote, after having defeated the French general Lally in the field, and reduced divers of the enemy's settlements on the coast of Coromandel, at length cooped them up within the walls of Pondicherry, the principal seat of the French East India company, large, popu∣lous, well fortified, and secured with a numerous garrison, under the immediate command of their general. In the month of October admiral Ste∣vens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduc∣tion of Pondi∣cherry in the East Indies.</NOTE> sailed from Trincamaley with all his squa∣dron, in order to its being refitted, except five sail of the line, which he left under the command of captain Haldane to block up Pondicherry by sea, while Mr. Coote should carry on his operations by land. By this disposition, and the vigilance of the British officers, the place was so hampered as to be greatly distressed for want of provisions, even before the siege could be undertaken in form; for the rainy season rendered all regular approaches impracticable. These rains being abated by the twenty▪sixth day of November, colonel Coote di∣rected the engineers to pitch upon proper places for erecting batteries, that should enfilade or flank the works of the garrison, without exposing their own men to any severe fire from the enemy. Ac∣cordingly four batteries were constructed in dif∣ferent places, so as to answer these purposes, and opened altogether on the eighth day of December at midnight. Though raised at a considerable dis∣tance,
<PB N="104" REF="1050"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> they were plied with good effect, and the besieged returned the fire with great vivacity. This mutual cannonading continued until the twenty▪ninth day of the month, when the engi∣neers were employed in raising another battery near enough to effect a breach in the north west counterguard and curtain. Though the ap∣proaches were retarded some days by a violent storm, which almost ruined the works, the damage was soon repaired; a considerable post was taken from the enemy by assault, and afterwards re∣gained by the French grenadiers, through the timidity of the Sipoys, by whom it was occupied. By the fifteenth day of January, a second battery being raised within point-blank, a breach was made in the curtain; the west face and flank of the north-west bastion were ruined, and the guns of the enemy intirely silenced.</P>

<P>The taking of Chanderna∣gore, contrary to the faith of treaties, and of that neu∣trality which has always sub∣sisted between all European nations, and namely between the two nations in this part of India; and that imme∣diately after a signal service which the French nation had rendered the English, not only in taking no part against them with the Nabob of Ben∣gal, but in receiving them in their settlements, to give them time to recover from their first losses (as appears by the letters of thanks from Mr. Pigot himself, and from the council of Madrass to that of Pondicherry) added to the formal refusal of fulfilling the conditions of a cartel, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed upon between our respective masters, though it was at first accepted of by Mr. Pigot, and the commissaries were named on both sides to go to Sa∣drass, to settle amicably the difficulties which might oc∣cur in its execution, put it out of my power, with re∣spect to my court, to make or propose to Mr. Coote any capitulations for the town of Pondicherry.</P>
<P>The king's troops, and those of the company, sur∣render themselves, for want of provisions, prisoners of war of his Britannic majesty upon the terms of the car∣tel, which I reclaim equally for all the inhabitants of Pondicherry, as well as for the exercise of the Roman religion, the religious houses, hospitals, surgeons, chap∣lains, servants, &amp;c. referring myself to the decision of our two courts, for reparation proportioned to the violation of so solemn a treaty.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. Coote may take possession to-morrow morning at eight o'clock, of the gate of Villenour; and after to-morrow at the same hour, of that of Fort St. Louis; and as he has the power in his own hands, he will dictate such alterior dis∣positions to be made as he shall judge proper.</P>
<P>I demand, merely from a principle of justice and hu∣manity, that the mother and sisters of Reza Saib, be per∣mitted to seek an asylum where they please, or that they remain prisoners among the English, and be not de∣livered up into Mahomet Ally Cawn's hands, which are still red with the blood of the husband and father, that he has spilt, to the shame indeed of those who gave them up to him; but not less to the shame of the commander of the English army, who should not have allowed such a piece of bar∣barity to be committed in his camp.</P>

<P>The particulars of the cap∣ture of Chandernagore hav∣ing been long since transmit∣ted to his Britannic majesty, by the officer to whom that place surrendered, colonel Coote cannot take cogni∣zance of what passed on that occasion; nor can he admit the same as any way relative to the surrender of Pondi∣cherry.</P>
<P>The disputes which have arisen concerning the cartel concluded between their Bri∣tannic and most Christian majesties, being as yet unde∣cided, colonel Coote has it not in his power to admit, That the troops of his most Christian majesty, and those of the French East India company, shall be deemed prisoners of war to his Bri∣tannic Majesty, upon the terms of that cartel; but requires that they surrender themselves prisoners of war, to be used as he shall think consistent with the interests of the king his master.

<P>Colonel Coote will send the grenadiers of his regi∣ment, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock to∣morrow morning, to take possession of the Villenour∣gate; and the next morning, between the same hours, he will also take possession of the gate of Fort St. Louis.</P>

<P><HI>Articles proposed to colonel Coote by the chief of the Jesuits; to which no answer was re∣turned.</HI></P>
<P>The superior council of Pondicherry, authorized by the count de Lally, lieutenant-general of the armies of his most Christian majesty, and his commissary in India, to treat for the said town and its inhabitants, present the following articles to colonel Coote, commander of his Britannic majesty's troops on the coast of Coromandel.</P>
<P>Art. I. Upon the reduction of the place, its inhabitants shall not in any wise be in∣jured; their houses shall be preserved, and they shall re∣tain all their effects and mer∣chandize, with liberty of choice to convey them where∣ever they shall think proper, or to continue their dwelling in the said town, as new sub∣jects of his Britannic majes∣ty; and they shall be treated as the old subjects have usu∣ally been treated: accord∣ingly, those who have here∣tofore had possessions or ad∣vantages, shall not be de∣prived of them.</P>
<P N="2">II. They shall be main∣tained in the exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, in the same manner as has been practised under the French government. The churches and the houses of the eccle∣siastics and religious persons shall be preserved, together with every thing thereupon belonging, whether they be situated without or within the town. The missionaries shall have liberty of passing from place to place, and shall find, under the English flag, the same protection as under the French flag.</P>
<P N="3">III. Not only the buildings and houses belonging to pri∣vate persons, whether lay∣men, or ecclesiastics, or reli∣gious persons, shall be left in the condition they are, but also the buildings be∣longing to the company, as well as the fort, the ware∣houses, and the walls of the town, with all the fortifica∣tions, until the date of these last, that is to say, every thing of this kind, belonging to the company, shall be de∣cided by the two respective courts.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The papers of the re∣gistry and notary office, on which depend the fortunes of the inhabitants, shall be sent to France, without any ob∣stacle, by such conveyances as they shall think fit, who are now charged with them, and in whose possession they shall, in the mean time, re∣main.</P>
<P N="5">V. The treatment, herein before stipulated by the first article, for the inhabitants of Pondicherry, shall be ex∣tended to all the members of the council, company's agents, officers settled in the same town, and all others, who have been, or now are, in the service of the com∣pany; and so in like man∣ner to the merchants, whether Armenians, or of any other nation settled heretofore in Pondicherry for their trade.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The creoles, or natives of Mauritius and of Bourbon, amounting in number to for∣ty-one, including five officers, as well those who are in health, as those who have been wounded, or are inva∣lids, having served as volun∣teers, and not being soldiers, should have the liberty of re∣turning to their home by the first good opportunity they may find.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Safe-guards shall be granted to prevent disorder.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. All the foregoing articles shall be executed ac∣cording to good faith.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> but next morning took possession of the town and citadel, where he found a great quan∣tity
<PB N="107" REF="1080"/>
of artillery, ammunition, small arms, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> military stores; then he secured the garrison,
<PB N="108" REF="1090"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> amounting to above two thousand Europeans. Lally made a gallant defence, and had he been properly supplied with provision, the conquest of the place would not have been so easily atchieved. He certainly flattered himself with the hope of being supplied; otherwise an officer of his experience would have demanded a capitulation before he was reduced to the necessity of acquiescing in any terms the besieger might have thought pro∣per to impose. That he spared no pains to pro∣cure supplies, appears from an intercepted letter
<PB N="109" REF="1100"/>
written by this commander to Monsieur Raymond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> French resident at Pullicat.—The billet is no bad sketch of the writer's character, which seems to have a strong tincture of oddity and extravagance.</P>
<P>"Monsieur Raymond,—the English squadron is no more; Sir, of the twelve ships they had in our road, seven are lost, crews and all; the other four dismasted; and no more than one frigate hath escaped—therefore lose not an instant in sending chelingoes upon chelingoes, loaded with rice—The Dutch have nothing to fear now. Besides, ac∣cording to the law of nations, they are only re∣stricted from sending us provisions in their own bottoms; and we are no longer blockaded by sea—The salvation of Pondicherry hath been once in your power already: if you neglect this op∣portunity, it will be intirely your own fault—don't forget some small chelingoes also—offer great rewards—in four days I expect fourteen thousand Morattoes.—In short, risque all—attempt all—force all, and send us some rice, should it be but half a garse at a time."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the Bri∣tish squa∣dron wrecked in a storm.</NOTE> By the reduction of Pondicherry the French in∣terest was annihilated on the coast of Coromandel, and therefore of the utmost importance to the British nation. It may be doubted, however, whether colonel Coote, with all his spirit, vigi∣lance, and military talents, could have succeeded in this enterprize, without the assistance of the squadron, which co-operated with him by sea, and effectually excluded all succours from the besieged. It must be owned, for the honour of the service, that no incident interrupted the good understand∣ing
<PB N="110" REF="1110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> which was maintained between the land and sea officers, who vied with each other in contri∣buting their utmost efforts towards the success of the expedition. On the twenty-fifth day of De∣cember rear-admiral Steevens arrived with four ships of the line, having parted with rear-admiral Cornish and his division in stormy weather: but he joined them at Pondicherry before the place was surrendered.—On the first day of January a violent tempest obliged admiral Steevens to slip his cables and put to sea, where he parted with the rest of his squadron; and when in three days he returned to the road of Pondicherry, he had the mortification to find that his division had suf∣fered severely from the storm. The ships of war called the Duke of Acquitaine and the Sunderland foundered in the storm, and their crews perished: The Newcastle, the Queenborough, and Protector fireship, were driven on shore and destroyed; but the men were saved, together with the cannon, stores, and provisions. Many other ships sustained considerable damage, which, however, was soon repaired. Admiral Steevens having intercepted the letter inserted above from Lally to Raymond, immediately dispatched letters to the Dutch and Danish settlements on this coast, intimating, that notwithstanding the insinuations of general Lally, he had eleven sail of the line, with two frigates, under his command, all fit for service, in the road of Pondicherry, which was closely invested and blockaded both by sea and land. He therefore declared, that as in that case it was contrary to the law of nations for any neutral power to relieve
<PB N="111" REF="1120"/>
or succour the besieged, he was determined to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> seize any vessel that should attempt to throw pro∣vision into the place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of George II. king of Eng∣land.</NOTE> While the arms of Great Britain still prospered in every effort tending to the real interest of the nation, an event happened which, for a moment, obscured the splendour of her triumphs; and could not but be very alarming to those G—n allies, whom her liberality had enabled to maintain an ex∣pensive and sanguinary war of humour and ambition. On the twenty-fifth day of October, George II. king of Great Britain, without any previous disorder, was in the morning suddenly seized with the agony of death, at the palace at Kensington. He had risen at his usual hour, drank his chocolate, and in∣quired about the wind, as anxious for the arrival of the foreign mails; then he opened a window of his apartment, and perceiving the weather was serene, declared he would walk in the garden. In a few minutes after this declaration, while he remained alone in his chamber, he fell down upon the floor: the noise of his fall brought his at∣tendants into the room, who lifted him on the bed, where he desired in a faint voice that the princess Amelia might be called; but before she could reach the apartment he had expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but without ef∣fect; and indeed his malady was far beyond the reach of art; for when the cavity of the thorax or chest was opened, and inspected by the serjeant surgeons, they found the right ventricle of the heart actually ruptured, and a great quantity of blood discharged through the aperture into the
<PB N="112" REF="1130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> surrounding pericardium; so that he must have died instantaneously in consequence of the effu∣sion. The case however was so extraordinary▪ that we question whether there is such another instance upon record.—A rupture of this nature appears the more remarkable, as it happened to a prince of a healthy constitution, unaccustomed to excess, and far advanced beyond that period of life when the blood might be supposed to flow with a dangerous impetuosity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of that prince.</NOTE> Thus died George II. at the age of seventy-seven, after a long reign of thirty four years, distinguished by a variety of important events, and chequered with a vicissitude of character and fortune. He was in his person rather lower than the middle size, well shaped, erect, with eyes remarkably prominent, a high nose, and fair com∣plexion. In his disposition he is said to have been hasty, prone to anger, especially in his youth, yet soon appeased; otherwise mild, moderate, and humane; in his way of living temperate, regu∣lar, and so methodical in every branch of private oeconomy, that his attention descended to objects which a great king (perhaps) had better over∣look. He was fond of military pomp and parade; and personally brave. He loved war as a soldier; he studied it as a science; and corresponded on the subject with some of the greatest officers whom Germany had produced. The extent of his under∣standing, and the splendour of his virtue, we shall not presume to ascertain, nor attempt to display;—we rather wish for opportunities to ex∣patiate on his munificence and liberality; his ge∣nerous
<PB N="113" REF="1140"/>
reguard to genius and learning; his royal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> encouragement and protection of those arts by which a nation is at once benefited and adorned. With respect to his government, it very seldom deviated from the institutions of law; or en∣croached upon private property; or interfered with the common administration of justice. The cir∣cumstances that chiefly mark his public charac∣ter, were a predilection for his native country, and a close attention to the political interests of the Germanic body: points and principles to which he adhered with the most invincible for∣titude; and, if ever the blood and treasure of Great Britain were sacrificed to these considera∣tions, we ought not so much to blame the prince who acted from the dictates of natural affection, as we should detest a succession of ve—I m—rs, all of whom in their turns devoted themselves, soul and body, to the gratification of this passion, or partiality, so prejudicial to the true interest of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitu∣lation of the prin∣cipal events of his reign.</NOTE> The reign of George II. produced many revo∣lutions, as well in the internal schemes of oecono∣my and administration, as in the external projects of political connexions; revolutions that exposed the frailties of human nature, and demonstrated the instability of systems founded upon conve∣nience. In the course of this reign a standing army was, by dint of ministerial influence, in∣grafted on the constitution of Great Britain. A fatal stroke was given to the liberty of the press, by the act subjecting all dramatic writings to the inspection of a licenser. The great machine of
<PB N="114" REF="1150"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> corruption, contrived to secure a constant majo∣rity in p—t, was overturned, and the inven∣tor of it obliged to quit the reins of govern∣ment. Professed patriots resigned the principles which they had long endeavoured to establish, and listed themselves for the defence of that for∣tress against which their zeal and talents had been levelled. The management of a mighty kingdom was consigned into the hands of a motley admi∣nistration, ministers without knowledge, and men without integrity, whose councils were timid, weak, and wavering; whose folly and extrava∣gance exposed the nation to ridicule and contempt; by whose ignorance and presumption it was reduced to the verge of ruin. The kingdom was engaged in a quarrel truly national, and commenced a ne∣cessary war on national principles; but that war was starved, and the chief strength of the nation transferred to the continent of Europe, in order to maintain an unnecessary war, in favour of a family whose pride and ambition can be equalled by nothing but its insolence and ingratitude. While the strength of the nation was thus exerted abroad for the support of worthless allies, and a dangerous rebellion raged in the bowels of the kingdom, the s—n was insulted by his m—rs, who deserted his service at that critical juncture, and refused to resume their functions, until he had truckled to their petulant humour, and dis∣missed a favourite servant, of whose superior ta∣lents they were meanly jealous. Such an unpre∣cedented secession at any time would have merited the imputation of insolence; but at that period,
<PB N="115" REF="1160"/>
when their s—n was perplexed and embarrassed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> by a variety of dangers and difficulties; when his crown, and even his life, was at stake, to throw up their places, abandon his councils, and as far as in them lay, detach themselves from his for∣tune; was a step so likely to aggravate the dis∣order of the nation; so big with cruelty, ingra∣titude, and s—n, that it seems to deserve an appellation which, however, we do not think pro∣per to bestow. An inglorious war was succeeded by an ignominious p—ce, which proved of short duration; yet in this interval the Engl sh nation exhibited such a proof of commercial opulence, as astonished all Europe. At the close of a war which had drained it of so much treasure, and in∣creased the public debt to an enormous burden, it acquiesced under such a reduction of interest as one would hardly think the ministry durst have proposed, even before one half of the national debt was contracted.</P>
<P>A much more unpopular step was a law that passed for naturalizing the Jews; a law so odious to the people in general, that it was soon repealed, at the request of that m—r by whom it had been chiefly patronized. An ill-concerted peace was in a little time productive of fresh hostilities and an∣other war with France, which Britain began to prosecute under unfavourable auspices. Then the whole political system of G—y was inverted. The k—of E—d abandoned the interest of that house which he had in the former war so warmly espoused, and took into his bosom a p—e whom he had formerly considered as his inveterate
<PB N="116" REF="1170"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> enemy. The unpropitious beginning of this war against France being imputed to the misconduct of the ad—n, excited such a ferment among the people as seemed to threaten a dangerous in∣surrection. Every part of the kingdom resounded with the voice of dissatisfaction, which did not even respect the throne. The k—g found himself obliged to accept of a m—r presented by the people, and this measure was attended with conse∣quences as favourable as his wish could form. From that instant all clamour was hushed; all op∣position ceased. The enterprising spirit of the new minister seemed to diffuse itself through all the operations of the war; and conquest every where attended the efforts of the British arms. Now appeared the fallacy of those maxims, and the falshood of those assertions, by which former ministers had established and endeavoured to ex∣cuse the practices of c—n. The supposed dis∣affection, which had been insisted on as the source of parliamentary opposition, now intirely vanished; nor was it found necessary to use sinister means for securing a majority, in order to answer the pur∣poses of the administration. England, for the first time, saw a minister of state in full possession of popularity; the faithful servant of the crown, the universal darling of the people. Under the au∣spices of this minister, it saw a national militia formed, and trained to discipline, by the invincible spirit of a few patriots, who pursued this salutary measure in the face of unwearied opposition, dis∣couraged by the jealousy of a c—t, and ridiculed by all the venal retainers to a standing army. Un∣der

his auspices it saw the military genius of Great<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Britain revive, and shine with redoubled lustre; it saw her interest and glory coincide, and an im∣mense extent of country added by conquest to her dominions. The people, confiding in the inte∣grity and abilities of their own minister, and ele∣vated by the repeated sounds of triumph, became enamoured of the war, and granted such liberal subsidies for its suppo rt, as no other minister would have presumed to ask, as no other nation believed they could afford. Nor did they murmer at seeing great part of their treasure diverted into foreign channels; nor did they seem to bestow a serious thought on the accumulating load of the national debt, which already exceeded the immense sum of one hundred millions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His death universal∣ly lament∣ed.</NOTE> In a word, they were intoxicated with victory; and as the king happened to die in the midst of their transports, occasioned by the final conquest of Canada, their good humour garnished his cha∣racter with a prodigality of encomiums. A thousand pens were drawn to paint the beauties and sublimity of his character, in poetry as well as prose. They ex∣tolled him above Alexander in courage and heroism, above Augustus in liberality, Titus in clemency, An∣toninus in piety and benevolence, Solomon in wis∣dom, and St. Louis in devotion. Such hyperbolical eulogiums serve only to throw a ridicule upon a character, which may be otherwise respectable. The two universities vied with each other in la∣menting his death, and each published a huge col∣lection of elegies on the subject: nor did they fail to exalt his praise, with the warmest expressions of
<PB N="118" REF="1190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> affection and regret, in the compliments of con∣dolence and congratulation which they presented to his successor. The same panegyric and pathos appeared in all the addresses, with which every other community in the kingdom approached the throne of our present sovereign; insomuch that we may venture to say, no prince was ever more popu∣lar at the time of his decease. The English are na∣turally warm and impetuous; and, in generous natures, affection is as apt as any other passion to run riot. The sudden death of the king was la∣mented as a national misfortune by many, who felt a truly filial affection for their country; not that they implicitly subscribed to all the exagge∣rated praise which had been so liberally poured forth on his character; but because the nation was deprived of him at a critical juncture, while in∣volved in a dangerous and expensive war, of which he had been personally the chief mover and sup∣port. They knew the burden of royalty devolved upon a young prince, who, though heir apparent to the crown, and already arrived at the years of maturity, had never been admitted to any share of the administration, nor made acquainted with any schemes or secrets of state. The real character of the new king was very little known to the gene∣rality of the nation. They dreaded an abrupt change of measures, which might have rendered useless all the advantages obtained in the course of the war. As they were ignorant of his connexions, they dreaded a revolution in the ministry, which might fill the kingdom with clamour and confu∣sion. But the greatest shock occasioned by his de∣cease
<PB N="119" REF="1200"/>
was undoubtedly▪ among our allies and fel∣low-subjects<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> in Germany, who saw themselves sud∣denly deprived of their sole prop and patron, at a time when they could not pretend of themselves, to make head against the numerous enemies by whom they were surrounded. But all these doubts and apprehensions vanished like mist before the rising sun; and the people of Great Britain enjoyed the inexpressible pleasure of seeing their loss re∣paired in such a manner, as must have amply ful∣filled the most sanguine wish of every friend to his country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the com∣merce of Great Britain.</NOTE> The commerce of Great Britain continued to increase during the whole course of this reign; but this increase was not the effect of extraordinary encouragement. On the contrary, the necessities of government, the growing expences of the na∣tion, and the continual augmentation of the pub∣lic debt, obliged the legislature to hamper trade with manifold and grievous impositions: its in∣crease, therefore, must have been owing to the na∣tural progress of industry and adventure, extend∣ing themselves to that farthest line or limit be∣yond which they will not be able to advance: when the tide of traffick has flowed to its highest mark, it will then begin to recede in a gradual ebb, until it is shrunk within the narrow limits of its original channel. War, which naturally im∣pedes the traffick of other nations, has opened new sources to the merchants of Great Britain: the superiority of her naval power hath crushed the navigation of France, her great rival in com∣merce; so that she now supplies, on her own
<PB N="120" REF="1210"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> terms, all those foreign markets at which in time of peace she was undersold by that dangerous com∣petitor. Thus her trade is augmented to a sur∣prising pitch; and this great augmentation alone has enabled her to maintain the war at such an enormous expence. As this advantage will cease when the French are at liberty to re-establish their commerce, and prosecute it without molestation, it would be for the interest of Great Britian to be at continual variance with that restless neighbour, provided the contest could be limited to the ope∣rations of a sea-war, in which England would be always invincible and victorious. Foreign nations will doubtless be surprised to learn, that above eight thousand ships are employed by the traders of Great Britain; and that the produce of the sink∣ing fund, which is the overplus produced by all the different funds appropriated to defray the in∣terest of the national debt, exceeds annually three millions sterling.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of religion and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣losophy.</NOTE> The powers of the human mind were freely and fully exercised in this reign. Considerable pro∣gress was made in mathematics and astronomy by divers individuals; among whom we number San∣derson, Bradley, Maclaurin, Smith, and the two Simpsons.</P>
<P>Natural philosophy became a general study, and the new doctrine of electricity grew into fashion. Different methods were discovered for rendering sea-water potable and sweet; and divers useful hints were communicated to the public by the learned doctor Stephen Hale, who directed all his researches and experiments to the benefit of so∣ciety.
<PB N="121" REF="1220"/>
The study of alchemy no longer prevailed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> but the art of chemistry was perfectly understood, and assiduously applied to the purposes of sophisti∣cation.</P>
<P>The clergy of Great Britain were generally learned, pious, and exemplary. Sherlock, Hoad∣ley, Secker, and Conybeare, were promoted to the first dignities of the church. Warburton, who had long signalized himself by the strength and boldness of his genius, his extensive capaci∣ty, and profound erudition, at length obtained the mitre. But these promotions were granted to reasons of state convenience, and personal interest, rather than as rewards of extraordinary merit. Many other ecclesiastics of worth and learning were totally overlooked. Nor was ecclesiastical merit confined to the established church. Many instances of extraordinary genius, unaffected piety, and universal moderation, appeared among the dis∣senting ministers of Great Britain and Ireland: among these we particularlize the elegant, the pri∣mitive Foster; the learned, ingenious, and pene∣trating Leland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fanati∣cism.</NOTE> The progress of reason, and free cultivation of the human mind, had not however entirely ba∣nished those ridiculous sects and schisms of which the kingdom had been formerly so productive. Imposture and fanaticism still hung upon the skirts of religion. Weak minds were seduced by the delusions of a superstition stiled Methodism, raised upon the affectation of superior sanctity, and main∣tained by pretensions to divine illumination. Many thousands in the lower ranks of life were infected
<PB N="122" REF="1230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> with this species of enthusiasm, by the unwearied endeavours of a few obscure preachers; such as Wh—, and the two W—s, who propagated their doctrines to the most remote corners of the British dominions, and found means to lay the whole kingdom under contribution.</P>
<P>Fanaticism also formed a league with false phi∣losophy. One Hutchinson, a visionary, intoxi∣cated with the fumes of Rabbinical learning, pre∣tended to deduce all demonstration from Hebrew roots, and to confine all human knowledge to the five books of Moses. His disciples became nu∣merous after his death. With the methodists, they denied the merit of good works; and bitterly inveighed against Newton as an ignorant preten∣der, who had presumed to set up his own ridi∣culous chimaeras in opposition to the sacred philo∣sophy of the Pentateuch. But the most extraordi∣nary sect which distinguished this reign was that of the Moravians, or Hernhutters, imported from Germany by count Zinzendorf, who might have been termed the Melchizedec of his followers, in∣asmuch as he assumed among them the three-fold character of prophet, priest, and king. They could not be so properly stlled a sect as the disci∣ples of an original, who had invented a new system of religion. Their chief adoration was payed to the Second Person in the Trinity: the First they treated with the most shocking neglect. Some of their tenets were bl—s, some indecent, and others ridiculously absurd. Their discipline was a strange mixture of devotion and impurity. Their exterior worship consisted of hymns, prayers, and
<PB N="123" REF="1240"/>
sermons; the hymns extremely ludicrous, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An, 1760.</NOTE> often indecent, alluding to the side hole or wound which Christ received from a spear in his side, while he remained upon the cross. Their sermons frequently contained very gross incentives to the work of propagation. Their private exercises are said to have abounded with such rites and myste∣ries as we cannot explain, with any regard to deco∣rum. They prosessed a community of goods; and were governed as one family, in temporals as well as spirituals, by a council, or kind of presby∣tery, in which the count, as their ordinary, pre∣sided. In cases of doubt, or great consequence, these pretended to consult the Saviour, and to decide from immediate inspiration; so that they boasted of being under the immediate direction of a Theocracy; though, in fact, they were slaves to the most dangerous kind of despotism: for as often as any individual of the community presumed to think for himself, or differ in opinion from the ordinary and his band of associates, the oracle de∣creed, that he should be instantly sent upon the mission which they had fixed in Greenland, or to the colony they had established in Pensylvania. As the religionists consisted chiefly of manufac∣turers, who appeared very sober, orderly, and in∣dustrious; and their chief declared his intention of prosecuting works of public emolument, they obtained a settlement under a parliamentary sanc∣tion in England, where they soon made a consi∣derable number of proselytes, before their princi∣ples were fully discovered and explained.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Many ingenious treatises on metaphysics and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Metaphy∣sics and Medicine.</NOTE> morality appeared in the course of this reign; and a philosophical spirit of inquiry diffused itself to the furthest extremities of the united kingdom. Tho' few discoveries of importance were made in medicine, yet that art was well understood in all its differ∣ent branches; and many of its professors distin∣guished themselves in other provinces of litera∣ture. Besides the medical essays of London and Edinburgh, the physician's library was enriched with many useful modern productions; with the works of the classical Friend, the elegant Mead, the accurate Huxham, and the philosophical Prin∣gle. The art of midwifery was elucidated by science, reduced to fixed principles, and almost wholly consigned into the hands of men practi∣tioners. The researches of anatomy were prose∣cuted to some curious discoveries by the inge∣nuity and dexterity of a Hunter and a Monro. The numerous hospitals in London contributed to the improvement of surgery, which was brought to perfection under the auspices of a Cheselden and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agricul∣ture.</NOTE> a Sharpe. The advantages of agriculture, which had long flourished in England, extended them∣selves gradually to the most remote and barren provinces of the island.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mecha∣nics.</NOTE> The mechanic powers were well understood, and judiciously applied to many useful machines of necessity and convenience. The mechanical arts had attained to all that perfection which they were capable of acquiring; but the avarice and op∣pression of contractors, obliged the handicraftsman to exert his ingenuity, not in finishing his work
<PB N="125" REF="1260"/>
well, but in affording it cheap; in purchasing<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> bad materials, and performing his task in a hurry; in concealing flaws, substituting shew for solidity, and sacrificing reputation to the thirst of lucre. Thus many of the English manufactures, being found slight and unserviceable, grew into discredit abroad; thus the art of producing them more perfect, may in time be totally lost at home. The cloths now made in England, are inferior in texture and fabric to those which were manufac∣tured in the beginning of the century; and the same judgment may be pronounced upon al∣most every article of hardware. The razors, knives, scissars, hatchets, swords, and other edge utensils, perpared for exportation, are ge∣nerally ill-tempered, half-finished, flawed or brit∣tle; and the musquets, which are sold for seven or eight shillings a-piece to the exporter, so carelesly and unconscientiously prepared, they can∣not be used without imminent danger of mutila∣tion; accordingly one hardly meets with a ne∣gro man upon the coast of Guinea, in the neigh∣bourhood of the British settlements, who has not been wounded or maimed in some member, by the bursting of the English fire-arms. The advantages of this traffic, carried on at the ex∣pence of character and humanity, will naturally cease whenever those Africans can be supplied more honestly by the traders of any other nation.</P>
<P>Genius in writing spontaneously arose, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genius.</NOTE> though neglected by the great, flourished under the culture of a public which had pretensions to taste, and piqued itself on encouraging literary
<PB N="126" REF="1270"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> merit. Swift and Pope we have mentioned on another occasion. Young still survived a vener∣able monument of poetical talent. Thomson, the poet of the Seasons, displayed a luxuriancy of genius in describing the beauties of nature. Aken∣side and Armstrong excelled in didactic poetry. Even the Epopoea did not disdain an English dress, but appeared to advantage in the Leonidas of Glover, and the Epigoniad of Wilkie. The public acknowledged a considerable share of dra∣matic merit in the tragedies of Young, Mallet, Home, and some other less distinguished authors. Very few regular comedies, during this period, were exhibited on the English theatre, which, however, produced many less laboured pieces, abounding with satire, wit, and humour. The Careless Husband of Cibber, and Suspicious Hus∣band of Hoadley, are the only very modern comedies that bid fair for reaching posterity. The exhibitions of the stage were improved to the most exquisite entertainment, by the talents and management of Garrick, who greatly sur∣passed all his predecessors of this, and perhaps every other nation, in his genius for acting; in the sweetness and variety of his tones; the irre∣sistible magic of his eye; the fire and vivacity of his action: the elegance of attitude; and the whole pathos of expression. Quin excelled in dignity and declamation; as well as in exhi∣biting some characters of humour, equally ex∣quisite and peculiar. Cibber breathed the whole soul of female tenderness and passion; and Prit∣chard displayed all the dignity of distress. That
<PB N="127" REF="1280"/>
Great Britain was not barren of poets at this pe∣riod,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> appears from the detached performances of Johnson, Mason, Gray, the two Whiteheads, and the two Wartons, besides a great number of other bards who have sported in lyric poetry, and acquired the applause of their fellow citizens. Candidates for literary fame appeared even in the higher sphere of life, embellished by the ner∣vous stile, superior sense, and extensive erudition of a Corke; by the delicate taste, the polished muse, and tender feelings of a Lyttleton. King shone unrivalled in Roman eloquence. Even the female sex distinguished themselves by their taste and ingenuity. Miss Carter rivalled the cele∣brated Dacier in learning and critical knowledge; and Mrs. Lennox signalized herself by many suc∣cessful efforts of genius, both in poetry and prose. The genius of Cervantes was transfused into the novels of Fielding, who painted the characters, and ridiculed the follies of life with equal strength, humour, and propriety. The field of history and biography was cultivated by many writers of ability, among whom we distinguish the copious Guthrie, the circumstantial Ralph, the laborious Carte, the learned and elegant Robertson, and above all the ingenious, penetrating, and com∣prehensive Hume, whom we rank among the first writers of the age, both as an historian and philoso∣pher. Nor let us forget the merit conspicuous in the works of Campbell, remarkable for candour, intelligence, and precision. Johnson, inferior to none in philosophy, philology, poetry, and clas∣sical learning, stands foremost as an essayist, justly
<PB N="128" REF="1290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> admired for the dignity, strength, and variety of his stile, as well as for the agreeable manner in which he investigates the human heart, tracing every interesting emotion, and opening all the sources of morality. The laudable aim of inlist∣ing the passions on the side of virtue, was suc∣cessfully pursued by Richardson, in his Pamela, Clarissa, and Grandison; a species of writing equal∣ly new and extraordinary, where, mingled with much superfluity and impertinence, we find a su∣blime system of ethics, and amazing knowledge, and command of human nature. Many of the Greek and Roman classics made their appearance in English translations, which were favourably received as works of merit; among these we place, after Pope's Homer, Virgil by Pitt and Warton, Horace by Francis, Polybius by Hamp∣ton, and Sophocles by Francklyn. The war in∣troduced a variety of military treatises, chiefly translated from the French language; and a free country like Great Britain, will always abound with political tracts and lucubrations. Every lite∣rary production of merit, calculated for amuse∣ment or instruction, that appeared in any country or language of Christendom, was immediately imported, and naturalized among the English people. Never was the pursuit after knowledge so universal, literary merit more regarded, than at this juncture by the body of the British nation; but it was honoured by no attention from the throne, and little indulgence did it reap from the liberality of particular patrons. The reign of queen Anne was propitious to the fortunes of
<PB N="129" REF="1300"/>
Swift and Pope, who lived in all the happy pride of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> independence. Young, sequestered from courts and preferment, possesses a moderate benefice in the country, employing his time in a conscientious discharge of his ecclesiastical functions. Thom∣son, with the most benevolent heart that ever warmed the human breast, maintained a perpetual war with the difficulties of a narrow fortune. He enjoyed a place in Chancery by the bounty of lord Talbot, of which he was divested by the succeed∣ing chancellor. He afterwards enjoyed a small pension from Frederick, prince of Wales, which was withdrawn in the sequel. About two years before his death he obtained by the interest of his friend lord L—n, a comfortable place; but he did not live to taste the blessing of easy circum∣stances, and died in debt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However he was ne∣glected when living, his me∣mory has been honoured with peculiar marks of public re∣gard, in an ample subscrip∣tion for a new edition of his works, the profits to be em∣ployed in erecting a monu∣ment to his fame in West∣minster-abbey; a subscription to which his present majesty king George III. has liberal∣ly contributed. The remain∣ing surplus will be distributed among his poor relations; and it must be owned, for the honour of the booksellers, that Mr. Millar has sacri∣ficed his interest, by giv∣ing up the advantages of his copy, for the advance∣ment of such a generous de∣sign.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>None of the rest, whom we have named, en∣joyed any share of the royal bounty, except W. Whitehead, who succeeded to the place of laureat at the death of Cibber; and some of them,
<PB N="130" REF="1310"/>

<P>While the queen lived, some countenance was given to learning. She conversed with Newton, and corresponded with Libnitz. She took pains to acquire popularity: the royal family, on certain days, dined in public for the satisfaction of the people: the court was animated with a freedom of spirit and vivacity, which rendered it at once brilliant and agreeable. At her death that spirit began to languish; and a total stagnation of gaiety and good humour ensued. It was succeeded by a sullen calm, an ungracious reserve, and a still ro∣tation of insipid forms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">George II. by his queen Carolina, had two sons and five daughters, who attained the age of maturity; Fre∣derick prince of Wales, fa∣ther to his present majesty George III.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Music.</NOTE> England was not defective in other arts that embellish and amuse. Music became a fashion∣able study, and its professors generally caressed by the public. An Italian opera was maintained at a great expence, and well supplied with fo∣reign performers. Private concerts were insti∣tuted in every corner of the metropolis. The compositions of Handel were universally admired, and he himself lived in affluence. It must be owned at the same time, that Geminiani was

neglected, though his genius commanded esteem<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> and veneration. Among the few natives of Eng∣land who distinguished themselves by their ta∣lents in this art, Green, Howard, Arne, and Boyce, were the most remarkable.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">painting.</NOTE> The British soil, which had hitherto been bar∣ren in the article of painting, now produced some artists of extraordinary merit. Hogarth excelled all the world in exhibiting the scenes of ordinary life; in humorous historical designs. Hudson, Reynolds, and Ramsay, distinguished themselves by their superior merit in portraits; a branch that was successfully cultivated by many other English painters. Wooton was famous for representing live animals in general; Seymour for race horses; Lambert, and the Smiths, for landschape; and Scot for sea-pieces. Several spirited attempts were made on historical sub∣jects; but little progress was made on the su∣blime parts of painting. Essays of this kind were discouraged by a false taste, founded upon a reprobation of British genius. The art of en∣graving was brought to perfection by Strange, and laudably practised by several other masters; and great improvements were made in mezzo∣tinto, miniature, and enamel. Many fair monu∣ments of sculpture or statuary were raised by Rysbach, Roubilliac, and Wilton. Architecture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">sculpture.</NOTE> which had been cherished by the elegant taste of a Burlington, soon became a favourite study; and many magnificent edifices were reared in different parts of the kingdom. Ornaments were carved in wood, and moulded in stucco,
<PB N="132" REF="1340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> with all the delicacy of execution; but a pas∣sion for novelty had introduced into gardening, building, and furniture, an absurd taste, equally void of beauty and convenience. Improvements in the liberal and useful arts, will doubtless be the consequence of that encouragement given to merit by the society instituted for these pur∣poses, which we have described on another oc∣casion. As for the Royal Society, it seems to have degenerated in its researches, and to have had very little share for half a century at least, in extending the influence of true philosophy.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this reign with a detail of the forces and fleets of Great Britain, from whence the reader will conceive a just idea of her opulence and power.</P>

<P>From the foregoing list of sea and land forces it plainly appears, that Great Britain, on her own element, is more than a match for all the maritime powers of Europe, should they combine to her prejudice. Nothing, therefore, could be more impolitical in the conduct of any neutral state, ambi∣tious of naval commerce, than to involve itself in a war, as the associate or auxiliary to the enemies of England; because it would necessarily forfeit the advantages of neutrality, and, in all human probability, see its infant navigation immediately destroyed. This would certainly be the fate of Spain, should she precipitately espouse the cause of the other branch of the house of Bourbon; for, granting it was in her power to reinforce the French navy with thirty sail of the line, the com∣bined
<PB N="143" REF="1450"/>
fleets would still be unable to dispute the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> empire of the sea, against such a superiority of number as the English could produce; and in the mean time her most important settlements in the West Indies, the source of all her wealth, would be exposed to the efforts of an enterprising foe, accustomed to conquest; while her merchant-ships that cover the ocean, would fall an easy prey to the cruisers of Great Britain.</P>

<P>THE demise of the crown was no sooner sig∣nified<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to the secretaries of state, than Mr. Pitt repaired to Kew, and communicated these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procla∣mation of king George III.</NOTE> tidings to his new sovereign, George III. who thus ascended the throne in the twenty-third year of his age. The lords of the privy council were immediately assembled; and next day his majesty was proclaimed before Saville-house in Leicester-fields, in presence of the great officers of state, the nobility, the lord mayor and aldermen of the city of London, and a great number of persons of the first distinction. The same proclamation was repeated with the usual solemnities in different parts of the metropolis, which resounded with joy and acclamations. To the council, assembled at Carleton▪house, the king addressed himself in these words: <Q>“The loss that I and the nation have sus∣tained by the death of the king my grand∣father, would have been severely felt at any time; but coming at so critical a juncture, and so unexpected, it is by many circumstances aug∣mented; and the weight now falling upon me, much increased, I feel my own ins f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciency to support it as I wish: but, animated by the ten∣derest affection for this my native country, and depending on the advice, experience, and abi∣lities

The two houses of parliament being assembled, the members were sworn in; the peers by the lord keeper; the com∣mons before the duke of Rutland, lord steward: then both houses were adjourned.

<P>His royal highness Edward duke of York, the king's brother, being enrolled a member of the privy council, and John earl of Bute admitted to the same honour, his majesty, by proclamation, required all persons, who were in office of autho∣rity or government at the decease of the late king, to proceed in the execution of their respective offices. Another proclamation was issued for the encouragement of piety and virtue, and for pre∣venting and punishing vice, prophaneness, and im∣morality. The tide of affection towards the young monarch began to run so high, that addresses, couched in the warmest professions of love and at∣tachment, flowed in from every part of the king∣dom.

<P>"Amidst the congratu∣lations that surround the throne, permit me to lay before your majesty a heart, which, though oppressed with age and infirmity, is no stranger to the joys of my country.</P>
<P>When the melancholy news of the late king's demise reached us, it naturally led us to consider the loss we had sustained, and upon what our hopes of futurity depended.

<P>Oh! how graciously did the providence of God provide a successor, able to bear the weight of government in that unexpected event.</P>

Let there be but one contest between them, whether the king loves the people best, or the people him: and may it be a long, a very long contest; may it never be decided, but let it remain doubtful; and may the paternal affection on the one side, and the filial obe∣dience on the other, be had in perpetual remembrance.</P>
<P>This will probably be the last time I shall ever trouble your majesty. I beg leave to express my warmest wishes and prayers on your behalf.

No prince had ever ascended the throne of Great Britain under happier auspices, from the universal consent and approbation of the people, than those which attended the elevation of his present majesty; yet no English prince was ever less known to the subjects whom Providence had decreed he should one day govern. Instead of making himself familiar to the eyes of the public, mingling with society, giving way to the ebulli∣tions of youth, and sometimes countenancing the gayer follies of the age, in imitation of former princes destined to sway the sceptre of England, who thus at once indulged their own passions and acquired popularity; he preserved the laws of tem∣perance and decorum inviolate: he restrained all the inordinate sallies of youth: sequestered from all participation in the measures of government, he lived within the bosom of retirement, surrounded by a few friends and dependants, to whom the virtues of his disposition were known. The think∣ing part of the nation, precluded from this oppor∣tunity of contemplating the true character of their

future sovereign, conceived no sublime idea of ta∣lents<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> which had not yet shone distinguished to the eyes of the public; and consoled themselves with such comfortable presages as they could derive from his good nature and benevolence, which were universally acknowledged. But when he emerged from that obscurity which had shrouded him from the knowledge of his future subjects, and assumed the reins of government he was born to manage, he seemed to have inherited, together with the crown, the talent of wearing it with dignity, and already appeared perfect in the art of reigning. All his deportment displayed the most graceful ease; all his conduct spoke superior sense, serenity, and composure. When the people beheld their amiable sovereign; when they surveyed the ele∣gance of his person, his manly and majestic mien, his open, elevated, and ingenuous countenance, glowing with complacency, sentiment, and huma∣nity; they gazed with all the eagerness of the most loyal affection. But their love was heightened to rapture and admiration, when the excellency of his character unfolded itself more distinctly to their view; when they were made acquainted with the transcendent virtues of his heart, and the uncom∣mon extent of his understanding; when they knew he was mild, affable, social, and sympa∣thizing; susceptible of all the emotions which pri∣vate friendship inspires; kind and generous to his dependents, liberal to merit, with a hand ever open and extended to the children of distress; when they knew his heart was intirely British; warmed with the most cordial love of his native country,

<P>Thus affected, they could not withold their ap∣probation from those who had contributed to ren∣der him so worthy of the throne which he now ascended. Their blessings were liberally poured forth on that excellent princess, who watched over his infancy with all the tenderness of maternal zeal; whose precepts enlightened his morals; whose ex∣ample confirmed his virtue. Their veneration was extended to all those who had so effectually lab ured in his improvement; to the venerable pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Thomas, now bishop of Winchester.</NOTE> who had superintended his education; to the noble<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The earl of Harcourt.</NOTE> lord who had been appointed the governor of his youth.

His inviolable attach∣ment to his sovereign's father was founded on per∣sonal regard, sustained by his love of liberty and independence, which no consideration of interest
<PB N="153" REF="1560"/>
could ever induce him to forego. His affection<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> for the father devolved upon the son, whom he may be said to have cultivated from his cradle. He concurred in forming his young mind to vir∣tue; in storing it with ideas and sentiment suitable to his birth and expectation; in improving his taste, and directing his pursuit of knowledge. He was the constant companion of his solitude, whom he honoured with his friendship; the bosom counsel∣lor, on whose judgment and fidelity he with the most perfect confidence reposed. These connec∣tions being considered, the earl of Bute could not fail of being admitted to a share in the administra∣tion when his master ascended the throne; and this was a circumstance not at all disagreeable to the former minister, with whom he had lived on terms of friendly communication.</P>
<P>How much soever the king might have disap∣proved of those measures which had involved the nation in such an expensive war on the continent of Europe, affairs were so situated, that he could not abruptly renounce that system of politics, with any regard to the dignity of his crown, or to the honour of the public faith, which was in some measure engaged to support the German allies of Great Britain. With the crown he inherited a war, which he thought it his duty to prosecute with vigour, until it could be terminated by a general peace, in which the honour and advantage of the nation might be equally consulted. It was there∣fore agreed, in an extraordinary council assembled on purpose, that the armament at Portsmouth should proceed on the expedition for which it was
<PB N="154" REF="1570"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> originally intended; but it was countermanded in the sequel. Mean while the king exhibited other agreeable specimens of his disposition, by doing justice to certain individuals who had suffered in the former reign, for having acted according to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merit pa∣tronized.</NOTE> dictates of conscience and honour; by inviting to his councils the wise and virtuous of all denomina∣tions; by opening his royal arms to embrace all his people, without distinction of party: by fa∣vouring merit with his peculiar protection; by extending his notice and his royal bounty, unsoli∣cited, even to genius sequestered in the shade of obscurity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral of the late king.</NOTE> On the tenth day of November, in the evening, the body of the late king was removed from Ken∣sington to the apartment called the Prince's cham∣ber, near the house of peers, where it lay in state unt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l next night, when it was interred with great funeral pomp in the royal vault in the chapel of Henry VII. adjoining to Westminster-abbey, the duke of Cumberland appearing in the character of chief mourner. These last duties to the deceased monarch being piously discharged, the eyes of the nation were turned upon their youthful sovereign, and the majority seemed equally to wish and to hope that a new system of politics would be em∣braced. They could not reflect without regret, that notwithstanding the prodigious sum of eigh∣teen millions sterling, granted in the last session of pa liament for the prosecution of the war, not one expedition was carried into action upon the British element for the annoyance of the enemy; for, as to the reduction of Canada, it was the necessary

consequence of those conquests made, and those<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> measures taken, in the course of the preceding year. They reflected that a great number of ca∣pital ships lay inactive in the different harbours of Great Britain, while the French privateers insulted the Channel, disturbing the commerce of Eng∣land; and that an armament equipped at a mon∣strous expence, and seemingly sufficient to reduce all the remaining French settlements in the West Indian islands, was detained in idle suspence at Spithead, until the season for action was entirely elapsed. They saw, with concern, that the eyes and efforts of the ad—n were more and more directed to the operations in Westphalia and Saxo∣ny; and, indeed, their perception, in this respect, was considerably assisted by a performance pub∣lished at this juncture, under the the title of "Consi∣derations on the present German War," a per∣formance fraught with such perspicuity, candour, and precision, as could not fail to operate very powerfully on the conviction of the public, which accordingly, thus aroused, seemed to wake at once from an inconsistent dream of prejudice and infa∣tuation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflec∣tions upon the war in Germa∣ny.</NOTE> As the sentiments of the author are exactly conformable to our own, and the subject of his enquiry extremely interesting to every honest Bri∣ton, we shall present the reader with a series of his chief arguments and positions, which will be found little more than a recapitulation of the remarks and reflections disseminated through the course of this history. He prefixes to his work, by way of advertisement, the rescript to a manifesto of the
<PB N="156" REF="1590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Prussian monarch, delivered and printed by his mi∣nister at London during the late war, importing, That as no German prince has a right to meddle with the internal policy of Great Britain, nor with the constitution of its government, he had reason to hope the English nation would not meddle with the domestic affairs of the empire; more especially as England had no reason to interfere in this quar∣rel from any consideration of commerce, or other∣wise: and granting that England should be more favourably inclined towards one German court than to another, yet he thought it too unreasonable to pretend that such powerful and respectable princes, as those of the empire are, should be obliged to regulate their conduct according to the inclinations of those among the English, who strive to involve their countrymen in foreign quarrels, that are of no manner of concern to England. He begins with a comparative view of the strength of France and England; and undeniably proves, that France is by far the most powerful in the number of men, in the greatness of revenue, and the variety of re∣sources: every measure, therefore, which has a tendency to unite the powers of Europe, among themselves, and against France, must be for the general advantage of Europe, and the particular interest of Great Britain; and every measure tend∣ing to set the states of Germany, Holland, and England, either at war with each other, or among themselves, must be calculated for the advantage of France, and the prejudice of the other Eu∣ropean powers. Of consequence, whenever such wars shall break out between any two states of Eu∣rope,
<PB N="157" REF="1600"/>
or any two princes of the empire, it will be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760▪</NOTE> the policy of France to encourage and inflame the conquest, as it will be the interest of every other state to compose these differences. He observes, that when France interferes in the quarrels of the empire, should England or Holland espouse the opposite cause, such an interposition could only serve to extend and multiply the evil, and conse∣quently to weaken the power of the empire: that nothing but a hearty union of the emperor and the several states which compose the empire, acting under one head, can either weaken France, or serve the general interest of Europe: that Eng∣land, so long as it continues neuter in disputes be∣tween any two states of Germany, will always be courted by both parties, and generally be able to mediate a pacification; but this importance imme∣diately vanishes, the moment she commences a party: that if the French will promote dissentions among the German princes, and these last become the dupes of such policy, Great Britain is surely not answerable for the consequences: that the powers of the empire, when united are sufficient of themselves to repel every invasion: if, there∣fore, they have so little affection for their country as to call in foreign troops to oppress it, the Eng∣lish can never be bound by any obligation to rescue it from oppression; and nothing can be more ab∣surd than to suppose that Great Britain should con∣stitute itself the general knight-errant of Europe, exhaust itself, and neglect its own wars, in order to save men, in spite of themselves, who will not take any step towards their own preservation. He
<PB N="158" REF="1610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> then proceeds to demonstrate the folly of supposing the protestant interest is in danger: he reminds us, that in the last war the pretended champion of Protestantism was universally decried, by the sub∣jects of this kingdom, as a man void of faith, re∣ligion, and every good principle; and that Great Britain was then strongly connected with the house of Austria, the head of the popish interest in Ger∣many; yet the other religion was never supposed to be in the smallest jeopardy; that no popish power since that period had attempted to infringe the religious liberties of any protestant state; nor had any innovation been made in the empire, to the prejudice of that persuasion, except by the k—of P—a himself, who had built a popish church in his capital, and caused the foundation to be laid in his own name; a favour towards the Catholicks, for which the pope wrote him a letter of thanks and acknowledgement: that as many pro∣testant states have declared against him as he can number among his allies; the Swedes and Saxons, the troops of Mecklenbourg and Wirtemberg, the Palatines, Bohemians, and Hungarians, being ac∣tually at open variance with this protestant hero; while the Dutch and Danes keep aloof with such indifference, as plainly proves they do not appre∣hend their religion is at all endangered: that no protestant power in Europe will thank England for what she has done in the empire; nor will any Ger∣man protestant state act in concert with her, ex∣cept those only which she has bought, and taken into her pay: that this supposed protestant cham∣pion commenced his operations by invading and
<PB N="159" REF="1620"/>
taking possession of the first protestant state of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> empire; and that though the minister of England accompanied him in this expedition, the minister of Hanover disowned him at the diet of Ratisbon, and even declared his master's detestation of such proceedings: that neither a Gregory nor a Ferdi∣nand could have wished for any greater disaster to the protestants, than that Saxony, where the refor∣mation began, should be ravaged with all the cruelty of war, its country wasted, its cities ruined, their suburbs burned, its princes and nobles driven into banishment, its merchants beggared; its pea∣sants forced into arms, compelled to sheath their swords in the bowels of their countrymen, allies, neighbours, and fellow-protestants of Silesia, Hungary, and Bohemia; or obliged to take re∣fuge in the service of France, to fight under popish banners against the protestants of Hanover and Great Britain. To those who plead the necessity of preventing France from making a conquest of Hanover he replies that an electorate of the em∣pire cannot be annihilated but by the destruction of the whole Germanic constitution; and should a king of France seize Hanover, and eject a whole family from its rights, every member of the em∣pire, even Sweden and Denmark, would take the alarm, and rise up against such an act of violence: it were therefore to be wished, that France should attempt to hold such a precarious conquest, that all Germany might be united against her encroaching power. Besides, were it possible that the empire could tamely behold France in possession of a Ger∣man electorate, it would hardly quit the cost of
<PB N="160" REF="1630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> maintaining troops to defend it; or should the French, contrary to all their usual maxims of po∣licy, oppress and pillage these conquered domi∣nions, the English might have reason to sympa∣thize with their fellow-subjects in distress; but surely they could have no reason to expend per∣haps twelve millions of their own, in fruitless en∣deavours to save the Hanoverians a twentieth part of that sum, which is more than they could possibly lose, were the French in possession of their coun∣try: a truth ascertained by experiment, inas∣much as they actually were possessed of the whole electorate, and, exclusive of outrages committed by a rapacious general, whose conduct was con∣demned by his sovereign, they contented them∣selves with the usual taxes and revenue; though this was no more than a temporary possession, at which the other states of the empire connived, be∣cause the Hanoverians had rendered themselves obnoxious to the rest of the Germans by their union with the k—of P—a, who had twice set all Germany in a flame, ravaged the richest parts of the empire, and sacrificed his own subjects, as well as those of other states, by thousands to his ambition. He observed, that the landgraviate of Hesse, the finest country in the north of Germany, was every year occupied by French armies; and the landgrave thought himself fully compensated for the damage it might sustain from their invasion by an English subsidy of three hundred and forty thousand pounds, in consideration of which he permitted his troops to serve in the army of Great Britain: if this was not deemed a full compensa∣tion,
<PB N="161" REF="1640"/>
he might have enjoyed the benefit of a neu¦trality.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> He affirmed, it was not with a view to oppress the Hanoverians that the French pene∣trated into Westphalia; but because they knew the English would meet them there, and fight them at such a disadvantage as might ballance all the success of the British arms in every other part of the world. The French have no other country in which they can act against the power of Eng∣land. They cannot invade Great Britain: if they could, not a regiment would be sent into West∣phalia. They have neither transports to convey, nor a navy to protect their troops in the passage to any part of America, Africa, or the East Indies: they must therefore either remain at home unem∣ployed, or be sent into Germany; and surely while they are prevented from invading the British dominions, and all their islands in the West Indies lie exposed to the attempts of the English, they could not wish for a more effectual diversion than that of transferring the war into Germany, where the utmost endeavours of the British nation serve only to entail misery on that electorate which it at∣tempts to defend; and to exhaust those treasures, which, if applied to the purposes of a truly British war, would infallibly complete the conquest of every settlement possessed by France in America; consequently cut off that ambitious power from the chief source of its wealth and commerce. He demonstrated, that the English, instead of protect∣ing the Hanoverians, had reduced them to the brink of ruin, by making their country the seat of war; and that there would be no end to the mise∣ries
<PB N="162" REF="1650"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> of that unhappy people, if the Englishg—t, out of meer tenderness to their fellow-s;ubjects, should thus bring their own enemies into the country of Hanover, and make the bark of the electerate rue the smart of every quarrel which may happen to arise between Britain and any other power on the continent of Europe. He then con∣siders the nature of the connexion subsisting be∣tween England and the k—of P—; and does not scruple to assert the English are tributaries to that monarch. He says a subsidy is an honourable pension given by one state to another, in considera∣tion of services done, or benefits to be received. What England had agreed to pay to Russia would have been a subsidy, because, in consideration of a certain stipulated sum, the czarina obliged herself to furni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h an army of fifty-five thousand men for the use of his Britannic majesty: the money payed to the landgrave of Hesse Cassel is a subsidy, be∣cause his country lies exposed as a frontier to Ha∣nover, and his troops actually serve in the army of Great Britain; but the k—of P—has done nothing for the immense sums received from Eng∣land, except having invaded, seized, and oppressed a protestant electorate; lighted up a civil war in Germany, which hath been fed with the lives of above one hundred thousand protestants; involved Great Britain in a quarrel with the head and diet of the empire; compelled the queen of Hungary to unite with France, and, by ceding Nieuport and Ostend to that rapacious power, give up in a great measure the advantages of the Barrier Trea∣ty, which England gained at a prodigious expence
<PB N="163" REF="1660"/>
of blood and treasure. In the war of queen Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the k—of P—, for a subsidy of fifty thousand pounds, furnished a considerable body of troops to oppose the French in Savoy. In the present war, the k—of P—a receives an annual payment of above thirteen times that sum, without supplying so many regiments; a sum exceeding the whole amount of the subsidies granted in queen Anne's war to all her German allies put together; and this sum given to a prince who does not even oblige himself to yield any specific assistance in return. Far from sending troops to protect Hanover, he, after the satification of the first treaty, withdrew his garrison from Wesel, of which the French took immediate possession. The sum given, therefore, seems calculated not to secure his aid, but to pur∣chase his forbearance; and this is strictly the de∣finition of a tribute.</P>
<P>Having shewn the absurdity of supposing that Great Britain was obliged, either by promise or treaty, to prosecute measures so pernicious to her allies, and destructive to her own interest, he adduces many arguments to prove that Eng∣land's persisting to carry on the war in Germa∣ny is in itself rainous, and will be found im∣practicable. He observes, that in this war Britain stands single, and alone, to contend with France by land, where it is impossible she should be a match for her antagonist. It was, during the last session of parliament, declared in the house of commons, by a member, who, from the nature of his office, ought to understand the subject, that the standing revenue of France amounted to twelve millions, five of these being anticipated, and the remaining
<PB N="164" REF="1670"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> subject to any deficiencies in the other five: besides, the state has borrowed two millions; so that their whole fund for carrying on the war is equal to nine millions sterling. The standing re∣venue of England, consisting of the land and malt taxes, amounts to two millions seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds; to which may be added a million and a half from the sinking fund, and these sums will constitute four millions. Over and above this revenue, the state hath borrowed twelve mil∣lions for the service of the year. Let the same plan be pursued two years longer, France will owe six millions, and England thirty-six. The English navy for this year, costs five millions six hundred thousand pounds, though never employed in any actual service: France equipped no fleet during the course of this year; so that the difference of expence, in this particular, reduces the funds of the two nations, with respect to the land war, to nine and ten millions. If we consider the ex∣pence of transporting men and horses from Eng∣land to Germany, the fleet of transports to be kept in readiness for all cases of emergency, the difference between French and English pay, the facility which the French have in recruiting and maintaining their forces; we must allow, that their nine millions are more than equal to Eng∣land's ten; and that, on the present plan of the war, their ordinary revenue of seven millions will enable them to bring a greater number of men into the field, without borrowing at all, than Great Bri∣tain can afford, by running every year eight mil∣lions in debt. He takes notice, that a war of de∣fence

is much more difficult than a war of offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> because it is almost impossible to defend a large extent of country from an enterprising enemy of superior number: that the French have every year brought a superiority of number into the field, and every summer penetrated into Hesse and part of Hanover: that whatever force England may send into Germany, France will always send a greater, because her troops are much more numerous: that while England, by running yearly ten or twelve millions in debt, is barely able to maintain an army of ninety-five thousand men in Germany, France, with very little addition to her ordinary expence, can pour one hundred and twenty thousand men into the same country; consequently may protract the war until the credit of Britain shall be entirely bankrupt, as it is prosecuted in a country where victory can do the English little good, and where a defeat can do the French little harm. Should they lose one battle, instead of maintaining their ground on the Weser, they will retreat to the Mayne; that is, to a greater distance from Eng∣land, and so much nearer to their own country. Should the British army obtain a second victory, perhaps their enemies might repass the Rhine into France, where surely the English would not be so mad as to follow them, or undertake the reduction of their fortified frontier: they would therefore be recruited and reinforced, and return in the next campaign with superior numbers: but should the fate of battle turn against the British arms, they would be obliged to retreat until cut off from all communication with the sea; and, as they could
<PB N="166" REF="1690"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> neither be recruited nor reinforced, must at the long▪run submit to a capitulation. With respect to the loss of men, France never maintained a more innocent war; and all the advantages gained over them in Germany have served only to prevent their reduction of Hanover; but no decisive stroke hath been struck against them: for, though they have retreated for the present, they have returned every succeeding campaign with redoubled vigour. What purpose, therefore, can be answered by the prosecution of such a war, but the devastation of the territories belonging to the British allies, the accumulation of an enormous debt on the shoulders of Great Britain and a deplorable slaughter of her bravest sons, whose lives have been squandered away with the most savage profusion, under the direction of a foreigner, whom England could not punish, nor call to account, even though he had (which surely is not the case) made the most infamous use of the power and authority with which he was vested? Should Britain, by an ex∣traordinary effort, and contracting an additional debt of twenty millions, be able to send a superior force into Germany, while the French are retired into their own country, this would undoubtedly be the consequence: the enemy would remain at home for that year, and, by saving their troops and their money, provide a better fund for the ensu∣ing campaign, when England would be exhausted. At this rate, whatever the success of England may be in Germany, France can never be effectually injured by them: on the contrary, it will be her interest to keep alive the war in that quarter, as the
<PB N="167" REF="1700"/>
most effectual and infallible means of weakening<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the sinews of her great rival.</P>
<P>After having fatther discussed the merits of his P—n m—y, respecting Great Britain, deduced from his conduct towards her, both in the past and present war, the author proceeds to investigate that great political question, whether Britain ought to have any continental connections? He determines in the affirmative. He observes, that France is the only enemy upon the continent by which Britain can be endangered; and allows, that whenever the other nations of Europe will unite effectually in a war against France, it will then be the interest of England to join in that alliance; but to interfere as a party, or rather as an incendiary, in every quarrel between German princes, to take up the cudgels herself, and contract enormous debts by borrowing money to pay them for fighting their own quarrels, is such an absurdity in politics as one would think no nation could avow. He says, if king William III. instead of placing himself at the head of Eu∣rope, and uniting the several states of it in arms against France, had constituted himself the chief of a German party, formed petty connections in that country, and involved Great Britain in the in∣ternal broils of the empire, the French monarch might have thanked him for adhering to such a wretched system, which no other power of Europe would have joined him in supporting. All the treasures of England, in that case, had been ex∣pended to no purpose; and in the mean time Eu∣rope would have been enslaved. A clamour was raised against that prince, charging him with

The French were op∣posed by different armies of the allies in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Savoy, Germany, and Flanders: they lost twenty thousand men at the battle of Ra∣millies; and a whole army, with half a million of treasure, at the siege and battle of Turin. For this expence of about two million eight hundred thou∣sand pounds, advanced by England, the allies were induced to bring two hundred thousand men into the field: but England has this year expended more than double that sum in Germany, without being able to produce half the number.</P>
<P>Our sensible author, in the next place, considers that maxim which has been so strongly inculcated on the public; namely, that the war in Germany is a diversion in favour of the English. He denies that it is a diversion either of the forces, or of the treasures of France. The French forces are em∣ployed in a German war; but by no means di∣verted from any other service by which they could
<PB N="170" REF="1730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> annoy the English. They may assemble troops on the coast opposite to England; but they have neither ships to transport them, nor a fleet to pro∣tect them in their passage. Could they find means to throw over ten thousand men by stealth, or even double that number, what reason could Britain have to fear such an invasion▪ were those national troops, which she now maintains in Germany, to the amount of five and twenty thousand men, en∣camped or cantoned on the southern coast of Eng∣land, ready to be reinforced by the rest of the re∣gular forces and the militia of Great Britain? Could such a descent be effected in spite of all the diffi∣culties attending it, which appear almost insur∣mountable while the English are masters at sea; the invaders must infallibly be defeated, and even obliged to surrender at discretion: but, granting such an attempt was practicable, it would not surely be prevented by their prosecuting the war in Germany.</P>
<P>The army of France in time of war does not fall short of three hundred thousand men. About one hundred and twenty thousand are employed in Germany: they have no other enemy to oppose on the continent of Europe; consequently one hundred and eighty thousand men remain inac∣tive, and one half of these idle men would be more than sufficient to invade Great Britain with a good prospect of success: they are not there∣fore in want of troops; but destitute of the means of conveyance; an undeniable proof that a German war is not a diversion of the French forces. Neither can it be deemed a division of
<PB N="171" REF="1740"/>
their treasure; because their treasure could not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> be employed so effectually elsewhere in the annoy∣ance of Great Britain. They were very sensible of the advantages they derived from their colo∣nies in the East and West Indies, and justly con∣sidered them as the great source of their wealth, and the chief support of their marine. They knew that these settlements could not be protected against England, without a formidable fleet and a great number of transports, to wast over occasional succours and supplies. If we, therefore, suppose the French ministry governed by the dictates of true policy, or indeed of common sense, they would have converted their treasure and their whole endeavours to this, as the most important object that could engage their attention, had they not found the task altogether impracticable. Their ships were detained in English ports; their sailors in English prisons. Their fishery was destroyed; their navigation at an end; and all their principal harbours, both in Europe and America, were blocked up by the squadrons of Great Britain. They might perhaps purchase ships from the Swedes, Danes, or Genoese; but as the sea is covered with Eng∣lish cruisers, and their ports are beset by the squa∣drons of this nation, they would find it a very dif∣ficult task to assemble a navy; and should they succeed in this particular, their ships must rot in the harbour; for ships can be of no service with∣out seamen; and seamen cannot be made but by the practice of navigation. In the beginning of the war, while there was any possibility of support∣ing their marine, they attended to this object with
<PB N="172" REF="1750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the most assiduous care; and while there was any reasonable prospect of invading England, never dreamed of marching into Germany. The elec∣torate of Hanover was so far from being thought in danger, that a body of its troops were brought over for the defence of England. In the sequel, when France perceived that Britain was prepared against insult; that her own navy was destroyed, and her colonies in danger of being conquered; then she bethought herself of Germany; and it was she in fact that made the diversion, in this country; and the German war was, on the part of England, not a war of diversion, but a war of defence, in favour of a barren electorate, which, if put up to sale, would not fetch one half of the money which is yearly expended in its behalf; for the protection of a country which cannot be pro∣tected, whose inhabitants are rendered mise∣rable by the assistance which they receive; and for the support of an ally from whom no mutual service can be expected. On the other hand, had one third part of the sums expended in Germany, been employed in giving additional vigour to the naval armaments of Great Britain, France by this time would not have had one settlement left in the West Indies: all the profits of her external com∣merce must have ceased, and she must have been absolutely obliged to accept such terms of peace as England should think proper to impose. Nay, without any such additional reinforcement, this consequence must have ensued from a spirited use of that armament which loitered inactive at Ports∣mouth, until the season for action was elapsed.
<PB N="173" REF="1760"/>
Should Britain persist in throwing her ineffectual<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> shield before Hanover, it will be the signal for France to make that electorate the seat of war in every future quarrel. It will be giving up all the advantages of an insular situation, and, as it were, chaining Great Britain to the continent, from which she is so happily severed by nature. It is re∣nouncing her naval superiority, and leaving her enemy the choice of a field where discomfiture can do them little harm, and where she herself must be infallibly exhausted, even by a succession of her own victories. Three such victories as those of Crevelt, Minden, and Warbourg, though obtained in the course of one campaign, could have little or no effect in bringing the war to a termination. The French army would retire to their own terri∣tories, and be ready to invade the electorate early in the next campaign. If France, therefore, can maintain the war for little more than the amount of its annual revenue, it can hardly be expected that she will sue for peace these ten years; before the expiration of which period the national debt of Great Britain will exceed two hundred millions, should it continue to encrease eight millions annual∣ly. This we conceive to be a very moderate calcula∣tion, considering that above fourteen millions were borrowed for the service of the present year; and certainly it must afford very melancholy reflections to every lover of his country, who considers that the British manufactures cannot possibly bear the load of such an augmented interest; and that na∣tional bankruptcy must be productive of horror, confusion, anarchy, and ruin.</P>

<P>The king, in passing from the palace of St. James's to St. Stephen's chapel, was saluted by in∣numerable crowds of people, who rent the air with acclamation, and seemed to be transported to a very unusual pitch of loyalty and affection; and those who saw what passed in the house of peers were deeply affected with the scene. Their ears had been long accustomed to foreign accents from the throne; a circumstance at all times ungracious to an English ear: they could not therefore unmoved behold it filled with an amiable prince, born and educated among them, with an open ingenuous countenance, expressing sentiment and benevo∣lence; but when they heard him declare himself a Briton, in the warmest terms of self-gratulation; when they heard him pronounce his oration in a clear melodious tone of voice, with all the graces of elocution, they could not help thinking them∣selves under the illusion of an agreeable dream: they were hurried back, in idea, to the favourite aeras of their admired Edwards and Henrys; and many were melted into tears of tenderness and joy. These raptures, howsoever general and interesting, did not hinder some individuals from regretting certain expressions contained in this popular ha∣rangue: they took exceptions to the declared in∣tention of supporting a continental war; and were sorry to hear the hackneyed pretence of the pro∣testant interest repeated by a prince, who had so little occasion to use any disputable plea with a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> people by whom he was so warmly beloved: but this they imputed to the force of habit in certain counsellors, who had adopted these maxims of state-policy under the auspices and example of a former administration.</P>
<P>In the beginning of every new reign all the members of both houses being obliged by law to take the oaths again, this ceremony was performed in both houses, according to the usual form, as soon as the king retired: then each prepared an address, replete with the most endearing expres∣sions of loyalty and affection, and reverberating every paragraph as it proceeded from the throne. As the substance of both was similar, or rather the same, it will be sufficient to repeat the address of the commons, which ran in the following strain.</P>
<P>"Most gracious sovereign,</P>

<P><Q>“Your majesty's faithful commons approach your royal person with hearts penetrated by the warmest and liveliest sense of your unbounded tenderness and concern for the welfare of your people; and rejoicing at the high satisfaction your majesty takes in the union which so uni∣versally prevails throughout your kingdoms: a deep sense of that national strength and prospe∣rity visibly derived from this salutary source, and above all, your majesty's approbation of that happy union, and the natural disposition and wish of your royal heart to cement and pro∣mote it; are the strongest incentives to con∣cord, and the surest pledge of its duration. The fixt resolution, which your majesty has de∣clared, to countenance and encourage the prac∣tice of true religion and virtue, will, we doubt not, prove the best means of drawing down the favour of God upon a dutiful and united nation: and we shall never cease devoutly to offer up our ardent vows to the Divine Providence, that, as a recompence for these royal virtues, your ma∣jesty may reign in the hearts of a free and happy people; and that they, excited by your ma∣jesty's benevolent care to discharge your royal function, and animated by gratitude for the enjoyment of so many blessings, may make the due return, by a constant obedience to your

<P>The commons, not content with this manifesta∣tion of their love and attachment, agreed to a se∣cond address of thanks for the gracious manner in which the first had been received by his majesty. Even before they had established the orders and resolutions renewed at the beginning of every ses∣sion, they proceeded to take this speech into consi∣deration. A motion being made that a supply<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grant of the civil list.</NOTE> should be granted to his majesty, the house re∣solved itself into a committee, agreed to the mo∣tion, and immediately established the committee of supply, which was continued to the sixth day of March. It was in pursuance of their resolutions, that the commons of England granted for the sup∣port of his majesty's houshold, and of the honour and dignity of the crown, during his life, such a revenue as, together with the annuities payable by virtue of any acts of parliament made in the reign of the late king, out of the hereditary civil list revenues, should amount to the clear yearly sum of eight hundred thousand pounds, to com∣mence from the demise of his late majesty; to be charged upon, and made payable out of the aggregate fund. At the same time they resolved, that the several revenues payable to his late ma∣jesty, during his life, which continued to the time of his demise (other than such payments as were charged upon, and issuing out of the aggregate fund) should be granted and continued from the time of the said demise, to his present majesty dur∣ing

All these supplies were granted before Christmas, within one month after the first estimates were laid be∣fore the house; a circumstance which denotes the accuracy and precision with which the public ac∣counts are exhibited; for we cannot suppose that the representatives of the people would agree to any demands made by the ministers of the crown, until they had strictly examined every article of the estimate or account, upon which the demand was founded.</P>

They allowed fifteen thousand pounds for defray∣ing the charges of the king's mints, and the coinage of gold and silver monies, and other incidental charges; and thereby to encourage the bringing in of gold and silver to be coined, a revenue, not exceeding fifteen thousand pounds per annum, was settled and secured for seven years, commencing at the first day of next March.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti∣ons on the sup∣ply.</NOTE> A man who reflects upon the vast disproportion between the sums now allotted for the annual ser∣vice of the nation, and those supplies which were granted in the beginning of the century, for the maintenance of an extensive and successful war;
<PB N="198" REF="2010"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> when he compares the operations of these two wars, and considers that the pay and subsistence of armies and fleets was the same in both; when he sees how little the value of money is changed in the course of fifty years, and finds the supply of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-one, considerably more than three times as much as was ever granted in the reign of queen Anne, when half the potentates of Europe received sub∣sidies from Great Britain; in revolving these cir∣cumstances, he would find it impossible to account for the difference, without detracting in his own mind from the integrity, wisdom, or oeconomy of the ad—n. It would, therefore, become the guardians of the constitution to appoint a select committee, in the beginning of every session, to examine carefully the separate articles of the pub∣lic accounts, in which it is very certain a thousand frauds may be concealed by the artifices of clerks and agents, actuated by undue influence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Establish∣ment of the civil list.</NOTE> In the beginning of the session, before the com∣mittee had taken the civil list into consideration, the king sent a message by the chancellor of the Exchequer, informing the house of commons, that, being ever ready and desirous to give the most substantial proofs of his tender regard to the welfare of his people, he was willing, that when∣ever the house should enter upon the consideration of making provision for the support of his house∣hold, and of the honour and dignity of the crown, such disposition might be made of his majesty's interest in the hereditary revenues of the crown, as might best conduce to the utility and satisfaction
<PB N="199" REF="2020"/>
of the public. By the accounts laid before the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> house it appeared, that for the last thirty-three years the funds appropriated for raising the civil list re∣venue, had, on the whole, fallen short of pro∣ducing the annual sum of eight hundred thousand pounds: a circumstance the more surprising, as the civil list revenue, immediately before the Union, produced at the rate of six hundred ninety one thousand two hundred and four pounds; and those revenues have been greatly increased since the union of the two kingdoms; for the new subsidy of tonnage and poundage, which is one of the chief branches of the civil list fund, as well as the hereditary and temporary excise, which is an∣other, must have been considerably increased since the Union, by the consumption of East India and other goods in Scotland, which are always entered, and pay the new subsidy in England, as well as by the expence incurred by great numbers of the Scottish nobility and gentry who reside in Eng∣land. At the accession of king George I. there∣fore, the civil list revenues must have produced a great deal more than seven hundred thousand pounds per annum; and to this was added a cer∣tain and clear revenue of one hundred twenty thousand pounds per annum out of the aggregate fund: which addition having been continued during the whole succeeding reign, the civil list revenues, thus augmented, must either have con∣siderably exceeded the annual sum of eight hun∣dred thousand pounds, or been greatly misma∣naged in the collection. Be that as it may, the king now willingly accepted a certain provision of
<PB N="200" REF="2030"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> eight hundred thousand pounds per annum, set∣tled by act of parliament, in lieu of the former funds appropriated for the civil list revenue; and this consent was undoubtedly an instance of royal moderation, considering that this annuity is charged with fifty thousand pounds a year to his mother the princess dowager of Wales, fifteen thousand pounds per annum to the duke of Cum∣berland, and twelve thousand to the princess Ame∣lia. After these deductions, his majesty touches no more than seven hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds annually, for the support of his royal state, the subsistence of all his brothers and sisters, and the maintenance of that progeny which it is to be hoped will be the fruit of his mar∣riage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The bills founded on the resolutions of the committee of ways and means were regularly in∣troduced, and passed into laws, according to the usual form, without any opposition or debate; for the whole house seemed to be actuated by the same spirit of loyalty and condescension. The navy bill and the mutlny bill underwent the annual discus∣sion as usual; and the provisions in this last, re∣lating to the trial and punishment for mutiny and desertion of officers and soldiers in the service of the East India company, were by a new bill ex∣tended to the company's settlement of Fort Marl∣borough, and to such other principal settlements, wherein the company might be hereafter impow∣ered to hold courts of judicature. Among other regulations, they protracted the law intitled "An act to continue, for a limited time, the importation
<PB N="201" REF="2040"/>
of selted beef, pork, and butter from Ireland;"<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> because it was found conducive to the interest of Great Britain. In consequence of a message from the king, acquainting them that the South Sea company had intreated his majesty to become their governor, that he had complied with their request, and now desired the commons would consider of proper methods to render his compliance effectual, they passed a bill for that purpose, and it was en∣acted into a law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petitions from con∣fined deb∣tors.</NOTE> As the accession of a new king to the throne of Great Britain has been generally distinguished by acts of grace in favour of debtors and delinquents, petitions were now presented to the house of com∣mons by persons confined for debt in the different gaols of London, the borough of Southwark, and other parts of the kingdom, explaining their mi∣serable situation, and imploring relief from the le∣gislature. An act in behalf of these objects had generally passed in the first session of every parlia∣ment; but they were now encouraged to hope for immediate relief, not only from the elevation and character of the new sovereign, but also from these other considerations; that all the prisons in the kingdom were crouded; and many thousands of useful subjects lost to their country, at a time when the people were thinned by a cruel sanguinary war; and many branches of manufacture abandoned for want of labourers. The universal benevolence of the young monarch had even diffused a dawn of hope to those objects distinguished by the term of crown-prisoners, of all other captives the most wretched and forlorn; inasmuch as they are in∣dulged

The same hope was extended to those unfortunate outlaws who were exiled from their country, for having obeyed the dictates of what they conceived to be their indis∣pensible duty, and embraced ruin in their endea∣vours to support a family which Providence seems to have devoted to destruction. All these fond il∣lusions, however, vanished in disappointment and despair. By pardoning atrocious crimes, a monarch certainly injures the community he was born to protect. But an act of grace, framed under pro∣per exceptions and restrictions, would undoubted∣ly be an exertion of the royal prerogative, in which the generosity of the prince might happily coincide with the advantage of the people.</P>
<P>To the cries of the debtors the legislature lent a favourable ear, and a bill in their behalf was brought into the house of commons. While they deliberated on this measure, an humble remon∣strance was offered by the bankrupts confined within the prison of the King's Bench, represent∣ing the hardships to which they were exposed from a clause in the bill now depending, by which those unfortunate bankrupts, who had not obtained their certificates, would be excluded from the benefit of the act; and expressing their hope, that, as the legislature had hitherto judged other insolvents to be proper objects of favour, they should be no longer debarred the benefit of that mercy which their fellow-sufferers enjoyed. Little attention, however, was payed to this request; though we
<PB N="203" REF="2060"/>
cannot see any good reason to distinguish, in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> distribution of mercy, between a bankrupt, who has honestly conformed to the statute, and any other kind of insolvent debtor. The bill, which was now passed into an act for the relief of these prisoners, contained a clause which indeed operates as a perpetual indulgence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the present insolvent act, no prisoner can take the benefit of it, that was not actually in custody before the 25th of October last; but those who were arrested be∣fore the said 25th of October, and surrendered themselves before the 28th of Nov. last, may receive the benefit of this: also debtors who were beyond the seas on the same 25th of October, surrender∣ing themselves, may have the same benefit. All persons discharged by this act, are liable to be arrested for debts contracted before the 25th of October. Bankrupts not ob∣taining their certificates in due time, are excluded in this act. All attorneys embez∣zling their clients money are also excluded. The future effects and estates of prisoners discharged, liable to their creditors. Debtors to the crown, and prisoners who owe above 1000l. to one per∣son, unless the creditors con∣sent, are excluded in this act; and creditors opposing the prisoner's discharge, to allow him 3s. 6d. per week; on non-payment to be dis∣charged. All persons enti∣tled to the benefit of this act, are to obtain their dis∣charges before the 31st of March, 1763. Creditors may compel any prisoner, charged in execution, to appear at the quarter-session, with the co∣py of his detainer, and deli∣ver in a schedule of his estate, and on his subscribing the same, and making a disco∣very of his estate, he is to be discharged; on refusing so to do, or concealing to the amount of 20l. suffers as a felon. Prisoners upon pro∣cess out of the courts of con∣science are included in this act; and all who took the benefit of the act 28th George II. to be excluded. Mari∣ners, and those who have been in the sea or land service, are upon their discharge, if under fifty years of age, and approved of, to serve during the present war; and if they desert, may be ar∣rested and imprisoned at the suit of their creditors.</NOTE>. It imports, that as many persons too often choose rather to continue
<PB N="204" REF="2070"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> in prison, and spend their substance there, than discover and deliver up to their creditors their estates or effects, towards satisfying their just debts; the creditor may compel any prisoner, committed, or who shall hereafter be committed, and charged in execution, to appear at the quarter-sessions, with the copy of his detainer, and deliver, upon oath, a just schedule of his estate; that a prisoner, subscribing the schedule, and making a discovery of his estate, shall be discharged at the general or quarter sessions, under this act; and that on his re∣fusal so to do, or concealing to the amount of twenty pounds, he shall suffer as a felon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bad con∣sequences of the compell∣ing clause.</NOTE> This compulsive clause was attended with a con∣sequence, which, in all probability, the legislature did not foresee. Great numbers of tradesmen, and people in the lower classes of life, and even many who had moved in a superior sphere, were said to have laid hold on this opportunity of dis∣encumbering themselves from their debts, which might have been honestly payed by a proper exer∣tion of industry and temperance. Every person, desirous of reaping the benefit of the act, prevailed upon some relation or friend to perform the part of compelling creditor. The public complained that the gaols about London were crouded with a succession of these voluntary captives; and that a great number of honest men were ruined by this indulgence shewn to their debtors by the clemency of parliament. Certain it is, the common council
<PB N="205" REF="2080"/>
of the city of London, in their instructions to their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> representatives in the new parliament, recommend∣ed to them to use their best endeavours to procure the repeal of this compulsive clause, as a manifest grievance to the public. That it is an encourage∣ment to idleness and profligacy, and a strong temp∣tation to fraud, in the minds of the vulgar, are truths which cannot be denied. At the same time we must consider, that the greatest national advan∣tage may be attended with some inconvenience; that the advantage flowing from this clause is great and manifest, as it emancipates many citizens from the worst kind of slavery, prevents great numbers from abandoning their country, and reunites to the community many useful members, of whose talents and industry it would otherwise be totally deprived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other bills that received the royal assent.</NOTE> A bill was formed, and passed into a law, for extending to hog's lard and grease the late act to discontinue, for a limited time, the duties payable upon tallow imported from Ireland. They took measures for continuing the act "for the better securing and encouraging the trade of his majesty's sugar-colonies in America," which was near ex∣piring. A bill was prepared, and passed, enabling the king to make leases and copies of offices, lands and hereditaments, parcel of his dutchy of Cornwal, or annexed to the same, and for other purposes therein mentioned. Another was esta∣blished for preventing frauds committed by per∣sons navigating small boats, with provisions and re∣freshments, upon the river Thames. This mea∣sure was the effect of a petition, representing the
<PB N="206" REF="2090"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> numerous thefts and robberies that were commit∣ted upon the river, to the great loss and detriment of merchants, owners of ships, vessels, and other crafts belonging to the port of London, as well as to the inhabitants and occupiers of wharss, yards, and tenements adjoining to the river. The sanc∣tion of the legislature was also given to a bill for amending the law intituled, "An act to amend, and render more effectual, a former act for the fur∣ther qualification of justices of the peace," so far as it obliged those who had already taken and sub∣scribed the qualification-oath, to take and subscribe the same again at the general or quarter session of the peace for the county, riding, or division, for which they intend to act in quality of justices. Earl Marischal of Scotland, who had so lately ob∣tained his pardon, was now further indulged by the royal bounty: a small ballance on the purchase of one of his family estates, which had been for∣feited in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, remaining still unpaid to the government by the trustees of the purchaser, the earl presented a petition to the house of commons, expressing his hope that his present majesty would, in compassion to the sufferings of the petitioner, and the distresses of his family, be graciously pleased to grant unto him, for his present support, what remained due to the crown of the purchase money, provided his majesty was enabled so to do by the authority of parliament: he therefore prayed, that leave might be given to bring in a bill for this purpose. The king reinforced this petition with a gracious mes∣sage, signified to the house by the chancellor of the
<PB N="207" REF="2100"/>
Exchequer. The request was granted; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> bill being admitted, soon passed into a law. In consequence of this favour, the earl, in his old age, retrieved about six thousand pounds of his original fortune, which was valued at above fifty thousand pounds when he suffered the attainder: but this wretched pittance being insufficient to maintain him in his own country, he found himself obliged to reside abroad; so that he seemed to reap very little comfort from the pardon which he had been so solicitous to obtain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Messages from the king to the com∣mons.</NOTE> In the month of January the king sent a message to the commons, importing, that his majesty being sensible of the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects in North America have exerted themselves, in defence of his just rights and pos∣sessions, recommended it to the house to take their services into consideration, and enable his majesty to give them a proper recompence for the expence incurred by the respective provinces in levying, cloathing, and maintaining the troops they had raised, according as the active vigour and strenuous efforts of the respective provinces should appear to merit. This intimation was referred to the committee of supply, and that resolution taken in favour of the American provinces which we have mentioned above among the grants of the year. The royal message was likewise procured in favour of the East India company, for enabling them to defray the expence of a military force in India; and they were accordingly gratified with the sum already specified under that article. The sums which the commons granted for the support of
<PB N="208" REF="2110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> the Foundling-hospital, and the further reparation of London-bridge, were the result of accurate in∣quiry. The parliament passed several private bills for the naturalization of foreigners; and a good number relating to the improvement of highways, as well as of wastes or commons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's speech in favour of the judges.</NOTE> In the beginning of March the king proposed a step for securing the independency of the judges, which could not fail to impress the subject with the most favourable opinion of his royal candour and moderation. In a speech from the throne he in∣formed both houses of parliament, that, upon granting new commissions to the judges, the pre∣sent state of their offices fell naturally under con∣sideration; that notwithstanding the act passed in the reign of king William III. for settling the suc∣cession to the crown, by which act the commissions of the judges were continued in force during their good behaviour; yet their offices had determined at the demise of the crown, or in six months after that event, as often as it had happened: that as he looked upon the independency and uprightness of the judges as essential to the impartial admini∣stration of justice, one of the best securities to the rights and liberties of his subjects, as well as con∣ducive to the honour of the crown, he recom∣mended this interesting object to the consideration of parliament, in order that such further provision might be made for securing the judges in the en∣joyment of their offices during their good beha∣viour, notwithstanding any such demise, as should be most expedient. He desired of the commons, in particular, that he might be enabled to grant,
<PB REF="2120"/>

and establish upon the judges, such salaries as he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>61.</NOTE> should think proper, so as to be absolutely secured to them during the continuance of their commis∣sions. He thanked both houses for the great una∣nimity and application with which they had hither∣to carried on the public business; exhorting them to proceed with the same good disposition, and with such dispatch, that this session might be brought to a happy conclusion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Resoluti∣ons taken in conse∣quence of that speech.</NOTE> The speech was received with that applause which was due to such a declaration. The com∣mons unanimously resolved to display their satis∣faction in an address to the throne. They acknow∣ledged the most grateful sense of his majesty's at∣tention to an object so interesting to his people. They assured him, that his faithful commons saw with joy and veneration the warm regard and con∣cern which animated his royal breast for the secu∣rity of the religion, laws, liberties, and properties of his subjects; that the house would immediately proceed upon the important work recommended by his majesty with such tender care of his people; and would enable him to establish the salaries of the judges in such a permanent manner, that they might be enjoyed during the continuance of their commissions. They forthwith began to deliberate upon this subject; and their resolutions terminated in a law, importing, among other articles, That such part of the salaries of the judges as was be∣fore payable out of the yearly sums granted for the support of the king's houshold, and of the honour and dignity of the crown, should, after the demise of his present majesty, be charged upon
<PB N="210" REF="2140"/>

Thus the individuals, intrusted with the administration of the laws, were effectually emancipated from the power of the prerogative, and of all undue in∣fluence.</P>
<P>It was also in the beginning of March that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's message to the house of com∣mons.</NOTE> chancellor of the Exchequer delivered a message from the king to the commons, couched in these terms: "His majesty, relying on the known zeal and affection of his faithful commons, and consi∣dering that in this critical conjuncture, emergen∣cies may arise, which may be of the utmost impor∣tance, and be attended with the most pernicious consequences, if proper means should not be im∣mediately applied to prevent or defeat them; is desirous that this house will enable him to defray any extraordinary expences of the war, incurred, or to be incurred, for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty one; and to take all such measures as may be necessary to disappoint or defeat any enterprizes or designs of his enemies, and as the exigency of affairs may require." The message was immediately referred to the considera∣tion of the committee of supply; and his majesty was provided with one million, upon account, as we have specified above.</P>
<P>Mr. Onslow, who had so long filled the speaker's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honours conferred upon Mr. Onslow.</NOTE> chair with dignity, capacity, and candour, having declared his intention to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from business, in consequence of age, infirmities, and other motive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

of a private nature, the commons immediately<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> honoured him with very distinguishing marks of regard. They unanimously resolved, that the thanks of the house should be given to Mr. Speaker, for his constant and unwearied attendance in the chair, during the course of above thirty-three years, in five successive parliaments; for the un∣shaken integrity and steady impartiality of his con∣duct there; and for the indefatigable pains he had, with uncommon abilities, constantly taken to promote the real interest of his king and country, to maintain the honour and dignity of parliament, and to preserve inviolable the rights and privileges of the commons of Great Britain. The venerable patriot was so much affected by this proof of their love and esteem, that he could not answer but in broken sentences, bursting unconnectedly from a heart that swelled too big for easy utterance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"I was never under so great a difficulty in my life to know what to say in this place, as I am at present—Indeed it is almost too much for me.—I can stand against misfortunes and distresses: I have stood against misfor∣tunes and distresses; and may do so again; but I am not able to stand this overflow of good will and honour to me. It overpowers me; and had I all the strength of lan∣guage, I could never express the fall sentiments of my heart, upon this occasion, of thanks and gratitude. If I have been happy enough to perform any services here, that are acceptable to the house, I am sure I now re∣ceive the noblest reward for them; the noblest that any man can receive for any me∣rit, far superior, in my esti∣mation, to all the other emo∣luments of this world. I owe every thing to this house; I not only owe to this house, that I am in this place, but that I have had their constant support in it; and to their good will and assistance, their tenderness and indulgence towards me in my errors, it is, that I have been able to perform my duty here to any degree of approbation; thanks therefore are not so much due to me for these services, as to the house itself, who made them to be services in me.</P>
<P>"When I began my duty here, I set out with a resolu∣tion, and promise to the house, to be impartial in every thing, and to shew re∣spect to every body. The first I know I have done, it is the only merit I can as∣sume: if I have failed in the other, it was unwillingly, it was inadvertently; and I ask their pardon, most sincerely, to whomsoever it may have happened—I can truly say, the giving satisfaction to all has been my constant aim, my study, and my pride.</P>
<P>"And now, Sirs, I am to take my last leave of you. It is, I confess, with regret, because the being within these walls has ever been the chief pleasure of my life: but my advanced age and infirmities, and some other reasons, call for retirement and obscurity. There I shall spend the re∣mainder of my days; and shall only have power to hope and to pray, and my hopes and prayers, my daily prayer, will be, for the con∣tinuance of the constitution in general, and that the free∣dom, the dignity, and au∣thority of this house may be perpetual."</P></NOTE>.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> For that reason his speech was the more agreeable to the house, who forthwith resolved, that thanks should be given to Mr. Speaker for what he now said; that his answer should be printed in the votes of the day; that an adress should be presented to the king, humbly to beseech his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased to confer some signal mark of his royal favour upon the right honourable Arthur Onflow, esquire, speaker of their house, for his great and eminent services performed to his country, for the space of thirty-three years and upwards, during which he had with such distin∣guished ability and integrity presided in the chair; and to assure his majesty, that whatever expence he

should think proper to be incurred upon that ac∣count,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> the house would make it good. This ap∣plication was very agreeable to the king's own ge∣nerous disposition. He expressed a proper sense of the speaker's great services and unblemished cha∣racter; and he was gratified with an annual pen∣sion of three thousand pounds, payable out of his majesty's treasure at the Exchequer, for his own life and that of his son. All the business of the session being dispatched, and all the bills having received the royal sanction, the king closed the scene with a speech from the throne on the nine∣teenth day of March <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"My lords and gentle∣men,</P>
<P>"I cannot put an end to this session, without declaring my entire satisfaction in your procedings during the course of it.

Nothing could so much add to the pleasure, which these consi∣derations afford me, as that I am now able to acquaint you with the great progress made of late by the com∣bined army in Germany, un∣der the command of prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. I formerly told you, that the nature of the war, in those parts, had kept the cam∣paign there still depending; and it now appears, to the surprize of my enemies, that the superior ability and inde∣fatigable activity of my ge∣neral, and the spirit and ar∣dour of my officers and troops, have greatly profited of this perseverance, not∣withstanding all the difficul∣ties arising from the season.</P>

The common people being determined to oppose this regulation, as an insup∣portable grievence, assembled to the number of five thousand of both sexes, and of all ages, some of them armed with clubs, and some with fire∣arms. The justices, apprehensive of some such

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> disorder, had procured a battalion of the York∣shire militia for their guard, and these were drawn up in the maket-place. The populace being re∣inforced by a body of disperate keelmen from Newcastle, began to insult the guard with re∣proaches, missiles, and even with blows, which the militia for some time sustained with all the tem∣perance of perfect discipline. The riot act was read, and the people were exhorted to retire to their respective habitations. But instead of com∣plying with this advice, they became more intract∣able. Encouraged by the forbearance of the mi∣litia, and possessed with a notion that they would not commit hostilities, they proceeded from one act of outrage to another; assaulted them as they stood arranged in order of battle, and with fire∣arms killed an officer and a private soldier. Thus exasperated, the militia poured in upon them a regular discharge, by which forty-five of the po∣pulace were killed upon the spot, and three hun∣dred miserably wounded. The survivors imme∣diately betook themselves to flight, and many dropped down upon the road in their retreat. The most lamentable part of this disaster was a circum∣stance which attends all such unfortunate occa∣sions: some hapless women and children, drawn thither by curiosity, or the more laudable motive of persuading their husbands, parents, or kinsmen to retire, were confounded and perished in the un∣distinguishing vengeance of the day. Some of the rioters, being apprehended, were tried for high treason, convicted, condemned, and executed for examples.</P>

As the last year was distinguished by an atrocious murder committed in London by a foreigner, so the present exhibited an instance of another stranger, who, in the same city, performed a deed of the same kind, though attended with much more savage and horrible circumstances. One Theodore Gardelle, a Swiss painter, being warmed with some trivial provocation, layed vio∣lent hands on Mrs. King, in whose house he lodged, near Leicester square, and deprived her of life in her own apartment. The rage of passion which prompted him to this excess was succeeded by a transport of terror, which hurried him into such measures for his own preservation as the humane reader will not understand without shuddering. He concealed what had passed by locking the apartment where the body lay, and by dismissing the maid servant, who happened to be absent when the murder was committed. He had sent her upon some errand to a different part of the town, as if the murder had been a premeditated scheme: when she returned, he told her Mrs. King was gone suddenly to the country, and had directed him to dismiss her from her service. He accordingly payed what wages were due to this woman, and she retired. Being now in possession of the house, he passed the night alone in his own apartment. Next morning he descended to the chamber where the body of the unhappy woman lay, separated the
<PB N="220" REF="2240"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> head, and even dissected it with the most gloomy deliberation. This he consumed by fire: the bowels he took out, and buried in the soil of the privy. He then dismembered the body, and de∣stroyed the limbs with a fire made of green wood, that the smell of flesh might not alarm the neigh∣bours. He divided the trunk in small pieces, and carrying part of them in a sack, threw them into the river. This was a work of time, which he seemed to brood over with a kind of horrid enjoy∣ment. In the intervals of his labour, he solaced himself with the conversation of a prostitute, who lay with him in the house, and from whose side he rose early in the morning, in order to finish his dreadful task. His guilt could not be long con∣cealed. The sudden disappearance of Mrs. King, and the distracted behaviour of the assassin, created suspicion. He found it necessary to employ an occasional domestic, who perceived signs of blood. The servant whom he had dismissed exerted herself in his detection: a warrant was granted for appre∣hending Gardelle; and search being made in the house, parcells of the body were found. The mur∣derer, being brought to trial, was convicted on the fullest evidence, and executed in the open street, not far from the place where the crime was com∣mitted. He confessed the murder; but denied that it was premeditated. He declared that Mrs. King had first reproached, and then struck him; that in pushing her from him, he was the occasion of her falling backwards; that her head pitching on the side of a bed, she seemed to have sustained a fracture of the skull; that terrified by her cries,
<PB N="221" REF="2250"/>
which were loud and continued, he, in despair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> stabbed her in the neck with an ivory bodkin, which happened to lie on her toilet, and finished the tragedy by stifling her with the bedcloaths; that the measures he took in the sequel were prompted by the terrors of detection; that the few days intervened between the murder and the dis∣covery, he passed in a continual perturbation of mind, a kind of hideous dream of horror, from which he waked to penitence and resignation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patrioti∣cal decla∣ration of the king.</NOTE> In the beginning of the year the attention of government was sufficiently employed in renewing commissions for the officers and servants of the crown, in their different departments; in exe∣cuting measures for prosecuting the war with vi∣gour; in establishing the administration on a solid basis; in conferring posts and dignities on those whom the king was pleased to distinguish and honour; in communicating to allies the political system of the new reign; and in receiving or ac∣knowledging the felicitation of foreign powers on the king's succession to the crown of Great Britain. With respect to the new parliament, his majesty, with the genuine spirit of a patriot king, declared he would in no shape intermeddle with the free∣dom of election. He rejected, with disdain, the expedient, practised in former reigns, of employ∣ing the public money to secure what were called the c—n b—ghs. He would not suffer one farthing to be issued from the treasury on this ac∣count; but is said to have told a certain m—r, who pleaded the custom of former times, that, as his whole ambition was to render the nation flou∣rishing

<P>No revolution of any consequence took place in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appoint∣ment of the great officers of state.</NOTE> any branch of religious, civil, or military admi∣nistration. The metropolitan see of Canterbury was worthily filled by Secker, renowned for his piety, candour, and urbanity. The office of lord high chancellor was conserred upon lord Henley, baron Grange, who had eminently distinguished himself at the bar by his independent spirit, know∣ledge, and integrity. Lord Mansfield maintained his seat on the King's Bench, and judge Willes in the Common Pleas. The ministry and cabinet council underwent no material alteration, except in the accession of the earl of Bute, who succeeded the earl of Holdernesse as seceretary of state for the northern department and was supposed to stand with Mr Pitt, the other secretary, as joint pilot at the helm of administration. The duke of New∣castle still directed the treasury, and, like Fortune's chief minister, dispensed the blessings of prefer∣ment among a vast number of dependants. Earl Granville presided at the council; and lord Anson at the board of admiralty, Earl Temple kept the privy seal; and Mr. Legge acted as chancellor of the Exchequer, though in a little time he was dis∣missed from that employment. Mr. Charles Townshend being appointed secretary at war, soon proved by his conduct the salla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of that maxim which holds genius inconsistent with industry; and performed every part of this office with such accu∣racy

The lucrative post of paymaster remained with Mr. Henry Fox, who had fought a surprising battle with the first dema∣gogues of the age; and who, in shrewdness, poli∣cy, and perseverance, yielded to none of his co∣temporaries. The management of the king's houshold devolved upon noblemen of unblemished characters. The chamberlain's wand was delivered to the duke of Devonshire, universally beloved for his generosity and sweetness of disposition. The duke of Rutland, so distinguished for his benevo∣lence, was created master of the horse; and the office of lord steward was bestowed upon earl Tal∣bot, whose sense and probity added lustre to that unconquerable spirit of patriotism which he pos∣sessed. To the irresistible penetration and invin∣cible courage of this nobleman the Herculean task was left of reforming the numerous and enormous abuses which had crept into the oeconomy of the king's houshold; and this arduous task he per∣formed with unremitting vigour, unmoved by cla∣mour, unseduced by solicitation: unnecessary of∣fices were extinguished, pluralities dissolved, un∣conscionable perquisites retrenched, and all sorts of fraud abolished.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Increase of luxury and riot.</NOTE> At this period the strength of Great Britain ap∣peared in the zenith of its power and splendour. The people of England were seemingly transported beyond the limits of sober reason and reflection. The trophies of war with which their fancies were dazzled, in a succession of favourable events, had ac∣customed them to idleness, arrogance, and festivity. The spirit of revelry maddened through the land. Even to the extremities of the kingdom the high∣ways were crouded with the votaries of pleasure, whirled to and fro in gaudy equipages, as if they had been actuated by the demons of desperation. In the metropolis the snares of luxury were ex∣tended to the refuse of the people. The lowest traders were hurried into the vortex of dissipation: they grew enamoured of diversion, and vied with their superiors in finery and expence. They had their balls, and their musick-meetings. They af∣fected to rival the first quality of the kingdom in their manners, habit, and domestic parties. They
<PB N="226" REF="2320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> intruded themselves into all public assemblies, which degenerated accordingly in point of elegance and decorum. Every place of polite resort became a temple of brutal confusion; and the conductors of the theatrical exhibitions thought their entertain∣ments but indifferently received, if every repeated representation did not produce a tumult, and some lives were not endangered by the thronging of the audience. This riotous disposition was inflamed by those scenes of military parade and preparation, which were continually passing before the eyes of the people; the processions of recruiting parties, the evolutions of discipline, new levies of troops, marches and countermarches of entire battalions, and the warlike appearance of the national militia, which was by this time improved into a body of established troops fit for service. All these cir∣cumstances ushered in a profusion of idle pagean∣try, displayed in scenes of barbarous pomp, pre∣scribed by the forms of the constitution, for cele∣brating the king's coronation. A proclamation was issued, appointing the twenty-second day of September for this ceremony; so that the curiosity of weak minds was fostered, during the whole sum∣mer, to such a degree of impatience, that the whole attention of the people seemed to center in this gaudy spectacle; such preparations were made, and such eagerness was expressed by persons of all degrees, that one would have imagined the whole nation on the brink of lunacy.</P>
<P>The king, ever attentive to the great purposes of his elevation, and desirous of giving all possible permanency to the present happy establishment

<P>This declaration was so agreeable to the council that they unanimously requested it might be made publick for the satisfaction of the nation in general.

The ambassador and the ladies were magnificently en∣tertained; and the event was celebrated with the most splended rejoicings. On the seventeenth day of the month, the princess, accompanied by the reigning duke her brother, set out with all her at∣tendants for Mirow, and proceeded to Perleberg, where the count de Gotter complimented her in the name of the Prussian monarch. From thence she continued her journey to Leu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zen and Gourde, and on the twenty-second arrived at Stade, under a general discharge of cannon, and amidst the ac∣clamations of the people.

Seats and scaffolds were prepared along the shore for several miles; and all the publicans residing near the banks of the river, both in Kent and Es∣sex, were enriched by an amazing conflux of com∣pany. Every individual observed the wind as ear∣nestly as if his whole fortune depended on the first change of weather; and London poured forth her swarms, like an immense hive, during the first gleams of vernal sunshine. All the medicinal wells to which wealthy people resort in the sum∣mer, either for health or pleasure, were now de∣serted; and numbers flocked to the metropolis from all parts of the united kingdom to see their sovereign's bride, and be eye▪witnesses of the en∣suing coronation. After a tedious voyage of ten<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her arri∣val and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uptials.</NOTE> days, during which the fleet was exposed to con∣trary winds and tempestuous weather, the princess landed on the seventh day of September in the af∣ternoon at Harwich, where she was received by the mayor and aldermen in their formalities.

Their applause was sig∣nified in tumultuous acclamations, which attended her for several miles; and the eagerness of the po∣pulace was carried even to a degree of licentious zeal, which the guards could hardly restrain within the bounds of decent respect. Thus accompanied by great numbers of people in carriages, on horse∣back, and a foot, this amiable princess proceeded through Hyde-park, down Constitution-hill, to the garden-gate of the palace of St. James, where she was handed out of her coach by the duke of Devonshire, in quality of lord chamberlain. At the gate she was received by the duke of York, and in the garden she was met by the king himself, whose looks declared the transports of his joy. When she made her obeisance, he raised her by the hand, which he kissed, and then led her up-stairs to the palace, where they dined together, with the whole royal family. At nine the nuptial ceremony was performed in the royal chapel, which had been magnificently decorated for the occasion. Besides the royal family, all the great officers of state, the nobility, peers and peeresses, and the foreign mi∣nisters, were present at the service, the conclusion of which was announced to the people by the dis∣charge of the artillery in the Park and at the Tower; and the cities of London and Westminster were il∣luminated in honour of this auspicious event. Nothing was now seen at court but splendour and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estivity, exhibiting all the marks of mirth and sa∣tisfaction.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremo∣ny of the corona∣tion.</NOTE> But the ceremony of the coronation still re∣mained to be undergone, and was undoubtedly a severe trial of patience to a prince of true taste and sentiment. A commission had long ago passed the great seal, constituting a court to decide the pretensions of a great number of people, who laid claim to different offices and privileges in the cele∣bration of this necessary form; many of these so frivolous, and uncouth, as to throw an air of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>di∣cule on the whole transaction. Westminster-hall was prepared for the coronation▪banquet, by re∣moving the courts of judicature, boarding the floor, erecting canopies, and building three rows of galleries for the accommodation of spectators. A platform was laid between this Hall and the Abbey-church, where the king is actually crowned. All the houses and streets within sight of the pro∣cession were faced and crowded with benches and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assolding, which extended on both sides within the Abbey from the western entrance almost up to the choir. The prospect formed by these occa∣sional erections, which were surprisingly calculated for security and convenience, could not fail to awaken the expectation of the spectator for some∣thing solemn and sublime: but when all these benches were filled with above two hundred thou∣sand people, of both sexes, arrayed in gay apparel,

<P>The ostentation of this year was closed with the anniversary pageants that celebrate the election of a new lord-mayor in the city of London. As the kings and queens of Great Britain are always entertained at Guildhall by the magistrate who happens to be chosen in the year of the corona∣tion, extraordinary preparations were made for the reception of their majesties; who, with a great number of the nobility, honoured the banquet, in the midst of the most tumultuous expressions of loyalty and attachment that ever were known on any former occasion.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> Even from the beginning of winter, the sin∣gle ships that cruised in the Channel were con∣ducted with such care and dexterity, that they made prize of a great number of French priva∣teers; a circumstance that evinced their own vi∣gilance and the enemy's activity. In the month of January captain Elphinston, commander of the Richmond, mounted with thirty-two guns, fell in with the Felicite, a French frigate, of the same force, off the coast of Holland; and a se∣vere engagement began about ten in the morn∣ing, near Gravesande, about eight miles from the Hague, to which place the prince of Orange, general Yorke the British envoy, and the count d'Affry the French ambassador, repaired with a great multitude of people, to behold the progress and issue of the battle. About noon both ships ran ashore: nevertheless the action was still main∣tained, until the enemy deserted their quarters▪ they afterwards abandoned the ship, which was in∣tirely destroyed, after having lost their captain and about one hundred men, who sell in the dispute. The Richmond soon floated, without any damage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the victory cost but three men killed, and thir∣teen wounded. The French court loudly ex∣claimed against this attack as a violation of the Dutch neutrality, and demanded signal satisfaction for the insult and damage they had sustained. Ac∣cordingly the States General made some remon∣strances to the court of London, which found means to remove all cause of misunderstanding or on this subject. The Felicite was bound for Marti∣nique, with a valuable cargo, in company with

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Engage∣ment by captain Hood.</NOTE> In the course of the same month, captain Hood, commander of the Minerva frigate, cruising in the chops of the channel, descried a great ship of two decks steering to the westward, and found it was the Warwick, an English ship, which had carried sixty cannon, and been taken by the enemy. She was now mounted with thirty-five guns, and com∣manded by Mr. le Verger de Belair, with a com∣mission from the French king. Her crew amount∣ed to about three hundred men, including a de∣tachment of soldiers; and he was bound to Pon∣dicherry in the East Indies. Captain Hood, not∣withstanding her superior size, attacked her with∣out hesitation, and was very warmly received. Several masts in both ships were shot away, and they fell foul of one another, while the sea ran very high; so that the crews on both sides were greatly encumbered by their broken masts and shattered rigging. At length the waves separated them, and the Warwick fell to leeward. Captain Hood, having cleared ship, bore directly down upon the enemy: then the engagement was re∣newed, and lasted about an hour; at the expiration of which the captain of the Warwick struck his colours, having lost about fourteen men killed outright, besides thirty-five wounded. The loss in number of men was equal on board the Miner∣va, and all her masts went by the board: never∣theless the prize was brought in triumph to Spit∣head. In the progress of the same cruize captain Hood had also taken the Ecurncil privateer from

The action was main∣tained on both sides with uncommon fury, until the Vengeance being set on fire by the enemy's wadding, the French resolved to take advantage of the confusion produced by this accident, and, running their bowsprit upon the taffaril of the English frigate, attempted to board her. In this design however they miscarried, through the cou∣rage and activity of captain Nightingale, who found means to disengage himself, and sheered o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to repair his rigging, which had greatly suffered i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the engagement.

About the same period, and near the same place, a fourth frigate of the enemy, called the Pheasant, manned with one hundred and twenty-five mariners, was engaged, taken, and brought to Spithead, by captain Brograve, commander of the Albany sloop, whose victory was the cheaper, as the crew of the Pheasant had thrown fourteen of their guns over∣board during the chace.

Captain Wheeler being unfortunately killed in the beginning of the action, the com∣mand devolved to lieutenant Cunningham, who perceiving at length that the enemy's design was to reach, if possible, the Spanish shore, boarded her without further hesitation: and in a little time, her commander submitting, she was brought into the bay of Gibraltar. The number of her killed and wounded amounted to forty-five, out of a com∣plement of three hundred and seventy: the loss of the Isis did not exceed four killed and nine wounded. In July another exploit was performed by a small detachment from the squadron com∣manded by the same admiral.

About midnight the Thunderer came up with the Achilles, which struck, after a warm engagement of half an hour: yet, in this short action, captain Proby had near forty men killed, and above one hundred wounded, he himself having sustained a slight hurt in the right arm. About seven in the same morning the Thetis engaged the Bouffon, and the fire was maintained on both sides with great vivacity for half an hour, when the Modeste ranging up, and firing a few guns, the French captain sub∣mitted.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able en∣gagement by the captains Faulkner and Lo∣gie.</NOTE> One of the most remarkable and shining actions that distinguished this war, and proved beyond all contradiction the superiority which the English claimed over the French in point of naval disci∣pline, was an incident which we shall now relate. On Monday the tenth of August, captain Faulk∣ner of the Bellona, a ship of the line, and captain Logie of the Brilliant, a frigate of thirty guns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed from the river Tagus for England, having on board a considerable sum of money for the mer∣chants of London. On Thursday in the afternoon, being then off Vigo, they discovered three fail of ships standing in for the land, one of the line of battle, and two frigates. They no sooner descried captain Faulkner, than they bore down upon him, until within the distance of seven miles, when, see∣ing the Bellona and the frigate through the mag∣nifying medium of a hazy atmosphere, they mis∣took them both for two-decked ships, and dread∣ing the issue of an engagement, resolved to avoid the encounter. For this purpose they suddenly wore round, filled all their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ails, and crouded away. Captain Faulkner being by this time convinced of their size, and conjecturing, from the intelligence he had received, that the large ship was the Cou∣rageux (in which particular he was not mistaken), he hoisted all the canvas he could carry, and gave chace until sun-set, when one of the French fri∣gates hauling out in the offing, he displayed a
<PB N="240" REF="2470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> signal to the Brilliant to pursue in that direction and his order was immediately obeyed. They kept sight of the enemy during the whole night and at sun-rise had gained but about two mile upon them in a chace of fourteen hours; so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the French commodore might have still avoided a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engagement for the whole day, and enjoyed the chance of escaping in the darkness of the succeed¦ing night; but he no longer declined the action The air being perfectly serene, he now perceived that one of the English ships was a frigate; and the Bellona herself, which was one of the best con∣stituted ships in the English navy, lay so flush in the water as to appear at a distance considerably smaller than she really was. The French com∣mander, therefore, being a man of spirit, hoisted a red ensign on the mizzen shrouds, as a signal for his two frigates to close with and engage the Bril∣liant. At the same time he hauled down his stud¦ding sails, wore round, and stood for the Bellona under his topsails; while captain Faulkner ad∣vanced towards her with an easy sail, and ordere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his quarters to be manned. The sea was und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lated by a gentle breeze, which facilitated th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> working of the ships, and at the same time per¦mitted the full use of their heavy artillery. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two ships were equal in burthen, in number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guns, and in weight of metal. The crew on boar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Courageux amounted to seven hundred men able to stand to their quarters; and they were com¦manded by M. du Guy Lambert, an officer of ap¦proved valour and ability. The Bellona's comple¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent consisted of five hundred and fifty chose

men, accustomed to discipline, and inured to ser∣vice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1761▪</NOTE> All the officers were gentlemen of known merit, and the commander had on many occasions distinguished himself by his bravery and conduct. The fire on both sides was suspended until they were within musket shot of each other, and then the engagement began with a dreadful discharge of fire-arms and artillery. In less than nine mi∣nutes all the Bellona's braces, bowlings, shrowds, and rigging, were cut and shatt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red by the shot, and the m zen mast fell over the stern, with all the men on the round top, who, nevertheless, saved their lives, by clambering into the port∣holes of the gun-room. Captain Faulkener, ap∣prehensive that the enemy would seize the oppor∣tunity of his being disabled, and endeavour to escape, gave orders for immediate boarding; an attempt which the position of the two ships soon rendered altogether impracticable. The Coura∣geux was now falling athwart the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re foot, or bows of the Bellona, in which case the English ship must have been raked fore and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with great execution. The haul yards, and most of the other ropes by which the Bellona could be worked, were already shot away. Captain Faulkener, how∣ever, with the assistance of his master, made use of the studding sails with such dexterity, as to ware the ship quite round, and fail upon the opposite quarter of the Courageux. His presence of mind and activity in this delicate situation, were not more admirable than the discipline and dispatch of his officers and men, who perceiving this change in their position, flew to the guns on the other

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> side, now opposed to the enemy, from whence they poured in a most terrible discharge, and maintained it without intermission or abatement. Every shot took place, and bore destruction along with it. The sides of the Courageux were shatter∣ed and torn by every successive broadside, and her decks were strewed with carnage. About twenty minutes did the enemy sustain the havock made by this battery, so incessantly plied, and so fatally di∣rected. At length it became so intolerable, that the French ensign was hauled down: the rage of battle ceased; the English mariners had left their quarters, and the officers congratulated each other on the success of the day. At this juncture a shot being unexpectedly fired from the lower tier of the Courageux, the British seamen ran to their quarters, and, without orders, poured in two broadsides upon the enemy, who now called for quarter, and an end was put to the engagement. The damage done to the rigging of the Bellona was considerable, but she suffered very little in the hull, and the number of the killed and wounded did not exceed forty. The case was very different with the Courageux, which now ap∣peared like a wreck upon the water. Nothing was seen standing but her foremast and bow▪sprit; large breaches were made in her sides; her decks were torn up in several parts; many of her guns were dismounted; and her quarters were filled with the mangled bodies of the dying and the dead. Above two hundred and twenty were kil∣led outright, and half that number was brought ashore wounded to Lisbon, to which place the
<PB N="243" REF="2500"/>
prize was conveyed. Captain Faulkener was not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> more commendable for his gallantry in the action, than for the humanity and politeness with which he treated his prisoners, whose grateful acknow∣ledgement, and unsolicited applause, constitute the fairest testimony that a man of honour can en∣joy. Nor ought we to with hold our praise from Capt. Logie of the Brilliant, whose valour and dexterity, in a great measure, contributed to the success of his commodore. Perceiving it would be impossible for him to acquire any thing but laurels from two frigates, the least of which was of equal strength with the ship he commanded; he resolved to amuse them both, so as to hinder either from assisting the Courageux. He accord∣ingly began the action by engaging one of them, called la Malicieuse. The other coming up, he withstood their joint efforts, so as to employ their whole fire, while the great ships were engaged, and even above half an hour after the Courageux had struck her colours. Finally, he obliged them both to sheer off, and to consult their safety in flight, after they had suffered considerably in their masts and rigging. Captain Faulkener returned to Lisbon with his prize, which had well nigh perished by accident, before he reached the Tagus. A cask of spirituous liquor catching fire near one of the magazines, the ship must have blown up, had not she been saved by the presence of mind and re∣solution of Mr. Male, the first lieutenant. Ob∣serving the flames already communicated to some combustibles that happened to be in the way, he leaped down the hatch-way into the midst of

The centinel who had kindhed the fire by admitting a candle too near the spirits, was burned to death; and twenty French prisoners hearing the alarm, leaped into the sea, where they perished. The two English captains joined in a liberal subscription with the British fac∣tory at Lisbon, for the relief of the wounded French prisoners, who, without this generous interposition, must have starved, as no provision was made by their sovereign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduc∣tion of Mihie, in the East Indies.</NOTE> Nothing else of any importance was atchieved against the enemy in this part of the world: but some advantages were gained in the East and West Indies. After the reduction of Pondicherry on the coast of Coromandel, an armament was equipped against the French settlement of Mihie, situated on the coast of Malabar, about thirty miles to the northward of Tillicherry. A body of forces was embarked at Bombay for this expedition, under the command of Major Hector Monro, who took his measures so well, in concert with Mr. Hodges, commander for the English at Tillicherry, and acted with so much vigour in the execution of the scheme, that in the beginning of February, Mr. Louet, commander in chief of the French garrison at Mihie, surrendered the place with all its depen∣dencies. Though this acquisition is of no great consequence to the English, merely as a trading port, the loss of it must be severely felt by the enemy, who had fortified it at a considerable ex∣pence, and mounted the fortifications with above two hundred pieces of cannon.</P>

It had been a favourite scheme of the minister, to reduce the island of Belleisle on the coast of Brittany, and this was the aim of the expedition. Belleisle lies about four leagues from the point of Quiberon, about half way between Port Louis and the mouth of the Loire. It extends about six leagues in length, and little more than two in breadth; con∣tains a pretty large twon called Palais, fortified with a citadel, besides a good number of villages▪ and the whole number of inhabitants, exclusive

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> of the garrison, may amount to six thousand, chiefly maintained by the fishery of pilchards. It was supposed the reduction of this islands would be easily atchieved, and the conquest attended with manisold advantages: that it would alarm the French nation, and oblige them to maintain a nu∣merous body of forces on the opposite continent; consequently make a considerable diversion in fa∣vour of the British army in the north of Germany: that its central situation would render it an effec∣tual check upon Port l'Orient, and disable the enemy from equipping any naval armament at Brest; as all the materials for building and fitting out ships in time of war, were brought thither from Port Louis, Nantz, and Rochfort, through the channel between Belleisle and the main land, which conveyance they could not pretend to use, if the English were masters of Belleisle: finally, that as all the French ships homeward bound from the East and West-Indies, as well as from other parts of the world, ran in with the land, so as first to make Belleisle, the English, by keeping a small squadron between the island and the main, and a good look out in the offing, would be able to make prize of all those vessels. Such were the reasons urged in favour of this expedition; to which, however, many plausible objections might▪ have been started. Supposing the French mini∣stry so alarmed at this enterprize as to keep twenty thousand m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n assembled on the opposite shore, this step they could have easily taken, without draught∣ing one man from the war in Germany.

and thirty thousand men: the German war does<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 176<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> not require half that number; consequently they could spare three times the number that would be necessary to defend their sea-coast from invasion; therefore the reduction of Belleisle could make no sort of diversion in favour of the British army in Germany, commanded by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. With respect to the interruption of the French navigation, the same purpose is more effectually answered by maintaining a squadron in the bay of Quiberon, without which the island can be of no use, as it affords not one harbour in which a ship of war could lie at anchor. But the strongest argument against this expedition, was derived from the nature of the island, fenced around by inaccessible rocks, except at a few open∣ings, which the enemy had raised strong bulwarks to defend. In the course of the last summer they had been apprized of the destination of the Bri∣tish armament, and taken great pains to entrench and fortify every place where they thought it was possible to make a descent. The citadel of Pa∣lais, planned and executed by the celebrated en∣gineer Vauban, was counted one of the strongest fortifications belonging to France; and the garri∣son, amounting to above three thousand choice men was commanded by the Chevalier de St. Croix, one of the most resolute and active officers of that kingdom. Why this scheme was preferred to other objects of seemingly greater importance, we shall not pretend to explain: sar less can we account for its being delayed a whole year at such an expence to the nation; as if hostilities had

The whole armament sailed from Spithead on the 29th day of March; and on the seventh of April came to anchor in the great road of Belleisle, where a disposition was made for land∣ing the forces. The commanders having agreed that the descent should be made on the sandy beach near the point of Lomaria, towards the south-east end of the island, a feint was made to attack the citadel of Palais, while two large ships convoyed the troops to the landing-place, and silenced a battery which the enemy had there erected.

In a word, this handful of men being overpowered with numbers, were totally routed, and either killed or taken prisoners; so that this attempt was attended with the loss of near five hundred men, including two sea-officers, and about fifty mariners belonging to the ships that endeavoured to cover the landing. This discouraging check was succeeded by tempestuous weather, which da∣maged some of the transports. When the wind abated, the Prince of Orange ship of war failed round the island, in order to survey the coast, and discover, if possible, some other place for disembarkation: but the whole seemed to be secured by rocks and batteries in such a manner, as precluded all access.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops are disem∣barked.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this unfavourable prospect, ano∣ther scheme was laid, and the execution of it crowned with success. On the twenty-second day of the month in the morning, the troops were disposed in the flat-bottomed boats, and rowed to different parts of the island, as if they intended to land in different places: thus the attention of the enemy was distracted in such a manner, that they knew not where to expect the descent, and were obliged to divide their forces at random.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> Mean while brigadier Lambert pitched upon the rocky point of Lomaria, where Captain Paterson, at the head of Beauclerk's grenadiers, and Cap∣tain Murray▪ with a detachment of marines, climb∣ed the precipice with astonishing intrepidity, and sustained the fire of a strong body of the enemy, until they were supported by the rest of the English troops, who now landed in great num∣bers. Then the French abandoned their batteries, and retired with precipitation: but this advantage was not gained without bloodshed. About forty men were killed, and a considerable number wounded, including Colonel Mackenzie and Cap∣tain Murray of the marines, who seemed to vie with the marching regiments in valour and acti∣vity, and Captain Paterson of Beauclerk's grena∣diers, who lost his arm in the dispute. Monsieur de St. Croix perceiving that all the English troops were disembarked, to the number of eight thou∣sand men, recalled all his detachments to Palais, and prepared for a vigorous defence, his forces, now joined by the militia of the island, amount∣ing to four thousand men fit for service.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third of April, the English troops<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palais in∣vested.</NOTE> were formed into columns, and began their march towards the capital of the island. Next day Gene∣ral Hodgson ordered a detachment of light horse to take post at Sauzon; and on the twenty-fifth, a corps of infantry took possession of a village called Bordilla, where they began to throw up an entrenchment; but they were dislodged by a party of the enemy's grenadiers: the whole army, how∣ever, entrenched itself in the neighbourhood. The

All that he could do, in the mean time, was to publish a manifesto, addressed to the inhabitants, declaring, that, if they would put themselves un∣der the protection of the British government, they should be indulged with the free exercise of their religion, and retain all the rights and privileges which they had ever enjoyed. This assurance pro∣duced a considerable effect among the natives, a good number of whom immediately closed with the proposal. The next step the general took was to summon the French commandant, who re∣mained encamped under the walls of the citadel, and declared he would defend the place to the last extremity; and indeed it must be owned, for the honour of this gentleman, that, in the course of the siege, he performed every thing that could be expected from a gallant officer, consummate in the art of war. About the latter end of April, some mortars being brought up, began to play upon the town, within the walls of which the enemy now retired; and at this juncture Sir William Peere Williams, a captain in Burgoyne's light horse, was shot by a French centinel, in recon∣noitring their situation.

The damage they had done was next day repaired: a redoubt was begun near the right of their works; and from this period the operations of the siege were prosecuted with unremitting vi∣gour, notwithstanding a severe fire maintained without interruption, and a succession of well-con∣certed sallies, which were not executed without a considerable effusion of blood.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cita∣del capi∣tulates.</NOTE> The English being now masters of the whole island except the citadel of Palais, bent all their endeavours to the reduction of this fortress, which was very strong both by art and situation, and de∣fended with uncommon courage and perseverance on the side of the besiegers. Parallels were finished, barricadoes made, and batteries constructed; and an incessant fire from mortars and artillery was mutually maintained, by night and by day, from the thirteenth of May to the twenty-fifth, when that of the enemy began to abate. In the course of such desperate service, a great number of men must have been killed, and many died of dis∣temper. The island was in itself so barren, and Mons. de St. Croix had taken such effectual pre∣cautions to remove its produce, that the English army had neither fresh provision nor refreshments, except what was brought by sea from England. From thence, indeed, they were tolerably well sup∣plied with live cattle: they were also reinforced by one regiment from Portsmouth, and another from the island of Jersey. By the end of May a breach was made in the citadel; and notwithstanding the

The disputes between the clergy and the civil ad∣ministration of justice, far from being quieted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyal authority, seemed to derive fresh rancour from some late complaints exhibited against the Jesuits; a society which at this juncture incurred universal odium, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the intrigues and conspiracy which some of their members had conducted in the kingdom of Portugal. They were extremely un∣popular in France, not only on account of the doctrines which they taught and promulgated in their seminaries and writings, but also for their offi∣cious interfering in temporal concerns; and par∣ticularly for some frauds in commerce, of which they were loudly accused. They had carried on a considerable trade with the island of Martinique; and some of their vessels being taken by the Eng∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh cruisers, seized this pretence for stopping pay∣ment, in order to defraud their creditors: but they were cited before the tribunals of the kingdom, and compelled to do justice to those whom they had intended to injure. The issue of this prosecution was attended with new disgrace to the whole or∣der, and the people in general wished for their ex∣pulsion from France.

They moreover issued some severe edicts against the society; but the king, interposing in their be∣half, published an arret, suspending all proceedings against them for a twelvemonth. This the parlia∣ment agreed to register, on condition that it should continue in force no longer than the first of April: at the same time they directed the first president to represent in the strongest terms, to his majesty the ill consequences of protecting such a perni∣cious order; the more dangerous from their great number, which in France alone was computed to exceed twenty thousand.</P>

In the mean time, the hereditary prince having re∣ceived intelligence that the French garrison of Fritzlar was not prepared for an attack, he marched thither with a few battalions, in hope of carrying the place by a sudden assault with musquetry only: but he met with such a warm reception, that he was obliged to wait for the arrival of some cannon and mortars, which were plied with great viva∣city; and the garrison being destitute of artillery, colonel de Narbonnes their: commander, capitu∣lated on honourable terms, after having made a very gallant defence.

Baron Closen, who commanded the French troops on this occa∣sion, charged nine regiments of Hanoverians, Hes∣sians, and Brunswickers, at the head of his dra∣goons, with such impetuosity, just as they were entering a defile, that they were totally routed, with the loss of two thousand men either killed or taken, eighteen pair of colours, and twelve pieces of artillery. Major-general de Rhede fell in the action, and the rest of the detachment retired in tolerable order.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi∣nand re∣treats.</NOTE> After this disaster, the allies continued to retreat as the enemy advanced. They abandoned the siege of Ziegenhayn, from which they did not re∣tire without considerable loss. All the places they had lately reduced were now deserted. The siege of Cassel was raised; the army retired behind the Dymel, and prince Ferdinand established his head∣quarters at Neuhas near Paderborn. In conse∣quence of these motions, the French were again in possession of the whole landgraviate of Hesse-Cassel, masters of Gottingen and Munden in Hanover, and at liberty to penetrate into the heart of that electorate. The situation of the allies seemed the more critical, as the prince de Soubise was at the head of a second French army, cantoned on the Lower Rhine; and if he had heartily co-operated with the marechal de Broglio, there is no doubt but they might have terminated the war before the close of summer. It was, however, the interest of France to protract the war in Germany, until Eng∣land should be exhausted; and the g—of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of de∣tached parties.</NOTE> The progress of the French was retarded by the loss of a large magazine of hay, collected at Wesel on the Rhine, which was consumed by fire, not without suspicion that it was wilfully destroyed. The hereditary prince of Brunswick, at the head of a separate body, advanced to Nettelen, in the neigh∣bourhood of Munster, about the middle of May, to observe the motions of the army under Soubise, who ordered three different camps to be formed at Dusseldorff, Burich, and Rees, though part of his forces still remained in cantonment. The war was in the mean time carried on by detached parties, and skirmishes were fought with various success. The army of the duke de Broglio, having passed the Dymel about the latter end of June, drove general Sporcken from his post on the left of that river, with the loss of eight hundred men taken prisoners, nineteen pieces of cannon, four hundred horses, and two hundred waggons. After this ex∣ploit, the French made themselves masters of War∣burg, Paderborn, and Dringelbroen, and obliged prince Ferdinand to repass the Lippe on the second day of July. These successes, however, were over∣ballanced by the atchievements of detached par∣ties, which he sent forth from time to time to har∣rass them in their motions, and intercept their con∣veys of provision. On the thirteenth day of July, in the morning, general Luckner with his detach∣ment advanced to Salme, where the count de Cha∣bot

Other par∣ties destroyed the French convoys in the neigh∣bourhood of Cassel, and did such considerable da∣mage to the enemy, that they resolved to join the armies, and give battle to prince Ferdinand.</P>

The marquis of Granby maintained his position on the heights of Kirch-Denckern: lieu∣tenant-general Wutgenau, moving from the heath of Untrup, marched by his right, in order to ap∣proach the village of Kirch Denckern: the avenue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and posts on the little rivers Aast and Sultzbah were guarded by the piquets of the army. On the fifteenth day of July, in the evening, the army of Soubise, having struck their tents, advanced on the left of the allies, and dislodged the advanced posts of lord Granby, against whose corps their chief effort was directed. Prince Ferdinand now thought proper to make a new disposition. The marquis was directed to maintain his ground to the last ex∣tremity. Wutgenau was ordered to make a mo∣tion to the left, to block up the high road from Lipstadt to Ham, and to act in concert with the

Lieutenant-general Conway replaced the prince of Anhalt, be∣tween Illingen and Hohenover. The hereditary prince ordered lieutenant-general Bose to occupy the heights of Wambeln, leaving count Kilman∣segge on the side of Buderich. The greatest part of the artillery was distributed by count Shaum∣bourg Lippe on the front of the left. General Sporcken, who encamped with a separate body at Hortzfeld, was ordered to detach six squadrons, and as many battal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, over the Lippe, to sup∣port M. de Wutgenau, and to act with the rest as he should judge most effectual for the advantage of the whole. Lord Granby, being furiously attacked by the enemy, sustained a prodigious fire of artil∣lery and small arms, and with unshaken resolution withstood all their efforts until the arrival of Wutgenau; who, advancing on his left, and charg∣ing them in flank, obliged them to retire into the woods with precipitation: then he extended his right to Haus-Vilinghausen, and turned his left towards the high road of Ham, the defence of which place was his chief object. Prince Ferdi∣nand having learned from the prisoners that mare∣chal Broglio had decamped from Erwite at break of day, in order to join Soubise, and give battle to the allies, concluded that the strongest efforts would be made upon his l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft, and took his precau∣tions accordingly. He ordered general Howard to bring up the brigade of infantry commanded by

Colonel Grevendorsf was detached with two battalions to barricade and fortify the village of Kirch▪Denckern, and to be there sup∣ported, in case of necessity, by General Howard. Mean while, the enemy kept possession of some posts opposite to the picquets of the allied ar∣my, and the patroles skirmished all night. At three in the morning the whole French army ad∣vanced again to the attack on the side where Wut∣genau was posted, and a dreadful fire of cannon and musquetry was maintained on both sides for five hours, during which the enemy was not able to gain one inch of ground. About nine, prince Ferdinand receiving intimation that the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r design was to cannonade the camp of lord Granby from an opposite eminence, immediately ordered a body of troops to anticipate this operation by a vigorous charge. This movement proved decisive. The troops advanced with amazing intrepidity, and at∣tacked with such vigour as in a little time obliged the enemy to give way, and abandon the field in confusion. Their left, which still maintained a se∣vere cannonade on that side where the hereditary prince commanded, no sooner understood the mis∣carriage on their right than they desisted from the attack, and retreated in order. The le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the enemy was pursued as far as Hiltrup, about a league from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield of battle; but as the nature of the ground did not permit the cavalry to act, they s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tained the less damage in their retreat.

In other respects, the victory would have been attended with little advantage, had the enemy continued to act in concert, and avail themselves of their great su∣periority in point of number. But their generals were said to be actuated by motives of personal pique, and to have mutually thwarted the schemes of each other. Broglio, proud, warm, and enter∣prising, valued himself upon his military talents, and owed his command to the prevailing opinion that he was the best general in France. The prince de Soubise was deemed a better citizen than a soldier: generous, humane, and amiable in his private cha∣racter, he aspired not to military glory; but suf∣fered himself to be used as an instrument to gra∣tify the resentment of the marchioness de Pompa∣dour, who hated the marechal duke de Broglio.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soubise retreats to the Roer.</NOTE> Certain it is, after the action of Kirch Denckern, which the French denominate from the village of Fillinghausen, their two armies were disunited. Broglio marched back towards Cassel; and Soubise, retreating to Dortmund, passed the Roer; as if they had laid aside for that campaign all thoughts of acting further on the offensive. But his passage of the Roer was designed to secure a great number of barges coming down the Rhine, loaden with forage for his army; and, before he took this step, he sent off two large detachments to reinforce Brog∣lio. Having received his forage, he repassed both the Roer and the Lippe, and advanced as far as Dulmen; while Broglio, penetrating further into the electorate of Hanover, took possession of

Prince Ferdi∣nand, being greatly outnumbered, retired to Du∣molt, and called in most of his detachments. The French general encamped in his neighbourhood, on the heights of Neim, and many skirmishes en∣sued; in one of which prince Henry, brother to the hereditary prince of Brunswick, was mortally wounded. About the middle of August an advan∣tage was gained at Cassel by general Luckner, who attacked and routed a body of the enemy, from whom he took a considerable number of men and horses.</P>

This movement obliged the French ge∣neral to return with the greater part of his army: then prince Ferdinand, retreating to Paderborn, established his head-quarters at Buhne, from whence he extended his forces towards Hamelen. Broglio once more passed the Weser, encamped near Eim∣beck, and laid the whole country under contri∣bution. In the mean time, Soubise having esta∣blished his ovens at Dorsten, and garrisoned the place with one battalion, the hereditary prince found means to attack and reduce the town, to make prisoners of the garrison, to demolish the ovens, and destroy the magazines there provided: an exploit, in consequence of which the prince de Soubise retreated to the other side of the Lippe; but he soon repassed that river, and advanced again
<PB N="277" REF="2850"/>
towards Caeffelt, from whence his detachments<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> overspread all the northern parts of Westphalia. While prince Ferdinand lay encamped at Will∣hemsthall in the neighbourhood of Hamelen, and the hereditary prince at the head of a detachment scoured the open country of Hesse Cassel, the ma∣rechal Broglio made reprisals in the Hartz, where he reduced and demolished the strong castle of Schutzfels, and made the garrison prisoners of war. A detachment, commanded by his brother the count de Broglio, and prince Xavier of Saxony, having made a forced march, took possession of Wolfembuttle, and then invested Brunswick; but before they could reduce this city, the hereditary prince being joined by general Luckner, flew to the relief of his own capital. At his approach they abandoned their enterprize, and evacuated Wolfembuttle with such precipitation as to leave some of their cannon behind, and about five hun∣dred men, who were taken.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Embden and Os∣nabrug laid un∣der con∣tribution.</NOTE> Towards the end of September, a detachment from the army of Soubise, commanded by the mar∣quis de Conflans, appeared before Embden, which was garrisoned by two companies of English inva∣lids, who obrained an advantageous capitulation, and embarked for Bremen: then the French troops laid the town under contribution, and evacuated the place; but the boors of the country rising in arms, and sinking the pontoons on which the ene∣my had passed the river, the French general sent a second detachment, which brought off the first, after having dispersed and hanged some of the pea∣sants in terrorem.

A third made an attempt upon Bremen; but the inhabitants joining the gar∣rison, obliged the French to retreat with precipita∣tion; and they were afterwards reinforced by two battalions of the British legion, the better to secure the magazines deposited in that place for the use of the allied army. This period seems to have been altogether critical. Had Soubise reduced Bremen, passed the Weser, and cut off prince Fer∣dinand's communication with Stade, while Broglio co-operated with vigour in the countries of Hano∣ver and Brunswick, by prosecuting every measure which his superiority of numbers enabled him to take; in all probability the allied army would have been reduced to the necessity of demanding a capi∣tulation; but, as we have already observed, it was not the interest of France to terminate the war in this part of Germany.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The allies offer bat∣tle to Broglio at Eim∣beck.</NOTE> Broglio lay inactive at Eimbeck, without at∣tempting any thing of consequence; nor was he at all disturbed in his position until the beginning of November, when prince Ferdinand had formed a plan for attacking him suddenly, before he could call in his detachments; or, at least, to intercept and cut off a large body of fifteen battalions posted at Eschershausen, under the command of Mons. de Chabot. With this view he ordered the heredi∣tary prince and general Luckner, reinforced by the garrison of Wolfembuttle, to advance from their respective posts, so as to be in the neighbourhood

He sent general Hardenberg with a detachment to pass the Weser at Badenwerder, that he might at the ap∣pointed time take possession of a defile at Ame∣lunxhorn, on the other road from Eschershausen to Eimbeck. Having taken these precautions, he himself with the main body of the army passed the Weser on the fourth near Hastenbeck, and ad∣vanced towards Eschershausen. M. de Chabot no sooner understood that he had passed the river, than he began early in the morning of the fifth to retreat towards Eimbeck; but, when he approach∣ed Wickensen, he found the road possessed by a strong body of British grenadiers and Highlanders: for the marquis of Granby had gallantly forced the enemy's post at Cappelnhagen, and blocked up the defile by the hour appointed. Chabot, per∣ceiving himself intercepted, retreated immediate∣ly towards Eschershausen, and struck into the other road to Eimbeck, which general Hardenberg had been ordered to occupy: but in his march to Baden∣werder some of his pontoons were overturned, and this accident retarded him so long, that he did not reach the place appointed until seven in the morn∣ing; and by that time Chabot had passed the de∣file in his way to Eimbeck, where he arrived at noon, without further interruption. Thus the plan miscarried; and this will generally be the fate

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> of every scheme that depends upon a variety of in∣cidents. Prince Ferdinand, notwithstanding the disappointment, advanced to the French camp▪ which he found too strong to be attacked with any prospect of success. Then he resolved to turn their flank, as if he intended to cut off their com∣munication with Gottingen; a motion which he knew would either bring Broglio to an engage∣ment on equal terms, or oblige him to retreat. The last part of the alternative he chose to em∣brace, and on the ninth retired with his whole ar∣my. This was the last transaction of any conse∣quence that happened between the contend ng ar∣mies in Westphalia. Broglio quartered his army in Cassel, and that neighbourhood. The forces of Soubise were distributed at Dusseldorp, and along the Lower Rhine. The allies established their quarters at Hildersham, Munster, Hamelen, and Eimbeck.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inactivity of the Austrian and Prus∣sian ar∣mies in Saxony and Sile∣sia.</NOTE> The Austrian and Prussian armies remained quietly in their winter-quarters in Saxony and Si∣lesia, until the spring was far advanced. Whether they found it difficult to provide forage, or thought it more for their interest to remain on the defensive, and observe each other's motions, than to hazard any movement of consequence, we cannot pretend to determine. Certain it is, the generals on both sides were, by a long course of mutual hostilities, become perfectly well acquainted with the genius, manner, and resources of each other; while the forces that constituted both armies had attained

The king of P—had derived caution and circumspection from a re∣petition of miscarriages and disappointments. He knew too well the vigilance, activity, and fortitude of the Austrian general Laudohn, to hope he should acquire any material advantage from a sudden im∣petuosity of attack. The number of his forces was considerably diminished by the diseases of the camp, as well as by a succession of indecisive bat∣tles. His dominions were already half depopu∣lated by the draughts he had made to recruit his armies; whereas the countries possessed by his ene∣mies were much more capable to supply such con∣tinual drains. The stake which he hazarded was therefore the more important; and he plainly per∣ceived, that even a repetition of victory would complete his ruin. Besides, Laudohn had taken his measures so artfully, that he could not be at∣tacked with any prospect of advantage; and the Prussian monarch could not shift the scene into another country, without abandoning his maga∣zines and cities of refuge in Silesia. Such indeed was his situation, that he could not move, without exposing himself to loss or discomfiture. He there∣fore determined to maintain his ground, and act upon the defensive; and instructions to the same purpose were communicated to his brother prince Henry, whose army was cantoned in Saxony, in the neighbourhood of that commanded by count Daun the Austrian general.</P>

In the beginning of April the Prussian majors general Schenkendorff and Sy∣bourg, advancing with a body of troops from Gera towards Neustadt on the Orla, continued their march to Saalfield, where they attacked an Austrian detachment commanded by general Kleist, who was routed with considerable loss. They likewise drove a body of the army of the Empire from the village of Schwartz, which they had occupied with two battalions, as a post of importance. In this expedition the Prussians took several pieces of can∣non, colours, waggons loaded with baggage and ammunition, and above eleven hundred men, in∣cluding two and thirty officers. After this exploit, the Prussian generals sent a detachment to attack the corps under general Guasco near Plaune in Voightland, who was obliged to retire with loss, and abandon four pieces of cannon, with all his baggage. Other petty advantages of the same kind were obtained in the beginning of summer by the Prussian detachments; but the king in person undertook nothing of consequence in the field.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colberg invested by the Russians.</NOTE> In Pomerania the Swedes were not in motion till the month of August, when prince Henry, having received intelligence that they had begun to ad∣vance towards the Prussian territories, detached ge∣neral Stutterheim to reinforce colonel Belling in that country with a few battalions, at whose ap∣proach the enemy retreated. It was in the begin∣ning of the same month, that the army of the em∣pire advancing in Saxony as if they intended to at∣tack Leipsic, prince Henry sent general Seydlitz with a detachment of seven thousand men, who fell upon them with such impetuosity, that they were obliged to give way, and retreated with great pre∣cipitation to a considerable distance from the Prus∣sian cantonments, which they never afterwards pre∣sumed to approach. The Russian ministry, hav∣ing been long sensible of the inconveniencies to which their operations were subject from their great distance from the scene of action, resolved, if possi∣ble, to reduce Colberg, which would serve as a magazine and a key to Pomerania. For this pur∣pose, general Romanzoff was detached, in the month of July, with a considerable body of forces to invest that fortress by land, while it should be blocked up by sea by a strong squadron, in which an additional number of troops with the ar∣tillery and warlike stores were transported. This was joined by the Swedish fleet in August, and Ro∣manzoff began to canonnade the place; but, as he

The Swedes, at the same time, seemed to favour the operations of their allies. Their army in western Pomerania, having received a reinforcement, began to advance again to the Prussian territories, and skirmished with Stutterheim; but no action of consequence was hazarded on either side.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Russian detach∣ments penetrate into Sile∣sia.</NOTE> The main Russian army, commanded by Buttur∣lin, could not take the field till the season was far advanced. In May, however, a detachment ad∣vanced towards Silesia without artillery, and formed a camp at Bojanovo: another body established a considerable magazine at Posen; a third, under count Tottleben, penetrated into Pomerania in the beginning of June, and made a furious attack upon Belgarde, from whence he was repulsed with consi∣derable loss. After this miscarriage, he sent out detachments as far as the frontiers of the New Marche, where they took possession of Landsberg upon the Wartha. In the month of August, while the head-quarters of the Prussian monarch were at Strehlen, the Russian general Czernicheff advanced, with the van-guard of that army, to Wohlau; and the Cossacks, with other light troops, passing the Oder, ravaged the country in the neighbourhood of Jauer.

Yet, far from being abandoned by his courage and recollection, he had recourse to expedients, which seem to have frus∣trated the designs of his enemies. He detached a considerable body of forces into Poland under the command of general Platen, whose motions were conducted with such secrecy and expedition, that he had burned three Russian magazines in that kingdom, before the object of his march was known; and the great magazine at Posen narrowly escaped the same fate. Immediately after this at∣chievement, general Butturlin separated the main body of his army from the Austrians, and retreated towards Poland; yet he left general Czernicheff with a considerable body of forces to co-operate with Laudohn, who, about this juncture, distin∣guished himself by an extraordinary exploit▪ which proved very detrimental to the Prussian monarch's affairs.</P>

It was central in its situation, strongly for∣tified, and contained a great magazine of military stores and artillery. Laudohn formed a scheme for reducing it by surprize, and it succeeded be∣yond expectation. On the first day of October, at three in the morning, the troops selected for this service advanced to the attack in four different places, and, under the favour of a thick fog, not only approached, but even fixed their scaling lad∣ders, before they were perceived by the garrison, who scarce had time to fire a few cannon at the assailants. The contest, however, was maintained for some time with small arms, until a powder-ma∣gazine in one of the outworks blew up, and about six hundred men on both sides were destroyed by the explosion. The Austrians, taking advantage of the confusion occasioned by this accident, ad∣vanced to the body of the place, and bursting open the gates, entered the town without much opposi∣tion. At day-break they found themselves masters of the place; and the governor, lieutenant-general Zastrow, with all his garrison, amounting to three thousand men, were made prisoners. Thus Lau∣dohn, at the expence of about six hundred men, who fell in the attack, took above five times that number; and made himself master of a strong im∣portant fortress, in which he found a vast magazine of meal, and a numerous train of artillery. The king of Prussia could not but severely feel this stroke, which was equal to a defeat in the open

Im∣mediately before the king repaired to Breslau, he had the good fortune to detect a conspiracy, which was formed against his person by the baron de Warkotch, a man of considerable rank and for∣tune in Silesia, and one Francis Schmedt, a priest. Their intention was to seize the king when he should come forth unattended, and convey him to the Austrian camp: but whether they were coun∣tenanced in this scheme by the court of Vienna, is a question which hath not yet been determined. The discovery was made by one of the baron's do∣mestics, who▪ being charged with a letter from the baron to the ecclesiastic, and suspecting the contents, delivered it to the Prussian monarch. Thus the mystery was unravelled: a detachment was immediately sent to apprehend the baron, and seize all his papers. Both were accordingly secured; but he afterwards found means to escape through a window. His lady was, however, detained in cus∣tody. Schmedt having likewise consulted his safe∣ty by flight, the king caused them to be cited to appear by the twenty-first day of January, to an∣swer to the charge brought against them, on pain of forfeiting their lives and estates.

The captivity of an incendiary prince will generally stop the effusion of blood, and put an end to the horror and desolation of war; but the destruction of towns and magazines in∣volves the innocent in calamity, and extends the miseries of the human species: for the magazines, thus destroyed, are commonly repaired at the ex∣pence of the unhappy country into which the seat of war has been transferred.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colberg invested by the Russians.</NOTE> The great Russian army retreated beyond the Vistula; but the corps under Romanzoff still con∣tinued before Colberg, notwithstanding all the ef∣forts of the prince of Wurtemberg, whom the king of Prussia had sent to command his forces in Po∣merania. The blockade had for some time been converted to a regular siege; and colonel Haden, who commanded the garrison, made a very obstinate defence. In the beginning of October, the bois∣terous weather obliged the Swedish squadron to re∣tire. A Russian ship of the line was wrecked, and all the crew perished: their hospital ship was acci∣dentally set on fire and destroyed: in a word, the Russian fleet likewise withdrew, and returned to Cronstadt; and then the garrison of Colberg received a large supply of provision from Stetin. These circumstances concurring with the severity of the season, it was imagined, would compel even the Russians to quit the field, and at any rate render the operations of the siege impracticable; but Ro∣manzoff seemed to set the winter at defiance, and prosecuted his works with unabating vigour, until he reduced a small fort that commanded the har∣bour. By means of this acquisition he excluded the garrison of Colberg from all communication by sea; so that they were in danger of perishing by famine, when colonel Haden surrendered, on the seventeenth day of December. By this important conquest, it will be in the power of the Russian mi∣nistry to supply and reinforce their armies in Ger∣many by sea. In the mean time, the possession of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> Colberg secures to them all the eastern part of Po∣merania, where accordingly Romanzoff's forces are distributed for the winter; his own head quar∣ters being established at Stargart, about twenty miles from Stetin. Thus, the Russians have at length obtained an advantageous pass, through which they may deluge the northern parts of Ger∣many, and make an effectual settlement in the em∣pire, which has been the constant aim of the court of Petersburg, since, and even before the founda∣tion of that city by Peter Alexiowitz. In that case a certain p—will be the first to rue his own con∣duct, in kindling the flames of war in the bowels of his country; and the house of Austria will have cause to wish it had relied on its own internal strength, rather than have recourse to the assistance of such dangerous auxiliaries.</P>
<P>We shall conclude the foreign transactions of this year, with an incident that demonstrates the cautious regard with which the powers of Europe avoid every opportunity of giving umbrage to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incident relating to Malta.</NOTE> Ottoman Porte. In the course of the preceding year, a large Turkish ship of the line, called the Ottoman Crowne, was seized by the Christian-slaves on board, who rose upon the Turks, and, having defeated them, brought the ship into Malta; where, according to custom, the prize was divided among the captors. The Porte de∣manded the restitution of the ship in the most inso∣lent terms; and the knights of Malta, who are a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perpetual war with the infidels, treated this de∣mand with disdain. The grand signior, incensed at the refusal, sent a public man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to Naples by
<PB N="291" REF="2990"/>
the capuchins of Tunis, in which he bitterly com∣plained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> of the Maltese knights, and threatened their total extirpation; at the same time he began to equip a formidable fleet of ships and galleys: but as he caused large quantities of warlike stores to be conveyed by the Black Sea to the mouth of the Danube, and the report prevailed that he had lately concluded a treaty of alliance with the Prus∣sian monarch, certain powers suspected that he harboured some other design, under the pretext of an armament against Malta. The empress queen of Hungary, to avoid all occasion of giving um∣brage to the Porte, forbade all the knights of Malta residing in her dominions, to repair to the de∣fence of that island, in case it should be attacked: a circumstance that plainly evinces what regard even the most bigotted powers pay to the institu∣tions of religion, when they interfere with tempo∣ral interests. The French king acted on this oc∣casion, with more delicacy and discretion. He purchased the Turkish ship which had been taken, and sent it to Constantinople as a present to the sultan. It was protected in the voyage by the British cruisers; and the grand signior was pleased to signify that his resentment was appeased.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of a ne∣gociation for peace between the courts of Lon∣don and Versailles</NOTE> The most important transaction that distinguished this year, was a negociation for peace between Great Britain and France, which was brought upon the carpet at the request of the court of Versailles. We have already observed, that the powers at war had agreed to open a general congress at Augs∣burg; and the British plenipotentiaries were ac∣tually nominated at the court of London; when
<PB N="292" REF="3000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> the French king made advances towards a separate pacification with England, under the mediation of the Spanish monarch. The count d'Affry, ambas∣sador from France at the Hague, had several con∣ferences on this subject with general York, the British minister; but these proving abortive, and the issue of the congress being distant and uncer∣tain, the court of Versailles took an extraordinary step to effectuate an immediate peace with England. A memorial of his most Christian majesty was, in the month of March, transmitted by the hands of prince Gallitzin, the Russian ambassador at London, to Mr. secretary Pitt, with a letter from the Due de Choiseul the French minister, signi∣fying that the king of France hoped the frank and ingenuous manner in which he proposed to treat with his Britannic majesty, would banish all sus∣picion and mistrust from the negociation, and en∣gage the king of England to disclose his real senti∣ments, either with regard to the continuation of the war, or the re-establishment of peace. He likewise declared, that, with respect to the king of Prussia, his master's allies were determined to act at the future congress, according to the dictates of justice and good faith, sincerely disposed to promote the inte∣rests of humanity, and restore the peace of Europe. The French king, in his memorial, expressed his desire that the particular accommodation between France and England should be united with the general pacification of Europe; but, as the objects of the war between France and England were totally foreign to the disputes in Germany, he thought it would be necessary to agree with his
<PB N="293" REF="3010"/>
Britannic majesty upon certain principal points which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> should form the basis of their particular negociation. In order to avoid the delays which a minute and te∣dious discussion of particular circumstances might occasion, he proposed that the two crowns should remain in possession of what they should have con∣quered from each other in different parts of the world, at the following periods of time; in the East-Indies, on the first day of September in the present year; in the West-Indies and Africa, on the first of July; and in Europe, on the first of May: but, as these terms might be thought either too near or too remote; and the king of England might be of opinion that compensations should be made in whole, or in part, for the reciprocal con∣quests of the two crowns; he would willingly com∣mence a negociation on these subjects; his chief aim being to evince his hearty desire of removing all obstacles which might obstruct the salutary object of peace. These advances met with a favourable reception at the court of London. Mr. secretary Pitt wrote an immediate answer to the Duc de Choiseul, expressing his master's sincere desire to correspond with the pacific sentiments of his most Christian majesty. At the same time he declared, that the king of England was determined to sup∣port the interest of the Prussian monarch and his other allies, with the cordiality and efficacy of a sincere and faithful ally. This letter was accom∣panied with a memorial, in which his Britannic majesty acknowledged that the objects which oc∣casioned the war between England and France, were totally foreign from the disputes in Germany.
<PB N="294" REF="3020"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> He agreed that the two crowns should remain in▪ possession of the conquests they had made upon each other; but he objected to the dates prescribed, without proposing any other. Nevertheless, he declared he should be glad to see in London, a per∣son duly authorized by his most Christian majesty, to enter with the British ministers into a final dis∣cussion of these points, so essential to the interests of the two nations. Accordingly, in the course of the correspondence between the two secretaries, it was agreed that the sieur de Bussy, who had formerly resided in a public character at London, should be appointed minister, and repair to that court in or∣der to manage the negociation; while Mr. Stanley should act at Versailles in the same capacity. In the mean time several letters and memorials were inter∣changed between the two courts. It was in the month of May that Mr. Stanley crossed the sea from Dover to Calais, and at the same time M de Bussy arrived at London. His instructions were to adhere to the <HI>uti possidetis,</HI> as the basis of the ne∣gociation; to demand an explanation of his Britan∣nic majesty's sentiments touching the dates o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aeras at which that proposal should take place; to declare to the court of London, that, as the war between France and England was entirely detached from that which had broke out between the em¦press queen of Hungary and the king of Prussia, his most Christian majesty, excepting Wesel and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which belonged to the Queen, was at li∣berty to withdraw his troops from the city of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tingen, the landgraviate of Hesse, and the county of Hanau; and this evacuation should be made o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="295" REF="3030"/>
these conditions: The court of England should<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761▪</NOTE> give security that the army commanded by prince Ferdinand of Brunswic should be disbanded, and no longer serve against the allies of France; and his Britannic majesty should agree to such restitu∣tions on his part, as might be judged equivalent to this proposed evacuation. In the conferences which ensued at London and Versailles, the French ministers continued to press a specification of the aeras at which the two nations should be entitled to the <HI>uti possidetis;</HI> and the discussion of this point the English negociators avoided, until the citadel of Belleisle was reduced. Then the English ministry declared by a memorial, in explicit terms, that the first of July, September, and November next en∣suing, should be the established aeras, after which all the conquests that might be made on either side, should be mutually restored: but, to these aeras, the king of England agreed only on the following conditions: That every thing settled between the two crowns, in relation to their particular disputes, should be finally conclusive and obligatory, inde∣pendant of the negociations of Augsburg, for ad∣justing and terminating the contests of Germany; and that the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and France, or at least the prelimina∣ries, should be concluded, signed, and ratified by the first of August. With respect to the ulterior com∣pensations to be made, he desired to know the sentiments of the French king on that subject, pro∣mising then to declare himself with the utmost free∣dom and sincerity. The ministry of Versailles un∣dertook to deliver a memorial of propositions in
<PB N="296" REF="3040"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> form, to the court of London. In the mean time they gave Mr. Stanley to understand, that France would guarantee to England the possession of Ca∣nada, provided England would restore the island of Cape Breton, and confirm the right of French sub∣jects to take and cure fish in the Gulph of St. Lau∣rence, as well as on the banks, and in the island of Newfoundland: that the fortifications of Louis∣bourg should be demolished, and the harbour laid open: that Minorca should be restored to Great Britain, in exchange for the islands of Guadalupe and Mariegalante: that, with respect to the East-India affairs, the trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y concluded in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, between the sieur Godcheu and governor Saunders, should be confirmed; that in Africa, either Senegal or Goree should be restored to France; on which considera∣tion the French king should evacuate Gottingen, Hesse▪Cassel, and the county of Hanau; withdraw his troops to the Rhine and the Maine, and leave no forces in Germany, but a number equal to that of the enemy which should remain in the British army assembled in Westphalia. These articles were by no means agreeable to the English ministry, who, by the canal of Mr. Stanley, signified that his Britannic majesty would not restore the island of Cape Breton upon any condition whatsoever; and that France, in consideration of being allowed to fish on the banks of Newfoundland, should con∣sent to the demolition of Dunkirk. At the same time the proposal relating to Senegal and Goree was rejected. France complained that this demand concerning Dunkirk, was altogether foreign to the
<PB N="297" REF="3050"/>
negociation, which was founded on the <HI>uti possidetis;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> and looked like a design to take advantage of her ea∣gerness after peace: but she was in no condition to stand upon punctilio, and she considered the fortifi∣cations of Dunkirk, as indeed they were, a matter of too little consequence to frustrate the end of the negociation. In her memorial, dated on the fif∣teenth of July, she offered to cede and guarantee to England, all Canada without restriction, on these conditions: That the inhabitants of that country should enjoy liberty of conscience, and publicly profess their religion according to the rites of the catholic church: that such as are inclined to quit that country, might retire to the French colonies with all manner of freedom and safety; that they should be allowed to sell their estates, and transport their effects, without lett or molestation; and the English government should supply them with the means of conveyance at the most reasonable expence: that the limits of Canada and Louisiana should be ascertained in such manner, as to preclude all possibi∣lity of disputes on this subject, after peace should be re-established: that France should, as formerly, enjoy a share of the cod-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishery on the banks of Newfoundland; and as this privilege would be of no signification without some harbour for the protection of her fishermen, the king of England should restore Cape-Breton; in which case no forti∣fication of any kind should be raised in any part of that island: that France should restore to Great Britain the island of Minorca, and St. Philip's fort, with all the artillery found in it at the time of its reduction; in consideration of which, the king
<PB N="298" REF="3060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> of England should agree to the restitution of Gua∣dalupe and Mariegalante, in the same condition as when they were subdued: that, with respect to the neutral islands, Dominica, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Tobago, the two first should remain in posses∣sion of the Caribbee Indians, under the protection of France, according to the treaty concluded in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty: otherwise, that the four islands should remain absolutely neutral; or that only the two possessed by the Caribbees, should be declared neutral; while England takes possession of Tobago, and France occupies St. Lucia: that the East India companies of the two nations should mutually refrain from hos∣tilities, and the treaty mentioned above serve as the basis of a new pacification in Asia: that, as the French colonies in South America cannot subsist without negroes, which were furnished from the settlements of Senegal and Goree; and as these settlements bring no real advantage to the crown of Great Britain, one of them should be given up and guarantied to France by his Britannic majesty: that Belleisle, with its fortifications and artillery, should be restored; in consideration of which, the French king should withdraw his army from Germany, leav∣ing the navigation of the Maine free and open, and entirely evacuating the countries of Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, and Hanau; but these evacuations should be preceded by a cessation of hostilities be∣tween the two crowns, to take place on the day of the ratification of the preliminaries or articles of the de∣finitive treaty, not only in Germany, but in all other parts of the world: that no part of the army
<PB N="299" REF="3070"/>
commanded by prince Ferdinand of Brunswic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> should, on any pretence whatsoever, join the troops of the king of Prussia, or act offensively against the empress-queen or her allies; in like manner, as no body of French forces should assist the empress queen or her allies against the allies of Great Britain; that, after the evacuations proposed, the army commanded by the marechal de Broglio, should retire and occupy Frankfort on the Maine, while that under the marechal de Soubise should re∣treat to Wesel and Gueldres, on the Lower Rhine: that, as the king of Prussia's dominions on the Lower Rhine have been conquered for the empress-queen, and the towns are actually governed in her name, the French king could not undertake to eva∣cuate them, without the consent of that princess; but this point would be discussed in the congress of Augsburg; nevertheless, he would engage, when∣ever his Britannic majesty should think proper, to recall his national troops from Germany, to withdraw double the number of French troops from the Higher and Lower Rhine, and leave no more in those coun∣tries than should be proportioned to the number there retained in the pay of Great Britain: that all further conquests which may be made by either power be∣fore the ratification of the treaty, should be restored without difficulty or compensation: that the cap∣tures which England made by sea before the de∣claration of war, form an object of restitution which the French king would gladly submit to the justice of his Britannic majesty, and the determina∣tion of English courts of judicature, that subjects trading under the faith of treaties, and under the
<PB N="300" REF="3080"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> protection of the law of nations, ought not to suf∣fer from misunderstandings which may arise in the cabinets of princes, before these misunderstandings are publicly known: that the practice of declaring war was established by the law of nations, to make subjects acquainted with the quarrels of their so∣vereigns, that they might take care of their persons and effects; without which notice there would be no public safety, and every individual must be in fear and danger the moment he passes the confines of his own country. If these principles are incon∣testible, it will be proper to compare the time when the captures were made, with the date of the decla∣ration of war; and no prize taken anterior to this declaration can be deemed legal, without overturn∣ing the most sacred of human institutions. Should it be alledged they were made by way of reprisal, for hostilities which the French had committed in Ame∣rica, this objection was anticipated by observing that there was no sort of affinity between hostilities pre∣tended to be commenced at Fort du Quesne on the Ohio, and ships taken trading among the islands of the West Indies: that such hostilities might be the motives of declaring war; but the effects could not take place before that declaration was publish∣ed; and it would be unjust to aggrieve innocent individuals, ignorant of the facts and circumstances of remote hostilities which have kindled the flames of a general war between two nations. Moved by these considerations, the French king demanded an indemnification for his subjects, for the losses they had sustained before the war commenced, withou pretending to reclaim his own ships of war take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="301" REF="3090"/>
before that declaration. Finally, he offered to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> guarantee the succession of the present royal family to the throne of Great Britain; and proposed, that immediately after the ratification of the peace, the prisoners on both sides should be set at liberty, and re-conveyed to their own country without ransom. Together with this memorial, monsieur de Bussy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorial relating to Spain.</NOTE> delivered to the English ministry, another of a very singular nature, importing, that the disputes sub∣sisting between Spain and England gave his most Christian majesty cause to apprehend a new war in Europe and America, unless they could be now adjusted: that the Spanish monarch had commu∣nicated to him the three points of discussion, namely, the restitution of some ships taken in the course of the present war, under Spanish colours; the liberty claimed by the Spanish nation to fish on the banks of Newfoundland; and the destruction of the set∣tlements made by the English on the Spanish ter∣ritories in the Bay of Honduras. Besides these points, the court of Madrid had lately given the French king to understand, that he had pretensions to the neutral islands, which he would not fail to explain upon a proper occasion. His most Chri∣stian▪majesty, therefore, passionately desired that these differences might be amicably terminated; and that the king of Spain should be invited to guarantee the treaty between the two crowns; be∣cause, should they kindle up a new war, he should be obliged to perform his engagements to his al∣lies. Whether this remonstrance was an expedient calculated to preponderate against the demand with respect to the demolition of Dunkirk, or really the
<PB N="302" REF="3100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> effect of the French king's earnest desire to esta∣blish peace on the most solid foundation, we can∣not pretend to determine. Perhaps, according to the opinion of some politicians, it was artfully thrown in as an obstacle to the peace, which the court of Versailles never sincerely desired, or at least was now rendered unnecessary by a more in∣timate connection with Spain. Certain it is, the ministers of France had long been employing all their art and influence to inspire the Spanish mo∣narch with jealousy at the growing power of Great-Britain, her absolute empire at sea, and her exten∣sive conquests in America; and it is equally certain that these intrigues, at the long run, answered the end proposed. The two French memorials were accompanied by a third notification, signifying, that the empress-queen had consented to a particular peace between France and England, on these terms, and these only: That France should, for her benefit, keep possession of the countries belonging to the king of Prussia: that the king of Great Britain, elector of Hanover, should afford no longer any assistance, either in troops or subsidies, to the Prus∣sian monarch, in like manner as France should be restricted with respect to the empress-queen and her allies. If these insinuations were intended to defeat the declared purpose of the negociation, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected with dis∣dain by the British ministry.</NOTE> could not have been better contrived. The court of London received them with disdain, as insults upon the dignity and good faith of Great Britain. Mr. Secretary Pitt, in a letter to Mr. Bussy, de∣clared his master would not suffer the disputes with Spain, to be intermingled in any shape in the ne∣gociation
<PB N="303" REF="3110"/>
for peace; that the bare mention of such<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> an idea would be considered as an affront; and that the memorial relating to the king of Prussia could not be admitted without derogating from the honour of Great Britain, and that inviolable fidelity with which the king of England was determined to fulfil his engagements towards his allies. A memorial to the same purpose was transmitted to the court of Versailles, couched in such high terms, as could not fail to give umbrage to a power re∣markable for its pride and arrogance. Had the French king been insincere in his professions, he was now furnished with the fairest pretexts for breaking off the negociation. England in her demand relating to Dunkirk, had undoubtedly re∣ceded from the first agreement of treating on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti possidetis:</HI> she had rejected, with disdain, the sole condition on which the allies of Lewis had agreed to a separate peace between France and Great Britain: she had refused with a mixture of indig∣nation and contempt, the memorial relating to the disputes with Spain; and Belleisle being taken, France had nothing farther to fear from that quar∣ter. This therefore was the juncture at which the ministry of Versailles might have broke off the conferences, without affording any just handle for impeaching their sincerity. Yet this step they carefully avoided. To the last proposals of Great-Britain, they answered by an ultimatum, in which they made new concessions. They even conde∣scended to make an apology for having proposed a discussion of the points in dispute with Spain; and the conde de Fuentes, who resided as ambassador

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> from Spain at the court of London, delivered to Mr. Pitt, by order of his master, such an explana∣tion of that memorial, as seemed well adapted to remove any unfavourable impression that might have been produced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Note from the Spanish am∣bassador to Mr. Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>"The most Christian king, who sincerely wishes that the peace now under considera∣tion between France and Eng∣land, may be rendered of equal utility and duration, communicated, in the begin∣ning, his intentions to my master, a expressing the plea∣sure with which he seized that opportunity to demonstrate his respectful sense of the re∣peated offers his catholic ma∣jesty had made both to him and England, in order to fa∣cilitate a proper and perma∣nent reconciliation.</P>

<P>"These proceedings of his most Christian majesty could not but infinitely oblige the king my master, who enter∣tained an uniformity of senti∣ments, ever desirous to fulfil, by the most distinguished cor∣respondence, all the engage∣ments of consanguinity and mutual interest, by which the two monarchs are united; especially as he discovered in the intentions of the king of France, that humanity and greatness of mind so peculiar to him, in seeking to render the peace as permanent as the vicissitude of human affairs would permit.</P>
<P>"With the same candour and sincerity the king my master acquainted his most Christian majesty, that he could wish the king of Great Britain had made no difficulty in agreeing to the guarantee connected with the conside∣ration of the grievances sub∣sisting between Spain and England; having all the rea∣son in the world to believe that his Britannic majesty was equally disposed to ter∣minate them in an amicable manner, according to the laws of reason and justice. This intimation from my ma∣ster, induced the king of France to communicate to his Britannic majesty the pu∣rity of his intentions for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-establishment of peace, see∣ing, in proposing the guaran∣tee of Spain, he demonstrates his sincere desire to see those interests compromised, which may one day re-kindle the fames of war, which all par∣ties are now endeavouring to distinguish.</P>
<P>"If the intentions of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christian majesty, and the king my master, are not both replete with good faith, my master flatters himself that his Britannic shajesty will do him the justice to believe his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ws in particular were strictly so; for, had they re∣ferred to any other aim, his Catholic majesty, consulting his own greatness, would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke in his own person, ac∣cording to the dignity of his crown.</P>

But these remon∣strances<NOTE PLACE="marg">Final ar∣ticles a∣greed to by Eng∣land.</NOTE> had no effect upon the British ministry, which in the latter end of August transmitted the following articles to Versailles, in answer to the ul∣timatum of France. "—I. The king of Great Britain still insists upon the entire and total cession of Ca∣nada and its dependencies, without any limits or exceptions whatsoever; as also upon the full and final cession of Cape Breton, and all the other islands n the gulph of St. Laurence. Canada, according to the line of its limits traced by the marquis of Vaudrueil himself, when he, as governor-general, surrendered that province, by capitulation, to the English general Amherst, comprehends on one side, the lakes Huron, Michigan, and that called Superior; and the said line, drawn from the Red lake, embraces by a winding course the river Oua∣bache to its junction with the Ohio; from thence extending along this last river, inclusively to its confluence with the Mississippi. According to this definition of the limits by the French governor, the king reclaims the cession of Canada, a province which the court of France have offered a-new in its ultimatum to cede to his Britannic majesty, in the most extensive form, declared in the memorial of the proposals of peace dated on the thirteenth of July. With respect to the public profession and exercise of the Roman-catholic religion in Canada, his Britannic majesty will indulge his new subjects with that liberty, to be enjoyed withoutinterruption or molestation; and the French inhabitants or others who have been subject to the most Christian king in that country, shall have entire freedom and op∣portunity

As for the line drawn from Rio Perdido, contained in a notification delivered by monsieur de Bussy, on the eighteenth day of August concerning the limits of Louisiana, his majesty cannot but reject such an unexpected proposal, as altogether inadmissible on these accounts: The said line, under colour of fixing the limits of Loui∣siana, includes in that province extensive countries, which, with the posts and forts that command them, the marquis de Vaudreuil hath surrendered, by the most solemn capitulation, to his Britannick majesty, under the definition of Canada; of consequence, however contentious the respective pretensions of the two crowns might have been before the war, particularly with respect to the course of the Ohio, and the territories adjacent, all the contending titles are, since the surrender of Canada, and the line of its limits traced by the marquis de Vaudreuil, united, and without contradiction, become valid, in confirming to Great Britain the possession of these countries, together with the other parts of Canada. The line proposed for ascertaining the limits of Louisiana cannot be admitted, because it would comprehend on the side of Carolina, very extensive countries and numerous nations, which have always been considered as under the protection

of Utrecht, upon the said district of Newfound∣land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1761.</NOTE> With respect to the ulterior demand which his Christian majesty has made that his subjects may be allowed to fish in the gulph of St. Lau∣rence, and there enjoy a harbour without fortifi∣cations, subject to the inspection of England, as proposed by the duke of Choiseul, in his confe∣rence on that subject with Mr. Stanley, which har∣bour shall simply serve as a shelter to the French fishing vessels in those seas; the king, in order to convince his most Christian majesty, and all man∣kind, of his sincere desire after peace, will consent to allow the French subjects to fish in the gulph of St. Laurence, on this express condition; namely, That the said subjects of France shall abstain from that particular fishery upon all the coasts belonging to Great Britain, either of the continent, or of the islands situated in the said gulph of St. Laurence, which fishery, the possessors only of the said coasts have constantly enjoyed, and always exercised, ex∣cepting nevertheless the privilege granted by the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, to the subjects of France, to take and cure cod in a cer∣tain specified part upon the coast of Newfoundland, which privilege it is proposed shall be renewed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance, as mentioned above. The king will con∣sent to cede to his most Christian majesty, the island of St. Peter, with its harbour; which island, in respect to that part of Newfoundland lying be∣tween the bay of Placentia and the bay of For∣tune, is situated west, south-west, its harbour open∣ing to the north▪east, the interior part of which harbour is called Bourguay: the island of St. Peter,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> which the king is willing to cede, is separated by a small strait from another island, known by the name of Maquelon, or Michelon, to the northward of the said island of St. Peter. But, to the cession of this island, as above, the king will fix four in∣dispensible conditions. 1. France shall not, under any pretext or denomination whatever, build forti∣fications in the said isl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, or its harbour, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> main∣tain troops, nor have any military establish∣ment whatever upon it. 2. The said island and harbour shall serve as shelter only to the fishing vessels of the French nation; and France shall not be at liberty to share the said convenience of shelter with the fishing, or other vessels of any other nation whatsoever. 3. The possession of the island of St. Peter, as above, shall not be deemed in any case to transfer, attribute, or share, in any manner, the trust, right, or privilege of fishing and drying cod in any other part of the coasts of Newfoundland, beyond the district ex∣presly articled and fixed for that purpose, by the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht; that is to say, "A loco Cap Bonavista nuncupato, usque ad extremitatem ejusdem insulae septentrio∣nalem, indique ad latus occidentale recurren∣do, usque ad locum Pointe-Riche appellatum <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the place called Cape Bonavista, to the nor∣thern extremity of the said island, and thence running westerly to the place deno∣minated Pointe-Riche.</NOTE>." 4. By virtue of the cession of the said island, as above, an English commissary shall be at liberty to reside upon the spot; and the commander of the

British squadron at Newfoundland may, from time<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> to time, visit the said island and harbour of St. Peter, to see that the above specified stipulations be duly observed.—The king consents to restore to his most Christian majesty, 1. The important con∣quest of Belleisle, with the artillery, &amp;c. found therein at the reduction of the said island. 2. His majesty consents to restore to the most Christian king, the fertile and opulent island of Guadalupe, with that of Mariegalante, and the artillery, &amp;c. there found, at the conquest of the said islands. The island of Minorca, with St. Philip's fort, shall be restored to his Britannic majesty, in the same condition, including the artillery, &amp;c. as when at∣tacked and taken. As to the restitution and eva∣cuation of the conquests made by France upon any of the king's allies in Germany, particularly Wesel, and the other places and territories of the king of Prussia, his majesty still insists upon what is de∣manded in relation to that affair, in the seventh ar∣ticle of the ultimatum of England; it being always understood, that all the places belonging to the king's allies▪ in Germany, shall be restored, with the artillery, &amp;c. found in them at the time of their reduction. With respect to the succours to be fur∣nished by the crown of Great Britain to his Prussian majesty, as an auxiliary, after the ratification of the separate peace between Great Britain and France, his majesty pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sists in the same unshaken resolution which he has declared from the first opening of the present negociation, that he will not cease to suc∣cour constantly his ally the king of Prussia, with efficacy and good faith, in order to attain the salu∣tary
<PB N="312" REF="3200"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1761.</NOTE> aim of a general pacification in Germany. In these sentiments, his majesty, far from having pro∣posed that France shall be at liberty to send armies into Silesia, "without being limited to the number stipulated in her actual engagements with the court of Vienna," a proposal to be found in no part of the ultimatum of England, he hath only declared, as the thirteenth article of the said ultimatum shews, that Great Britain and France shall be at liberty to support, as auxil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aries, their respective allies, in the particular dispute for the recovery of Silesia, ac∣cording to the engagements which each crown has contracted. The king declares, at the same time, that he has neither the intention nor the power to forbid and inhibit any foreign troops from entering into the service and the pay of the king of Prussia, howsoever disposed his majesty might be to consent that he shall not furnish, but in subsidies only, the succours which Great Britain shall think proper, in conformity with her engagements, to afford his Prussian majesty. With respect to the prizes taken after the commencement of hostilities, though be∣fore the formality of declaring war, the king per∣sists in his opinion, that such a demand on the part of France, is neither just nor defensible, according to the most incontestible principles of the laws of war and of nations. As to the evacuation of Ostend and Nieuport, the king cannot help referring to the motives sounded on the most express and irrevoc∣able stipulations in the most solemn treaties, speci∣fied in the eleventh article of the ultimatum of Great Britain, and to his declaration relating to that subject; and his majesty confides in the good faith
<PB N="313" REF="3210"/>
of the declaration made on the part of his most<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> majesty, in the eleventh article of the ul∣timatum of France, namely, that it never was the intention of his most Christian majesty to keep pos∣session of those places after the re-establishment of peace. With respect to the cessation of hostilities, the king pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sists entirely in the sentiments expressed in the twelfth article of the British ultimatum. As to the concerns of the French East India company, re∣ference must be had to the ninth article of the ulti∣matum of England, with respect to which there seems to be no disagreement. In regard to the pri∣soners of war, the two crowns seem to be entirely agreed.—By this answer the court of France must perceive the rectitude of the king's intentions, as well as the moderation he shews in promoting the means of reconciliation with his most Christian majesty."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Final re∣ply of France to the an∣swer of Great Britain.</NOTE> This answer, couched in such a peremptory stile as could not but mortify the pride of France, might have been deemed another sufficient excuse for breaking off the negociation, had the court of Ver∣sailles wanted nothing more than a specious pretext for this purpose: but, after several fruitless con∣ferences between the duke de Choiseul and Mr. Stanley, the Brench ministry thought proper to make further concessions, in a new memorial to the court of London, dated on the ninth day of Sep∣tember. In this paper the French king, after the preamble, declaring, that in case the negociation should not succeed, all the concessions made in the course of it should be null and of no effect, pro∣ceeds to this purpose: "The king has said in his first memorial of proposals, as well as in his ultima∣tum,
<PB N="314" REF="3220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> that he would cede and guarantee to Eng∣land the possession of Canada, in the most exten∣sive form; his majesty repeats that offer; and even without discussing the line of limits traced in a chart or map presented by Mr. Stanley; as that line de∣manded by England is doubtless the most exten∣sive form that can be given to the cession, the king is willing to grant it, without further question. His majesty had affixed four conditions to his guaran∣tee: and to these England does not seem averse: the king only thinks the term of one year too short for the emigration of the French and the sale of their effects; and desires it may be protracted to two years, or eighteen months at least. As the court of England has, in the first article of its an∣swer relating to the entire and total cession, of Ca∣nada, as agreed upon between the two courts, added the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>dependencies,</HI> it will be necessary to explain what is meant by the word <HI>dependencies,</HI> that the cession may not produce disputes in the sequel. The first paragraph concerning the limits of Louisiana, con∣tained in the second article of England's answer, is allowed by France: the second paragraph is neither just nor clearly expressed; it is proposed therefore that it shall be definitively explained in the following terms: "The intermediate Indian nations, situated between the lakes and the Mississippi, within the line described, shall be neutral and independent, under the protection of the king of France; and those without the line, on the side of the English possessions, shall also be neutral and independent, under the protection of the king of England. The English traders shall not be allowed to visit the In∣dia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="315" REF="3230"/>
nations on either side of the line; but the said<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> nations shall not be abridged of the liberty which they have hitherto enjoyed of trafficking with both French and English." Although France is very sen∣sible how contrary it is to the views of reconcilia∣tion, for the party that cedes to propose to the party which has conquered, and means to preserve its conquests, the cession of countries which are not very well known; although this form of proceeding demanded by England, is without doubt subject to numberless difficulties, nevertheless, the king, in order to demonstrate his readiness to embrace every temperament tending to reconcile the two courts, freely declares to England, that he will guarantee to that crown the possession of Senegal and Goree, provided England will guarantee to France the pos∣session of her settlements at Anamaboe and Acra. The fourth article of the answer comprehends seve∣ral objects, and each enquires a particular explana∣tion. England still joins together the liberty of fishing on part of the island of Newfoundland, sti∣pulated to France in the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, with the ninth article of the same treaty, relating to the demolition of Dunkirk. The fourth and last answer which shall be given to Eng∣land on this head, is, that these two stipulations in treaty of Utrecht, have no other affinity, one with another, but that of their being both comprised in the same treaty; and that the concession ex∣plained in favour of the French, in the thirteenth article of that treaty, is a compensation for the cession of Newfoundland and Annapolis Royal, made on the part of France to England, by the
<PB N="316" REF="3240"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> twelfth and thirteenth articles of the same treaty. But that the two courts may come to a right un∣derstanding on this subject, and in order to facilitate the peace, the king consents to demolish the works which have been made for the defence of the har∣bour of Dunkirk since the beginning of that war, to fill up the bason which would contain ships of war, and destroy the buildings belonging to the rope-work; but, at the same time, his majesty will allow the merchant-harbour, which cannot receive even a frigate, to remain for the mutual advantage of England and France. He will engage that there shall be no maritime, military establishment in that sea-port; but he will leave the wet ditch or lunette round the place, which was made for the salubrity of the air and the health of the inhabitants. As to the fisning on the banks of Newfoundland, the king expects that the twelfth article in the treaty of Utrecht shall be confirmed. In regard to the con∣dition proposed by England, concerning the li∣berty of fishing allowed to belong to the French, in the gulph of St. Laurence, France agrees, that, ex∣clusive of the part of Newfoundland prescribed in the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, the French, except in case of accident, shall not come upon the coasts belonging to England▪ in the gulph of St. Laurence, either to dry their fish or spread their ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; but▪ bating these two exceptions, the French shall be at liberty to fish without molesta∣tion, in eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y part of the said gulph of St. Lau∣rence. As to the cession of the island of St. Peter, the smallness of that island, and its situation so near Placentia, give the king reason to believe that such
<PB N="317" REF="3250"/>
a shelter would be altogether illusive, and serve ra∣ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 176</NOTE> to create disputes between the two nations, than facilitate the fishery of the French subjects. The king had demanded of England the island of Cape Breton or St. John; he had even restricted himself to the inconsiderable island of Canceau; he now repeats the same proposal to his Britannic ma∣jesty; or, if the king of England, for reasons un∣known in France, cannot agree to the cession of Canceau; it is proposed he shall add to the island of St. Peter, the cession of the island of Maquelon, or Michelon, two islands which, joined together, do not exceed three leagues in extent. Inconsider∣able as these settlements are, and though, properly speaking, they form but one island, yet the king will accept of them, and even impose upon himself this condition▪ That there shall not be in either of these islands, nor in Canceau, provided England should part with this last, any military establishment: France will only maintain a guard of fifty men to support the execution of the police, which it will be necessary to maintain in those islands. The king will, as much as possible, considering the weakness of this guard, prevent all foreign vessels, even the English themselves, from going ashore on those islands. France does not pretend to fish and dry cod on the coast of Newfoundland, in any other way but according to the stipulation in the thir∣teenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, provided it be understood that the French have liberty to take and dry their fish on the coast of St. Peter and Michelon. Finally, the king agrees that an Eng∣lish commissary shall reside in the said islands, to
<PB N="318" REF="3260"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> see that the conditions stipulated in the treaty shall be punctually fulfilled. The division of the four neutral islands between the two courts, ought to be specified in the preliminaries: France agrees to any division of these islands that shall be proposed by England, provided the island of St. Lucie shall be declared part of the share assigned to France. The king, without staying to dispute particulars, con∣sents to the sixth and seventh articles, relating to the restitution of Guadalupe, Marigalante, Belleisle, and Minorca. As to the eighth article, relating to the evacuation of places in Germany, the king re∣fers to the seventh article of the ultimatum. It is not in his power to evacuate the countries belonging to his ally the empress-queen. The ninth article of England's answer requires explanation; for it is couched in such a manner, that the sense of it is not easily understood: it supposes engagements between the king and the empress, and between England and Prussia, which are not mutually known to the two courts of Versailles and London. It is not ima∣gined in France, that the king of England has not influence to prevent the allies of his crown, such as the sovereigns of Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, and Bruns∣wic, from joining their troops to those of the king of Prussia; but, without launching into useless dis∣cussions, the king, though determined, for the sake of peace, to make the most considerable sacrifices, is at the same time irrevocably resolved, to grant nothing in the future treaty of peace, but what shall be conformable to the stipulations by which he is engaged with his allies. It is with ▪their consent and concurrence that the king, in relation to the
<PB N="319" REF="3270"/>
war of Westphalia, proposed to England the tenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> article of the memorial, containing his majesty's proposals, and the seventh and thirteenth articles of the ultimatum of France. The king adheres to these three articles, in answer to the eighth and ninth articles in the answer of England; resolved, nevertheless, to treat upon any new proposals of England, relative to those objects; proposals which shall be communicated to the king's allies, and ac∣cepted by his majesty, with the consent of the em∣press, provided they shall not be contrary to the en∣gagements subsisting between him and that prin∣cess.—France is still of opinion, that the king's proposals, relating to the prizes taken from his sub∣jects before the declaration of war, are so just, that he is obliged to support them, and refers himself on that head, to the twelfth article of his proposals. The king, after the signing of the treaty, or even of the preliminaries, will deliver to the king of Eng∣land a paper signed with his own hand, containing a declaration, that it never was his intention to unite the towns of Ostend and Nieuport to his do∣minions. France will agree to the terms proposed for a cessation of hostilities, provided they are such as cannot be disadvantageous to either crown. France adopts the negociation between the East In∣dia companies of the two nations, on condition that it shall be terminated at the same time as that of the two crowns; for this purpose, they shall name their commissioners, and begin their negociation without loss of time. The fourteenth article, re∣lating to the exchange of prisoners, will meet with no difficulty: but the court of England will do
<PB N="320" REF="3280"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> Justice to the considerable advances made by France in this memorial, in order to facilitate a reconcilia∣tion between the two crowns.—To this memo∣rial, which was delivered on the thirteenth day of September, the British ministry deigned not to make the least reply. Mr. Stanley was recalled from Paris, and the French minister returned to his own country; thus the negociation was broke off, and the events of war were left to the determination of fortune.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflec∣tions up∣on the negocia∣tion.</NOTE> If we consider the mortifications which France digested in silence, and the sacrifices she offered to make for the re-establishment of peace; that as soon as she understood how deeply the court of London resented her mentioning the Spanish claims, she dropped that subject entirely; that she ceded all Canada, according to the limits prescribed by the English government, together with the island of Cape Breton, and the settlements of Senegal and Goree on the coast of Africa; that she acccepted of the privilege granted to her subjects, of fishing in the gulph of St. Laurence, upon the mortifying terms which England proposed; that she acquiesced in the demolition of Dunkirk; agreed to restore Minorca; to evacuate Nieuport and Ostend; and to leave the affairs of the East India company to the discussion of commissaries; we can hardly doubt the sincerity of her advances. On the other hand, if we reflect upon the terms offered by England, we shall find equal cause for astonishment and con∣cern. The war was expresly undertaken with a view to the security of the British settlements in North America, exposed to the incroachments of
<PB N="321" REF="3290"/>
the French, and to the inroads of the Indians, ac∣tuated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> by French influence. In the prosecution of the war, France was deprived of all Canada, and their influence of course extinguished through all the Indian nations, inhabiting or bordering on that vast country. The whole extent of the lakes, together with the course of the river St. Laurence, including the islands situated in the gulph of St. Laurence, were united to the British dominion. Nothing now remained but the conquest of Louisiana, to confirm the security of the English colonies beyond all fear of alarm, to render all the Indian nations of N. America intirely dependant on the British govern∣ment, and to engross the whole fur-trade of that immense continent. These purposes can never be answered while the French continue to have access by the Mississippi, to the inland parts of America. The colony of Louisiana, which at the commence∣ment of the war was weak and inconsiderable, and might have been reduced by a handful of troops, without interfering with any other capital opera∣tion, is now considerably strengthened and rein∣forced; and, no doubt, will every day encrease in wealth, extent, and number of people. By this avenue, our enterprising neighbours can penetrate to the back of all our settlements; rival our traders in the commerce of the country, by supplying the natives with necessaries cheaper than they can be afforded by the subjects of Great Britain; prosecute the arts of insinuation, and maintain their ascen∣dency in such a manner as to be always able to in∣fligate the remote Indians to fall occasionally upon the British colonies. From these considerations the
<PB N="322" REF="3300"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> reader may judge of the importance of Louisiana, which hath been left unattempted by the arms of Great Britain; and so tamely overlooked in the course of the negociation. The fishery in the gulph of St. Laurence, and on the banks of Newfound∣land, constituted one great source of wealth to France, and was undoubtedly her chief nursery for seamen; consequently the loss of it must have been severely felt in that nation: but the English m—y voluntarily offered to readmit her to a participation of this advantage, which, we will ven∣ture to say, was more than equivalent to all that she forfeited by the entire cession of Canada. The produce of Guadelupe is more than three times the value of what Canada adds to the wealth of Great Britain; yet the crown of E—agreed without hesitation to restore this opulent and important ac∣quisition. If such essential sacrifices were made on both sides, what then obstructed the pacification?—The French king declared he could not give up Wesel in Germany, which he had garrisoned in the name of the empress queen; a place which the king of Prussia had of himself abandoned: and the British government refused to restore those mer∣chant-ships which had been taken before the decla∣ration of war. It must be allowed, therefore, tha E—, rather than make restitution of a few hun¦dred thousand pounds plundered from the subject of France, while they traded secure on the faith o treaties, chose to prosecute the war, at the annua expence of twelve millions; or that this enormou charge, together with the expence of British blood and the risque of fortune's inconstancy, was a sacri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="323" REF="3310"/>
made to the interest of a German ally, who had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> already drained so much from the nation, which his friendship or animosity could not possibly either succour or affect.—It may be asked, if the French king was in reality so earnestly desirous of peace, why did not he throw these two inconsiderable ar∣ticles into the scale, with so many concessions of seemingly greater importance? The answer is ob∣vious. The progress of the English conquests, and the imperative manner in which they dictated the terms of peace, had, by this time, effectually ar∣roused the jealousy and disgust of the court of Ma∣drid, which being moreover convinced of the French king's moderation, offered to supply him with pecuniary succours; and these were all that he wanted to maintain a war in Germany, by which he well knew Great Britain would be in a few years utterly impoverished. In that case he foresaw England would be exposed to a new war with Spain, which could not fail to encrease her incumbrances; and that, in the prosecution of such accumulated hosti∣lities against her, he should probably recover some of the territories she had subdued.—That this was not meer conjecture appeared from the conduct of Spain, which, from this period, seemed to provoke a rupture with Great Britain. In accounting for the conduct of princes, we must not always look for national motives. The ties of consanguinity, or other private connections, have not unfrequently preponderated against the interest of a whole king∣dom. Perhaps the Spanish monarch was affected by this kind of influence. Considering the com∣mercial benefits which the subjects of that mo∣narchy
<PB N="324" REF="3320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> derived from a neutrality, while France and England were engaged in a war; considering the powerful navy of Great Britain, with which the ocean was overspread; the catholic king could not, with any regard to the advantage or safety of his subjects, engage in hostilities with England, un∣less he either believed she actually affected despo∣tism by sea, or hoped her finances were already so exhausted, that in a little time she must truckle to the additional power of France, reinforced by Spain; and in that case he should be able to vindi∣cate by force those pretensions which he never could establish by dint of negociation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Pitt resigns the seals.</NOTE> Mr. Pitt having noted in the Catholic king's conduct many flagrant instances of partiality, in favour of the enemies of Great Britain; and re∣ceived intimation that a private treaty was lately concluded between the courts of Versailles and Madrid; is said to have expatiated upon these par∣ticulars in council; to have proposed that an arma∣ment should immediately proceed to the Mediter∣ranean, and strike some stroke of importance, with∣out further formality, in case the ministry of Spain should refuse to give instant satisfaction to the court of Great Britain. He observed that such a spirited measure would either intimidate the court of Ma∣drid into compliance, so as to detach it entirely from the interest of France, or oblige them to hazard their homeward bound flota, loaden with treasure, to the chance of being taken by the En∣glish cruisers; as well as to expose their sea ports to the operations of the British armament, before they could be put in a proper posture of defence.
<PB N="325" REF="3330"/>
He declared that should his proposal be rejected or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> postponed, he would resign his employment, and withdraw himself from his majesty's councils; and the same declaration was made by the earl Temple, after he had harangued in support of the secretary's advice. The other members considered this pro∣posal as a delicate step not to be hazarded in the present conjuncture. The Spanish king's partiality in favour of France was at best but doubtful, and the contents of the late treaty between the houses of Bourbon were altogether unknown. When one state has cause of complaint or suspicion against another, the law of nations, and of reason, pre∣scribes, that recourse should be first had to ex∣postulation and demands of satisfaction. When these are refused, the power aggrieved is at liberty to redress itself by force of arms, after having given fair warning of hostile intentions, according to the forms established among civilized nations. Unless these forms are observed, there is no faith in the law of nations, no security for commerce, and no difference between the justifiable operations of war, and the most arbitrary acts of piracy and usurpation: for if every power is at liberty to in∣terpret its pretended grievances into aggression, and to retaliate this supposed aggression by immediate acts of hostility, commenced without remonstrance or denunciation; all those individuals, who by com∣merce and communication sustain the intercourse among the nations, forming as it were one great community of human nature, must be perpetually exposed to violence and peculation.

Some regard was likewise due to the following con∣siderations. England, at this period, derived con∣siderable advantages from her trade with Spain. A great number of British merchants and factors were settled in different parts of that kingdom, and concerned in the remittances by the slota from the West-Indies: all these would have been inevitably ruined by a precipitation of hostilities. The ca∣tholic king had a numerous navy; and the active commerce which his subjects had lately carried on, afforded a sufficient number of seamen to equip a very formidable squadron, to act in conjunction with the other enemies of Great Britain.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761. Is grati∣fied with a pension.</NOTE> These, in all probability, were the reasons which induced all the other ministers of the privy council to dissent from the opinion of the secretary of state, who forthwith resigned his employment, on the ninth day of October; and his example was imme∣diately followed by his brother-in law, the earl Temple. Notwithstanding this abrupt secession, the king, with a generosity peculiar to himself, gratified him for his past services with a yearly pension of three thousand pounds, to be continued even after his decease, during the survivancy of his lady and son; and this gratuity was reinforced with the title of baroness of Chatham to his lady, and that of baron to her heirs male, Mr. Pitt for his own person declining the distinction of nobility. This event excited such a loud clamour as had not been heard since the trial of admiral Byng. It divided the nation into violent factions, and deluged the public with inundations of pamphlets, papers, and pasquinades. The friends and admirers of Mr. P—exclaimed, that after he had raised the nation from the lowest state of contempt and despondency, to the highest pinnacle of glory and exultation, he was ungratefully thwarted in his designs for the public good, and thrust from the helm at the most critical juncture, by a cabal of wicked and worth∣less men, whose misconduct had formerly brought the common-wealth to the verge of ruin. They expatiated upon the wonderful talents of the late minister: they enumerated the successes of the Bri ish arms during the period of his administra∣tion: they ascribed them wholly and solely to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sdom of his plans and the vigour of his coun∣sels:
<PB N="328" REF="3380"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> they affirmed, that had his proposal with respect to Spain been embraced, the catholic king would have been obliged to renounce his connec∣tion with the French monarch; or his homeward bound flota, laden with treasure, would have falier into the hands of the English, and indemnified them for the expence of the war; and, in all pro∣bability, the port and city of Cadiz would have been subdued by a bold effort of the British armament; whereas, now that he no longer animated the ma∣chine of government, its councils would degene∣rate into timidity, and the administration of affairs revert into the old channel, leading to diffidence, disgrace, and distraction. Another party were not less vehement in their invectives against the late S—y. They taxed him with inconsistency, want of principle, and the most turbulent ambition. They asserted, that he had no sooner forced himself into the administration by dint of popularity, than he turned tail to those very principles by the pro∣fession of which that popularity was acquited: that he plunged with the most desperate precipi∣tation into those continental measures, against which it had been the business of his life to declaim: that he adopted this new system, so contrary to his former maxims and solemn declarations, without any change of circumstance that should indicate a change of measures; without specifying any cause▪ or adducing one reason for the satisfaction of his country: that he not only espoused those interests which he had so often stigmatized as disgraceful to the crown and pernicious to the kingdom; but es∣poused them with such warmth as no former mini∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

They asserted, that all his military projects were either idle, frivolous, or foreign to the interest of Great-Britain; and that no part of the success that had crowned her arms, either flowed from any plan which he had formed, or was atchieved by officers whom he had recommended: that he had left the conquest of Louisiana, which was really a British measure unattempted, in order to prosecute the war in Westphalia, an aim equally spurious and destructive to the interests of Great Britain; and prosecuted it accordingly at an incredible expence of blood and treasure, without being able to defend either the countries or the allies which he had so injudiciously taken into his protection: that per∣ceiving the nation began to open their eyes to the absurdity and ruinous consequences of such con∣nections; that the king of Prussia was surrounded with enemies, against whom he could not possibly contend much longer; that the French were pos∣sessed of Hesse-Cassel and Hanover; and the forces payed by England in the most imminent danger of being disarmed with disgrace; he had exercised his invention to find some specious pretence for quitting the reins he could no longer manage with any degree of reputation; and for transferring, at the same time, the attention of the public to another object, in which their passions would be more warmly interested: that for this purpose he
<PB N="330" REF="3400"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> had contrived the proposal of a Spanish war, which could not fail to dazzle the eyes of the people, al∣ready intoxicated with conquest; accordingly, after having steered the vessel of the common-wealth into a dangerous straight, replete with rocks and quick∣sands, he had deserted the helm in the midst of the tempest he had raised, leaving his country to sink or swim as accident should determine, and his fel∣low servants in the ministry the Herculean task of remedying the mischiefs he had brewed, or the hardship of being censured for miscarriages resulting from the errors of his administration. In a word, he was accused of having misconducted the war, betrayed the interests, and prosused the treasures of his country; of having insulted his indulgent sovereign, deserted him in the day of trouble, em∣broiled him with his allies abroad, and made him uneasy with his subjects at home. This was, no doubt, the language of party spleen and inveterate malice. Mr. P—t himself seemed to think, not only that his duty dictated the step he had taken, but that his personal safety depended upon his withdrawing himself from councils which he was no longer permitted to guide. He condescended to justify himself, in a letter to a certain individual in the city of London, who in his answer declared, that he and his fellow-citizens were perfectly satis∣fied with the conduct of the late S—y <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>A Letter from a Right Hon.

<P>"Finding, to my great sur∣prise, that the cause and man∣ner of my resigning the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eals, are grosly misrepresented in the city, as well as that the most gracious and <HI>spontaneous</HI> marks of his majesty's appro∣bation of my services, which marks followed my resigna∣tion, have been infamously traduced as a bargain for my forsaking the Public, I am under a necessity of declaring the truth of both these facts, in a manner which I am sure no gentleman will contradict. A difference of opinion with regard to measures to be ta∣ken against Spain, of the highest importance to the ho∣nour of the crown, and to the most essential national inte∣rests, (and this founded on what Spain had already done, not on what that court may farther intend to do) was the cause of my resigning the seals. Lord Temple and I submitted in writing, and signed by us, our most humble sentiments to his majesty, which being over-ruled by the united opi∣nion of all the rest of the king's servants, I resigned the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eals on Monday the 5th of this month, in order not to remain responsible for mea∣sures, which I was no longer allowed to guide.

<P>"The city of London, as long as they have any me∣mory, cannot forget, that you accepted the seals when this nation was in the most deplorable circumstances to which any country can be re∣duced: That our armies were beaten, our navy inactive, our trade exposed to the enemy, our credit, as if we expected to become bankrupts, sunk to the lowest pitch; that there was nothing to be found but despondency at home, and contempt abroad. The city must also for ever remember, that when you resigned the seals, our armies and navies were victorious, our trade se∣cure, and flourishing more than in a peace, our public credit restored, and people readier to lend than ministers to borrow: that there was nothing but exultation at home, confusion and despair among our enemies, amaze∣ment and veneration among all neutral nations: that the French were reduced so low as to sue for a peace, which we, from humanity, were willing to grant; tho' their haughtiness was too great, and our successes too many, for any terms to be agreed on. Remembering this, the city cannot but lament that you have quitted the helm. But if knaves have taught fools to call your resignation (when you can no longer pro∣cure the same success, being prevented from pursuing the same measures) a desertion of the public, and to look upon you, for accepting a reward, which can scarce bear that name, in the light of a pen∣sioner; the city of London hope, they shall not be ranked by you among the one or the other. They are truly sen∣sible, that, though you cease to guide the helm, you have not deserted the vessel; and that, pensioner as you are, your inclination to promote the public good, is still only to be equalled by your ability: that you sincerely wish suc∣cess to the new pilot, and will be ready, not only to warn him and the crew of rocks and quicksands, but to assist in bringing the ship through the strom into a safe harbour.</P>

England, after their coronation, Mr. P—mingled<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 176<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> with the procession, and in passing through the streets was saluted with such peals of acclamation, as seemed to derogate from the respect due to the most amiable sovereign that ever sate upon the British throne. The populace not only rent the air with their shouts, but expressed a desire of un∣yoking his horses, that they might draw, by force of arm, the chariot of their beloved minister. The same demonstrations of particular veneration were industriously repeated in the sequel of the enter∣tainment, and in the return of their majesties to St. James's; nor did the scurril herd of low ple∣beians refrain from exclamations of disgust against an unblemished nobleman, supposed to enjoy a di∣stinguished share of his sovereign's confidence and esteem. The more moderate part of the nation beheld these incidents with concern. They could not conceive that Mr. P—was at all influenced by fears for his personal safety in the step he had taken. They knew he might have dissented in one particular from the majority of the council, without quitting his seat, and run no sort of risque of being afterwards called to account for measures adopted in opposition to his opinion. They took it for granted his mind soared above all such child∣ish apprehensions. They thought the abrupt and ungracious manner in which he resigned his em∣ployment, not only deprived his country of his service and influence at a time that peculiarly de∣manded an exertion of his talents; but his seces∣sion favoured of disgust and resentment, and im∣plying a disapprobation of the k—g's measures,
<PB N="334" REF="3440"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> acted as a ferment upon the ill humour of the people. Such a commotion could not fail to clog the wheels of government, obstruct the public ser∣vice, and might perhaps have some effect in al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣nating the affections of the subjects. They were of opinion that his accepting a pension and title did violence to the delicacy of his character, as a disinterested patriot, which character had been the subject of repeated encomium, and the theme of general admiration. They were sorry he had not denied himself the pleasure of assisting at the pro∣cession to Guildhall, as his conduct on that occa∣sion afforded an handle to his enemies, to charge him with having gone thither on purpose to brow∣beat his S—, to whose generosity he had been so much obliged; to sollicit popularity, and exhibit himself as an idol of the crowd; and to receive the public incense of mobs hired to shout in his praise. That his friends should be driven to such a wretched expedient is scarce credible, considering how high his reputation stood in the metropolis at this pe∣riod. About the latter end of October, it was re∣solved in the common-council, that the thanks of that court should be given to the Right Hon. William Pitt, for the many great and eminent ser∣vices rendered this nation, during the time he so ably filled the high and important office of one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state; and to perpetuate the grateful sense of his merits, who, by the vigour of his mind, had not only roused the ancient spirit of this nation from the pusilla∣nimous state to which it had been reduced; but, by his integrity and steadiness, uniting it at home,

Therefore, the city of London, ever sted∣fast in their loyalty to their king, and attentive to the honour and prosperity of their country, could not but lament the loss of so able, so faithful a minister, at this critical conjuncture.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflec∣tions on the con∣duct of the com∣mon council.</NOTE> Whether this resolution was not in fact an arro∣gation of right to decide upon the merits of a minister, the particulars of whose conduct they could not sufficiently distinguish; and implied a disapprobation of their S—n and his council, be∣cause they had not implicitly surrendered their own faculties of perception and reflection, to the ideas of one man; nay more, because they had not com∣plied with the violent measures he proposed, in di∣ametrical opposition to their own sentiments and judgment; posterity will be candid enough to determine, when those clouds of prejudice which now darken the understanding, are dissipated, and all the rancour of personal animosity is allayed and forgotten. The common-council of London ven∣tured, at the same time, to dictate in another par∣ticular that depended entirely on the royal preroga∣tive. They transmitted to the city's representatives in parliament, peremptory instructions, that they should use their utmost endeavours, not only to ob∣tain the repeal, or an amendment of the late act for the relief of insolvent debtors, in respect of the inconveniencies arising from the compulsive clause; but also oppose all attempts for giving up such places as might tend to lessen their present security, or

Without deigning to interpose in the dis∣putes that concerned the character of a late mi∣nister, he took every measure which he thought conducive to the honour and interest of the na∣tion. He directed the earl of Bristol, his ambassa∣dor at Madrid, to demand an explanation of the secret treaty which had been lately ratified between the two monarchs of France and Spain; and to de∣clare, that a refusal of this satisfaction would be con∣sidered as a denunciation of hostilities: in the mean time he exerted himself in making preparations suitable to that event.</P>

This was doubtless an object of great importance, and might have been easily accomplished in the first at∣tempt under the conduct of general Hopson; but now the enterprize was encumbered by many diffi∣culties. The island was strengthened with new fortifications, a strong body of troops, a numerous regulated militia, experienced officers, and plenty of provision, artillery, and ammunition.</P>
<P>On the third day of November the new parlia∣ment was opened at Westminster; and, as no mi∣nisterial influence had been used in electing the members of which it was composed, it undoubted∣ly deserved the appellation of a free parliament; a phaenomenon which had not appeared in the meridian of Great Britain for the space of above forty years before this period. The king, being seated on the throne, commanded the attendance of the commons; to whom he signified his plea∣sure, by the mouth of the lord high chancellor, that they should return to their house, and chuse a new speaker. Accordingly their unanimous choice fell upon Sir John Cust, baronet, a gentleman of extensive knowledge and distinguished probity, qualified in all respects to supply the room of Mr. Onslow, who so long and so worthily discharged that important office. His majesty, repairing again to the house of peers on the sixth, approved of the speaker, and harangued the parliament in these words.</P>

<P>"It has been my earnest wish that this first pe∣riod of my reign might be marked with another felicity; the restoring of the blessings of peace to my people, and putting an end to the calamities of war, under which so great a part of Europe suffers.

<P>"The sincerity of my disposition to effectuate this good work has been manifested in the progress of it; and I have the consolation to reflect, that the continuance of the war, and the farther effusion of Christian blood, to which it was the desire of my heart to put a stop, cannot with justice be imputed to me.</P>

They testified the most grateful acknow∣ledgment of his majesty's vigilance and firmness, in not suffering the hopes and expectations of peace to produce the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast suspence or relaxation in the exer∣tion of his arms; and congratulated his majesty on those happy successes, which, under the good pro∣vidence of God, they ascribed to the wisdom and vigour of his majesty's measures: to these they owed the reduction of Dominica, the conquest of Belleis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chieved with so much reputation to the British arms, and the destruction of the enemy's power in the East Indies, by the acquisition of Pondicherry, their last remaining settlement of any &amp;;strength in those countries.

They assured him, he might depend upon their intire concurrence and support, in the most effectual pro∣secution of the war, for the interest and advantage of Great Britain; and in maintaining, to the ut∣most of their power, the good faith and honour of his majesty's crown, and the engagements entered into with his allies: and they declared themselves truly sensible, that the constant care and attention of his majesty to pursue the most vigorous mea∣sures, in every part; where any successful impres∣sion could still be made upon the enemy, were the only means to attain that desirable object, an ho∣nourable and lasting peace. They acknowledged, with the deepest gratitude, that most endearing ex∣pression of his majesty's unbounded goodness and affection towards his native country, in the solemn declaration which he had been pleased to make, that, as well in the prosecution of the war as in the conclusion of the peace, no consideration whatever should induce him to depart from the true interests of his kingdoms, and from the honour and dig∣nity of his crown.

<P>Over and above this affectionate address to his ma∣jesty, a message was sent by the commons to congra∣tulate the queen upon her royal nuptials; to express the unseigned joy and satisfaction which the house felt upon seeing the most ardent wishes of a faithful people, anxious not only for the present and future welfare of these kingdoms, but also for the imme∣diate and domestic happiness of their excellent so∣vereign, so compleatly crowned by his majesty's wise and happy choice of the royal partner of his throne; and to assure her majesty of the most du∣tiful and zealous attachment of the commons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transac∣tions in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> As a great clamour had been raised against the compelling clause in the act, passed during the last session, for the relief of insolvent debtors, this was a circumstance which, previous to all other legisla∣tive measures, engaged the attention of the com∣mons. The house was moved that the clause might be repealed; and leave being given to bring in a bill for that purpose, it soon acquired the sanction of the royal authority. That manifold frauds and

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> abuses were committed in consequence of this clause is not to be denied; but whether, under proper re∣strictions, it might not have been rendered a salu∣tary regulation, in favour of industry and com∣merce, will admit of a dispute. Certain it is, great numbers of people, who were ruined in conse∣quence of this privilege claimed by their debtors, thought themselves cruelly treated, in being de∣prived of the same benefit. The house of com∣mons, in order to manifest the warmth of their attachment to their sovereign, proceeded to take into consideration that part of his speech relating to his royal consort. They resolved, that, in case she should survive his majesty, she should enjoy a pro∣vision of one hundred thousand pounds per annum during her life, together with the palace of Somer∣set-house, and the lodge and lands at Richmond old Park: that the king should be enabled to charge that annuity upon all or any part of such of the revenues, as, by an act made in the last ses∣sion for the support of his majesty's houshold, were directed to be, during the king's life, conso∣lidated with the aggregate fund, and should be sub∣sisting after his majesty's demise; and to charge all or any part of the aggregate fund, as a collateral security for making good the said annuity. A bill formed on these resolutions passed both houses with∣out opposition, and received the royal assent on the second day of December; when the speaker pronounced a speech, addressed to his majesty, re∣plete with expressions of loyalty and affection.</P>
<P>Their next care was to examine estimates, and provide for the prosecution of the war. They

In proportioning the supply, they likewise made good the foreign subsidies, as well as the deficiencies in the grants of the last session.

His instructions imported, that these questions should be put with all the delicacy which the nature of such demands could admit, that Spain should have no cause to complain that

she was treated with want of decorum. The de∣mands<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> were made accordingly, with all imaginable demonstrations of respect; but as the answers given appeared evasive and unsatisfactory, he became more peremptory in his remonstrances; and at length plainly declared, that if the court of Spain should refuse a positive explanation, whether the Catholic king intended to ally himself with France against England, he should interpret the refusal into an aggression and declaration of war, and, in consequence, be obliged to retire from the court of Madrid. The Spanish monarch had already taken his measures in concert with the court of Versailles, and waited only for an opportunity to provoke Great Britain into an immediate rupture. In an∣swer therefore to this declaration, Mr. Wall, the Spanish minister, replied, that such a step could only be suggested by the spirit of haughtiness and of discord, which, for the misfortune of mankind, still reigned but too much in the British govern∣ment; chat it was in that very moment the war was declared, and the king's dignity violently at∣tacked; and the earl might retire how and when he should think proper. Nothing could be more idle and frivolous than this pretence for taking umbrage. Had the English minister failed in point of punctilio, and made an abrupt demand, unauthorized by the law of nations, the court of Madrid might have resented his personal beha∣viour, and complained of it by their ambassador at London; but even in that case, the affront would have been, by all the reasonable part of mankind, deemed too inconsiderate a cause for involving the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> two nations in the horrors and misery of war: yet even this plea was wanting. The earl of Bristol proceeded with delicacy and caution, and did not insist upon a categorical answer until every milder method had been tried without success. The most extraordinary circumstance attending this rupture was the purport of a paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Trarslation of a Note delivered to the Earl of Egremont by the Count de Fuentes, Ambassador at the Court of London from the Court of Spain, December <HI>25, 1761.</HI></P>
<P>"The count de Fuentes, the Catholic king's ambassa∣dor to his Britannic majesty, has just received a courier from his court, by whom he is informed, that my lord Bristol, his Britannic majes∣ty's ambassador at the court of Madrid, has said to his excellency Mr. Wall, minister of state, that he had orders to demand a positive and ca∣tegorical answer to this ques∣tion, viz. "If Spain thinks of allying herself with France against England;" and to de∣clare, at the same time, that he should take a refusal to his demand for an aggression and declaration of war; and that he should, in conse∣quence, be obliged to retire from the court of Spain. The above minister of state an∣swered him, that such a step could only be suggested by the spirit of haughtiness and discord, which, for the mis∣fortune of mankind, still reigns but too much in the British government: that it was in that very moment that the war was declared, and the king's dignity violently at∣tacked, and that he might retire how and when he should think perfect.</P>
<P>"The count de Fuentes is, in consequence, ordered to leave the court and the do∣minions of England; and to declare to the British king, to the English nation, and to the whole universe, that the horrors into which the Spa∣nish and English nations are going to plunge themselves, must be attributed only to the pride, and to the un∣measurable ambition of him who has held the reins of the government, and who ap∣pears still to hold them, al∣though by another hand: that if his Catholic majesty excused himself from answer∣ing on the treaty in question between his Catholic majesty and his most Christian majes∣ty, which is believed to have been signed the fifteenth of August, and wherein it is pretended, there are condi∣tions relative to England, he had very good reasons: first, the king's dignity required him to manifest his just re∣sentment of the little ma∣nagement, or, to speak more properly, of the insulting manner with which all the affairs of Spain have been treated during Mr. Pitt▪s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who▪ finding himself convinced of the jus∣tice, which supported the king in his pretensions, his ordinary and last answer was, That he would not relax in any thing till the Tower of London was taken sword in hand.</P>
<P>Besides, his majesty was much shocked to hear the haughty and imperious tone, with which the contents of the tr aty were demanded of him: if the respect due to royal majesty had been re∣garded, explanations might have been had without any difficulty: the ministers of Spain might have said frank∣ly to those of England, what the count de Fuentes, by the king's express order▪ declares publicly, viz. That the said treaty is only a convention between the family of Bour∣bon, wherein there is nothing which has the least relation to the present war: that there is in it an article for the mu∣tual guaranty of the domi∣nions of the two sovereigns: but it is specified therein, that that guaranty is not to be understood but of the do∣minions which shall remain to France, after the present war shall be ended; that al∣though his Catholic majesty might have had reason to think himself offended by the irregular manner in which the memorial was returned to M. de Bussy, minister of France, which he had pre∣sented for terminating the differences of Spain and Eng∣land, at the same time with the war between this last and France; he has, however, dissembled, and from an ef∣fect of his love of peace, caused a memorial to be de∣livered to my lord Bristol, wherein it is evidently de∣monstrated, that the step of France, which put the mi∣nister Pitt into so bad hu∣mour, did not at all offend either the laws of neutrality, or the sincerity of the two sovereigns: that further, from a fresh proof of his pacific spirit, the king of Spain wrote to the king of France, his cousin, that if the union of interest in any manner re∣tarded the peace with Eng∣land, he consented to sepa∣rate himself from it, not to put any obstacle to so great a happiness: but it was soon seen that this was only a pre∣tence on the part of the Eng∣lish minister; for that of France continuing his nego∣tiation without making any mention of Spain, and pro∣posing conditions very advan∣tageous and honourable for England, the minister Pitt, to the great astonishment of the universe, rejected them with disdain, and shewed at the same time his ill-will against Spain, to the scandal of the same British council; and unfortunately he has sec∣ceeded but too far in his per∣nicious design.</P>
<P>This declaration made, the count de Fuentes desires his excellency my lord Egremont to present his most humble respects to his Britannic ma∣jesty, and to obtain for him passports, and all other faci∣lities, for him, his family, and all his retinue, to go out of the dominions of Great Britain without any trouble, and to go by the short pas∣sage of the sea, which sepa∣rates them from the conti∣nent."</P>
<P>Translation of the Answer del vered to the count de Fuentes by the Earl of Egremont, Dec. <HI>31, 1761.</HI></P>
<P>"The earl of Egrement, his Britannic majesty's secre∣tary of state, having received from his excellency the count de Fuentes, ambassador of the Catholic king at the court of London a paper, in which, besides the notification of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the demand of the necessary passports to go out of the king's dominions, he has thought proper to enter into what has just passed be∣tween the two courts, with a view to make that of London appear as the source of all the misfortunes which may ensue from the rupture which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happened; in order that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>body may be misled by the declaration, which his excel∣lency has been pleased to make to the king, to the English nation, and to the whole universe; notwith∣standing the insinuation, as void of foundation as of de∣cency, of the spirit of haugh∣tiness and of discord, which, his excellency pretends, reigns in the British government, to the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fortune of mankind; and notwithstanding the irre¦gularity and indecency of ap∣pealing to the English na∣tion, as if it could be sepa∣rated from its king, for whom the most determined senti∣ments of love, of duty, and of confidence, are engraved in the hearts of all his sub∣jects; the said earl of Egre∣mont, by his majesty's ortier, laying aside, in this answer▪ all spirit of declamation and of harshness, avoiding every offensive word, which might hurt the dignity of sovereigns, without stooping to invec∣tives against private persons, will confine himself to facts with the most scrupulous ex∣actness: and it is from this representation of facts, that he appeals to all Europe, and to the whole universe, for the purity of the king's inten∣tions, and for the sincerity of the wishes his majesty has not ceased to make, as well as for the moderation he has always shewed, though in vain, for the maintenance of friendship and good understanding be∣tween the British and Spanish nations.</P>
<P>The king having received undoubted informations, that the court of Madrid had se∣cretly contracted engage∣ments with that of Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>es, which the ministers of France laboured to represent, in all the courts of Europe, as of∣fensive to Great Britain; and combining these appearances with the step, which the court of Spain had, a little time be∣fore, taken towards his ma∣jesty, in avowing its consent (though that avowal had been followed by apologies) to the memorial presented the 23d of July, by the sieur de Bussy, minister plenipotentiary of the most Christian king, to the king's secretary of state; and his majesty having after∣wards received intelligence, scarce admitting a doubt, of troops marching, and of mi∣litary preparations making in all the ports of Spain, judged that his dignity as well as his prudence, required him to order his ambassador at the court of Madrid, by a dispatch, dated the 28th of October, to demand, in terms the most measured however, and the most amicable, a communication of the treaty recently concluded between the courts of Madrid and Versailles, or at least of the articles which might relate to the interests of Great Bri∣tain; and, in order to avoid every thing, which could be thought to imply the least slight of the dignity, or even the delicacy, of his Catholic majesty, the earl of Bris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol was authorised to content himself with assurances, in case the Catholic king offered to give any, that the said engagements did not contain any thing that was contrary to the friendship which sub∣sisted between the two crowns, or that was prejudicial to the interests of Great Britain, supposing that any difficulty was made of shewing the treaty. The king could not give a less equivocal proof of his dependance on the good faith of the Catholic king, than in shewing him an un∣bounded confidence in so im∣portant an affair, and which so essentially interested his own dignity, the good of his kingdoms, and the happiness of his people.</P>
<P>How great, then, was the king's surprize, when, instead of receiving the just satisfac∣tion, which he had a right to expect, he learnt from his ambassador, that, having ad∣dressed himself to the minis∣ter of Spain for that purpose, he could only draw from his a refusal to give a satisfactory answer to his majesty's jus requisitions, which he has accompanied with terms that breathed nothing but haugh∣tiness, animosity, and me∣nace; and which seemed so strongly to verify the suspi∣cions of the unamicable dis∣position of the court of Spain, that nothing less than his majesty's moderation, and his resolution taken to make all the efforts possible to avoid the misfortunes inseparable from a rupture, could deter∣mine him to make a last trial, by giving orders to his am∣bassador to address himself to the minister of Spain, to de∣sire him to inform him of the intentions of the court of Madrid towards that of Great Britain in this conjuncture, if they had taken engage∣ments, or formed the design to join the king's enemies in the present war, or to depart, in any manner, from the neu∣tality they had hitherto ob∣served; and to make that minister sensible, that, if they persisted in refusing all satis∣faction on demands so just, so necessary, and so interest∣ing, the king could not but consider such a refusal as the most au<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hentick avowal, that Spain had taken her part, and that there only remained for his majesty to take the measures which his royal pru∣dence should dictate for the honour and dignity of his crown, and for the prospe∣rity and protection of his people; and to recal his am∣bassador.</P>
<P>Unhappily for the public tranquillity, for the interest of the two nations, and for the good of mankind, this last step was as fruitless as the preceding ones; the Spa∣nish minister, keeping no fur∣ther measures, answered dri∣ly, "That it was in that very moment that the war was declared, and the king's dig∣nity attacked, and that the earl of Bristol might retire how, and when, he should think proper."</P>
<P>And in order to set in its true light the declaration, "That, if the respect due to his Catholick majesty had been regarded, explanations might have been had without any difficulty; and that the ministers of Spain might have said frankly, as Mons. de Fuentes, by the king's express order, declares publicly, that the said treaty is only a con∣vention between the family of Bourbon; wherein there is nothing which has the least relation to the present war; and that the guaranty, which is therein specified, is not to be understood but of the do∣minions which shall remain to France after the war:" it is declared, that, very far from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> being want∣ing to the respect▪ acknow∣ledged to be due to crowned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tructions given to the earl of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to make the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Ver¦sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, with all the decency, and all the attention possible; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was not made till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to give the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> therefore, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ever had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this so ne∣cessary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> they had not the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reason, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have engaged them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> it to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be of use. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the terms▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which the declara∣tion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are us the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not having received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for it appears at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sight, that the answer is not at all conformable to the demand: we wanted to be informed, <HI>if the court of Spain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to join the French, our enemies, to make war on Great Britain, or to a▪part from their neutrality:</HI> whereas the answer concerns one treaty only, which is said to be of the 15th of August, carefully avoiding to say the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word that c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uid explain, in any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Spain towards Great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or the further engagements they may have contracted in the present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General descrip∣tion of Marti∣nique.</NOTE> As we have mentioned the second expedition against Martinique, we shall conclude our narra∣tion with an account of the success which attended this enterprize. It may be necessary to inform the reader, that Martinique is the largest of all the Ca∣ribbee Islands, situated between the fourteenth and fifteenth degrees of north latitude, about the mid∣dle between Barbadoes and Guadaloupe, to wind∣ward of Antigua and St. Christopher's. It extends twenty leagues in length, and may be about one hundred and thirty miles in circumference; in∣dented by a great number of creeks and harbours; diversified with hill and dale, shaded with woods, watered by many streams; in climate sultry, in soil fertile, producing a very considerable quantity of sugar, indigo, coffee, cotton, ginger, aloes, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mento Here the governor general of all the French Islands in this part of the world resides; and here is establis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the sovereign council, whose jurisdiction extends over a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the French Antilles, and even to the settlements of that crown in the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> islands of St. Domingo and Tortuga. In a word Martinique is the most populous and flourishing of all the colonies which the French nation possess in America. Its towns and harbours are strongly fortified: the country itself is rendered extreme∣ly difficult of access by woods, passe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, rivers, rocks, and ravines; defend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a body of regul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r troops, and reinforced by a disciplined militia, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to consist of ten thousand white natives, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our times that number of negroes, whom they can arm in cases of emergency. The reduction of this island was an object of the greatest consequence to Great Britain, not only on account of its own in∣trinsic worth, and the det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iment which the less of it must occasion to the enemy, but likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the security of the English islands, amongst which it is situated, and of the British trading ships, which were terr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly annoyed by the privateers of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ti∣nique.</P>

The general, however, judg∣ing this an improper place for a disembarkation, two brigades, commanded by the brigadiers Havi∣land and Grant, were detached under convoy to the bay of Petite-Anse, where a battery was cannonaded and taken by the seamen and marines. These bri∣gades were soon followed by the whole army, and the rest of the squadron; and other batteries being silenced, general Monckton and the forces landed without further opposition on the sixteenth, in the neighbourhood of the Cas des Navires. The bri∣gadiers Haviland and Grant had made a descent in the other place, and marched to the ground oppo∣site to Pigeon-Island, which commands the har∣bour of Fort-Royal: but the road being found impassable for artillery, Mr. Monckton altered his first design. The two brigades, however, with the light infantry under lieutenant-colonel Scot, while they remained on shore, were attacked in the night by a body of grenadiers, freeboo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, negroes, and mulattoes, who had been sent over from Fort-Royal; but they met with such a warm reception as compelled them to retreat with precipitation▪ after having sustained some loss.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrender of Fort-Royal.</NOTE> The troops being landed at Cas des Navires, and reinforced with two battalions of marines, which were spared from the squadron, the general resolved to besiege the town of Fort-Royal; but, in order to make his approaches, he found it neces∣sary to attack the heights of Garnier and Tortue∣son, which the enemy had fortified, and seemed re∣solved
<PB N="366" REF="3760"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to defend to the last extremity. The Eng∣lish commander, having erected a battery to favour the passage of a ravine which separated him from those heights, made a disposition for the attack, which was put in execution on the twenty-fourth day of January. In the dawn of the morning, brigadier Grant, at the head of the grenadiers, sup∣ported by lord Rollo's brigade, attacked the ad∣vanced posts of the enemy, under a br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the batteries; while brigadier R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fane with his bri∣gade, reinforced by the marines, marched up on the right to attack the redoubts that were raised along the shore; and the light infantry under colonel Scot, supported by the brigade of Walsh, advanced on the left of a plantation, in order, if possible, to turn the enemy. They succeeded in their attempt, while the grenadiers were engaged in driving the French from one post to another; and this motion contributed in a great measure to the success of the day. By nine in the morning they were in posses∣sion of the Morne To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tueson, and all the redoubts and batteries with which it was fortified. The ene∣my retired in con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion to the town of Fort-Royal, and to the Morne Garnier, which, being more high and inaccessible than the other, was deemed im∣practicable. During the contest for the possession of Tortueson, brigadier Haviland, at the head of his brigade, with two battalions of highlanders, and another corps of light infantry under major Leland, was ordered to pass the ravine a good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to the left, and turn a body of the enemy posted on the opposite heights, in hope of being able to divide their forces; but the country was so difficult
<PB N="367" REF="3770"/>
of access, that it was late before this passage was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> effected. In the mean time, the general, per∣ceiving the enemy giving way on all sides, ordered colonel Scot's light insantry, with Walsh's brigade, and a division of the grenadiers, to advance on the left to a plantation, from whence they drove the enemy, and where they took possession of an ad∣vantageous post opposite to the Morne Garnier. They were supported on the right by Haviland's corps, when they passed the ravine; and the road between the two plantations, which they occupied, was covered by the marines. Next day the Eng∣lish began to erect batteries against the citadel of Fort-Royal; but were greatly annoyed from Morne Garnier. On the twenty-seventh, about four in the afternoon, the enemy made a furious atttack, with the greatest part of their forces, on the posts occupied by the light infantry and brigadier Havi∣land; but were handled so roughly, that they soon retired in disorder. Such was the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dour of the English troops, that they passed the ravine with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugitives, seized their batteries, and took possession of the ground, being supported by the brigade of Walsh and the grenadiers under Grant, who march∣ed up to their assistance when the attack began. Major Leland, with his light infantry, finding no resistance on the left, advanced to the redoubt which was abandoned; and the brigadiers Walsh, Grant, and Haviland, moved up in order to sup∣port him; so that by nine at night the British troops were in possession of this very strong post, that commanded the citadel, against which their own artillery was turned in the morning. The
<PB N="368" REF="3780"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> French regular troops had fled into the town, and the militia dispersed in the country. The gover∣nor of the citadel, perceiving the English em∣ployed in erecting batteries on the different heights by which he was commanded, ordered the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>made to be beat, and surrendered the place by capitula∣tion. On the fourth of February the gate of the citadel was delivered up to the English; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>xt morning the garrison, to the number of eight hun∣dred, marched out with the honours of war. Im∣mediately after the reduction of Fort-Royal, depu∣tations were sent from different quarters of the island, desiring a capitulation: but the governor-general, Mr. de la Touche, retired with his forces to St. Pierre, which he proposed to defend with un∣common vigour. On the seventh, Pidgeon-Island, which was strongly fortified, and counted one of the best defences of the harbour, surrendered at the first summons, and obtained a capitulation similar to that of the citadel. It was agreed, that the troops of the French king should be transported to Rochfort in France; that the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itia should lay down their arms, and remain prisoners of war, untii the fate of the island should be determined. These signal successes were obtained at the small expence of about four hundred men, including a few offi∣cers, killed and wounded in the different attacks; but the loss of the enemy was much more consi∣derable. The most remarkable circumstance of this enterprize was the surprising boldness and ala∣crity of the seamen, who, by force of arm, drew a number of heavy mortars and ships cannon up the steepest mountains to a considerable distance
<PB N="369" REF="3790"/>
from the sea, and across the enemy's line of fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to which they exposed themselves with amazing indifference. Fourteen French privateers were found in the harbour of Port-Royal; and a much greater number, from other ports in the island, were delivered up to admiral Rodney, in conse∣quence of the capitulation with the inhabitants, who, in all other respects, were very favourably treated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reducti∣on of the whole island.</NOTE> Just when general Monckton was ready to em∣bark for the reduction of St. Pierre, a very large and flourishing town, situated to leeward of Fort-Royal, two deputies arrived with proposals of ca∣pitulation for the whole island on the part of Mr. de la Touche, the governor general. On the fourteenth the terms were settled, and the capitu∣lation signed: on the sixteenth the English com∣mander took possession of St. Pierre, and all the posts in that neighbourhood; while the governor-general, with Mr. Rouille, the lieutenant-governor, the staff officers, and about three hundred and twenty grenadiers, were embarked in transports, to be conveyed to France. That such an important conquest should be atchieved almost without blood∣shed, was in a great measure owing to the favour∣able capitulation which the island of Guadaloupe had obtained, and the good faith with which the articles of that capitulation had been observed by the conquerors. Indeed, the inhabitants of Marti∣nique, who were indulged with nearly the same terms, must have found themselves considerably gainers by their change of sovereign; inasmuch as, together with the enjoyment of their own reli∣gion,
<PB N="370" REF="3800"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> laws, and property, they had now an oppor∣tunity of exporting their produce to advantage, and of being supplied with all necessaries from the do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inions of Great Britain; whereas, before they fell under the English government, their commerce was almost intirely interrupted, and they were obliged to depend even for subsistence upon the most precarious and hazardous methods of supply. By the reduction of Martinique, the island of Antigua, St Christopher's, and Nevis, together with the ships trading to these colonies, are perfectly secured against the depredations of the enemy; and Great Britain acquires an annual addi∣tion in commerce, at least, to the amount o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one mil∣lion sterling. While general Monckton was em∣ployed in regulating the capitulation of this island, commodore Swanton sailed with a small squadron to the isle of Grenade, which, with some others possessed by the French, depends upon Martinique, and in all probability would submit without oppo∣sition.</P>

<P>At the end of the third volume of our Conti∣nuation, we, in order to evince our own impar∣tiality, and for no other consideration, inserted some remarks which commodore Moore had made on our account of the expedition to Martinique, and the conquest of Guadalupe.</P>
<P>Major-general Barrington, conceiving himself aggrieved by some of those remarks, has claimed the same privilege of making observations in his turn; and we, for the same reason, have complied with his demand.</P>
<P>For our own parts, we espouse neither side of the question.

<P>It is not denied that the returns of the army, when we arrived at Barbadoes, amounted to five thousand eight hundred men: but it will appear also, by the re∣turns, that no more were landed at Martinique than four thousand four hundred and sixty-eight men.</P>

<P>The general having desired that the cannon might be landed at a savannah, where the boats must have been greatly exposed to the fire of the enemy, which would have rendered the service imprac∣ticable, according to the opi∣nions of the pilots and cap∣tains, given in a council of war held for that purpose, Mr. Moore communicated these opinions to the general; but at the same time offered to land the cannon on the other side of Point Negro, at a place equally near the road from the English army to Fort-Royal, and even cause them to be drawn up by the sea∣men, without giving any trouble to the troops. The general, instead of embracing this proposal, sent a second message to the commodore,</P>
<DIV3>
<P>Mr. Hopson was so sen∣sible of his want of sufficient strength, that he applied to the commodore to have the marines put under his com∣mand, that they might be landed with the army: this Mr. Moore excused himself from granting, not knowing what enemy there might be in those seas, and, of conse∣quence, supposing that he might have occasion for them himself.</P>
<P>Art. 2. In regard to the commodore's offer of draw∣ing the artillery, &amp;c. Major-general B—n can by no means speak to it, as he had, at the time that offer was sent, gone on board the Cam∣bridge with a message from general Hopson: neither did he ever know that such an offer was made, till the day after the army reimbarked.</P>
<P>The message that he car∣ried was, That if the com∣modore would land the artil∣lery, stores, &amp;c. at the savan∣nah, the army would march next morning, and attack the fort in conjunction with the fleet.</P>
<P>This offer, which the ge∣neral gave in writing, could not be complied with, for the reason alledged by the commodore; no more than</P>

<P>an offer he took upon him∣self to make, that he would accept of any place to east-ward of the Bluff-point: nei∣ther did he ever hear that there was any other place pro∣posed, except Point Negro. This is not meant as the smallest impeachment, in re∣gard to the conduct of the fleet, which did every thing possible upon that occasion: but, in order to justify the army for having r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imbarked it will be necessary to say, that by the detours it must have made, in order to avoid the Morne Tortueson, the dis∣tance was upwards of four miles to the fort, without any practicable road for drawing the artillery, but what must have been made by them∣selves, and that over a coun∣try which no European can have the least idea of. It would, besides, have been absolutely necessary to have established a chain of very strong posts, in order to have kept up its communication with the fleet, even if the commodore could have made good his offer of drawing the artillery, which seems more than doubtful, as it would have taken up two thousand five hundred seamen; yet how were provisions to be con∣veyed for an army that con∣sisted (including women, ser∣vants,</P>

<P>The commodore, being well acquainted with the place, made a disposition for the attack, from which he could not be diverted by the opinion of the chief engineer, and other officers, who, after having reconnoitred the for∣tifications, declared they thought them impregnable to shipping—as appears from Mr. Moore's letter to the se∣cretary of state.</P>

<P>Art. 3. It is by no means denied that the resolution of attacking the fort by sea was a very spirited one; or that it was not conducted with such bravery, as will always do honour to those gentle∣men who had the honour to command those ships that lay before it: but the conse∣quence by no means invali∣dated the opinion of the chief engineer, or the other offi∣cers, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is certain that the fort was not, nor indeed could it, from its elevation, be much hurt by the shipping; neither did the enemy abandon it till they saw, by our manoeuvre, that we were preparing to land.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"It was soon after the troops were ordered for re-imbarking from off the island of Martinico, that I was made acquainted with the motives which induced the general for taking such a step: I then understood the message from the general to commodore Moore was, that if he, the commodore, could make an attack with his fleet, or land the artillery, stores, and pro∣visions, &amp;c. nearer Fort Royal, the army, at all events, should march the next morning to invest the place; if not, boats to be sent on shore in the evening, for the troops to be taken on board. His answer was, that they could not be landed nearer, or at any other place, than where the troops landed; and he would un∣dertake, with his sailors, to land them there. But at a meeting of the general offi∣cers, the next morning, on board of his ship▪ he then said that his message was, that he not only offered to land them at the place before mentioned, but likewise to transport them wherever the service might require. This much surprised general Hop∣son▪ and all the other general officers, who never took his answer in that sense. Being asked, what number of men he could spare from the fleet for that service, he mentioned four, or at most six hundred men, which was known to be greatly insufficient.</P>
<P>As for the chief engineer, giving his opinion against his majesty's ships of war attack∣ing Fort Royal on the island of Guadaloupe, I am certain he continued in the same sen∣timents after the attack was made, and the place aban∣doned; and I should not do justice to his character, were I of any other: for as the fort was on an eminence, it rendered their fire but of a very immaterial service towards reducing it, there being not a gun dismounted, nor much damage done to any capital work; nor did the enemy quit the fort, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cease firing, till the morning after the attack was made. They were sensible of no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being able to hold out forty eight hours after the troops made good their landing. As it was commanded by heights, I think it would not have taken more time to have re∣duced it; and of consequence they must have weakened their own strength, by leav∣ing a sufficient number of men for garrisoning the place, to be taken prisoners.</P>

<P>After having observed that they laid him under great difficulty, by requesting that so late in the evening, which might have been granted so easily when it was first pro∣posed,</P>

<P>Art. 4. The reason why the troops, that were assem¦bled under the stern of the Woolwich, did not land, a was proposed, under colon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clavering, was, that the great¦est</P>

<PB N="377" REF="3870"/>
<P>he took his measures with such expedition and suc∣cess, that in less than an hour the troops were rendez∣voused under the Woolwich's stern, when the landing was again postponed; though the evening was favourable, the Woolwich at that time very near the shore, and the Spy sloop within her, almost close to the beach. In consequence of this delay, it was found extremely difficult to dispose of the men for that night, as it would have been impossible for them to find their respec∣tive transports in the dark: but this difficulty was sur∣mounted by the commodore, who distributed them among the ships of war. Several vessels, set on fire by the ene∣my, being seen driving about, Mr. Moore, with the trans∣ports, kept to windward all night, in such a situation as</P>
<DIV3>
<P>part of the transports were drove to the leeward; which when general Hopson was make acquainted with, and that, in case of necessity, the colonel could not be pro∣perly supported, he counter∣manded them.</P>
<P>As to the offer of landing the troops at twelve o'clock, it could not, with propriety, have been accepted of, as at that time the coast had never been reconnoitred; neither was it done till major-general B—n obtained leave from the general to do it next morning, when he pitched upon the place where the troops actually landed.</P>

<P>The enemy threw up no intrenchments in the way to the Dos d'Ane:—the pass was hilly, but very accessible by means of a tolerable road, tho' stony and rugged. When the governor of Guadaloupe rejected the proposal sent with the flag of truce, the general would have tried the effect of a second message, which Mr. Moore warmly opposed, re∣commending it to him to se∣cond his blow while the ene∣my were in cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nation, and offering to assist him with the mariner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who were under his command.

Whoever has seen the Dos d'Ane, and is any sort of judge of ground, must know that there was no ne∣cessity, or even use, for forti∣fying what nature had done every thing for: however, the enemy did not neglect even that. The whole of the road from the sea to the Dos d'Ane, which is near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miles, is so narrow, that, in many places, not above three men could march in fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and most part of it very rocky and steep.</P>
<P>All the parts that flanked the road had been fortified, and artillery planted in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, such as Bisdary, Vaubelle, La Barterie Mutine, the Jesuits, the Hospital, and the house of Mr. La Garde, at which the enemy had established their head-quarters. Above all this, was the grand camp, from which their cannon com∣manded the road. From thence there was another, which led to the Dos d'Ane, not above six feet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, a perpendicular precipice on</P>

<P>When the marines had taken possession of Fort Louis, Mr. Moore, at the desire of general Hopson, went on board the Panther, accom∣panied by colonel Clavering, to reconnoitre the coast, and fixed upon a landing-place near Arnonville, where the troops were actually disem∣barked.</P>

This was flanked by hills, that could not be at∣tacked from the plain below, and enfiladed from the front of the Dos d'Ane, which is not above five hundred yards in breadth, and both flanks were covered by inaccessible rocks and woods. Had even all these difficulties been sur∣mounted, there were still more to encounter, if possible, of a stronger nature; I mean the redoubt, without which, our being masters of the Dos d'Ane would not have been of the least service, and which we must have abandoned, as it would have been next to impossible to have supplied that post with provisions.</P>
<P>Art. 6. When the com∣modore reconnoitred the coast of the Capesterre, it was some time before general Hopson's death; and at that time ge∣neral Barrington had pro∣posed to him to take sixteen hundred men, and carry the war on that side of the island. This would have put the enemy between two fires, and there is the greatest probabi∣lity to believe it would have been attended with success; but this the general would never consent to, tho' often pressed to it by general Bar∣rington. The army at that time amounted to three thou∣sand</P>

<PB N="380" REF="3900"/>
<P>The town was intirely de∣molished, except some few houses at the end next Fort Royal; and those that came down were only attracted by curiosity to see the ruins—the enemy had but two can∣non, and these were spiked up by those that made a sally from the citadel—when the magazine blew up, Mr. Moore sent ships immediately to the assistance of the fort, which however had sustained very little damage.</P>
<P>The commodore never dreamed they would attempt landing in this place, know∣ing that the enemy had driven stakes under water for the destruction of the boats. The inconveniencies of land∣ing here he had represented</P>
<DIV3>
<P>three hundred men, fit for service; but when the landing was made good, it consisted, after weakening greatly the garrison of Fort Louis, of between twelve and thirteen hundred only. It was near three weeks before this period that Mr. Moore advised the going to Houel∣bourg, which the general thought so impracticable, that he would not consent to it: it fell of course afterwards, when we were masters of the posts of Arnonville and Petit∣bourg.</P>
<P>Art. 7. The enemy had three pieces of eighteen poun∣ders, besides a mortar of thir∣teen inches, which last they received from Martinique. During the siege, the battery was attacked at twelve o'clock at noon, and carried by cap∣tain Bloomer of the sixty-first regiment.</P>

<P>to the general, before he sail∣ed to Dominique.</P>
<P>The commodore employed his cruisers with such effect, that no provisions were land∣ed at Mahaut since the first attack of the island. A trader of St. Eustatia offered to sup∣ply the commodore with ten thousand barrels of beef, at an under-price, declaring, without scruple, that the Bri∣tish cruisers had effectually prevented him from disposing of it at any French market. Besides, the inhabitants of Guadalupe would have been chargeable with the greatest absurdity, had they collected magazines of provision in the defenceless town of Mahaut, situated at such a distance from the centre of their posts, while the enemies had it in their power to cut off the communication: but, if they had, it would have reflected no blame upon the commo∣dore, who had done every thing in the power of ships to prevent it.</P>
<DIV3>
<P>apprised of, that he never at∣tempted to land there, which otherwise would have been a most advantageous spot.</P>
<P>Art. 9. The severest stroke the inhabitants felt, during the whole operations, was the destroying of the magazine of Bay-Mahaut. This ren∣dered all their future defence useless, as by that means the redoubt, where were all the old people, women, and chil∣dren, was cut off from being supplied.</P>
<P>Mr. Moore is very much mistaken, when he says that it was an improper place for a magazine: it was, as near as could be, in the center of the two islands, and as far removed as possible, con∣sistent with safety and conve∣nience, from the enemy. It was on that side of the island which was most convenient to receive provisions from St. Eustatia; and, besides, there was so little water there, that the large ships could not come near it. Had they esta∣blished their magazine on the sea-coast on the other side, which is the Capesterre, it would always have been sub∣ject to have been destroyed by the landing of a few men. Where they had placed it, that was impracticable, as across the island it is above nine miles, which we must have marched to have destroy∣ed</P>

This would have been madness, before we were in possession of these places, tho' after∣wards a very easy task. It will appear, from a letter wrote by Mr. Des Hayes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Translation of the Letter from Messieurs Vidal and Des Hayes to Major-General Barrington.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"In answer to the letter you have done us the honour to write, relating to several circumstances concerning the siege of Guadaloupe, of which you require the true state, as we were eye-witnesses of what passed; Mr. Vidal having acted, during the siege, as a captain of the horse-militia, and at the beginning of the siege as aid-du-camp to the governor; and Mr. Des Hayes as captain in the infantry-mi∣litia.</P>
<P>We declare, Sir, that, with respect to the first article of your letter, what you alledge is very true, in regard to the difficulty of the road by the sea-side, leading to the gene∣ral quarters, as well as that of the Dos d'Ane: this last is so steep and narrow, al∣most through its whole ex∣tent, which is about four thousand paces, or four Eng∣lish miles, that three men can scarce march a-breast; and in many places it is so incumbered with stones as to be absolutely impracticable. Moreover, it was the more difficult to be forced, as en∣trenchments had been made, and posts fortified the whole length of the road; as at Bisdary, Vaubelle, la Batterie Mutine, the Jesuits, the Hos∣pital, and, lastly, the guard at the general quarters; and above all this, the grand camp mounted with cannon, which commanded the road.</P>
<P>The inhabitants eagerly wished to be attacked in this place, hoping to see your troops sink under the at∣tempt. Their hopes were founded on the nature of the road, which would have pro∣duced new difficulties. They knew it was out of the reach of the cannon of the ships; and they were not afraid of being attacked in other places, being covered by the river of Gallion, being secured on both sides by such a prodi∣gious height, and defended by several posts, which it would have been impossible to pass.</P>
<P>As to the second article, concerning the provisions brought to us from St. Eu∣statia to the Bay Mahaut, a little town situated in the bottom of the great Cul de Sac, it is the only place from whence we received any dur∣ing the siege, if we except some boats that came loaden to Port Louis, Petit Canal, and Moule, three towns in Grande-terre, into which some prizes were brought. We had our magazines at the Bay Mahaut, and until that town was reduced, our communi∣cation of provisions was not interrupted. They were at first conveyed to different plantations, particularly to that of Mr. Machicourt at Arnonville, and from thence to the reduit and general quarters: but your descent at Houelbourg, which was fol∣lowed by the reduction of all the posts from the Bay Ma∣haut to Capesterre, and the seizure of all our provisions found in that town, and other places which were burned, from which places we could not possibly transport them in time to our reduits and general quarters; reduced the inhabitants to the absolute necessity of capitulating; be∣ing in want of provisions at the general quarters as well as in other posts, particularly at the reduit, to which all the women, children, and sick had retired; and, in fine, without any hope of receiving a supply, having no longer any communication with the town of the Bay Mahaut, which was moreover the only pass for our militia from Gua∣daloupe to Grand-terre that remained, after the reduction of Fort Louis; which pass had never been interrupted by any cruisers, until you de∣prived us of it.</P>
<P>In regard to the third ar∣ticle of your letter, we can assure you, Sir, that when the marquis of Beauharnois, general of Martinique, arrived at Grande-terre, in the squa∣dron of Mr. de Bompart, a few days after the capitula∣tion of Guadaloupe, he dis∣embarked about six hundred regulars, and a considerable number of men draughted from the companies in Mar∣tinique, together with the volunteers, of whom, as we are assured, there were fifteen hundred aboard the ships that composed the squadron, where was likewise store of ammu∣nition suitable to the service; but understanding that Gua∣daloupe had capitulated, they reimbarked. Those were very ill informed who said there were six hundred armed ne∣groes: there were none bu servants who attended their masters, and those not at al intended for fighting. We shall not say any thing posi∣tive about the return of the squadron. If we refer to the general opinion, and to per∣sons particularly acquainted with the situation of the islands, and with the seas by which they are surrounded, it cannot be denied but that if Guadaloupe had not been obliged to capitulate, by your last operations, in cutting off our provisions as well by sea as by land, that squadron might have burned all the transports, before the British squadron off Dominique could have come up, as the French was more than ten leagues to windward, and you had then but one frigate of forty gun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with your transports; and that manoeuvre of our squa∣dron would have infallibly obliged you to raise the siege had it not been for the pre¦caution you had previously taken.</P>
<P>With respect to the fourtl article concerning the Fli¦bustiers, certain it is, there were about five hundred in the island. Near two hun∣dred of these people had dis∣embarked at Bay Mahaut, during the siege. Part of them were employed at the batteries: the rest were form∣ed into two companies. The first of these, consisting of about two hundred and fifty, was commanded by Grand Joseph, who was killed at their head when your grena∣diers advanced to the attack of the Batterie la Mutine: the other, of fifty, was com∣manded by the sieur Roux.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the undis∣guised truth of all you desired us to explain.</P>

This does not seem like the account given of them by Mr Moore; neither is it to be in agined that the general of Martin que would trust himself with such wretches as they are repre∣sented, whose condit on could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve been re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miserable from the leng h of their voyage</P>

The general sent captain Buchanan to take away their arms, at the same time that he took away those of the different parishes of Guadaloupe and Grande-terre; but the weather was so bad, that he could not reach them within the time to which he was limited; for he was not sent till about the tenth of June, and the army was to embark the twenty-fourth for England.</P>
